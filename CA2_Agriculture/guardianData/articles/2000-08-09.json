      "body": "<p>Reinhold Messner bumped into his first yeti somewhere in Tibet. It was 1986, and he had gone for a walk on his own and got a bit lost. A walk for Reinhold Messner is not what most people mean by a walk. On this one he was trying to follow a route taken by Sherpa people centuries ago in the flight from the lands of Dege to Lhasa. That's a walk of about 1,200 miles. </p> <p>It was dusk; he was climbing a steep, densely vegetated slope. Suddenly something large and dark stepped out ahead of him. He watched it racing along in front, flitting in and out of the trees, upright like a man, but moving faster than any man could. Neither branches nor ditches slowed it down. At one point it stood motionless only 10 yards away, then disappeared. </p> <p>He saw it again, later that night, running in the moonlight. It looked more than seven feet tall and immensely strong, but agile too. Covered in hair, with short legs and long, powerful arms, it made angry hissing noises, and for a second he saw its eyes and teeth before it ran off into the trees. </p> <p>After his encounter with the strange beast, Messner became obsessed. He spent a large part of the following 12 years chasing yetis round the Himalayas - Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, India, Mongolia, Kazakhstan - trying to get to the bottom of a myth that has been around since Alexander the Great heard of them when he went to conquer the Indus valley in 326BC. Now he thinks he has solved the mystery, and has written a book about it. </p> <p>If you know anything at all about climbing, you will have heard of Messner. The German-speaking Tyrolean Italian is probably the greatest mountaineer alive. The American climber Jon Krakauer says: \"Messner is to climbing what Michael Jordan is to basketball.\" If you don't know anything about basketball think Tiger Woods, Michael Schumacher, Zinedine Zidane. Or Pele, because Messner is now 55 and cannot quite do what he used to - a little past his peak you could say, of a man who has conquered all the major peaks of the world. </p> <p>He was the first man to climb all 14 of the 8,000m mountains, a feat impressive in itself, but more so because he did it without oxygen. In 1980, when attempts on Everest still relied on armies of Sherpas and equipment, Messner went up on his own. His single-minded passion for climbing has survived the loss of one of his brothers and all but three of his toes. And it is with that same single-minded determination that he has solved the yeti mystery. </p> <p>We meet in the highly inappropriate surroundings of the European parliament building in Brussels, as Messner is now an MEP, albeit a slightly reluctant one. His office is down a long, grey, confusingly numbered corridor. He looks out of place and a little unhappy among all that bureaucracy. There are no books on the shelves and the view from the window is over another part of the same building. \"I am not building up a political career. I will not run again. The Greens came to me. They came three times. The first two times I said no.\" </p> <p>Messner's eyes have that wild look possessed only by people who do mad things. He has a mane and beard of straggly, rusty red hair. He still looks strong, but agile . . . actually, pretty much exactly like a yeti, though a bit shorter.And he probably doesn't throw rocks at people, or abduct women but I didn't dare ask.\"Before '86 I wrote in my books the yeti is bullshit. But then when I have seen this big animal, which I could not see exactly what it was, I understood that it was exactly matching with the legend.\" Messner says \"bullshit\" a lot - not as an expletive, just as a way of saying something is wrong. I don't believe Messner often thinks he himself is wrong. Frequently, he does not really answer questions, or even hear them, but just ploughs on stubbornly. I guess that is what got him up all those mountains. He becomes animated and excited when talking about yetis and mountains in a way he had not when we had been discussing globalisation and the European Union. </p> <p>After 12 years of research and more than 20 trips to the Himalayas, scouring monasteries for relics and eventually seeing more \"yetis\" for himself in Lhasa and the Karakorum, Messner's conclusion is a little disappointing. The yeti does not exist. It is \"bullshit\", he would say, and does. There is no human-like abominable snowman living in the mountains. The yeti is in fact a Himalayan brown bear. \"In the end I thought to myself: how could I need 12 years to come to the answer? It's so obvious.\" </p> <p>Is he not disappointed? \"Not for me. Because the brown bear is really a monster.\" What about for the people who live in the Himalayas and have lived with this legend for hundreds of years? \"In the local areas they know all that - that this is an animal. But since only every 10 years someone is seeing a real example, so if they speak about it, all the children and normal people that never saw one, they are imagining they are talking about something that isn't a brown bear. We should see the yeti as the sum of the legend and the zoological reality.\" </p> <p>Messner is not the first person to realise that the yeti is nothing more than a bear. Ernst Sch\u00e4fer, who in 1939 headed a secret mission sponsored by the German Reich to incite the Tibetan army against the British, came to the same conclusion. He wrote to tell Messner this before he died in 1992. Messner recalls an encounter Sch\u00e4fer had with a yeti. \"The local people is saying to him, 'Up there in the mountains is a yeti, living in a cave,' and he say, 'Bullshit,' and he goes up with his gun and he is killing it. And he has a big Tibet bear.\" </p> <p>Both Sir Edmund Hillary and the Dalai Lama, says Messner, agree that the yeti is just a bear. So what about about all those famous footprints of huge two-legged creatures in the snow? Messner shows me with his hands how a bear might walk on all fours, but with its back feet going into the prints of the front feet to make bigger prints which would appear to be of a two-legged animal. </p> <p>It is not just the yeti myth that Messner has the answer to. Messner knows that George Mallory did not reach the summit of Everest - because of where his body was found and the shoes he was wearing. \"The second step with these shoes is impossible. He could not have done it. </p> <p>\"But most of the people in their books, they say probably he was up, because this is selling much better. If you say it was impossible he was at the summit nobody is interested.\" </p> <p>Messner may have the same problem with the yeti book. He has done a few lectures but has not had the turnout he hoped for. \"A lot of people said, 'I'm not coming for a bear.' I would have much more success if it had been the other way round - if I'd claimed that it is some big human-like creature. But this is not the answer.\" </p> <p>\u0095 My Quest for the Yeti is published by Macmillan on August 25, priced \u00a314.99.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Charles Kennedy does not need to read too many assessments of his first year as leader of the Liberal Democrats: he has already made one of his own. By his own admission, he has had a \"slow-burn start\" in the job - and there are few who would disagree. He has not enjoyed anything like the profile of his predecessor, but that is hardly a fair measure. Paddy Ashdown had 20 years to make his mark, Mr Kennedy has had just 12 months. But has he used that time wisely?</p> <p>At the top of any credit column must be the triumph of Romsey. The Lib Dems stole the seat from the Tories in a May by-election, an achievement of great audacity coming three years after the landslide Tory defeat of 1997. Losing by-elections is what happens to governments; it is not meant to happen to oppositions. It was very much Mr Kennedy's victory. He campaigned in the constituency himself, daring to go mano a mano with William Hague on the live local issue of asylum. His defence of a truly liberal position on that question was bold, and paid off.</p> <p>Mr Kennedy has also given his party a measure of clarity, concentrating his fire on three specific areas. He wants to position the Lib Dems as the party of moderate libertarianism, increased spending on public services and concern for the environment. To that end, he made his debut policy pronouncement on the decriminalisation of cannabis, followed by regular demands for Labour to spend more, coupled with lots of warm, green noises. The advantage of this approach is that it understands the limited attention span of the electorate: just getting the Lib Dems on to the national radar screen is achievement enough - transmitting more than three messages at once would clutter the airwaves.</p> <p>There are two further, rather less obvious accomplishments. Under Mr Kennedy's leadership, the Lib-Lab joint cabinet committee has met only twice. That may look like a failure for \"the project,\" but it could play well for Mr Kennedy. First, it will win over those Lib Dems who feared the new leader would be a poodle for Tony Blair. Second, it might reassure those wavering Tory voters who will come over to the Lib Dems so long as the party does not behave like a government subsidiary.</p> <p>In the same vein, Mr Kennedy can make a virtue of Labour's recent failure at its policy forum to back Roy Jenkins's plan for voting reform. Officially, Lib Dems should be disappointed, for Labour has opted instead for a model which appears no more proportional than the current system. But Mr Kennedy can tell his party that Labour's policy is at least a step away from first past the post - and that Britain's historic paralysis on electoral reform is at last being broken.</p> <p>That much the leader can be happy with. But he should not let himself off too easily. His performances in the House of Commons have been pretty dire; he has seemed faint and nervous.

      "bodyText": "Charles Kennedy does not need to read too many assessments of his first year as leader of the Liberal Democrats: he has already made one of his own. By his own admission, he has had a \"slow-burn start\" in the job - and there are few who would disagree. He has not enjoyed anything like the profile of his predecessor, but that is hardly a fair measure. Paddy Ashdown had 20 years to make his mark, Mr Kennedy has had just 12 months. But has he used that time wisely? At the top of any credit column must be the triumph of Romsey. The Lib Dems stole the seat from the Tories in a May by-election, an achievement of great audacity coming three years after the landslide Tory defeat of 1997. Losing by-elections is what happens to governments; it is not meant to happen to oppositions. It was very much Mr Kennedy's victory. He campaigned in the constituency himself, daring to go mano a mano with William Hague on the live local issue of asylum. His defence of a truly liberal position on that question was bold, and paid off. Mr Kennedy has also given his party a measure of clarity, concentrating his fire on three specific areas. He wants to position the Lib Dems as the party of moderate libertarianism, increased spending on public services and concern for the environment. To that end, he made his debut policy pronouncement on the decriminalisation of cannabis, followed by regular demands for Labour to spend more, coupled with lots of warm, green noises. The advantage of this approach is that it understands the limited attention span of the electorate: just getting the Lib Dems on to the national radar screen is achievement enough - transmitting more than three messages at once would clutter the airwaves. There are two further, rather less obvious accomplishments. Under Mr Kennedy's leadership, the Lib-Lab joint cabinet committee has met only twice. That may look like a failure for \"the project,\" but it could play well for Mr Kennedy. First, it will win over those Lib Dems who feared the new leader would be a poodle for Tony Blair. Second, it might reassure those wavering Tory voters who will come over to the Lib Dems so long as the party does not behave like a government subsidiary. In the same vein, Mr Kennedy can make a virtue of Labour's recent failure at its policy forum to back Roy Jenkins's plan for voting reform. Officially, Lib Dems should be disappointed, for Labour has opted instead for a model which appears no more proportional than the current system. But Mr Kennedy can tell his party that Labour's policy is at least a step away from first past the post - and that Britain's historic paralysis on electoral reform is at last being broken. That much the leader can be happy with. But he should not let himself off too easily. His performances in the House of Commons have been pretty dire; he has seemed faint and nervous. He may regard prime minister's questions as \"street theatre\", but his weakness on that stage matters - if only for the effect it has on his own troops. More generally, he has failed to impress. Even on television, his favourite arena, he resorts too often to political cliche and the pat answer. It is good that he is about to publish a book (though the title, The Future of Politics, is another cliche), for he really does need to gain some philosophical heft. One year on, Mr Kennedy needs to work out a strategy beyond assuming that the anti-Tory hatred of 1997 will carry him through next time round. He is a man of talents, but he has to work them much harder.",

      "body": "<p>For some in the financial markets, the Bank of England's decision to leave interest rates unchanged when inflation is projected to bust the government's 2.5% target will look like a blatant dereliction of duty. The reason we have a monetary policy committee, they would argue, is so that the authorities cannot play fast and loose with inflation. We now have a committee of Kenneth Clarkes instead of just one. </p> <p>Actually, the MPC should be applauded for its wait-and-see stance. As Mervyn King argued yesterday, there is no mechanistic link between the Bank's central projection for inflation in two years - about 2.7% - and the level of interest rates. The three-year history of the MPC shows that the Bank has consistently over-estimated the likely outturn for inflation, primarily because it has been repeatedly frustrated by sterling's refusal to fall.

      "bodyText": "For some in the financial markets, the Bank of England's decision to leave interest rates unchanged when inflation is projected to bust the government's 2.5% target will look like a blatant dereliction of duty. The reason we have a monetary policy committee, they would argue, is so that the authorities cannot play fast and loose with inflation. We now have a committee of Kenneth Clarkes instead of just one. Actually, the MPC should be applauded for its wait-and-see stance. As Mervyn King argued yesterday, there is no mechanistic link between the Bank's central projection for inflation in two years - about 2.7% - and the level of interest rates. The three-year history of the MPC shows that the Bank has consistently over-estimated the likely outturn for inflation, primarily because it has been repeatedly frustrated by sterling's refusal to fall. The high level of the pound has cut the cost of imports, helping to offset inflation generated by the domestic economy. At some point, sterling probably will fall. But that depends on the euro reversing its 19-month decline against the US dollar and nobody knows for sure when that will happen.

With nothing to put it into relief the blow of tragedy was softened and the music became repetitive. The only lighter number left in the sequence, Wouldn't You Like to Be on Broadway?, sounded as though it had wandered in from another theatre. The soloists did a good job, but the performance showed that Weill is a more heavyweight composer if you leave his \"light\" music where it was intended.",

The possibility of job cuts was also raised. </p> <p>News of the talks, widely regarded to be with Barclays' second choice for a deal, ignited the stock market amid speculation that a wave of mergers and takeovers would finally break out in the sector. Many City sources believe Mr Barrett would have preferred to clinch the agreement of Abbey National for a merger to achieve his goal of boosting mortgage market share. </p> <p>Shares in Barclays, which plans to pay for Woolwich partly with its own shares, fell 49p to \u00a316.15; Woolwich's rose to \u00a33.41 - still below the \u00a33.62 a share at which the Barclays bid was priced before yesterday's price movements. </p> <p>Among the day's fastest rises were Alliance &amp; Leicester and Northern Rock, both regarded as bid candidates. Lloyds TSB, which has built itself up through a series of mergers, fell back amid uncertainty about whether the bank would try to clinch another deal. </p> <p>As the sensitive final details of the takeover were being negotiated, speculation mounted about the roles being allocated to Barclays executives after yesterday's hastily prepared statement by the two banks. </p> <p>One of the aims was to incorporate \"Woolwich's brand, management, products and capabilities to accelerate the achievement of Barclays' strategic ambitions, particularly in retail financial services.\" </p> <p>An industry source said: \"Part of the appeal for Barclays is the Woolwich management.\" It is understood that a senior role for Woolwich finance director Richard Meddings was under discussion last night. </p> <p>The takeover talks follow a turbulent period for Barclays and mark the first major move by Mr Barrett - who became chief executive in October, just as the bid battle for his closest rival, NatWest, got under way. </p> <p>With NatWest falling to Royal Bank of Scotland, Mr Barrett found himself running a bank consigned to fourth place in the market's ranking, behind HSBC, Lloyds TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>Even with the Woolwich, Barclays would remain in fourth place but make a big leap towards closing the gap.</p>",

      "bodyText": "John Stewart, the chief executive of Woolwich, is thought to have won one of the most senior management roles at Barclays on the successful completion of the \u00a35.5bn takeover talks with its larger rival. The appointment of the Woolwich boss as deputy chief executive with special responsibility for mortgages and the net is expected to be positioned in such a way that John Varley, currently the most senior executive in the Barclays retail financial services operation, is able to cling on to his role - at least temporarily. The banks, which were yesterday forced to publish sketchy details of their \u00a35.5bn takeover talks after intense speculation, were last night racing to cement the details before a counter-bidder could step in to scupper the first strategic move by Barclays' chief executive, Matt Barrett. Among the last points to be agreed ahead of a final announcement scheduled for to morrow were which executives should fill the senior roles in the combined bank and in particular the position of Mr Varley, the head of the bank's retail financial services operation during a time of unpopular branch closures and cash machine charges. Under the terms of the Woolwich takeover both brands are to be retained via the banks' branches, although it was unclear how many would be earmarked for closure if the deal were completed. The possibility of job cuts was also raised. News of the talks, widely regarded to be with Barclays' second choice for a deal, ignited the stock market amid speculation that a wave of mergers and takeovers would finally break out in the sector. Many City sources believe Mr Barrett would have preferred to clinch the agreement of Abbey National for a merger to achieve his goal of boosting mortgage market share. Shares in Barclays, which plans to pay for Woolwich partly with its own shares, fell 49p to \u00a316.15; Woolwich's rose to \u00a33.41 - still below the \u00a33.62 a share at which the Barclays bid was priced before yesterday's price movements. Among the day's fastest rises were Alliance &amp; Leicester and Northern Rock, both regarded as bid candidates. Lloyds TSB, which has built itself up through a series of mergers, fell back amid uncertainty about whether the bank would try to clinch another deal. As the sensitive final details of the takeover were being negotiated, speculation mounted about the roles being allocated to Barclays executives after yesterday's hastily prepared statement by the two banks. One of the aims was to incorporate \"Woolwich's brand, management, products and capabilities to accelerate the achievement of Barclays' strategic ambitions, particularly in retail financial services.\" An industry source said: \"Part of the appeal for Barclays is the Woolwich management.\" It is understood that a senior role for Woolwich finance director Richard Meddings was under discussion last night. The takeover talks follow a turbulent period for Barclays and mark the first major move by Mr Barrett - who became chief executive in October, just as the bid battle for his closest rival, NatWest, got under way. With NatWest falling to Royal Bank of Scotland, Mr Barrett found himself running a bank consigned to fourth place in the market's ranking, behind HSBC, Lloyds TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland. Even with the Woolwich, Barclays would remain in fourth place but make a big leap towards closing the gap.",

      "body": "<p>A shot that does not call for tracks <br> Is agony for poor dear Max, <br> Who, separated from his dolly, <br> Is wrapped in deepest melancholy. </p> <p>James Mason </p> <p> At the beginning of Max Ophuls's 1950 movie La Ronde, the Master of Ceremonies walks through a film studio on to a fin de si\u00e8cle set, changes into an opera cloak, begins to sing an Oscar Straus waltz and spins a merry-go-round. It is a carousel of deceit, on which lovers meet. Then one of them turns to another, then that other turns to another, and so on until the circle is completed. At one point, the MC snips a length of film with a pair of scissors. </p> <p>He is the alter ego of Max Ophuls, whose films are merry-go-rounds, moving to the sound of a waltz or a rondo capriccio as the camera tracks and circles. Like the couples in La Ronde, the earrings of Madame De... (1953) are passed from hand to hand until they, too, come full circle. In Lola Mont\u00e8s (1955) the ringmaster (Peter Ustinov), another of the director's surrogates, cracks his whip as the notorious courtesan, now reduced to a circus attraction, reminisces and the camera revolves 360 degrees to reveal her past. </p> <p>The past returns in Leibelei (1932) as the camera tracks around the room where the doomed couple were happy, she having jumped to her death after he is killed in a duel. Similarly, the past is relived as the concert pianist reads the Letter From An Unknown Woman (1948), who is dead, just before he is likely to be killed in a duel. Love is Ophuls's theme and, as it is transitory - it exists in the past - the tracking, circling camera suggests time passing. \"I adore the past. It is more restful than the present and more sure than the future,\" says the MC in La Ronde. </p> <p>Ophuls, the subject of a retrospective at this year's Edinburgh film festival, does not wallow in nostalgia but summons up 19th-century Vienna or the Second Empire as part of the whirl of destiny in a danse macabre. For years, critics saw only the radiant surface and dismissed Ophuls as a minor director whose decorous style was but shallow artifice, his plots quaintly old-fashioned. However, like Viennese coffee, whipped cream covers bitterness. As Charles Boyer says in Madame De...: \"It seems superficial superficially.\" His films are exquisite treatises on the mortality of love, nearly all of them seen from a female perspective. </p> <p>Ophuls's life was as restless as his camera: he moved from Germany to Italy to Holland to France to Hollywood, then back to Paris after the second world war. He was born Max Oppenheimer in 1902 in Sarrebr\u00fcck, the son of a German-Jewish department store owner. To protect his family's reputation he changed his name when he entered the \"disreputable\" entertainment business. (In Hollywood, it was changed again briefly to Max Opuls so that, according to some mogul, nobody would confuse it with \"offal\" or \"awful\".) </p> <p>In Germany, Ophuls was a celebrated stage director who turned his hand to films when talkies came in. The second of them was a wonderfully sung (in German) performance of Smetana's delightful Czech opera The Bartered Bride (1932). Not content merely to record the opera, the director managed, by complex cam era angles, to present his own comment on the filming of opera. </p> <p>His last film in Germany, before the Reichstag fire indicated it was time for him and his family to leave, was Leibelei, an adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's play of doomed love. Far less ironic and more romantic than the play (witness the invigorating sleigh ride), the film's emphasis is on music, sound and camera movement rather than dialogue. </p> <p>Schnitzler was also the source for La Ronde, and for Stanley Kubrick's final film, Eyes Wide Shut - an attempt to emulate Ophuls. Kubrick once said: \"Highest of all I would rate Max Ophuls, who for me possessed every possible quality. He has an exceptional flair for sniffing out good subjects, and he got the most out of them. He was also a marvellous director of actors.\" </p> <p>Schnitzler was a doctor as well as a writer, and, like his Viennese contemporary Sigmund Freud, he had an abiding interest in the way sex shapes people's lives. This theme runs through the films Ophuls made as an exile in France in the 30s. </p> <p>Divine is about an innocent country girl who comes to Paris where she becomes a chorus girl, gets involved with a dope-peddling snake charmer, a milkman and a lesbian, who fancies her. Though the film was dismissed at the time, Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut later called it \"a real little masterpiece, with, naturally, that Ophulsian frenzy which drives the camera up staircases, into the flies, in and out of the wings\". Ophuls then turned Goethe's 18th-century tale Werther into a wild 19th-century romance, shifting the tragedy from the hero to the heroine. (He later considered he had betrayed his beloved Goethe, a copy of whose Faust was beside his bed when he died in hospital in Hamburg in 1957 aged 55.) </p> <p>Mayerling to Sarajevo, his last completed film before his departure for the US, found Ophuls relishing the sort of thing he did best - casting an ironic eye on the extravagances and absurdities of the aristocracy and portraying a bitter-sweet romance against a background of balls, operas and rides through the woods. </p> <p>Ophuls arrived in Hollywood in 1941, and had to wait six years before he was given a film to direct. Like other European auteurs at the time, such as Jean Renoir and Fritz Lang, he was treated shabbily by the American film industry. He didn't have much liberty on his first American film, a rarely seen costume drama The Exile (1947), shot in sepia tones, starring Douglas Fairbanks Jr as the exiled Charles II of England. (Two endings were shot: the never-before-seen one will be shown at Edinburgh in a new print.) He also made two brooding films noirs, Caught and The Reckless Moment (both 1949), starring James Mason as romantic doctor and slimy blackmailer respectively - rare instances of Ophuls dealing with a contemporary setting. The only film he made in the US that suggests the European period, and one of the best of that underestimated genre \"the women's picture\", was Letter From an Unknown Woman (1948), a heart-rending tale in which turn-of-the-century Vienna is lovingly recreated. </p> <p>In 1949, Ophuls returned to Paris, where he made his last four masterpieces: La Ronde; Le Plaisir (1952), based on three Guy de Maupassant stories; Madame De...; and Lola Mont\u00e8s - his only work in colour. </p> <p>In the first story in Le Plaisir, a masked dancer sweeps into a dance hall, the camera moving with him as he whirls and whirls, the music getting livelier until he falls. Madame De... has a dizzying sequence in which a couple (Danielle Darrieux and Vittorio De Sica) dance from ball to ball as their relationship deepens. Lola Mont\u00e8s tells the story of Lola's love affairs with, among others, Franz Liszt, King Ludwig I of Bavaria and a student. The extraordinary treatment of space on the CinemaScope screen (using masking and other devices), the crane shots and elaborate camera movements have the virtuosity of a Liszt sonata. It was an expensive film that lost a great deal of money, and was shown in a heavily cut version for years. Ophuls, who had been suffering from a cardiac problem, spent his last two years fighting to prevent the movie from being shown in the mutilated form. He died not long after its disastrous release. However, the restored film is now considered a classic. </p> <p>\u0095 The Max Ophuls retrospective starts on August 14 as part of the Edinburgh film festival (0131-623 8030) and will be followed by a season at the National Film Theatre in September</p>",

But Ridiculusmus use comedy to make serious political points: in particular, that Northern Ireland is a society based on love of the mask and that it is pure delusion to imagine that sectarian hatred has been banished by the peace process. \u0095 The Bogus Woman and Say Nothing are at the Traverse (0131-228 1404) till August 13 and 26.",

      "body": "<p>To borrow an infamous phrase from Karl Marx, a spectre is haunting Ireland - the spectre of republican dissent.</p> <p>Almost exactly two years ago following the Omagh bomb atrocity the Provisional IRA organised a programme of mass intimidation directed at their former comrades responsible for the massacre.</p> <p>Senior PIRA activists from Belfast travelled to Dundalk and other border strongholds of the Real IRA to warn them that if they did not desist from armed activity they would be attacked.</p> <p>National and international outrage compounded by PIRA threats forced the Real IRA in the wake of Omagh to call a ceasefire. The homes of those associated with the anti-ceasefire republican organisation, particularly the Real IRA\u00d5s alleged leader Michael McKevitt, were picketed by ordinary citizens of Dundalk who were disgusted that their town was seen as a support base for the terror group.</p> <p>Two years on and the Real IRA are back in business. The first year of the 21st century has seen a marked increase in republican dissident activity illustrating that despite the Good Friday Agreement and the historic compromise with unionism, there are some republicans willing to continue their \"armed struggle\" to achieve the traditional goal of a united Ireland.</p> <p>There have been 14 attacks against the security forces in Northern Ireland and strategic targets in Britain so far this year, most carried out by the Real IRA. They have included bombs on Hammersmith Bridge, which threw large sections of west London into traffic chaos. The Real IRA placed similar devices at railway stations last month with the aim of disrupting the Queen Mother\u00d5s 100th birthday celebrations. There was a sophisticated attempt to kill British soldiers on the Belfast to Dublin railway line using a secondary explosive which, if troops had fallen for the bait, would have been triggered by a mobile phone. The organisation has also acquired sophisticated anti-jamming devices in the former Yugoslavia make it more difficult for the British Army to defuse bombs.</p> <p>Two years ago the Real IRA and their political allies, the 32 County Sovereignty Committee, feared for their lives following the Omagh bomb believing they were about to be attacked by the Provisional IRA. Now the organisation feels confident enough to hold a fundraising event for its 33 prisoners held in jails in Britain and Ireland in the heart of Gerry Adams\u00d5s West Belfast constituency next week.</p> <p>The Sinn Fein president complained yesterday that the Real IRA threat was merely a \"spectre\" being used by security chiefs in Northern Ireland to block further de-militarisation in republican redoubts like south Armagh. However, according to senior Irish government sources, Mr Adams used the spectre of the Real IRA earlier this year to urge Dublin to pressurise the British to quicken the pace of reform, especially in relation to policing. The Sinn Fein leadership argued at the time that the dissidents were growing in places like south Armagh and that only more change in nationalists\u00d5 favour could halt their advance.</p> <p>On the one hand, Gerry Adams argues that the dissent threat is exaggerated by the British in order to slow down de-militarisation in areas where the Real IRA are in reality getting stronger by the day and, on the other, he uses the spectre to frighten Dublin into backing his demands for faster change regardless of unionist concerns.</p> <p>Whatever way you look at it, the organisation which killed 29 men, women and children two years ago this month at Omagh are still colouring the agenda of the Northern Ireland peace process.</p>",

      "bodyText": "To borrow an infamous phrase from Karl Marx, a spectre is haunting Ireland - the spectre of republican dissent. Almost exactly two years ago following the Omagh bomb atrocity the Provisional IRA organised a programme of mass intimidation directed at their former comrades responsible for the massacre. Senior PIRA activists from Belfast travelled to Dundalk and other border strongholds of the Real IRA to warn them that if they did not desist from armed activity they would be attacked. National and international outrage compounded by PIRA threats forced the Real IRA in the wake of Omagh to call a ceasefire. The homes of those associated with the anti-ceasefire republican organisation, particularly the Real IRA\u00d5s alleged leader Michael McKevitt, were picketed by ordinary citizens of Dundalk who were disgusted that their town was seen as a support base for the terror group. Two years on and the Real IRA are back in business. The first year of the 21st century has seen a marked increase in republican dissident activity illustrating that despite the Good Friday Agreement and the historic compromise with unionism, there are some republicans willing to continue their \"armed struggle\" to achieve the traditional goal of a united Ireland. There have been 14 attacks against the security forces in Northern Ireland and strategic targets in Britain so far this year, most carried out by the Real IRA. They have included bombs on Hammersmith Bridge, which threw large sections of west London into traffic chaos. The Real IRA placed similar devices at railway stations last month with the aim of disrupting the Queen Mother\u00d5s 100th birthday celebrations. There was a sophisticated attempt to kill British soldiers on the Belfast to Dublin railway line using a secondary explosive which, if troops had fallen for the bait, would have been triggered by a mobile phone. The organisation has also acquired sophisticated anti-jamming devices in the former Yugoslavia make it more difficult for the British Army to defuse bombs. Two years ago the Real IRA and their political allies, the 32 County Sovereignty Committee, feared for their lives following the Omagh bomb believing they were about to be attacked by the Provisional IRA. Now the organisation feels confident enough to hold a fundraising event for its 33 prisoners held in jails in Britain and Ireland in the heart of Gerry Adams\u00d5s West Belfast constituency next week. The Sinn Fein president complained yesterday that the Real IRA threat was merely a \"spectre\" being used by security chiefs in Northern Ireland to block further de-militarisation in republican redoubts like south Armagh. However, according to senior Irish government sources, Mr Adams used the spectre of the Real IRA earlier this year to urge Dublin to pressurise the British to quicken the pace of reform, especially in relation to policing. The Sinn Fein leadership argued at the time that the dissidents were growing in places like south Armagh and that only more change in nationalists\u00d5 favour could halt their advance. On the one hand, Gerry Adams argues that the dissent threat is exaggerated by the British in order to slow down de-militarisation in areas where the Real IRA are in reality getting stronger by the day and, on the other, he uses the spectre to frighten Dublin into backing his demands for faster change regardless of unionist concerns. Whatever way you look at it, the organisation which killed 29 men, women and children two years ago this month at Omagh are still colouring the agenda of the Northern Ireland peace process.",

      "body": "<p>What would happen to your children if you and your partner died? A terrible question, but one every parent should face; if you do not and the worst happens, you will have failed your children in their hour of greatest need. But knowing that does not make the practicalities any easier - especially if, like me, you have not just one, not just two, but three children to think about. </p> <p>\"Oh, don't worry, I'd have Miranda,\" trills my dearest friend, who is also my baby's godmother. But what about the other two? A moment's pause, as the enormity of what I am asking sinks in, and Emma imagines how she would feel as a mother of five. We joke about how unlikely it is to happen, but just occasionally it does. And taking on three bereaved young children is certainly a lot to ask of any friend. </p> <p>Most couples ask family members, but for an increasing number that does not seem the best course. Leaving them to your parents does not make a lot of sense - even if they are fit and healthy today, if you died in five years their situation could be very different. Brothers and sisters with children are the obvious choice, but in our case we only have one sibling between us with children. Solicitor John Pears, who chairs the Law Society's probate section, suggests that you solve the conundrum by thinking of who you would want your children to be with if you were not around any more. \"It's going to be someone they know well, who sees them on a regular basis, and that often narrows it down,\" he says. </p> <p>Peter Norman, a senior educational psychologist working in Buckinghamshire and a specialist in dealing with bereaved children, says your children's ages are crucial - a 13-year-old will be more adaptable than a two-year-old, for example. </p> <p>\"I'd say there are three basic areas to be aware of. Firstly, the new carer's relationship with the child - you want someone who knows them as well as possible. Secondly, a similarity of situation - if you can avoid uprooting them, especially under-sevens, so much the better. Thirdly, you want someone who is familiar with children, ideally someone who either has similar-aged children themselves or has older children.\" </p> <p>Whomever you choose, you have got to think about financial considerations as well as the children's welfare. \"You've got to be aware of how the guardians will finance bringing your children up,\" says Pears. \"Usually parents leave their money to their children in the event of their death, but they leave to the guardians the right to get at the money if they need to. For example, they may need to extend their home, or even buy a new house. You can't expect them to be at a financial disadvantage as a result of raising your children.\" </p> <p>If you die without making a will, whoever does take on the responsibility of bringing up your kids will be at a definite disadvantage when it comes to money - because only appointed guardians have the right to get their hands on the cash. </p> <p>\"What many couples do is write what's known as a 'letter of wishes' to be kept with their will, and this spells out what their hopes are for the years ahead for their children,\" says Pears. </p> <p>Jackie Deakin wishes her brother had written his wishes down before he died. Although he and his wife lived in Corsica, Jackie knew he hoped to educate his son, Olivier, in England. But when her brother was killed in a car accident she realised that she did not have anything in writing to justify persuading her sister-in-law to allow her son to live in Britain. \"It was tough, because I always felt we were prising him away from her,\" says Jackie. \"If my brother had written it down, we'd have all known we were doing what he wanted.\" </p> <p>Olivier came to live with Jackie and her family in Yorkshire for two years, but eventually decided to return to his mother in Corsica. She regrets that she could not fulfil her brother's wishes. \"The thing is that you never foresee tragedy; you never think you need to write anything down. But you do - after my brother's death, my sister and I both got very serious about making sure the other knew what to do in the event of our deaths.\" </p> <p>According to Pears, it is often a family tragedy like this that galvanises couples into action when it comes to will-making. Despite campaigns by the Law Society, only a third of us in the UK have made a will - the same proportion as 10 years ago. Pears says some people feel superstitious about it, while others think it is unnecessary and some just put it off again and again. </p> <p>A lot of people assume that, whether they make a will or not, their estate will go to their partner in the event of their death.

      "bodyText": "What would happen to your children if you and your partner died? A terrible question, but one every parent should face; if you do not and the worst happens, you will have failed your children in their hour of greatest need. But knowing that does not make the practicalities any easier - especially if, like me, you have not just one, not just two, but three children to think about. \"Oh, don't worry, I'd have Miranda,\" trills my dearest friend, who is also my baby's godmother. But what about the other two? A moment's pause, as the enormity of what I am asking sinks in, and Emma imagines how she would feel as a mother of five. We joke about how unlikely it is to happen, but just occasionally it does. And taking on three bereaved young children is certainly a lot to ask of any friend. Most couples ask family members, but for an increasing number that does not seem the best course. Leaving them to your parents does not make a lot of sense - even if they are fit and healthy today, if you died in five years their situation could be very different. Brothers and sisters with children are the obvious choice, but in our case we only have one sibling between us with children. Solicitor John Pears, who chairs the Law Society's probate section, suggests that you solve the conundrum by thinking of who you would want your children to be with if you were not around any more. \"It's going to be someone they know well, who sees them on a regular basis, and that often narrows it down,\" he says. Peter Norman, a senior educational psychologist working in Buckinghamshire and a specialist in dealing with bereaved children, says your children's ages are crucial - a 13-year-old will be more adaptable than a two-year-old, for example. \"I'd say there are three basic areas to be aware of. Firstly, the new carer's relationship with the child - you want someone who knows them as well as possible. Secondly, a similarity of situation - if you can avoid uprooting them, especially under-sevens, so much the better. Thirdly, you want someone who is familiar with children, ideally someone who either has similar-aged children themselves or has older children.\" Whomever you choose, you have got to think about financial considerations as well as the children's welfare. \"You've got to be aware of how the guardians will finance bringing your children up,\" says Pears. \"Usually parents leave their money to their children in the event of their death, but they leave to the guardians the right to get at the money if they need to. For example, they may need to extend their home, or even buy a new house. You can't expect them to be at a financial disadvantage as a result of raising your children.\" If you die without making a will, whoever does take on the responsibility of bringing up your kids will be at a definite disadvantage when it comes to money - because only appointed guardians have the right to get their hands on the cash. \"What many couples do is write what's known as a 'letter of wishes' to be kept with their will, and this spells out what their hopes are for the years ahead for their children,\" says Pears. Jackie Deakin wishes her brother had written his wishes down before he died. Although he and his wife lived in Corsica, Jackie knew he hoped to educate his son, Olivier, in England. But when her brother was killed in a car accident she realised that she did not have anything in writing to justify persuading her sister-in-law to allow her son to live in Britain. \"It was tough, because I always felt we were prising him away from her,\" says Jackie. \"If my brother had written it down, we'd have all known we were doing what he wanted.\" Olivier came to live with Jackie and her family in Yorkshire for two years, but eventually decided to return to his mother in Corsica. She regrets that she could not fulfil her brother's wishes. \"The thing is that you never foresee tragedy; you never think you need to write anything down. But you do - after my brother's death, my sister and I both got very serious about making sure the other knew what to do in the event of our deaths.\" According to Pears, it is often a family tragedy like this that galvanises couples into action when it comes to will-making. Despite campaigns by the Law Society, only a third of us in the UK have made a will - the same proportion as 10 years ago. Pears says some people feel superstitious about it, while others think it is unnecessary and some just put it off again and again. A lot of people assume that, whether they make a will or not, their estate will go to their partner in the event of their death. Not so, says Richard Bark-Jones, a probate lawyer. \"If you die without making a will you die intestate and intestacy rules apply,\" he says. \"They're quite complicated, but what they mean in general is that the first \u00a3125,000 you leave goes to your husband. Anything more is divided in half - half for your children and half for your husband. What goes to him, though, doesn't go outright - it's put in trust and all he gets is the interest from the trust. Often it's very far from what someone might have intended,\" says Bark-Jones. If you and your partner are not married, the case for making a will is even stronger because you do not have any rights under the intestacy rules. There has been a recent change which allows a bereaved partner of more than two years' standing to apply to the courts for provision from the estate - but there is no automatic provision, and there would inevitably be lots of legal wrangling. So what should you do? Well, see a solicitor. According to Bark-Jones, it really is safest to fork out the \u00a380 or \u00a3100 that you are likely to spend on \"mirror wills\" for you and your partner. Do not buy an off-the-shelf will because it is easy to make a mistake, and do not go to a will-writing service unless you are sure that they are qualified (they do not have to be lawyers) and that they have got insurance.

      "body": "<p> 'Natural\", \"birth\" or, disparagingly, \"sperm\" father: there is a variety of terms to describe men whose children have been adopted. Such fathers are shadowy figures, mostly assumed to be feckless lads or wicked seducers and abandoners. While the emotional and physical connection of birth mothers to the adopted child is now widely acknowledged, most people would question any such acknowledgment in relation to fathers. Indeed, there is little acknowledgment of their fatherhood in any sense. </p> <p>However, I have just completed research - the first in the UK - to provide a glimpse into the experience and inner worlds of birth fathers and their perceptions of themselves as fathers. Thirty men, all teenagers at the time of conception, responded to an appeal for birth fathers to tell their stories. I spoke to men from places as far apart as Dundee and Southampton. The occupations and social classes of the 30 men were just as wide-ranging, and included a general practitioner in Surrey and a bus driver in Clydebank. The youngest was 35, the eldest 79 and living in a retirement home. </p> <p>These men were eager to talk of their experiences of their girlfriend's pregnancy, the birth and adoption, and of immediate post-adoption events. They also spoke of their thoughts about the child in later life and the effects of the adoption on their own lives and subsequent relationships. A central finding - one that many may find surprising - is that these men cared and still do, some more deeply than others, but all seriously and durably. Martin, a 39-year-old factory worker from Essex, spoke for many of the interviewees when he said: \"Mine has been a life of pining for my daughter.\" </p> <p>Some of the men attended the birth, although the majority were excluded from this and the subsequent adoption proceedings. A number of men had highly specific memories of holding their child. Jack, a Glaswegian labourer, is 38, but says: \"I can still remember his scent. To me, at times, it is as if it was only yesterday. I can smell him. It's always with me.\" </p> <p>However, as many birth mothers have reported, parents and society intervened and adoption proceedings swung into action. Dave is 51 and an electrician in London. His experience is typical: \"I felt that we had no choice, no option. I felt guilty. The impression was that this was nothing to do with me. I felt isolated.\" </p> <p>A number of the men excluded from the birth and adoption process were left with highly charged feelings. Jim, 48, a car salesman from Paisley, remembers: \"A very emotional time. It was tinged with great sadness and a certain amount of loss and anger.\" Although some of the men supported the decision to have their children adopted and talked of relief, many others said they were \"devastated\". </p> <p>Michael, 58, is a supermarket manager in Sheffield. He was in the army and stationed abroad when his child was born. When he found out that the child had been adopted as a result of parental intervention, he was \"gutted and could have committed suicide. I look back and I think, how did I live through it? It was a terrible pain.\" </p> <p>There were many extreme reactions in the aftermath of the adoption. Some men got into fights and went on month-long drinking binges. John, a 47-year-old fitter from Edinburgh, said: \"I became a very angry person after she was born. I used to go to dance halls looking for trouble. I turned violent for a long time. I turned to drink sometimes.\" </p> <p>Such a depth of aftershock and self-abuse following the adoption echoes feelings described by birth mothers. Other men just closed down: \"I shut it out,\" said Dave. \"I literally put it behind me.\" Peter, a 52-year-old university lecturer from London, said that the adoption \"rubbed me out legally but not emotionally\". </p> <p>Most of the men went on to marry or establish long relationships with other partners, but 18 of these ended in divorce or separation. John simply said that he felt \"unlucky in love\". Ian, now believes that he \"got married [to someone else] on the rebound\". Others found that they were unable to talk about their feelings to partners and wives, although as Tim, a 52-year-old consultant from Rotherham, said: \"He [the baby] was always in mind. I have a kid out there. I have always remembered his birthday. It was a secret set of emotions.\" Nine out of the 30 men interviewed had had no other child than the one who been adopted. </p> <p>Some of the men became tearful as they spoke of the feelings of powerlessness and disenfranchisement at having been denied a role by parents and welfare workers at the birth, and in the proceedings surrounding the decision to have the child adopted. </p> <p>In the years that followed the adoption, thoughts of the child came to be a major influence. Colin, a 53-year-old church minister from Edinburgh, said that it was \"not long before I began peeking into prams\". They wondered whether the adoption was successful and whether their child was still alive. For some, like John, events later in their lives brought memories flooding back. After a nervous breakdown and during a session with a psychiatrist (which, coincidentally, was on the day of his adopted daughter's birthday), John collapsed: \"I had never seen the adoption as my loss, always hers - the birth mother's. I completely broke down and cried.\" </p> <p>Most of the birth fathers I interviewed were careful to make a distinction between themselves and their child's parents. Brian, 61, a retired care worker from Preston, said: \"I am his father but I am not his dad.\" However, the men also spoke of a dilemma similar to that faced by birth mothers when asked how many children they had: \"It depends who I'm speaking to,\" says Doug, a 47-year-old computer operator from Sheffield. He had two more children. \"I sometimes say I've got three. But only when I feel safe.\" </p> <p>Curiosity and concern featured highly: \"One starts to worry about if there are tremendous difficulties in his life caused either by the adoption or just because of who he is,\" said Mark, 46, a social worker from Edinburgh. \"I suspect, although I don't know because I don't have any other children, it is a sort of parental worry that I have.\" </p> <p>Other men said that they felt guilt and shame arising either from their inability to influence events at the time or a feeling of not having \"shouldered a burden\".

      "bodyText": "'Natural\", \"birth\" or, disparagingly, \"sperm\" father: there is a variety of terms to describe men whose children have been adopted. Such fathers are shadowy figures, mostly assumed to be feckless lads or wicked seducers and abandoners. While the emotional and physical connection of birth mothers to the adopted child is now widely acknowledged, most people would question any such acknowledgment in relation to fathers. Indeed, there is little acknowledgment of their fatherhood in any sense. However, I have just completed research - the first in the UK - to provide a glimpse into the experience and inner worlds of birth fathers and their perceptions of themselves as fathers. Thirty men, all teenagers at the time of conception, responded to an appeal for birth fathers to tell their stories. I spoke to men from places as far apart as Dundee and Southampton. The occupations and social classes of the 30 men were just as wide-ranging, and included a general practitioner in Surrey and a bus driver in Clydebank. The youngest was 35, the eldest 79 and living in a retirement home. These men were eager to talk of their experiences of their girlfriend's pregnancy, the birth and adoption, and of immediate post-adoption events. They also spoke of their thoughts about the child in later life and the effects of the adoption on their own lives and subsequent relationships. A central finding - one that many may find surprising - is that these men cared and still do, some more deeply than others, but all seriously and durably. Martin, a 39-year-old factory worker from Essex, spoke for many of the interviewees when he said: \"Mine has been a life of pining for my daughter.\" Some of the men attended the birth, although the majority were excluded from this and the subsequent adoption proceedings. A number of men had highly specific memories of holding their child. Jack, a Glaswegian labourer, is 38, but says: \"I can still remember his scent. To me, at times, it is as if it was only yesterday. I can smell him. It's always with me.\" However, as many birth mothers have reported, parents and society intervened and adoption proceedings swung into action. Dave is 51 and an electrician in London. His experience is typical: \"I felt that we had no choice, no option. I felt guilty. The impression was that this was nothing to do with me. I felt isolated.\" A number of the men excluded from the birth and adoption process were left with highly charged feelings. Jim, 48, a car salesman from Paisley, remembers: \"A very emotional time. It was tinged with great sadness and a certain amount of loss and anger.\" Although some of the men supported the decision to have their children adopted and talked of relief, many others said they were \"devastated\". Michael, 58, is a supermarket manager in Sheffield. He was in the army and stationed abroad when his child was born. When he found out that the child had been adopted as a result of parental intervention, he was \"gutted and could have committed suicide. I look back and I think, how did I live through it? It was a terrible pain.\" There were many extreme reactions in the aftermath of the adoption. Some men got into fights and went on month-long drinking binges. John, a 47-year-old fitter from Edinburgh, said: \"I became a very angry person after she was born. I used to go to dance halls looking for trouble. I turned violent for a long time. I turned to drink sometimes.\" Such a depth of aftershock and self-abuse following the adoption echoes feelings described by birth mothers. Other men just closed down: \"I shut it out,\" said Dave. \"I literally put it behind me.\" Peter, a 52-year-old university lecturer from London, said that the adoption \"rubbed me out legally but not emotionally\". Most of the men went on to marry or establish long relationships with other partners, but 18 of these ended in divorce or separation. John simply said that he felt \"unlucky in love\". Ian, now believes that he \"got married [to someone else] on the rebound\". Others found that they were unable to talk about their feelings to partners and wives, although as Tim, a 52-year-old consultant from Rotherham, said: \"He [the baby] was always in mind. I have a kid out there. I have always remembered his birthday. It was a secret set of emotions.\" Nine out of the 30 men interviewed had had no other child than the one who been adopted. Some of the men became tearful as they spoke of the feelings of powerlessness and disenfranchisement at having been denied a role by parents and welfare workers at the birth, and in the proceedings surrounding the decision to have the child adopted. In the years that followed the adoption, thoughts of the child came to be a major influence. Colin, a 53-year-old church minister from Edinburgh, said that it was \"not long before I began peeking into prams\". They wondered whether the adoption was successful and whether their child was still alive. For some, like John, events later in their lives brought memories flooding back. After a nervous breakdown and during a session with a psychiatrist (which, coincidentally, was on the day of his adopted daughter's birthday), John collapsed: \"I had never seen the adoption as my loss, always hers - the birth mother's. I completely broke down and cried.\" Most of the birth fathers I interviewed were careful to make a distinction between themselves and their child's parents. Brian, 61, a retired care worker from Preston, said: \"I am his father but I am not his dad.\" However, the men also spoke of a dilemma similar to that faced by birth mothers when asked how many children they had: \"It depends who I'm speaking to,\" says Doug, a 47-year-old computer operator from Sheffield. He had two more children. \"I sometimes say I've got three. But only when I feel safe.\" Curiosity and concern featured highly: \"One starts to worry about if there are tremendous difficulties in his life caused either by the adoption or just because of who he is,\" said Mark, 46, a social worker from Edinburgh. \"I suspect, although I don't know because I don't have any other children, it is a sort of parental worry that I have.\" Other men said that they felt guilt and shame arising either from their inability to influence events at the time or a feeling of not having \"shouldered a burden\". Many men felt a need to apologise and \"set the story straight\". All wanted to have contact or knowledge of their child's welfare. Two of the 30 - Joe, 59, a clerical officer from Cambridge, and Michael - had spent hundreds of pounds trawling blindly through records in the hope of turning up some identifying information that could assist in finding out how their children had fared. Although far outnumbered by birth mothers, a count of three UK adoption contact registers revealed that nearly 1,000 birth fathers were registered as interested in contact with their adopted children. It may come as a surprise that birth fathers can feel as haunted by the child's absence as birth mothers do. I am sure, however, that this capacity should be cherished and nurtured, not ignored or denigrated. This would mean among other things that we accept the existence of birth fathers in any current adoptions and support moves to make contact easier between both birth parents and their children. \u0095 Gary Clapton is 51.

      "body": "<p>In some metropolitan circles, young black men are seen as cool. But a sizeable proportion of the white population fears them because they are so often portrayed as criminal, socially irresponsible and violent. White fear is also fuelled by the perception that they are unstable and prone to mental illness. But many black people are similarly fearful - not only of racism in general, but of what they regard as racial discrimination in the operation of Britain's mental health system. </p> <p>These circles of fear have helped to prevent much-needed change in our mental health professions and institutions and today, in Birmingham, a small step is being taken to try to undo this paralysis. A meeting of black service users, carers and local mental health agencies is being held as part of the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health's Breaking the Circles of Fear project. Two similar meetings have already taken place in London. </p> <p>Frank Keating, senior research fellow for the project, explains that it is trying to explore impediments to change and investigate models that really work for black communities. He says evidence of discrimination - intended or unintended - has been available for 15 years and he thinks it is time for everybody involved in mental health to move on. </p> <p>This evidence shows that people from African and African-Caribbean communities are between three and 13 times more likely than others to be admitted to hospital under the Mental Health Act. The prevalence of mental illness among black prisoners is three times higher than among their white counterparts.

      "bodyText": "In some metropolitan circles, young black men are seen as cool. But a sizeable proportion of the white population fears them because they are so often portrayed as criminal, socially irresponsible and violent. White fear is also fuelled by the perception that they are unstable and prone to mental illness. But many black people are similarly fearful - not only of racism in general, but of what they regard as racial discrimination in the operation of Britain's mental health system. These circles of fear have helped to prevent much-needed change in our mental health professions and institutions and today, in Birmingham, a small step is being taken to try to undo this paralysis. A meeting of black service users, carers and local mental health agencies is being held as part of the Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health's Breaking the Circles of Fear project. Two similar meetings have already taken place in London. Frank Keating, senior research fellow for the project, explains that it is trying to explore impediments to change and investigate models that really work for black communities. He says evidence of discrimination - intended or unintended - has been available for 15 years and he thinks it is time for everybody involved in mental health to move on. This evidence shows that people from African and African-Caribbean communities are between three and 13 times more likely than others to be admitted to hospital under the Mental Health Act. The prevalence of mental illness among black prisoners is three times higher than among their white counterparts. Black patients are given higher doses of neuroleptic drugs, are more likely to receive electro-convulsive therapy or be subject to restraint, and are less likely to be offered psychotherapy or other alternative treatments.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Reforming a sacred cow</strong></p> <p> Roy Lilley (Trapped in the twilight zone, August 2) repeats tired old anecdotes and cliche solutions for the NHS. His comments will be offensive to many. And I agree with almost everything he says. </p> <p>Doctors in the UK work two to three times as many hours as most contracted workers, yet we still earn less in total than comparable professionals. I have regularly worked flat out for 24 to 36 hours for a lower hourly pay rate than the cleaners. So forgive us for appearing bitter when government, taxpayers, and the media attack us as God-complex, privileged toffs or \"forces of conservatism\". </p> <p>We welcome an expanded role for nurses in protocolised aspects of care. I would love to work in a system capable of complete efficient service delivery 24 hours a day. I accept that staff must be more creative and adaptable. </p> <p>Lilley contrasts NHS service quality with that of optician, laundry and exhaust-fitting industries. Fair, but simplistic. The biggest difference is that money follows these services, on a proper cost-incurred basis. If we want a proper health care system, we need investment. That is why I support the government's plan for the NHS, with the exception of some punitive aspects of the proposed contract for senior doctors. </p> <p>Many parts of the plan are bold, imaginative, and highly commendable - a lifeboat in the short to medium term. If it fails, we must abandon our 52-year-old sacred cow and resort to an insurance-funded system that forces the population to spend more on health care than holidays, nights out, furniture, fashion, beer and fags. </p> <p> <strong> Dr Elved Roberts</strong></p> <p> Cardiac research fellow<br>London </p> <p>So Roy Lilley believes that doctors think shopping at midnight is unexceptional, but resist opening primary care services at weekends. Perhaps his accountant is prepared to see him in his office on a Sunday to discuss his tax return, and perhaps his solicitor sees him at midnight to discuss his will or help with conveyancing. </p> <p>Doctors, like solicitors, do see people in emergencies of course. Indeed, GPs are responsible for their patients' care 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. But there is no medical evidence that providing routine care outside normal hours (usually 8am to 6pm Monday to Friday and on Saturday mornings) would improve the nation's health. It might be more convenient for the busy businessman, but if this is so then he could be accommodated in the private sector. </p> <p>Doctors have families too and deserve to have family-friendly working patterns like everyone else. So do their staff. </p> <p><strong> Dr Amanda Lindsay</strong><br>Leeds </p> <p>Roy Lilley obviously learned very little from his tenure as a trust chairman. The staff attitudes he decries are chiefly a result of non-clinical managers (such as himself) interfering with, and judging, working practices they do not understand. </p> <p>Also, did his friend with the cut finger not have plasters and Dettol at home, or a GP to go to? It is precisely such minor injuries that gum up the working of an A&amp;E department and lead to people having to wait. I wonder that Lilley did not call an ambulance! </p> <p> <strong> Adam Walker</strong><br> University of Hertfordshire</p> <p>Roy Lilley is right to suggest that we should expect more from the NHS than we do and that NHS staff should bring their own expectations of good service to work. </p> <p>I returned from holiday this week to find an NHS outpatient appointment waiting for me. However, rather than being with the consultant to which my GP had referred me, the appointment was with a different consultant (and from previous personal experience, arrogant, patronising and unpleasant). I telephoned the outpatient department and although they did change the appointment, I was told this was routinely done if one consultant had a longer waiting list (ie was less popular) than another. </p> <p>If I go out for a meal and decide on an Indian restaurant, I do not expect to be shown to a table in a bistro across the road. Why should this be acceptable in the NHS? </p> <p><strong> Rosemary Gillespie</strong><br>Portsmouth </p> <p><strong> Measuring wealth</strong></p> <p> I suppose you would expect someone writing from the National Training Organisation for Engineering Manufacture to say that \"wealth creation is caused by a vibrant engineering and manufacturing community\" (letters, August 2). But it really is absolute nonsense and certainly should not appear in Society, of all places. </p> <p>If \"wealth creation\" means anything (other than making lots of money), it includes all the things which improve people's lives: not only televisions and motor cars, but education, hospitals and social work, hairdressing, holidays and pubs and all the other services we rely on. It is true the UK had a tradition of exporting manufactures, but that has changed. </p> <p>The reality behind the economy is that people produce goods and services which they or others then consume.

      "bodyText": "Reforming a sacred cow Roy Lilley (Trapped in the twilight zone, August 2) repeats tired old anecdotes and cliche solutions for the NHS. His comments will be offensive to many. And I agree with almost everything he says. Doctors in the UK work two to three times as many hours as most contracted workers, yet we still earn less in total than comparable professionals. I have regularly worked flat out for 24 to 36 hours for a lower hourly pay rate than the cleaners. So forgive us for appearing bitter when government, taxpayers, and the media attack us as God-complex, privileged toffs or \"forces of conservatism\". We welcome an expanded role for nurses in protocolised aspects of care. I would love to work in a system capable of complete efficient service delivery 24 hours a day. I accept that staff must be more creative and adaptable. Lilley contrasts NHS service quality with that of optician, laundry and exhaust-fitting industries. Fair, but simplistic. The biggest difference is that money follows these services, on a proper cost-incurred basis. If we want a proper health care system, we need investment. That is why I support the government's plan for the NHS, with the exception of some punitive aspects of the proposed contract for senior doctors. Many parts of the plan are bold, imaginative, and highly commendable - a lifeboat in the short to medium term. If it fails, we must abandon our 52-year-old sacred cow and resort to an insurance-funded system that forces the population to spend more on health care than holidays, nights out, furniture, fashion, beer and fags. Dr Elved Roberts Cardiac research fellow London So Roy Lilley believes that doctors think shopping at midnight is unexceptional, but resist opening primary care services at weekends. Perhaps his accountant is prepared to see him in his office on a Sunday to discuss his tax return, and perhaps his solicitor sees him at midnight to discuss his will or help with conveyancing. Doctors, like solicitors, do see people in emergencies of course. Indeed, GPs are responsible for their patients' care 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. But there is no medical evidence that providing routine care outside normal hours (usually 8am to 6pm Monday to Friday and on Saturday mornings) would improve the nation's health. It might be more convenient for the busy businessman, but if this is so then he could be accommodated in the private sector. Doctors have families too and deserve to have family-friendly working patterns like everyone else. So do their staff. Dr Amanda Lindsay Leeds Roy Lilley obviously learned very little from his tenure as a trust chairman. The staff attitudes he decries are chiefly a result of non-clinical managers (such as himself) interfering with, and judging, working practices they do not understand. Also, did his friend with the cut finger not have plasters and Dettol at home, or a GP to go to? It is precisely such minor injuries that gum up the working of an A&amp;E department and lead to people having to wait. I wonder that Lilley did not call an ambulance! Adam Walker University of Hertfordshire Roy Lilley is right to suggest that we should expect more from the NHS than we do and that NHS staff should bring their own expectations of good service to work. I returned from holiday this week to find an NHS outpatient appointment waiting for me. However, rather than being with the consultant to which my GP had referred me, the appointment was with a different consultant (and from previous personal experience, arrogant, patronising and unpleasant). I telephoned the outpatient department and although they did change the appointment, I was told this was routinely done if one consultant had a longer waiting list (ie was less popular) than another. If I go out for a meal and decide on an Indian restaurant, I do not expect to be shown to a table in a bistro across the road. Why should this be acceptable in the NHS? Rosemary Gillespie Portsmouth Measuring wealth I suppose you would expect someone writing from the National Training Organisation for Engineering Manufacture to say that \"wealth creation is caused by a vibrant engineering and manufacturing community\" (letters, August 2). But it really is absolute nonsense and certainly should not appear in Society, of all places. If \"wealth creation\" means anything (other than making lots of money), it includes all the things which improve people's lives: not only televisions and motor cars, but education, hospitals and social work, hairdressing, holidays and pubs and all the other services we rely on. It is true the UK had a tradition of exporting manufactures, but that has changed. The reality behind the economy is that people produce goods and services which they or others then consume. If we all bore this in mind, we would be able to see what the important issues are and perhaps do something more to concentrate on the important outcome, which, in the broadest sense, is the improvement of people's lives.

So far there is not enough evidence of advantage either way. At least consumer concern has forced both sets of complacent authorities to research the issue thoroughly.",

      "body": "<p>Between 1920 and 1960, more than 9,000 children - some as young as six - were sent to Australia by British children's homes, supposedly to a better life. Many made the best of it and went on to forge successful careers and have families of their own. Others have had a harder time, often as a result of lasting effects of physical and sexual abuse meted out in some homes. </p> <p>But whatever their experience, all child migrants share, to some extent, a sense of loss of identity. As one former migrant told an inquiry by MPs: \"For the vast majority of child migrants, the most often asked question is: 'Who am I?'\" </p> <p>Following that inquiry, by the Commons health select committee, the government in 1998 urged agencies that had been involved in child migrant schemes to offer assistance to their former charges. It said they should be allowed full access to their files and help should be given to those who wanted to trace their families here in the UK. </p> <p>Some agencies have contracted out this work, but the NCH Action For Children charity decided to appoint Birmingham social worker, Joan Kerry, to set up a family tracing service. She also offers support to those who want to be reunited with family members - in some cases, parents they never knew they had. </p> <p>John Grant had always believed he was rescued as a baby from a house fire in which both his parents had perished. But when Kerry reopened his file, almost 50 years after he was shipped off to Australia, she discovered his parents were still alive and in their 80s. Kerry has just set out on her third and final trip to Australia to meet up with those like Grant - not his real name - to help them piece together their fragmented past. </p> <p>As National Children's Homes, NCH sent 129 children to Australia in the years just before and just after the second world war. </p> <p>\"The fact that the numbers are small has meant it's been a relatively manageable project for me,\" says Kerry. \"I've managed to make contact with 80 of the original 129. Some told me I was half a century too late, but 50 of them have wanted to use the service. I've found out that 14 are dead and eight people are using an independent agency to trace their roots.\" </p> <p>Her youngest client is 56 and the oldest 76. Kerry hires a hotel room to hold interviews and the sessions can be long and, occasionally, harrowing. One man had asked her to find his mother's grave; Kerry later discovered that the woman had died virtually destitute and been buried in an unmarked plot. As is the custom, after 14 years the grave had been re-used and, another 14 years on, a third person was buried there - this time with a headstone. </p> <p>\"On my next visit, I had to tell him what had happened and I took photos,\" Kerry says. \"He was devastated. All his life he had planned to go to the grave and tell his mother all the things he'd stored up over the years.\" </p> <p>Kerry feels very strongly that the sort of sensitive information she is dealing with should be given in person. \"I'm also a bit obsessive about the surroundings where it happens,\" she says. \"For many people, I'm telling them their parents are dead - and anybody who has had that news will know you remember every detail about where you were and how you were told. So you don't want it to be in some bleak office.\" </p> <p>Part of Kerry's brief was to consider what lessons could be learned from the child migration schemes. She believes there are many. </p> <p>\"Lesson one is don't send youngsters 12,000 miles away,\" she insists. \"Yet we're bringing in children from South America and China for adoption and moving kids from Kent to Yorkshire. It's totally contrary to the government's recommendation that children should be able to keep in touch with their birth families.\" </p> <p>There is also the issue of recording family medical history. She says: \"For my clients in Australia, when the doctor asks if there's a history of diabetes or heart problems in the family, they just don't know.\" </p> <p>She has learned that, in care work, it should be essential, for possible future reference, to record information such as the names of aunts and uncles. \"I chair an adoption panel and we still get cases where the file says 'interviewed the grandmother', without giving her name.\" </p> <p>Staff should also be careful what they write in children's notes, she believes. One woman in Australia was very hurt that someone had recorded that she \"tends to be jealous of younger children\". She had been eight when that was written and felt it was unfair. A businessman was upset by a description of him in his notes as \"a deceitful boy\". </p> <p> For some, the files brought good news. One man was thrilled to discover he had the same first name as both his father and grandfather. If he'd known earlier, he'd have kept up the tradition with his own son. </p> <p>Another client discovered the father he thought had abandoned him had in fact sent maintenance money for 12 years until the boy was sent to Australia. The client told Kerry: \"All my life I've damned my father for walking away from me, and it turns out he didn't. Seeing this file has been the most healing thing that's ever happened to me.\" </p> <p>But not everyone felt so positive. One woman who shouted at Kerry had buck teeth as a child and was still angry that nobody at her NCH home had sent her for dental treatment. \"With some of them,\" Kerry says, \"just under the surface is the hurt little girl or boy sent to the other side of the world all those years ago.\" </p> <p>The government has set aside a \u00a31m fund for former child migrants to travel to Britain if they have a close relative here that they have never seen. One man has been over here to meet the brother he had not seen since 1948. Meanwhile, John Grant has been making plans to come and see the parents he never knew he had. Sadly, his father died recently, but Grant is still coming to see his mother. </p> <p>\"I can't help admiring their bravery,\" says Kerry as she prepares for her final trip to Australia. \"I feel my job's nearly done now. I've contacted everyone I can and I've set up a system to deal with any future inquiries. I'm pleased at what we've achieved and I think they have found it useful. This is a very special group of people and, quite honestly, it's been a privilege working with them.\"</p> <p><strong>A passage of time</strong></p> <p> It is not often that an eight-year-old boy asks to be taken into care, but Bill Cunningham did exactly that. After the second world war, he and his mother who was in poor health were struggling to get by in a poor part of Liverpool. His father was dead, there was rarely food on the table and, in his own words, he \"became a bit of an urchin\" . </p> <p>He told the authorities that his mother had suffered a stroke and could not look after him. According to his file, he asked to be taken into care. So he was sent to a then National Children's Home orphanage in Yorkshire. </p> <p>Cunningham spent five happy years at the home, his mother never got in touch and the staff and the other children became his family. But then, shortly after his 13th birthday, he was told he had been \"selected\" to be sent to Australia. \"There were four of us chosen and I remember thinking it might be a bit of an adventure,\" he says. </p> <p>The four joined a party of 40 or so others who, in January 1950, boarded the SS Mooltan at Portsmouth for the long voyage. </p> <p>\"I was transferred to a home on the outskirts of Sydney and there was just no comparison with what we were used to back home,\" says Cunningham. \"It was Methodist-run and very spartan and the first thing we had to learn was how to milk a cow, which was a bit of a culture shock for most of us.\" </p> <p>He left at the first opportunity, when he was 15, and hitched around Australia, drifting in and out of different jobs. \"I never made any secret of my background and you'd find that if anything went missing you'd be the first suspect as you were from a home,\" he says. </p> <p>He finally settled in Melbourne and took on a clerical job. He was good at sport and carried the torch in the 1956 Olympics. </p> <p>In 1960, he married Janet, a local woman, and the couple went on to have seven children. \"Our only sadness was that our youngest daughter died of a heart problem when she was five,\" he says. \"But, all in all, I've had a marvellous life. That's why I was quite aggrieved when the so-called 'scandal' of the child migrants broke. They presented the whole thing as negative, but it wasn't like that for all of us.\" </p> <p>Cunningham has always been anxious not to let his background become an excuse when things have been tough. He says: \"Some people are still bitter about being sent so far from home, but what's the point? My way of dealing with it has always been to be as positive as possible.\" </p> <p>Last year, Joan Kerry took Cunningham his personal file and he asked her to find his mother's grave. At the age of 64, he has just travelled to the Everton district of Liverpool to visit it for the first time. </p> <p>\"Of course I felt very emotional, but seeing the grave and getting a copy of the death certificate makes me feel like I've dealt with some unfinished business,\" he says. \"After a shaky start, I've done OK in life. I did 25 years as a health service manager and brought up a fantastic family. And I'm very proud of my association with NCH. As far as I'm concerned, they've done a good job.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>From an early age, Gurmit Davatwal wanted to be a soldier. Not just any old soldier, but a member of the Household Cavalry. \"My dad was keen on the services and used to take us to Horse Guards Parade,\" he recalls. \"I remember looking at those guards and thinking: 'One day I'll do that'.\" </p> <p>Sadly, his father died when Davatwal was just 16, and never did see his son sitting stock still astride an immaculately groomed horse. That was the young Sikh's only regret as his eyes stared straight ahead, steadfastly ignoring his sister's camera. He was a proud defender of Queen and country and a godsend to an army desperate to boost the number of minority ethnic soldiers in its ranks. </p> <p>Even before he had completed his basic training, Davatwal's friendly face and open manner were being put to good use in recruiting offices. He could charm reporters at press conferences and reassure black and Asian youths that stories about racism were history. No wonder his superiors were impressed. When one asked him where he saw himself in 10 years' time, he replied: \"Hopefully, sir, in your chair.\" The officer looked pleased and said: \"Well done.\" </p> <p>It is difficult to predict where Davatwal, 22, will be in 10 years' time, but right now he is selling sunglasses on commission at Heathrow airport. He was summarily dismissed from the Household Cavalry in March this year after an ill-fated night out in the West End with \"the lads\". </p> <p>Although he is adamant that he has never taken drugs, and that his drink must have been spiked, traces of ecstasy were found in his bloodstream during one of the routine tests at Knightsbridge barracks in London. Ecstasy is an A-class drug and army rules are clear. No arguments. No way back. </p> <p>Six others were caught by the same random test and they, too, were given an administrative discharge. They were all white, so there is no suggestion that the Sikh was treated more harshly than anybody else. All the same, his fall from grace seems particularly poignant in the context of his previous prominent role in army recruitment. </p> <p>\"He contributed a tremendous amount,\" Lieutenant-Colonel Mark Ridley concedes in next week's second programme of Channel 4's series, New Model Army. \"He was a good soldier, quite clearly a future leader. What we owe him is thanks for his enthusiasm, but he did let us down . . . We invested a lot in his training [and] he let himself down.\" </p> <p>More than 10 years have passed since Prince Charles noticed a distinct lack of black or brown faces in the ranks of those guarding his mother, and suggested that something must be done. Pressure built up in the early 1990s, when it emerged that a black mechanic had been refused entry on no other grounds than his colour. </p> <p>Evidence of racist bullying emerged later from some of those black recruits who did make it into the ranks. Small wonder that Bob Purkiss, a commissioner at the Commission for Racial Equality, says of the efforts by the top brass to clean up their act: \"If you can change the Household Cavalry, you can change any regiment in the British army.\" </p> <p>Television producer Roger Mills and his team have spent 18 months recording the effectiveness of the army's 1997 commitment to turn itself into an equal opportunities employer. The Household Cavalry has accounted for the first two of the four-part series. Last week, viewers followed the progress of Marcelous Pusey, an Afro-Caribbean recruit from Birmingham, as he passed through basic training and looked forward to a rewarding career as a guardsman. </p> <p>Yes, he was bawled at by NCOs, but then so was every other recruit. Yes, he put up with a bit of mildly racist banter and shrugged it off. But last December, he felt impelled to put in a complaint to the army's equal opportunities inquiry team. Exactly why is shrouded in mystery because the army has chosen to make it sub-judice. Nearly eight months on, the complaint is still being shunted around in Byzantine complexities of inquiry procedure. No verdict has been forthcoming - a marked contrast with the swiftness with which Davatwal was discharged. </p> <p>Meanwhile, \"Niggers don't belong here\" was found scrawled in the washroom at the Knightsbridge barracks. </p> <p>\"We didn't go looking for racism when we set out on this series - it found us,\" says Mills, 63, who spent nearly two years in the Intelligence Corps during his national service and professes himself to be a \"great lover of the army\" with a fondness for military bands. He was evidently impressed by the commitment of Major-General Evelyn Webb-Carter, commanding officer of the Household Division, and very much one of the old school. \"He has informed himself about ethnic issues and wants this policy of attracting more black and Asian soldiers to succeed,\" Mills says. \"But if there are complaints about racism, they should be dealt with properly.\" </p> <p>Pratap Rughani, who directed next Tuesday's programme about Davatwal, goes further. \"The army top brass are appearing on platforms saying that, if there are problems, they will be dealt with swiftly,\" he says. \"That's not the evidence we have. It's misleading.\" </p> <p>Both programme-makers agree that however much the policy changes at the top, however many equal opportunities lectures are given to the ranks, it will take at least another gen eration for racist attitudes to be squeezed out of the barrack room. And even that's by no means guaranteed. </p> <p>Pusey has another two years to serve. Davatwal has a whole lifetime to contemplate the folly of one night on the town. \"I got up at six the next morning and reported for duty as usual,\" he recalls. \"I couldn't believe it when they told me the result of the drug test. It was as though my heart had been ripped out.\" </p> <p>For a while it had seemed that he had successfully straddled two cultures. The teenage fights he had had defending his mother and sister from racist taunts at home in Slough, Berkshire, had been forgotten when he found himself accepted in the army. \"The officers seemed like father figures if I had a problem, and the NCOs didn't treat me any better or any worse than anyone else,\" he recalls. </p> <p>As for his fellow recruits, he just felt glad to be accepted. He didn't mind being called Poppadum. That was just barrack-room humour, \"a bit of a laugh\". But he did sometimes resent being called away to pose in the recruitment office because he knew somebody else would have to cover for him. That problem was exacerbated when he needed compassionate leave to go looking for his sister, who had rebelled against an arranged marriage and run off with a Muslim. Davatwal found himself facing up to some prejudices of his own. </p> <p>\"I think the lad was under tremendous pressure all round,\" says Mills, sympathetically. In the circumstances, it's hardly surprising, as next Tuesday's programme points out, that he \"tried extra hard to be in with the lads\". Whatever happened on that night out was to cost him his career, the pride first engendered by his father, and acceptance by the national institution that he had come to regard as his second family.</p> <p><strong>The army in transition</strong></p> <p>In common with the other forces, the army is committed to a target that 4% of its recruits should this year come from British black and minority ethnic groups. At present, it is achieving about 3.2%. </p> <p>Last year, the army failed to hit a 3% target, reaching only 2.2%. While that was an improvement on the year before, senior officers are under no illusion about the kind of signal that was sent. \"It was a damaging failure,\" admits Brigadier Sebastian Roberts, the army's director of corporate communications. \"We had been making good progress in shaking off the image of a 'white' organisation.\" </p> <p>Roberts has viewed the Channel 4 series and, overall, is impressed by its balance. In particular, he thinks the Davatwal programme \"one of the best documentaries I have seen for years\". But he is anxious that viewers may rush to judgment on the first part, last week, which he feels presented unfairly the entangled disciplinary issues of the Pusey case. </p> <p>Pusey, stresses Roberts, is a highly valued and contented trooper. Last week, he was on duty at the Queen Mother's 100th birthday celebrations. \"He is loving it, but anybody seeing that first programme may get a misleading impression. I very much hope people will give the whole series a chance ,\" Roberts says. </p> <p>Progress may be slow, but there is change. In the Household Cavalry, there are now two officers and 69 soldiers who are black and Asian. Seven years ago, there were none.</p> <p>\u0095 Part two of New Model Army will be shown next Tuesday on Channel 4 at 9pm.</p>",

      "bodyText": "From an early age, Gurmit Davatwal wanted to be a soldier. Not just any old soldier, but a member of the Household Cavalry. \"My dad was keen on the services and used to take us to Horse Guards Parade,\" he recalls. \"I remember looking at those guards and thinking: 'One day I'll do that'.\" Sadly, his father died when Davatwal was just 16, and never did see his son sitting stock still astride an immaculately groomed horse. That was the young Sikh's only regret as his eyes stared straight ahead, steadfastly ignoring his sister's camera. He was a proud defender of Queen and country and a godsend to an army desperate to boost the number of minority ethnic soldiers in its ranks. Even before he had completed his basic training, Davatwal's friendly face and open manner were being put to good use in recruiting offices. He could charm reporters at press conferences and reassure black and Asian youths that stories about racism were history. No wonder his superiors were impressed. When one asked him where he saw himself in 10 years' time, he replied: \"Hopefully, sir, in your chair.\" The officer looked pleased and said: \"Well done.\" It is difficult to predict where Davatwal, 22, will be in 10 years' time, but right now he is selling sunglasses on commission at Heathrow airport. He was summarily dismissed from the Household Cavalry in March this year after an ill-fated night out in the West End with \"the lads\". Although he is adamant that he has never taken drugs, and that his drink must have been spiked, traces of ecstasy were found in his bloodstream during one of the routine tests at Knightsbridge barracks in London. Ecstasy is an A-class drug and army rules are clear. No arguments. No way back. Six others were caught by the same random test and they, too, were given an administrative discharge. They were all white, so there is no suggestion that the Sikh was treated more harshly than anybody else. All the same, his fall from grace seems particularly poignant in the context of his previous prominent role in army recruitment. \"He contributed a tremendous amount,\" Lieutenant-Colonel Mark Ridley concedes in next week's second programme of Channel 4's series, New Model Army. \"He was a good soldier, quite clearly a future leader. What we owe him is thanks for his enthusiasm, but he did let us down . . . We invested a lot in his training [and] he let himself down.\" More than 10 years have passed since Prince Charles noticed a distinct lack of black or brown faces in the ranks of those guarding his mother, and suggested that something must be done. Pressure built up in the early 1990s, when it emerged that a black mechanic had been refused entry on no other grounds than his colour. Evidence of racist bullying emerged later from some of those black recruits who did make it into the ranks. Small wonder that Bob Purkiss, a commissioner at the Commission for Racial Equality, says of the efforts by the top brass to clean up their act: \"If you can change the Household Cavalry, you can change any regiment in the British army.\" Television producer Roger Mills and his team have spent 18 months recording the effectiveness of the army's 1997 commitment to turn itself into an equal opportunities employer. The Household Cavalry has accounted for the first two of the four-part series. Last week, viewers followed the progress of Marcelous Pusey, an Afro-Caribbean recruit from Birmingham, as he passed through basic training and looked forward to a rewarding career as a guardsman. Yes, he was bawled at by NCOs, but then so was every other recruit. Yes, he put up with a bit of mildly racist banter and shrugged it off. But last December, he felt impelled to put in a complaint to the army's equal opportunities inquiry team. Exactly why is shrouded in mystery because the army has chosen to make it sub-judice. Nearly eight months on, the complaint is still being shunted around in Byzantine complexities of inquiry procedure. No verdict has been forthcoming - a marked contrast with the swiftness with which Davatwal was discharged. Meanwhile, \"Niggers don't belong here\" was found scrawled in the washroom at the Knightsbridge barracks. \"We didn't go looking for racism when we set out on this series - it found us,\" says Mills, 63, who spent nearly two years in the Intelligence Corps during his national service and professes himself to be a \"great lover of the army\" with a fondness for military bands. He was evidently impressed by the commitment of Major-General Evelyn Webb-Carter, commanding officer of the Household Division, and very much one of the old school. \"He has informed himself about ethnic issues and wants this policy of attracting more black and Asian soldiers to succeed,\" Mills says. \"But if there are complaints about racism, they should be dealt with properly.\" Pratap Rughani, who directed next Tuesday's programme about Davatwal, goes further. \"The army top brass are appearing on platforms saying that, if there are problems, they will be dealt with swiftly,\" he says. \"That's not the evidence we have. It's misleading.\" Both programme-makers agree that however much the policy changes at the top, however many equal opportunities lectures are given to the ranks, it will take at least another gen eration for racist attitudes to be squeezed out of the barrack room. And even that's by no means guaranteed. Pusey has another two years to serve. Davatwal has a whole lifetime to contemplate the folly of one night on the town. \"I got up at six the next morning and reported for duty as usual,\" he recalls. \"I couldn't believe it when they told me the result of the drug test. It was as though my heart had been ripped out.\" For a while it had seemed that he had successfully straddled two cultures. The teenage fights he had had defending his mother and sister from racist taunts at home in Slough, Berkshire, had been forgotten when he found himself accepted in the army. \"The officers seemed like father figures if I had a problem, and the NCOs didn't treat me any better or any worse than anyone else,\" he recalls. As for his fellow recruits, he just felt glad to be accepted. He didn't mind being called Poppadum. That was just barrack-room humour, \"a bit of a laugh\". But he did sometimes resent being called away to pose in the recruitment office because he knew somebody else would have to cover for him. That problem was exacerbated when he needed compassionate leave to go looking for his sister, who had rebelled against an arranged marriage and run off with a Muslim. Davatwal found himself facing up to some prejudices of his own. \"I think the lad was under tremendous pressure all round,\" says Mills, sympathetically. In the circumstances, it's hardly surprising, as next Tuesday's programme points out, that he \"tried extra hard to be in with the lads\". Whatever happened on that night out was to cost him his career, the pride first engendered by his father, and acceptance by the national institution that he had come to regard as his second family. The army in transition In common with the other forces, the army is committed to a target that 4% of its recruits should this year come from British black and minority ethnic groups. At present, it is achieving about 3.2%. Last year, the army failed to hit a 3% target, reaching only 2.2%. While that was an improvement on the year before, senior officers are under no illusion about the kind of signal that was sent. \"It was a damaging failure,\" admits Brigadier Sebastian Roberts, the army's director of corporate communications. \"We had been making good progress in shaking off the image of a 'white' organisation.\" Roberts has viewed the Channel 4 series and, overall, is impressed by its balance. In particular, he thinks the Davatwal programme \"one of the best documentaries I have seen for years\". But he is anxious that viewers may rush to judgment on the first part, last week, which he feels presented unfairly the entangled disciplinary issues of the Pusey case. Pusey, stresses Roberts, is a highly valued and contented trooper. Last week, he was on duty at the Queen Mother's 100th birthday celebrations. \"He is loving it, but anybody seeing that first programme may get a misleading impression. I very much hope people will give the whole series a chance ,\" Roberts says. Progress may be slow, but there is change. In the Household Cavalry, there are now two officers and 69 soldiers who are black and Asian. Seven years ago, there were none. \u0095 Part two of New Model Army will be shown next Tuesday on Channel 4 at 9pm.",

Leaders of Moscow's large Chechen community were bracing themselves for a wave of repressive actions, including summary police searches, interrogations, detentions, and expulsions from the area, after the city's powerful mayor, Yuriy Luzhkov, declared the bomb \"100 per cent Chechen.\" The head mufti of Russia, leader of the country's large Muslim community, Sheikh Ravil Galautdin, warned that incendiary public statements blaming Chechens for the crime could spark \"nationalist feuds\" in the country.

Following yesterday's bomb, Russian police have found a bag containing explosives at the city's Kazansky railway station this morning. Officers found a suitcase containing 4kg (almost nine pounds) of TNT and seven detonators in a lost luggage office at the station. The explosives were not wired for detonation, but police are investigating a possible link to Tuesday's blast. A wave of bombings that left 300 people dead a year ago was blamed on Chechen rebels, triggering Mr Putin's decision to launch the war in the north Caucasus against Chechen separatists. Now Moscow residents are worrying that the city faces a new terror campaign. The find came after Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov had denied that his separatist fighters were behind yesterday's attack. The denial was made in a statement by Mr Maskhadov on the Chechen press agency's website. The agency claims to be the official voice of Mr Maskhadov, who is believed to be in the southern Chechen mountains. \"The press service of the president of the Chechen republic of Ichkeria is empowered to declare that attempts by the Russian side to blame the terrorist act in Pushkin Square on Chechen resistance fighters has no foundation,\" the statement said.

A spokeswoman for Diageo refused to confirm this but said: \"We're not hiding the fact that we're interested in Seagram's spirits business and we have said we're looking at all options.\" </p> <p>Diageo is the world's biggest drinks company and insiders say the group is anxious to prevent Allied Domecq, its nearest rival, from growing in scale. </p> <p>However, Diageo is unlikely to bid alone for regulatory reasons as it would not be allowed to add Seagram's Chivas Regal premium whisky to its own Johnnie Walker. </p> <p>Diageo already has a good relationship with Bacardi, which bought its Dewar's whisky and Bombay gin brand two years ago. </p> <p>Under a joint purchase, Diageo is tipped to pick up Seagram's Captain Morgan rum and Crown Royal whisky. An imminent move is unlikely, however, as both Diageo's chief executive John McGrath and his designated successor, Paul Walsh, are on holiday. </p> <p>The group will have money to spend after the sale of Pillsbury, its US food business, and the partial flotation of its fast food chain Burger King. Mr Walsh, who takes over the top job next month, needs a plan to win over sceptical investors, who doubt the growth prospects of Diageo's remaining UDV spirits arm and Guinness beer company. </p> <p>Seagram declined to comment yesterday. Its drinks operations employ 10,000 people in 190 countries, with sales last year of $684m. It wants to exit the industry following its decision to merge with Vivendi, the French media giant. </p> <p>Allied Domecq's new chief executive Philip Bowman is anxious to make a big acquisition, following the group's \u00a32.7bn sale of its pub estate last year.

      "bodyText": "Diageo and Allied Domecq look set for a head-on clash in the battle to buy Seagram's $7bn (\u00a34.5bn) wine and spirits business, which is up for sale after the Canadian group's decision to concentrate on media and entertainment. Industry sources yesterday said Diageo was discussing a joint bid for the business with Bacardi, the Bermudan-based drinks group. A spokeswoman for Diageo refused to confirm this but said: \"We're not hiding the fact that we're interested in Seagram's spirits business and we have said we're looking at all options.\" Diageo is the world's biggest drinks company and insiders say the group is anxious to prevent Allied Domecq, its nearest rival, from growing in scale. However, Diageo is unlikely to bid alone for regulatory reasons as it would not be allowed to add Seagram's Chivas Regal premium whisky to its own Johnnie Walker. Diageo already has a good relationship with Bacardi, which bought its Dewar's whisky and Bombay gin brand two years ago. Under a joint purchase, Diageo is tipped to pick up Seagram's Captain Morgan rum and Crown Royal whisky. An imminent move is unlikely, however, as both Diageo's chief executive John McGrath and his designated successor, Paul Walsh, are on holiday. The group will have money to spend after the sale of Pillsbury, its US food business, and the partial flotation of its fast food chain Burger King. Mr Walsh, who takes over the top job next month, needs a plan to win over sceptical investors, who doubt the growth prospects of Diageo's remaining UDV spirits arm and Guinness beer company. Seagram declined to comment yesterday. Its drinks operations employ 10,000 people in 190 countries, with sales last year of $684m. It wants to exit the industry following its decision to merge with Vivendi, the French media giant. Allied Domecq's new chief executive Philip Bowman is anxious to make a big acquisition, following the group's \u00a32.7bn sale of its pub estate last year. Analysts believe its portfolio would fit well with Seagram's, with the only obvious overlaps in cognac where Allied's Courvoisier competes with Seagram's Martell, and in a handful of port and sherry brands. Several other contenders are considering entering the fray, including the Bronfman family who founded Seagram 76 years ago and still have a 24% stake. Charles Bronfman, co-chairman of Seagram, is believed to have appointed the US investment bank Bear Stearns to help prepare a multi-billion dollar buyout proposal. Paris-based Pernod Ricard has been tipped as another bidder, although it has been hampered by its failure to off load its Orangina soft drinks operation. The French government blocked a sale of the business to Coca-Cola last year. Diageo's shares slipped 4.5p to 600p yesterday, while Allied Domecq edged up 1.75p to 339.75p. Morgan Stanley, which is advising Seagram on the sale, is due to publish a book with details of the up-for-grabs operations later this month.

      "body": "<p>Police today called for an end to mob violence against suspected sex offenders as four families in Portsmouth left their homes after a series of anti-paedophile riots.</p> <p>The families who left were not connected to paedophiles or sex offenders but had chosen to leave the city's troubled Paulsgrove estate, where the riots were centred, because they did not like what was happening, said Hampshire Police spokesman Richard Horobin.</p> <p>There have been violent demonstrations on the estate since last Thursday, when a policeman was injured and a car was torched by a mob.</p> <p>That protest targeted a convicted paedophile who was \"named and shamed\" in the News of the World. He had now left the county, police said.</p> <p>Mr Horobin said another family targeted by the mob had since left the estate but refused to confirm reports that protesters were working from a list of 20 suspected sex offenders.</p> <p>Portsmouth City Council has said it will offer temporary accommodation to any individuals or families named by the protesters, and has asked for the list to be handed over. It has agreed a five-point \"peace plan\" with police and protest leaders and has said it is talking to two families about rehousing them.</p> <p>Acting chief executive Roger Ching said: \"We can only look to offer people a temporary change of address with their agreement.</p> <p>\"If they do not want to go, there is nothing we can do about it - and that was the biggest bone of contention with the protesters, although they now understand the reasons for that.\"</p> <p>Mr Ching said talks between the council, police and the protesters had been productive, adding: \"The bottom line is that they share our view in not wanting to see any more violence on the streets of Paulsgrove and we will all work full speed to achieve that aim.\"</p> <p>The five points of the plan are: \u0095 All sides agreeing to work for the safety of children and public safety on the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth <br> \u0095 Regular meetings with protest leaders <br> \u0095 A council-appointed liaison officer will work with residents <br> \u0095 The council pledges to help residents campaign for a change in the law about the release of paedophiles into the community <br> \u0095: Protesters will consider handing over their list of alleged paedophiles. The council will then offer anyone on the list who is under threat a temporary \"place of safety\".</p> <p>Police said an anti-paedophile demonstration was scheduled to take place in Paulsgrove Park this morning.

      "bodyText": "Police today called for an end to mob violence against suspected sex offenders as four families in Portsmouth left their homes after a series of anti-paedophile riots. The families who left were not connected to paedophiles or sex offenders but had chosen to leave the city's troubled Paulsgrove estate, where the riots were centred, because they did not like what was happening, said Hampshire Police spokesman Richard Horobin. There have been violent demonstrations on the estate since last Thursday, when a policeman was injured and a car was torched by a mob. That protest targeted a convicted paedophile who was \"named and shamed\" in the News of the World. He had now left the county, police said. Mr Horobin said another family targeted by the mob had since left the estate but refused to confirm reports that protesters were working from a list of 20 suspected sex offenders. Portsmouth City Council has said it will offer temporary accommodation to any individuals or families named by the protesters, and has asked for the list to be handed over. It has agreed a five-point \"peace plan\" with police and protest leaders and has said it is talking to two families about rehousing them. Acting chief executive Roger Ching said: \"We can only look to offer people a temporary change of address with their agreement. \"If they do not want to go, there is nothing we can do about it - and that was the biggest bone of contention with the protesters, although they now understand the reasons for that.\" Mr Ching said talks between the council, police and the protesters had been productive, adding: \"The bottom line is that they share our view in not wanting to see any more violence on the streets of Paulsgrove and we will all work full speed to achieve that aim.\" The five points of the plan are: \u0095 All sides agreeing to work for the safety of children and public safety on the Paulsgrove estate in Portsmouth \u0095 Regular meetings with protest leaders \u0095 A council-appointed liaison officer will work with residents \u0095 The council pledges to help residents campaign for a change in the law about the release of paedophiles into the community \u0095: Protesters will consider handing over their list of alleged paedophiles. The council will then offer anyone on the list who is under threat a temporary \"place of safety\". Police said an anti-paedophile demonstration was scheduled to take place in Paulsgrove Park this morning. There was another protest last night, with more than 100 demonstrators marching through the estate, but it was peaceful with no arrests, police said. In Plymouth, meanwhile, police today called for an end to vigilante action after 50-60 people targeted the home of a suspected sex offender in the Southway area of the city yesterday evening. The house, which is believed to be the home of a registered sex offender, has been the subject of several recent community meetings. The crowd, which included many children, chanted \"we want you out\" and threw a stone through the window of the house, said a police spokesman. No-one inside was injured, but police were called by neighbours who were concerned for their own safety. Officers dispersed the crowd within 30 minutes, but felt it was necessary to maintain a visible presence at the house through the night. Some protesters had vowed to return night after night until the man left the area, the police spokesman said. Officers were today planning to meet local people to discuss the best plan of action, while ward officers would also be out in the community. Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman John Wood urged people not to resort to vigilante action, saying: \"A great deal of work is being done nationally and locally by all the agencies to review the procedures we have. \"What we are doing is working, and there is a great danger that if these procedures break down sex offenders will be driven underground. \"Then we will lose the vital contact we have with them now and children will be less safe.\"",

Although the bodies were discovered on 19 June, only two have been positively identified. Relatives of the victims have been reluctant to come forward because of their own uncertain legal status in Britain. Chinese groups have been pressing the Kent police to release the photos of the victims to them as a way of getting around this problem. When the proposal first emerged, the police said that the time was not ripe, but the Dover police appear to have shifted their position since another request was made last week. Kent police are expected to make a final decision in a few days. \"We have requested the photos to be released and we received a sympathetic response. We are waiting to hear from the chief constable,\" said Jabez Lam, chairman of the of Dover 58 co-ordinating committee, which was formed two weeks ago. Twenty of the victims are believed to have relatives in Britain, but Mr Lam believes that the initial police approach to the tragedy scared off family members. Kent police at first wanted the relatives to declare their own immigration status and to give information about the victims' routes. Kent police have since completely separated the criminal investigation and the identification process. Families who come forward will neither be asked about their immigration status nor will they be asked about details of how their relatives reached Britain. But it been difficult to dispel the initial fears of the relatives says Mr Lam. The co-ordinating committee proposed that the police release the photos to a small group within the Chinese community with proper procedures to verify that those who come forward are genuine family members. The committee has authorised the Central London law centre in Soho and the Monitoring Group, which monitors race crimes, to hold the photos in their safekeeping during the identification process. Mark Pugash, a spokesman from the Kent police, played down Chinese concerns over the identification process. He said the police had received a great deal of cooperation from the Chinese government and the Chinese community in Britain. \"We are pretty confident we know who 46 of the people are,\" Mr Pugash said. But there have been reports that cooperation between British and Chinese police has been less than smooth. British DNA specialists postponed a trip to China amid reports of Chinese displeasure that Chinese officials would not be given access to the two survivors from the ill-fated lorry. The British specialists are expected to go Fujian province, where the victims came from, at the end of the month or early next month after the Chinese have finished the preliminary work on DNA samples. Three people have been charged with manslaughter in connection with the tragedy, a man and woman of Chinese origin, and the driver of the lorry. The 58 bodies, four of them women, were found in a refrigeration container that had arrived by ferry from Zeebrugge. Home Office pathologists, who completed post mortem examinations on the bodies, confirmed that all 58 had died of suffocation. The number of Chinese asylum seekers coming to Britain is second only to those from Sri Lanka, with 400 Chinese asylum seekers arriving every month. But the refusal of the Beijing government to take back Chinese nationals who have destroyed their documents has blocked attempts by the immigration authorities to remove hundreds of failed Chinese asylum seekers from Britain.",

That, Mr Hague claimed, led to him drinking up to 10 pints of John Smith's bitter during the day - and four more in the evening when he went out socialising. \"Anyone who thinks I used to spend my holidays reading political tracts should have come with me for a week,\" he said. Quite what voters will make of the contesting claims of politicians to have drinking pasts is unclear. So far, the Liberal Democrats - whose leader Charles Kennedy is an enthusiast for the whisky that is produced in his West Highlands constituency - have stayed out of the fray. The party's deputy leader, Alan Beith, looks unlikely to join in. He, at least, is teetotal.",

      "body": "<p>Just this once, believe the hype. Big Brother was billed as the summer's monster hit, and it is. Part gameshow, part docusoap, the Channel 4 programme has not just edged in front of BBC1 in the ratings. It has pulled off a trick thought possible only in television's golden past - creating a shared, collective experience. Sixteen years after 1984, Britain can declare: \"Big Brother, we're watching you.\" </p> <p>The programme has become what American TV execs call \"water-cooler television\", a show that buzzes into office chat the next day. The premise could not be simpler: 10 strangers share a specially equipped house, remote-control cameras filming their every move. Each week they nominate two people for eviction; viewers vote on which one should leave, until only the winner is left - \u00a370,000 richer. </p> <p>That formula has already brought the show no fewer than three of the platinum hallmarks of modern success. First, its subjects have gained one-word name-recognition. Like Madonna and Elvis, we now have Sada and Nick - no surnames necessary. </p> <p>Second, the show has spawned its very own tabloid campaign. While the News of the World was naming and shaming paedophiles, the Sun got busy exposing stockbroker Nick for his Iago-like manipulation of his housemates. The viewers have seen it all, but the contestants have remained horribly deceived: hence the Sun's attempt to airdrop Kick Out Nick leaflets into the Big Brother garden. Photographers have taken to firing tennis balls into the compound marked \"Nick lies\". </p> <p>The third proof of the show's success has come in the form of that greatest of compliments: parody. Click on to the Labour party's website and you can visit the Tory house of horrors, where \"Ten Tories have all been forced to share a political home together, but as months go by the tension is rising and cracks are beginning to show.\" William Hague is blamed for creating an \"atmosphere of intolerance\" in the house, while Ann Widdecombe is \"the scary one\". Your chance to vote on this lot won't come until next spring at the earliest. </p> <p>The appeal of the show is not mysterious. The contestants are young and attractive, and they have so far complied with the rules of good narrative. We have had a hint of romance, courtesy of the (now-evicted) Andrew and Mel, and a pantomime villain in Nick. Thanks to the editing nous of the Big Brother controllers, we only get to see the best bits: the rows, the whispered bitching, the flirtations. </p> <p>But there is a darker edge to the show's appeal, too - for there is something of the prison drama about Big Brother. We watch people bored rigid, denied the basics of human life: work, the company of loved ones, the stimulation of radio, television or newspapers. We wonder which one will crack first - who might be granted early release and who might try to escape. We see the inmates squabble and barter over supplies, reduced to regarding a Snickers bar as a valuable unit of currency. This is The Shawshank Redemption on closed-circuit TV. </p> <p>But the real interest of the show is not them - it's us. Big Brother is exposing the watched, but it's also revealing a fair bit about the watchers. For one thing, we seem to have a collective sadistic streak. The housemates twice voted to kick Caroline out because she irritated them so much; the audience twice voted to keep her in - for much the same reason. She sparked conflict and that made good, gladiatorial television. When the audience saw the first glimmers of romance between Andy and Mel, they instantly moved to stamp it out, by giving him the boot. If Big Brother is a one-way mirror on the nation, it is not making us look good. </p> <p>The success of the show also suggests we like power. In this internet era, the cybergurus bang on endlessly about interactivity: now Big Brother has vindicated them. The key difference between this show and its obvious 1990s precursors, MTV's The Real World and the BBC's Living Soap, is viewer-power. Those programmes also cooped up gangs of young strangers and hoped for fireworks. But where they cast the audience as passive viewers, Big Brother makes a different promise: \"Ten people, one winner - you decide.\" People no longer defer to politicians and they don't want to defer to television programmers. Big Brother lets them believe they are in control. </p> <p> The programme also confirms our current penchant for reality that feels like drama, and for drama that comes with an icing of reality. Big Brother is riding a trend that saw BBC2 launch Tinsel Town on Monday night, a drama filmed in the style of This Life - to look like a documentary. Meanwhile, a real documentary, this year's Oscar-winner One Day in September, is shot like a thriller. The genres are merging. </p> <p>Which brings us to perhaps the most significant revelation the programme has yet provided - beyond Nick's perfidy or Nichola's bottom. It is the extent to which the line between private and public has been erased. Now we make a national pastime of what would once have been a furtive activity: spying on others. We pry into their lives and they are only too willing to show us. The Big Brother housemates cavort in skimpy shorts and bare chests, as if marooned on a Caribbean island, rather than sharing the same dismal weather as the rest of us - and they are happy to do it.</p> <p> Indeed, it is clear that exposure is not the price of taking part, it is the reason. A majority of the contestants want jobs on TV or in the media and regard this shot of exhibitionist celebrity as their big break: the lure is certainly not the \u00a370,000, which, in game-show terms, is small change, a routine prize on the last big TV thing, Who Wants to be a Millionaire? </p> <p>In this, Big Brother is utterly a product of its time. We have got used to men and women making public what were once private emotions (think of the vogue for confessional columnists) and this lot are merely getting in on the act. It's striking that not a single minute of Big Brother has shown a discussion of what we used to call public affairs: there is not a word about politics. It is all about relationships - with each other, past loves or themselves. </p> <p>We are not that different. We too are filmed constantly, by a CCTV presence that makes us the most watched-over society in the world, with cameras in every bank, every shop, every street corner. Thanks to new technology, we too perform for the camera, whether it's a home video or a webcam. We are slowly abolishing privacy as we used to understand it, replacing it with an acceptance that what was once hidden will now be on display - what was once on the inside will now be on show. We watch and we are watched. Maybe that was the twist George Orwell never imagined: we are Big Brother. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com\"> jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com </a></p>",

      "body": "<p>American Beauty director <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Mendes,+Sam\">Sam Mendes</a> is to make his return to film-making with a dark thriller set in the 1930s and starring Tom Hanks. </p> <p>The Road to Perdition will be backed by DreamWorks from a script by David Self (who, rather ominously, wrote the garbled adaptation of The Haunting). According to the <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/frontpage/index.asp#5\">Hollywood Reporter</a>, the film should begin shooting early next year.</p> <p>After winning his Best Director Oscar for American Beauty, the 34-year-old Mendes appeared in no hurry to cash in on his Hollywood success, instead returning to theatre directing in his native London. </p> <p>But observers felt that it was only a matter of time before he was lured back to big-budget film-making. The presence of <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Hanks,+Tom\">Hanks</a> - who allegedly commands a fee of $20m per movie - ensures that The Road to Perdition will be a costly production.</p> <p>The film's story is taken from a long-running DC comic book written by Max Collins and illustrated by Richard Piers Rayner. Perdition plays out in Depression-era Chicago and focuses on a hitman named Michael O'Sullivan (aka the Angel of Death) who juggles career brutality with a loving home life. But when his family are slaughtered by a local crime cartel, O'Sullivan (and his surviving son) plot revenge. A spokesman for Mendes claimed that the film described it as \"an epic that will move from 1930s Chicago to the Badlands of North Dakota, and Tom is going to be playing a very different role to his normal ones\".</p> <p>At first glance Hanks certainly looks a strange choice to play the complex O'Sullivan (one assumes American Beauty star Kevin Spacey would have been more appropriate). But the actor has reportedly been keen to take on more edgy and challenging roles, and the presence of the Oscar-winning Mendes behind the camera will surely have reassured him. </p> <p>For DreamWorks, the production provides the dream team of a hot young director and an established, bankable star. Still months away from shooting, the film's critical and commercial success appears already guaranteed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "American Beauty director Sam Mendes is to make his return to film-making with a dark thriller set in the 1930s and starring Tom Hanks. The Road to Perdition will be backed by DreamWorks from a script by David Self (who, rather ominously, wrote the garbled adaptation of The Haunting). According to the Hollywood Reporter, the film should begin shooting early next year. After winning his Best Director Oscar for American Beauty, the 34-year-old Mendes appeared in no hurry to cash in on his Hollywood success, instead returning to theatre directing in his native London. But observers felt that it was only a matter of time before he was lured back to big-budget film-making. The presence of Hanks - who allegedly commands a fee of $20m per movie - ensures that The Road to Perdition will be a costly production. The film's story is taken from a long-running DC comic book written by Max Collins and illustrated by Richard Piers Rayner. Perdition plays out in Depression-era Chicago and focuses on a hitman named Michael O'Sullivan (aka the Angel of Death) who juggles career brutality with a loving home life. But when his family are slaughtered by a local crime cartel, O'Sullivan (and his surviving son) plot revenge. A spokesman for Mendes claimed that the film described it as \"an epic that will move from 1930s Chicago to the Badlands of North Dakota, and Tom is going to be playing a very different role to his normal ones\". At first glance Hanks certainly looks a strange choice to play the complex O'Sullivan (one assumes American Beauty star Kevin Spacey would have been more appropriate). But the actor has reportedly been keen to take on more edgy and challenging roles, and the presence of the Oscar-winning Mendes behind the camera will surely have reassured him. For DreamWorks, the production provides the dream team of a hot young director and an established, bankable star. Still months away from shooting, the film's critical and commercial success appears already guaranteed.",

By those standards, the press conference to plug his new TV series was restrained. Not that Cameron was actually there.

Steven Bochco is struggling, Kevin Williamson's aura vanished when Wasteland flopped, and The X Files's Chris Carter came a cropper with last year's Harsh Realm, a doomy piece of sci-fi whose obvious reference points - Blade Runner and The Matrix - and ominous title make it hard to distinguish from Dark Angel. So while Cameron's name helped get Dark Angel commissioned, it might not be much use keeping it on air. These days, TV executives treat expensive new fiction suspiciously; what they are all chasing are proven formats from abroad using real people, the next Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? or Big Brother. </p> <p>Cameron's working methods are not best suited to TV either. He acknowledges as much: \"I'll admit that it's definitely a learning curve for me. It really reminds me of my roots as a guerrilla filmmaker.\" Compared to movies, TV shows are banged out on a production line. And after Terminator, Cameron lost the will to do anything quickly. He almost takes pride in the way his movies are always late and more expensive than planned. \"Nobody ever walked out of a theatre saying, 'That movie sucked but, boy, they brought it in on time and on budget!'\" he once argued. When actor Tom Arnold complained about Cameron's perfectionism, he replied \"No, I'm a greatist. I only want to do it until it's great.\" It is an approach that takes its toll. Actor Bill Paxton, a friend of Cameron's, conceded that there were a lot of unhappy people working on Titanic. \"Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win the hearts and minds of people. You gotta keep up with Jim. He's not going to keep up with you.\" The Screen Actors Guild sent a team to investigate how their members were being treated on the set of Titanic, after reports of extraordinarily long working days and actors being pummelled by powerful, crashing water for hours on end. \"It's closer to manual labour than shooting a film\", Leonardo DiCaprio said. Even Kate Winslet rebelled publicly. </p> <p>Nor was Titanic unusual: the Terminator 2 crew wore T-shirts saying \"T3 - not with me\".

Terminator producer Gale Ann Hurd, Point Break director Kathryn Bigelow and Terminator star Linda Hamilton were wives two, three and four respectively. He is now onto number five. </p> <p>So even if Dark Angel is a success, you can be assured that success will have been painfully won. But just waiting for the reaction to the first review should be entertaining enough. Mr Cameron has little time for critics. When Kenneth Turan of the LA Times took a stand in the face of the massive Titanic hype - fuelled by the Murdoch media - Cameron announced that he should be \"impeached\".

The bodies of two men were spotted by police officers from a helicopter as they searched the East Sussex coastline for a missing man believed to be suicidal. One body was found at the foot of the cliffs and another was seen on a jagged cliff ledge a few seconds later. The discovery came five days after another two bodies were found in similar circumstances. Meanwhile, a fifth man escaped serious injury yesterday after falling from Beachy Head and landing in gorse bushes on a grassy ledge part way down the cliff face. Coastguards who helped to rescue the man, in his 30s, described how he lit a cigarette on the ledge as he waited to be winched to safety. The helicopter crew were called out five hours after completing the earlier recovery of the two other bodies from the base of the cliff. A spokesman for the crew, which hovered above the injured man, said: \"We coordinated the rescue and spoke to him through a loud-hailer. \"We were trying to reassure him as he appeared quite agitated, and we were worried about how close to the edge he was.\" Inspector Mark Powles of Sussex police said of the number of deaths at Beachy Head: \"One a month is the usual, but to have so many in such a short space of time is remarkable.\" The bodies found yesterday were taken to a hospital mortuary where a postmortem examination was due to be carried out last night.

      "body": "<p>South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, is to lobby Tony Blair to \"honour Britain's obligations\" and fund the rapidly expanding land seizures in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>A summit of 11 southern African leaders has handed Robert Mugabe a diplomatic victory by appointing Mr Mbeki and Malawi's president, Bakili Muluzi, to put pressure on Britain after backing unequivocally the Zimbabwean leader's policy of expropriating white-owned land for redistribution to poor blacks.</p> <p>The regional presidents said in a statement: \"We are convinced that to have a land reform programme which is fair and just to all the stakeholders it is imperative for the UK government to honour its obligations under the Lancaster House agreement to provide resources for that purpose.</p> <p>\"We reiterate our acceptance of the urgent need to effect land redistribution in Zimbabwe to address land hunger and poverty affecting millions of black Zimbabweans.\"</p> <p>Mr Mugabe argues that Margaret Thatcher's government agreed to fund land reform as part of the Lancaster House settlement which ended minority rule in Zimbabwe 20 years ago.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe's spokesman, George Charamba, yesterday urged London to \"open a new chapter\" in relations with its former colony. \"The British have acted irresponsibly. They still have a colonial mind,\" he said.</p> <p>South African diplomatic sources said it was likely Mr Mbeki would seek a meeting with Mr Blair on the issue.

      "bodyText": "South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, is to lobby Tony Blair to \"honour Britain's obligations\" and fund the rapidly expanding land seizures in Zimbabwe. A summit of 11 southern African leaders has handed Robert Mugabe a diplomatic victory by appointing Mr Mbeki and Malawi's president, Bakili Muluzi, to put pressure on Britain after backing unequivocally the Zimbabwean leader's policy of expropriating white-owned land for redistribution to poor blacks. The regional presidents said in a statement: \"We are convinced that to have a land reform programme which is fair and just to all the stakeholders it is imperative for the UK government to honour its obligations under the Lancaster House agreement to provide resources for that purpose. \"We reiterate our acceptance of the urgent need to effect land redistribution in Zimbabwe to address land hunger and poverty affecting millions of black Zimbabweans.\" Mr Mugabe argues that Margaret Thatcher's government agreed to fund land reform as part of the Lancaster House settlement which ended minority rule in Zimbabwe 20 years ago. Mr Mugabe's spokesman, George Charamba, yesterday urged London to \"open a new chapter\" in relations with its former colony. \"The British have acted irresponsibly. They still have a colonial mind,\" he said. South African diplomatic sources said it was likely Mr Mbeki would seek a meeting with Mr Blair on the issue. The South African president has already made clear his belief that Britain should fund the land acquisitions but he has also called on Mr Mugabe to adhere to the rule of law. Britain has said it will unfreeze a \u00a336m donation to help pay for land redistribution but only once the illegal and sometimes violent occupation of white-owned farms by the self-styled \"war veterans\" is ended. The minister for Africa, Peter Hain, said in June that the government would not write \"a blank cheque\" to Zimbabwe. The land seizures have continued with the government bussing hundreds of families on to farms served with confiscation orders in recent days and fresh invasions of other land by the veterans. Mr Mugabe says he plans to move 500,000 families on to more than 3,000 expropriated farms, about two-thirds of all the white-owned commercial land. Despite the impact of Zimbabwe's deepening economic woes on its neighbours, some of which have seen their currencies dragged down by the crisis, southern African leaders left no doubt where they stand. They welcomed Mr Mugabe's assurance that the land reform programme would be \"handled peacefully, and within the provisions of the laws of Zimbabwe\", but made no reference to the war veterans' violence or the failure to obey court orders to stop the illegal land seizures. Zimbabwe's foreign minister, Stan Mudenge, hailed re gional support for Mr Mugabe's position as unqualified. \"It was full backing for the need for land reform,\" he said. The southern African presidents also praised Zimbabwe's parliamentary election in June for being held \"in a transparent, peaceful, free and fair environment\", without noting the political violence that cost 31 lives and other intimidation highlighted by the European Union and other monitors. If Zimbabwe had a problem, they said, it was that the foreign press had misrepresented Mr Mugabe's policies. \"We are disappointed by the partisan and biased manner in which a sector of the international media has misrepresented the land policy of the government of Zimbabwe which seeks to effect a just and equitable redistribution of land in a situation where 1% of the population owns over 70% of the best arable land,\" they said. The summit called on the US Congress to drop the proposed Zimbabwe democracy act which would impose financial sanctions on Mr Mugabe's administration because of the \"violence, intimidation and killings orchestrated and supported by the government\". The leaders said: \"This punitive piece of legislation is counterproductive and unjust because it will have far-reaching negative implications for the economic development and evolution of democratic institutions in Zimbabwe in particular and the region in general.\" But Mr Mugabe received a fresh reminder of the cost of his policies yesterday when South Africa's electricity generator, Eskom, warned that it might cut supplies to Zimbabwe because of 140m rand (\u00a314m) in unpaid bills. Harare is heavily reliant on South Africa for electricity. Eskom's transmission manager in Johannesburg, Peter O'Connor, said supplies to Zimbabwe were now limited to a third of what had been previously provided. The South African government has been reluctant to call in Zimbabwe's debt to state-run Eskom and is seeking other means of settling the bill, such as taking power stations in payment when Harare privatises its electricity supply.",

      "byline": "Vicki Woods",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Ooh, fabulous - not just one mingy holiday pic, but a whole scrapbook: Tony and the baby, the family and the baby (standing), the family and the baby (sitting), Kathryn and the baby, Kathryn and the baby's hat. Did they rehearse in front of a mirror? No, no, perish the thought. Anyway, you can't rehearse a three-month-old.</p> <p>I think we like Kathryn and the baby's hat best, don't we? Sooooo adorable. The artless little fanned toes, the toy bee waiting to be placed in the fat fist, the careful placement of the hatstrings over the cute chinless neck.</p> <p>No - wait, it's got to be the family and the baby (standing), with Tony on the left and Nicky on the right. That's my favourite. Best view of the clothes. Tony's dazzling white linen shirt (very Calvin), slightly transparent in the Tuscan sunshine (very moderne ), and layered over a slate-blue smart casual trouser (very natty). Great wardrobe call, Tony! And Cherie's come up trumps, too, hasn't she? She's had her difficulties with clothes, believe me, but this black outfit looks perfectly suitable.</p> <p>Black smoothes out any post-partum bulges, and a generous V-neck is always flattering to the fuller figure. I wish she'd stop wearing those odd bits of silver jewellery, though. You get too old for silver. She should mark the words of the Queen's frockmaker, the eternally elegant and tasteful Sir Hardy Amies, who knows a thing or two about dressing top people for photocalls: \"Silver belongs on the dining-table, not around the neck.\" It's time to go with gold, Cherie! Everybody knows the 80s are back.</p> <p>Kathryn and Nicky both look properly formal, with their washed hair, long trousers and freshly-laundered tops. I think you have to nod towards formal when you're staying with a prince, don't you? Is it a prince, or a count? Strozzo-Garozzo or something. Anyway, I bet he dresses to die for, like all Italian men. Nicky's even put a shirt on, bless him. Most 14-year-olds don't even own one. Euan's T-shirt is a bit of a let-down, but what I say is, the lad at least turned up. Did his bit for Dad. Faced the flashbulbs. Can't ask for more.</p> <p>The standing picture also offers the best view of the interesting family relationships. Leo is the only Blair who looks both unembarrassed and untroubled. Tony is the only Blair looking at the camera, which tells you something, doesn't it? Everyone else is looking at Leo (and I don't blame them), except for Euan who is looking at the sort of bottomless black hole that only a 16-year-old who hates life, hates his godawful parents and didn't bloody ask to live in bloody Downing Street, can stare into. Nicky is the only Blair who doesn't know what to do with his hands. Kathryn is the only Blair who seems prepared to link arms with Tony this year: the Blair arm-linking pictures having been such a feature of their previous holiday snaps. Everyone else is staying well clear of Tony. But then - he's got his hands full, of course.</p> <p>I once read that you can calm an angry man by showing him a picture of a woman in a bikini. It works; I tried it. Angry women are not calmed by pictures of bikinis, though. You need to show them cute little babes-in-arms: Ten little rosebud fingers, 10 little rosebud toes - that's what your furious female person is calmed by.</p> <p>The British electorate, men and women both, has grown very, very angry with Tony Blair in the year 2000. It's like watching a marriage disintegrate. \"You make me sick, you never listen, I'm fed up with being lied to, I can't trust you any more.\" The Millennium Eve revellers were angry, the Women's Institute was angry. Car-buyers and petrol-consumers are angry, teachers and parents of state-school children are angry, folks lying around on hospital trolleys are angry. Everyone in \"the countryside\" is hopping mad on a daily basis. Young couples living next door to registered paedophiles are murderous with rage.</p> <p>The Tuscan photocall will work like a double dose of Largactil on 50% of the voters. Little Leo will do what he was born to do: smother the nation's women in a rosy cloud of cootchie-coo and baby powder. Great result, Tony! It won't work with the angry blokes, mind you. But don't even think about Cherie in a bikini.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ooh, fabulous - not just one mingy holiday pic, but a whole scrapbook: Tony and the baby, the family and the baby (standing), the family and the baby (sitting), Kathryn and the baby, Kathryn and the baby's hat. Did they rehearse in front of a mirror? No, no, perish the thought. Anyway, you can't rehearse a three-month-old. I think we like Kathryn and the baby's hat best, don't we? Sooooo adorable. The artless little fanned toes, the toy bee waiting to be placed in the fat fist, the careful placement of the hatstrings over the cute chinless neck. No - wait, it's got to be the family and the baby (standing), with Tony on the left and Nicky on the right. That's my favourite. Best view of the clothes. Tony's dazzling white linen shirt (very Calvin), slightly transparent in the Tuscan sunshine (very moderne ), and layered over a slate-blue smart casual trouser (very natty). Great wardrobe call, Tony! And Cherie's come up trumps, too, hasn't she? She's had her difficulties with clothes, believe me, but this black outfit looks perfectly suitable. Black smoothes out any post-partum bulges, and a generous V-neck is always flattering to the fuller figure. I wish she'd stop wearing those odd bits of silver jewellery, though. You get too old for silver. She should mark the words of the Queen's frockmaker, the eternally elegant and tasteful Sir Hardy Amies, who knows a thing or two about dressing top people for photocalls: \"Silver belongs on the dining-table, not around the neck.\" It's time to go with gold, Cherie! Everybody knows the 80s are back. Kathryn and Nicky both look properly formal, with their washed hair, long trousers and freshly-laundered tops. I think you have to nod towards formal when you're staying with a prince, don't you? Is it a prince, or a count? Strozzo-Garozzo or something. Anyway, I bet he dresses to die for, like all Italian men. Nicky's even put a shirt on, bless him. Most 14-year-olds don't even own one. Euan's T-shirt is a bit of a let-down, but what I say is, the lad at least turned up. Did his bit for Dad. Faced the flashbulbs. Can't ask for more. The standing picture also offers the best view of the interesting family relationships. Leo is the only Blair who looks both unembarrassed and untroubled. Tony is the only Blair looking at the camera, which tells you something, doesn't it? Everyone else is looking at Leo (and I don't blame them), except for Euan who is looking at the sort of bottomless black hole that only a 16-year-old who hates life, hates his godawful parents and didn't bloody ask to live in bloody Downing Street, can stare into. Nicky is the only Blair who doesn't know what to do with his hands. Kathryn is the only Blair who seems prepared to link arms with Tony this year: the Blair arm-linking pictures having been such a feature of their previous holiday snaps. Everyone else is staying well clear of Tony. But then - he's got his hands full, of course. I once read that you can calm an angry man by showing him a picture of a woman in a bikini. It works; I tried it. Angry women are not calmed by pictures of bikinis, though. You need to show them cute little babes-in-arms: Ten little rosebud fingers, 10 little rosebud toes - that's what your furious female person is calmed by. The British electorate, men and women both, has grown very, very angry with Tony Blair in the year 2000. It's like watching a marriage disintegrate. \"You make me sick, you never listen, I'm fed up with being lied to, I can't trust you any more.\" The Millennium Eve revellers were angry, the Women's Institute was angry. Car-buyers and petrol-consumers are angry, teachers and parents of state-school children are angry, folks lying around on hospital trolleys are angry. Everyone in \"the countryside\" is hopping mad on a daily basis. Young couples living next door to registered paedophiles are murderous with rage. The Tuscan photocall will work like a double dose of Largactil on 50% of the voters. Little Leo will do what he was born to do: smother the nation's women in a rosy cloud of cootchie-coo and baby powder. Great result, Tony! It won't work with the angry blokes, mind you. But don't even think about Cherie in a bikini.",

On October 31, Johnson ordered a total halt to the bombing of North Vietnam, the precondition for getting the North and their Vietcong allies to join the talks. Two days later, under intense secret urgings from Nixon and his lieutenants, Thieu announced his government would not take part. Less than a week later, Nixon was elected president with less than a one-point margin in the popular vote over Humphrey.</p> <p><b> Playing with US lives</b><br></p> <p>The Vanity Fair article charges that Johnson knew what was going on. Intelligence reports to the president told him that Nixon and his running mate, Spiro Agnew, were playing politics with the lives of US soldiers. \"Had it been made public at the time, it would surely have destroyed Nixon's presidential hopes at one stroke, and forever,\" the authors write.</p> <p>Johnson offered Humphrey the chance to go public about Nixon, but Humphrey was afraid that the charges would be seen as election dirty tricks. Once Nixon had won, Johnson again contemplated revealing what he knew, but decided the national interest precluded it.</p> <p>In the weeks running up to the election, Nixon's public stance was that, if elected, he would bring the war to an end more effectively than Humphrey. He promised not to interfere with pre-election peace efforts, pledging that neither he nor Agnew \"will destroy the chance of peace\".</p> <p>In reality, however, Nixon used his campaign manager, John Mitchell, later his disgraced attorney general, to use go-betweens to encourage Thieu to believe he would get a better deal under a Nixon administration and to boycott the putative talks. Nixon constantly denied that he was conspiring with Thieu against the US government, but the release of previously classified FBI files used by the authors show this was exactly what he was doing.</p> <p>Chennault, Nixon's main go-between with the South Vietnamese, was a right-wing Republican society hostess who was Chinese born and lived in a newly constructed Washington apartment complex - named the Watergate. She was vice-chairman of the Republican election finance committee and an inveterate lobbyist on behalf of right-wing and pro-American Asian interests.</p> <p>Chennault regularly passed messages to Mitchell and Nixon during 1968 and they urged her to put pressure on the South Vietnamese leader to create delays and to refuse to take part in the peace talks.</p> <p>US embassy spy operations, including wiretaps of Thieu's offices, revealed the Thieu-Nixon connection in October and Johnson was briefed about them. One message from Thieu's ambassador in Washington, Bui Diem, told Thieu: \"Johnson and Humphrey will be replaced and then Nixon could change the US position.\"</p> <p>When Thieu pulled out of the talks, Johnson exploded. He told his advisers that he would go public on a development that could \"rock the world\". That development, he said, was Nixon's \"conniving\" with the Thieu regime. An adviser had told Johnson that Nixon was \"trying to frustrate the president by inciting Saigon to step up its demands\". \"It all adds up,\" Johnson told his advisers.</p> <p>On October 31, with the bombing halt announced, Mitchell rang Chennault and told her: \"Anna, I'm speaking on behalf of Mr Nixon. It's very important our Vietnamese friends understand our Republican position and I hope you have made that clear to them. Do you think they have decided not to go to Paris?\"</p> <p>Chennault made contact with Thieu once again. An FBI report said that she \"contacted [the] Vietnamese ambassador and advised him that she had received a message from her boss (not further identified) which her boss wanted her to give personally to the ambassador. She said the message was that the ambassador is to 'Hold on, we are gonna win' and that her boss also said 'Hold on, he understands all of it'.\"</p> <p>On November 2, three days before the election, Thieu announced that South Vietnam would not attend the talks.</p> <p>Johnson's bad relations with J Edgar Hoover at the FBI meant that Hoover, a Nixon ally, did not tell the president everything that his agents had unearthed. Even so, Johnson had learned enough to speak to Nixon by phone the weekend before the election. Nixon denied Chennault was working for him. When the phone was put down, it was later reported, \"Nixon and his friends collapsed with laughter\".</p> <p>Johnson was certain Nixon was lying, and told Humphrey what was going on. Humphrey learned about the Nixon-Thieu contacts while he was travelling by plane to a campaign. \"By God, when we land I'm going to denounce Thieu. I'll denounce Nixon. I'll tell about the whole thing,\" he shouted to aides. But he never did.</p> <p>In the five weeks leading up to the election of 1968, 960 Americans were killed in Vietnam. In the years to come, under Nixon, 20,763 more US soldiers would die.</p> <p>\"What the Nixon people did,\" the US diplomat Richard Holbrooke, then attached to the advance US guard to the Paris talks, tells Vanity Fair, \"was perhaps even a violation of the law.</p> <p>\"They massively, directly and covertly interfered in a major diplomatic negotiation, probably one of the most important negotiations in American diplomatic history.\"</p> <p><b> 1957</b> Beginning of communist insurgency in South Vietnam</p> <p><b> 1959</b> Weapons and men from North Vietnam begin infiltrating the South</p> <p><b> 1960 </b> US aid to the South Vietnamese president, Ngo Dinh Diem, increased</p> <p><b> 1962</b> President John F Kennedy provides US military advisers to South Vietnam (12,000 by end of year)</p> <p><b> 1963</b> Viet Cong, the communist guerrillas operating in South Vietnam, defeat units of ARVN, the South Vietnamese army.

The devastating new charge against Nixon, which mirrors long-held suspicions among members of President Lyndon Johnson's administration about the Republican leader's actions in the autumn of 1968, is made by the authors of a new study of Nixon's secret world in the latest issue of Vanity Fair magazine. \"The greatest honour history can bestow,\" reads the inscription on Nixon's black granite tombstone in California, \"is the title of peacemaker.\" But if the charges by authors Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan are correct, Nixon better deserves to be called a peacewrecker than peacemaker. At the heart of the new account was Nixon's fear that Vietnam peace efforts by President Johnson in the run-up to the November 1968 US presidential election could wreck Nixon's bid to oust Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic candidate, and capture the White House. Nixon's response to Johnson's efforts was to use a go-between, Anna Chennault, to urge the South Vietnam's president, Nguyen van Thieu, to resist efforts to force them to the peace table.

US embassy spy operations, including wiretaps of Thieu's offices, revealed the Thieu-Nixon connection in October and Johnson was briefed about them. One message from Thieu's ambassador in Washington, Bui Diem, told Thieu: \"Johnson and Humphrey will be replaced and then Nixon could change the US position.\" When Thieu pulled out of the talks, Johnson exploded. He told his advisers that he would go public on a development that could \"rock the world\". That development, he said, was Nixon's \"conniving\" with the Thieu regime. An adviser had told Johnson that Nixon was \"trying to frustrate the president by inciting Saigon to step up its demands\". \"It all adds up,\" Johnson told his advisers. On October 31, with the bombing halt announced, Mitchell rang Chennault and told her: \"Anna, I'm speaking on behalf of Mr Nixon. It's very important our Vietnamese friends understand our Republican position and I hope you have made that clear to them. Do you think they have decided not to go to Paris?\" Chennault made contact with Thieu once again. An FBI report said that she \"contacted [the] Vietnamese ambassador and advised him that she had received a message from her boss (not further identified) which her boss wanted her to give personally to the ambassador. She said the message was that the ambassador is to 'Hold on, we are gonna win' and that her boss also said 'Hold on, he understands all of it'.\" On November 2, three days before the election, Thieu announced that South Vietnam would not attend the talks. Johnson's bad relations with J Edgar Hoover at the FBI meant that Hoover, a Nixon ally, did not tell the president everything that his agents had unearthed. Even so, Johnson had learned enough to speak to Nixon by phone the weekend before the election. Nixon denied Chennault was working for him. When the phone was put down, it was later reported, \"Nixon and his friends collapsed with laughter\". Johnson was certain Nixon was lying, and told Humphrey what was going on. Humphrey learned about the Nixon-Thieu contacts while he was travelling by plane to a campaign. \"By God, when we land I'm going to denounce Thieu. I'll denounce Nixon. I'll tell about the whole thing,\" he shouted to aides. But he never did. In the five weeks leading up to the election of 1968, 960 Americans were killed in Vietnam. In the years to come, under Nixon, 20,763 more US soldiers would die. \"What the Nixon people did,\" the US diplomat Richard Holbrooke, then attached to the advance US guard to the Paris talks, tells Vanity Fair, \"was perhaps even a violation of the law. \"They massively, directly and covertly interfered in a major diplomatic negotiation, probably one of the most important negotiations in American diplomatic history.\" 1957 Beginning of communist insurgency in South Vietnam 1959 Weapons and men from North Vietnam begin infiltrating the South 1960 US aid to the South Vietnamese president, Ngo Dinh Diem, increased 1962 President John F Kennedy provides US military advisers to South Vietnam (12,000 by end of year) 1963 Viet Cong, the communist guerrillas operating in South Vietnam, defeat units of ARVN, the South Vietnamese army.

We are not there to make a profit from these people like ruthless landlords, but we will obviously recoup our costs.\" The local vicar, the Rev Phil Denison, said: \"Everything was taken into consideration at the hearing and those in the best position to judge these matters have made what they feel is the right decision. \"Somerset and Over Stowey are cosmopolitan places and have always been enriched by receiving visitors. I feel we will only benefit from having a more multicultural society here. Perhaps some people have invested quite a lot of time and money in opposing the scheme and don't like losing.\"",

In its latest inquiry into the management of Britain's national insurance fund, the public accounts committee also advised ministers against over-reliance on too few software suppliers. The MPs singled out Andersen Consulting, which runs the troubled national insurance recording system (called NIRS2), for deterring rival bids for the multimillion pound contract. In effect, by announcing that it would keep the intellectual copyright to the NIRS2 system it designed for the inland revenue, Andersen Consulting was able to bid \u00a3100m less than its rivals. \"They had put a value of \u00a3100m on these rights when submitting their original bid, which was one reason why their bid was significantly lower than other bidders,\" said the PAC report. When the contract comes up for renewal, bidders will have to pay Andersen \u00a314m \"in return for which they would be granted a licence to use the software\", said the MPs, who said they wanted the inland revenue to re-examine the benefits of joint ownership of such rights. Such decisions, warned the MPs, whose chairman is the Conservative David Davis, were \"an important part of the management of risk\" in these public/private projects.

      "bodyText": "Europe's leading football clubs are set to cash in on their popularity by joining forces with motor racing after the announcement yesterday of a unique commercial partnership between the two sports. Premier 1 Grand Prix will involve 24 cars, painted in the colours of Europe's leading football clubs, racing over the course of a season. The likes of Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus have been asked to take part in what could be a lucrative extension of their brand names, generating millions of pounds in extra revenue. The clubs - there will be four each from England, Italy, France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands - will not have to invest any money in the new racing category but are likely to receive a share of the profits. Initially, there will be 12 races in 2002, with 11 being staged in Europe and one in South America. Graham Kelly, the former chief executive of the Football Association, is one of the directors of Premier 1 and has been liaising with English clubs and those on the continent. The organisers have picked the 24 clubs on the basis of their domestic performances over the past six years and it is believed that, as well as Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal from the Premier League have been approached. Kelly said: \"Nobody has turned us down. There is quite a lot of interest and things are looking pretty positive.

Premier 1 is not being seen as a rival to formula one and races will not clash with grands prix. All the cars in Premier 1 will be the same so there will be no constructors' competition and pit stops will be allowed only for tyre changes. Plans for the new competition are to be formally submitted by the Motor Sports Association, the UK's national club, to the council of the FIA, the sport's world governing body, in October. If the go-ahead is given then the new competition will be up and running by the start of 2002.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Like its British counterpart, in Germany the auction of third generation mobile phone licences has got off to a slow start. Yesterday was day seven and the 85th round of bidding saw the total of leading bids top the DM20bn (\u00a36.15bn) finance minister Hans Eichel had pencilled into his budget calculations. A milestone of some sort, perhaps, but a very long way short of the \u00a320bn the auction is tipped to raise. </p> <p>Expect the pace to quicken. The rules of the auction say successive bids have to top the previous best offer by an amount set by the regulator at 10%. So the bid total is going up by more than DM2bn a throw and rising exponentially. </p> <p>It is a time for deep pockets. Though a total of 12 blocks are on offer, a winner needs to win at least two to secure a licence and the expectation - shared by the regulator - is that at least two groups will want three blocks. That would mean a total of five licences to share between the seven bidders. </p> <p>The betting is already focusing on some familiar names; T-Mobil which is part of Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone's Mannesmann Mobilfunk, Viag Interkom and Mobilcom, which are linked to BT and France Telecom respectively, and E-Plus-Hutchison. </p> <p>If the bidding does reach the level expected and if the line-up of successful bidders is as predicted, it is bound to re-ignite the debate about the cost of licences under an auction system and the knock-on effects that could have on future pricing of the service or the pace at which new networks can be rolled out - and about the competitive effect of a system which favours those with the greatest resources. </p> <p><strong> Oil measure </strong><br> </p> <p> Once upon a time there were the seven sisters. Now - pace TotalFinaElf - the world's oil industry is dominated by the big three - ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell and BP Amoco. </p> <p>Competition is fierce as the three seek to establish themselves as the leading player in the oil industry's premier league. With sky high oil prices each is firing on all cylinders. Last month Exxon Mobil reported second quarter figures up 123%. Last week Shell turned in a 95% improvement. Yesterday BP Amoco - complete with a first time contribution from Atlantic Richfield - turned in a 164% improvement. The question is how the three will differentiate themselves. Exxon Mobil has always seen itself as natural top dog. Certainly there is much about its financial discipline and consistent return on capital to admire. </p> <p>For its part BP Amoco has been a key player in the rationalisation of the oil industry with a string of acquisition - Amoco, Arco and Burmah Castrol. Shell, by contrast, has been very quiet on the merger and acquisition front. </p> <p>Yet the Europeans both share the view that big oil needs to present an environmentally friendly face to the world. BP Amoco is pushing the marketing boat out behind its new Beyond Petroleum campaign. A recent Shell advert carried the headline: Protect endangered species... or become one? </p> <p>Whether such an approach will help them appear more progressive than Exxon Mobil remains to be seen. Winning an eco-friendly reputation is not an easy one for an oil company. Yesterday, for example, Greenpeace activists spent a second day on a BP Amoco barge in protest against the development of the Northstar field off Alaska. </p> <p>But as the battle to be first among equals intensifies, the financial community will become ever keener to decide on a benchmark which will allow consistent comparison of the trio's respective performances. </p> <p><strong> Dump dollars </strong><br> </p> <p> Here's a test for tyro forex dealers. An economy is running a trade deficit of $1bn a day. Its employment growth is slowing. Its stock market is 5% down since the start of the year and 75% of the shares quoted on it have fallen. Would you buy that country's currency or not? </p> <p>The textbook answer is, of course, no. All the fundamentals point to that currency falling rather than rising. In the real world, however, the answer is that you thrust rationality to one side and buy truckloads of the US dollar (the currency in question, in case you had not guessed). </p> <p>So, despite the fact that there are signs of an incipient slowdown across the Atlantic and despite the US economy becoming increasingly uncompetitive, the dollar has recently resumed its upward trend against the euro. Yesterday, the single currency dipped below 90 cents for a time, with some dealers expecting it to test its record low of 88.40 within the next couple of weeks. </p> <p>Plausible explanations for this are rather thin on the ground. If anything, US growth is likely to surprise on the downside over the coming months, while euroland activity should remain strong. The euro may have further to fall, but not much further. There are times when the textbooks are right. This is one of them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Like its British counterpart, in Germany the auction of third generation mobile phone licences has got off to a slow start. Yesterday was day seven and the 85th round of bidding saw the total of leading bids top the DM20bn (\u00a36.15bn) finance minister Hans Eichel had pencilled into his budget calculations. A milestone of some sort, perhaps, but a very long way short of the \u00a320bn the auction is tipped to raise. Expect the pace to quicken. The rules of the auction say successive bids have to top the previous best offer by an amount set by the regulator at 10%. So the bid total is going up by more than DM2bn a throw and rising exponentially. It is a time for deep pockets. Though a total of 12 blocks are on offer, a winner needs to win at least two to secure a licence and the expectation - shared by the regulator - is that at least two groups will want three blocks. That would mean a total of five licences to share between the seven bidders. The betting is already focusing on some familiar names; T-Mobil which is part of Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone's Mannesmann Mobilfunk, Viag Interkom and Mobilcom, which are linked to BT and France Telecom respectively, and E-Plus-Hutchison. If the bidding does reach the level expected and if the line-up of successful bidders is as predicted, it is bound to re-ignite the debate about the cost of licences under an auction system and the knock-on effects that could have on future pricing of the service or the pace at which new networks can be rolled out - and about the competitive effect of a system which favours those with the greatest resources. Oil measure Once upon a time there were the seven sisters. Now - pace TotalFinaElf - the world's oil industry is dominated by the big three - ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell and BP Amoco. Competition is fierce as the three seek to establish themselves as the leading player in the oil industry's premier league. With sky high oil prices each is firing on all cylinders. Last month Exxon Mobil reported second quarter figures up 123%. Last week Shell turned in a 95% improvement. Yesterday BP Amoco - complete with a first time contribution from Atlantic Richfield - turned in a 164% improvement. The question is how the three will differentiate themselves. Exxon Mobil has always seen itself as natural top dog. Certainly there is much about its financial discipline and consistent return on capital to admire. For its part BP Amoco has been a key player in the rationalisation of the oil industry with a string of acquisition - Amoco, Arco and Burmah Castrol. Shell, by contrast, has been very quiet on the merger and acquisition front. Yet the Europeans both share the view that big oil needs to present an environmentally friendly face to the world. BP Amoco is pushing the marketing boat out behind its new Beyond Petroleum campaign. A recent Shell advert carried the headline: Protect endangered species... or become one? Whether such an approach will help them appear more progressive than Exxon Mobil remains to be seen. Winning an eco-friendly reputation is not an easy one for an oil company. Yesterday, for example, Greenpeace activists spent a second day on a BP Amoco barge in protest against the development of the Northstar field off Alaska. But as the battle to be first among equals intensifies, the financial community will become ever keener to decide on a benchmark which will allow consistent comparison of the trio's respective performances. Dump dollars Here's a test for tyro forex dealers. An economy is running a trade deficit of $1bn a day. Its employment growth is slowing. Its stock market is 5% down since the start of the year and 75% of the shares quoted on it have fallen. Would you buy that country's currency or not? The textbook answer is, of course, no. All the fundamentals point to that currency falling rather than rising. In the real world, however, the answer is that you thrust rationality to one side and buy truckloads of the US dollar (the currency in question, in case you had not guessed). So, despite the fact that there are signs of an incipient slowdown across the Atlantic and despite the US economy becoming increasingly uncompetitive, the dollar has recently resumed its upward trend against the euro. Yesterday, the single currency dipped below 90 cents for a time, with some dealers expecting it to test its record low of 88.40 within the next couple of weeks. Plausible explanations for this are rather thin on the ground. If anything, US growth is likely to surprise on the downside over the coming months, while euroland activity should remain strong. The euro may have further to fall, but not much further. There are times when the textbooks are right. This is one of them.",

      "bodyText": "BP yesterday promised a resurgence in North Sea activity, earmarking almost \u00a3664m to be spent on a range of projects in untapped reserves. Spending next year is to be increased further in what the petrochemicals group described as an \"exciting\" area as oil prices remain close to a nine-year high. The global oil industry's second largest company is awash with cash after reporting record second-quarter profits - 164% higher at \u00a32.4bn - and is under pressure to spend it or give it back to shareholders through buybacks. Chief executive Sir John Browne said BP had encouraging oil and gas discoveries in offshore US fields, Angola and the Caspian Sea, but that the UK sector should not be seen as an area in decline. \"Obituaries for the North Sea have been written somewhat prematurely. There are some exciting things to do, and North Sea investment is rising for several reasons,\" he said, pointing to developments in technology with advanced control systems and enhanced recovery techniques. BP's production of crude and natural gas in the UK sector fell in the first half of the year to 550,000 barrels a day from 575,000 in the same period last year, but overall North Sea output is not in decline. Experts say the number of offshore jobs is unlikely to increase, and yards that build big platforms will continue to struggle as oil is produced via hi-tech sub-acquatic systems controlled from the shore. BP plans to raise its overall capital spend by \u00a3900m to \u00a38.9bn per annum over the next three years as it aims to increase oil production by up to 5% each year and gas output by nearly 10%. Capital spending in the second quarter was \u00a31.6bn, up 35% compared with 12 months ago - of which \u00a3199m went to the North Sea. The record pro-forma result, adjusted for special items, at \u00a32.4bn compared with analyst expectations of \u00a32.19bn to \u00a32.3bn and came on the back of strong crude prices and cost-cutting undertaken following a series of mergers. But the company came under fire from financial analysts at a presentation to them in London. They argued that the series of mergers had made it difficult to compare like with like.

The future should be better, he insisted \"now we can demonstrate with simplicity what the results have been\". The BP chairman said the group had continued to beat its targets on savings with the integration of BP and Arco saving up to \u00a3600m during the last six months. \"These results represent the cumulative impact of the progress we've made over the last few years - growth in volume and, equally important, growth in total productivity,\" he explained.

There was also a 7% increase in like for like sales for June and July, partly helped by Euro 2000. Profits exclude \u00a3400,000 exceptional costs and a \u00a31.4m charge relating to new accounting standards. Central distribution, allowing SFI to negotiate directly with drink makers, is expected to save \u00a31.5m over three years. SFI hopes to use the Slug and Lettuce brand to compliment its existing outlets; its shares closed at 209.5p, up 14p.",

Lawyers for the superintendent, who remains suspended after he was cleared in June of criminal misuse of informers, have sent allegations to the home secretary, Jack Straw, and are demanding a criminal investigation. The move follows the revelation that a separate claim of \"dirty tricks\" against Mr Mallon, made under recent legislation to protect whistleblowers, came from the head of the force's media department. Joanne Malone has worked for Cleveland for 13 years and supervised much of the official reaction to the 2 year investigation of Mr Mallon, Operation Lancet.

Her whistleblowing claim accuses the chief constable of Cleveland, Barry Shaw, of sanctioning the leak of a severely critical analysis of Mr Mallon's policing methods by independent barristers advising the Home Office. The QCs described the superintendent, nicknamed \"Robocop\" after admiring comments on zero tolerance from Tony Blair, Jack Straw and Michael Howard, as having run a \"woeful and chaotic\" regime in Middlesbrough, including deals with criminal informants which showed \"a complete indifference\" to the law. Ms Malone, who made her allegations under the Public Interest Disclosure Act to Cleveland's assistant chief constable Della Canning, is due back from leave next week. Her claims are being investigated by South Yorkshire's chief constable, Michael Hedges, at the request of Cleveland police authority, which decided last week not to suspend Mr Shaw during the inquiry.

      "bodyText": "Shares in Kingfisher, the company behind Woolworths and B&amp;Q, leapt 16p to 529p yesterday after heavyweight broker Merrill Lynch upgraded its near-term rating on the stock to \"buy\" from \"neutral\" and set a 12-month price target of 620p. The move followed a meeting with the company that left Merrill analyst Mal Patel with the view that the group was undervalued. In the past month Kingfisher shares have fallen around 25% as a number of brokers have moved to reduce their forecasts to take account of the tough trading environment for general merchandise and the costs of rolling out new formats. This has left the stock trading on a 2001 price-to-earnings ratio of around 16, which Mr Patel feels more than discounts risks. Mr Patel believes the company will use interim results, due on September 13, to reassure the market regarding its strategy and earnings prospects. This, he feels, will justify a re-rating for the shares.",

That finding was at variance with claims that the CPF survey showed party activists, many of them middle aged or older, are in danger of placing \"too heavy an emphasis on traditional marriage. But the survey did confirm that Mr Hague is going with the grain of party sentiment in his campaign to retain section 28, which outlaws the promo tion of homosexuality in schools, and that Ivan Massow, the gay insurance tycoon who defected from the Conservatives to Labour last week, was entitled to feel uncomfortable in the party. \"There is overwhelming opposition to the inclusion of overtly homosexual or lesbian couples in any definition of a family,\" say party analysts.

Just 22 groups' definitions included \"long term social units including same sex ones\". There is also evidence of support for working women, through tax breaks, childcare, longer school terms and other options in the part of the sur vey which was designed to ask what the Conservatives should do \"to appeal to the modern working woman\".

But the MP for Worthing West insisted that the party leadership was more in touch with public feeling on key family issues such as pensions, section 28 and family structure than Labour. \"On section 28 no less an authority than the prime minister himself admits they are regarded as out of touch,\" said Mr Bottomley.

Democracy in South America is not yet secure.</p> <p>Riots accompanied President Fujimori's inauguration last month for a third term. The anger was provoked by his \"victory\" on May 26 in an election decider that lacked such niceties as an opponent and a referee.

President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela and President Alberto Fujimori of Peru may not appear to have much in common. Yet they do. Both are men of the people, outsiders who emerged from obscurity to win power. They mean to keep it. They play by the rules when the rules suit and change them when they do not. They are modern examples of caudillos - the strongmen who figured so often in the past government of Latin American countries. (See some of the better known below; there are many more.) Democracy in South America is not yet secure. Riots accompanied President Fujimori's inauguration last month for a third term. The anger was provoked by his \"victory\" on May 26 in an election decider that lacked such niceties as an opponent and a referee. Monitors from the Organisation of American States warned that the election could be \"neither free nor fair\" and withdrew. Alejandro Toledo, Fujimori's opponent, had already withdrawn, saying that abuses in the first round of the election should be investigated.

Twenty-three years later - and 12 years after he was offered early release if he confessed to killing Margaret Davies - he has finally been given the chance to prove his innocence. Yesterday the criminal cases review commission announced that his conviction was being referred to the court of appeal, after a three year investigation by West Mercia police. Friends of Williams, 67, said he was \"delighted and overjoyed\", but his daughter, Tereyna Wheatstone, said there was still a long way to go. \"We will not be able to celebrate fully until he has been cleared and is out of prison.\" Williams, a coach driver, was jailed for life at Worcester crown court for murdering Mrs Davies, 41, a divorcee. The two had been occasional lovers for 12 months but had split up in January 1977. Soon afterwards, Mrs Davies was found bound, gagged, strangled and stabbed at her home in Tupsley, Hereford. Williams was one of three suspects and was charged six months later. The prosecution admitted that its case was based on circumstantial evidence. Williams had been seen outside her house days before she was killed, and when detectives searched his room they found a magazine which had a picture of a woman lying gagged on a bed next to a man with a knife. Williams claimed that he was asleep at his parents' house when the murder took place, but it was a weak alibi and hard to substantiate. He did not give evidence at the trial. He denied murder but was found guilty by a 10-2 majority verdict. Doubts about the case emerged when his family began to investigate. Mrs Davies's diary, which contained the names of several lovers, was lost by detectives and was not produced in court. The timing of the murder was also questioned. A pathologist's report prepared for the police said she had been killed between 11pm on Friday and 6.30am the next morning. However, a schoolgirl claimed that she had seen Mrs Davies alive and well much later on Saturday morning. Two years ago the CCRC received a 250-page dossier from David Hallam, a former MEP for Shropshire and Hereford who took up Williams's campaign. The dossier detailed inconsistencies about the timing of Mrs Davies's death. \"We don't know the grounds of the CCRC decision yet, but we know a 40-page statement of reasons has been sent to the appeal court,\" said Mr Hallam. \"We are aware there is someone out there who knows who committed this crime, and we would ask them to come forward to end this tragic story as quickly as possible.\" He added: \"This might seem strange, but Harold bears no grudges against the police. He believes they acted in good faith on the evidence they had, but the evidence was incomplete.\" Williams is at Sudbury open prison in Derbyshire. After he refused to sign a licence admitting his guilt to win parole, he told a Sunday newspaper: \"I know I could be outside fighting this case, but I was innocent when I came in, and that's how I want to leave. \"If I took the offer of parole I would have to agree to be released on licence, which would in effect mean signing a document saying I was a murderer.

Several politicians live in the area. A security guard suffered serious head injuries after being struck by shrapnel; two children, aged three and five, were among others hurt.</p> <p>Police said they received a telephone warning minutes before the bomb went off from a man who claimed to represent ETA.</p> <p>The two attacks yesterday may have been staged at short notice to prove that the organisation - which is thought to have relatively few \"commando\" units - had not been crippled by the deaths in Bilbao.</p> <p>But the sudden upsurge in violence is more likely to reflect the determination of ETA's newly installed hardline leadership to escalate its campaign, which has now claimed 12 lives since the group ended its ceasefire in December.</p> <p>The killings have damaged relations between the governing Popular party, under Jose Maria Aznar, in Madrid and the Basque regional government. The regional and national leaders disagree about the breakdown of last year's abortive peace talks.</p> <p>The victim of yesterday's first attack was identified as Jose Maria Korta. He was killed outside his machine tool factory in Zumaia, near San Sebastian, when a device packed into another car was triggered as he parked his vehicle alongside.</p> <p>Married with three children, Korta was the president of an association of local businessmen and an outspoken critic of ETA.

      "bodyText": "Barely 12 hours after four members of the separatist group ETA apparently blew themselves apart transporting a bomb in Bilbao on Monday night, a prominent Basque businessman was killed yesterday by a car bomb. A third blast, caused by another car bomb, injured 11 people in a mainly residential area north of Madrid's city centre yesterday evening. Several politicians live in the area. A security guard suffered serious head injuries after being struck by shrapnel; two children, aged three and five, were among others hurt. Police said they received a telephone warning minutes before the bomb went off from a man who claimed to represent ETA. The two attacks yesterday may have been staged at short notice to prove that the organisation - which is thought to have relatively few \"commando\" units - had not been crippled by the deaths in Bilbao. But the sudden upsurge in violence is more likely to reflect the determination of ETA's newly installed hardline leadership to escalate its campaign, which has now claimed 12 lives since the group ended its ceasefire in December. The killings have damaged relations between the governing Popular party, under Jose Maria Aznar, in Madrid and the Basque regional government. The regional and national leaders disagree about the breakdown of last year's abortive peace talks. The victim of yesterday's first attack was identified as Jose Maria Korta. He was killed outside his machine tool factory in Zumaia, near San Sebastian, when a device packed into another car was triggered as he parked his vehicle alongside. Married with three children, Korta was the president of an association of local businessmen and an outspoken critic of ETA. Businessmen in the Basque region are regularly threatened if they fail to pay \"revolutionary taxes\" to ETA and have often been targeted for assassination. Forensic experts in Bilbao spent yesterday examining the wreckage left after a car carrying four ETA activists disintegrated in an explosion on Monday night. The car was said by police to have been carrying up to 30kg (66lb) of explosives which were accidentally detonated. Initially three people were believed to have died but it was later confirmed that there was a fourth victim. Officers had difficulty identifying the bodies because of the force of the blast. Among those thought to have died was one of ETA's most wanted commanders, Patxi Rementeria, the leader of the Vizcaya commando, one of the group's most active units, and was suspected of taking part in the 1997 kidnapping and murder of the Basque politician Miguel Angel Blanco whose death brought 6m Spaniards on to the streets in protest. The conservative Popular party said the ETA members' deaths had averted another attack. But Basque regional political leaders lamented the loss of life and urged that dialogue be reopened. ETA called a ceasefire in September 1998, but the peace process ended in failure after just one negotiating session with the government in 1999. ETA called off its ceasefire in early December. The government offered to move prisoners back to jails nearer home, but refused to concede any more ground on the issue of Basque self-determination, which it fears will lead to Spain's fragmentation. The Basque regional government already has considerable autonomy: tax-raising powers, use of the Basque language in schools, and its own police force. It is run by the Basque National party. ETA's political wing, Herri Batasuna, has seen its political support waning - ETA called for a boycott of the general election in March. The organisation, which used to copy IRA techniques and follow Sinn Fein's political progress in Northern Ireland assiduously, has fallen under the control of hardline factions. One of the organisation's dominant strategists is thought to be Soledad Iparaguirre, whose boyfriend was killed by the security forces in 1981. The Basque National party, which persuaded ETA to call a ceasefire, cut its links with Herri Batasuna after the killings resumed. The separatists have been blamed for nearly 800 deaths since they began their campaign in 1968.

      "body": "<p>The right has been mobilising around rights. Tory MPs and their allies in the Murdoch and Conrad Black newspapers are working up a head of steam about the Human Rights Act. To them it is mainly a stick with which to beat Europe, as if the \"fundamental charter\" now being discussed inside the European Union had anything to do with the implementation of the HRA, two years after it was enacted amid silence on Tory benches and a year after it peacefully came into force in Scotland.</p> <p>To their gallery of stock villains, the Tories were this week delighted to add Caesar's wife - triply stained as a lawyer, an enthusiast for the statute and, unpardonable sin on the right, a woman with political views possibly different from her spouse's. In sum, the Tory position on the new human rights law is a farrago of tabloid headlines and plain ignorance - manifest in the continuing confusion between the European Court of Justice (Luxembourg, part of the EU) and the European Court of Human Rights (Strasbourg, under the Council of Europe).</p> <p>This is a pity. For legitimate questions can be asked about the act and the case made for it by Cherie Booth QC. A sharper opposition might have picked up her argument that human rights can be confined to tried and trusted terrain: race, employment, the behaviour of the police and public authorities. Why should her \"new rights culture\" stop there? Perhaps Mrs Blair knows that a third way government is none too keen on positive rights, to employment, minimum standards of welfare or health. It might have to spend more than even generous Gordon has allowed.</p> <p>Human rights are often couched in individualist, anti-collective terms, which is another reason why Tory opposition to the act is so puzzling. People are to be protected against misuse of power by police and other agents of the state. But other rights contained in the act, to privacy, against racial or gender discrimination, will need to be policed; government will have to be strong in order to enforce them.

      "bodyText": "The right has been mobilising around rights. Tory MPs and their allies in the Murdoch and Conrad Black newspapers are working up a head of steam about the Human Rights Act. To them it is mainly a stick with which to beat Europe, as if the \"fundamental charter\" now being discussed inside the European Union had anything to do with the implementation of the HRA, two years after it was enacted amid silence on Tory benches and a year after it peacefully came into force in Scotland. To their gallery of stock villains, the Tories were this week delighted to add Caesar's wife - triply stained as a lawyer, an enthusiast for the statute and, unpardonable sin on the right, a woman with political views possibly different from her spouse's. In sum, the Tory position on the new human rights law is a farrago of tabloid headlines and plain ignorance - manifest in the continuing confusion between the European Court of Justice (Luxembourg, part of the EU) and the European Court of Human Rights (Strasbourg, under the Council of Europe). This is a pity. For legitimate questions can be asked about the act and the case made for it by Cherie Booth QC. A sharper opposition might have picked up her argument that human rights can be confined to tried and trusted terrain: race, employment, the behaviour of the police and public authorities. Why should her \"new rights culture\" stop there? Perhaps Mrs Blair knows that a third way government is none too keen on positive rights, to employment, minimum standards of welfare or health. It might have to spend more than even generous Gordon has allowed. Human rights are often couched in individualist, anti-collective terms, which is another reason why Tory opposition to the act is so puzzling. People are to be protected against misuse of power by police and other agents of the state. But other rights contained in the act, to privacy, against racial or gender discrimination, will need to be policed; government will have to be strong in order to enforce them. Ms Booth cited, for example, litigation under the act requiring the state to protect demonstrators from attack. A careful line will have to be followed by courts and legislators if the rights culture is not to become a charter for selfishness, nimbyism and weak government. She is absolutely right to say that there is an ideological and party political dimension to all this. Ms Booth belongs to swish new lawyers' chambers which by all accounts will be kept busy as the thing beds down. The \"learning curve\" - Lord Chief Justice Woolf's phrase - may last a long time.

Gretel Prescott, 64, is one of 150 people who have so far complained to Amnesty International about its mailshot, after being taken in by its apparent authenticity. Mrs Prescott, a member of the campaigning organisation for 30 years, said: \"I was shocked, I was actually shaking, my heart was pumping. I thought it had stopped when I read it.\" \"Prepare to defend yourself\" was stamped on the envelope. The letter bore a case number and stamp in the top right corner and started with the recipient's name. It read: \"I am writing to inform you that following investigations by this department, we are intending to bring charges against you concerning certain matters. \"I cannot go into more detail at this stage _ the exact nature of the charge is to be kept secret from you. \"I have in my possession a full confession awaiting your signature. Its exact content, however, will also be kept secret from you. Should you show any reluctance to sign this confession you will be tortured until such time as you change your mind.\" The letter said there would be no lawyer and that the trial would be held in secret. It continued: \"When you are found guilty, you will not be told what your sentence is, but it may well involve flogging, amputation or public beheading _ You will be hearing from us very soon.\" On the other side, however, the letter said: \"What you've read may seem like an absurd nightmare. But in Saudi Arabia it is a terrifying reality.\" Mrs Prescott said: \"It's shock tactics, and you feel: 'I'm not going to support them anymore if they're going to give me heart failure. I want nothing more to do with them.'\" An Amnesty spokesman said it had written to those who had complained apologising for any distress caused. The campaign aimed \"to focus attention on the inadequacy of the Saudi Arabian judicial system,\" he said. The letter was \"mainly intended to raise awareness, money and support for that campaign _ \"The work we do revolves around very distressing things. There is no easy way to talk to people about how people in Saudi Arabia are tortured into signing a false confession.\"",

He appeared to deliver the ball off the wrong foot. Sharp inswingers, mixed with leg-cutters, brought him close to a hat-trick in the Lord's Test in 1946, when he dismissed Len Hutton and Denis Compton, and finished with Cyril Washbrook and Wally Hammond for figures of five for 118 from 57 overs.</p> <p>At the end of that tour, Raymond Robertson-Glasgow wrote: \"My chief memory is not of our own players, fine as they often were, but of Amarnath baffling the best England batsmen with his subtleties of swerve.\" In a first-class match against Patialaat Bombay in 1958-59, Amarnath bowled so beautifully that his dream figures read: 7-7-0-4. In his Test career, he scored 878 runs at 24.38, including a century, and claimed 45 wickets at 32.91. In his first-class career, he scored 10,323 runs at 41.62, including 31 centuries, and took 457 wickets at 22.93.</p> <p>Amarnath later served as manager, selector and chairman of India's selectors. His assessment of Australia's weakness against off-spin bowling on a turning track was the telling factor in India's historic triumph at Kanpur in 1959. Crucially, he insisted on the inclusion of the otherwise forgotten Jasu Patel, and his instructions to captain GS Ramchand to bowl the off-spinner from the pavilion end - to exploit the \"rough\" made by fast bowler Alan Davidson in his follow-through - did much to engineer the batting collapse.</p> <p>Amarnath's sons, Surinder, Mohinder and Rajeender, all played first-class cricket. Surinder and Mohinder also represented their country, although both suffered for their father's reputation. The selectors, Mohinder observed, either did not like his face, or his surname.</p> <p>In his old age, Amarnath entertained journalists covering Test matches at Delhi and Kanpur with his fund of cricketing stories. He always kept his head high, and age could not diminish his swagger or temper his provocative nature. As Bradman said, half a century ago, he was a splendid ambassador for Indian cricket and the Indian nation.</p> <p>He is survived by three sons and two daughters.</p> <p>\u0095 Bhardwaj 'Lala' Amarnath, cricketer, born September 11 1911; died August 5 2000</p>",

In his first-class career, he scored 10,323 runs at 41.62, including 31 centuries, and took 457 wickets at 22.93. Amarnath later served as manager, selector and chairman of India's selectors. His assessment of Australia's weakness against off-spin bowling on a turning track was the telling factor in India's historic triumph at Kanpur in 1959. Crucially, he insisted on the inclusion of the otherwise forgotten Jasu Patel, and his instructions to captain GS Ramchand to bowl the off-spinner from the pavilion end - to exploit the \"rough\" made by fast bowler Alan Davidson in his follow-through - did much to engineer the batting collapse. Amarnath's sons, Surinder, Mohinder and Rajeender, all played first-class cricket. Surinder and Mohinder also represented their country, although both suffered for their father's reputation. The selectors, Mohinder observed, either did not like his face, or his surname. In his old age, Amarnath entertained journalists covering Test matches at Delhi and Kanpur with his fund of cricketing stories. He always kept his head high, and age could not diminish his swagger or temper his provocative nature. As Bradman said, half a century ago, he was a splendid ambassador for Indian cricket and the Indian nation. He is survived by three sons and two daughters. \u0095 Bhardwaj 'Lala' Amarnath, cricketer, born September 11 1911; died August 5 2000",

      "body": "<p>It would be really quite difficult to dream up a political issue that better suited the agenda of the Conservative newspapers and the Tory party in this country than a \"story\" that somehow managed to bring together the subject of human rights and the person of Cherie Booth QC.</p> <p>This one has got everything that Conservative opinion in Britain most detests: a rich, powerful, clever, successful, working mother with a professional commitment to enforcing the new Human Rights Act as enshrined in legislation carried through parliament by - of all things - her husband's government.</p> <p>Conservative opinion does not like human rights much. It isn't quite in tune with the subject, which can be about all sorts of uncomfortable issues for Conservatives - such as equality under the law for homosexuals, or being treated fairly at work whatever your race or gender, or being dealt with equally by the police irrespective of the colour of your skin or your social cachet.</p> <p>And if all that isn't bad enough, Conservative opinion must be additionally suspicious about the new Human Rights Act, not only because it has been introduced by a Labour administration with what is now perceived as a hidden socialist agenda, but because the dreaded word \"Europe\" is hovering around there in the background. The new law is an enactment within British legislation of the European Convention on Human Rights and, without actually pausing to consider what is implied by this, Conservative opinion is wholly against the very notion of enforcing anything that may have been suggested by anything European.</p> <p>Yet all of this high principle and low politics is as nothing compared with Conservative opinion about the prime minister's wife. She is one of the leading human rights lawyers in Britain. She is recognised as such, paid as such and has been professionally honoured as such by being given silk. She has decided to establish a new set of chambers planned specifically to handle the human rights cases predicted in consequence of the implentation of the new human rights law, which comes into force on October 2.</p> <p>This seems a wholly pragmatic and businesslike attitude for a professional woman such as Ms Booth to have adopted. As well as being a forceful advocate, it is the kind of approach which must have got her to the top of her profession. I don't know Ms Booth myself, I have never spoken to her and, as it happens, I have my reservations about lawyers and the way they make their money. But I do believe in human rights. I think they should be laid down by law and enforced and that this exercise therefore seems to be the acceptable face of legal profiteering. Had I not known the Conservative party better I might even have imagined - silly me - that Conservative opinion would applaud such enterprise and initiative and money-making potential. Isn't that what Conservatives do all the time? Isn't that what they're for ?</p> <p>Yet Conservative opinion has leapt upon Ms Booth, unleashing the most extraordinarily venomous attacks upon her. The Tories were given their cue by their newly appointed home affairs spokesman, one John Bercow, a young man of 37 of whom it has been said that only his hair is parted in the centre. In what ranks as a typically outspoken outburst, he suggested that Cherie Booth was a cross between Lady Macbeth and Hillary Clinton and opined that it would be \"helpful\" if she would observe the convention by which those married to prime ministers do not push their own political agendas upon the populace.</p> <p>What convention? Some prime ministers' spouses choose not to work, but few of them deny themselves the opportunity to express themselves. Denis Thatcher pushed his political agenda at every opportunity. He did not speak in public. He did not air his views. But he continued making money and privately telling people exactly what he thought about everything that was going on in politics. Cherie Booth is a working woman. She has, against all difficulties -including every middle-aged working woman's nightmare, an unexpected late pregnancy - managed to continue to operate efficiently and independently. She has represented individuals in court in cases specifically brought against her husband's government - for example in challenging British opposition to European law.</p> <p>What Mr Bercow is saying in reality, of course, is that women shouldn't work, that Cherie's place is back at home with the baby, being supportive of her husband and helping the teenagers with their homework.

      "bodyText": "It would be really quite difficult to dream up a political issue that better suited the agenda of the Conservative newspapers and the Tory party in this country than a \"story\" that somehow managed to bring together the subject of human rights and the person of Cherie Booth QC. This one has got everything that Conservative opinion in Britain most detests: a rich, powerful, clever, successful, working mother with a professional commitment to enforcing the new Human Rights Act as enshrined in legislation carried through parliament by - of all things - her husband's government. Conservative opinion does not like human rights much. It isn't quite in tune with the subject, which can be about all sorts of uncomfortable issues for Conservatives - such as equality under the law for homosexuals, or being treated fairly at work whatever your race or gender, or being dealt with equally by the police irrespective of the colour of your skin or your social cachet. And if all that isn't bad enough, Conservative opinion must be additionally suspicious about the new Human Rights Act, not only because it has been introduced by a Labour administration with what is now perceived as a hidden socialist agenda, but because the dreaded word \"Europe\" is hovering around there in the background. The new law is an enactment within British legislation of the European Convention on Human Rights and, without actually pausing to consider what is implied by this, Conservative opinion is wholly against the very notion of enforcing anything that may have been suggested by anything European. Yet all of this high principle and low politics is as nothing compared with Conservative opinion about the prime minister's wife. She is one of the leading human rights lawyers in Britain. She is recognised as such, paid as such and has been professionally honoured as such by being given silk. She has decided to establish a new set of chambers planned specifically to handle the human rights cases predicted in consequence of the implentation of the new human rights law, which comes into force on October 2. This seems a wholly pragmatic and businesslike attitude for a professional woman such as Ms Booth to have adopted. As well as being a forceful advocate, it is the kind of approach which must have got her to the top of her profession. I don't know Ms Booth myself, I have never spoken to her and, as it happens, I have my reservations about lawyers and the way they make their money. But I do believe in human rights. I think they should be laid down by law and enforced and that this exercise therefore seems to be the acceptable face of legal profiteering. Had I not known the Conservative party better I might even have imagined - silly me - that Conservative opinion would applaud such enterprise and initiative and money-making potential. Isn't that what Conservatives do all the time? Isn't that what they're for ? Yet Conservative opinion has leapt upon Ms Booth, unleashing the most extraordinarily venomous attacks upon her. The Tories were given their cue by their newly appointed home affairs spokesman, one John Bercow, a young man of 37 of whom it has been said that only his hair is parted in the centre. In what ranks as a typically outspoken outburst, he suggested that Cherie Booth was a cross between Lady Macbeth and Hillary Clinton and opined that it would be \"helpful\" if she would observe the convention by which those married to prime ministers do not push their own political agendas upon the populace. What convention? Some prime ministers' spouses choose not to work, but few of them deny themselves the opportunity to express themselves. Denis Thatcher pushed his political agenda at every opportunity. He did not speak in public. He did not air his views. But he continued making money and privately telling people exactly what he thought about everything that was going on in politics. Cherie Booth is a working woman. She has, against all difficulties -including every middle-aged working woman's nightmare, an unexpected late pregnancy - managed to continue to operate efficiently and independently. She has represented individuals in court in cases specifically brought against her husband's government - for example in challenging British opposition to European law. What Mr Bercow is saying in reality, of course, is that women shouldn't work, that Cherie's place is back at home with the baby, being supportive of her husband and helping the teenagers with their homework. It is an absurd argument, but in order to try to convey some potency to his outdated ideas, he then ludicrously couples the names of Lady Macbeth and Hillary Clinton as appropriate independent-minded wives whom he apparently thinks might serve to frighten the voters - and get his name in the newspapers. It is only with reluctance that I mention Mr Bercow, whom I do know slightly. He is a very assertive rightwing Conservative with a style which is widely prevalent in today's Tory party. Before becoming an MP in 1997 he was a lobbyist. He is also a former member and secretary of the Monday Club, and it is hard to imagine why anyone in public life should take lessons in human rights from a former secretary of the immigration and repatriation committee of that offensive and unpleasant organisation.

Even with an extra spell when he was recalled from retirement during the first world war, the hero of James Hilton's novella could barely notch up 40 years at Brookfield.</p> <p>A direct grant school until the 1970s, then a keen sup porter of the assisted places scheme, Birkenhead maintained a long tradition of drawing a substantial proportion of its boys from local families unable to afford fees.</p> <p>Harrison, the son of a not-very-well paid evangelist with the Mersey Mission to Seamen, started at the school at 11. Puffing up the hill on his bike each morning, he reckoned, gave him his stamina as a sportsman. He finished up as scrum-half of the 1st XV, captain of hockey and a star track athlete. He was also a leading light in school drama pro ductions, an enthusiasm he was to carry into adult life.</p> <p>In 1943, he went to Merton College, Oxford on a Royal Navy short course, was commissioned and served in destroyers. On demob, he returned to Merton to read English. He took his degree in 1949, and was wondering what career to pursue when his old headmaster telephoned to ask if he would help out for a short while in an emergency.</p> <p>Harrison had not thought of schoolteaching, and had no educational qualification - he never did get one - but he agreed to help. He liked it, and stayed on.

      "bodyText": "Michael Harrison, who has died aged 74, was a real-life Mr Chips, who comfortably exceeded that fictional schoolmaster's long association with one seat of learning. Man and boy, he spent 48 years within the walls of Birkenhead school, the last 15 as headmaster of its lower, or junior, school. Even with an extra spell when he was recalled from retirement during the first world war, the hero of James Hilton's novella could barely notch up 40 years at Brookfield. A direct grant school until the 1970s, then a keen sup porter of the assisted places scheme, Birkenhead maintained a long tradition of drawing a substantial proportion of its boys from local families unable to afford fees. Harrison, the son of a not-very-well paid evangelist with the Mersey Mission to Seamen, started at the school at 11. Puffing up the hill on his bike each morning, he reckoned, gave him his stamina as a sportsman. He finished up as scrum-half of the 1st XV, captain of hockey and a star track athlete. He was also a leading light in school drama pro ductions, an enthusiasm he was to carry into adult life. In 1943, he went to Merton College, Oxford on a Royal Navy short course, was commissioned and served in destroyers. On demob, he returned to Merton to read English. He took his degree in 1949, and was wondering what career to pursue when his old headmaster telephoned to ask if he would help out for a short while in an emergency. Harrison had not thought of schoolteaching, and had no educational qualification - he never did get one - but he agreed to help. He liked it, and stayed on. In one of his early classes was Andy Smith, to become better known as Andreas Whittam Smith, founder and first editor of the Independent. Harrison had an instinctive gift for drawing learning out of his pupils, rather than trying to hammer it in. As each new English class faced him for the first time, he would ask them how many nursery rhymes they could remember. Less than five was the usual reply, but, as Harrison began to recite them, the boys would be astonished to discover they knew up to 50. \"You see,\" he would tell the boys, \"you've been carrying more poetry around than you thought.\" One of his few laments, as he grew older, was that he could no longer call on familiarity with myths, legends and Bible stories; children simply did not know them. As a headmaster, Harrison succeeded not by courting popularity - he had no favourites, keeping all his charges at arm's length - but by reassuring the most timorous of new boys with the calmness and order he exuded. That he no longer taught English in this job was a wrench, but he managed to keep a toehold in literature by instilling a little poetry into the future boffins of the science sixth. After his retirement in 1990, he conducted memorably popular adult poetry classes all over the Wirral. His passions ranged from the English metaphysical poets to Welsh and Scottish bards and the relatively little-known American, John Crowe Ransom. Harrison's many other interests included birdwatching, acting with a semi-professional company formed by his friend, the writer Roger Lancelyn Greene, and singing with the Liverpool Philharmonic Choir. He reached the rank of commander in the Royal Naval Reserve and was made an MBE for organising summer adventure courses for sea cadets. In his first years back at Birkenhead, he met and married a preparatory school-teacher, Marguerite, always known as Bunty. She survives him, along with their three sons, two daughters and two grandsons. \u0095 John Michael Delamere Harrison, teacher, born August 25 1925; died July 12 2000",

I wrote immediately to the League's assistant director urging her to pass on the details of the allegations to me as soon as possible so that I could ensure that they were investigated effectively. On November 30, when I spoke to the League's annual general meeting, I again urged it to let me have those details and promised that I would not hesitate to call in the police. I said that staff who abuse prisoners need to be convicted and dismissed. The Howard League did not let me have the details and I wrote again asking for them on December 7 and again on February 16 this year. Finally, I wrote on May 9: \"The key issue here is the extent to which you accept my determination to reform Portland and deal appropriately with allegations of prison officers abusing prisoners. I would therefore urge you once again to consider whether you could disclose them to me personally_ Needless to say, the alternative of putting the material to the police remains open.\" It is for the Howard League to explain why it has chosen not to let me have the allegations sooner. Martin Narey Director general, Prison Service",

Six Swiss citizens, including two judges, are among 87 people accused of laundering profits and running speedboats across the Adriatic to land an estimated 250 tonnes of cigarettes in Italy each month. Police wire-taps revealed that the gang was planning to buy a stake in the Italian state tobacco-producing monopoly, MS, which is due to be privatised. The gang allegedly bought MS cigarettes for export through offshore companies, then smuggled them back into Italy where they were sold tax free. Franco Verda, 59, the president of a court in Lugano, an Italian-speaking Swiss town, is in a Zurich jail accused of tipping off the gang about the imminent freezing of their accounts.

Senior ministers indefinitely postponed the bill after they realised they could not get the two-thirds majority to get the changes approved by parliament. The decision to drop the reforms is a personal rebuff for President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who over the last five years has made the issue her top priority. In the run-up to the vote members of the cabinet were frantically lobbying MPs from smaller parties and the main opposition United National party to give their backing to the changes. Disgruntled ministers allege that the reason they were forced to postpone the vote was because 10 opposition members who favoured the new constitution were flown out of the country by their party to prevent them from voting. \"It looks as if the opposition has won this battle of the backroom negotiations.\" a government minister said.

President Clinton flew to one of the worst hit areas in Idaho to meet some of the 20,000 firefighters battling with the blazes. There are now 66 major fires ablaze in 11 states and hopes that some of the worst outbreaks could be contained swiftly proved unfounded. Evacuations were being planned for more homes as the fires reached more populated areas. Wildfires now engulf more than 866,000 acres of land across the western states as a combination of lightning, dry forests and dry air takes its toll. Idaho is the worst hit state with more than 350,000 acres consumed and new, mostly small, fires starting there every day. Mr Clinton was due to visit the Payette national forest in Idaho where the wildfire that has wiped out 23,000 acres started 26 days ago. \"They're the worst wildfires in 50 years and the president very much wanted to go out and see the people working on them,\" said the White House spokesman Jake Siewert. During his visit, the president was scheduled to meet some of the troops from Fort Hood in Texas who have been trained up to bolster the weary full-time civilian firefighting service. The government announced that it was releasing $150m (\u00a3100m) to assist the firefighting process. The governor of Idaho, Dirk Kempthorne, said: \"This could shape up to be the worst fire season in Idaho in 65 years of records kept. The conditions will only worsen.\" He predicted a long, hot summer. \"I think it's highly likely we'll be looking to the military for more help,\" the forest service chief, Mike Dombeck, said in Idaho, \"Our fire season could be another two months, maybe a little longer.\" The loss of land to wildfires so far this year totals more than 4m acres - already more than double the average over the last 10 years. Forest service officials are concerned that the fires have already spread so far at what is a relatively early time in the wildfire season. The national interagency fire centre in Boise, Idaho continued to show flashing \"new\" signs on its website page that charts the fires. Nevada reported four new wildfires and in Montana there was a fresh outbreak at Ryan Gulch which officials feared would lead to further evacuations. In the Umatilla national forest in Oregon, there were fears for some endangered species as the fires spread. A fire in the Mesa Verde national park in Colorado, a popular attraction for British tourists, was only 5% contained, prompting concerns for the local research centre and museum which contains valuable artefacts. Firefighters were finding it difficult to reach the heart of the blaze. While lightning is thought to be the main cause of the fires, it is believed that barbecues and smokers who ignore the warnings dotted through the forest landscape are also to blame. Temperatures have also been at record highs in many areas. Possibly the oddest cause of a fire was noted just north of the Grand Coulee dam in Washington state. There a grasshopper that had jumped on to an electric fence and burst into flames was being blamed for causing a fire that has already covered more than 3,500 acres on the Colville Indian reservation, according to local officials.

More than 500 protesters gathered outside in spite of police warnings that even peaceful demonstrations were forbidden. Tian Chua, a leader of the National Justice party founded by Dr Azizah, was arrested. The judge said Anwar would serve the nine-year term after finishing a a six-year sentence imposed last year for allegedly trying to suppress the charges against him when he was still deputy prime minister. In spite of Anwar's characteristic defiance, he is now effectively removed from the political scene for good. Many Malaysians believe such an outcome had been the prime minister's objective ever since he decided that Anwar, who had been his chosen successor, was becoming a political threat. Within days of Anwar's arrest in 1998, Dr Mahathir claimed to have \"incontrovertible proof\" of the sodomy allegations. Defence lawyers pleaded in vain that the prime minister often committed contempt of court by publicly pronouncing Anwar guilty.

The US-based Human Rights Watch listed a series of legal irregularities including the severe beating of Anwar while he was in custody, and the attempted coercion of key witnesses - one was threatened with the death penalty for a minor firearms offence. Anwar's chief lawyer, Karpal Singh, faces trial for sedition over statements made in court while defending his client.

      "byline": "David Brindle",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Officially it's a crisis. Denise Platt, chief inspector of social services, has admitted that local authorities are having \"utmost difficulty\" recruiting social care staff and has accepted that many posts offer worse pay than do less demanding jobs in supermarkets. </p> <p>In typically trenchant remarks in her annual report, Platt warns that the government's drive to ratchet up the quality of social services will falter if recruitment and retention problems are not addressed. But she says low pay is only one of the issues that have to be tackled. </p> <p>Other problems threatening to hamper progress are that people who have been awarded the diploma in social work are \"said not to have the experience, skill and knowledge necessary to do the job\"; that too many apparently experienced workers seeking promotion are \"said not to have the competencies required\"; and that the government has sought to expand services in areas such as children and young people, and in regulation and inspection, without expanding the supply of staff. </p> <p>Training and qualification issues will be dealt with in the government's forthcoming consultation paper on social care quality. As social care minister John Hutton recently hinted, the paper looks likely to lay a path towards the three-year social work training that many in the profession have long campaigned for. But Platt is making clear that the onus is otherwise on local authorities. </p> <p>\"Councils responsible for social care services... need to consider how they develop, recruit and retain essential staff,\" she writes in the report. </p> <p>As she did last year, the chief inspector expresses concern about the assessment of people's care needs, which she describes as insufficiently rounded, the commissioning of appropriate services and the consistency of approach and delivery. Noting that more than one in three authorities has reconfigured traditional social services departments - linking, typically, with housing or education - she warns: \"Whatever arrangements are put in place, they must deliver a genuine difference for the many people who rely on social care services and not just be change for change's sake.\" </p> <p>The report, Modern Social Services - A Commitment to People, names the 18 English authorities put on \"special measures\" because of poor performance, although six of them -Buckinghamshire, Bury, Ealing, Kingston upon Hull, Newcastle upon Tyne and Sefton - have since made sufficient progress to be removed from the list. </p> <p>Platt says it takes two to three years to turn round a poorly performing authority, achieving acceptable standards and the necessary cultural change, and points out that, often, poor performance and chronic staffing problems go hand in hand. </p> <p>\"Some [of the 18] experienced social worker vacancy rates of 30% or more. Some had vacancies at senior management level, such that only the director of social services was in post; others had 'acting' arrangements in all posts in the senior management team, with a very thin layer of experienced people from whom to draw.\" </p> <p>In contrast to such criticism, Platt also uses the report to fight the corner of social services - not only by highlighting good practice, but also by pointing to failings elsewhere. </p> <p>Ministers, she says, have bemoaned the lack of joint working between social services and the NHS. Yet this is attributable sometimes to a multiplicity of mandatory planning processes, often overlapping, and sometimes to inconsistent boundaries for authorities and agencies. \"It would be helpful,\" she observes, \"when NHS bodies consider the reconfiguration of services and the progression of primary care groups to primary care trusts, if the impact on local partnership arrangements could be formally and explicitly addressed with partners\". </p> <p>Interestingly, Platt comments about problems in the NHS last winter that caused such trouble for the government. Social services has been blamed in some quarters for not doing enough, quickly enough, to ensure elderly patients were discharged from hospital when ready, leaving much needed beds blocked. But Platt says that \"the most significant reasons that can be identified for the majority of the delays\" lay elsewhere. </p> <p>These were: observing elderly people's right of choice to a specific care home; a shortage of care home capacity in some parts of the country; a lack of funding experienced by some local authorities; high levels of staff sickness; and, in some areas, the fact that \"people waited a very long time for discharge to other NHS facilities\". </p> <p>Foreshadowing an end to sniping between health and social care on this critical issue, Platt says: \"A national standard is needed for timely and appropriate discharges from hospital, particularly for older people, so that we can improve practice and resource development across the whole country to remedy problems. The Department of Health is already working on the production of a clearer definition for 'delayed discharge' and its causes.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Modern Social Services is available free from DH Publications, PO Box 777, London SE1 6XH</p>",

In typically trenchant remarks in her annual report, Platt warns that the government's drive to ratchet up the quality of social services will falter if recruitment and retention problems are not addressed. But she says low pay is only one of the issues that have to be tackled. Other problems threatening to hamper progress are that people who have been awarded the diploma in social work are \"said not to have the experience, skill and knowledge necessary to do the job\"; that too many apparently experienced workers seeking promotion are \"said not to have the competencies required\"; and that the government has sought to expand services in areas such as children and young people, and in regulation and inspection, without expanding the supply of staff. Training and qualification issues will be dealt with in the government's forthcoming consultation paper on social care quality. As social care minister John Hutton recently hinted, the paper looks likely to lay a path towards the three-year social work training that many in the profession have long campaigned for. But Platt is making clear that the onus is otherwise on local authorities. \"Councils responsible for social care services... need to consider how they develop, recruit and retain essential staff,\" she writes in the report. As she did last year, the chief inspector expresses concern about the assessment of people's care needs, which she describes as insufficiently rounded, the commissioning of appropriate services and the consistency of approach and delivery. Noting that more than one in three authorities has reconfigured traditional social services departments - linking, typically, with housing or education - she warns: \"Whatever arrangements are put in place, they must deliver a genuine difference for the many people who rely on social care services and not just be change for change's sake.\" The report, Modern Social Services - A Commitment to People, names the 18 English authorities put on \"special measures\" because of poor performance, although six of them -Buckinghamshire, Bury, Ealing, Kingston upon Hull, Newcastle upon Tyne and Sefton - have since made sufficient progress to be removed from the list. Platt says it takes two to three years to turn round a poorly performing authority, achieving acceptable standards and the necessary cultural change, and points out that, often, poor performance and chronic staffing problems go hand in hand. \"Some [of the 18] experienced social worker vacancy rates of 30% or more. Some had vacancies at senior management level, such that only the director of social services was in post; others had 'acting' arrangements in all posts in the senior management team, with a very thin layer of experienced people from whom to draw.\" In contrast to such criticism, Platt also uses the report to fight the corner of social services - not only by highlighting good practice, but also by pointing to failings elsewhere. Ministers, she says, have bemoaned the lack of joint working between social services and the NHS. Yet this is attributable sometimes to a multiplicity of mandatory planning processes, often overlapping, and sometimes to inconsistent boundaries for authorities and agencies. \"It would be helpful,\" she observes, \"when NHS bodies consider the reconfiguration of services and the progression of primary care groups to primary care trusts, if the impact on local partnership arrangements could be formally and explicitly addressed with partners\". Interestingly, Platt comments about problems in the NHS last winter that caused such trouble for the government. Social services has been blamed in some quarters for not doing enough, quickly enough, to ensure elderly patients were discharged from hospital when ready, leaving much needed beds blocked. But Platt says that \"the most significant reasons that can be identified for the majority of the delays\" lay elsewhere. These were: observing elderly people's right of choice to a specific care home; a shortage of care home capacity in some parts of the country; a lack of funding experienced by some local authorities; high levels of staff sickness; and, in some areas, the fact that \"people waited a very long time for discharge to other NHS facilities\". Foreshadowing an end to sniping between health and social care on this critical issue, Platt says: \"A national standard is needed for timely and appropriate discharges from hospital, particularly for older people, so that we can improve practice and resource development across the whole country to remedy problems. The Department of Health is already working on the production of a clearer definition for 'delayed discharge' and its causes.\" \u0095 Modern Social Services is available free from DH Publications, PO Box 777, London SE1 6XH",
