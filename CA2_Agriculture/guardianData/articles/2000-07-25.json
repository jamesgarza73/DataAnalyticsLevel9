In a bold and highly unpopular move, the boss of the town's municipal offices has just imposed a one-day-a-week ban on the use of computer equipment at work. </p> <p>The move, Ota claims, is intended to show staff how to work. \"Despite administration being human-contact work, there are a lot of young staff who mistakenly think that they are working by just sitting at their computers or word processors,\" he says. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, this has gone down like a lead balloon with the Hirata City staff who claim work will be left undone as a result. Writing by hand and communicating without email, they gripe, will be \"inefficient\" and waste paper. But Ota is not interested in their complaints. It was his own love of computers and his increasing reliance on them, he points out, that prompted him to impose the computer-free day. </p> <p>In our hi-tech modern world, such a step seems like self-inflicted torture. To most of us, wiping out computer use at work would be inconceivable to the smooth running of the office. But perhaps Ota is right. Perhaps our computer-heavy culture actually does do more harm to our work than good. After asking a handful of people to jot down a daily computer diary at work, it is tempting to side with Ota. A database software tester who spends most of his days glued to a screen relays part of his day: </p> <p> <strong> 9am</strong> Ease into the day with a strong coffee before booting up and checking emails in anticipation of some funny forwards to amuse me through my first half hour. </p> <p> <strong> 9:30am</strong> Headphones go on. MP3 server is activated so I can listen to music while working at pace through a report document in Word. </p> <p> <strong> 11.30am</strong> Casual surf of the internet to find details of last-minute bargain flights for my summer hols. </p> <p> <strong> 2.30pm</strong> Email attachments from friends start arriving. I have my work cut out playing with them and ensuring they are forwarded to appropriate parties. Gems include a \"How naughty are you in bed?\" quiz, the obligatory David Beckham joke and a string of cartoons about different nationalities' willies. </p> <p>And so on. This wasn't how it was supposed to be. When computers were introduced into our working lives, they were seen as the key to a hyper-productive workplace. But the promised benefits of increased IT investment have failed to materialise. Theories abound as to why what economists call the \"productivity paradox\" exists, but most users will admit that alongside computational privileges come distractions. Perhaps the endless technical problems or sheer irritation of being stuck in front of a monitor all day begin to take their toll. </p> <p>Take a sneaky peek at some of your co-workers and you might see why Ota has chosen to veto one of his favourite office tools. Those hands deftly gliding across the mouse pad may actually be succumbing to the latest edition of computer solitaire. But be quick or you'll miss it. These days, many computer games come equipped with a \"boss screen\" that pops up to deter probing eyes. Such in-built paranoia is there for a reason. Accountants Accpac International estimate that American businesses lose around $100bn per year to PC gaming. </p> <p>Likewise, electronic mail has proved a mixed blessing in the workplace. As well as the time-consuming replies to friends and colleagues, experts admit that email exchanges at work are rarely as productive as face-to-face conversations. \"Communicating via computer doesn't require you to interact with individuals,\" says Ivan Robertson, an occupational psychologist at UMIST. \"This means people don't interact on a social level, so it takes away the glue that keeps people bound together. The social signals of behaviour aren't seen by email, so you end up with people sending quite terse messages which are very bad for company morale.\" </p> <p>Interacting via computer, he says, involves a completely different set of social rules since people are more blunt and honest when they are not talking face-to-face. \"On the plus side, it can flatten the hierarchy and improve communication between different levels in an organisation. But there is evidence that people don't engage properly because computers take away a lot of the characteristics you need for a job to be satisfying - skill variety, control of a task and the identity people have with their work. When you are driven down this route, as call centre workers are, you end up feeling disempowered.\" </p> <p>This feeling can bring problems of its own. Cliff Saran, technical editor of Computer Weekly magazine, describes the experience of being busy doing nothing in front of his PC. \"People tend to be very reactive when sitting in front of a computer, so it's easy to find yourself just staring at it waiting for something to happen,\" he says. \"If you deal a lot with emails, you might be avidly awaiting one, but actually doing nothing but twiddling your thumbs until it arrives.\" </p> <p>He likens the numbness he sometimes feels in front of his computer to a sort of writer's block. \"Sometimes I've got a blank document open and I just can't get started because there's nothing, no prompts on the screen.\" </p> <p>UMIST professor Pete Makin has researched behaviour in email use and says: \"When they arrive, people find reading them more pleasurable than working, so it's a good excuse to leave what they're doing. Most organisations like to keep on the little noise emails make when they arrive, but it just puts people off their work.\" </p> <p>Robert Kling, professor of information science at Indiana University and author of Computerization and Controversy, has been debating the productivity paradox for some time. \"There has been a relentless promotion of computerisation as almost guaranteeing large productivity gains at work,\" he says, \"but the economic evidence doesn't bear that out.\" </p> <p>As people use computers continuously and intently, he argues, it is much harder for bosses to understand how and what work is being done. \"A lot of it looks the same these days - just people staring at a screen. In the days of paper mail, people walking past could see whether or not you had stuff to deal with. Now anyone casually casting an eye over your desk can't tell how much work you have to handle and what's urgent and what's not. Work has become much more privatised.\" </p> <p>As everyone sits transfixed in front of their own screen, \"go-slows\" are becoming harder to check. Our distracted database software tester admits at least half his work day lies in putting on a show: \"I face the people in the room I work in, so as long as I am looking at the screen and my hand is on the mouse, it looks OK.\" </p> <p>For that reason, it is harder to detect the time-wasters or distracted. Jeff Madrick, editor of the American economic journal Challenge Magazine, points out: \"People get preoccupied at work with all the different functions of their computers, partly because there are so many games to be played and so much information to be accessed, and because the office system is usually much faster than their system at home.\" </p> <p>He argues that a lot of people are attracted to the idea of thumping away at their computers as their contribution to the New Economy, but says they are actually not achieving much in the process. \"There is novelty involved in computer work - part of the interest is simply because these products are hot. A lot of the New Economy is just a big game for adults, a new, fun way of working.\" </p> <p>These distractions have their downside, Kling adds. \"Computer work can be very seductive, which isn't necessarily a good thing.

His deputy Trevor Newton famously claimed to wash in a kitchen bowl although later he admitted taking baths at his mother's home in water-rich Northumbria. The road back to respectability has been hard, and dogged by the original pre-drought line of attack by critics of privatisation: that a free resource of Yorkshire had somehow been taken away and sold. This ignored such things as water rates and the undemocratic nature of the old, appointed Water Authority. But it seemed to chime with Kelda's proposal of not-for-profit community ownership, on the lines of a mutual trust. However, yesterday's announcement will now merely join a long line of infamous headline cuttings.",

Even so, the riches on offer in Spain and the chance to play for one of the world's biggest clubs will almost certainly see him ending his turbulent but nevertheless successful stay in English football. Overmars's revelations during Euro 2000 that he was unsettled at Arsenal have given further credence to the belief that the 27-year-old winger would relish the chance to join the already considerable Dutch contingent at the Nou Camp. Figo's transfer caused so much interest in Spain yesterday that the sports daily Marca carried minute-by-minute updates on its website. The Portuguese winger is not the first player to move from Barcelona to Real but his popularity at the Nou Camp and the division it has caused between the two clubs provided Spanish football with one of its biggest sensations for years. Figo, 27, can look forward to banking \u00a33.74m a year until 2006 - double his wages at Barcelona - and his new contract incorporates a buy-out clause meaning any club that wants to sign him will have to pay \u00a3111.2m. His transfer breaks the previous world record (\u00a336m) set a fortnight ago when the Argentine striker Hernan Crespo moved from Parma to Lazio, but the money will be of little consolation to Barcelona's fans.",

However, if Smith does decide to give the Scottish striker the opportunity to return to Goodison, Ferguson's professed love for all thing Everton will be tested to the limit. </p> <p>He is currently one of the highest-paid players in British football, having signed a five-year contract worth \u00a39.5m when he left Everton in December 1998. If he wants to rejoin the Merseyside club he will have to agree to a deal which would see his weekly wage shrink from \u00a338,000 to \u00a320,000. </p> <p>Although Bill Kenwright, Everton's vice-chairman and guardian of the purse strings, recently insisted that the re-signing of Ferguson was not on the agenda, Smith declined to concur. \"Never say never,\" he said when asked whether fast-spreading rumour of a deal could safely be discounted. </p> <p>Ferguson is currently on tour with Newcastle in the United States but did not even make the substitutes' bench at the weekend for the 3-1 defeat by DC United in Washington. His chances of an Everton return have improved as he has slipped out of the Newcastle side just as Smith's search for a striker has floundered. </p> <p>With Kevin Campbell likely to miss the opening month of the season because of a knee injury, Smith has been unsuccessfully scouring Europe for a forward who can act as an old-fashioned target man for his array of new midfielders, Gascoigne, Alex Nyarko and Niclas Alexandersson. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Liverpool yesterday increased to \u00a35.5m their bid for Middlesbrough's Christian Ziege. The Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier has been searching for a left-back to replace Dominic Matteo and believes that the German international is the best available. </p> <p>Even if Middlesbrough reject the new approach, Ziege is rumoured to have a clause in his contract that allows him to speak to any club bidding more than \u00a35m for his services. </p> <p>Bryan Robson, the Middlesbrough manager, spoke to Ziege last week and seemed reassured that the 28-year-old German, signed last summer from Milan for \u00a34m, was happy to remain on Teesside. Ziege may, however, find the temptation of leaving Middlesbrough's Premiership makeweights in favour of Liverpool's championship challenge, where he would join his fellow German internationals Markus Babbel and Dietmar Hamann, impossible to resist.</p>",

Although Bill Kenwright, Everton's vice-chairman and guardian of the purse strings, recently insisted that the re-signing of Ferguson was not on the agenda, Smith declined to concur. \"Never say never,\" he said when asked whether fast-spreading rumour of a deal could safely be discounted. Ferguson is currently on tour with Newcastle in the United States but did not even make the substitutes' bench at the weekend for the 3-1 defeat by DC United in Washington. His chances of an Everton return have improved as he has slipped out of the Newcastle side just as Smith's search for a striker has floundered. With Kevin Campbell likely to miss the opening month of the season because of a knee injury, Smith has been unsuccessfully scouring Europe for a forward who can act as an old-fashioned target man for his array of new midfielders, Gascoigne, Alex Nyarko and Niclas Alexandersson. Meanwhile, Liverpool yesterday increased to \u00a35.5m their bid for Middlesbrough's Christian Ziege. The Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier has been searching for a left-back to replace Dominic Matteo and believes that the German international is the best available. Even if Middlesbrough reject the new approach, Ziege is rumoured to have a clause in his contract that allows him to speak to any club bidding more than \u00a35m for his services. Bryan Robson, the Middlesbrough manager, spoke to Ziege last week and seemed reassured that the 28-year-old German, signed last summer from Milan for \u00a34m, was happy to remain on Teesside. Ziege may, however, find the temptation of leaving Middlesbrough's Premiership makeweights in favour of Liverpool's championship challenge, where he would join his fellow German internationals Markus Babbel and Dietmar Hamann, impossible to resist.",

      "bodyText": "Concorde has been the pride of Britain's air fleet since the first model made its maiden flight more than three decades ago. The supersonic jet took off from the Aerospatiale airfield in Toulouse, France, in March 1969. Since then the fleet has logged more than 900,000 flying hours, two thirds of which have been above the speed of sound. And despite the technical advances that have been achieved, the jet is still considered the premier way to travel by passengers and pilots alike. The first Concorde, the 001 prototype, was a joint venture between Britain and France costing an estimated \u00a3950m. Britain and France started working separately towards a supersonic aircraft in 1956. They were working along such similar lines that in 1962 they decided to develop it jointly, a partnership that led to 20 aircraft being built. The second prototype, the British-built Concorde 002, made a successful maiden voyage from Filton aerodrome, Bristol, on April 9 1969. By November 1970 both prototypes had flown at Mach 2, twice the speed of sound. Concorde is powered by four Olympus 593 engines jointly developed by Rolls-Royce and the French company Snecma. Each engine is capable of producing 38,000lb thrust and powering Concorde at Mach 2. Concorde's first pre-production aircraft flew in December 1971 and the first production aircraft took to the skies two years later. On January 21 1976 the first commercial Concorde services were flown simultaneously by British Airways to Bahrain and by Air France to Rio de Janeiro. The aircraft had been subjected to 5,000 hours of testing by the time it was certificated for passenger flight. Air France and British Airways each operate seven Concorde aeroplanes. The supersonic aeroplanes can carry 100 passengers and fly at 1,336mph and at an altitude of 55,000 feet. But early hopes of selling the aircraft to airlines around the world came to nothing as the rising cost of oil and concerns about the amount of noise made by the plane led airlines to buy Boeing's 747 instead. Cruising at 1,350mph - twice the speed of sound - Concorde's typical NewYork crossing takes little more than three and a half hours. The record for a transatlantic crossing stands at two hours 52 minutes 59 seconds - at an average speed of about 1,300mph. The jet has an enviable safety record. But today's crash comes just 24 hours after it was revealed that a British Airways Concorde had been taken out of service after a crack developed in its wings. BA's other six supersonic jets also had cracks in the rear of their wings, but were been deemed \"no risk to safety\" by the Civil Aviation Authority and BA. BA has repeatedly said of late that there was no reason why its Concordes should not fly well into the 21st century - possibly remaining in service until as late as 2015. The aircraft has generally had an excellent safety record and only minor mishaps have bedevilled services until now. While BA was initially unable to comment on what future the plane now has, it is clear that serious consideration will have to be given to drastic action following today's crash. It is possible that BA could decide to ground all its Concorde fleet until it has concluded what caused the crash. Part of Concorde's excellent safety record and apparent longevity was due to the fact that the vast speeds the aircraft maintains means that it suffers less wear and tear in terms of flying hours than the more traditional \"workhorse\" Boeing aircraft such as the 747, 737, 757 and 767.",

A spokeswoman for the French national carrier said that \"microcracks\" had been noticed on the wings of four of the airline's six Concordes but added that this posed no risk to passengers. \"This is a phenomenon we have known about for a long time,\" said the spokeswoman. \"It happens in other aircraft as well and we have a maintenance programme in place to deal with the problem.\" The statement from Air France comes after British Airways grounded one of its seven Concordes last week when engineers discovered that small cracks in its wings had grown. The Air France spokeswoman said that while two of its jets were grounded for unrelated routine tests, there were no plans to withdraw any with wing cracks. This was a joint decision by Air France, the French civil aviation authority, and the wing manufacturers Aerospatiale, she said. Air France runs one flight a day from Paris to New York. A spokeswoman for British Airways yesterday said that several months ago engineers had identified 50mm-long cracks in the wing spar - a beam that runs inside the wing structure - of all its Concordes. After ultrasonic testing and talks with British and French aviation authorities and Aerospatiale, the jets were all deemed airworthy. \"That section of the spar is not a critical safety area of the wing,\" the spokeswoman stressed. But cracks in one jet, referred to as Alpha-Echo, were last week found to have grown to 66mm - over the maximum limit recommended by Aerospatiale - forcing the airline to ground it for repairs. Engineers plan to bolt a supporting sheet of metal over the cracked area and Alpha-Echo is expected to be back in service by September.

Indeed, the longer the contemplation the greater the appreciation of one of sport's greatest feats: the completion of golf's career grand slam by the age of 24. </p> <p>Woods inspires awe and incredulity in almost equal measure. His golf is everything that anyone could ever dream of and his achievements beggar belief. To have won so much, and of such quality, so soon sets the mind racing: what can this man do before his time is up? </p> <p>And when, indeed, will that be? Woods has set new standards in the game, not just in the quality of his ball-striking but in terms of physical and mental alertness, and it is tempting to say that should he desire to do so he can play to a championship-winning standard for another 20 years. </p> <p>An average of only one major a year for that period would take him to 24, well past Jack Nicklaus's total of 18 as a professional. But there are a couple of points arising from such a projection: one is that it all might become a bit boring and the other that Woods, by the very fact of raising standards, might be the author of his own shortfall in the longevity stakes. If the kids now aged about 13 realise they are going to have to \"stop eating the doughnuts\", in Nick Faldo's words, and get really, really fit for golf, then Woods himself may be overtaken sooner than he expects. </p> <p>As for boredom, it is significant that the atmosphere on the Sunday afternoon at St Andrews, and a month ago at Pebble Beach, was quiet almost to the point of somnolence. There was not the crescendo of excitement that normally attends the last day of a major because the old pros' credo of \"the tournament doesn't start until the last nine holes on Sunday\" was not being observed. Tiger was in the process of winning by eight shots after his 15-shot margin in California, and there is precious little in that to prompt a crowd to cheer. </p> <p>The simple fact is that excellence of itself is unexciting. Massive supremacy in any sport needs to be challenged or it becomes mundane: most people would soon get fed up with watching Manchester United win 15-0 every week, or seeing Maurice Greene win every sprint by 10 yards. </p> <p>Woods will not win every time because he does not sufficiently want to do so. Not that he would put it like that, but it is impossible even for him to concentrate constantly at championship levels, and subconsciously he will not be trying as hard in the routine tour events. As Jose Maria Olazabal put it when he won the 1999 US Masters almost solely on grit and determination: \"It is not possible to maintain that level of intensity for very long, or produce it very often.\" </p> <p>But Woods is certainly going to win a great many majors, and last week Nicklaus felt moved to repeat seriously a forecast he had made in jest before Tiger won his US Masters title in 1997. \"Tiger will win more green jackets than Arnold Palmer and myself combined,\" he had said. Now he has said it again; this time he means it and that, in turn, means more than 10. </p> <p>So what can be done to stop Woods? If we assume that he retains his desire then so far as the current generation of players is concerned the answer is not much, if anything at all. </p> <p>There has been a lot of talk about Woods \"raising the bar\" and as a result everyone would in future simply have to jump higher. But that assumes that players such as Ernie Els and Colin Montgomerie, Darren Clarke and Lee Westwood have the capacity to do so, that they possess reserves of talent and ability as yet untapped. And that is a huge assumption. Certainly Clarke and Westwood are overweight but would they, by slimming down, necessarily become better golfers? The weight of evidence, so to speak, is against it. </p> <p>Craig Stadler once lost 3st and found he could not play at all; David Duval has been on a demanding physical fitness campaign these past two years and not only has he not won a tournament for 15 months, he collapsed hopelessly over the last nine on Sunday, taking 43 to come home. A golf-fit torso was of no help to him then. </p> <p>There are a few likely lads but how close they can get to Woods is a matter for conjecture. Adam Scott, the Australian whose build is so like that of Woods that it is uncanny, can certainly play but although he has challenged he has not yet won a tour event, let alone come close in a major. His compatriot Aaron Baddeley won the Australian Open and is also a good prospect, albeit he is in the middle of a slump before his professional career has even started. </p> <p>Then there is Sergio Garcia, hugely talented but currently a victim of his own and his father's stubbornness. It is obvious to everyone but them that he has a flaw in his swing which was created out of necessity when he was a child and small for his age. In order to get length he needed to flail the club at the top of the backswing, so creating extra clubhead speed, like a whiplash. </p> <p>Because of his talent he was then, and still is, capable of delivering the club face to the ball in a square position - most of the time. But no one can get away with such a basic flaw all the time and the Spaniard's collapse at St Andrews typified the problem. He was challenging after rounds of 68 and 69, only four behind Woods, but subsequent rounds of 73 and 76 dropped him to joint 36th, down among the also-rans. </p> <p>He will need to acquire consistency if he is ever to put pressure on Woods with any regularity, but to ask him if he is going to modify his swing is to invite his wrath. His father, a professional, has been his only teacher and Sergio will change nothing unless Victor says so. So far there has been only silence. </p> <p>It really looks as if golf is going to have to accept the Woods dominance until such time as a whole new breed of player, perhaps 13 now, allies natural talent to a physical and mental training regime designed to get him to the top.

A good opportunity for a nap maybe, but also some breathtaking sporting initiatives that could change the shape of our country for the better! If only our fat kids could be bothered to do anything about it.</p> <p>This morning, the Koogster and Mr Tony indulged in a quick kickabout in the lush gardens of 10 Downing St (who knows, could be just a patio, the Fiver's never seen it) in order to commemorate the launch of the Football Foundation. Kind of like the Nobel Foundation, but with no awards for peacekeeping, the Football Foundation is to plough \u00a360m-a-year into grassroots football from the year 2001. The Premier League will help out with \u00a390m over the course of four years - roughly the size of the their bread roll budget over a similar period.</p> <p>75% of this lovely lucre will be spunked on improving playing surfaces, indoor facilities and buying equipment for 40,000 grassroots football clubs. Which fits in nicely with Koogan's long-term plan to blame anyone but himself for the failure of the England team. \"We haven't won anything since 1966,\" said Koogan, \"but that makes you even more determined to make sure that in the future we give ourselves that chance, that we do put facilities and coaching in place and we do organise.\" Interesting points each one, especially the coaching bit.</p> <p>If everything goes well, then, in five to ten years' time there should be a new improved generation of youngsters left to languish in the reserve sides of Premiership 3. Then again, as Brooking himself has mused, there may be absolutely no effect on a generation that would much prefer to kill each other through electronic simulation than on a muddy, hail-strewn pitch of a Sunday. \"Kids need to be taught the right things in their early years when they are impressionable,\" said Koogan today. But who would you trust to do it: him or Sony?</p> <p><strong>ADVERTISEMENT</strong></p> <p>Win a fantasy night for you and five of your friends courtesy of www.e-street.com - the essential new service for planning your shopping, eating and drinking in the city.</p> <p><strong>A MERE TRIFLE</strong></p> <p>After a day like yesterday, when Real Madrid smashed the world transfer record in controversial circumstances by paying their bitter rivals \u00a337m for Luis Figo, you'd think it'd be almost impossible to get excited about some minor transfer news involving Everton and Sunderland. And it is. Which is why we're going to see if a bowl of Granny Fiver's special caramelised sugar, Red Bull and crack trifle will make any difference.</p> <p>Wooah! Jesus! Take a look at this! Everton have paid German club SV Hamburg \u00a32.5m for Danish international midfielder Thomas Gravesen. That's amazing! It's taken Walter Smith's summer spending to almost \u00a315m, as well! \"I think we have replaced the lads who have left with some good players, and once they are allowed time to settle in I am sure they will all make a good impression,\" the Everton manager said! Today!</p> <p>And have you seen this about Sunderland? Peter Reid has bought 19-year-old Argentinian left-back Julio Arca for \u00a33.5m.

And, as always, his arrow landed with unnerving accuracy. \"Living in the south of England was not fair to me, the club, his team-mates or the fans who have supported him so loyally,\" harrumphed Ferg in the new version of his autobiography. \"Nor, in football terms, was it fair to him.\"</p> <p>\"There is no doubt he benefited from recognising more clearly that his apartment in Cheshire must be his working base,\" Ferg went on. Which may in some way have something to do with Becks' promise to stay in Cheshire during the whole of next season.

You see, some rat had told him that while Becks was at home with the baby, Victoria was out shopping in London. The wench! And so Becks was dropped from the game against Leeds.

      "bodyText": "NOBEL INTENTIONS Put Kelvin Koogan, Mr Tony Blair, Trevor Brooking and Premier League chairman Dave \"I love Danny Wilson, me\" Richards together, and what do you get? A good opportunity for a nap maybe, but also some breathtaking sporting initiatives that could change the shape of our country for the better! If only our fat kids could be bothered to do anything about it. This morning, the Koogster and Mr Tony indulged in a quick kickabout in the lush gardens of 10 Downing St (who knows, could be just a patio, the Fiver's never seen it) in order to commemorate the launch of the Football Foundation. Kind of like the Nobel Foundation, but with no awards for peacekeeping, the Football Foundation is to plough \u00a360m-a-year into grassroots football from the year 2001. The Premier League will help out with \u00a390m over the course of four years - roughly the size of the their bread roll budget over a similar period. 75% of this lovely lucre will be spunked on improving playing surfaces, indoor facilities and buying equipment for 40,000 grassroots football clubs. Which fits in nicely with Koogan's long-term plan to blame anyone but himself for the failure of the England team. \"We haven't won anything since 1966,\" said Koogan, \"but that makes you even more determined to make sure that in the future we give ourselves that chance, that we do put facilities and coaching in place and we do organise.\" Interesting points each one, especially the coaching bit. If everything goes well, then, in five to ten years' time there should be a new improved generation of youngsters left to languish in the reserve sides of Premiership 3. Then again, as Brooking himself has mused, there may be absolutely no effect on a generation that would much prefer to kill each other through electronic simulation than on a muddy, hail-strewn pitch of a Sunday. \"Kids need to be taught the right things in their early years when they are impressionable,\" said Koogan today. But who would you trust to do it: him or Sony?

A MERE TRIFLE After a day like yesterday, when Real Madrid smashed the world transfer record in controversial circumstances by paying their bitter rivals \u00a337m for Luis Figo, you'd think it'd be almost impossible to get excited about some minor transfer news involving Everton and Sunderland. And it is. Which is why we're going to see if a bowl of Granny Fiver's special caramelised sugar, Red Bull and crack trifle will make any difference. Wooah! Jesus! Take a look at this! Everton have paid German club SV Hamburg \u00a32.5m for Danish international midfielder Thomas Gravesen. That's amazing! It's taken Walter Smith's summer spending to almost \u00a315m, as well! \"I think we have replaced the lads who have left with some good players, and once they are allowed time to settle in I am sure they will all make a good impression,\" the Everton manager said! Today! And have you seen this about Sunderland? Peter Reid has bought 19-year-old Argentinian left-back Julio Arca for \u00a33.5m. Incredible! \"I spotted Arca playing for Argentina under-21s against England last season,\" Wow! \"He's an exceptional player and was possibly the best player on the field that night. I've had him watched ever since and we have been extremely impressed.\" Arca, who arrives from Argentinos Juniors, the club which discovered Maradona and Redondo, sounds pretty pleased as well. Brilliant! \"I am very happy to be coming to Sunderland,\" he said. \"I hope that I can win a place in the side and that we can win some trophies.\" We feel like dancing. Let's go to a club.

Barcelona representatives are due to arrive in London on Thursday to discuss the possibility of Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit moving to Spain. NEWS IN BRIEF Wolves striker Ade Akinbiyi has agreed terms on his record-breaking \u00a35m move to Leicester and will complete his transfer later today subject to a medical. St Mirren striker Junior Mendes has joined Dunfermline for a nominal fee. Liverpool have signed a \u00a320m deal with Granada which gives the media group rights to show delayed coverage of their matches on the internet, Wap mobile phones and through digital TV.

      "body": "<p><strong>Ancient clubs meet again - after 124 years</strong></p> <p>Two famous amateur cricket clubs are to do battle for the first time in 124 years. Next month's clash between the Free Foresters (FF) and I Zingari (IZ) will be their first encounter since 1876.</p> <p>The two clubs will face one another in the first International Millennium Cricket Festival for Wandering Clubs on August 9 on the beautiful ground at Christ Church, Oxford. \"There's so much excitement about this game,\" says Guy Beresford, the FF's match manager, \"it's unbelievable\". </p> <p>Quite why regular fixtures between the two, begun in 1859, ceased after the drawn two-day game at Walton Hall, Warwickshire, in August 1876 is not clear. There was no falling out. \"The main reason,\" says Beresford, \"is that we're both wandering clubs, without home grounds, who play most of our games against sides with fixed homes.\" </p> <p>Another club official says that, despite a considerable overlap in membership (Colin Cowdrey is one dual member), the two clubs \"never gelled\", and developed in different directions as cricket expanded. The FF, which still has strong military connections, went on to become much bigger, playing some first-class cricket until relatively recently; IZ, founded 10 years earlier, in 1846, has restricted itself to playing at schools, country houses and other spots on the \"jazz hat\" social circuit. Even in its early days, it was regarded as \"the Queen Mother of wandering clubs\". </p> <p>The festival, organised by The Cricketer magazine, brings together 28 clubs from around the world, among them the Gentlemen of Philadelphia, the Stragglers of Asia, the South Wales Hunts and the Wiltshire Queries. But no match will generate as much emotion as the FF-IZ game. </p> <p>Such is the enthusiasm of IZ members to be selected that the club suggested fielding 12 men a side, with only 11 batting and 11 fielding. The FF were unimpressed by the proposal, and will field only 11 players, some with county experience, whittled down from 25 applicants. \"We thought 12-a-side a silly idea,\" says Beresford, \"but still think we can beat them, even if they do field 12 men. However good they are, we won't be humiliated.\" </p> <p>It's just as well that sides in this most traditional of one-day competitions are playing solely for pride, and charity: there are no over limits, no places, and no prize money. And the FF have laid on a sponsored supply of 200 bottles of champagne to keep their guests happy. Says Beresford: \"Things could get very lively later on\".</p> <p><strong>Do of the Week (the sixth in an occasional series) </strong></p> <p><strong>Occasion</strong> The unveiling by the MCC Museum at Lord's, on Friday, July 21, of its latest commissions: portraits of Mike Atherton and Alec Stewart, by Andy Pankhurst, a conversation piece featuring Barry Richards, Sir Richard Hadlee and Clive Lloyd, by Andrew Festing, and a giant photograph of Nasser Hussain and Karen Smithies, by David Buckland. </p> <p><strong>Format</strong> Champagne and canapes, 6-8pm. </p> <p><strong>Attendance</strong> 70, led by Hadlee, who posed contentedly in front of his portrait during the formalities, Smithies (ditto), and Lloyd, who arrived just too late to do so. Also there: Peter Brooke, the cricket-loving former Tory Northern Ireland Secretary, plus a committee-room full of MCC names. Star of the show: Pankhurst's four-year-old son Josh, as blonde and charismatic as Shane Warne and thrilled that Atherton gave him the bat seen in the portrait. </p> <p><strong>Notable absentees</strong> Richards, Atherton, playing for Lancashire, and Stewart, who was expected but was too busy preparing for the following day's one-day final against Zimbabwe.

      "bodyText": "Ancient clubs meet again - after 124 years Two famous amateur cricket clubs are to do battle for the first time in 124 years. Next month's clash between the Free Foresters (FF) and I Zingari (IZ) will be their first encounter since 1876. The two clubs will face one another in the first International Millennium Cricket Festival for Wandering Clubs on August 9 on the beautiful ground at Christ Church, Oxford. \"There's so much excitement about this game,\" says Guy Beresford, the FF's match manager, \"it's unbelievable\". Quite why regular fixtures between the two, begun in 1859, ceased after the drawn two-day game at Walton Hall, Warwickshire, in August 1876 is not clear. There was no falling out. \"The main reason,\" says Beresford, \"is that we're both wandering clubs, without home grounds, who play most of our games against sides with fixed homes.\" Another club official says that, despite a considerable overlap in membership (Colin Cowdrey is one dual member), the two clubs \"never gelled\", and developed in different directions as cricket expanded. The FF, which still has strong military connections, went on to become much bigger, playing some first-class cricket until relatively recently; IZ, founded 10 years earlier, in 1846, has restricted itself to playing at schools, country houses and other spots on the \"jazz hat\" social circuit. Even in its early days, it was regarded as \"the Queen Mother of wandering clubs\". The festival, organised by The Cricketer magazine, brings together 28 clubs from around the world, among them the Gentlemen of Philadelphia, the Stragglers of Asia, the South Wales Hunts and the Wiltshire Queries. But no match will generate as much emotion as the FF-IZ game. Such is the enthusiasm of IZ members to be selected that the club suggested fielding 12 men a side, with only 11 batting and 11 fielding. The FF were unimpressed by the proposal, and will field only 11 players, some with county experience, whittled down from 25 applicants. \"We thought 12-a-side a silly idea,\" says Beresford, \"but still think we can beat them, even if they do field 12 men. However good they are, we won't be humiliated.\" It's just as well that sides in this most traditional of one-day competitions are playing solely for pride, and charity: there are no over limits, no places, and no prize money. And the FF have laid on a sponsored supply of 200 bottles of champagne to keep their guests happy. Says Beresford: \"Things could get very lively later on\". Do of the Week (the sixth in an occasional series) Occasion The unveiling by the MCC Museum at Lord's, on Friday, July 21, of its latest commissions: portraits of Mike Atherton and Alec Stewart, by Andy Pankhurst, a conversation piece featuring Barry Richards, Sir Richard Hadlee and Clive Lloyd, by Andrew Festing, and a giant photograph of Nasser Hussain and Karen Smithies, by David Buckland. Format Champagne and canapes, 6-8pm. Attendance 70, led by Hadlee, who posed contentedly in front of his portrait during the formalities, Smithies (ditto), and Lloyd, who arrived just too late to do so. Also there: Peter Brooke, the cricket-loving former Tory Northern Ireland Secretary, plus a committee-room full of MCC names. Star of the show: Pankhurst's four-year-old son Josh, as blonde and charismatic as Shane Warne and thrilled that Atherton gave him the bat seen in the portrait. Notable absentees Richards, Atherton, playing for Lancashire, and Stewart, who was expected but was too busy preparing for the following day's one-day final against Zimbabwe. He had popped in that afternoon for a private view of the finished painting; Atherton hasn't yet seen his. Main talking point The excellence of the work. It's highly unusual for MCC to honour current internationals - even those on the verge of their 100th Tests - but the studies of Atherton and Stewart, both depicted on the England balcony at Lord's, were judged a success.

      "body": "<p>With Aids there came health warnings on TV and talk of divine retribution: a health holocaust was on its way. Horrified contemplation of half-remembered flings became a national pastime. We whipped ourselves into the same panic over BSE, and billions of pounds were spent on research into both. </p> <p>But all that may soon seem like a storm in a teacup. There is a much bigger, seriously underestimated killer around, which has already infected 170m people worldwide - hepatitis C. Unlike Aids, it is just as likely to hit nice little Middle Englanders as prostitutes, drug addicts and homosexual men. Yet there are no signs of the health campaigns or government inquiries we might expect. </p> <p>Maybe it's all just too confusing. Hepatitis ranges through types A to E, all with varying degrees of severity - and there could be up to a dozen more types still unidentified. Maybe it is because the disease can take up to 30 years to have any obvious effect on health. Whatever the reason, the ignorance is astounding, even in the medical profession. Britain is ill-prepared to deal with what experts are calling a \"viral timebomb\". </p> <p>A survey of 5,000 women at a London ante-natal clinic gives a hint of what could lie in store: almost one in 100 were found to be infected with hepatitis C, which, extrapolated, would suggest up to 500,000 people across the country are carrying the virus. The report's authors, from St Mary's Hospital, London, are now calling for routine screening. </p> <p>Dr Graham Foster, a leading liver specialist at the hospital, says: \"There is no question there will be a huge epidemic of deaths - we're looking at anything up to 200,000 cases within the next decade. In the United States there are targeted screening campaigns. The French plan to identify 85% of sufferers by 2002. Here it seems we are all just hoping it will go away.\" </p> <p>Foster says most people developing hepatitis C today are in their 40s and caught it 20 years ago, when it was fashionable for students to dabble with intravenous drugs. Most people only tried them once - but that was enough. \"What makes it worse is that at that time we were short of blood and going round universities to get donations,\" says Foster. </p> <p>The disease is caused by a virus (called the hepatitis C virus, or HCV) which was not identified until 1989. It is thought to have existed for at least 4,000 years in Asia before jumping to the west after the second world war. </p> <p>Possible routes of infection are legion, including acupuncture, tattooing, ear piercing, sharing razors or dental treatment - some surveys suggest only a fifth of dentists use sterilisation techniques adequate to wipe out HCV. Occasionally it is passed on during childbirth and sex, but most of those at risk will have used intravenous drugs or had blood transfusions or clotting treatment before the early 90s. </p> <p>Unlike HIV, which can survive for less than a minute outside the body, HCV can survive for hours or even weeks. Patients can live for decades with no obvious symptoms, and tens of thousands of people in the first, acute, stages are probably being misdiagnosed - up to 40% of those diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome could actually have hepatitis C. Later on, however, 60% will develop severe liver disease, at least half of them cirrhosis or liver cancer. Once the liver starts to fail, it does so quickly. If a transplant liver cannot be found, the patient will usually die within six to 12 months. </p> <p>Although a combination of the drugs interferon and ribavirin can cure up to 40% of patients, many are denied the \u00a37,000 therapy by their local authority, often ending up with a choice between transplant or death. Transplants may cost more than \u00a330,000 plus \u00a37,000 per year in anti-rejection drugs, but - crucially - are centrally-funded. William Rosenberg, of the liver group at the University of Southampton, says the cost of treating hepatitis C over the next 20 years could reach \u00a39bn. \"We can make a huge dent in that by spending something now. We can do a huge amount more about hepatitis C than we can about heart disease or hypertension or diabetes.\" </p> <p>In the past, some patients have moved to different health authority areas to get treatment and beat the \"postcode lottery\". The loophole which allowed this has now been closed, however. Dr Foster says: \"It beggars belief that anyone can possibly justify depriving a patient of a life-saving treatment, which will also reduce the long-term burden of care and cost to the NHS - but it is happening. We're also going to run out of organs for transplant very quickly at the rate cases are increasing.\" </p> <p>The side effects of the drugs are so harsh that 20% of patients give up taking them, but John Bexon, 45, from Allestree, Derby, is one of the thousands who has been refused the chance even to try them. \"I had to give up my work in construction because I got so ill,\" he says. \"I've already cost the state a huge amount in terms of benefits and free prescriptions - never mind if I have a transplant.\" Bexon, who has tattoos and pierced ears, had several operations and was once an intravenous drug user, does not know how he caught the virus. It was detected in 1990 when he went to donate blood - worryingly, his 18th pint. </p> <p>Hepatitis C has taken a heavy toll on him. \"You get massive fatigue attacks which leave you unable to get out of bed for days. Sometimes you're too tired to even eat. I feel like an old man. I get headaches, I'm apathetic and depressed - in fact the psychological effects are as much torture as the physical ones. It's hard to explain how it feels to know that when your liver packs up there may very well be no liver available for transplant - and that you'll end up in a box.\" </p> <p>Therese Cronje, 51, who also found out she was infected after giving blood in 1992, has been free of the disease for almost three years after receiving the combination drugs. </p> <p>An employee of Barnet council in north London, she was offered treatment as part of an experimental programme at St Mary's Hospital, starting with interferon in 1995 and the combined drugs in 1997. She feels \"guilty and privileged\" to be cured. </p> <p>Like Bexon, she still has no idea how she became infected, although she grew up in West Africa and had two miscarriages and blood transfusions in the 70s. It could also have been something as innocuous as dental work or electrolysis. \"The fear when I found I was infected was incredible,\" she says. \"My GP had never even heard of hepatitis C. I bought a book about it for information, which basically told you to prepare for death. It wasn't exactly helpful to be reading about 'end stages'.\" </p> <p>The National Institute for Clinical Effectiveness (Nice) is reviewing the prescription of interferon and ribavirin, with a view to making them uniformly available - which it will probably do in November. \"But the real question is what will happen next?\" asks Dr Foster. \"Where will the money come from to pay for treating all the patients? Who will do the sophisticated virological testing? Most importantly, where is the strategy? </p> <p>\"We need central funding as we had with Aids, because if decision-making remains at local level, the health authorities still won't have the budget for the drugs, and patients will go on suffering.\" </p> <p><strong>A guide to the hepatitis viruses</strong><br>Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver which causes slow, long-term damage. It is generally caused by viruses, occasionally by other infections such as mononucleosis, yellow fever and herpes simplex. </p> <p>A, B and C are the most serious forms, and between them account for 75% of all chronic cases. </p> <p>Anyone with hepatitis should drink plenty of water and avoid alcohol, processed foods, saccharin, wild mushrooms, iron and excessive amounts of vitamins such as Aand B3. This will stop your liver working too hard, and give you some control over the progress of the disease and speed of recovery. </p> <p><strong> Hepatitis A</strong> <br> Spread by consuming food or water contaminated with the stools of an infected person. </p> <p>The virus can survive for four hours at room temperature in a speck of faeces on a nappy, hand or hard surface, and is most common in Latin America, Africa and parts of Asia. </p> <p>Risks include eating infected food, such as shellfish contaminated with untreated sewage, oral or anal sex, poor hygiene, intravenous drug use and eating vegetables fertilised with human manure (a common practice in China). </p> <p>Hepatitis A can worsen liver damage or even kill patients suffering from hepatitis B or C. </p> <p><strong> Hepatitis B</strong> <br> Spread by contact with blood and bodily fluids such as semen, vaginal secretions, saliva and open wounds. </p> <p>Risks include intravenous drug use, unprotected sex, sharing razors or toothbrushes, and problems during childbirth. Cancer patients and those on dialysis are at increased risk, as are people living in closed communities such as prisons, or those exposed to blood at work. </p> <p>95% of people fight the disease off themselves, but in America it kills 5,000 people a year, and one million are chronic sufferers who may go on to develop cirrhosis or cancer. In some states a child must be vaccinated before being allowed into elementary school. </p> <p>In experiments, woodchucks vaccinated against hepatitis B were also apparently immune to liver cancer. </p> <p>Hepatitis B is most common in the Pacific Islands and Asia. </p> <p><strong> Hepatitis C</strong> <br> Men, or anyone who contracts the virus over the age of 40, are most likely to develop serious damage. </p> <p>Hepatitis C is twice as common in southern, as compared to northern Europe, three times as common in the Middle East, and 13 times more common in North Africa. In Egypt 15-20% of the adult population is infected. </p> <p><strong> Hepatitis D</strong> <br> Cannot take hold in anyone not already suffering from hepatitis B.

      "body": "<p>Alison Dudley was 22 when a comment from a little boy at her local swimming pool sent her rushing off to the changing room in tears. It was the first time she had been swimming for as long as she could remember, and it had taken a great deal of courage to get her there. </p> <p>Alison is one of millions of Britons who suffer from acne and, until that day, she had been too embarrassed to display the rash of angry spots that covered the whole of her back and chest. </p> <p>\"I couldn't do much to hide the spots on my face, which first erupted when I was 12 and became the bane of my life, though I never displayed the rest of my upper body in daylight,\" says Alison. \"But when a couple of friends invited me along to the local pool I decided to take the plunge. I was sick of acne getting in the way of my enjoyment of life. Then, before I'd even got in, a little boy stared up at me and said to his mother: 'Mummy, look at that lady's back. What's wrong with it?' </p> <p>\"She tried to tell him as politely as possible that it was nothing and not to worry about it. But the damage had been done. I already felt self-conscious. After that, I wanted to die. I could have hit him for drawing attention to it. </p> <p>\"I should have been more grown- up about it. But at any age that sort of incident is very upsetting.\" </p> <p>Twelve years later, after having finally found an effective treatment for the pimples that blighted her earlier life (the drug roaccutane), Alison is chief executive of the Middlesex-based national Acne Support Group. She has two daughters, Jessie, seven, and Lucy, two, and, as acne is often hereditary, it was for their sakes that she initially became involved in the organisation . </p> <p>Around 90% of teenagers and adults have to contend with unsightly spots at some stage, and 15% require help from a doctor for clinical acne at some point. Even into their 40s, 5% of women and 1% of men still have big problems with spots. </p> <p>Acne is a skin disorder affecting the tiny pores and grease glands (sebaceous glands) most common on the face, neck, back and chest. During adolescence, rising hormones - specifically, male hormones found in both men and women - cause the sebaceous glands to get bigger. </p> <p>These glands make an oily substance called sebum, which reaches the skin by emptying through the openings of hair follicles. As a result the cells from the lining of the hair follicle shed more rapidly and stick together, forming a plug at the skin's surface. </p> <p>The mixture of oil and cells also helps bacteria in the follicles to grow, and these create chemicals that can cause the wall of the follicles to break. At this stage, sebum, bacteria and shed skin cells spill into the skin causing redness, swelling and pus. In other words, spots. </p> <p>Dr Tony Chu, a consultant dermatologist at Hammersmith hospital in London and one of the country's leading experts in acne, says that not enough people take the condition seriously. \"Acne leaves scars on the skin and the psyche,\" he says. \"And the psychological scars are as damaging as the physical. </p> <p>\"It usually strikes in puberty when children are just coming to terms with their sexuality and their physical appearance is very important. Along with the designer clothes they want a girlfriend or boyfriend but sadly acne very often results in poor body image and gets in the way of this natural development. </p> <p>\"I get lots of letters from people saying: 'Acne destroyed my life. I didn't achieve at school, I've never had a relationship and I can't get a job.' However sympathetic people might be, if it's a choice between dating or employing someone with acne and someone without most will opt for people with clear skin. Employers justify it because few people feel happy about being served in a restaurant or even being greeted by a receptionist with a face full of spots. </p> <p>\"And it's a disease we laugh at, many stand-up comedians have jokes in their routines about pizza faces or spotty dicks and this is very damaging for people who have acne. Although there are no hard figures, we know through experience that the suicide rate among acne sufferers is considerably higher than the population as a whole.\" </p> <p>In Dr Chu's view the biggest tragedy is that so many people are troubled for years with a condition which is \"totally treatable\". </p> <p>No treatment works for everybody, but there are hundreds available and it is simply a case of finding one that suits. Most take weeks or months to work. </p> <p><strong> Anti-bacterial lightbox</strong><br> The latest treatment on the market is a lightbox, Dermalux, which kills the bacteria that cause acne. It sends out red and blue waves of light, which zap the spots and heal the skin by, in effect, exposing spots to extra oxygen. </p> <p>The bacteria responsible for acne colonise in ducts in the skin. Because they are averse to oxygen, they breathe through a chemical, poryphyrin. </p> <p>The lightbox works in two ways. The blue light activates the poryphyrin in the bacteria which, once stimulated by the light, produces oxygen that overwhelms the bacteria. At the same time, the red light stimulates the white blood cells, which then produce fibroblasts, the building blocks from which new tissue is created, which in turn heal any abrasions. The lights do not damage the skin because they are outside the UV spectrum. </p> <p>In trials, the treatment worked for 75% of patients who, after 12 weeks, experienced a 76% decrease in the number of visible spots. There are also none of the side effects associated with some drugs traditionally used to treat spots. </p> <p>The downside is that the box has to be used for 15 minutes every day and, as the treatment is not available on the national health service, it costs \u00a3200. </p> <p><strong> Roaccutane </strong><br> One of a group of medicines known as retinoids which are derived from vitamin A, roaccutane is taken in tablet form daily, usually for four months. It works by dramatically reducing the formation of sebum in the skin. </p> <p>At the same time, it attacks blackheads and whiteheads, bacteria and inflammation. It can only be prescribed by a dermatologist, usually after several courses of antibiotics have failed to work. </p> <p>While the treatment has a very high success rate, in the initial stages it can exacerbate acne. It can also cause an increase in liver enzymes - so pre-treatment and follow-up liver function tests to keep levels in check must be carried out on all patients. </p> <p>As it can damage unborn children, roaccutane must not be taken in pregnancy. </p> <p><strong> Over the counter </strong><br> Many non-prescription acne lotions and creams help milder cases of acne. However, many will also make the skin dry if used too often. </p> <p><strong> Oral antibiotics </strong><br> These drugs include erythromycin, minocycline and tetracycline. It may be up to six months before you see the full effects, although there will probably be some difference after about six weeks. </p> <p>Oral antibiotics are effective in about two-thirds of cases of moderate to severe acne, and can safely be taken for a year or more. </p> <p><strong> Topical antibiotics </strong><br> Mild-to-moderate acne can often be controlled using antibiotics such as erythromycin applied directly to the skin. These treatments come in bottles with a special sponge applicator, and should be applied over all affected areas, not just individual spots. The treatment is not useful for treating blackheads or whiteheads. </p> <p><strong> Peeling agents </strong><br> Treatments such as benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin are effective against blackheads, unlike antibiotics, but can cause dryness and irritation. </p> <p><strong> Hormones </strong><br> Women with acne can be helped by taking Dianette. This contains the hormones oestrogen and cyproterone, which counteract the male hormone androgen. Over-production of this hormone is the main cause of excessively greasy skin in women, which can then lead to acne. </p> <p>Dianette is very effective for many women, and can be taken for many years. It is also an effective contraceptive. </p> <p><strong>Some common myths about acne</strong></p> <p><strong> Junk food causes spots</strong> </p> <p>Acne is not caused by eating chocolate, chips, pizza or any other food. Opinions from dermatologists on the importance of diet in the management of acne vary, but all agree that a strict diet alone will not clear up spots. </p> <p><strong> Too much sex causes acne</strong> </p> <p>While the sex hormone testosterone is the primary cause of acne, spots do not develop because you have too much of the hormone or are over-sexed. Neither sex not masturbation causes spots. In fact, as both are believed to reduce stress levels, they may also help alleviate the aggravating effect stress has on acne. </p> <p><strong> Spots are caused by dirt</strong> </p> <p>Acne is not caused by dirt. The black of blackheads is due to the pigment or colouring of the plug of \"sticky\" cells blocking the hair duct. Most people with acne wash more often than those without to clear away excess oil produced by their skins. </p> <p><strong> You should wash more with acne</strong> </p> <p>Over-washing can actually make acne worse by drying the skin and making it sore. Washing with mild soap twice a day is all that is needed. </p> <p><strong> Pregnancy cures acne</strong> </p> <p>While some women's acne virtually disappears during pregnancy, in oth ers the change in hormones reactivates an old condition or worsens an existing one. </p> <p><strong> Sun is great for spots</strong> </p> <p>Although sun may temporarily mask acne, tighten pores or dry up oil glands it also damages follicular walls, thereby clogging pores. This results in more acne which may not not surface for three to four weeks after exposure to the sun. </p> <p><strong> Acne is curable</strong> </p> <p>There is no cure for acne. However, through consistent use of appropriate treatments and remedies, it can be controlled or prevented. </p> <p><strong>More Information</strong></p> <p>The Acne Support Group can be contacted by phone on 020-8841 4747, by post at First Floor, Howard House, The Runway, South Ruislip, Middlesex HA4 6SE or via its web site, <a href=\"http://www.m2w3.com/acne\"> The Acne Support Group</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.aad.org\"> American Academy of Dermatology</a> <br> <a href=\"http://absoluteacneinfo.com\">absoluteacneinfo.com</a></p>",

She was charged with murder when eight-month-old Matthew Eappen died.</p> <p>Back home in the village of Elton, Cheshire, an appeal fund raised \u00a320,000 which was used to pay off the couple's credit card bills when they were in the US.</p> <p>A proper trust was set up as the British public opened their chequebooks and sent in more than \u00a3250,000 in donations.</p> <p>In April 1997 Mrs Woodward moved into a spare room at Ms Whitfield Sharp's home, where she stayed until October. Shortly before the trial the couple moved to an apartment near the Boston court paid for by Louise's au pair agency.</p> <p>Louise was convicted and imprisoned for second degree murder in October 1997, but the verdict was subsequently reduced to involuntary manslaughter and she was sentenced to the time she had already served awaiting trial.</p> <p>Mrs Whitfield Sharp, who originally comes from Merseyside, claimed she was told about the invoice by a journalist in June 1998, after an appeal fund trustee read in a British newspaper that Mrs Woodward had not been charged for her accommodation.</p> <p>At the Woodwards' Chester Crown Court trial, she said she would never have charged $2,200 a month to put someone up in her spare room, as the invoice alleged.</p> <p>\"That would be outrageous. It would be extortionate. That is more than our mortgage. It is way over the market value,\" she told the court.</p> <p>\"Apart from the fact that I wouldn't charge somebody to stay in the spare bedroom after inviting them into my home, I think $2,200 is an outlandish figure.\"</p> <p>The trial has heard vitriolic claim and counter-claim; Mrs Woodward said the lawyer was angry at not being allowed to make money by writing a book that 'dished the dirt' on the family.</p> <p>Mrs Whitfield Sharp denied this, claiming she had considered writing a general text on legal issues surrounding shaken baby syndrome.</p> <p>Mrs Woodward insisted she paid Mrs Whitfield Sharp for accommodation, and that it was the lawyer's idea to submit the invoice.</p> <p>The trial also revealed that the Woodwards were painstakingly thorough in drawing up their expense claims. Among the receipts submitted at the time of the rent claim was $6.80 for pet food for Louise's hamster and 50 cents for bubblegum.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The fraud allegations against Louise Woodward's parents were the latest and most venomous twist in a row which erupted two years ago after the former au pair sacked her American lawyer, Elaine Whitfield Sharp. A police officer who arrested the lawyer for drink-driving is alleged to have heard her say she no longer believed Ms Woodward was innocent. Mrs Whitfield Sharp and her husband, Dan added fuel to the flames with their claim that Ms Woodward's mother Susan had asked for $15,400 (\u00a39,100) from their daughter's appeal fund to pay for an extended stay at their home when they had charged her nothing. A police investigation was launched in 1998 and the Woodwards were arrested last summer. Louise Woodward's mother and father Gary regularly flew out to America to visit their daughter after her arrest in February 1997 when the baby in her care became ill. She was charged with murder when eight-month-old Matthew Eappen died. Back home in the village of Elton, Cheshire, an appeal fund raised \u00a320,000 which was used to pay off the couple's credit card bills when they were in the US. A proper trust was set up as the British public opened their chequebooks and sent in more than \u00a3250,000 in donations. In April 1997 Mrs Woodward moved into a spare room at Ms Whitfield Sharp's home, where she stayed until October. Shortly before the trial the couple moved to an apartment near the Boston court paid for by Louise's au pair agency. Louise was convicted and imprisoned for second degree murder in October 1997, but the verdict was subsequently reduced to involuntary manslaughter and she was sentenced to the time she had already served awaiting trial. Mrs Whitfield Sharp, who originally comes from Merseyside, claimed she was told about the invoice by a journalist in June 1998, after an appeal fund trustee read in a British newspaper that Mrs Woodward had not been charged for her accommodation. At the Woodwards' Chester Crown Court trial, she said she would never have charged $2,200 a month to put someone up in her spare room, as the invoice alleged. \"That would be outrageous. It would be extortionate. That is more than our mortgage. It is way over the market value,\" she told the court. \"Apart from the fact that I wouldn't charge somebody to stay in the spare bedroom after inviting them into my home, I think $2,200 is an outlandish figure.\" The trial has heard vitriolic claim and counter-claim; Mrs Woodward said the lawyer was angry at not being allowed to make money by writing a book that 'dished the dirt' on the family. Mrs Whitfield Sharp denied this, claiming she had considered writing a general text on legal issues surrounding shaken baby syndrome. Mrs Woodward insisted she paid Mrs Whitfield Sharp for accommodation, and that it was the lawyer's idea to submit the invoice. The trial also revealed that the Woodwards were painstakingly thorough in drawing up their expense claims. Among the receipts submitted at the time of the rent claim was $6.80 for pet food for Louise's hamster and 50 cents for bubblegum.",

Gary and Susan Woodward walked free after a jury was told to find them not guilty on charges of defrauding their daughter's appeal fund. The estranged couple breathed a sigh of relief from the dock as the jury foreman officially cleared the couple on the instructions of Judge John Rogers. The Woodwards, both 44, had denied defrauding their daughter's appeal fund of more than \u00a39,000. The judge said the crown had failed to prove that certain sums of money within the Louise Woodward and Family trust fund were not donated solely for the use of her parents.

By delivering his new book, bit by bit, via his website - and asking his fans to stump up for it.  John Sutherland  reports</p>",
      "byline": "John Sutherland",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On June 19 1999 the novelist Stephen King suffered a devastating accident. Walking along the highway outside his summer home in Lovell, Maine, he was run into by a wayward camper van. Bones were broken, and organs damaged. He was lucky to survive and will be maimed for life. Therapy may restore the partial use of his limbs, but can it mend his genius? </p> <p>For King, writing had always been as physical an endeavour as prizefighting. A bear of a man, 6ft 4in tall and 200lbs in weight, he turned out his fiction in what his fans called \"firestorms\"; three-book contracts (fulfilled in a couple of years) were commonplace. Stories rolled out of him like hot lava. </p> <p>King's fiction was as generously proportioned as its author. Hyped up by high-volume rock'n'roll (he owns the local radio station, WKIT 100.3), King consistently produced half a million printed words a year. He liked big books - works like The Stand which are the size of breeze blocks. And everything he wrote was a super-seller. He was the first author routinely to have a million-copy first print run. No novelist has had more millions from the publishers. And he makes even more millions for them. </p> <p>Above all, King seemed to love writing as a champion athlete loves his sport. Everything he did was infused with his exuberant energy. He had, in his time, used stimulants - alcohol and drugs - to drive himself to Stakhanovite levels of overachievement. But with middle age, the grace of God and the devotion of his wife, Tabitha, he conquered those personal demons. He worked as hard and productively in sobriety as he had in intoxication. Harder, even. Nothing could stop him - except two tonnes of out-of-control recreational vehicle careering down the high road. </p> <p>How, one wondered, would the trauma of being mashed into pulp affect Stephen King the writer? Could he ever be the same again? King's fans have been uneasy on the point. </p> <p>The line which was put out by King in his communiqu\u00e9s to his fans was that he would take a year's sabbatical after the accident and return to the fray, full time, in July 2000. That year is now up. It's showtime. </p> <p>No one could accuse Stephen King of lacking a sense of the dramatic. He rides back not merely with a new novel but with an attempt, singlehandedly, to overturn the whole American publishing industry. Stephen King has gone to war against the book trade. His new work, The Plant, is being released on his official website at <a href=\"http://www.stephenking.com\">www.stephenking.com</a>. Access is free. The narrative will be downloadable and - unlike his previous web novel, Riding the Bullet, which was read-only - The Plant can be printed out and passed on. </p> <p>The first instalment came out yesterday; the second (already written) is penned in for August 21. Each instalment comprises some 5,000 words. </p> <p>There is no purchase price or charge. Those who read or download the episodes are, however, bound by an \"honor system\". If they like what they read, they are required to kick in a \"buck an episode\" to King. \"Napster this ain't,\" King has declared. No freebies. If 75% of those who log in to the story come through with their dollar (the website can compute this precisely) a third episode of The Plant will be forthcoming in late September. If subscription stays \"strong\" the author will bring the novel to its conclusion in however many instalments it takes. As King puts it: \"If you pay, the story rolls. If you don't, the story folds.\" The initial response on the King website has been positive - but the crunch will be how many new subscribers are drawn in and whether they act honourably or not. Human nature being what it is, one has one's doubts. </p> <p>What is King playing at? Whatever else, the game is big. As he puts it, The Plant represents a whole new system of producing and distributing works of the imagination: \"My friends, we have a chance to become Big Publishing's worst nightmare. Not only are we going glueless, look Ma, no e-Book! No tiresome encryption! Want to print it and show it to a friend? Go ahead! There's only one catch: all this is on the honor system. Has to be. I'm counting on... plain old honesty. 'Take what you want and pay for it,' as the old saying goes.\" </p> <p>Publishing historians of the future will probably see The Plant as an interesting technical experiment - perhaps a breakthrough. In his July 11 announcement on his website, King claimed that with The Plant he was blazing a trail for the \"marginalized\" of the writing profession. Authors of the world can unite around him. </p> <p>No longer need novelists be in thrall to the stony-hearted publisher and bookseller. Thanks to King (assuming it all works out) they can post their works on the web and wait for the money to roll in from all those honest, kind-hearted readers. </p> <p>Philanthropy apart, King loves the new thing. He had an electric typewriter when everyone else was manual. He has experimented with film tie-ins, pseudonymy, audio tapes, and innumerable forms of author franchise. With The Green Mile, he quixotically revived the Dickensian novel in monthly episodes. Like Dickens, he made money with The Green Mile and cultivated his own version of make 'em laugh, make 'em cry, make 'em wait. </p> <p>King was also the first big-name author to venture into cyber-fiction, with Riding the Bullet, in March last year. It was so successful (perhaps because of the novelty, probably because of the irresistible lure of the King brand-name) that the delivery system crashed. </p> <p>Riding the Bullet demonstrated that there was a big market for popular fiction on the internet. And there are no great difficulties in the mechanics of online publishing. Difficulty presents itself when you try to collect. Within a couple of hours of Riding the Bullet going on sale, bootleg copies were available on the web. The cash flow stopped dead. </p> <p>It is impossible to sustain viable commerce if your product is saleable only for a few minutes after its launch. The web may be the future, but it is outlaw territory and private literary property isn't safe there. You can electronically watermark and protect images (it's tricky, but it can be done). You can protect software - or at least make it inconvenient to use unlicensed copies. But protecting words on the page, when there is no page, is like catching moonbeams. </p> <p>During his year off King has evidently come to the conclusion that the only way to create a revenue stream for the novelist (or any other dealer in words) from net publication is trust. Hence he has drawn up a contract, on his authorised website, with his fans. In his missive of July 11, he lays out - in quasi-legal clauses - what he as producer undertakes to do (write the damn thing) and what the consumer must do (cough up). </p> <p>The web will only work for creative artists when a new morality and new contractual relationships are evolved. As it is, the only cultural product that thrives is pornography. But even if King succeeds with The Plant, as he has succeeded with everything else, his is not an example which less addicting writers can hopefully imitate. If most novelists threatened never to write another word - unless that word were adequately remunerated - the reading public wouldn't give a toss. Like Charles Dickens, Stephen King is a Great Inimitable. It is hard not to suspect that King is mounting this elaborate scheme as a test of whether his readers really love him. Their dollars will be tokens of loyalty - \"love gifts\", as the televangelists like to call them. </p> <p>There is another test hinted at. Can Stephen King still work his old magic on his readers? Does he still have what it takes? Those dollars will tell him. If they roll in, they will do more for him than all the physiotherapists. </p> <p>There is another strange aspect to The Plant. It has been widely described as a new and original work of fiction, specifically written for Stephen King's comeback to active authorship. It is not. The Plant was begun (but never completed) as three short instalments of a story, issued on Christmas cards to King's friends in 1982, 1983 and 1986. </p> <p>King printed the works himself, under his Philtrum imprint. Only 200 copies of the fascicules were run off. The Plant fragments, as first produced almost two decades ago, are among the most sought-after collector's items in King's oeuvre - his Dead Sea Scrolls. Few have been privileged to read them and they have not (until now) been reprinted. But the general outline of the unfinished narrative has been described in the extensive library of commentary on King's work. </p> <p>Why, one may ask, would King go back to this early and discarded work now? He has had a fallow year (his first for decades). Could he not come up with something new? Even if The Plant is a huge success, it augurs ill that he should have exhumed this ancient piece of fiction. Has he dried up? Or is the old mastery still there? Pay your dollar and find out. </p> <p><strong>The Plant so far: a critic delivers his verdict</strong><br> Stephen King may claim the great Victorian writers of serial fiction as models for his own experiments, but it is from the 18th century that he has taken the form of his latest work. It is an epistolary fiction - a novel in letters - such as was all the rage over two centuries ago. It is set in the 1980s \"before e-mail, in other words\", as his own blurb emphasises. Published on a website, the story is pre-electronic. The characters write letters, memos, notes, all on bits of paper. The novel is nothing more or less than those bits of paper, collected together. What they reveal is at first amusing, but, by the end of episode one, is turning nasty. </p> <p>Most of the letters are written by John Kenton, a well-educated malcontent working for a lowbrow publisher. To start with, his notes to an equally disenchanted colleague are sardonic ruminations on the absurdities of the publishing industry. Once an English major at an Ivy League college and president of the university Milton society, he has plans to write serious novels but earns his living caressing the decidedly unliterary authors published by Zenith House. His memos make facetious allusions to Voltaire and Nabokov (Stephen King, an English literature graduate and former English teacher, enjoys his literary jokes). But his company publishes Rats from Hell, His Flaming Kisses and Gash Me, Darling. </p> <p>Kenton laughs at the creepy and absurd Carlos Detweiller, who writes proffering his typescript of True Tales of Demon Infestations. Maybe it is something that can be \"cut down and juiced up and sold to the Amityville Horror audience\". Of course, he should know that if you are looking for something to scare the gullible, you could end up scaring yourself. Oddly, Kenton seems not to have read any Stephen King novels, which often discover the powers of hell in what begins as just an average personality disorder. </p> <p>So the letters of Carlos Detweiller are aptly ridiculous rather than frightening. He's \"a ding-dong with delusions of grandeur\", as Kenton accurately puts it. From his ouija board he has found \"Demonic forces at work on HMS Titanic\" and \"There will be a President from ARKANSAS!\" (this is set in 1981, remember). He writes about attending covens and working in a flower shop. \"I am very good with plants\" - the sign of horrors to come (there is a hint that Kenton's fianc\u00e9e is a botanist, which will presumably be useful later). The humour is the best reason for paying one's dollar. Comic horror has always been a part of the King oeuvre. Misery, in which a novelist is terrorised by a truly fanatical fan, is a kind of satire. Christine, the tale of a car-loving nerd turned into a sinister destroyer by the 1950s saloon (\"Christine\") that takes possession of him, is deliberately hilarious. King's own website tells his followers that The Plant will be \"funny and at the same time pretty gruesome\". \"Think Christine,\" it advises. </p> <p>What is mildly appealing about this first instalment of The Plant is that sense of the funny becoming the not-so-funny, the oddbod becoming a monster. It is a horror book that mocks someone making a living from such stuff. Detweiller is a laughable eccentric, but rejected authors can turn nasty (Kenton provides droll anecdotes of such things). And those photos that he sends with his ill-written typescript do seem to show something truly terrible... </p> <p>Yet that's the trouble. Things are destined to become serious. When they do, what redeems the story will be lost, even if paid-up King followers (net surfers all) will be happily reading on.</p>",

Since the 1950 election, the Liberal, Donald (later Lord) Wade, had held the seat without facing a Tory opponent.</p> <p>The moment it became a three-cornered fight, Lomas beat Wade by 1,280 votes (with the help of the candidacy of a clever Tory public relations man, John Addey, who came a close third). In the 1966 election, an up-and-coming young Yorkshire rightwinger, Marcus Fox, came second by 4,476 votes.</p> <p>Lomas was a most suitable candidate for such a target seat. He was born in Ashton-under-Lyne, the son of George Lomas, a Co-op store manager, and Helen Clayton. Educated at the local elementary and central schools, he went to work at the age of 14 as an office boy for the shopworkers' union, Usdaw. He began his political life in the Independent Labour Party.</p> <p>During the war he qualified as a sergeant in the Royal Marines, and won the Italian Star during the fighting in Salerno before his unit was shipped to south-east Asia.</p> <p>After demobilisation, he went back to work for Usdaw, married Helen Wilson, a munitions worker, and, with his family, settled in Wilmslow, Cheshire, where he became a justice of the peace. In 1965, he became assistant regional organiser of the Blood Transfusion Service for Manchester.</p> <p>Lomas had made his political ambitions clear early on. He fought Blackpool South in 1951 and hopeless Macclesfield in 1955. When he showed an interest in Huddersfield West in 1962, the selectors may have thought his limpid brown eyes and dark skin would persuade Asian workers in Huddersfield's woollen mills that he was part-Indian, helping to push fellow-aspirant Betty Boothroyd into second place.</p> <p>Yet without his wife on hand to provide him with stability, he never settled in at the Commons. He was an active constituency man and party loyalist, but was sometimes unpredictable, even lashing out against immigration.</p> <p>He served widely on select and specialist committees, but the highest point he reached on the greasy pole was in 1969, when he worked for a year as parliamentary private secretary to Tony Benn, then minister for technology.

She is also England's most senior player and she scored 231 runs at 57.75 in the one-day series against South Africa in June. She is resigning from the ECB at the end of this season so that she can concentrate on playing cricket. </em></p> <p> <strong>When did you decide to resign from the ECB? </strong><br> I had decided in my mind before the South Africa series, though I didn't do anything about it. But suddenly scoring runs once I'd made the decision confirmed that it was the right thing to do. </p> <p><strong>Why? </strong><br> The Australian series was a bit of a disaster. [In six games she made 34 runs at 5.66, with a highest score of 19.] I felt I was doing neither my cricket nor my job at the ECB justice, and I decided that if I wanted to continue playing for England I had to put my whole heart into it. </p> <p><strong>Was it a hard decision? </strong><br> It wasn't easy because I've enjoyed working at the ECB and they've been very good employers and very understanding about my cricket commitments. I have days when I think, what have I done? But then I remember how relaxed I felt during the South Africa series. </p> <p><strong>Who did you discuss your decision with? </strong><br> Essentially I came to the decision by myself. I didn't want to alert too many people to what I was thinking. But I did speak to Paul [Farbrace, the coach] and Joce Brooks [England's psychologist] about what my future cricket career might hold. I still felt that I had something to offer if I could get myself back into form, but I realised that I had to reassert myself back into the team and in my own mind. </p> <p><strong>How will you support yourself? </strong><br> I'm a teacher [of English to secondary-school pupils] by profession so I know that I can always do supply work if necessary. And I won't be lost to cricket - I'm sure I'll end up on some committee somewhere. </p> <p><strong>Will you get paid for going on tour? </strong><br> The ECB have given the players something on the last two tours and we are waiting on news of a lottery bid. Things are looking fairly hopeful. But whatever happens we're guaranteed to have our expenses paid. It's a wholly different world to when I first started. </p> <p><strong>Do you feel that there is a conflict of interest in being both a player and an administrator? </strong><br> Not as far as I am concerned. But my job has grown a lot in four-and-a-half years so it has become increasingly difficult to combine it with playing. Cricket has grown harder too. We never used to play every year and, of course, as I've got older I've had to train harder. </p> <p><strong>Do you feel satisfied with the job you've done? </strong><br> I became the first full-time executive director of the Women's Cricket Association in February 1996, and it very quickly became apparent that unless we worked more closely with the ECB we weren't going to go anywhere. The merger wasn't an easy thing to do and a lot of people needed convincing. And understandably so - it was a leap of faith. But it has made women's cricket far healthier and is good for the game full stop. There is still an awful lot to do but it's been a very exciting time to be involved with women's cricket. </p> <p><strong>Marion Collin, the England scorer, said she'd never seen you bat as well as you did during the South Africa series. Do you agree? </strong><br> It is nice of people to say that. Certainly I felt back to something like my best form. I was lots more relaxed and lots more positive, and I thoroughly enjoyed it which is the key. I hope it is a sign of things to come. New Zealand and Australia really knocked the confidence out of us. Not just me, but the whole side. </p> <p><strong>How long will you play on for? </strong><br> The World Cup and then I'll see. There are a lot of youngsters coming up who need some experienced people around, like this old girl. I'll play as long as I can. You're a long time retired as they say. </p> <p><strong>Are people more enthusiastic about watching women's cricket than they used to be? </strong><br> At Canterbury [the third one-day international] we had over a thousand people watching and at Taunton [the fourth] it was between two and three thousand which was great, though I still think we should be looking to get five thousand people at our games. People are not always keen to come, but once they do they are very, very impressed. It is important for girls to see women playing cricket. There were loads of kids at Taunton, and two girls were overheard discussing who they wanted to be. One said, \"I'll be Clare Connor, the batswoman.\" That is great. </p> <p><strong>Have things changed? </strong><br> Yes. In the last four or five years there has been a sea change in the general attitude to women and sport. It is seen as acceptable and normal. Girls in cricket are now demanding things from development officers. I think Kwik Cricket has made a real difference, it is a positive, fun, experience. And because of the merger all the county sides have had to take notice of women's cricket. They might have been hesitant to start with but then they realised the commercial value. The money is not to be sniffed at. </p> <p><em>Tanya Aldred is assistant editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly</em></p> <p><em>To read last week's Women's Page, in which we meet Marcus Trescothick's girlfriend, <a href=\"http://www.wisden.com/Story_Co_Brand/0,5642,344660,00.html\">click here</a>.</em></p>",

I became the first full-time executive director of the Women's Cricket Association in February 1996, and it very quickly became apparent that unless we worked more closely with the ECB we weren't going to go anywhere. The merger wasn't an easy thing to do and a lot of people needed convincing. And understandably so - it was a leap of faith. But it has made women's cricket far healthier and is good for the game full stop. There is still an awful lot to do but it's been a very exciting time to be involved with women's cricket. Marion Collin, the England scorer, said she'd never seen you bat as well as you did during the South Africa series. Do you agree? It is nice of people to say that. Certainly I felt back to something like my best form. I was lots more relaxed and lots more positive, and I thoroughly enjoyed it which is the key. I hope it is a sign of things to come. New Zealand and Australia really knocked the confidence out of us. Not just me, but the whole side. How long will you play on for? The World Cup and then I'll see. There are a lot of youngsters coming up who need some experienced people around, like this old girl. I'll play as long as I can. You're a long time retired as they say. Are people more enthusiastic about watching women's cricket than they used to be? At Canterbury [the third one-day international] we had over a thousand people watching and at Taunton [the fourth] it was between two and three thousand which was great, though I still think we should be looking to get five thousand people at our games. People are not always keen to come, but once they do they are very, very impressed. It is important for girls to see women playing cricket. There were loads of kids at Taunton, and two girls were overheard discussing who they wanted to be. One said, \"I'll be Clare Connor, the batswoman.\" That is great. Have things changed? Yes. In the last four or five years there has been a sea change in the general attitude to women and sport. It is seen as acceptable and normal. Girls in cricket are now demanding things from development officers. I think Kwik Cricket has made a real difference, it is a positive, fun, experience. And because of the merger all the county sides have had to take notice of women's cricket. They might have been hesitant to start with but then they realised the commercial value. The money is not to be sniffed at. Tanya Aldred is assistant editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly To read last week's Women's Page, in which we meet Marcus Trescothick's girlfriend, click here.",

While the government has repeatedly stressed its commitment to repeal the clause, any attempt to tack the measure onto another bill in the Queen's Speech in November is likely to be met with the same response in the Lords, forcing long delays in the legislative process and making it highly improbable that any change could be implemented within this parliament.</p> <p>Ministers are instead expected to make a manifesto commitment to repeal section 28 so that if the measure is defeated in the Lords again, despite the government's mandate, ministers can invoke the Parliament Act to force through the change.</p> <p>The bill has had a difficult passage through parliament. The Lords threw out an attempt by ministers to repeal section 28 in February by a majority of 54 but that decision was later overturned by the government's huge majority in the Commons.</p> <p>Since then Mr Blair has created 30 new Labour and Liberal Democrat life peers, but still only a third of peers are government supporters.</p>",

An alliance of Tory and crossbench peers blocked repeal of the controversial legislation, which was introduced by Margaret Thatcher's government, by 270 votes to 228, a majority of 42. Although government officials refused to admit that Tony Blair will be forced to drop the disputed clause this side of the general election, the prime minister risks losing the important local government bill - which contains the clause - as well as other legislation if he tries to face down the recalcitrant peers on this highly emotional issue. Ministers now look set to disappoint gay rights campaigners by agreeing to postpone legislation until after the next general election. The fate of the clause, which forbids local authorities from \"promoting\" homosexuality in schools, was decided after a highly charged debate in a packed Lords chamber on the bill, which also includes measures to reform local government by creating directly elected mayors and cabinets. The decision to abandon the measure will infuriate supporters of gay rights, who fear that the prime minister has caved in to pressure from rightwing newspapers which have campaigned vigorously to defeat the bill. Last night's vote came after a memo was leaked last week in which Mr Blair revealed his concern that Labour's stance on homosexual rights and \"gay issues\" had made it look \"weak\" on the family. Last month, the Scottish parliament voted to repeal section 28 despite the efforts of the Stagecoach boss Brian Souter, who funded a referendum designed to show opposition to the repeal of the measure. During the Lords debate, Baroness Young, the former Tory leader of the Lords and \"family values\" campaigner who has led the rebellion, appealed to the peers to \"speak for the majority of the British people\" in voting to protect youngsters from the \"appalling material\" on gay and lesbian lifestyles that would inevitably find its way into the classroom if the government had its way. But the local government minister Lord Whitty said many people had been misled into thinking that section 28 applied to schools, adding: \"Local authorities provide a number of services to gay and lesbian people, health and medical advice, social and counselling services. \"It must be right that local authorities should be able to continue to do that, without running into the danger of being accused of promoting homosexuality under section 28.\" Despite the controversy that has raged on all sides since section 28 was introduced by Margaret Thatcher's government as part of the 1988 Local Government Act, no council has been prosecuted for breaching it, although it has been invoked more than 30 times to prevent local authority activities. After last night's vote, the immediate future of the bill was unclear. While the government has repeatedly stressed its commitment to repeal the clause, any attempt to tack the measure onto another bill in the Queen's Speech in November is likely to be met with the same response in the Lords, forcing long delays in the legislative process and making it highly improbable that any change could be implemented within this parliament. Ministers are instead expected to make a manifesto commitment to repeal section 28 so that if the measure is defeated in the Lords again, despite the government's mandate, ministers can invoke the Parliament Act to force through the change. The bill has had a difficult passage through parliament. The Lords threw out an attempt by ministers to repeal section 28 in February by a majority of 54 but that decision was later overturned by the government's huge majority in the Commons. Since then Mr Blair has created 30 new Labour and Liberal Democrat life peers, but still only a third of peers are government supporters.",

The judge ruled that the committee was right and within its powers to insist the ban should be lifted.</p> <p>But the Home Office document says \"there seems to be a general public perception that the committee is unrepresentative and unaccountable\" and reports that its system of appointments is not \"as open as contemporary standards require\".

      "bodyText": "Jack Straw last night vented his anger at a high court ruling legalising the sale of sexually explicit videos in Britain by proposing to abolish the independent watchdog that passed them for sale in adult-only licensed sex shops. The home secretary proposes to replace the independent video appeals committee - which includes writers such as Fay Weldon, Nina Bawden, and Claire Rayner, as well as legal and child welfare experts - with a body appointed by the government. Mr Straw last night claimed there was evidence that paedophiles \"sometimes used this sort of material to 'groom' children for sexual abuse\", which, he said, justified the ban on the sale of videos showing consensual adult sex. In a Home Office consultation paper published last night, Mr Straw also proposed to overturn the high court decision by introducing two new offences of showing a classified R18 video to a child and \"failing to prevent a child from watching an R18 video\", which would carry a prison sentence of up to six months or a fine of \u00a320,000. It also proposes to increase fines to a minimum of \u00a320,000 for selling such videos by mail order, and to increase the maximum penalty, for selling such videos, to two years in prison. The Home Office also said last night that a communications white paper to be published later this year will propose internet obscenity laws. The consultation paper on videos acknowledges that there is \"little conclusive evidence of the harmful effects\" of such films that show consensual explicit adult sex, and that the high court judges had ruled that the risk of the videos being seen by children and causing them harm was, on present evidence, insignificant. The Home Office paper says that the videos at issue are less explicit than those available in much of Europe and can only be bought in 90 licensed sex shops or by mail order. The high court battle followed a decision by the video appeals committee to overrule a ban last year by Andreas Whittam Smith's British Board of Film Classification on seven sexually explicit videos. The judge ruled that the committee was right and within its powers to insist the ban should be lifted. But the Home Office document says \"there seems to be a general public perception that the committee is unrepresentative and unaccountable\" and reports that its system of appointments is not \"as open as contemporary standards require\". The document also says that its membership does not \"reflect the diversity required\". The Home Office says it wants to see in the video appeals committee \"a proper balance in the membership to include senior lawyers who may be specialists in child welfare\". The chairman of the watchdog, John Wood, is a former deputy director of public prosecutions, and the members include the chairman of the national children's bureau. Claire Rayner, the writer and agony aunt, sits on the committee. She said: \"I expected this to happen. We are outspoken. We do not toe any party line. We are reasonably liberal and several of us are involved in the welfare of children. It certainly seems a vindictive action by Jack Straw.\" Mr Straw said last night: \"I was disappointed with the high court decision in May which dismissed the British Board of Film Classification's application for judicial review. The government has a clear and determined commitment to protect children from unsuitable sexually explicit material.\" Mr Whittam Smith welcomed Mr Straw's proposals saying he shared the home secretary's concern: \"I am very pleased that the home secretary is considering a range of options for strengthening the protection of children from exposure to sexually explicit videos.\"",

If that happens to be Manchester, there's every chance that the nation's most on-the-ball mob - who got to the man they took to be their beast in a record six hours on the Sunday of publication - will put an end to his wandering for good.

Of course, I know they lie but somehow that is now so well established that it stops me from being shocked at any specific example. This Sunday was an exception. My objections to Rebekah Wade's efforts to make her mark as the News of the World's new editor all proceeded from the thought of her sitting there one night at her computer, trying to work out how to reinvigorate her brand. I pictured her thinking her \"naming and shaming\" campaign through, weighing up the pros (massive publicity, increased sales and, most importantly, the tangible proof that she means business) against the cons (bad press, some political flak and a couple of whingeing liberal editorials). On that basis, it's no wonder she went for it. If you exclude the human consequences of publishing the paedophile register, it looks like a fantastic idea. With negligible journalistic effort and little financial outlay, the News of the World gets on the TV news as the \"paper at the heart of the controversy\" and Wade moves a step closer to her ambition to be the first woman to edit a daily tabloid. </p> <p>The only potential problem with this plan was the danger that some dense souls might misuse the beast list for purposes other than \"knowledge\" and that these same individuals might well prefer to pour petrol through the letterboxes of their chosen pervert than just stick their faces up on the fridge. But given that Wade is, by all accounts, a very intelligent woman, it is fair to assume that she had no inkling that the information she was providing would fall into the hands of her readers. The fact that some people ignored the News of the World's warnings against vigilantism - \"We do not want our readers to take any action\" - and plumped instead for its injunctions to take steps to protect \"our children\" - \"We say again. It is time for action\" - has many reverberations in which Wade and her colleagues are in no way implicated. </p> <p>\"The rule of law is crucial and outbursts of uncontrolled anger will solve nothing.\" According to the News of the World's editorial, the only proper response to discovering a beast in your midst is to forget you found him. Under \"What to do if there is a pervert on your doorstep,\" readers are warned against leaving their children unattended in dark alleys - which is odd. You're going to look after your children whether or not the pervert is a clear and present danger. Which rather puts the dampeners on the idea that the list has any legal uses. It doesn't. The only things you can do with the name and address of someone you believe to be evil incarnate are a) call him up and tell him what you think of his lifestyle, b) send him something vile in the post or c) pay him a visit on the way back from the pub one evening. </p> <p>The News of the World knows this. The key editorial pages are peppered with the language of pursuit. It is \"scouting out the beasts\", it says, encouraging us to \"catch 'em on the web\". It's hard not to think of Pok\u00e9mon's \"gotta catch them all\" when you hear that the NoW will dribble out names \"week by week\". In order to get the set, you have to keep on buying. </p> <p>Exactly how the pub- lication of the photographs of free men will impact on the rulings on those who have yet to be sentenced is a mystery. Nor is it clear how a campaign can be effective if nothing is demanded of its supporters. If we agree with Sarah Payne's mother that the way to deal with paedophiles is simply to \"put them in prison and let them die there\", what can we do about it? There isn't any cut-out postcard to send to your MP, nor any single suggestion as to how the average person can help ensure that \"life means life\". In this sense, the NoW campaign is not a campaign at all but a call for consumer action which bypasses politics in favour of a brokered relationship between public and errant quarry. </p> <p>The paedophiles have been run down by the media acting on the people's behalf. In this scenario, the papers are the law enforcers and their mandate from the public (88% in a Mori poll agreed with naming and shaming) allows them to effect change directly, instead of pressuring government. That's why there's no need to write to your MP. Your support has been sought, via Mori, for the NoW's strategy and it is intending to use that as a government would use its electoral mandate. It's particularly easy to do this around law and order since New Labour made it a consumer issue. No longer concerned with the impact of crime on society, the focus has shifted to the impact of the criminal on the victim. The effect of allowing victims of crime to present their testimonies in court has been to reduce the issue to a stand off between two individuals - abuser and abused. </p> <p>As long as this trend continues, tabloid editors will be able to exploit it and no one will be accountable for what happens.

The 41-year-old handyman is accused of stealing a car and ramming several other vehicles during a chase through the Langley Green area of Crawley, West Sussex. The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had been bailed to his father's home in the area after being questioned for more than 60 hours, beginning the day after eight-year-old Sarah went missing on July 1. Both he and his father left the address last week after it was surrounded by vigilantes who threw a stone through one of the rear windows. Sussex police declined to say where they had gone but last night they confirmed that the younger man had been arrested after the alleged theft of a Vauxhall Nova hatchback and a high speed chase in the early hours of Sunday. The man has been arrested and charged with theft, assault and aggravated vehicle taking. He appeared at Crawley magistrates court yesterday and was remanded in custody for seven days. Forensic tests have quashed hopes that blue scraps of cloth found at a ruined Norman castle might be from the dress Sarah was wearing when she disappeared. But tests are continuing on a shoe, the only piece of Sarah's clothing to be found so far. Detectives hope it could provide a vital DNA clue to the identity of the killer. Police are also concentrating on finding a white van seen when Sarah disappeared near her grandparents' home in Kingston Gorse, near Littlehampton. They have taken the decision to scale down media appeals in order to concentrate on existing leads, but are considering an appeal on BBC TV's Crimewatch, due to broadcast later this week. A spokesman for Sussex police said a that second postmortem examination on Sarah's body was due to be performed this week to find out the exact cause of death. No obvious signs of violent injury were found on the body but it is thought she may have been strangled or suffocated.",

      "bodyText": "Public support for Britain's membership of the European Union has plunged to its lowest level in 20 years, with just a quarter of the population convinced that it is a good thing, a new poll from the European commission showed yesterday. In a survey likely to delight Eurosceptics and depress the government, the figures also reveal that the public's enthusiasm for joining the single currency has fallen away dramatically and is languishing at a three-year low. Britain is outed as the most Eurosceptic country in the 15-nation EU, with the most negative view on six of the most important questions asked of the 16,000 Europeans who were polled in April and May. Only 25% of Britons said they thought that UK membership of the EU was a positive thing, compared with the heady days of 1991 when the same survey found that 58% of the public felt positive about Brussels. According to the commission's spokesman, Christophe Forax, the poll marks a new ebb in the UK's attitude towards Europe and tops a pre vious all-time low in support of EU membership of just 29% in 1993. \"These are the worst ever results published in the last 20 years. It would need a long time to explain why the UK has got such a bad result,\" he said. \"All these results could be better and show that the European commission must work harder, harder for itself and for European construction.\" British support for joining the single currency is even lower at 22%, the poll found, compared with a high of 36% in autumn 1998 and three points lower than the last survey in October 1998. Support for the EU in the UK is down across the board on most issues compared with autumn of last year when the EC last asked the same questions, and only 24% of those surveyed were willing to say that they trusted the commission. For the first time the commission tried to gauge the level of public support for the contentious idea of a European constitution, an idea criticised by the Tory party as a fatal step on the road to a federal European \"superstate\". The British public seem less cautious, however, and 47% of those polled gave their backing to some kind of all-embracing European constitution. Keith Vaz, minister for Europe, who was in Brussels yesterday to discuss EU reform, sought to play down the survey's findings. \"This is just one poll and I can tell you I have met thousands of people who are very supportive of Britain's membership of the EU. We will have a referendum [on the euro] if the conditions are right after the next election,\" he said. Separately, however, commission officials admitted the survey was a particularly bad result and laid the blame for it at the door of the British press. \"It is in large measure a result of a seemingly deliberate attempt by large parts of the British media to distort the facts. We cannot invent a fair press in member states,\" one senior official said - adding that an article in yesterday's Sun which accused the EC of funding the Danish euro yes campaign was a case in point. Other commission officials also admitted that Britain's scepticism about all things from Brussels set it apart from other European countries but said that this was because the British public were much less well informed than their European counterparts. \"The level of knowledge in Britain is the lowest in the EU and people are, relatively speaking, very ignorant. There is a conspiracy of disinformation in swaths of the British media. Look at the number of don't knows,\" one official said. Simon Buckby, campaign director at Britain in Europe, the country's biggest pro-European lobby, put a brave face on the poll and played down its significance. \"This poll has been overtaken by events,\" he argued, \"and the damage done to manufacturing and inward investment by the high pound in recent months has shown that Britain is suffering outside the single currency.\"",

When the controversial criminal justice (mode of trial) bill returns to the Commons tonight the home secretary will be challenged to explain his behaviour - and to apologise to MPs, some of whom believe he deliberately withheld the disputed information. Mr Straw told the Commons second reading debate on March 7 that his plan \"enjoys the active endorsement of the lord chief justice, Lord Bingham, and the vast majority of the high court bench of nearly 100 senior judges\". Yet exactly a fortnight earlier Lord Bingham had expressed his \"concern\" and \"unease\" to the home secretary in a private letter about the \"dangers\" of the legislation which was amended after being thrown out by the Lords. In a last-minute attempt to prevent the bill going through its final stages in the Commons tonight, the leftwing Labour MP and QC Robert Marshall-Andrews last night showed the exchange of letters between Mr Straw and the then lord chief justice to the Guardian - with Lord Bingham's consent to publish them. \"I think there are dangers in excluding consideration of anything which is relevant in the given case,\" Lord Bigham warned Mr Straw, admitting that the amended bill \"causes me concern\".

It was bitterly contested by civil liberty groups and lawyers, whom Mr Straw accused of acting like trade unionists in defence of their fees. When a cross-party coalition of peers, concerned about civil liberty implications, defeated it in January one of their crucial objections was to the so-called \"reputation clause\".

It states: \"Without these spares it has been widely reported that two of the Hawks would be unable to operate. \"There can be few decisions of greater potential impact on the conduct of foreign relations, and on the lives of many people overseas, than decisions as to whether to permit weapons made in this country to be put into the hands of overseas government and their forces ... There is an understandable anger when it is found that British-made weapons have been used to oppress or terrorise people, or to endanger the lives of our service men and women.\" The four committees - foreign affairs, defence, international development, and trade and industry - say that but for a \"well-informed\" leak in the Guardian on January 20, revealing an interdepartmental row over the licences, the matter would not have come to parliament's attention until next summer, when the government reports on this year's arms sales. On February 24 the government announced that seven outstanding licence applications for Hawk spares would be granted. Mr Cook revoked these in May, citing increased violence against white farmers in Zimbabwe. Details given to the committees show that BAe Systems had signed contracts to supply Zimbabwe with Hawk spares for 15 years, but that this contractual obligation could be overridden by a ministerial licencing decision. The committees conclude that the events reveal \"a disturbing degree of muddle and confusion\" arising from the government's conflicting objectives of being a leading arms exporter and a promoter of international human rights. The report proposes that all arms exports licences should in future be scrutinised in detail by the committees before being granted. It insists that this will not threaten commercial confidentiality or delay the issuing of licences. \"Issues of such importance warrant democratic involvement,\" the report says, suggesting that the system should come into force in November, the start of the new parliamentary session. However, the committees cannot make binding recommendations. Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, said the report would \"consign Labour's ethical foreign policy to the growing scrapheap of their broken promises\". The Foreign Office minister Peter Hain - who is thought to have opposed the granting of the licences in private - responded last night by denying that the government had been in breach of its own criteria on arms exports. \"When the situation worsened we acted quickly to impose a full embargo,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "New powers for the court of appeal to increase too lenient sentences passed by judges on child molesters, importers of child pornography and drug traffickers will come into force next month. An order laid before parliament yesterday by the home secretary, Jack Straw, will widen the range of offences in which the attorney general may refer a sentence to the appeal court if he thinks it \"unduly lenient\". At present, the powers cover all offences which can be tried only in the crown court - including murder, manslaughter and rape - plus indecent assault, threats to kill, cruelty to children and serious fraud. The new powers, which will take effect on August 21, will add drug trafficking, illegal importation of pornographic material involving children, unlawful sexual intercourse and gross indecency with a child. The move coincides with recommendations from the law commission today that the crown prosecution service should be given a right to appeal against judges' rulings which cause a case to collapse. Had the right been available, it would have allowed the prosecution to challenge decisions throwing out the case against Colin Stagg, accused of the murder of Rachel Nickell, and refusing a second trial for Kevin Maxwell on fraud charges arising from the collapse of his late father's business empire. Prosecutors would have no right to appeal in cases where a jury acquitted a defendant, even if the judge had made a mistake in summing up. Nor could they appeal against a judge's ruling aborting a trial on the grounds that there was no case to answer. But they would have a right to appeal in cases where the judge ruled it would be an abuse of process for a trial to go ahead, as in the Maxwell case, or where the trial was aborted because the judge ruled key evidence inadmissible, as in the Colin Stagg case. The right to appeal could also have led to a third trial for the men alleged to be the principal conspirators in a cocaine smuggling case. The first trial was aborted after customs and excise gave evidence not previously disclosed to the defence. Five men were found guilty in the second trial but the convictions were overturned because of flaws in the judge's summing up and a retrial ordered. But a judge ruled that the retrial would be an abuse of process. Judge Gerald Butler QC, who carried out an inquiry into the Doran prosecution, recommended in his report last month that a right of appeal for prosecutors in such cases should be considered. The right would apply to the same range of offences covered by the attorney general's power to challenge sentences as unduly lenient. Judge Alan Wilkie QC, the law commissioner responsible for criminal law reform, said: \"Our proposals, if implemented, would allow the court of appeal to correct an erroneous ruling by a judge before the trial or during the prosecution case. It would be the jury, not the judge, who decided on the guilt or innocence of the defendant.\"",

Its action once again wrong-footed his domestic opponents as well as the government of Serbia's tiny sister republic of Montenegro, leaving them uncertain whether to boycott the proposed elections. It also dismayed western governments which have funded opposition media and civic groups and long hoped to see the Belgrade strongman removed from power. In a brief session both houses of the Serbian-dominated house approved election bills which flesh out changes to the constitution agreed a fortnight ago. They provide for the direct election of the federal president for a maximum of two four-year terms. Mr Milosevic has already served two terms as the directly elected president of Serbia, and he became Yugoslav president in 1997 under the old scheme, in which parliament chose the person to fill what used to be a mainly ceremonial job. But he soon took over executive power, leaving his successor as Serbian president the figure-head. Now, in another quick-step, he is giving himself the chance to be chosen by direct election again, thus gaining a mantle of legitimacy. With the opposition divided as usual, not only over who could be a joint candidate, but whether to run at all, he must be the favourite to win. Local and parliamentary elections are due this autumn and Mr Milosevic may hold the presidential poll early, possibly in September. Montenegro's pro-western government has strongly condemned the changes which downgrade the republic's role, but it has stopped short of declaring independence for fear of provoking intervention by the Yugoslav army. It is also hesitating over calling a referendum. The US state department reacted with embarrassment, saying it continued to reject independence for Montenegro, and adding: \"We have urged President Milo Djukanovic to avoid any precipitous unilateral moves.\" The federal parliament in Belgrade also cocked a snook at the United Nations administration in Kosovo yesterday. It reshuffled electoral districts in Serbia so that voters from Kosovo, which is still nominally part of Serbia, can cast their ballots in two districts in Serbia proper. International officials in Kosovo, from which Serb forces withdrew last summer, have just completed registering voters for the polls expected in October. While around a million ethnic Albanians registered, barely a thousand Serbs did. The UN wants Serbs to take part as a sign that the territory still has a multi-ethnic future.

      "bodyText": "Bill Clinton has begun a round-the-clock effort to reinvigorate the Middle East peace talks at Camp David, to hints that the negotiators may be closer to an agreement than seemed likely when the talks nearly broke down last week. Mr Clinton's return from the G8 economic summit in Okinawa on Sunday night has re-energised the US-led negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians at the presidential retreat in the Maryland mountains. Within hours of his return from Japan, Mr Clinton embarked on a gruelling 10-hour overnight session of talks, and resumed again yesterday after less than five hours sleep. As the talks enter their third week, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have now spent more time in the closely guarded Maryland compound than their Israeli and Egyptian predecessors did when they made the first Camp David agreement in 1978. With the Camp David news blackout still in force, there were again few details about the talks. But in a relatively upbeat briefing by the terse standards of the talks, the White House described yesterday's discussions as \"intensive and substantive\" and said Mr Clinton believed that they had the potential to produce the elusive agreement. Israel's chief negotiator, Shlomo Ben-Ami, told Israeli Army radio that \"a final or nearly final clarification will be apparent in the next two days\". The White House merely said that Mr Clinton was \"taking this day by day\", refusing to put a deadline or a timetable on this phase of the talks. The future status of Jerusalem remains the biggest stumbling block to an agreement: Israel and the Palestinians still regard their control of the city as a precondition to a peace deal. An opinion poll published yesterday in Israel showed that 59% of Israelis hope a deal will nevertheless be reached, and only 31% hope the talks will fail. A senior Palestinian official in Gaza took a sombre view, saying that reports of a near agreement were untrue, and that the negotiations were at their most difficult stage. \"There has been no agreement reached on any of the negotiable issues on the table, including Jerusalem, borders, economy, refugees, security, settlements and water. None of the files have been closed,\" Tayeb Abdel Rahim said. Mr Clinton had separate meetings with the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and Palestinian Authority president, Yasser Arafat, on Sunday night. It was his first direct discussions with them since he left for Okinawa on Thursday morning, leaving the secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, in charge. After a dinner attended by the 30 or so principal negotiators on Sunday, Mr Clinton then met a small team of negotiators from both sides until just after 5am. The meetings resumed shortly after 10.30am yesterday and were expected to last for \"several hours\", the White House said. \"Those meetings were intensive and substantive and, as the time indicates, went quite long into the night,\" the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said yesterday. \"The president in his mind is working on what I'll call a rolling assessment of whether the substance and atmosphere at these talks are such that potentially could lead to an agreement.\" Mr Clinton did not have a \"calendar-driven deadline\", he said, adding that the president would remain at Camp David and would keep the parties working for as long as those conditions applied. \"I think the fact that he was up until 5am working through the issues in a very personal, hands-on way, and that he was back at it early this morning, should lead you to believe that he thinks staying here for the time being is worthwhile,\" Mr Lockhart added.",

Patrick Kielty enjoyed weekend parties at Stormont when Mowlam was Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Ms Mowlam obviously gets on well with comedians in general, which made the strained relations between her and Nick Hancock in You Only Live Once (BBC1) all the more obvious. Hancock grilled her in his usual cocky style, cracking jokes about cannabis and masturbation and ensuring that Mowlam didn't hog the spotlight - a novel approach to the feature interview. \"I've come over all Frankie Howerd\", he said, to excuse his eye-rolling double entendres; he then had to restrain his mirth when she said the word \"bankers\". \"Yes,\" said Mowlam, so much unspoken in the pause, \"bankers\". </p> <p>After half an hour of this, one almost began to believe Michael Parkinson's oft-repeated claim that being a chat-show host isn't as easy as it looks. Mo Mowlam is a TV natural: she's funny, she's unabashed, she tells a good story, and she can be serious too. But every time she got warmed up, Hancock was interfering with another of his jokes, as if this was an encounter between equals. And when the host wasn't cutting her short, the editors were. On several occasions, as Mowlam was launching into an interesting point about her life and work, we were vouchsafed only the first sentence. It's hard to believe that she rambled on, or that she started swearing, or said something libellous - she is a politician, after all. Occasionally, however, she was allowed to win a round. Hancock was determined to get mileage out of the Buck ingham Palace question, to which he returned despite Mowlam's obvious disinclination to discuss it. Why, he asked, does it keep returning to haunt her? \"We could let it drop now, so it doesn't come up again\", she said, leaving Hancock frantically scanning his notes for the next question. Mischievous Mowlam deliberately shifted in her chair to block Hancock's view of the autocue. </p> <p>Mo's friend Lily Savage left the wigs at home and set off to the Far East in Paul O'Grady's Orient (ITV), a travelogue with a twist. First stop Shanghai, where O'Grady hoped to plunge headlong into vice but found only cheerful pensioners doing Tai Chi in the park. Following up a lifelong interest in \"Hollywood prozzies\" he went in search of Shanghai Lily, as embodied by Marlene Dietrich in Shanghai Express, but his nearest brush with the trade was a barber who may or may not have offered him a blow-job. This was all by the by, though: the greatest spectacle in Paul O'Grady's Orient was not Shanghai but O'Grady, hungover and in vicious mood, launching into a five-minute diatribe about his high-tech hotel accommodation. \"I don't want to do a degree course in computer studies before I can wipe my arse\", he raved as he prowled round the suite looking for his socks. \"Next time I want a single bed and a plug on a chain.\" Unlike other character comedians, O'Grady's just as funny as his creation - in fact it's hard to know where one ends and the other begins. Savage, whether dressed in sports jacket and slacks or the more usual hooker's wardrobe, is still savage. </p> <p>Timothy Spall turned in a likeable performance as a middle-aged malcontent in The Thing About Vince... (ITV). Home life for Vince and wife Wendy (Marion Bailey) meant \"sitting in front of the telly with a Fray Bentos pie\"; little wonder, then, that he spent the night with \"some little tart\" in a hotel. Nothing happened, he insisted, but Wendy chucked him out anyway. </p> <p>This allowed us to meet Vince's loveable parents (Peter Vaughan and Sheila Hancock) who said things like \"you silly plum\" and \"you great buttock\"; meanwhile Vince's daughter Sally was about to tie the knot with boyfriend Paul, a man who read Bridget Jones's Diary in bed and so couldn't be All Bad. Vince and Wendy resorted to seeing a marriage guidance counsellor, a character so feckless that he brought the entire profession into disrepute. The encounter did, however, allow Spall to reprise his Secrets And Lies turn, getting all articulate and revealing the pain within (\"something's gone wrong somehow\"). Vince and Wendy have two more episodes in which to work things out, and one would be a lot more hopeful of a happy ending if this had been scheduled for a Sunday night. This being a gritty Monday-night show, it could yet end in the divorce courts.</p>",

The fundamentalists and their local supporters erected roadblocks last week to ward off the police after the first eviction orders were issued. In skirmishes 19 people were arrested. Yesterday's operation in the village of Bocnija went smoothly, though bearded fighters filmed police officers descending on two houses. The police found that the first two families due to be evicted had left of their own accord. \"We anticipated obstruction and resistance. You never know with these guys,\" said Mehmed Bradaric, the mayor of Maglaj, himself a Muslim. \"I am extremely pleased that the process has begun without conflict. That is what we wanted. We didn't wish to begin in an uncivilised manner.\" The 89 mojahedin families include about 65 men from Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Sudan, and other countries. The rest are Bosnian militants. They were welcomed during the war of 1992-95, when the United Nations had an embargo on weapons entering Bosnia and the government side was desperate for any kind of military assistance.

      "body": "<p>The exhibition Enclosed and Enchanted, at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, is neither the first nor the biggest contemporary exhibition devoted to art and the garden. As I write, a much larger international show, Le Jardin 2000, is currently on show in and around the Medici Villa in Rome. Enclosed and Enchanted - taking its title from a description of the gardens of Christchurch College in Oxford, in Evelyn Waugh's Brideshead Revisited - brings the garden indoors. Or rather, into the gallery and into our heads. </p> <p>The garden of earthly delights, recreated pre-lapsarian Edens and geometric, symbol-laden metaphysical arbours, are a far cry from the perpetual Sunday afternoon-land of electric strimmers, mutant conifers and whimsical, pastel-painted decking. </p> <p>So far, the Labyrinths and Pleasure Gardens of Belgian artist Jan Vercruysse exist purely as mental retreats, mapped-out and described in a series of reductive coloured plans and text. The text itself is almost enough: \"A pond with black goldfish and some water plants... A very small basin with a fountain at the end of a lane... A conversation garden with two stone benches...\" </p> <p>In Vercruysse's gardens there are mazes, enclosures and plots planted with tall grasses, fields of artichokes, lawns with no flowers at all. The terse, clipped text is as plain - and as deceptive - as the apparent simplicities of the gardens he describes. Within the geometries of hedge, lawn and path are imaginary spaces for conversation and contemplation, places to walk, bounded views. Vercruysse doesn't expect more than a couple of his proposals to be planted in his lifetime, although work is afoot on two of his gardens. </p> <p>Standing and looking and reading his plans, I feel that corners of his gardens are already flourishing in that unkempt weed-choked plot I like to call my brain. The harder one imagines what his gardens would be like, the more peculiar and disturbing they become. Gardens aren't always benign, as the lunatic fantasy gardens which Pirenesi drew and printed in the 18th century testify. Piranesi's prints punctuate the show, to remind us, if nothing else, of the artifice of the garden, its place in our mental geography, its distance from what we like to call the \"natural\". </p> <p>What could be so unnatural as the 16th century garden of Ryoan-Ji, in Japan, the atoll of 15 weathered stones so precisely placed on the raked sea of white gravel, the bounded space within the garden's enclosing wall? Not a fleck of lichen is out of place. The stones disposed on the gravel appear, variously, as a closed fist, a seal, a hump-backed, low-browed mountain. Each stone, with its little encircling patch of greenery, rises from a plain of startling whiteness. Takahiko Iimura's film of the garden, with its tracking shots and long close-ups, which dwell on stone after stone, as though to follow the passage of the spectator's eye, is little more than an atmospheric documentary, with a soundtrack of percussive knocks, tinkling bells, a sonorous Japanese voice. There are brief interludes when the screen goes black and a short, contemplative text appears. Apart from the annoying pixelation of the DVD transposition of Iimura's original film, the work is extremely calming. This is a relief - much of Enclosed and Enchanted acts as a corrective to so much wham-bam, novelty-strewn anxious art of the moment. </p> <p>The exhibition is unapologetically restful, in the way that gardens (apart from those gewgaw-strewn suburban fantasias inhabited by Charlie Dimmock and her straight-man accomplice, the unrelievedly wimpish Alan Titmarsh) are meant to be. It is also a highly accessible show. Where, you ask, is the challenge, the cutting edge, the shock of the new? Study to be quiet, wrote Isaac Walton, quoting the scripture. He may have been writing about angling, but its pleasures, at best, are similar to the pleasures of the garden, and of certain kinds of art which, at our peril, we might lose. </p> <p>It has been a long time since I thought about Wolfgang Laib, the German artist who collects all kinds of unlikely pollen - in this case, the pale, soft Naples Yellow dust of the pine tree - and pours it into soft-edged rectangles on the floor. The oddly glowing, strongly scented pollen sits on a grey floor, attracting the local fauna. On my visit, a millipede was tracking its way around the pollen, till the gallery staff did a pet rescue of the creature. Laib, like the solitary bee, collects pollen. Unlike the bee, his art has no sting. But his entirely pleasurable rectangles of pollen do make your eyes sing, and there's nothing wrong with that. But is it enough? Is this more than Rothko for the New Age? Well, even Rothko can be pretty, and at least Laib doesn't sell us his angst. </p> <p>Canadian artist Stan Douglas's photographs (Douglas is best known as a film-maker) of German gardens and allotments are another matter. I love the kinds of places he records - unkempt, fitfully cultivated zones down by the railway tracks and beside the pylons, with their sheds and greenhouses and compost heaps amongst the ivy, ramshackle fences, plots gone to seed. Between the neat rows of houses, in the hinterlands between industry and farmland, we both husband nature and leave space for the kinds of feral nature which persists in the face of the overdetermined. Douglas's images, shot on mild autumn days, almost smell of rotting apples in the damp grass, wet wood, leaf mould. I'll start sucking on an old briar pipe in a minute. </p> <p>I stop and ask myself why it is that at least three Canadian artists I know of - Douglas himself, Jeff Wall and Peter Doig (a Scot brought up in Canada) - have expressed an interest in these hinterlands between town and country, wilderness and urbanism. Perhaps it has something to do with Canada's scale, the relative modernity of her cities, the absoluteness of the unclaimed tracts beyond. I offer this observation as a question. Yet, as much as we all (presumably) take pleasure in the garden - whether it is manicured, ordered by a surveyor's rule, severely landscaped, artfully arranged as a prettified wilderness - there is something about the ad hoc, organic development of the kinds of places Douglas has photographed which fascinates. Their persistance gives me as much pleasure as seeing foxes in Finsbury Park, sparrowhawks in Hackney. </p> <p>Describing Gilbert &amp; George's 1970 charcoal landscape drawings as \"charming\" is not to denegrate them. Charm is in short supply nowadays. The youthful artists maunder about in the countryside, rest under a mighty oak beside a stream, stand in a sloping field beside a wood, stroll a country lane. Are they taking the piss or what, you ask, these consumately urban figures who'd generally prefer to take their habitual daily constitutionals from Spitalfields to Dalston Junction? The drawings are great. The two artists look lost and fey and sad (as sad as can be, they write on one drawing), out of step and out of place. Which, of course, is their self-adopted role. </p> <p>For all its evident weight, Antony Gormley's Fruit - an iron body-case which resembles a huge apple (look closely and one can see how the final form has the human body as its core) dangling from a heavy cable - is funkier than the general run of his work. It strikes me that there's more humour in Gormley's work than is generally noticed, and if ever his work has a light touch - easy to miss given the nature of his materials - it is evidenced here. There's something a bit macabre about Fruit, too, the idea that this angular, lofty man rolled himself up into a tight ball as though Joyce Grenfell were shouting, \"Small as you can, Antony, that's it!\" while his assistants did their thing with the clingfilm and the plaster. Fruit is an odd and pleasing shape, and leaves a nice puddle of shadow on the floor beneath it. </p> <p>In Cristina Iglesias's Vegetation Room, you are the one who gets enclosed. A small entrance in a big white cube leads you into a cul de sac grotto of writhing, high relief, vine-like vegetation. It is, as I wrote elsewhere about her work, like sticking your head in a hedge. It is a work about enclosure and solitude, and enables the viewer to mentally step outside the gallery. The space is a kind of respite - the same is true of Jean-Marc Bustamante's installation of L-shaped concrete blocks and photographs of evergreen foliage ripe with cones. Both Iglesias and Bustamante want, I think, to perform a kind of quietly theatrical transformation of the physical space of the gallery, to take us elsewhere. </p> <p>It strikes me that this is a rather unfashionable thing to do. Most artists want to take you somewhere horrible and nightmarish. In fact, everything about this show (even Diana Thater's garishly out-of-wack video projection, which turns Monet's garden at Giverny into nastily psychedelic smears of raw colour) asks us to take a break from the anxieties of modern art. Why not, for once, why not? </p> <p>\u0095 Enclosed and Enchanted is at the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, till October 8 (recorded information 01865 813830).</p>",

It has been a long time since I thought about Wolfgang Laib, the German artist who collects all kinds of unlikely pollen - in this case, the pale, soft Naples Yellow dust of the pine tree - and pours it into soft-edged rectangles on the floor. The oddly glowing, strongly scented pollen sits on a grey floor, attracting the local fauna. On my visit, a millipede was tracking its way around the pollen, till the gallery staff did a pet rescue of the creature. Laib, like the solitary bee, collects pollen. Unlike the bee, his art has no sting. But his entirely pleasurable rectangles of pollen do make your eyes sing, and there's nothing wrong with that. But is it enough? Is this more than Rothko for the New Age? Well, even Rothko can be pretty, and at least Laib doesn't sell us his angst. Canadian artist Stan Douglas's photographs (Douglas is best known as a film-maker) of German gardens and allotments are another matter. I love the kinds of places he records - unkempt, fitfully cultivated zones down by the railway tracks and beside the pylons, with their sheds and greenhouses and compost heaps amongst the ivy, ramshackle fences, plots gone to seed. Between the neat rows of houses, in the hinterlands between industry and farmland, we both husband nature and leave space for the kinds of feral nature which persists in the face of the overdetermined. Douglas's images, shot on mild autumn days, almost smell of rotting apples in the damp grass, wet wood, leaf mould. I'll start sucking on an old briar pipe in a minute. I stop and ask myself why it is that at least three Canadian artists I know of - Douglas himself, Jeff Wall and Peter Doig (a Scot brought up in Canada) - have expressed an interest in these hinterlands between town and country, wilderness and urbanism. Perhaps it has something to do with Canada's scale, the relative modernity of her cities, the absoluteness of the unclaimed tracts beyond. I offer this observation as a question. Yet, as much as we all (presumably) take pleasure in the garden - whether it is manicured, ordered by a surveyor's rule, severely landscaped, artfully arranged as a prettified wilderness - there is something about the ad hoc, organic development of the kinds of places Douglas has photographed which fascinates. Their persistance gives me as much pleasure as seeing foxes in Finsbury Park, sparrowhawks in Hackney. Describing Gilbert &amp; George's 1970 charcoal landscape drawings as \"charming\" is not to denegrate them. Charm is in short supply nowadays. The youthful artists maunder about in the countryside, rest under a mighty oak beside a stream, stand in a sloping field beside a wood, stroll a country lane. Are they taking the piss or what, you ask, these consumately urban figures who'd generally prefer to take their habitual daily constitutionals from Spitalfields to Dalston Junction? The drawings are great. The two artists look lost and fey and sad (as sad as can be, they write on one drawing), out of step and out of place. Which, of course, is their self-adopted role. For all its evident weight, Antony Gormley's Fruit - an iron body-case which resembles a huge apple (look closely and one can see how the final form has the human body as its core) dangling from a heavy cable - is funkier than the general run of his work. It strikes me that there's more humour in Gormley's work than is generally noticed, and if ever his work has a light touch - easy to miss given the nature of his materials - it is evidenced here. There's something a bit macabre about Fruit, too, the idea that this angular, lofty man rolled himself up into a tight ball as though Joyce Grenfell were shouting, \"Small as you can, Antony, that's it!\" while his assistants did their thing with the clingfilm and the plaster. Fruit is an odd and pleasing shape, and leaves a nice puddle of shadow on the floor beneath it. In Cristina Iglesias's Vegetation Room, you are the one who gets enclosed. A small entrance in a big white cube leads you into a cul de sac grotto of writhing, high relief, vine-like vegetation. It is, as I wrote elsewhere about her work, like sticking your head in a hedge. It is a work about enclosure and solitude, and enables the viewer to mentally step outside the gallery. The space is a kind of respite - the same is true of Jean-Marc Bustamante's installation of L-shaped concrete blocks and photographs of evergreen foliage ripe with cones. Both Iglesias and Bustamante want, I think, to perform a kind of quietly theatrical transformation of the physical space of the gallery, to take us elsewhere. It strikes me that this is a rather unfashionable thing to do. Most artists want to take you somewhere horrible and nightmarish. In fact, everything about this show (even Diana Thater's garishly out-of-wack video projection, which turns Monet's garden at Giverny into nastily psychedelic smears of raw colour) asks us to take a break from the anxieties of modern art. Why not, for once, why not? \u0095 Enclosed and Enchanted is at the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford, till October 8 (recorded information 01865 813830).",

And if anyone is going to make two-step's first significant album, it is MJ Cole. </p> <p>\"We'll see what happens,\" says Cole (real name Matthew James Firth Coleman), inside London's Soho Studios complex, modestly assessing the chances of his debut LP, Sincere, being greeted as the genre's first major statement of intent. Not that the graduate of London's City University with grade 8 distinctions in piano, oboe and music theory has delusions of celebrity. \"I never dreamed of being on Top of the Pops,\" he says, although he did appear on the programme when his single, Crazy Love, charted earlier this year. </p> <p>\"I'm not into red carpet and glitzy parties and blonde chicks coming up to you.\" Cole may have been recognised by the man behind the deli counter at his local health food shop last week, but it is as a producer, not a performer, that he wants to be acknowledged. \"I want to be like Brian Eno, George Martin or Trevor Horn: a name on a record sleeve. A sign of quality.\" </p> <p>Considering that DJs and mixmasters such as Cole are the new rock gods, with their own ready supply of groupies and drugs, and considering that garage has its roots partly in the ragga shouts of dancehall and \"ruffneck\" blasts of drum'n'bass (its smoother flavas come from American R&amp;B), he has none of the bad boy about him. He learned his trade working the controls \"for \u00a320 a week\" on a slew of drum'n'bass recordings, but a gangsta playa he is not. </p> <p>Cole doesn't have the Mo\u00ebt/ Moschino-hungry appetites of this most aspirational of working-class music scenes, turning up to work the wheels of steel at clubs in T-shirt and jeans before disappearing with his girlfriend on his old Gilera scooter back to his newly acquired one-bedroom flat in London N19. He only moved there from his parents' Twickenham home last February. </p> <p>He may be able to command five-figure sums for a remix (\"half the annual wage of an average person my age,\" he sheepishly reveals when pressed) and be invited to play - either as a DJ or with his band - everywhere from Los Angeles to Singapore, yet \"larging it\", flaunting his fiscal, not to mention physical, pulling power, is not his business. \"I like ladies, certainly,\" he grins, admitting that he is \"having wrangles\" with his significant other about the number of foreign trips on which she should accompany him (she wants to come on them all). \"But I'm not into buying flash cars. I'm more sensible than that.\" For Cole, the \"ultimate thrill\" comes when \"people ring me up and say, 'Great tune.' \" </p> <p>It was Craig David, femme-friendly in the flesh and on record, who won the most rapturous response from the young crowd at this summer's Party in the Park festival, and it is the nattily dressed boy with the mellifluous vocals who sports a near-\u00a31,000 Marco Valentino watch. But you'd be wrong to presume he's only in it for the dough and devotion, the money-man to MJ Cole's muso. As he insists, he is motivated purely by the desire to write and perform. </p> <p>\"More than meeting people and going out with girls, I'm focused on my music,\" he says during a break from filming in the Balearic Islands for MTV's Ibiza 2000. \"Everything around me is surreal. I get picked up in cars and go to celebrity bashes and I get sponsorship on clothes, and it's great and I really enjoy it. But you should remember where it all started: the music. That's the key. As much as money is important for security, for me it is worth nothing without music.\" It is only when pushed for a third time about the possibilities opened up by his new-found wealth that David gets vexed. \"I'm a music man,\" he insists, and you can almost hear him wince. \"It's just music.\" </p> <p>He doesn't yet need the proceeds from his three hit singles anyway - he still shares a home with his British mother (who split with Craig's father, a Grenadian, years ago), where he stays whenever he's not in the capital, or wherever else he's in demand these days. For the singer-songwriter being touted as our first ever decent crossover pop/R&amp;B export, that's most places. </p> <p>He likes going home. \"I lie in bed,\" he confides, recalling Paul Whitehouse's character in The Fast Show who thinks everything is \"brilliant!\", \"and I try and step out of my body for a second and think, 'Craig, what have you actually achieved?' And I say to myself, 'Craig, you're number one!' It's the maddest feeling ever. I don't know if I'm still dreaming. Because it is a dream having a number one.\" </p> <p>David's lyrics on his debut album, Born to Do It, express a similarly quaint worldview, with the accent on courtship rather than copulation. \"I want to make sure what I'm doing is correct,\" says David, virtuous where everyone around him has succumbed to vice, convinced that performing is \"better than sex, definitely\". \"I want to represent myself right, and then hopefully somewhere down the line I'll meet the right person.

Maybe my brain is shrinking, or perhaps I am flooded with protective hormones, but I am tranquillised, withdrawn and think about the birth only as a pleasant, distant event. My blood pressure is positively sluggish and I'm as drowsy as the dormouse in the teapot. I sleep a solid 10 hours at night, then fall into deep naps during the day. How women with full-time jobs or little children manage this bit of pregnancy, I have no idea. For me, though, now that I've accepted that my working day is very limited, it's rather blissful - like being on morphine. </p> <p>I've got to try to focus, though, because I'm supposed to be writing my Birth Plan. It's included in my file of NHS notes and, according to its list of time-prompts, I should actually have filled it in last week. I feel bad - not because I'm afraid of doctors but because I know that the open file and the Birth Plan and all the different choices now available to me in the delivery suite are the result of feminist pressure from outside the medical profession and vigorous reform and scientific progress from inside, and that the least I can do is cooperate. Just like you should always vote, if only in memory of Emmeline Pankhurst. </p> <p>But, like voting, a lot of the exciting politics have gone out of Birth Plans. I no longer have to write \"I want to be active during birth\" because, far from being strapped down or in stirrups, women giving birth in my hospital seem expected to stand, squat and jog round the room, occasionally pursued by midwives with hand-held monitors. Nor do I have to say \"I shall be bringing my own partner, beanbag and birthing pool\" because there's a pool already, the delivery suites are full of beanbags and my partner is not just expected but scheduled into hospital care. </p> <p>The heat has even gone out of the drugs debate. Both I and the hospital want me to have a short, comfortable first stage of labour, then to have as much feeling and control as possible in the second, when I actually push the baby out, so as to avoid forceps, cuts and tearing. We both favour relaxation, gas and air or very light epidurals in order to achieve this. Only unpredictable individual physiology stands in the way of perfection. </p> <p>My Birth Plan, in fact, seems in danger of being very short, something along the lines of: \"I want to be sensible and hope it all doesn't hurt too much. And that there's no one in the birthing pool if I want to get in. Put a towel on the lounger for me.\" </p> <p>More to the point, really, would be a Pre- and Post-Birth Plan, since these are the areas that have suffered most under NHS cuts. My Pre-Birth Plan would include being able to get to know my midwife - the local team is so reduced and under pressure that I've only met her twice. I'd like her to be paid more and to have her workload halved - it took me six weeks to get one appointment. Then she might be able to remember my name. </p> <p>My Post-Birth Plan would involve resting, eating and being shown how to breastfeed in a calm, supportive environment. This is not possible in our maternity ward, not because it doesn't have baby-friendly policies - it does, in spades - but because there isn't the money to pay for more than one midwife per 12 mothers, decent food or even enough cleaners. </p> <p> The restrictions of an old-fashioned maternity ward - babies being taken away at night, timetabled days - have gone but so have the comforts these brought, particularly the prospect of a night's sleep. The ward is so crowded that the best you can expect is four mothers and four babies in one small, hot room, while the unlucky may have a woman with pre-eclampsia or one being induced, adding her particular groans. </p> <p>Of course, I can write on my Birth Plan: \"And afterwards I want to leave ASAP\" but this may not be possible and anyway, individual action is hardly the point. When it comes to birth, I think it's time to abandon beanbags, doctor-berating and single issue politics, and start talking gross national product, the NHS and much better funding.</p>",

Nor do I have to say \"I shall be bringing my own partner, beanbag and birthing pool\" because there's a pool already, the delivery suites are full of beanbags and my partner is not just expected but scheduled into hospital care. The heat has even gone out of the drugs debate. Both I and the hospital want me to have a short, comfortable first stage of labour, then to have as much feeling and control as possible in the second, when I actually push the baby out, so as to avoid forceps, cuts and tearing. We both favour relaxation, gas and air or very light epidurals in order to achieve this. Only unpredictable individual physiology stands in the way of perfection. My Birth Plan, in fact, seems in danger of being very short, something along the lines of: \"I want to be sensible and hope it all doesn't hurt too much. And that there's no one in the birthing pool if I want to get in. Put a towel on the lounger for me.\" More to the point, really, would be a Pre- and Post-Birth Plan, since these are the areas that have suffered most under NHS cuts. My Pre-Birth Plan would include being able to get to know my midwife - the local team is so reduced and under pressure that I've only met her twice. I'd like her to be paid more and to have her workload halved - it took me six weeks to get one appointment. Then she might be able to remember my name. My Post-Birth Plan would involve resting, eating and being shown how to breastfeed in a calm, supportive environment. This is not possible in our maternity ward, not because it doesn't have baby-friendly policies - it does, in spades - but because there isn't the money to pay for more than one midwife per 12 mothers, decent food or even enough cleaners. The restrictions of an old-fashioned maternity ward - babies being taken away at night, timetabled days - have gone but so have the comforts these brought, particularly the prospect of a night's sleep. The ward is so crowded that the best you can expect is four mothers and four babies in one small, hot room, while the unlucky may have a woman with pre-eclampsia or one being induced, adding her particular groans. Of course, I can write on my Birth Plan: \"And afterwards I want to leave ASAP\" but this may not be possible and anyway, individual action is hardly the point. When it comes to birth, I think it's time to abandon beanbags, doctor-berating and single issue politics, and start talking gross national product, the NHS and much better funding.",

In 1998, 302 girls were sent to prison compared with 79 in 1992, yet the number cautioned or found guilty fell from 2,183 girls per 100,000 of the population in 1992 to 1,632 in 1998.</p> <p>The number of girls being imprisoned is rising despite a pledge from home secretary Jack Straw that from April, 15- and 16-year-old female offenders would no longer be sent to prison. The Howard League argued that placing girls in adult prisons, where drugs were widely available and bullying rife, breached the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. But while the prison service has tried to improve provision for girls, with special facilities for them in most of the country's 10 women's prisons, some still end up in the adult system.</p> <p>Clinical psychologist Kathleen Cox of Cox Associates, a firm of expert witnesses who make assessments of young offenders, believes more girls are getting sent to jail and for longer because judges and magistrates consider their behaviour \"unladylike\". \"Have any of these people actually been to prison or seen what happens to girls after they come out?\" Cox asks. \"Some of these girls have physical problems such as poor eyesight or learning difficulties - it would be more useful to sentence them to wearing glasses or learning to read. The punishment should not fit the crime, it should fit the criminal. Let's face it, none of these girls is going to go into jail as a caterpillar and emerge as a butterfly. They don't call prison the university of crime for nothing.\"</p> <p>Baker believes prison can damage teenagers because it normalises crime and punishment. \"In prison you have to make yourself look big and be one step ahead. Sometimes the women look after the younger girls, but the way some of them talk about drugs and crime makes the younger ones think what they've done is OK. Something has gone really wrong with some of the girls in here. Some have babies but they don't talk about them or have photos - they'd rather talk about drugs. I don't want to go back to selling crack when I get out of here, but I would have a much better idea how to do it without getting caught. We compare notes on our crimes every day.\"</p> <p>In prison, Baker has had a chance to reassess her upbringing and sort out her troubled relationship with her mother: \"I grew up in a violent home and never used to get on with my mum, but since I've been in here, we have sorted a lot of things out.\" But not everyone reacts to incarceration in the same way. \"One friend has already asked the gardener if she can have her old job back next time she comes in. Another was taught how to 'wash' cocaine to turn it into crack. She was really excited about getting out so she could practise her new skill.\"</p> <p>Billy Simmonds, 18, who is serving 14 months for actual bodily harm, theft and arson, believes she'll continue to commit crime because that is what she has always done. \"I'd like to get a good job but there's nothing out there. My family say they'll disown me if I reoffend, but I don't think that will stop me.\"</p> <p>Perhaps most worrying of all is the lack of shame attached to being in prison. Mamalyn Gordon, 41, who is serving nine years for importing cocaine, acts as unofficial counsellor to some of the girls. \"They have lost respect for themselves and for others,\" she says. \"A lot lack a mother in their lives and they talk to me about their problems. The younger girls can be bullied by the older women, made to hand over cash sent by their parents or forced into lesbian relationships.\"</p> <p>In the vacuum that Simmonds says is a feature of many of these girls' lives, being like the bad boys is one thing they have to aspire to. \"If a boy can steal a car, there's no reason why we shouldn't. A crime with a lot of status would be something like armed robbery which is traditionally a male crime. That would be really daring.\"</p> <p>Tara Fell, now 20, was 16 when she was sent to Holloway for killing her violent live-in boyfriend. She was freed on appeal but believes she and society would have been better served had she been given probation from the start. \"Prison is definitely not the best place for a young girl. I saw so many 'good' girls who'd committed minor offences like stealing clothes, but by the time they left they felt big because they had served a sentence.\"</p> <p>She believes a more sensible solution would be to tag girls and offer probation groups where they could talk things through. \"A lot of these girls don't realise that if you throw a stone into the water, it makes ripples. They need to be made to see that.\"</p> <p>Chris Tchaikovsky of campaigning group Women In Prison says it is up to policy-makers to change the system. \"If they reduce the problems of the girls committing the crimes, they will reduce the crimes. These girls have had a hell of a life before they come to court. It's like taking a sledgehammer to crack not a nut but a piece of jelly. You can't have girls kicked and abused all through their young lives and not expect them to kick back.\"</p> <p>Angel Baker remains hopeful that the positive bits of her experience of prison will outweigh the negative and stop her returning. \"All I want when I get out is a place I can call my own, a hairdressing and beauty job, and to surround myself with friends. I just want a nice, bright life like everyone else gets the chance to live.\"</p>",

Mamalyn Gordon, 41, who is serving nine years for importing cocaine, acts as unofficial counsellor to some of the girls. \"They have lost respect for themselves and for others,\" she says. \"A lot lack a mother in their lives and they talk to me about their problems. The younger girls can be bullied by the older women, made to hand over cash sent by their parents or forced into lesbian relationships.\" In the vacuum that Simmonds says is a feature of many of these girls' lives, being like the bad boys is one thing they have to aspire to. \"If a boy can steal a car, there's no reason why we shouldn't. A crime with a lot of status would be something like armed robbery which is traditionally a male crime. That would be really daring.\" Tara Fell, now 20, was 16 when she was sent to Holloway for killing her violent live-in boyfriend. She was freed on appeal but believes she and society would have been better served had she been given probation from the start. \"Prison is definitely not the best place for a young girl. I saw so many 'good' girls who'd committed minor offences like stealing clothes, but by the time they left they felt big because they had served a sentence.\" She believes a more sensible solution would be to tag girls and offer probation groups where they could talk things through. \"A lot of these girls don't realise that if you throw a stone into the water, it makes ripples. They need to be made to see that.\" Chris Tchaikovsky of campaigning group Women In Prison says it is up to policy-makers to change the system. \"If they reduce the problems of the girls committing the crimes, they will reduce the crimes. These girls have had a hell of a life before they come to court. It's like taking a sledgehammer to crack not a nut but a piece of jelly. You can't have girls kicked and abused all through their young lives and not expect them to kick back.\" Angel Baker remains hopeful that the positive bits of her experience of prison will outweigh the negative and stop her returning. \"All I want when I get out is a place I can call my own, a hairdressing and beauty job, and to surround myself with friends. I just want a nice, bright life like everyone else gets the chance to live.\"",

It is said that it drives sex offenders underground, making them harder to track and increasing the risk to children; but children are already at risk by unwittingly living alongside sex offenders without even knowing it. Children need to be protected, and their parents have a right to information which will enable them to protect them. This whole problem comes about because we insist on seeing sex offenders as criminals to be punished rather than psychiatric patients to be treated - and the horror of that approach is that we have to release sex offenders back into the community at the end of their prison sentence despite what might be a catalogue of evidence asserting they will quickly reoffend. Mark Leech Chief executive, Unlock, the national association of ex-offenders \u0095 Is the News of the World likely to name and shame the irresponsible drivers who have killed and seriously injured so many thousands of children each year?

In the US criticism has centred not on its fiercely anti-union employment policies (it pays bargain basement wages) but on the way it is alleged to have forced the closure of local shops by luring consumers into gigantic out-of-town centres where its awesome buying power and grinding operational efficiency enable it to undercut all of the local competition.

There will be relief among consumers that the supermarkets and high street retailers will at last face serious competition to bring down the unacceptably high prices they have been charging relative to comparable prices in Europe. There could be macro-economic benefits as well: the government will be relieved that Wal-Mart will single-handedly exert a downward pressure on the retail prices index that could trigger ripple effects throughout the country. But there are also fears that a short-term fall in prices may bring longer term damage as the US giant - the biggest retailer in the world - uses its massive clout and legal nous to build more shopping centres out of town despite the change of policy against building on greenfield sites.</p> <p>Wal-Mart probably won't engender quite the sort of opposition it did in the US among environmentalists - although not, of course, among consumers, who flocked to its stores. This is simply because Britain has already lost so many of its local butchers, bakers and speciality stores to the onward march of the supermarkets. It is those superstores which have most to lose. They will be forced to match the lower prices of Wal-Mart without having the global purchasing power it has to negotiate lower prices from suppliers. Critics claim that once Wal-Mart has seen the competition off it will raise prices, like most monopolies. If there is a danger from that direction, it is some way into the future and beyond the time-horizons of most politicians. What the UK's supermarkets and sellers of consumer goods (not to mention car showrooms) ought to be asking themselves is why they allowed such a market opportunity to happen. If they hadn't kept their prices so high then the UK wouldn't have been quite such an attractive market for Wal-Mart to target.

That argument has been won and must stay won. Wal-Mart may not need to - it has been testing \"neighbourhood stores\" in the US of 50,000 square feet or less which are barely a quarter of the size of its out-of-town stores.

We are aware the world wants less carbon-intensive fuels. What we want to do is create options,\" he explained. But the relaunch was met with cynicism by green cam paigners. Rob Gueterbock, a climate energy speciliast at Greenpeace, said the company's move was a triumph of style over substance. \"They spent more on the logo this year than they did on renewable energy last year. Given they spend $8bn a year on oil exploration, BP stands less for beyond petroleum and more for burning the planet,\" he said. The first of the new retail sites will be opened in London later this year. BP Connect stores will feature in-store e-kiosks where customers can check weather and traffic conditions, pay and call up directions to local destinations. While filling their tanks, motorists will be able to use a touch-screen monitor to order sandwiches, pastries and snacks. The screens will also be used to offer sports scores and latest news. BP also plans to underline its new renewable energy commitment by using solar energy to power the new sites, with panels forming the transparent canopy above the pumps. Sir John added: \"We expect the move to a global brand and introduction of state of the art retailing sites to bring a significant increase in sales.\" He said it was important to strengthen the sense of identity and common purpose of the company's 100,000 employees who work in more than 100 countries around the world. He added that BP was having no problem recruiting staff, despite falling unemployment levels in the United States and Britain.",

In a statement to the Commons which left unanswered many questions about the inadequacy of defence equipment, he told MPs that the government would equip the RAF's Harrier jets with the more accurate US Maverick missile. All-weather satellite-guided weapons would be fitted to Tornados to replace \"dumb\" bombs, whose use was limited in the Kosovo war because of cloud cover. However, the ministry has yet to decide whether the replacement will be a British or US weapon. It is unclear whether the MoD still intends to buy a new British-designed bomb, codenamed Brimstone, which is nearly 10 years late and on which the ministry has spent more than \u00a3600m in development costs. A ministry spokesman said yesterday that Brimstone was designed to attack \"mass armoured targets\". Unexploded \"bomblets\" from cluster weapons dropped from British and US aircraft have subsequently killed a number of people in Kosovo, including two British soldiers, and maimed others. The new bombs, and a more secure air-to-air communication system, will be paid for out of a one-off \u00a3200m the ministry extracted from the Treasury this year. The ministry has already announced that it will spend \u00a380m modifying 200,000 of the army's standard SA80 rifles and machine guns. It was disclosed yesterday that Brigadier Seymour Monro, the most senior infantry officer, had demanded the immediate replacement of the light machine gun version of the SA80 after criticism of its performance in Kosovo; he asked that units serving in Kosovo should be given a new gun as an \"urgent operational requirement\". Ever since the 1991 Gulf war, soldiers have complained of the SA80's tendency to jam and the constant need to reload. The army would like to replace the gun with belt-fed weapons of the kind used by the US army as well as the SAS. Mr Hoon yesterday also confirmed that, despite strong opposition from government scientists, the bulk of ministry's defence evaluation and research agency would be privatised. The ministry has been promised \u00a3250m from the proceeds, with the Treasury taking the rest of the profit from the sale. Some 9,000 scientists will work for a new private company, with about 3,000 retained in a ministry-owned rump that will include the chemical and biological research establishment at Porton Down. The split is designed to appease the US, which is concerned about passing secret research to a private company.

Research conducted by radio watchdogs has found mounting concern about the treatment meted out to unsuspecting callers by over-zealous presenters. Listeners are annoyed by phone-in hosts who appear to encourage controversy simply to boost ratings, and two-thirds told researchers that they switch off or re-tune if they hear something offensive. The report, published yesterday by the broadcasting standards commission and the radio authority, will raise concerns in the industry, which has become increasingly reliant on phone-ins to fill airtime as the number of stations has shot up. Speech-based broadcasters such as Radio 5 Live and Talksport encourage listener participation. The radio authority warned programme-makers to take note of the research: yesterday, Nicky Campbell, one of Britain's foremost phone-in presenters, apologised on his Radio 5 Live show for appearing to suggest, during a discussion last year, that Sky News programmes were inaccurate and biased. Of almost 2,000 people who returned a detailed questionnaire, 40% said they had been offended by something they had heard on the radio. Of these, two-thirds said they had either switched off or tuned to another station. Poor treatment of callers, foul language and racism were the principal concerns. Martin Campbell, director of programming and advertising at the radio authority, said: \"The thread of the research is that people do not want to see radio abused by its presenters.\" The researchers asked a sample group to listen to examples of phone-ins, including two discussions which re sulted in heavy fines from the radio authority last year. The participants were surprised that a discussion about rape on London-based Xfm and another about bestiality on Hallam FM in Sheffield had ever made it to air.

The UK's first Asda Wal-Mart 24-hour supercentre opened in Bristol yesterday with cheerleaders waving pompoms around a 1,000-space car park, \"price-checkers\" on scooters, and an ecstatic squad of \"happy-to-help\" greeters cracking jokes via microphone. One year after US giant Wal-Mart's \u00a36.7bn takeover of Asda, the revamped US-style store at Cribb's Causeway is bigger than a football pitch, with 45 varieties of baked beans, 60 check-outs and some 93,000sq ft of bargain items - some 60% cheaper than rivals. The store - including an optician's, a DIY centre, and clothes and electronics departments - sells 40,000 products from takeaway curry and 42 varieties of toilet roll to own brand Posh and Becks prams. Shoppers entering one of the two \"food\" and \"non-food\" entrances are met within seconds by singing \"welcomers\" who hum tunes and tell gags to add \"personality\" to the dullest of chores. The familiar sight of a half-strangled dog winding its lead round a lamp-post while waiting for its owner has been replaced by Wal-Mart \"pet stops\" - with food, water and shelter for waiting animals. A \"brolley patrol\" shields shoppers from rain and in the \"bobby lobby\", a police constable sits on duty. Nick Agarwol from Asda Wal-Mart said the store anticipates 60,000 shoppers in the first week. The \u00a315m makeover of the Bristol Asda store created 200 jobs and is the first of 10 warehouse-style UK Wal-Marts opening over the next five years, creating 750 jobs. Its aim, the company says, is to create 10% to 15% better value than competitors on food and other items.

But an examination of Mr Mochrie's business affairs would form one line of inquiry. They said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation.</p> <p>After leaving his job at the Welsh Office in Cardiff five years ago Mr Mochrie became involved in property and is believed to have owned licensed premises in the Barry area which closed last year. He is said to have invested in the run-down Barry Hotel successfully turning it round and selling it as a \"going concern\" about three years ago.</p> <p>But a further investment in another hotel, the Pembroke House in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, was set back after a fire last year which forced a halt to business.</p> <p>The Mochries moved to their home at the end of the close 15 years ago and were well liked by neighbours and by teachers at the Roman Catholic school the three eldest children attended.</p> <p>Their youngest child, Bethan, attended a special needs school.</p> <p>Sue White, a school secretary who has known the family for 15 years, said she was horrified by what had happened.</p> <p>She had assumed the family must have gone away on holiday when she did not see Bethan playing outside.</p> <p>\"They were a nice family with four lovely children. The two parents seemed to be very private, but the kids mixed with the other children around here. They seemed to be such a nice, close-knit family. I can't believe we are not going to see them again, especially little Bethan. She was a little poppet. Everybody used to be very protective of her.\"</p> <p>Mike Glinch, headteacher at the Sir Richard Gwyn school where the three older children were pupils, said the Mochries were a strong Roman Catholic family who were supportive of the school.</p> <p>Mrs Mochrie, sister of the former Wales and British Lions rugby scrum half, Terry Holmes, was secretary of the PTA and both parents regularly atended parents' meetings together.</p> <p>Mr Glinch said the the children were pleasant, from a normal, caring family. There had never been a hint of anything sinister behind the scenes. He said the tragedy would affect everybody at the 500 pupil school.</p> <p>According to Mr Glinch, both James and Luke were big, healthy boys - bigger than their father - who were placid and good natured.</p> <p>James left the school with nine GSCEs two years ago to take A levels at a sixth form college in Cardiff and was said by his former headteacher to be a bright boy who had a rosy future.</p> <p>He said Sian would have done well at her GSCEs which she had just finished, while Luke had overcome the problems caused by a brain tumour he suffered from at the age of eight and was doing well at school.</p> <p>He said the last time the younger of the brothers was seen at school was on July 11. As it was coming to the end of term, staff had not thought anything was amiss.</p> <p>Bethan's teacher, Joy Lamacraft, said that although the child had not been at school for two weeks staff had not thought anything of it as she often had days off because of illness. \"She was a little darling. She always had a smile on her face. That is how I will always remember her.\"</p> <p>Mr Holmes was last night said to be distraught at the deaths of his sister and her children.</p> <p>A family spokesman said the former rugby star was shattered as he and his sister had been very close.</p> <p>Curtains remained drawn at the house in Rutland Close last night as forensic experts continued their search of the premises. The examination is expected to take up to two days.</p> <p>Detective superintendent Kevin O'Neill said police had had no indications of a previous history of violence nor were there any indications of any problems in the Mochries' marriage.</p>",

But an examination of Mr Mochrie's business affairs would form one line of inquiry. They said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation. After leaving his job at the Welsh Office in Cardiff five years ago Mr Mochrie became involved in property and is believed to have owned licensed premises in the Barry area which closed last year. He is said to have invested in the run-down Barry Hotel successfully turning it round and selling it as a \"going concern\" about three years ago. But a further investment in another hotel, the Pembroke House in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, was set back after a fire last year which forced a halt to business. The Mochries moved to their home at the end of the close 15 years ago and were well liked by neighbours and by teachers at the Roman Catholic school the three eldest children attended. Their youngest child, Bethan, attended a special needs school. Sue White, a school secretary who has known the family for 15 years, said she was horrified by what had happened. She had assumed the family must have gone away on holiday when she did not see Bethan playing outside. \"They were a nice family with four lovely children. The two parents seemed to be very private, but the kids mixed with the other children around here. They seemed to be such a nice, close-knit family. I can't believe we are not going to see them again, especially little Bethan. She was a little poppet. Everybody used to be very protective of her.\" Mike Glinch, headteacher at the Sir Richard Gwyn school where the three older children were pupils, said the Mochries were a strong Roman Catholic family who were supportive of the school. Mrs Mochrie, sister of the former Wales and British Lions rugby scrum half, Terry Holmes, was secretary of the PTA and both parents regularly atended parents' meetings together. Mr Glinch said the the children were pleasant, from a normal, caring family. There had never been a hint of anything sinister behind the scenes. He said the tragedy would affect everybody at the 500 pupil school. According to Mr Glinch, both James and Luke were big, healthy boys - bigger than their father - who were placid and good natured. James left the school with nine GSCEs two years ago to take A levels at a sixth form college in Cardiff and was said by his former headteacher to be a bright boy who had a rosy future. He said Sian would have done well at her GSCEs which she had just finished, while Luke had overcome the problems caused by a brain tumour he suffered from at the age of eight and was doing well at school. He said the last time the younger of the brothers was seen at school was on July 11. As it was coming to the end of term, staff had not thought anything was amiss. Bethan's teacher, Joy Lamacraft, said that although the child had not been at school for two weeks staff had not thought anything of it as she often had days off because of illness. \"She was a little darling. She always had a smile on her face. That is how I will always remember her.\" Mr Holmes was last night said to be distraught at the deaths of his sister and her children. A family spokesman said the former rugby star was shattered as he and his sister had been very close. Curtains remained drawn at the house in Rutland Close last night as forensic experts continued their search of the premises. The examination is expected to take up to two days. Detective superintendent Kevin O'Neill said police had had no indications of a previous history of violence nor were there any indications of any problems in the Mochries' marriage.",

As well as entitling him to some top table cabinet information about Wales it means he will know be known as the Right Honourable Rhodri.

Richard Lillystone, a solicitor in the agency, which handled the conveyancing for government departments and public agencies, defrauded it of \u00a3542,000 from 1989 to 1998.

The fraud started in 1989 when a public agency for which Lillystone was acting in buying property mistakenly issued a duplicate cheque in favour of the property seller's solicitor. Lillystone opened a building society account in the name of the solicitor but under his own control, and stole \u00a370,000. He later opened other accounts in the names of other solicitors, depositing more than \u00a31.2m and pocketing the interest. The Treasury solicitor's department won a judgment for damages against Lillystone and a court order freezing assets totalling \u00a3250,000. A further investigation found an extra \u00a3137,000 had been paid into his false building society account. Sir John's report said that, although there was no immediate evidence to prove this was part of the fraud, the possibility could not be ruled out.

It argued publicans and shop keepers could face severe financial losses, while local people and well-behaved football fans would be deprived of the right to enjoy a drink. The police already have considerable influence over local landlords, many of whom already close or arrange strict stewarding at pubs near grounds on matchdays. The group is against further measures, because it does not think drink is a cause of football violence. The Home Office said morning kick-offs, which sometimes already take place, were an operational matter for the police. The FA Premier League said it would need to be convinced more were necessary. There had to be \"fairly compelling reasons\" to change kick-off times. These usually were linked to television. \"One of the reasons the majority of football matches are still played at 3pm, on a Saturday, is it is convenient for fans and works in terms of travelling,\" said a spokesman. Kevin Miles, of the Football Supporters Association, said the \"genuine travelling, match-going football supporter always plays second fiddle to the needs of broadcasters or supposed law and order measures.\" He said a blanket alcohol ban in Lens in France when England played there during the 1998 World Cup had not worked since some fans saw it as a challenge \"and people arrived with lorries laden with lager.\" If such bans were applied in Britain they would \"send a message to football fans saying 'we don't trust you to enjoy yourselves',\" he added. The Portman Group also suggested that the goverment should adapt new smart cards, with which school leavers \"buy\" further study, as \"proof of age\" identity cards.",

The crew fight one another to the death.</p> <p>Raymond Leiker and Alvin Latham were the only two on board the Bandit, a Louisiana shrimp boat, a week ago when it was hit by a severe storm in the Gulf of Mexico 30 miles south-east of New Orleans.</p> <p>The night was dark, the sea was high, and the radio was out. When the storm struck, the Bandit began to ship water and sink. Inside the cabin, Captain Leiker grabbed the only lifejacket, fought off Latham's attempt to grab it from him, and prepared to jump.</p> <p>As he did so, a wave hit the Bandit with such force that Leiker was swept overboard and lost the lifejacket, which he had failed to tie up properly.</p> <p>If this were Hollywood, Latham would have plunged in after the skipper and tried to rescue him, as in The Perfect Storm. But as a desperate Leiker tried to clamber back on board, Latham went for him with a knife and a piece of piping, knocking Leiker back into the waves.</p> <p>When Latham was rescued, he told authorities that he and the captain had knelt together on deck and prayed for salvation as the Bandit began sinking. As the boat went down, Latham told them, Leiker's foot got entangled in a net. Latham tried to save him, but to no avail. After the ship sank, Latham kept swimming, and was rescued by another fishing boat.</p> <p>Then Leiker's body was found, floating at sea, full of stab wounds and bruises. \"Until we found the body, there was no indication that anything illegal had gone on out there,\" said John Marie of the local sheriff's office in Plaquemines.</p> <p>Confronted with the evidence, Latham confessed to inflicting the wounds. Yesterday he was due to appear in court in Venice, Louisiana, to answer second-degree murder charges.</p> <p>\"He said he thought the captain was going to come back at him,\" Plaquemines police chief Curtis Bowers said yesterday. \"I think things just went way out of hand, with the weather so bad and the boat sinking, they were just fighting for their lives.\"</p>",

In real life, things go rather differently from the way they do in the movies. The crew fight one another to the death. Raymond Leiker and Alvin Latham were the only two on board the Bandit, a Louisiana shrimp boat, a week ago when it was hit by a severe storm in the Gulf of Mexico 30 miles south-east of New Orleans. The night was dark, the sea was high, and the radio was out. When the storm struck, the Bandit began to ship water and sink. Inside the cabin, Captain Leiker grabbed the only lifejacket, fought off Latham's attempt to grab it from him, and prepared to jump. As he did so, a wave hit the Bandit with such force that Leiker was swept overboard and lost the lifejacket, which he had failed to tie up properly. If this were Hollywood, Latham would have plunged in after the skipper and tried to rescue him, as in The Perfect Storm. But as a desperate Leiker tried to clamber back on board, Latham went for him with a knife and a piece of piping, knocking Leiker back into the waves. When Latham was rescued, he told authorities that he and the captain had knelt together on deck and prayed for salvation as the Bandit began sinking. As the boat went down, Latham told them, Leiker's foot got entangled in a net. Latham tried to save him, but to no avail. After the ship sank, Latham kept swimming, and was rescued by another fishing boat. Then Leiker's body was found, floating at sea, full of stab wounds and bruises. \"Until we found the body, there was no indication that anything illegal had gone on out there,\" said John Marie of the local sheriff's office in Plaquemines. Confronted with the evidence, Latham confessed to inflicting the wounds. Yesterday he was due to appear in court in Venice, Louisiana, to answer second-degree murder charges. \"He said he thought the captain was going to come back at him,\" Plaquemines police chief Curtis Bowers said yesterday. \"I think things just went way out of hand, with the weather so bad and the boat sinking, they were just fighting for their lives.\"",

The jury was discharged yesterday by the trial judge, Mr Justice Hooper. Mr Duckenfield, 55, of Bournemouth, Dorset, who was in charge of crowd control at Sheffield Wednesday's ground, denied the specimen manslaughter charges against two fans, John Anderson, 62, and James Aspinall, 18. They were among 96 Liverpool supporters crushed to death on the terraces during an FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest in April 1989. The charges were brought by the Hillsborough Family Support Group in a private prosecution. The group will meet today and announce its decision about a retrial tomorrow.

Mr Justice Hooper told the jury: \"Notwithstanding your very best efforts I understand you are not going to be able to reach a verdict in this case. In these circumstances I will discharge you from so doing. That will be the end of your involvement in the matter.\" He thanked the jurors for the great care and attention they had given to considering the case. \"Sadly you have not been able to reach a verdict - but these things happen,\" he said. The families had said in the private prosecution that the two police officers were responsible for the fans' deaths. They were said to have ordered the opening of an exit gate to relieve the crush of supporters outside the turnstiles without taking steps to block off a tunnel leading to the already overcrowded Leppings Lane terraces. The judge had told the jurors that they had to consider whether there were failings on the part of the officers that led to the disaster, and whether any failings amounted to a serious criminal offence. Alun Jones QC, prosecuting, said the two men should have blocked off a tunnel leading to central pens of the terrace, diverting fans to uncrowded pens on either side. \"The entry of dozens of spectators into a tunnel, with a slope down to the terraces, over a period of eight minutes, forced hundreds of people down the terrace [to] the pens into a hideous crush,\" he said.

The institution said that in the three months to the end of June house price rises were at their lowest since 1998. The percentage of surveyors reporting a rise in house prices over those who saw a fall was only 5%. This figure represented a drop of 25% on the previous month. The report said that this finding showed a continued slowing of house price inflation and that it signalled the end of the boom in UK prices which had lasted since early last year. However, the institution added that with good economic and employment prospects, further price rises were likely, though at a much more moderate pace than had occurred in previous months. A spokesman for the institution said: \"With a plentiful supply of properties on most chartered surveyor estate agents' books, and the real prospect of house price reductions, the next few months should be a good time to consider buying. \"Stability in the market and realistic pricing should also help the first time buyers who have been put off by recent market conditions.\" The slowdown in price inflation at national level has, however, disguised wide regional variations. In London, prices fell for the first time since 1998, with 14% of chartered surveyors reporting falls. But in the north of England the trend is still upwards, with 39% of surveyors reporting rises - up from 23% in May. Estate agents in Yorkshire, Humberside, and the West Midlands also reported rises, although the East Midlands, East Anglia, the south-east, south-west, and north-west reported a downturn in the rate of price inflation. The number of transactions in the period covered dropped, with the average number of house sales for each surveyor at 30 - down 12% from the previous survey and representing the lowest level since December last year. \u0095 Press Association",

Despite popular paranoia about predatory paedophiles kidnapping children off the street, only a handful of children - between five and 10 - are kidnapped and murdered every year by strangers.</p> <p>Another popular fear - that all sex offenders will reoffend again and again - is also not borne out by the facts. One study that followed up some 4,000 offenders against children over a period of 21 years found that 16% were reconvicted of a child sex offence. A range of international studies have put re-offending rates for sexual offenders at between 15% and 43%. This is some way short of the 64% reoffending rate for child sex offenders presented by the News of the World to justify their ill- conceived \"campaign\".</p> <p>Though the majority of abused children do not go on to become abusers, most child sexual abusers were themselves abused as children (70% according to a recent Home Office study of participants in sex-offender treatment programmes). This means that reducing the risk of sex offenders abusing children should help to reduce the prevalence of sex offending in the future.</p> <p>The sex-offender register is probably the best-known recent initiative for managing sex offenders in the community. It came into force on September 1, 1997 and requires sex offenders who, after that date, were convicted or cautioned, were serving a custodial or community sentence, or were being supervised to notify the police of their names and addresses and of any subsequent changes. This requirement lasts for periods of time that vary according to the seriousness of the offence but it is a lifetime requirement for anyone imprisoned for 30 months or more.</p> <p>The sex-offenders register is a useful, though limited, power. It can help the police apprehend a suspect if an offence takes place, but it does little to reduce the risk of offending. Though there have been some concerns about how few sex offenders are coming forward to register, this problem will be made immeasurably worse if paedophiles fear reprisals. Perhaps the single greatest loophole in the current legislation is that those who kill a child with a sexual motivation are not covered by the register, as their crime is deemed to be violent, rather than sexual. This means that, when caught, Sarah Payne's killer may not be required to register, if he or she were to be released from prison.</p> <p>The 1998 Crime and Disorder Act enables courts to order the post-release supervision of such offenders for periods of up to 10 years. This should improve public protection and the prospects for rehabilitating offenders. Post-release supervision can include conditions requiring, for example, offenders to live in supervised accommodation, to stay away from specified places or people, or to take part in treatment programmes. Failure to cooperate can result in recall to prison.</p> <p>A recent survey by the probation inspectorate found that 93% of sex offenders, and 96% of those in probation hostels, did not reoffend while under probation service supervision. If there is a problem, it is that courts are not using their powers for extended supervision as regularly as they could.</p> <p>If community supervision is to be fully effective, more treatment programmes for sex offenders are needed. Treatment programmes aim to counter sex offenders' distorted beliefs; increase their awareness of the impact of their crimes on victims; make offenders accept responsibility for the results of their actions; and help them to control their deviant behaviour and avoid relapse. Recent Home Office research on sex offenders on probation orders found that 5% of those participating in treatment programmes were reconvicted within two years, around half the figure for offenders under probation supervision without a treatment programme (9%). Both the prison service and the probation service have greatly increased the number of programmes in recent years, but more than half the sex offenders supervised by the probation service and two-thirds of those discharged from prison have not been through a sex-offender treatment programme.</p> <p>A second key requirement for effective supervision is stable accommodation for released sex offenders. If offenders constantly move from place to place, their supervision and treatment is disrupted. The issue was highlighted in March 1998 by the court of appeal in R v the chief constable of north Wales police. The appellants, two paedophiles, had gone to ground after being made homeless by a police decision to reveal details of their offences to a caravan site owner. While upholding the lawfulness of the police's actions, Lord Woolf's judgment stressed the importance of efforts to find appropriate accommodation for offenders when they are released from prison.</p> <p>A missing piece in the current legislative jigsaw is an indeterminate sentence for dangerous offenders, which would mean that sex offenders could be held in custody for as long as they pose a risk, rather than being released when their sentence ends, regardless of the danger they pose. This is being considered by the government in the case of those with a dangerous personality disorder.</p> <p>The laws for dealing with child sex offenders are not perfect, but creating a vigilante culture is no way to solve the problem of child abuse.</p> <p>Richard Garside is head of communications for Nacro, the crime-reduction charity</p>",

Recent Home Office research on sex offenders on probation orders found that 5% of those participating in treatment programmes were reconvicted within two years, around half the figure for offenders under probation supervision without a treatment programme (9%). Both the prison service and the probation service have greatly increased the number of programmes in recent years, but more than half the sex offenders supervised by the probation service and two-thirds of those discharged from prison have not been through a sex-offender treatment programme. A second key requirement for effective supervision is stable accommodation for released sex offenders. If offenders constantly move from place to place, their supervision and treatment is disrupted. The issue was highlighted in March 1998 by the court of appeal in R v the chief constable of north Wales police. The appellants, two paedophiles, had gone to ground after being made homeless by a police decision to reveal details of their offences to a caravan site owner. While upholding the lawfulness of the police's actions, Lord Woolf's judgment stressed the importance of efforts to find appropriate accommodation for offenders when they are released from prison. A missing piece in the current legislative jigsaw is an indeterminate sentence for dangerous offenders, which would mean that sex offenders could be held in custody for as long as they pose a risk, rather than being released when their sentence ends, regardless of the danger they pose. This is being considered by the government in the case of those with a dangerous personality disorder. The laws for dealing with child sex offenders are not perfect, but creating a vigilante culture is no way to solve the problem of child abuse.

      "body": "<p>Michel Droit, who has died aged 77, was a French journalist and television presenter, whose championing of General de Gaulle led to him being criticised by colleagues as \"a caricature of complacency\". Both highly praised and deeply despised during a long and distinguised career, he was always courageous and determined.</p> <p>Born in Vincennes, Droit was a student at the \u00c9cole Libre des Sciences Politiques in Paris, which he left to join the wartime resistance and to establish an independent radio service to broadcast news of German defeats. He followed the Free French first army and described the liberation of Paris.</p> <p>After the war, he reported from all round the world for French radio. In 1949, he joined a young team preparing to produce television news, and began making short films and writing novels. In 1956, he started presenting the evening television news, and thus became a well-known national figure.</p> <p>Apart from those who were simply jealous, there was a real split in the world of journalists and critics towards Droit's work. The French Ministry of the Interior kept a tight hold on television news; neither presenters nor producers enjoyed freedom. But it was noticed that the man who had written Le Monde's television criticism (a column he had to give up in 1956) accepted these controls only too readily.</p> <p>Droit made no attempt to conceal his enthusiasm for Gaullism and de Gaulle, who returned to power in 1958, and he saw nothing abnormal in refusing to give time to those opposed to the Algerian war.</p> <p>In the presidential election of December 1965, there was no winner in the first ballot, and de Gaulle faced the humiliation of having to fight Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in the second round. Totally discouraged, he considered resignation. His advisers recommended that he show himself to the French people as he was. Michel Droit was considered the television interviewer who would display the general to best advantage, and indeed the three resulting programmes softened the leader's Olympian image, presenting him instead as a smiling, thigh-slapping politician.</p> <p>When de Gaulle won the second ballot with 54.5% of the votes, it was said that without the Droit interviews, he would not have succeeded. Droit was praised, although there were protests about television manipulating politics. In 1968 and 1969 he made two more programmes with de Gaulle, in the second of which the general announced that he would resign if defeated in the constitutional referendum (he was, and he did).</p> <p>In 1960, Droit became edi tor of Figaro-Litt\u00e9raire, a post he occupied for 11 years. But it was increasingly being said, particularly after 1965, that television was the enemy of culture - so Droit found himself constantly criticised. His novels were attacked and his literary ability mocked. When he broke his foot while skiing, Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac expressed the hope that this would not affect his writing.</p> <p>But Droit was not to be put off. He produced five volumes on de Gaulle and a film, Un Fran\u00e7ais Libre (1972). A book which attracted a great deal of attention was La coupe est pleine (The Cup Is Full, 1975), a warning about immigration. As a member of GRECE (Groupement de recherches et d'\u00e9tudes pour la civilisation europ\u00e9enne), Droit was of the new right, as well as the Gaullist right; in 1981, with the election of Mitterrand, he resigned from all positions in radio and television.</p> <p>Elected to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in 1980, Droit continued to collaborate with Figaro, and to write books that attracted varying degrees of enthusiasm or condemnation.

      "bodyText": "Michel Droit, who has died aged 77, was a French journalist and television presenter, whose championing of General de Gaulle led to him being criticised by colleagues as \"a caricature of complacency\". Both highly praised and deeply despised during a long and distinguised career, he was always courageous and determined. Born in Vincennes, Droit was a student at the \u00c9cole Libre des Sciences Politiques in Paris, which he left to join the wartime resistance and to establish an independent radio service to broadcast news of German defeats. He followed the Free French first army and described the liberation of Paris. After the war, he reported from all round the world for French radio. In 1949, he joined a young team preparing to produce television news, and began making short films and writing novels. In 1956, he started presenting the evening television news, and thus became a well-known national figure. Apart from those who were simply jealous, there was a real split in the world of journalists and critics towards Droit's work. The French Ministry of the Interior kept a tight hold on television news; neither presenters nor producers enjoyed freedom. But it was noticed that the man who had written Le Monde's television criticism (a column he had to give up in 1956) accepted these controls only too readily. Droit made no attempt to conceal his enthusiasm for Gaullism and de Gaulle, who returned to power in 1958, and he saw nothing abnormal in refusing to give time to those opposed to the Algerian war. In the presidential election of December 1965, there was no winner in the first ballot, and de Gaulle faced the humiliation of having to fight Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand in the second round. Totally discouraged, he considered resignation. His advisers recommended that he show himself to the French people as he was. Michel Droit was considered the television interviewer who would display the general to best advantage, and indeed the three resulting programmes softened the leader's Olympian image, presenting him instead as a smiling, thigh-slapping politician. When de Gaulle won the second ballot with 54.5% of the votes, it was said that without the Droit interviews, he would not have succeeded. Droit was praised, although there were protests about television manipulating politics. In 1968 and 1969 he made two more programmes with de Gaulle, in the second of which the general announced that he would resign if defeated in the constitutional referendum (he was, and he did). In 1960, Droit became edi tor of Figaro-Litt\u00e9raire, a post he occupied for 11 years. But it was increasingly being said, particularly after 1965, that television was the enemy of culture - so Droit found himself constantly criticised. His novels were attacked and his literary ability mocked. When he broke his foot while skiing, Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac expressed the hope that this would not affect his writing. But Droit was not to be put off. He produced five volumes on de Gaulle and a film, Un Fran\u00e7ais Libre (1972). A book which attracted a great deal of attention was La coupe est pleine (The Cup Is Full, 1975), a warning about immigration. As a member of GRECE (Groupement de recherches et d'\u00e9tudes pour la civilisation europ\u00e9enne), Droit was of the new right, as well as the Gaullist right; in 1981, with the election of Mitterrand, he resigned from all positions in radio and television. Elected to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise in 1980, Droit continued to collaborate with Figaro, and to write books that attracted varying degrees of enthusiasm or condemnation. Thus, an essay praising apartheid (1983) caused indignation, and an \"Open letter to those who have had enough of socialism\" (1985) proved popular in some quarters. Droit was caught up in an affair of alleged corruption from 1987, and was accused of defending the interests of a private radio company. After three years of political-judicial argument, he was cleared. His pastime was hunting, and on safari in central Africa he killed his guide in a shooting accident. He and his wife Janine had a son and daughter. Douglas Johnson Michel Droit, writer, broadcaster and television producer, born January 23 1923; died June 22 2000",

AP, Bangkok Two journalists taken by rebels Two local journalists covering the hostage crisis on Jolo island in the southern Philippines for a local television network were seized yesterday by Islamic rebels. The journalists, who work for the ABS-CBN network, were travelling to an Abu Sayyaf rebel hideout to interview seven European hostages when three armed men stopped their vehicle and led them off into the jungle, according to their driver. AP, Jolo Chinese bears saved by pact The Chinese authorities signed an unprecedented agreement with an animal welfare group in Hong Kong yesterday to release 500 endangered Asiatic black bears which are being used to yield ingredients for Chinese medicine. The agreement between the China Wildlife Conservation Association, Sichuan forestry department and the Animals Asia Foundation means the bears can be released from the farms in Sichuan where many lie sick and injured in metal cages with dirty catheters, used to extract gallbladder bile, protruding from their stomachs. AP, Hong Kong Mass grave may hold 200 bodies An excavation team has found a suspected mass grave that may hold more than 200 North Vietnamese soldiers killed and bulldozed into a pit by US forces during the Vietnam war.

Last night the fire in the Mesa Verde national park in south-west Colorado covered 17,000 acres (6,900 hectares) and was within miles of the park's priceless and spectacular native American cliff dwellings, which mainly date from the 13th century. \"The fire is doing what it wants, and everything is imperilled,\" a spokesman for the fire-fighting operation, Justin Dombrowski, said. \"It's a big powerful fire. Right now it's moving so fast and so far that it puts everything in that park at a greater threat.\" With temperatures in the western United States continuing at record levels, the hot dry weather offers little immediate hope that the blaze will be brought under control. Firefighters again bombarded it from the air with retardant chemicals and thousands of gallons of water yesterday, but the rough terrain and deep valleys of the Mesa Verde hamper all efforts from land and air. None of the main historical sites in the Mesa Verde - the only wholly archaeological national park in the United States - has yet been struck by the fire, but the flames are less than three miles from the unique and evocative ruins known as Cliff Palace, a 13th century village consisting of more than 200 rooms wedged in the overhang of a sandstone rock face. More than a thousand tourists were evacuated from the park when the fire started last Thursday, probably from a lightning strike. \"As long as the fire continues to create its own weather inside and around it, it's going to grow,\" said Chuck Maxwell, the fire team weather adviser. A second fire 25 miles to the north of the Mesa Verde has further stretched the emergency services. \"We're running short on resources,\" a fire service coordinator in nearby Durango said. Archaeologists remain hopeful that the cliff dwellings and other buried sites will survive whatever the fire has in store, but the sandstone from which the buildings are made is vulnerable to extreme heat, which can cause it to explode. The impending disaster has a silver lining for archaeology, however, since the fire has revealed at least a dozen previously unknown sites on the flat-top mountains of the area, which are normally covered in the green juniper, pinyon and oak brush. A fire in 1996 led to the discovery of more than a hundred new sites. \"It's a bit of a trade-off,\" said Jane Anderson, a National Park Service archaeologist. \"It's exciting to see the new ruins and get that information, but at the same time, fire can destroy these sites.\" The beautiful ruins, which nestle high in the cliff alcoves of the remote mountains near the New Mexico border, were mostly built between 1190 and 1270, and are believed to have housed several thousand Pueblo Indians before they were mysteriously evacuated around 1300. Since the ruins were discovered a century ago, they have become a major tourist attraction, a cradle of New Age cultural activity. and a source of intensive academic dispute.

All four male members of the gang were convicted earlier this month. Their theft at gunpoint of cars, jewellery and other valuables raised more than 150,000 rand (\u00a315,000). Miss Oosthuizen, the daughter of a millionaire businessman from Warmbaths, north of Johannesburg, appeared in court in leg irons on six charges of armed robbery. The court ordered her to be detained at Pretoria's maximum security prison while psychiatric tests are made. The prosecution told the court that one gang member William Prinsloo, 18, with whom Ms Oosthuizen had sex, made just 1,000 rand from the crimes, half of which he spent on a tattoo.

Leicester's 55 students 'in residence' came from Birmingham and London, whilst LSE's 200 travelled in each day from two nearby London boroughs, Waltham Forest and Hammersmith and Fulham.

But it is intended to keep a bright spark glowing through sometimes difficult years. </p> <p>\"Robert's been asking questions ever since he learned to speak,\" said his mother, Diane Bourne, a Hull school dinner lady, who was proudly at the city's Guildhall for the ceremony, which turned out all the local great and good, including the playwright John Godber. \"He seems to be interested in everything - it can get quite exhausting at home.\" </p> <p>Targeting Robert, and the top 10% of new arrivals in the first year at each of Hull's 16 secondary schools, was the project's initial strategy, which required the children to enrol in and carry out a six-month course of weekend extra lessons, pairing with student mentors and visiting the universities, to earn their scrolls - each a written offer of a degree course - from Lord Dearing. Using Sats, teacher reports and interviews with the children, the programme set out to locate and raise the sights of families where university had simply not been considered an option. </p> <p>\"There are plenty of children in Hull who haven't any idea that they even can get to university,\" said Hilary Jones, schools liaison officer at Hull University, which has fielded professors alongside the student mentors for the mini-students' taster course. \"The scheme says to them: you've been identified as an achiever; now we're going to help you carry on that way, to become an effective learner who can and will go on to get the necessary grades.\" It also creates a bright cohort, with its own peer group pressure to treat learning as \"cool\". </p> <p>Robert positively bounces with the accolade, like most children given an encouraging pat; and his counterparts appear to spreading the message to classrooms that the more formal ways of UCAS seldom reach. The key feature of the Hull scheme is that 10% are taken from each and every high school in the city, giving those at the bottom of the exam league table an equal chance. </p> <p>Since Hull had the worst league table results in the country last year, for the second year running, this is crucial stuff. The city council, which is also investing \u00a335m in school repairs from its telecom bonanza (the hugely successful float of the municipally-owned local phone company with its famous white kiosks) backs the scheme with vim. Hand-picked \"inspirational teachers\" have been seconded to the students' three-hour Saturday sessions at the two universities. </p> <p>Dr Andy Swallow, assistant director of education for Hull, says: \"Just over 96% of pupils picked for the pilot scheme have stayed the course, many more than originally expected. We had good reason for optimism, though, after research at local schools and the Hull Children's University\" (a council innovation which tempts children as young as seven with even smaller academic gowns than Robert's, plus courses such as \"Literacy and ice skating\"). </p> <p>\"It's been really good,\" said Robert, whose only regret was that his dad, also Robert, had to watch the ceremony on a camcorder video because it clashed with his late shift at a Hull chemical plant. That work has been a bonus too , however. Robert says: \"My dad got me interested in science through telling me about his job.

He picked it up and his deputy head told him that his school was on fire. He threw on some clothes and drove to Brigshaw High, a 1,150-pupil 11-18 comprehensive on the semi-rural eastern edge of Leeds. </p> <p>\"I arrived to find the school in flames,\" he recalls. \"For the next few hours we watched the destruction of the whole building.\" </p> <p>Almost two thirds of the school was burnt out in the fire, which took place on April 1 this year. The damage is estimated at \u00a38m. The English department, the art department, the science labs, the technology workshops were all destroyed. Teachers' lesson plans and records, some of them built up over entire teaching careers, went up in smoke. So did most of the GCSE coursework. Two youths have been charged with arson. Brigshaw High will not be fully rebuilt until 2002. </p> <p>Going by the law of averages, Brigshaw High was not the only school to go up in flames that night. Every day, in England, three schools are set on fire. Only 15% of these fires are believed to be accidental: the other 85% are malicious. Insurance figures show that schools are at a higher risk of arson than any other buildings used by people. Only sheds and barns fare worse. </p> <p>Arson in schools has cost \u00a345m so far this year. That figure is predicted to reach \u00a385m by Christmas, which would make this year the worst since records began. Much of that sum is taken up by a few big fires, like Brigshaw's, but there are hundreds more small ones that do not get out of hand- a survey in 1995 showed the fire brigade was only called to 45% of school fires. </p> <p>So what are the causes of this epidemic of school arson, and can anything be done to prevent it? </p> <p>Going by the people who are caught, we think we know who sets schools on fire. It is children, and most of them are boys. Some are mini-arsonists, as young as eight or nine, and below the age of criminal responsibility. Some are not much older: 65% of all offenders cautioned for arson are aged 10 to 14. At any age they are likely to have a connection with the school: to be pupils, former pupils, friends of pupils. </p> <p>We also know when they set schools on fire - and the season is well under way. According to the Arson Prevention Bureau, malicious school fires peak in May and in July, during school holidays and at weekends. By far the worst time is between 6 and 10pm, although there is small surge between 1 and 3pm too. </p> <p>There is a clear pattern, says the bureau's school arson expert, Larry Stokes: \"Most schools which experience fires, first find they have more graffiti, smashed windows, a small fire in a bin, perhaps a fire in a portable unit, and then a big fire. It's what we call a slide to ashes.\" </p> <p>But why do children set schools on fire? At this point we need a caveat. The clear-up rate for arson is terrible: only 10% of arsonists are ever caught. The clear-up rate for school arsonists is even worse. Only 2% of school fires result in a caution or conviction. So any information we have about who sets schools on fire, and what their motives are, is heavily undermined by the fact that we know nothing whatsoever about the nature and motives involved in 98% of them. </p> <p>Nevertheless, from the few who are caught we can draw some tentative conclusions. Many small children play with matches. Many slightly older ones experiment with fire. Some of them bring their experiments to school without any intention of burning the place down, says Andrew Muckley, a psychologist who used to work with fire-setting children at Aycliffe young offenders' institution. </p> <p>\"People who set fire to schools usually have an interest in fire; they have poor communication skills, they get angry and they act out their feelings. There's always one teacher they get really angry about - most of us get really cross with one teacher, but we can handle it. These people can't. </p> <p>\"The teacher punishes them; now they are going to punish the teacher. They probably come from a family that is all mixed up and doesn't set limits and says things like 'boys will be boys'. They don't plan to burn the school down; it's quite likely that they haven't thought about the consequences at all. </p> <p>\"They go in, probably set fire to the classroom of the teacher they are angry with, and run away.\" </p> <p>Leaving the school and the local education authority to pick up the pieces. </p> <p>Although most schools are covered for fires by local authority insurance, there are a few which opt out \"as they legally may\" and so may be underinsured. As individual schools gain in power and local authorities decline, some authorities are giving way to pressure from schools in low-risk areas to pay lower premiums than their inner-city, high-risk neighbours. </p> <p>Nevertheless the general experience of schools after a fire is that the local authority steps in fast. After this year's fire at Brigshaw High no child missed more than eight days' schooling, and GCSE classes missed only three. Everyone was reinstalled in a mobile school made up of 40 portakabins - making Brigshaw the ironic beneficiary of yet another school fire. The mobile school came across the Pennines from Manchester, where Abraham Moss High School, spectacularly burned down in May 1997, had just finished rebuilding and no longer needed it. </p> <p>Yet the after-effects of the Abraham Moss fire still go on, according to the head, David Watchorn. His 900-pupil school was reduced to a shell. No one was ever caught: \"When people talk to me about the fire, something dark and nasty comes up inside me and makes me feel difficult. I think the school is still suffering from it, because so much effort is devoted first of all to surviving, and then to rebuilding. At the end of it, you think what have I done for the last three years?\" </p> <p>So given all this pain, could schools do more to prevent fires? The experts are surprisingly unanimous on this. Schools could do a great deal more, and no one can quite believe that they don't. Take the buildings, says Larry Stokes. School design in the past 30 years has undoubtedly favoured the arsonist over the firefighter. </p> <p>\"Schools are generally light in construction with lots of communication and voids at roof and ceiling level, which means a fire that breaks out in a single classroom can spread from there to the whole school.\" </p> <p>Architects and school premises committees need to address fire prevention, he says. </p> <p>\"The difference between a \u00a31m fire and a \u00a310m fire may be an inadequate partition between two rooms.\" </p> <p>Then there are the children. If a child is playing with matches in a primary school, staff will generally notice says Andrew Muckley. In secondary schools, they often don't. </p> <p>\"There are so many teachers and it is so impersonal. Ten different teachers might notice that a pupil is carrying matches, that there is a burnt smell about them, that there is charred newspaper in the wastebin. When the school burns down, they all get together and say \"Oh yes, I noticed that. </p> <p>\"Schools don't see fire-setting as part of their agenda until the school has gone. They don't talk about it. They see pupil behaviour as the problem: so they exclude the pupil and now he is really angry and he has time to think about the fire he is going to set. If a child comes into school with a bruise on their arm, there's a panic. If a child comes in with a box of matches, the head confiscates them and says 'Don't do that again.' But the most dangerous situation is the one with the box of matches.\" </p> <p>Of course schools cannot necessarily then stop the child setting a fire. But there are plenty of people who say they can. Many local fire services now have education programmes, directed particularly at young children who play with matches. They will visit the child and family in their home, talk to them about how scarily fire spreads, encourage them to fit smoke alarms and take responsibility for fire and its consequences, instead of seeing it as an exciting game. Schools can recommend families for these programmes. </p> <p>For children who have already been caught setting fires, local youth offending teams, sometimes in conjunction with the fire service, run extended versions of the same programme: taking children to the fire station, showing them what happened after they had set a fire and fled the scene, showing them videos of conflagration, encouraging them to see fire as something to treat with respect. </p> <p>A novel preventative version of this has just been launched in Nottingham, where the city council, Zurich Municipal insurance company, the Arson Prevention Bureau, police and fire services are sending a theatre workshop and curriculum materials into schools, to encourage teenagers to think about the consequences of fire and to carry out fire risk assessments of their own schools. </p> <p>There is a risk that such a programme might give a determined fire-setter ideas, admits Larry Stokes; no one has tried prevention on this scale before so no one knows. But sooner or later they would probably have set a fire anyway, and - with the proviso again that most arsonists are not caught - such schemes suggest that reoffending rates among their \"graduates\" are very low. </p> <p>Andrew Muckley, who ran one among serious arson offenders at Aycliffe, says this is partly because fire-setting is a relatively unrewarding crime. It does not bring the material rewards or excitement of burglary or car theft. Only one of the children who went through his fire-setters' programme was ever sent back to Aycliffe while he was there. </p> <p>\"He was 14; he came back two years later and I thought: 'Oh no, where did we go wrong?' I went to see him and he said 'I'm back here because I've taken about another 80 cars and done another 100 burglaries. But I didn't set any more fires.' \" </p> <p><strong>Five ways to fight fire</strong></p> <p> <strong> 1</strong> Assess the building; check partitions and roof voids. Ensure that skips, rubbish or recycling bins, sheds and other storage are in secure areas, at least eight metres from the main building. </p> <p><strong>2</strong> Deter entry with perimeter fencing, security lighting, staff living on site, CCTV. </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Ensure that one person has key responsibility for thinking about fire, not only about buildings, but also reminding colleagues to mention concerns about children. </p> <p><strong>4</strong> Investigate fitting sprinkler or fire detection systems. </p> <p><strong>5</strong> Build links with the local fire service; find out if they have a fire education programme.</p>",
