This can mean substantial bills for large publishers - the AA printed more than 300m copies of the maps and atlases in dispute. Companies which do not make money from publishing maps, but which want to use Ordnance Survey maps on advertising material, are charged a fee of \u00a345 a year. Established in the 18th century, Ordnance Survey was originally intended to provide the army with reliable maps to help put down rebellion and invasion. The organisation is still wholly owned by the government but it was recently granted \u201ctrading fund\u201d status, which allows it to keep any profits for reinvestment in the business. It made profits of \u00a312.7m last year, on sales of \u00a399.6m. Ms Lawrence said: \u201cWe are the master mapper of Britain. I would always wish to settle disputes like this in a businesslike way - we have to protect the intellectual property of both ourselves and our licensed partners.\u201d",

Full-time officials and shop stewards will tour workplaces handing out forms and chasing up workers in an unprecedented union drive to bolster support for the government. The plan to exploit new laws on postal voting was reached at a recent meeting of senior union and party figures on the Labour party's trade unions liaison committee, after a private presentation from No 10's private pollster, Philip Gould. Five of the biggest unions affiliated to the Labour party - Unison, AEEU, TGWU, MSF, and GMB - have undertaken to sign up between 65,000 and 80,000 postal voters. Smaller unions will provide the remainder of the votes. If successful, the strategy would give Mr Blair half a million votes before the ballot booths open on election day, and it could prove crucial in marginal constituencies, particularly in the West Midlands and north-west England. The initiative echoes the tactics of US unions, which delivered huge numbers of votes for Bill Clinton and Al Gore, and comes after Mr Gould discovered a big swing to Labour among union members. The unions' more central role in Labour's campaign compares with four years ago when Mr Blair wanted them kept in the background to reassure big business and blunt Tory attempts to revive memories of the winter of discontent. Prominent leaders, such as the AEEU's Sir Ken Jackson and the TGWU's Bill Morris, will be deployed to counter cynicism over the govern ment's record, and persuade traditional Labour supporters to back Mr Blair. The unions intend to set up phone banks to contact members and send them copies of an in-house journal listing Labour's achievements, including anti-crime and pro-family measures as well as the minimum wage and employment rights. \"The party hierarchy is completely relaxed about union involvement because scare stories will carry little or no weight,\" said an influential union official close to Millbank. \"We have a network still of 7m people _ most will vote Labour if only we get them to vote.\" With spending by political parties expected to be capped at under \u00a315m, non-financial contributions by organisations such as trade unions will be increasingly significant in election campaigns. Unions are likely to donate about \u00a38m to Labour and will provide extensive back-up with staff, offices and cars. The balloting drive follows a Home Office experiment during last spring's council elections which found that the most successful way to boost turnout was to ease restrictions on postal voting. Under the Political Parties Act electors will for the first time be able to demand a postal vote from their local council or returning officer without proving they are ill, on holiday or away working.

Not so for the foot soldiers of Alastair Campbell who have been ordered to break with tradition and begin running press launches of government initiatives at weekends. In a sure sign that a general election is looming, the government is preparing for a barrage of good news, seven days a week. A confidential memorandum from the strategic communications unit at No 10 refers to \"the prime minister's strong view that the government should make more use of weekends for substantive business\". It is critical of the conventional method of simply issuing a press notice through the central office of information on Saturdays and Sundays and says many \"good stories\" are being thrown away at weekends because they are not given the same \"impact and effort\" as a weekday launch. The memo suggests that events and initiatives during the week are being crowded out by the sheer weight of announcements. If government departments do not begin to schedule full press conferences on Saturdays and Sundays, then they will be allocated slots by No 10. The memo was sent by Paul Brown at the communications unit to the various government departments on February 13. It reads: \"The prime minister is determined to make this shift for business which does not require an announcement to parliament, not least to avoid the situation where weekdays are overcrowded with government events and initiatives competing for attention. \"If we cannot develop a good weekend forward programme quickly, decisions will have to be made here about what pieces of business might be suitable. \"The weekend media are keen to report news stories and we can get good value by using them. \"This depends on the story being handled properly, with proper detailed briefing and a minister up and about on the day available for interviews, visits, etc.\" A government source said the move was a matter of common sense. \"With the advent of 24 hour news, seven days a week, the government is under ever growing pressure to meet the demands of the media,\" he said. \"There is an endless desire for fresh news and stories and it makes sense to try to meet that demand.\" Making the most of the government's good news has not made everyone happy, however. A press officer in one government department said the memo had met with a furious reception. \"This has upset quite a lot of people who want their weekends off,\" he said. \"People are already working long hours and this is quite an extra burden. And you have to ask, do the electorate at large want this stuff rammed down their throats at weekends as well?\"",

If the local NHS trust could not do the operation within that time, it would have to pay for treatment at the time and hospital of the patients' choice. The patients would be free to choose a private hospital and the NHS would have to pay.

      "bodyText": "A new law to use civil powers to confiscate ill-gotten fortunes worth \u00a3220m from 39 big gangsters who have so far escaped criminal conviction was unveiled yesterday by the home secretary, Jack Straw. Mr Straw's draft proceeds of crime bill has attracted criticism from civil liberties groups. The bill, to be introduced later this year, would set up a criminal assets recovery agency charged with the task of hunting down cash, houses, cars and other wealth accumulated through criminal activity. It is estimated that up to \u00a3650m a year might be generated through criminal activity in Britain, while only \u00a344m was seized last year under current powers. The 335 clause draft bill published yesterday confirmed that the courts would be able to issue confiscation orders using a lower standard of proof - the balance of probabilities - rather than the criminal test of \"proving beyond reasonable doubt\" that the assets concerned are the profits of criminal activity. But the legislation does not go as far as was originally feared by civil liberties groups and reverse the burden of proof so that the accused would have to prove that their wealth was legitimately acquired. Mr Straw said that \u00a354m would be spent on setting up the criminal assets recovery agency, which could be in business as early as next year. \"There are individuals and families who are well known to the police as people who are organisers of large-scale criminal rackets. \"They may have begun their criminal activity many years ago but by one means or another have managed to detach themselves from the commission of offences. They have therefore made proceedings against them very difficult and yet they have large houses and cars and live in a wealthy way but give no reasonable explanation as to how they came by their assets,\" said Mr Straw.

The air force's own board of inquiry said a major technical malfunction could not be ruled out, but two air marshals overruled the board and blamed the pilots.</p> <p>The last full investigation into the crash was a Scottish fatal accident inquiry under Sheriff Sir Stephen Young which ruled in 1996 that there was no evidence to suggest that Flt. Lts Capper and Cook were to blame. But the terms of the inquiry prevented it challenging the gross negligence verdict. The MoD has refused to consider reviewing the verdict, despite the emergence of a catalogue of evidence of serious technical malfunctions in the newly upgraded Chinook fleet.</p> <p>Some of the evidence - including an accident in the US involving a MoD Chinook, was known at the time. Some emerged later after repeated allegations by MPs that they had been mislead by successive defence ministers.</p> <p>The campaign to overturn the verdict has been driven by Tony Collins, executive editor of Computer Weekly, who has unearthed a stream of internal MoD documents pointing to serious problems with the computerised engine control system, known as Fadec, which was installed in the Chinook fleet before the crash.</p> <p>Last week the Guardian and Computer Weekly revealed that two leaked internal documents showed that the RAF was aware that technical problems experienced in the Chinooks could have endangered the safety of an aircraft.</p> <p>Yesterday the paper and the magazine produced evidence that ministers had misled MP's and the public by claiming erroneously that a 1998 defence select committee report endorsed the official version of events.</p> <p>The Lords committee which is backed by a number of peers, including two former law lords, comes amid a growing clamour for a new inquiry into the loss of Chinook ZD576. In November the Commons public accounts committee threw its weight behind the campaign. It accused the MoD of \"unwarrantable arrogance\", employing \"flawed logic\" and adopting \"incredible\" and \"shocking\" test procedures when it brought the new Chinooks into service in 1994 against the advice of its test pilots.</p> <p>Lord Chalfont, a former Labour foreign affairs minister, and his fellow campaigners believe the Lords inquiry will offer ministers a way of saving face on an issue on which it has had to rely on the advice of MoD officials and serving military officers.</p> <p>Lord Chalfont told the Lords last night: \"A number of distinguished and experienced people, including judges, aviation and computer experts, former ministers and politicians of all parties, have the gravest doubts. Only two air marshals and their colleagues in the MoD apparently have no doubt at all.\"</p> <p>He added: \"It is on their subjective judgment that two outstanding special forces pilots have been found guilty of making a joint decision to risk their own lives and those of the passengers.\"</p> <p>Since the crash the RAF has changed the rules and will no longer blame dead pilots.</p> <p>Mike Tapper, the father of Jonathan Tapper, said he looked forward to evidence being heard in public over his son's death.</p> <p>\"It offers families a chance to have this matter fully aired in public. It also gives us the chance to hear from the two air marshals and how it was they came to their findings.\"</p>",

The last full investigation into the crash was a Scottish fatal accident inquiry under Sheriff Sir Stephen Young which ruled in 1996 that there was no evidence to suggest that Flt. Lts Capper and Cook were to blame. But the terms of the inquiry prevented it challenging the gross negligence verdict. The MoD has refused to consider reviewing the verdict, despite the emergence of a catalogue of evidence of serious technical malfunctions in the newly upgraded Chinook fleet. Some of the evidence - including an accident in the US involving a MoD Chinook, was known at the time. Some emerged later after repeated allegations by MPs that they had been mislead by successive defence ministers. The campaign to overturn the verdict has been driven by Tony Collins, executive editor of Computer Weekly, who has unearthed a stream of internal MoD documents pointing to serious problems with the computerised engine control system, known as Fadec, which was installed in the Chinook fleet before the crash. Last week the Guardian and Computer Weekly revealed that two leaked internal documents showed that the RAF was aware that technical problems experienced in the Chinooks could have endangered the safety of an aircraft. Yesterday the paper and the magazine produced evidence that ministers had misled MP's and the public by claiming erroneously that a 1998 defence select committee report endorsed the official version of events. The Lords committee which is backed by a number of peers, including two former law lords, comes amid a growing clamour for a new inquiry into the loss of Chinook ZD576. In November the Commons public accounts committee threw its weight behind the campaign. It accused the MoD of \"unwarrantable arrogance\", employing \"flawed logic\" and adopting \"incredible\" and \"shocking\" test procedures when it brought the new Chinooks into service in 1994 against the advice of its test pilots. Lord Chalfont, a former Labour foreign affairs minister, and his fellow campaigners believe the Lords inquiry will offer ministers a way of saving face on an issue on which it has had to rely on the advice of MoD officials and serving military officers. Lord Chalfont told the Lords last night: \"A number of distinguished and experienced people, including judges, aviation and computer experts, former ministers and politicians of all parties, have the gravest doubts. Only two air marshals and their colleagues in the MoD apparently have no doubt at all.\" He added: \"It is on their subjective judgment that two outstanding special forces pilots have been found guilty of making a joint decision to risk their own lives and those of the passengers.\" Since the crash the RAF has changed the rules and will no longer blame dead pilots. Mike Tapper, the father of Jonathan Tapper, said he looked forward to evidence being heard in public over his son's death. \"It offers families a chance to have this matter fully aired in public. It also gives us the chance to hear from the two air marshals and how it was they came to their findings.\"",

With an annual bursary of \u00a36,800, the 24-year-old has to have another job to supplement her income - a familiar story - and so she does laboratory supervision with undergraduate chemistry students. At \u00a39 an hour, she is one of the new army of part-time teaching staff which has been drafted in to cope as student numbers soar and university budgets are squeezed. </p> <p>Down the road, at Sheffield Hallam University, Jillian Newton is doing the same as she works towards a PhD in analytical chemistry. She, on the other hand, is paid \u00a320 an hour. </p> <p>The wide and apparently arbitrary differences in pay and conditions for part-time staff are revealed in a survey by Christopher Husbands of the London School of Economics and Annette Davies of the Cardiff Business School. Rates for demonstrators - who help lecturers with practical experiments - varied from \u00a33.65 to \u00a323.89 an hour. More worrying were the ways in which an unregulated system leaves part-time staff open to exploitation, putting them under pressure to work long hours in the hope of gaining an academic post. </p> <p>Husbands and Davies surveyed the academic personnel officers of 22 universities to obtain information about the numbers of particular types of part-timer at each university and the terms and conditions of their employment. The findings make disturbing reading. </p> <p>Abbott says demonstration work is not part of her contract but there is a \"culture of expectation\" within her faculty that postgraduates will take it on: \"If the postgraduates did not do the demonstrations there would be nobody to look after the students, and presumably some of practical classes would not take place.\" A quick three-hour course was all that was deemed necessary to train her to become a demonstrator. She now does 71 hours of laboratory demonstration each semester, about eight hours a week. </p> <p>But Abbott's \u00a39 an hour cannot be taken at face value because of the preparation and marking time involved. At first the preparation used to take two hours a week but now, as she becomes more used to her role, it takes only 30 minutes. It is the marking of student laboratory scripts that eats into her hourly rate. She is paid \u00a340 a semester for this marking, which takes about five hours a week. This is an improvement - it used to be eight hours a week, but after complaints by the demonstrators the workload was spread out and the time spent on it reduced. </p> <p>Given the extra hours involved, then, Abbott's hourly rate comes in somewhere between \u00a35-6 an hour. She's not grumbling. \"It is better than working in a pub and I don't mind helping the university. I have pride in my university and I want it to do well.\" </p> <p>She might not be so accommodating if she were to look at the rates of pay for demonstrators at Sheffield Hallam. Jillian Newton, 35, also needs to supplement her \u00a36,500 bursarybut is paid more than twice as much as Abbott. She did only eight hours of demonstration work last semester and has an allocation of 18 hours for the present one. The training was more extensive at Sheffield Hallam: Newton had to attend a course one day a week for four weeks before she was allowed to supervise students. </p> <p>\"If the work is there you just do it, because somebody has to,\" she says. \"I am responsible for 20 students and the hard part of the job is marking the formal laboratory reports and question books which take about three hours a week. </p> <p>\"Preparation work takes me a couple of nights, about three to six hours reading around the topic and discussing with the lecturers. I receive no extra pay for this, so I suppose the rate of pay is less than \u00a320 per hour.\" </p> <p>Roger Allum, the head of Sheffield University's public relations department, says that the postgraduate demonstrators in their chemistry laboratories are paid on a standard inter-university scale: \"Annie Abbott will be being paid at the bottom point of the Research and Analogous 1B scale which gives her a rate of pay of \u00a39.30 an hour. This is a common scale used by most universities. But if your findings hold up, I imagine our demon strators will be knocking on our doors asking for a pay rise.\" </p> <p>Laura Mark of Sheffield Hallam's publicity and marketing department says: \"Demonstrators are paid on a scale used for associate lecturers and that ranges between about \u00a317 and \u00a327. Where they fit in on that scale is determined by the school that they are working for and depends on the type of work they are carrying out and the level of involvement.\" </p> <p>The problems seem to stem from the fact that there are no agreed pay scales for part-time teachers in universities. The survey points out that on such issues as pay there is a lack of uniformity \"that seems never to have received any legal challenge, even though it might, in certain circumstances, be actionable from an equal opportunities perspective.\" Hourly rates of pay for demonstrators in 1997 varied between institutions from \u00a33.65 to \u00a323.80, while the rate for small group teaching ranged from \u00a37.65 to \u00a323.89. The differences in rates for formal lecturing were even more marked, ranging from \u00a313.80 to \u00a370 an hour. </p> <p>Marking and setting exam scripts is another area in which postgraduate part-timers were getting a raw deal - 64% of the reporting institutions made no extra payments for setting examinations over and above the hourly teaching rate, and 50% said that the marking of scripts was included within that rate. In three-quarters of the universities, postgraduates were not paid for marking coursework. In only 7% was additional payment made for preparation time for the teaching undertaken. </p> <p>Even in those institutions that seemed to be paying a reasonable hourly rate, the reality was different when all the unpaid work was taken into account. Some part-timers are expected to hold up to three \"office\" hours a week, times when they must be available to answer problems and questions from students. </p> <p>What's more, the appointment of part-time teachers does not appear to adhere to any consistent selection criteria. The survey points out that \"despite legislative guidelines attempting to reduce arbitrariness in such forms of employment, [the selection] is in the gift of more powerful academics, who may . . . favour their own supervisees\". </p> <p>Some universities use an indenture model of employment. Postgraduate students doing a higher degree receive full or partial coverage of tuition fees. In return the student must teach undergraduates. These duties are supposed to be for a fixed number of hours a week, but extra teaching may be difficult to resist, says the report, because of \"the power differential between the teacher and the senior academic enforcing the extra allocation\". </p> <p>The news is not uniformly gloomy. The survey also showed up the differences in the treatment of part-time teachers by new and old universities. Older universities are more likely to have better provision for improving the teaching abilities of their part-timers, although this is patchy and taken up on a voluntary basis. On the other hand, the new universities are more likely to offer contracts and letters of appointment as well as to carry out formal gender and ethnicity monitoring. Husbands and Davies believe that the new universities have \"adopted a more professional approach to the terms and conditions aspects of part-time teachers.\" </p> <p>The plight of part-time university teachers has not escaped attention in the past. The Higher Education Quality Council noted the problem in two audit reports in the mid-1990s: \"In several institutions, part-time staff were playing a significant role. However, they were often at a disadvantage in respect of access to development and training opportunities compared to full-time colleagues. Also, their administrative and tutorial roles were not always properly acknowledged.\" </p> <p>Little has changed. </p> <p>The report by CT Husbands &amp; A Davies on The teaching roles, institutional locations and terms and conditions of employment of part-time teachers in UK higher education, is in the Journal of Further and Higher Education 24(3)</p>",

In three-quarters of the universities, postgraduates were not paid for marking coursework. In only 7% was additional payment made for preparation time for the teaching undertaken. Even in those institutions that seemed to be paying a reasonable hourly rate, the reality was different when all the unpaid work was taken into account. Some part-timers are expected to hold up to three \"office\" hours a week, times when they must be available to answer problems and questions from students. What's more, the appointment of part-time teachers does not appear to adhere to any consistent selection criteria. The survey points out that \"despite legislative guidelines attempting to reduce arbitrariness in such forms of employment, [the selection] is in the gift of more powerful academics, who may . . . favour their own supervisees\". Some universities use an indenture model of employment. Postgraduate students doing a higher degree receive full or partial coverage of tuition fees. In return the student must teach undergraduates. These duties are supposed to be for a fixed number of hours a week, but extra teaching may be difficult to resist, says the report, because of \"the power differential between the teacher and the senior academic enforcing the extra allocation\". The news is not uniformly gloomy. The survey also showed up the differences in the treatment of part-time teachers by new and old universities. Older universities are more likely to have better provision for improving the teaching abilities of their part-timers, although this is patchy and taken up on a voluntary basis. On the other hand, the new universities are more likely to offer contracts and letters of appointment as well as to carry out formal gender and ethnicity monitoring. Husbands and Davies believe that the new universities have \"adopted a more professional approach to the terms and conditions aspects of part-time teachers.\" The plight of part-time university teachers has not escaped attention in the past. The Higher Education Quality Council noted the problem in two audit reports in the mid-1990s: \"In several institutions, part-time staff were playing a significant role. However, they were often at a disadvantage in respect of access to development and training opportunities compared to full-time colleagues. Also, their administrative and tutorial roles were not always properly acknowledged.\" Little has changed. The report by CT Husbands &amp; A Davies on The teaching roles, institutional locations and terms and conditions of employment of part-time teachers in UK higher education, is in the Journal of Further and Higher Education 24(3)",

      "body": "<p>In his drive to attract more talented inner city children into the best universities, education secretary David Blunkett is considering the introduction of American-style aptitude tests for sixth-formers. Since Laura Spence ended up at Harvard after being rejected by Oxford last year, arguments over access have generated considerable heat. The latest attempt to shed more light on the issue came last week with a pilot study financed by Peter Lampl, a millionaire philanthropist who has been immensely influential in setting the Blair government's agenda on access. </p> <p>Lampl believes the study shows that at least some children attending poorly performing schools would stand a better chance of being considered on the basis of aptitude tests than they would on A-level results. </p> <p>But ironically this enthusiasm comes at a time when American universities are voicing concerns that Scholastic Aptitude Tests have the opposite effect - giving well-off students at good schools an unfair advantage. </p> <p>On this side of the Atlantic, vice-chancellors are deeply divided about how useful aptitude tests would be. </p> <p>The study, commissioned by Lampl's Sutton Trust, tested 1,300 students at high-achieving and low-achieving schools from around the UK and compared their A-level results. Potentially, bright students from low-achieving schools could be helped into university, the report by the National Foundation for Educational Research concludes. \"For low attaining schools [aptitude tests] would lead to an extra 25 pupils from the sample being considered [for university], increasing the percentage of pupils considered from the schools from 4% to 8% (a 100% increase).\" </p> <p>However, the report does not argue that tests would automatically eradicate social disadvantages. Children with parents in professional and managerial occupations did best at both aptitude tests and A-levels. Also, boys tended to do better in the tests than girls. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the president of the University of California, Richard Atkinson, sparked debate in the US when he announced last month that he wanted his university to stop using SATs, the standard American university entrance exam. </p> <p>Atkinson believes the aptitude test is \"distorting educational priorities\". American schools devote time specifically to studying for the aptitude test and anxious parents spend money on extracurricular coaching. Students facing the test memorise long tables of synonyms and practise algebraic questions. Despite evidence that it does not help exam performance, this relentless mugging-up continues. </p> <p>Although last-ditch swotting might not help, Atkinson clearly believes that better schools get better SATs when he suggests that a broader record of scholastic achievement would allow more children from disadvantaged schools to make it to university. </p> <p>Because he represents one of the largest US institutions (with 170,000 students), Atkinson's decision rocked American parents and high schools, where \"the test\" has come to dominate. Although he avoids calling his plans affirmative action to help disadvantaged children, the implication is clear. He thinks that a greater diversity of children will make it to the University of California as a result of the change. </p> <p>There have been fierce arguments about whether dropping SATs could directly help ethnic minority students in the United States gain equal access to universities. On average, black students score 198 points less than white applicants. </p> <p>The UK pilot scheme found no evidence that candidates' test scores varied according to their race; but the Laura Spence debate means that universities are taking the idea of aptitude testing seriously. </p> <p>Warwick University, for instance, which has stiff competition for places, investigated the American example but is now extremely dubious about aptitude testing. Dr Katherine Lloyd Clark, the assistant registrar, made two visits to the US and spoke to eight leading universities about the SATs. She was told that fewer than 20% of entrance decisions are based on test results. The prospect of yet more testing in schools also helped put her off the idea: \"We are not convinced aptitude tests are the best idea. We need something that gives us a rounded view of a student. Also, at the moment it's just testing, testing, testing. These kids have been tested all the way down the line. It isn't in their best interest.\" </p> <p>Clark believes the money it would cost to set up aptitude tests could be better spent by Warwick University on developing other means of selecting candidates. \"There is much more work in the UK to be done benchmarking candidates against other students in the same school, rather than just looking at their grades. We're thinking about building up a database of information about schools and students, particularly in the Midlands.\" </p> <p>Other universities share that con cern about introducing more testing. Sussex University's vice-chancellor, Professor Alasdair Smith, says: \"While more tests might provide a better overall picture of the abilities of potential students, we have to be very careful about the proliferation of exams and tests. Students in secondary education are already over-tested.\" </p> <p>For most courses where competition is not intense, the attempt to introduce a standardised and competitive selection process could be counterproductive, according to Professor Roderick Floud, provost of London Guildhall University and president elect of Universities UK, which represents 122 executive heads of UK higher education institutions. \"You can't have standardised admissions processes if you don't have a standardised course system,\" says Floud. </p> <p>He argues that where competition is intense, universities need to use every available means, including potentially the right sort of aptitude test, to differentiate between candidates. But, for most courses, the question is irrelevant. \"In most cases, we're not talking about the selection of a few candidates for a few places, we're talking about matching many students to many courses. There it's a two-way process where the university has a responsibility to make information about themselves public. Both sides discover whether they suit each other. It's like courtship and marriage,\" says Prof Floud. </p> <p>Professor Rick Trainor, the US-educated vice-chancellor of Greenwich University, believes aptitude tests could be useful in the UK: \"While I suspect that there's no test that just measures ability without including educational achievement, my bet is that an aptitude test for the UK context could be developed. There is room for empirical research.\" </p> <p>What Trainor finds particularly galling is the idea that such tests should be reserved for elite institutions or courses. \"An unfortunate aspect of the discussion of access to universities is that it's only been about 'leading' universities. If aptitude tests make sense for leading universities in a complementary way to A-levels then they are going to be useful for all universities. Any university would like as much relevant information as possible.\" </p> <p>Edinburgh University's principal agrees that aptitude tests have the potential to help children from low-achieving schools. Professor Sir Stewart Sutherland thinks they could ensure that students who could benefit most from university actually got in: \"We have to devise ways of testing potential students who haven't come through ordinary routes. I am convinced there is talent out there not being accessed. Aptitude testing has to be taken very seriously indeed, but we would have to be convinced that the methods work.\" </p> <p>In Sutherland's view, arguments about selection obscure the real argument in university entrance. Something prevents some bright children from becoming high-achieving students, and it is that \"something\" which has to be removed, regardless of the selection process. </p> <p>\"None of this should distract from finding out what prevents students at the starting blocks from making it to us. What is it that is happening down the track that is disadvantaging potential students?\" </p> <p> A Pilot of Aptitude Testing for University Entrance from the National Foundation for Educational Research costs \u00a311 and can be obtained from <a href=\"http://www.suttontrust.com\">www.suttontrust.com</a> or 020-8788 3223 </p> <p><strong>Try a SAT</strong></p> <p>Innovative museums ______ the education of visitors as a goal, while the more traditional institutions ______ anything but collecting and categorizing objects. </p> <p>A recruit...diminish </p> <p>B entertain...utilize </p> <p>C expel...include </p> <p>D eliminate...replace </p> <p>E include...discourage </p> <p>A rectangular garden covers an area of 2,500 sq ft and is divided into square plots 6 ft on a side.

Children with parents in professional and managerial occupations did best at both aptitude tests and A-levels. Also, boys tended to do better in the tests than girls. Meanwhile, the president of the University of California, Richard Atkinson, sparked debate in the US when he announced last month that he wanted his university to stop using SATs, the standard American university entrance exam. Atkinson believes the aptitude test is \"distorting educational priorities\". American schools devote time specifically to studying for the aptitude test and anxious parents spend money on extracurricular coaching. Students facing the test memorise long tables of synonyms and practise algebraic questions. Despite evidence that it does not help exam performance, this relentless mugging-up continues. Although last-ditch swotting might not help, Atkinson clearly believes that better schools get better SATs when he suggests that a broader record of scholastic achievement would allow more children from disadvantaged schools to make it to university. Because he represents one of the largest US institutions (with 170,000 students), Atkinson's decision rocked American parents and high schools, where \"the test\" has come to dominate. Although he avoids calling his plans affirmative action to help disadvantaged children, the implication is clear. He thinks that a greater diversity of children will make it to the University of California as a result of the change. There have been fierce arguments about whether dropping SATs could directly help ethnic minority students in the United States gain equal access to universities. On average, black students score 198 points less than white applicants. The UK pilot scheme found no evidence that candidates' test scores varied according to their race; but the Laura Spence debate means that universities are taking the idea of aptitude testing seriously. Warwick University, for instance, which has stiff competition for places, investigated the American example but is now extremely dubious about aptitude testing. Dr Katherine Lloyd Clark, the assistant registrar, made two visits to the US and spoke to eight leading universities about the SATs. She was told that fewer than 20% of entrance decisions are based on test results. The prospect of yet more testing in schools also helped put her off the idea: \"We are not convinced aptitude tests are the best idea. We need something that gives us a rounded view of a student. Also, at the moment it's just testing, testing, testing. These kids have been tested all the way down the line. It isn't in their best interest.\" Clark believes the money it would cost to set up aptitude tests could be better spent by Warwick University on developing other means of selecting candidates. \"There is much more work in the UK to be done benchmarking candidates against other students in the same school, rather than just looking at their grades. We're thinking about building up a database of information about schools and students, particularly in the Midlands.\" Other universities share that con cern about introducing more testing. Sussex University's vice-chancellor, Professor Alasdair Smith, says: \"While more tests might provide a better overall picture of the abilities of potential students, we have to be very careful about the proliferation of exams and tests. Students in secondary education are already over-tested.\" For most courses where competition is not intense, the attempt to introduce a standardised and competitive selection process could be counterproductive, according to Professor Roderick Floud, provost of London Guildhall University and president elect of Universities UK, which represents 122 executive heads of UK higher education institutions. \"You can't have standardised admissions processes if you don't have a standardised course system,\" says Floud. He argues that where competition is intense, universities need to use every available means, including potentially the right sort of aptitude test, to differentiate between candidates. But, for most courses, the question is irrelevant. \"In most cases, we're not talking about the selection of a few candidates for a few places, we're talking about matching many students to many courses. There it's a two-way process where the university has a responsibility to make information about themselves public. Both sides discover whether they suit each other. It's like courtship and marriage,\" says Prof Floud. Professor Rick Trainor, the US-educated vice-chancellor of Greenwich University, believes aptitude tests could be useful in the UK: \"While I suspect that there's no test that just measures ability without including educational achievement, my bet is that an aptitude test for the UK context could be developed. There is room for empirical research.\" What Trainor finds particularly galling is the idea that such tests should be reserved for elite institutions or courses. \"An unfortunate aspect of the discussion of access to universities is that it's only been about 'leading' universities. If aptitude tests make sense for leading universities in a complementary way to A-levels then they are going to be useful for all universities. Any university would like as much relevant information as possible.\" Edinburgh University's principal agrees that aptitude tests have the potential to help children from low-achieving schools. Professor Sir Stewart Sutherland thinks they could ensure that students who could benefit most from university actually got in: \"We have to devise ways of testing potential students who haven't come through ordinary routes. I am convinced there is talent out there not being accessed. Aptitude testing has to be taken very seriously indeed, but we would have to be convinced that the methods work.\" In Sutherland's view, arguments about selection obscure the real argument in university entrance. Something prevents some bright children from becoming high-achieving students, and it is that \"something\" which has to be removed, regardless of the selection process. \"None of this should distract from finding out what prevents students at the starting blocks from making it to us. What is it that is happening down the track that is disadvantaging potential students?\" A Pilot of Aptitude Testing for University Entrance from the National Foundation for Educational Research costs \u00a311 and can be obtained from www.suttontrust.com or 020-8788 3223 Try a SAT Innovative museums ______ the education of visitors as a goal, while the more traditional institutions ______ anything but collecting and categorizing objects.

      "body": "<p>There is widespread recognition that the government's education reforms have been successful. Standards in literacy and numeracy at primary level have risen dramatically. GCSE and A-level results are up. School failure and local education authority underperformance have been firmly tackled. Of course there is still much to do. We need to see through the changes at primary level and build on them at secondary level to modernise the comprehensive system and deliver higher standards. But perhaps the most important changes of all are in the culture of the education service. The old despair that characterised the education service before 1997 is being replaced by a can-do culture. As a result of the remarkable progress at primary level, there is a new belief that rapid, fundamental reform can be achieved. </p> <p>In bringing about these changes I have sought to strike the right balance between driving change from the centre and decentralising decision-making to schools. Getting this right is a difficult issue of public policy not just in education. It is also the case that the balance can be changed over time. In education, for example, what we inherited in 1997 cried out for a clear vision. Leadership was required at national, as well as at education authority and school level. Now that the culture has changed significantly, the same clear vision and sense of direction can be pursued through a new partnership with schools and local education authorities. </p> <p>Let me illustrate. I make no apologies for the prescription in the literacy and numeracy strategies. We had to deal with the failure of teacher training over decades. Primary teachers wanted to teach mental arithmetic, to embrace phonics and to ensure high standards of grammar and spelling but there had been no attempt to enable them to do so. Our strategies have put that right and as a result of teachers' efforts primary schools have been transformed. </p> <p>Similarly, we had to deal with the challenge of failing schools. In 1997 I was appalled at the way so many failing schools had been neglected. The life chances of thousands of children were at stake. Now, as a result of our tough central prescription and the efforts of local authorities, 667 schools have been successfully turned round, another 123 have been closed and a small number given a Fresh Start. We have taken an equally robust approach to failing local authorities with similar success. Ofsted reported recently that \"there were considerable signs of improvement this year across a wide range of functions . . .\" </p> <p>The results of these three central interventions speak for themselves. Without them we would not have made nearly as much progress but I have never taken the view that central direction was the only way. </p> <p>In fact, while these centrally driven policies have been working through, I have simultaneously been devolving more power, funding and responsibility to schools. We now delegate 84% of the education budget to schools, up from 79% in 1997. Heads welcome the opportunity this gives them to make decisions at school level. </p> <p>The dilemma for many on the right is that they want intervention where they regard it as important but in the same breath proclaim the virtues of \"free schools\". The real world is rather more complex and demands a balance of the sort that we are achieving. </p> <p>The fundamental premise, as made clear in 1997, has always been \"intervention in inverse proportion to success\". Now that we have much greater success and a more positive culture, we can develop, as we put it in the green paper published on February 12, a new sense of partnership. The foundations are in place for the next stage of reform. </p> <p>We will enhance autonomy for successful schools. The new light-touch inspection approach should become the norm for those that demonstrate continuous success. We want a more diverse system too, with each secondary school developing its own ethos and mission and many becoming specialist or Beacon Schools. </p> <p>Schools are increasingly determined to seek best practice and innovative ideas from each other. Central government will continue to intervene on behalf of pupils if necessary but, increasingly, its central tasks will be to create a climate in which everyone works together to achieve world-class performance.</p>",

      "bodyText": "There is widespread recognition that the government's education reforms have been successful. Standards in literacy and numeracy at primary level have risen dramatically. GCSE and A-level results are up. School failure and local education authority underperformance have been firmly tackled. Of course there is still much to do. We need to see through the changes at primary level and build on them at secondary level to modernise the comprehensive system and deliver higher standards. But perhaps the most important changes of all are in the culture of the education service. The old despair that characterised the education service before 1997 is being replaced by a can-do culture. As a result of the remarkable progress at primary level, there is a new belief that rapid, fundamental reform can be achieved. In bringing about these changes I have sought to strike the right balance between driving change from the centre and decentralising decision-making to schools. Getting this right is a difficult issue of public policy not just in education. It is also the case that the balance can be changed over time. In education, for example, what we inherited in 1997 cried out for a clear vision. Leadership was required at national, as well as at education authority and school level. Now that the culture has changed significantly, the same clear vision and sense of direction can be pursued through a new partnership with schools and local education authorities. Let me illustrate. I make no apologies for the prescription in the literacy and numeracy strategies. We had to deal with the failure of teacher training over decades. Primary teachers wanted to teach mental arithmetic, to embrace phonics and to ensure high standards of grammar and spelling but there had been no attempt to enable them to do so. Our strategies have put that right and as a result of teachers' efforts primary schools have been transformed. Similarly, we had to deal with the challenge of failing schools. In 1997 I was appalled at the way so many failing schools had been neglected. The life chances of thousands of children were at stake. Now, as a result of our tough central prescription and the efforts of local authorities, 667 schools have been successfully turned round, another 123 have been closed and a small number given a Fresh Start. We have taken an equally robust approach to failing local authorities with similar success. Ofsted reported recently that \"there were considerable signs of improvement this year across a wide range of functions . . .\" The results of these three central interventions speak for themselves. Without them we would not have made nearly as much progress but I have never taken the view that central direction was the only way. In fact, while these centrally driven policies have been working through, I have simultaneously been devolving more power, funding and responsibility to schools. We now delegate 84% of the education budget to schools, up from 79% in 1997. Heads welcome the opportunity this gives them to make decisions at school level. The dilemma for many on the right is that they want intervention where they regard it as important but in the same breath proclaim the virtues of \"free schools\". The real world is rather more complex and demands a balance of the sort that we are achieving. The fundamental premise, as made clear in 1997, has always been \"intervention in inverse proportion to success\". Now that we have much greater success and a more positive culture, we can develop, as we put it in the green paper published on February 12, a new sense of partnership. The foundations are in place for the next stage of reform. We will enhance autonomy for successful schools. The new light-touch inspection approach should become the norm for those that demonstrate continuous success. We want a more diverse system too, with each secondary school developing its own ethos and mission and many becoming specialist or Beacon Schools. Schools are increasingly determined to seek best practice and innovative ideas from each other. Central government will continue to intervene on behalf of pupils if necessary but, increasingly, its central tasks will be to create a climate in which everyone works together to achieve world-class performance.",

      "body": "<p>Amid the more widespread concerns for British farming, many parents will have permitted themselves a wry smile at reports that the farm at the centre of the foot and mouth outbreak had fed its pigs on leftover school dinners. After all, what better confection to turn the little piggies into proper porkers than that which has transformed the nation's children into Europe's newly crowned top chubsters? </p> <p>If you check out the average school canteen, it doesn't take long to work out how Britain achieved its pre-eminence in the obesity stakes. The queues for the burgers, chips and pizza stretch round the block, while the one for the better-value \"healthy option\", which may even include the odd vegetable, is eerily empty. And if you do come across someone choosing the healthy option, the chances are it is only because the pizza has run out. In the battle for the hearts and tums of our children, the multibillion-pound fast food industry is winning hands down. </p> <p>It's not all bad news, though. Most food experts believe that standards have risen, albeit slowly, in the aftermath of the BSE crisis and from the beginning of next month the deregulation of school dinners will come to an end. From April 1, headteachers will be held to account for the service they provide and the school meals must meet minimum nutritional standards and offer pupils balance, variety and choice. </p> <p>\"To be honest,\" says Joe Harvey, director of the Health Education Trust, \"the minimum standards won't trouble most caterers. Where they will have an impact is on those authorities that only provide packed lunches as it will be hard to providevariety and choice without costing a great deal more.\" </p> <p>Eating well is not just about physical well-being; a balanced healthy diet has been proven to have knock-on benefits, such as improved concentration, and there are indications that additives can contribute to behavioural difficulties. So how come schools don't just sling all the junk off the menu? The answer is money. Remove burgers and pizzas and the kids will bunk off to McDonald's, and no caterer is going to pitch for a contract to serve just a handful of kids. </p> <p>Moreover, with free meals pegged to a budget of \u00a31.25, there is a limit to just how exotic a school dinner can be. So rather than tasty M&amp;S bangers, you tend to get sausages filled with a slurry of pig and chicken bones, aka mechanically recovered meat (MRM). </p> <p>There are links between low-income families and obesity, and many kids certainly have their poor eating habits reinforced at home, but few school children are so dim they don't know the difference between healthy and unhealthy eating. The point is they don't care; they are still young enough to believe themselves immortal. So how do you get children to recognise the long-term benefits and opt for the pasta and salad instead of a wedge of super-saturated pizza? </p> <p>\"One shouldn't automatically assume that pizza is an unhealthy option,\" counters Luci Daniels, the independent state-registered dietician who sat on the committee that advised the government on the new school meals standards, and who monitored the food diaries of our five guinea-pigs (right). \"If combined with other foods, pizza can be a healthy choice. If all school meals were low-fat foods, children wouldn't get their required calorific intake. Nor should we put all the blame for unhealthy eating on the schools. Many kids don't eat a proper breakfast, which encourages them to snack throughout the day.\" </p> <p>Positive role models are often cited as the best hope. Joe Harvey believes that it is too late to change the habits of many secondary school kids, but primary schools are there for the taking.

Ballots in Manchester, Nottingham, Kent, Portsmouth, Southampton, Leicester, Middlesbrough and Reading close next week, with the results expected to go the same way. </p> <p>And at the end of last week, the NUT announced plans to ballot its members in Hertfordshire, Sandwell, Hartlepool, Ipswich, Liverpool, Barnsley, the Medway Towns and Rochdale.

But I certainly don't want teachers having to double-up classes and take other shortcuts with the kids' education.

Jane Martin, whose son attends a primary school in south London, last week contacted the school's head for reassurance. \"She said that at the moment they were OK, but the slightest thing could mean they'd have to go on a four-day week - sickness or maternity leave could be enough. </p> <p>\"The thought of children being sent home fills me with dread.

Teachers have agreed to abandon long-arranged days away for courses if the result would be no cover and children sent home. </p> <p>Action by the NUT and the NASUWT will kick in immediately on such pre-arranged absences. Pat Maguire in the NUT's regional office in Doncaster says that everyone is waiting to see where the over-stretched supply system will crack first. A Roman Catholic primary is one front-runner in Doncaster; a high school with an obdurate \"hard-to-fill\" vacancy is another. </p> <p>Stephen Fletcher, head of Sherwood Park primary in Bexley, Kent, is keeping a close eye on the situation following the Greater London ballot. \"We're not thinking about a four-day week at the moment, because we've got no vacancies or missing staff, but I know we're extremely lucky,\" he says. Neighbouring schools are not so fortunate. \"Secondary schools in Bexley are already discussing the possibility of a four-day week. I can see it happening. Holes will appear all over the place.\" </p> <p>Other heads are optimistic that short-term gaps can be plugged. But the pressures underlying the unions' decision to ballot point to classroom shutdowns before the end of March. </p> <p>\"To try to keep continuity for the children, we book supply teachers months ahead from a pool of people we know,\" says Sewell. \"But there are only so many, and the demand can be huge. You might get a course which takes a teacher - in some cases two - from each of Doncaster's 130 schools. Just that means 200 supply teachers in one go.\" </p> <p>The town's director of education, Matthew Simpson, has taken the first step in a limited emergency plan by writing to every recently retired teacher - several thousand of them - still living reasonably nearby to ask for supply stints. The problem is exacerbated, he says, by the fact that Inland Revenue rules allow recently retired teachers only so many days' work per year, and many of the regulars have used up their quota so close to the end of the tax year. </p> <p>Some may simply not wish to return to the classroom. John Coe, of the National Association of Primary Education, runs a returners' course for former teachers. \"The trained teachers are out there, but most of them won't come back,\" he says. \"Stressed teachers are not the best thing for children. And stress means that occasional absences mount and the need for supply teachers is even greater.\" </p> <p>Maguire predicts that \"challenging schools\" - in socially and economically deprived areas or with difficult pupils - will be among the first to have send-homes, as supply colleagues opt for easier billets. It's a view shared by Alan Carter, a parent and school governor in north London. \"What worries me is that it is the most disadvantaged schools in the most de prived areas which will be the worst affected, when they are the ones least able to cope. They are the schools that are finding it hard to fill vacancies, so the impact will be worse.\" </p> <p>Mike Townsend and his colleague Bob Johnson, whose high schools at Balby Carr and Don Valley both have \"demanding\" pupils on their 1,450-strong rolls, are taking measures common across the affected LEAs. But the first and most obvious one, of prioritising exam-year pupils, is a stark illustration of the pressures which the unions blame for the current crisis. </p> <p>\"We'll protect year nine because they're coming up to Sats,\" says Johnson. \"Then there's year 11 doing GCSEs this summer and year 13 doing A-levels.\" Townsend chips in: \"And year 12 doing AS-levels,\" leaving both computing briefly just how many years are not priority cases now. </p> <p>John Dunford, general secretary of the Secondary Heads Association, is concerned that the action could add to the strains that schools are already suffering: \"This will make life more difficult because it introduces tensions between heads and their staff.\" </p> <p>\"The head has to tread very carefully,\" agrees Fletcher. \"The child's education must not suffer. But you need to work with your teachers and be able to explain the situation to them. Morale is still very low.\" </p> <p>Many heads are optimistic about avoiding send-homes, but Maguire believes that schools will be gradually boxed into a corner. The NUT's 1,000-odd members in Doncaster will follow the contract action, he says, and cover is bound to fail somewhere, when supply arrangements falter and health and safety implications of unsupervised children arise. </p> <p>Parents meanwhile are starting to consider the prospect of how they would cope if children came back home for an extra day or at odd hours. </p> <p>\"It's not inconceivable that you'd have children off school on different days,\" says Anne Armstrong. She supports the action but, with two young children at school in Hackney and a teacher husband still on a five-day week, is weighing up the short-term inconveniences. \"I'd have to take on the childcare myself. I could hire extra help, but most people can't.\" </p> <p>Kate Green of the National Council for One Parent Families is especially concerned. \"Lone parents are very vulnerable,\" she says. \"Employers are not necessarily sympathetic and lone parents in particular cannot afford to lose income. We are worried about how they would cope.\" </p> <p>Karen Hinds and Lynne Shephard, dropping off their children Niall and Nicole at Castle Hills, confirm that, although the four-day week is not an immediate threat to them, worries are starting to spread. </p> <p>\"It's bad for the kids but it'd be an added worry for anyone who'd got to think about making arrangements to have someone to collect at odd times or be there for them at home,\" says Hinds. </p> <p>The unions remain convinced that parents will understand their reasons for the action. They certainly need the support of those most affected - and that, in reality, means parents, as few children will be complaining about an extra day away from their desks. Certainly those dropping sons and daughters off at the school gates appreciate that something has to be done to force a resolution to the current crisis. But a general sympathy for the teachers doesn't necessarily translate into an enthusiasm for regular days away from the classroom.

      "bodyText": "Jade Jobes crumpled her mitten in a goodbye wave to her mum, Dawn, at a Doncaster school gate yesterday, in a gesture which up to half-a-million school students may soon be making only four days a week. Back at home in the suburb of Scawthorpe, a former mining community where the word \"strike\" has many resonances, the eight-year-old's bedtime reading now includes the Doncaster Star, with its bulletins on the local teachers' vote in favour of working to contract. Last week, members of the two largest school teaching unions, the National Union of Teachers and National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, voted overwhelmingly - 93% in favour - to stop covering unfilled vacancies and staff absences of more than three days. The action starts a week tomorrow in Doncaster and the 32 LEAs of Greater London. Ballots in Manchester, Nottingham, Kent, Portsmouth, Southampton, Leicester, Middlesbrough and Reading close next week, with the results expected to go the same way. And at the end of last week, the NUT announced plans to ballot its members in Hertfordshire, Sandwell, Hartlepool, Ipswich, Liverpool, Barnsley, the Medway Towns and Rochdale. The disruption, when it comes, will be the first to hit classrooms in England since the mid-1980s, when teachers took action over extra workload triggered by Sats.

They also deal in commodities, futures and options. </p> <p><strong> Um, right.</strong> We study financial and performance data of securities and incorporate this with knowledge gained from companies' annual reports, government statistics, regulations and legislation, and then make forecasts and representations to clients. </p> <p><strong> I think my wife's calling me now.</strong> You wanted to know. We work in two fields, as a stockbroker's investment analyst or as institutional investment analysts. </p> <p><strong> That's fascinating. Anyway . . .</strong> A stockbrokers' investment analyst tends to specialise in a particular field, say utilities. and regularly meets with their organisation's clients to advise them on how to raise money through shares issues or investing in portfolios. </p> <p><strong> Gripping. But my wife . . .</strong> In large firms an analyst will probably work in a team producing regular reports. In small companies they may be in charge of their own client and be expected to complete reports individually. </p> <p><strong> Nice talking to . . .</strong> Institutional investment analysts work closely with fund managers and decide what to buy and sell and make presentations to representatives of the funds they manage. </p> <p><strong> Er, that it?</strong> I expect you want to know how to become a trainee investment analyst. </p> <p><strong> Oh, is that the toilet?</strong> Well, you'll need a degree or professional qualification, and many applicants have both. The most useful are in economics, statistics or accounting. </p> <p><strong> I think I heard the doorbell.</strong> The Institute of Investment Management Certificate (IMC) is the mandatory test of competence in this field. Candidates must have six months experience in the financial services industry before they attempt the exam. After the IMC you may take a further two-part exam to become an Associate member. Competition for vacancies is fierce and tend to be concentrated in the south-east of England, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Edinburgh. </p> <p><strong> I'm feeling a bit faint.</strong> That will never do. Investment analysts need to be outgoing and be able to sell their skills and knowledge to clients, and have a capacity to work well in a team environment. Clients often demand information at short notice, so an ability to work under pressure and be able to cope with high levels of stress is paramount. Numerical fluency and an understanding of statistical and financial data are important. And it goes without saying that computer, communication and written skills are needed. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>The London Stock Exchange</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.londonstockex.co.uk\">www.londonstockex.co.uk</a> </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>The London Investment Bank Association</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.liba.org.uk\">www.liba.org.uk</a> </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>Society of Investment Professionals</strong><br> formally The Institute of Investment Management and Research, 21 Ironmonger Lane, London, EC2V 8EY.<br> Telephone 020 7796 3000 <br><a href=\"http://www.iimr.org.uk\">www.iimr.org.uk</a></p>",

A stockbrokers' investment analyst tends to specialise in a particular field, say utilities. and regularly meets with their organisation's clients to advise them on how to raise money through shares issues or investing in portfolios. Gripping. But my wife . . . In large firms an analyst will probably work in a team producing regular reports. In small companies they may be in charge of their own client and be expected to complete reports individually. Nice talking to . . . Institutional investment analysts work closely with fund managers and decide what to buy and sell and make presentations to representatives of the funds they manage. Er, that it? I expect you want to know how to become a trainee investment analyst. Oh, is that the toilet? Well, you'll need a degree or professional qualification, and many applicants have both. The most useful are in economics, statistics or accounting. I think I heard the doorbell. The Institute of Investment Management Certificate (IMC) is the mandatory test of competence in this field. Candidates must have six months experience in the financial services industry before they attempt the exam. After the IMC you may take a further two-part exam to become an Associate member. Competition for vacancies is fierce and tend to be concentrated in the south-east of England, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Edinburgh. I'm feeling a bit faint. That will never do. Investment analysts need to be outgoing and be able to sell their skills and knowledge to clients, and have a capacity to work well in a team environment. Clients often demand information at short notice, so an ability to work under pressure and be able to cope with high levels of stress is paramount. Numerical fluency and an understanding of statistical and financial data are important. And it goes without saying that computer, communication and written skills are needed. \u0095 The London Stock Exchange www.londonstockex.co.uk \u0095 The London Investment Bank Association www.liba.org.uk \u0095 Society of Investment Professionals formally The Institute of Investment Management and Research, 21 Ironmonger Lane, London, EC2V 8EY.

Ever since introducing e-learning three years ago, Derby College Wilmorton has certainly been able to reach the parts other colleges haven't. It has gained hundreds of extra distance learning students who are part of its wider community. Derby College is a Ufi \"hub\" and runs online courses as part of the government's learndirect initiative. And last year the college also ran two European-funded \"Adapt\" e-learning projects to provide online training to local small businesses.

So far only 20 out of 250 staff have signed up to train for e-learning, putting a brake on expansion of e-courses. Stewart sees problems in trying to move too fast too soon. \"Training your staff is one issue but colleges also have to look carefully at the quality of the materials.

E-learning is a cost-effective way of reaching a large number of students and getting them to a certain standard.

Even though none of the young Finn's previous races, in much smaller cars, had lasted more than half an hour, the experience of a full-length grand prix in a 750-horsepower machine, pulling goodness knows how much G-force in the corners, had not left him exhausted, either physically or mentally. In fact he felt like he could have got straight back into his Sauber and done it all again. </p> <p>\"It felt much shorter,\" he said, giving the barest hint of his new perspective on life, \"than it does if you're looking from outside.\" </p> <p>This may have been the most impressive grand prix debut since Jacques Villeneuve arrived from the United States and finished second on the same track five years ago. And yet Raikkonen is effectively on probation, his FIA \"superlicence\" - the document permitting him to compete in formula one - issued on the understanding that it will be reviewed after the fourth race of the season. </p> <p>As with the case of Jenson Button a year ago, there has been no shortage of greybeards keen to express reservations about letting such an inexperienced young man loose on the grand prix grid, including Max Mosley, the president of the FIA and a member of the superlicence committee, who cast his vote against letting Raikkonen race. </p> <p>The sceptics were wrong. Raikkonen qualified 13th for Sunday's race - the same grid position, someone recollected, as his compatriot Mika Hakkinen, the double world champion, in his first grand prix 10 years to the month earlier - and after making a bit of a mess of the start, recovered to pick up places not just by benefiting from retirements but through finding a way past some of his better known rivals. \"It was nice to do some overtaking,\" he said. \"I got past Fisichella, Jenson, and Alesi.\" </p> <p>Perhaps passing the two underpowered Benettons did not count for much. \"There wasn't a fight,\" Button remembered. \"He was behind me, and then he was in front of me, and that was it.\" But the third scalp clearly pleased Raikkonen's team boss, Peter Sauber, with whom Jean Alesi spent two disappointing seasons before leaving to join Alain Prost's team. </p> <p>Sauber was clearly elated by the performance of both his young drivers, the 23-year-old German Nick Heidfeld finishing fourth. \"I'm very, very proud of them,\" he said. \"Nick has more experience than people think. But it was a risk to take Kimi. You know, we finished eighth in the championship last year, we needed to go forward, and to do that you have to get good drivers. I tried very hard to get Heinz-Harald Frentzen, but it was not possible. So I had to take a risk. And I'm really happy, because Kimi's race was beautiful.\" </p> <p>And not just his race, either. \"What's remarkable about him,\" his race engineer, Jacky Eeckelaert, said, \"is that with so little experience he can act at a grand prix weekend just like a normal racing driver. He's quite amazing. In those three days he didn't put a foot wrong - not one single spin, no gravel trap, not even a flat spot on a tyre. Nothing. He drove a perfect three days, like a driver who's been doing it for 10 years.\" </p> <p>Eeckelaert had told him to take the weekend steadily. \"We pushed him to be very careful, because people had been critical. For instance, Michael Schumacher rolled his car on Friday. Not his fault. Jacques Villeneuve and Ralf Schumacher had a big accident in the race, and a marshal was killed. I don't know whose fault that was. But if Kimi had been involved, and perhaps someone had been killed, can you imagine what would people have said?\" </p> <p>But if Eeckelaert was pleased by his sensible behaviour, he was delighted by his speed. \"He was fast and consistent. You can be slow and make no mistakes, but he's fast with no mistakes. So it means that his potential is even bigger than he's shown this weekend.\" </p> <p>Raikkonen is from Espoo, a small town a few miles outside Helsinki. His background is modest. His father, Matti, drives a machine that flattens gravel roads. His mother, Paula, works in the state pensions office. He has an older brother, Rami, who is a rally driver and is currently leading the national under-25 championship. </p> <p>When Kimi was three or four, his father gave the boys a pair of mini motorbikes to ride around the back yard. Sliding around in the rain and snow they made such a mess that it was thought prudent to move their hobby outside the home, and at the age of eight Kimi got his first home-built go-kart. </p> <p>Ten years of successful competition in national and international kart races led him to England and Formula Ford in 1999. Last year he graduated to Formula Renault, winning all four races in the winter series, seven out of the 10 rounds of the British championship, and two of the three races comprising the European series. Of his total of 23 races before Sunday, he had won 13. </p> <p>He has been managed since 1999 by Steve Robertson, a former Indycar driver who is the son of David Robertson, one of Jenson Button's co-managers. Raikkonen has been living with Robertson in Chigwell, Essex, but will soon move to Switzerland to be close to the Sauber factory. He is also an expert snowboarder and ice hockey player. </p> <p>Just as some have misjudged Raikkonen's maturity at the wheel, others will probably assume from his quiet manner that he has nothing to say. But after a few minutes of parrying post-race questions, trying not to give answers that might betray naivety, his reserve began to melt. A grin broke through when he was asked how he had felt about finishing on the same lap as the leader. </p> <p>\"That was really nice,\" he said. \"I was looking in my mirrors towards the end, but nobody was coming.\" </p> <p>Kimi Raikkonen is probably not destined to spend his life looking in his mirrors. Pretty soon, you would have to guess, everybody else will be looking out for him.</p>",

But what is most striking is that the term \"male nurse\" is still in use at all. True, there are very few men in nursing. But I can't recall someone being described as a female doctor, lawyer, engineer - or even \"female soldier\". It's a sign of how men in caring professions continue to be viewed as slightly weird. They are lucky if people simply assume they are gay; if unlucky, that they have darker motives for choosing a caring role. </p> <p>Men who choose a career caring for children are the ones who face the highest obstacles. At a nursery attended by my oldest son, the good news was that there was a male member of staff. The bad news was that many parents were put off by this. Many insisted that their children's nappies were not changed by him. Think that through just for a moment, and imagine how it made him feel. He has moved on to other things now. </p> <p>Just one in a hundred nursery nurses are male. Early schooling is also - increasingly - a female- dominated zone: just 3% of nursery teachers and 17% of primary school teachers are men, with the lower years even more skewed along gender lines. </p> <p>The only two men on an infant school course at a central London college say they have been openly accused of being gay (\"even by my mum's friends,\" says one), \"perverts\" and/or not up to a \"proper\" job. </p> <p>Does it matter? Isn't childcare women's work anyway? Yes and no. The gender gap in care matters hugely. It blocks men from a growing part of the labour market. And it almost certainly holds wages down in the caring professions. But the real price will be paid in years to come, because the apartheid of the childcare professions is based on outdated, self-fulfilling assumptions about gender roles. It risks condemning another generation to a life of gender inequality. We lament the fact that men do not do their fair share of unpaid work, then put our sons into institutions which, being female-staffed, ram home the message that caring is women's work. </p> <p>Why is an 18-year-old woman with no children seen, intrinsically, as a better carer than a man who has raised three? We have progressively and successfully abolished the myths that barred women from certain professions, including the military. Women are now on warships and in the cockpits of fighter planes. It is time to drop the similarly short-sighted prejudices about men's ability to care, to cuddle, to teach, to play. We've had GI Jane; it's time for Barbie Bill. </p> <p>What, then, is to be done? The national childcare commission, which produced its excellent report recently, records gender disparities but has little to offer in terms of remedies. A few symbolic gestures from the government would help (how about a Male Carer of the Year award?). The training bodies for caring professions need to adopt a more proactive approach to attracting men - or at the very least, to not repelling them. And individual institutions need to put in place strict non-discrimination policies. </p> <p>But it may be that, given the size of the mountain, more drastic action is required. We know that men are put off by the low salaries and that many are unable to take the time to undergo training courses, because they are more likely to be the primary breadwinner in their household. Perhaps we should offer men who want to train as childcarers an additional financial incentive. We offer science and maths teacher trainees \u00a31,000 bursaries. Why not male childcare trainees? Of course, it should not be necessary. But in the real world, right now, it might be the key to kick-starting the process of getting more men in the nursery, in the same way that women-only shortlists kick-started the process of getting more women into parliament. </p> <p>Above all, though, a broader shift in attitudes is required if men are to feel comfortable choosing a caring job. One of the infant school trainees, after recounting endless tales of stereotyping and innuendo, said: \"It is incredibly upsetting. You just try not to think about it and get on with the job. Because I think it is the most important job in the world.\"</p>",

And individual institutions need to put in place strict non-discrimination policies. But it may be that, given the size of the mountain, more drastic action is required. We know that men are put off by the low salaries and that many are unable to take the time to undergo training courses, because they are more likely to be the primary breadwinner in their household. Perhaps we should offer men who want to train as childcarers an additional financial incentive. We offer science and maths teacher trainees \u00a31,000 bursaries. Why not male childcare trainees? Of course, it should not be necessary. But in the real world, right now, it might be the key to kick-starting the process of getting more men in the nursery, in the same way that women-only shortlists kick-started the process of getting more women into parliament. Above all, though, a broader shift in attitudes is required if men are to feel comfortable choosing a caring job. One of the infant school trainees, after recounting endless tales of stereotyping and innuendo, said: \"It is incredibly upsetting. You just try not to think about it and get on with the job. Because I think it is the most important job in the world.\"",

Jackson's speech, which focuses on his children's charity Heal the Kids, will not be broadcast on TV news bulletins tonight. The BBC, ITN and Sky News cameras have been banned from the union's debating chamber. Like all popstars, Jackson is sensitive about his image. And to control exactly what footage is released, he has hired a TV company to film the proceedings. However, the film will remain his property with less than five minutes of \"hellos and goodbyes\" released to broadcasters. So the broadcasters will have to make do with filming the spectacle surrounding Jackson's unprecedented appearance. Jackson will be surrounded by his own security entourage, and police presence has been stepped up in the city. Fans sporting Michael Jackson T-shirts are already gathering to try and catch a glimpse. Around 40 journalists will have seats inside the chambers, while a similiar amount will watch the address from an ante-room via a live feed. Many more press photographers are expected outside the St Michael Street building. Oxford University Union has put its most stringent ever security measures in place for tonight's address. There will be 40 security guards inside the students' union building and 40 police outside. The security arrangements are even tighter than those deployed when Salman Rushdie addressed the union during the peak of the death threats against him. But the university guards will jostle for space with Jackson's own team of minders \"These are not the usual security arrangments. Michael Jackson is not a usual speaker,\" said Daniel Johnson, spokesman for the students' union. \"We are more interested in crowd control than security threats,\" he said. By 4pm 250 fans had gathered outside the union, but thousands more are expected to converge on the city centre to try to catch a glimpse of the world's most eccentric popstar. The union has been deluged with applications from students wanting tickets for the event with 3,000 applications. \"There will only be 500 people in the chamber tonight,\" said Mr Johnson. \"Jerry Springer and OJ Simpson are the only other celebrities who have generated as much demand for tickets.\" Related story Feb 22: Jacko bans TV from Oxford address",

Liverpool-based Liver housing association proposed to pay Elaine Price-Taylor what would have been by far the highest pay-off in the sector, as part of a \u00a31.7m package to three of the association's directors. The package was drawn up as part of plans for a merger with Grosvenor housing association, which has now been postponed. A statutory report into affair by solicitor Nicholas Bohm for the Housing Corporation, published this week, found that the payments would have been \"ultra vires and incompatible with Liver's charitable status and would injure the reputation of the housing association sector\". The report revealed that the association had been warned against the sums involved but still proceeded with the plan. It also criticised Ms Price-Taylor for failing to withdraw from discussions about her proposed pay off. The report concluded that the association's whole board were responsible for mismanagement, but said the responsibility of the association's chairman at the time, Bryon Clarke, who remains on the board, was larger than others. It added: \"The scale of the proposed payments was far beyond what would have been reasonable or appropriate.\" However the report clears Liver of misconduct. The association remains under supervision by the Housing Corporation which this week made three statutory appointments to Liver's board. This is the first report of its kind to be made public by the Housing Corporation. It comes amid growing concern about high pay and severance packages in the sector. A statement from Liver welcomed the fact that it had been cleared of misconduct and stressed that the payments had not been made. The corporation's chief executive Dr Norman Perry said: 'This inquiry has underlined the importance of good corporate governance.

Our thoughts are with all of those who will miss him so much.\" The two other victims named yesterday were Alan Ensor, 44, a civil engineering project manager of York, and Barry Needham, 40, a freight logistics coordinator, also of York. Mr Ensor leaves his wife Wendy and two sons, aged 11 and 13. Neighbours in the village of Dunnington said that he had been a devoted family man and that everyone who knew him was distraught. Friends and relatives of Mr Needham, who lived with his wife Marguritta, were too upset to comment. A Coventry man, Ian Farndon, 27, was remanded in custody yesterday, accused of wasting police time by falsely claiming that a relative of his had been on the wrecked train and was missing. He was also charged with possessing cannabis.",

They were also not informed about their rights so lacked the knowledge and confidence to get the support, training and opportunities needed to take on their \"adult\" responsibilities.</p> <p>Save the Children recommended that local authorities appoint a \"young people's worker\" or children's rights officer to complement the work of youth and social workers. It said professionals could benefit from further training to help them meet young people's emotional and practical needs. </p> <p>Paula Rodgers, policy and research manager of Save the Children in Northern Ireland said: \"We would like to see young people involved in social work training so staff can gain a better understanding of their needs and aspirations.\"</p> <p>Neil Hunt, director of child protection at the NSPCC, said advocacy schemes needed to be formalised, so at least children in care had access to a child right's officer. </p> <p>However, he added: \"We would prefer to see advocacy services available to all children in need, and have been developing standards for them in the Advocacy Consortium, along with the Children's Society, Barnardo's and NCH [formerly National Childrens' Homes].\" </p> <p>Mr Hunt said advocacy was important for young people, as they often found it difficult to express their needs when they were under stress. </p> <p>But he acknowledged that research suggested young people were most likely to seek support from their peers, rather than from an adult professional. </p> <p>Peter Kemp, children's rights and participation lead on ADSS children's and families committee, welcomed the idea of involving young people in social work training. </p> <p>Mr Kemp, who is also the director of Durham social services said: \"In Durham, we've asked children in care what they think about their social workers and compared this with social workers' self-assessments. This feeds back into staff training.\"</p> <p>But he was not convinced that child rights officers would help youngsters with a wide range of needs. \"They're more appropriate for helping children at risk.\"</p> <p>It would be more empowering to enable children to find their own solutions to their problems, argued Mr Kemp. \"We've set up an investing in children programme to ensure young people's needs are met. </p> <p>\"This has enabled them to do research on subjects that concern them before they put their views to service providers. For example, they were unhappy about the lack of subsidised public transport, which left many feeling isolated so we paid for them to gather information on schemes in Cumbria and the Netherlands.\"</p>",

The report, Challenging transitions: young people's views and experiences of growing up, for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, found that many young people felt social workers discriminated against them because of their age. Interviewees said this meant they had lacked adequate information and support for independent living, especially in relation to housing benefits, social services and education. They were also not informed about their rights so lacked the knowledge and confidence to get the support, training and opportunities needed to take on their \"adult\" responsibilities. Save the Children recommended that local authorities appoint a \"young people's worker\" or children's rights officer to complement the work of youth and social workers. It said professionals could benefit from further training to help them meet young people's emotional and practical needs. Paula Rodgers, policy and research manager of Save the Children in Northern Ireland said: \"We would like to see young people involved in social work training so staff can gain a better understanding of their needs and aspirations.\" Neil Hunt, director of child protection at the NSPCC, said advocacy schemes needed to be formalised, so at least children in care had access to a child right's officer. However, he added: \"We would prefer to see advocacy services available to all children in need, and have been developing standards for them in the Advocacy Consortium, along with the Children's Society, Barnardo's and NCH [formerly National Childrens' Homes].\" Mr Hunt said advocacy was important for young people, as they often found it difficult to express their needs when they were under stress. But he acknowledged that research suggested young people were most likely to seek support from their peers, rather than from an adult professional. Peter Kemp, children's rights and participation lead on ADSS children's and families committee, welcomed the idea of involving young people in social work training. Mr Kemp, who is also the director of Durham social services said: \"In Durham, we've asked children in care what they think about their social workers and compared this with social workers' self-assessments. This feeds back into staff training.\" But he was not convinced that child rights officers would help youngsters with a wide range of needs. \"They're more appropriate for helping children at risk.\" It would be more empowering to enable children to find their own solutions to their problems, argued Mr Kemp. \"We've set up an investing in children programme to ensure young people's needs are met. \"This has enabled them to do research on subjects that concern them before they put their views to service providers. For example, they were unhappy about the lack of subsidised public transport, which left many feeling isolated so we paid for them to gather information on schemes in Cumbria and the Netherlands.\"",

      "body": "<p>For some while during the late 80s it was common for conversations on the inadequacies of the England football team to centre on the lack of a defensively solid-yet-attack-minded winger. Traditionally this discussion was brought to a conclusion with mass exclamation of the words, \"We've never really replaced Steve Coppell\". </p> <p>I imagine that these days something similar must be heard coming from the lips of television outside-broadcast crews as they feverishly scan the crowd at England's matches. They are looking for a conspicuous, talented fan with the ability to conjure something a little bit special for the people at home during moments when the ball has gone out of play. Someone they can use to say \"England\" to the viewers in the same way US movie directors use a still of Big Ben and a snatch of The British Grenadiers. </p> <p>Sadly, as was obvious during last week's match at Villa Park, despite the face paint and the wacky headgear we just don't have the individuals any more. </p> <p>Because, when it comes to a ubiquitous and easily recognisable supporter of the national team, it has to be said that we've never really replaced the red-white-and-blue-wearing Ken Bailey. The diminutive, tail-coated Bailey was a fixture of England matches, a target-man for the cameras. Since his death nobody has been found to fill his top hat and other nations have overtaken us. </p> <p>Colombia, for example, have unexpectedly come from nowhere with their spectacular birdman. Clad from head to toe in yellow and blue feathers, this wunderkind of modern fandom has shot right to the top during the past decade. </p> <p>His greatest moment came during a match at USA 94 when his fellow countrymen lowered him from an upper tier on a wire so that he could flap in attention-grabbing style over the heads of the crowd. That at least is my interpretation of it. It's possible, of course, that they were actually attempting to lynch him for bringing shame on the motherland with his irritating aviform antics. </p> <p>The Dutch on the other hand have come up with a typical dashing solution to the problem facing TV directors and produced a whole roster of fans who are comfortable on camera. The trio who most encapsulate this style of total supporterhood are the Orange Pope, a spectacular if somewhat paradoxical figure in beard and mitre, and an elderly couple from the polder country who since the 1988 Holland v West Germany clash have been attending games in matching tangerine togas and wigs made entirely from carrots. </p> <p>If English fans are ever to match this sort of thing they have to watch and learn. Luckily, for the past three weeks they have had a chance to see how it should be done. At international and European level we have seen a master at work in therotund shape of the Spain and Valencia fan Manolo, whose drum-beating on behalf of club and country down the years has made him a favourite of TV directors the world over. </p> <p>It has to be said that Manolo's clumping rhythms are not to everyone's taste. The big man may wear a bebop-style beret but when it comes to drumming technique he is more max volume than Max Roach. His style is simple but brutally effective: he bangs that skin as hard as he can. And since he has forearms that look like a couple of Serrano hams, that is very hard indeed. </p> <p>When you are sitting 20 yards away from him, as I was in St Etienne in 1998, you can feel the beat thudding up through your feet, rumbling along your thighs and landing in your stomach with the kind of jolt that will stir evocative memories in anyone who has ever grabbed hold of an electric cattle fence to settle a dare. I don't know what Manolo does for the rest of the week but if my experience is anything to go on he could certainly make a tidy profit hiring himself out as an alternative remedy for anyone seeking relief from the discomfort of trapped wind. </p> <p>Hopefully, watching the big man in action will have inspired young fans of Manchester United and England to get out there and practise. Meanwhile the country awaits the new Ken Bailey. What we need is an elfin, bald and slightly lost-looking figure who will wave the union flag at every public opportunity. Yes, I know what you are thinking. But I reckon we should leave William Hague out of this. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

They are looking for a conspicuous, talented fan with the ability to conjure something a little bit special for the people at home during moments when the ball has gone out of play. Someone they can use to say \"England\" to the viewers in the same way US movie directors use a still of Big Ben and a snatch of The British Grenadiers. Sadly, as was obvious during last week's match at Villa Park, despite the face paint and the wacky headgear we just don't have the individuals any more. Because, when it comes to a ubiquitous and easily recognisable supporter of the national team, it has to be said that we've never really replaced the red-white-and-blue-wearing Ken Bailey. The diminutive, tail-coated Bailey was a fixture of England matches, a target-man for the cameras. Since his death nobody has been found to fill his top hat and other nations have overtaken us. Colombia, for example, have unexpectedly come from nowhere with their spectacular birdman. Clad from head to toe in yellow and blue feathers, this wunderkind of modern fandom has shot right to the top during the past decade. His greatest moment came during a match at USA 94 when his fellow countrymen lowered him from an upper tier on a wire so that he could flap in attention-grabbing style over the heads of the crowd. That at least is my interpretation of it. It's possible, of course, that they were actually attempting to lynch him for bringing shame on the motherland with his irritating aviform antics. The Dutch on the other hand have come up with a typical dashing solution to the problem facing TV directors and produced a whole roster of fans who are comfortable on camera. The trio who most encapsulate this style of total supporterhood are the Orange Pope, a spectacular if somewhat paradoxical figure in beard and mitre, and an elderly couple from the polder country who since the 1988 Holland v West Germany clash have been attending games in matching tangerine togas and wigs made entirely from carrots. If English fans are ever to match this sort of thing they have to watch and learn. Luckily, for the past three weeks they have had a chance to see how it should be done. At international and European level we have seen a master at work in therotund shape of the Spain and Valencia fan Manolo, whose drum-beating on behalf of club and country down the years has made him a favourite of TV directors the world over. It has to be said that Manolo's clumping rhythms are not to everyone's taste. The big man may wear a bebop-style beret but when it comes to drumming technique he is more max volume than Max Roach. His style is simple but brutally effective: he bangs that skin as hard as he can. And since he has forearms that look like a couple of Serrano hams, that is very hard indeed. When you are sitting 20 yards away from him, as I was in St Etienne in 1998, you can feel the beat thudding up through your feet, rumbling along your thighs and landing in your stomach with the kind of jolt that will stir evocative memories in anyone who has ever grabbed hold of an electric cattle fence to settle a dare. I don't know what Manolo does for the rest of the week but if my experience is anything to go on he could certainly make a tidy profit hiring himself out as an alternative remedy for anyone seeking relief from the discomfort of trapped wind. Hopefully, watching the big man in action will have inspired young fans of Manchester United and England to get out there and practise. Meanwhile the country awaits the new Ken Bailey. What we need is an elfin, bald and slightly lost-looking figure who will wave the union flag at every public opportunity. Yes, I know what you are thinking. But I reckon we should leave William Hague out of this. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "You could hear the professional engineer's amazement in Vic Coleman's voice - and see it in his face - as he presented his interim report on the Great Heck train disaster this morning in a York hotel. He cupped his hands and arched his eyebrows as he spoke of the \"energy creation\" and \"energy absorption\" in the world's highest closing-speed railway collision (the combined speed of the two trains was 140mph on impact) - and the way that 20-year-old steel rolling stock had survived it. Reassurance might seem an incongruous word in the context of 10 deaths and 70 injuries - 30 of them serious - on a humdrum journey across the countryside of northern England. But any traveller by train, even ones like myself who have spent hours at Great Heck within yards of the wreckage, must wonder at the skill and engineering expertise which saw these \"survival capsules\" - as Mr Coleman called them - survive a joint speed impact at 140mph. That wonderment doesn't extend, however, to the remains of the Driving Van Trailer (DVT), the relatively lightweight \"false engine\" at the front of the train, whose completely flattened remains were the most horrific image of the crash. Mr Coleman, the chief inspector of railways for the health and safety executive, has concluded provisionally that running the DVT at the front, with the much heavier locomotive pushing at the back, was not a factor. But any lay person looking at the interim report will want more than that. Rail unions have expressed concern about the practice, known as \"push-pull\". It sees GNER expresses (and other big trains) run north with the locomotive pulling from the front and south with it pushing from behind. The practice saves uncoupling and turning the trains, whose fixed procession of heavy carriages is a proven help to safety in derailments. But it may increase the risk of disaster when in \"pushing\" mode. At Great Heck, the DVT first had to swipe Gary Hart's Land Rover aside - something made harder, as Mr Coleman said, by the vehicle's trailer being stuck in a solid embankment and creating a wedge, which helped knock the express off the rails. The train survived this and carried on upright and inline, with only the front wheels on the ballast. But then it hit a small set of points which serve the sidings of a cement factory. The interim report suggests that these jerked the DVT - followed by the rest of the Newcastle-London flyer - just enough to the right to smash into the freight train coming the other way. Would the heavier locomotive have ridden the points and missed the 1,700-tonne procession of coal wagons? It is certainly something the HSE must exhaustively test. The unions will insist on it.

Got to watch Johnny Dutch. One moment he's flogging you a nice bit of Delft china, the next he's sailing men-o'-war up the Thames and taking potshots at London. Three cheers for the good old English, eh?

We live on a mixed-race island governed largely from a capital founded by Italians, who brought with them a system of government divided into two assemblies with a separate judiciary wrapped around with a central treasury and ministries run by secretaries of state and based on and around Thorney Island. All very familiar to William Hague, you'd have thought. All terribly foreign.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:&quot;jonathan.glancey@theguardian.com&quot;\">jonathan.glancey@theguardian.com</a></p>",

We've invested time and energy in Britain and what have these woad-wearers ever done for us?\" Centuries before the withdrawal of the legions, the poet Juvenal was having a go at the latest Roman fads. The fashionistas were flaunting around imperial markets carrying chunky \"ethnic\" handbags woven of reeds by the Brits. They called them \"bascauda\", which was British for basket. These insolent puellae were even polluting the Latin language with foreign words. Foreigners and their undermining ways, eh? Not to mention their suspicious sounding names. Caratacus. Cleopatra. But, how about William Hague? William sounds a bit Norman, and you couldn't trust the Normans with your Anglo-Saxon kingdom, could you? As for Hague, is that Dutch, or what? Got to watch Johnny Dutch. One moment he's flogging you a nice bit of Delft china, the next he's sailing men-o'-war up the Thames and taking potshots at London. Three cheers for the good old English, eh? Yes, but the English - 14-pints-a-day Vikings - arrived long after the British, who became the Welsh (and thus foreigners like the Scots and the Irish) when they weren't seeking asylum in France, which is very foreign. Isn't France where the Normans came from? They conquered England and their court in London spoke French before it spoke English, which was, of course, old German with a twist. Somewhere other confusing foreigners fit into this Dark Ages tapestry before the crown became Welsh (Tudors), Scottish (Stuarts), Dutch (William of Orange) and German (George I, and ever since). Now add into this regal weave the colourful common threads of later immigrants. Huguenots. Irish. Jews. More Italians. Poles, West Indians, Cypriots, Indians, Turks, Africans, Romanians, Chinese.. Britain's genius, and London's in particular, has been to absorb and ultimately nurture in its rough and ready way, foreigners of every creed, culture and colour. We live on a mixed-race island governed largely from a capital founded by Italians, who brought with them a system of government divided into two assemblies with a separate judiciary wrapped around with a central treasury and ministries run by secretaries of state and based on and around Thorney Island. All very familiar to William Hague, you'd have thought. All terribly foreign. jonathan.glancey@theguardian.com",

In a damning assessment of the City fund management, the report's author, Paul Myners, said that investment decisions were often skewed towards preventing underperformance in respect to their peers rather than obtaining the best returns for pensioners over the long term. For example, a fund which has dropped 10% is considered a top performer if other funds have fallen 11%. Mr Myners, chairman of the Gartmore fund management group and also chairman of the Guardian Media Group, said: \"The review finds that savers' money is too often being invested in ways that do not maximise their interests.\" Decisions about who looks after pension money is at the crux of the problem, said Mr Myners.

      "bodyText": "The Welsh assembly is seeking new powers to crack down on poorly performing social services departments in the wake of a high profile series of damning reports. The assembly has launched a draft consultation document setting out where and when ministers will intervene in the case of serious failings in social services. Underperforming, failing to protect vulnerable clients and unfairness would all be potential reasons for intervention, according to the document sent to unitary authorities for discussion. The document comes in the wake of the damning Waterhouse report on the abuse of children in care in north Wales and several critical joint reviews that have highlighted concerns about some social services departments in the principality. It sets out in detail the protocol whereby the assembly would intervene, but says intervention powers will only be used \"where there is clear evidence that an authority is failing either to discharge its functions adequately or failing to meet its statutory obligations\". Social services managers said they supported the move. Chairman of the Association of Directors of Social Services in Wales, Hugh Gardner, said: \"We welcome the protocol because we support good practice and we do not want to have to defend the indefensible.\" \"If an authority is failing then clearly it is a priority for the community and for the staff working in the service that it is brought up to speed as soon as possible.\" It is expected that most concerns will be resolved by the social services inspectorate in Wales. But it says that when serious problems do arise, intervention will hinge on how effectively the authority concerned responds to the criticisms. Action by the assembly would probably involve a minister meeting with the council leader to discuss the issues. An agreed action plan would then be drawn up and its implementation by the authority would be monitored. Serious concerns could involve problems in several areas including practice; staffing and management; policy; and external relations. The triggers for intervention are likely to involve serious failures to meet a range of statutory requirements, or a failure to follow guidance without justification. Examples of what could invoke intervention include: \u0095 A failure to protect vulnerable people from actual or potential harm; \u0095 Significant unfairness in dealing with individuals who are entitled to service; \u0095 Persistent underperformance on key indicators.",

      "byline": "Simon Jeffery",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>What is double jeopardy?</b> <br>Double jeopardy is an ancient English law that states no one who has been convicted or acquitted of an offence can be tried a second time on the same facts. <p><b>Why is it in the news?</b><br>The Law Commission, the official law reform body for England and Wales, has recommended that the law be changed with regard to murder. It says that a fresh trial should be possible if \"compelling\" new evidence emerges after the defendant is found not guilty. It is likely to become law if the government is re-elected.</p> <p><b>Does that mean the suspected Stephen Lawrence killers could be retried?</b><br>Yes - the law commission has recommended that the change should be retrospective, which would allow a fresh trial if compelling new evidence emerged. Neil Acourt, Luke Knight and Gary Dobson were acquitted of the murder in 1996 when a judge ruled that identification evidence was unreliable.</p> <p><b>Who else could it affect?</b><br>The Home Office has calculated there are currently 35 murder cases where defendants who were acquitted could be reinvestigated and new charges brought if the law is changed retrospectively.</p> <p>One of these is Billy Dunlop, who murdered pizza delivery girl Julie Hogg. He was acquitted of the crime in 1991 but confessed to the killing in a perjury trial last year and jailed for six years. Another would be former East End gangster Freddie Foreman, who admitted on television to committing two murders for the Kray twins that a court acquitted him for in the 1960s.</p> <p><b>Who supports a change in the law?</b><br>The law commission, the government and victim's relatives such as Ann Ming, Julie Hogg's mother, and Doreen Lawrence, Stephen's mother. Mrs Lawrence said today that she wanted her son's alleged killers to stand trial again. \"The jury in the case never had a chance to hear any of the evidence and they were acquitted by the judge,\" she said. </p> <p><b>What are the problems</b><br>Michael Napier, president of the Law Society which represents 80,000 solicitors in England and Wales, said they were not fundamentally opposed to a change in the law but questioned how a fair trial could be guaranteed.</p> <p><b>So who outright opposes it?</b><br>Civil liberties groups and lawyers such as defence barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC and Imran Khan, who brought a private prosecution against Neil Acourt, Gary Dobson and Luke Knight on behalf of the Lawrence family. Mr Khan said today that scrapping double jeopardy in murder cases would end the principal of innocent until proven guilty. </p> <p>\"Imagine a jury sitting in the trial who know a High Court judge has looked at the evidence and said it is compelling and should lead to a conviction,\" he told the BBC.</p> <p><b>Any other objections?</b> Ending double jeopardy could tempt sloppy investigations from the police since they would know that should things go wrong they could always attempt the prosecution again. The police may also continue to investigate a former suspect who had been acquitted of murder to justify their original decision to prosecute. </p> <p><b>Will double jeopardy be scrapped for all crimes?</b><br> Mr Robertson, though he does not support a change in the law, says it is irrational to scrap double jeopardy for murder but not other violent crimes such as armed robbery.

      "bodyText": "What is double jeopardy? Double jeopardy is an ancient English law that states no one who has been convicted or acquitted of an offence can be tried a second time on the same facts. Why is it in the news? The Law Commission, the official law reform body for England and Wales, has recommended that the law be changed with regard to murder. It says that a fresh trial should be possible if \"compelling\" new evidence emerges after the defendant is found not guilty. It is likely to become law if the government is re-elected. Does that mean the suspected Stephen Lawrence killers could be retried? Yes - the law commission has recommended that the change should be retrospective, which would allow a fresh trial if compelling new evidence emerged. Neil Acourt, Luke Knight and Gary Dobson were acquitted of the murder in 1996 when a judge ruled that identification evidence was unreliable. Who else could it affect? The Home Office has calculated there are currently 35 murder cases where defendants who were acquitted could be reinvestigated and new charges brought if the law is changed retrospectively. One of these is Billy Dunlop, who murdered pizza delivery girl Julie Hogg. He was acquitted of the crime in 1991 but confessed to the killing in a perjury trial last year and jailed for six years. Another would be former East End gangster Freddie Foreman, who admitted on television to committing two murders for the Kray twins that a court acquitted him for in the 1960s. Who supports a change in the law? The law commission, the government and victim's relatives such as Ann Ming, Julie Hogg's mother, and Doreen Lawrence, Stephen's mother. Mrs Lawrence said today that she wanted her son's alleged killers to stand trial again. \"The jury in the case never had a chance to hear any of the evidence and they were acquitted by the judge,\" she said. What are the problems Michael Napier, president of the Law Society which represents 80,000 solicitors in England and Wales, said they were not fundamentally opposed to a change in the law but questioned how a fair trial could be guaranteed. So who outright opposes it? Civil liberties groups and lawyers such as defence barrister Geoffrey Robertson QC and Imran Khan, who brought a private prosecution against Neil Acourt, Gary Dobson and Luke Knight on behalf of the Lawrence family. Mr Khan said today that scrapping double jeopardy in murder cases would end the principal of innocent until proven guilty. \"Imagine a jury sitting in the trial who know a High Court judge has looked at the evidence and said it is compelling and should lead to a conviction,\" he told the BBC. Any other objections? Ending double jeopardy could tempt sloppy investigations from the police since they would know that should things go wrong they could always attempt the prosecution again. The police may also continue to investigate a former suspect who had been acquitted of murder to justify their original decision to prosecute. Will double jeopardy be scrapped for all crimes? Mr Robertson, though he does not support a change in the law, says it is irrational to scrap double jeopardy for murder but not other violent crimes such as armed robbery. However, the law commission is unlikely to agree. Instead it says that double jeopardy is of \"fundamental importance\" and should be put on a statutory basis for all other offences. What happens in other countries? In Scotland, the high court is able to order a new trial on appeal for the same crime after a conviction has been quashed. Double jeopardy exists in the United States although in rare instances a person may be tried for a different crime based on some of the same facts used in a trial that resulted in acquittal.

      "body": "<p>Age Concern England is launching a new training and development programme this month to grow its own senior managers as part of a wider reform of management development in recent years. </p> <p>The \"moving into management\" programme will take 12 home-grown staff, who have recently taken on supervisory responsibilities but are not yet managers, and train them in a variety of management skills over the coming six months. </p> <p>\"Age Concern has grown a lot in recent years and we've realised we need to invest more in growing our own managers,\" says learning and development manager Colleen Nicholson. </p> <p>The charity has some 450 staff, of which about 10% are managers, but became increasingly aware of gaps in management skills following research carried out with a consultant three years ago.

      "bodyText": "Age Concern England is launching a new training and development programme this month to grow its own senior managers as part of a wider reform of management development in recent years. The \"moving into management\" programme will take 12 home-grown staff, who have recently taken on supervisory responsibilities but are not yet managers, and train them in a variety of management skills over the coming six months. \"Age Concern has grown a lot in recent years and we've realised we need to invest more in growing our own managers,\" says learning and development manager Colleen Nicholson. The charity has some 450 staff, of which about 10% are managers, but became increasingly aware of gaps in management skills following research carried out with a consultant three years ago. The study revealed significant skills shortages in working at a senior level of the strategic direction of the charity. Other areas the charity decided to focus on were change management skills and the development of quality standards within Age Concern. The skills gap research led to the introduction of a management development initiative. This involved the development of a series of in-house courses on topics such as finance, people management and influencing skills. \"We also developed coaching, especially for the top team and senior managers, because it's often difficult for them to get away from their jobs to do courses,\" says Ms Nicholson. One initiative involved trying to enlist staff from the finance department as coaches. This meant that if a manager was not following the proper financial procedures, instead of simply sending that manager a form to fill in someone from finance would coach the manager in understanding the procedures better. \"It's a good idea but has only been partially successful because we've had a lot of turnover in the finance department,\" says Ms Nicholson.

      "bodyText": "Livestock was beginning to move to British slaughterhouses today, even as more farms were declared unsafe as five new cases of foot and mouth disease were reported in England and Scotland. The discovery of new cases by officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has brought the total number of affected farms across the United Kingdom to 76. The most significant discoveries of the disease were at two farms bordering Dartmoor national park in Devon, where 50,000 cattle graze on common land. An outbreak was confirmed at Dunna Bridge Farm, Two Bridges on Saturday and fears were increased today with a second case confirmed at a nearby farm at Widecombe in the Moor. The potential for the disease to have spread to the cattle leading to an enforced mass slaughter operation was described as \"nightmare scenario\" by the south west regional National Farmers' Union director, Anthony Gibson. While the disease continued to take hold in some areas, the government said unaffected farms could begin to transport their animals to slaughterhouses under close supervision and under licenses. Farmers - whose livestock has plummeted in value over the last 11 days of enforced immobility - have been clamouring to apply for licenses. In Aberdeenshire alone, 71 licenses have been applied for. The British Horseracing Board and Jockey Club today announced that racing in unaffected areas would resume tomorrow - the first time since a ban was introduced last week. However, music magazine NME warned that some outdoor summer festivals might be cancelled due to the disease. There are hopes that the crisis may soon be under control as all but one of the confirmed outbreaks in Britain were conclusively linked to diseased animals elsewhere. Five new cases yesterday - at farms in Bishop Auckland, County Durham; Hatherleigh, Devon; Highampton, Devon; St Weonards, Herefordshire; and near Beattock, Dumfries and Galloway - were also believed to linked to previous cases. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, said measures were already in place to start moving unaffected cattle, sheep and pigs to abattoirs, while slaughtering was already under way in parts of Scotland. Hundreds of special licences have been given to farmers in such areas and one supermarket promised shoppers fresh supplies of British pork as early as today. The chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, said 14,092 animals had been slaughtered so far while another 60,000 would also be culled. In France, all movement of sheep, pigs, goats and horses has been stopped for two weeks, although officials at the EU maintain the crisis has not yet reached epidemic proportions. Meanwhile, banned spinal cord has been found at an abattoir in Blackpool in a consignment of imported beef from Holland. Spinal cord is included in the list of specified risk material (SRM) which is thought to be at greatest risk of carrying BSE infectivity. Under EU rules, it must be removed when the animal is slaughtered. Europe's veterinary experts will today consider authorising the use of vaccine to counter the spread of foot and mouth disease.

Natmags deputy managing director Duncan Edwards has made it clear in the past that he is interested in acquiring more companies. The Attic magazines would make a good fit with the Emap and IPC portfolios, but both companies have significant debts which hinder them making a bid.

      "body": "<p>A few years ago it was common for charities to hire retired generals or civil servants as chief executives, and look to the private sector for many senior managers.</p> <p>But there is growing pressure on voluntary organisations to develop their own managers and future chief executives and not rely on bringing people in from outside.</p> <p>Research last year by the voluntary sector national training organisation (NTO) found that management skills were the biggest challenge for the sector.</p> <p>NTO head Ben Kernighan says: \"In the past it was easier to recruit good managers from outside but now charities need to look carefully at their own training and development.\"</p> <p>Another reason for developing the potential of existing staff is the growing complexity and commercial activities of the sector. But that \"business\" approach still needs to be aligned with the traditional values of charities, which can make it difficult for a private sector manager to quickly adapt to working for a voluntary organisation.</p> <p>\"It can take a long time for managers from outside to come in and understand the culture of the sector so if charities can develop their own people they don't need to worry about that learning curve,\" says Mr Kernighan.</p> <p>That \"culture\" includes issues such as consensus-based management, the ability to manage volunteers and knowing how to deal with boards of trustees.</p> <p>Paul Streets, chief executive at Diabetes UK, says: \"Some people from the commercial sector think they can walk into a charity and start running it and some charities are seduced by that.</p> <p>\"But the sector needs to grow its own staff more. There are a lot more people in their 30s and 40s, who have worked in the voluntary sector all their lives and who want to be chief executives, and they need to be trained and developed.\"</p> <p>Stephen Bubb, head of the charity chief executives association Acevo, says he wants to encourage more development of potential future leaders within the sector.</p> <p>\"We are bringing in a new category of membership of Acevo for senior people in charities who are hoping to become chief executives.\"</p> <p>He praises the civil service system of identifying talented managers and developing them. The voluntary sector has never been very good at developing management potential, says Mr Bubb, but he hopes Acevo initiatives, such as a \"leadership academy\", will help to change things.</p> <p>One of the main barriers to management development in the sector has been lack of funds. Mr Bubb says: \"It's hard for a charity to fundraise for things like professional development of staff because people prefer to donate to charitable projects.\"</p> <p>Despite the lack of resources in many small and medium-sized charities, Mr Kernighan argues that even very small charities can have a training and development programme.</p> <p>\"It doesn't need to be anything ambitious but can be informal. For example, a small charity can approach a larger organisation in the same field to find mentors.\"</p> <p>Mr Kernighan is keen to stress that training and development does not necessarily mean \"shoving people on to two-day courses\". In fact, that can be counterproductive if the information learned is not effectively translated back into the organisation.</p> <p>He wants to see charities adopt a multi-faceted approach, which brings in mentoring, shadowing colleagues and bringing together staff from different departments to share experiences and work on common projects.</p> <p>Acevo's Mr Bubb agrees that mangers can learn a lot from simply talking to others in similar positions: \"We try and offer networking opportunities because senior people can always learn a lot from their peers.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A few years ago it was common for charities to hire retired generals or civil servants as chief executives, and look to the private sector for many senior managers. But there is growing pressure on voluntary organisations to develop their own managers and future chief executives and not rely on bringing people in from outside. Research last year by the voluntary sector national training organisation (NTO) found that management skills were the biggest challenge for the sector. NTO head Ben Kernighan says: \"In the past it was easier to recruit good managers from outside but now charities need to look carefully at their own training and development.\" Another reason for developing the potential of existing staff is the growing complexity and commercial activities of the sector. But that \"business\" approach still needs to be aligned with the traditional values of charities, which can make it difficult for a private sector manager to quickly adapt to working for a voluntary organisation. \"It can take a long time for managers from outside to come in and understand the culture of the sector so if charities can develop their own people they don't need to worry about that learning curve,\" says Mr Kernighan. That \"culture\" includes issues such as consensus-based management, the ability to manage volunteers and knowing how to deal with boards of trustees. Paul Streets, chief executive at Diabetes UK, says: \"Some people from the commercial sector think they can walk into a charity and start running it and some charities are seduced by that. \"But the sector needs to grow its own staff more. There are a lot more people in their 30s and 40s, who have worked in the voluntary sector all their lives and who want to be chief executives, and they need to be trained and developed.\" Stephen Bubb, head of the charity chief executives association Acevo, says he wants to encourage more development of potential future leaders within the sector. \"We are bringing in a new category of membership of Acevo for senior people in charities who are hoping to become chief executives.\" He praises the civil service system of identifying talented managers and developing them. The voluntary sector has never been very good at developing management potential, says Mr Bubb, but he hopes Acevo initiatives, such as a \"leadership academy\", will help to change things. One of the main barriers to management development in the sector has been lack of funds. Mr Bubb says: \"It's hard for a charity to fundraise for things like professional development of staff because people prefer to donate to charitable projects.\" Despite the lack of resources in many small and medium-sized charities, Mr Kernighan argues that even very small charities can have a training and development programme. \"It doesn't need to be anything ambitious but can be informal. For example, a small charity can approach a larger organisation in the same field to find mentors.\" Mr Kernighan is keen to stress that training and development does not necessarily mean \"shoving people on to two-day courses\". In fact, that can be counterproductive if the information learned is not effectively translated back into the organisation. He wants to see charities adopt a multi-faceted approach, which brings in mentoring, shadowing colleagues and bringing together staff from different departments to share experiences and work on common projects. Acevo's Mr Bubb agrees that mangers can learn a lot from simply talking to others in similar positions: \"We try and offer networking opportunities because senior people can always learn a lot from their peers.",

      "byline": "Danny Leigh",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the glossy US magazine Movieline, there was once a column called Guess Who Don't Sue, devoted to the drug habits and sexual peccadillos of film industry notables. The gimmick (and safety valve) of the slot was that the magazine never let slip the identity of that month's victim. Hints, of course, were dropped; but hints were all. Such, outside the scandal-mongering of the super- market tabloids, is Hollywood's way. </p> <p>There were, for example, unsubstantiated rumours in Los Angeles about a much-loved action superstar with a bad attitude towards women and a self-induced heart condition. That's all the public would ever know: vague whispers about a nameless celebrity. Until, that is, the latest issue of Movieline's rival monthly Premiere appeared, in which journalist John Connolly finally named a name: Arnold Schwarzenegger. </p> <p>The article began with the star's alleged harassment of TV presenter Anna Richardson during a trip to London to promote his recent film The Sixth Day. It got worse. Connolly detailed allegations of female colleagues groped, a male crew member bullied, a wife victim of infidelities, and a steroid-popping past as a bodybuilder bequeathing Schwarzenegger heart problems. </p> <p>The article has drawn a response of sorts from the star's publicist, Jill Eisenstadt. \"Arnold's not going to bother dignifying this,\" she said. \"We're moving on.\" Schwarzenegger's doctor, meanwhile, has informed Premiere that \"100% of what's written in the article\" is untrue. Some commentators suspect a political motive behind the attack, given the star's vocal Republicanism. </p> <p>All of which has left the movie business in shock - not least because Schwarzenegger is not known for sparing the lawyers. American newspaper the Globe, for instance, found itself embroiled in a $50m defamation suit in 1998 after describing him as a \"timebomb\" following heart surgery. It later printed a retraction. Dr Willi Heepe, the Berlin cardiologist unwise enough to raise the subject again on German radio, was ordered to pay Schwarzenegger $10,000 in damages. </p> <p>Then there's Premiere itself, which received a cautionary letter from Schwarzenegger's attorney Martin Singer the moment his camp got wind of Connolly's investigations. But, despite a pre-emptive campaign to discredit it (featuring outraged letters to Premiere from, among others, director James Cameron), the magazine stuck with its story. And guess who didn't sue? </p> <p>Apart from the lack of a lawsuit, however, there is another remarkable aspect to the story: that, amid the bloodless hype of movie journalism, it was even commissioned in the first place. After all, within the film press breaking ranks like this simply isn't done - and not just out of deference to publicists and lawyers. Rather, the flaws and foibles of movie stars stay out of the papers because their fame provides a livelihood for the studio system's ranks of worker bees, journalists included. </p> <p>And that, quite apart from the grotesque nature of some of the allegations, is perhaps the story's most damaging implication for its subject. Increasingly unsuccessful at the box office, Schwarzenegger has apparently been deemed disposable by his own community. </p> <p>It is a neat coincidence, therefore, that British audiences will this month be able to revisit the former Mr Universe in his cinematic pomp, with a reissue of his 1984 movie The Terminator.

      "bodyText": "In the glossy US magazine Movieline, there was once a column called Guess Who Don't Sue, devoted to the drug habits and sexual peccadillos of film industry notables. The gimmick (and safety valve) of the slot was that the magazine never let slip the identity of that month's victim. Hints, of course, were dropped; but hints were all. Such, outside the scandal-mongering of the super- market tabloids, is Hollywood's way. There were, for example, unsubstantiated rumours in Los Angeles about a much-loved action superstar with a bad attitude towards women and a self-induced heart condition. That's all the public would ever know: vague whispers about a nameless celebrity. Until, that is, the latest issue of Movieline's rival monthly Premiere appeared, in which journalist John Connolly finally named a name: Arnold Schwarzenegger. The article began with the star's alleged harassment of TV presenter Anna Richardson during a trip to London to promote his recent film The Sixth Day. It got worse. Connolly detailed allegations of female colleagues groped, a male crew member bullied, a wife victim of infidelities, and a steroid-popping past as a bodybuilder bequeathing Schwarzenegger heart problems. The article has drawn a response of sorts from the star's publicist, Jill Eisenstadt. \"Arnold's not going to bother dignifying this,\" she said. \"We're moving on.\" Schwarzenegger's doctor, meanwhile, has informed Premiere that \"100% of what's written in the article\" is untrue. Some commentators suspect a political motive behind the attack, given the star's vocal Republicanism. All of which has left the movie business in shock - not least because Schwarzenegger is not known for sparing the lawyers. American newspaper the Globe, for instance, found itself embroiled in a $50m defamation suit in 1998 after describing him as a \"timebomb\" following heart surgery. It later printed a retraction. Dr Willi Heepe, the Berlin cardiologist unwise enough to raise the subject again on German radio, was ordered to pay Schwarzenegger $10,000 in damages. Then there's Premiere itself, which received a cautionary letter from Schwarzenegger's attorney Martin Singer the moment his camp got wind of Connolly's investigations. But, despite a pre-emptive campaign to discredit it (featuring outraged letters to Premiere from, among others, director James Cameron), the magazine stuck with its story. And guess who didn't sue? Apart from the lack of a lawsuit, however, there is another remarkable aspect to the story: that, amid the bloodless hype of movie journalism, it was even commissioned in the first place. After all, within the film press breaking ranks like this simply isn't done - and not just out of deference to publicists and lawyers. Rather, the flaws and foibles of movie stars stay out of the papers because their fame provides a livelihood for the studio system's ranks of worker bees, journalists included. And that, quite apart from the grotesque nature of some of the allegations, is perhaps the story's most damaging implication for its subject. Increasingly unsuccessful at the box office, Schwarzenegger has apparently been deemed disposable by his own community. It is a neat coincidence, therefore, that British audiences will this month be able to revisit the former Mr Universe in his cinematic pomp, with a reissue of his 1984 movie The Terminator. Back when the film was released, its leading man was fast becoming a pectoral-rippling emblem of his times: the champion bodybuilder from a remote Austrian mountain village who, like the equally cumbersome Swedish wrestler Tor Johnson in the 1940s, had come to the US with high hopes of movie stardom.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 George Clooney will appear in the comedy Welcome to Collinwood, a Full Monty-type comedy in which he will play a safecracker involved in a pawn shop robbery. Clooney and Steven Soderbergh, who has directed him in Out of Sight and the forthcoming Ocean's Eleven, will produce Collinwood through their own company. \u0095 Yesterday's high school shootings in San Diego, California, may further postpone the release of the blighted Othello adaptation, O, directed by Tim Blake Nelson, and starring Josh Hartnett and Martin Sheen. The film, completed in summer 1999, transfers Shakespeare's original play to a college setting, and ends in bloody tragedy. Its release was first delayed by the Columbine shootings in 1999 and a year later, producers pulled the film when US presidential candidates targeted movie violence. Miramax and Dimension Films latest release date, April 27, now looks equally threatened. Says Dimension publicist Elizabeth Clark: \"We are not commenting on the release of the film, given the unfortunate incident that occurred [yesterday] in San Diego.

At 1.30pm ITV has averaged 1.4m and a 19% share so far in 2001; while in the early evening slot - where ratings flop Public Property has played for six weeks - the average is 1.9m and a 14% share. Crossroads was brought back to replace Home and Away, which was poached by Channel 5 last year. The final ITV episode of the Aussie soap last June had 2m at lunchtime and 4.3m for its teatime repeat. ITV director of programmes David Liddiment controversially pulled Home and Away early from the schedules to prevent Channel 5 inheriting ITV's audience for the show.

      "bodyText": "BBC and ITV news chiefs have decided not to follow up tentative plans to overhaul the rules on election coverage. The changes were mooted in response to the American TV networks' disastrous coverage of the US election. Calls for UK broadcasters to pool exit poll operations - or to abandon the use of exit polls altogether - were issued after last year's Newsworld conference in Barcelona. But the calls have been largely ignored in new producer guidelines issued by the BBC. After the conference, Peter Horrocks, head of BBC current affairs, and Steve Anderson, ITV controller of news and current affairs, agreed to discuss new strategies to minimise the risk of inaccurate poll results. Mr Horrocks told journalists a pooled operation would be the best strategy, while Mr Anderson opted for abandoning exit polls altogether. But new BBC guidelines do not require any change to the way BBC journalists and producers use opinion polls. \"The feeling is producer guidelines are sufficiently well-designed not to need changing,\" said a BBC spokesman. The guidelines advise journalists to be careful when using polls, pointing out that they \"can be wrong\". They suggest journalists avoid using language that gives polls \"greater credibility than they deserve\". But the guidelines have not been overhauled since the last general election. They do, however, offer producers new advice on devolution and the use of the internet in elections. Network programmes are asked to give \"a fair proportion\" of items to stories affecting the Scottish Nationalist party and Plaid Cymru, if they have \"distinctive\" policies.",

      "bodyText": "Ethnic Albanian gunmen who clashed with Macedonian soldiers for a second day running yesterday appear to have withdrawn from a flashpoint border village in northern Macedonia. US peacekeepers monitoring the clashes said the gunmen were seen leaving the village of Tanusevci, dumping their uniforms and weapons as they left, after exchanging fire with Macedonian troops. The gunmen headed towards the border with Kosovo but stopped short of the US peacekeeping troops there who have reinforced their positions and say they will detain anyone who tries to cross. Jim Marshal, spokesman for the US-led contingent of peacekeepers based in Kosovo, a division of K-For, said there had been between 70 and 150 gunmen in the village, but he could not say how many remained. He said the rebels had been armed with machine guns and grenade launchers, and possibly had a weapons cache inside Kosovo. On Sunday, three Macedon ian soldiers were killed during fighting that flared in the mountain-top village. One was killed by a sniper, the others died when their vehicle hit a landmine. Macedonia insists it has limited the fighting to a handful of villages surrounding Tanusevci, 20 miles north of the capital, Skopje. Fears remain, however, that the fighting could spread to other parts of the country. As a precaution, the government has fully mobilised its reserve police forces and partially mobilised those serving as reserves in the army. A government police spokesman said that the rebel Albanian gunmen were operating throughout a wider area than just Tanusevci. \"Yes, there are some terrorists operating in the forests around Tanusevci,\" the spokesman said. \"We cannot rule out the possibility that other attacks may happen in that area.\" Macedonian army chiefs were in talks overnight with Nato on how to flush out the gunmen. Western officials had earlier urged Macedonia not to use force to end the crisis, but on Sunday they abruptly changed their tune, saying they would now understand if it did so. The Macedonian prime minister, Ljubco Georgievski, has been scornful of what officials from his country say is the failure of Nato-led peacekeepers in Kosovo to control the ethnic Albanian guerrillas. \"They are too scared that some of their soldiers might get killed,\" Mr Georgievski said recently. The Albanian militants near the border, the self-styled \"National Liberation Army\" (NLA), have yet to officially state their demands, or the reason for their rebellion. Ethnic Albanians in Macedonia, however, have demanded on several occasions since the former Yugoslav republic gained independence peacefully in 1991 that they be granted more rights. The NLA is also believed to have ties with ethnic Albanian rebels fighting against Yugoslav forces in the Presevo valley of southern Serbia, about seven miles to the north-east. Rising tension in both areas have raised the prospect of another major crisis in Kosovo less than two years after Nato and the UN moved in to police the province. Both rebel movements are thought to be receiving continual aid from Kosovo Albanians. In Skopje, the foreign minister, Srdjan Kerim, yesterday urged Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders to meet him for \"talks on how to overcome the crisis in a way acceptable to all\".",

      "bodyText": "Nato, the EU and Balkan states are engaged in an intense round of diplomatic activity to prevent fighting between ethnic Albanians and Macedonian troops developing into a serious crisis that could threaten the entire region. In Britain and other EU countries, diplomats said they had delivered tough warnings to Albanian leaders in Kosovo, as well as to Pristina itself, about the consequences of continuing attacks by ethnic Albanian insurgents in Macedonia and southern Serbia. The diplomatic moves came as Macedonian troops clashed with ethnic Albanian rebels for the second day running in mountains close to the Kosovo border. US peacekeepers sent in reinforcements to the border village of Debelde, and two US Apache helicopters and a spy plane tracked the fighting. The aims of the militant Albanian fighters in Macedonia remain unclear. The country's ethnic Albanian community makes up about a quarter of its 2m population. The Macedonian prime minister, Ljubco Georgievski, yesterday held talks with his Bulgarian, Greek and Albanian counterparts and then criticised Nato troops in Kosovo for their \"indolent treatment of the crisis\". Bulgaria said it saw no immediate need to send troops to help defend neighbouring Macedonia, despite a suggestion from Bulgaria's president, Petar Stoyanov, that such a move would be considered. \"Stoyanov declared moral and political support for the Macedonian government but this should not be interpreted as an official proposal for sending troops to Macedonia,\" the Bulgarian defence minister, Boiko Noev, said. In Moscow, President Vladimir Putin called Kosovo a hotbed of terrorists and said Nato-led peacekeepers were helpless to prevent ethnic Albanian extremists exploiting a power vacuum. Nato has sent a joint military and political mission to Skopje, the Macedonian capital, but Nato-led K-For peacekeeping troops in Kosovo have no mandate in Macedonia. However, after calls from the Macedonian president, Boris Trajkovski, to the Nato secretary-general, Lord Robertson, the organisation said it was stepping up patrols on the Kosovo side of the border. \"We want a political solution and not resort to military means,\" a Nato spokeswoman said. The Kremlin blamed the west for the worsening situation. \"We warned that this would happen,\" Mr Putin declared, following a telephone conversation with the Macedonian president. Mr Putin said Albanian extremists were flourishing in the Nato-patrolled buffer zone between Serbia and Kosovo because the Yugoslav army had been compelled to withdraw from the area. A Greek foreign ministry spokesman said yesterday that the spread of ethnic Albanian unrest to Macedonia stems from the \"selective implementation\" of UN-mandated pledges to disarm separatists. Macedonia has asked for an urgent meeting of the UN security council to approve a three-mile buffer zone inside Kosovo on the Macedonian border in which K-For would strictly control any movement of people and supplies. Nato, meanwhile, is engaged in talks with Belgrade over preventing Albanian insurgents entering the buffer zone between Kosovo and southern Serbia, where there is a significant Albanian population. The insurgents have been active in particular in the Presevo valley region, where the situation is further aggravated by arguments over who should protect the border. France has suggested that unarmed EU observers in the valley should be protected by EU rather than K-For troops - a move that could be interpreted as a first test for the proposed new EU rapid reaction force.",

      "bodyText": "The gay and human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell was savagely beaten by bodyguards protecting President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe as he tried to make a citizen's arrest yesterday of the African leader during an official visit to meet a senior European Union commissioner. As Mr Tatchell attempted his citizen's arrest he was repulsed forcefully and left lying semi-conscious in the gutter after receiving at least three blows to the head. In the lobby of the Hilton hotel in Brussels, Mr Tatchell managed to push past several of Mr Mugabe's burly minders and demanded that the African leader be arrested under the 1984 UN Convention against torture but was swiftly bundled into a corner. After the attack, a dazed Mr Tatchell, who attempted a similar citizen's arrest of Mr Mugabe in London in October 1999, claimed that one of the bodyguards had issued him with a death threat saying: \"We will find you and kill you.\" \"People who I believe were President Mugabe's agents attacked me and punched me around the face even though I was no physical threat to Mr Mugabe,\" said Mr Tatchell, his nose bloodied and his face bruised. \"The Belgian police allowed the Zimbabwean agents to have a free go and to beat me with impunity and yet President Mugabe is complicit in the use of torture which is a crime under international and Belgian law.\" Mr Tatchell suspects Mr Mugabe ordered the torture of two Zimbabwean journalists. Moments before the attack Mr Mugabe had finished off a lunch of smoked salmon and chicken with wild mushrooms in the company of the EU's development commissioner, Poul Nielson, who has been severely criticised by Zimbabwe's democratic opposition for agreeing to meet Mr Mugabe at all. For one bizarre moment Mr Mugabe and his large en tourage were trapped in the revolving door of the Hilton as they hastened to beat a retreat from Mr Tatchell's approach, allowing him to exit the hotel by a different door and attempt a second \"arrest\". But the campaigner was viciously beaten by a man who refused to identify himself but who later got into one of Mr Mugabe's limousines and left Mr Tatchell lying in the gutter almost under the wheels of one of the waiting BMWs. Mr Mugabe laughed and joked with one of his minders in the back of his limousine as Mr Tatchell was beaten. Mr Nielson later claimed he was unaware of the incident but said he was unrepentant about lunching with Mr Mugabe, who stands accused of orchestrating a campaign of violence and intimidation against the Zimbabwean media, judiciary and white farmers. \"I think it's a big mistake not to listen to what he has to say. It's not a government we are relating to, it's a nation,\" Mr Nielson argued, adding that Mr Mugabe had agreed to enter into a critical dialogue with the EU. He later told the European Parliament, however, that if Mr Mugabe did not act soon the EU would consider suspending its \u00a36m a year aid programme to Harare. Tory MEP Nirj Deva was one of several deputies to subject Mr Nielson to hostile questioning. \"He (Mugabe) has to be told there is a line in the sand across which he cannot walk. Would you have discussed matters with Stalin and Hitler?\" he asked the Dane. Morgan Tsvangirai, the main opposition leader in Zimbabwe, also condemned the meeting. \"I think it is a slap in the face for Zimbabweans,\" he told BBC Radio 4. \"To me and the majority of Zimbabweans that is endorsing and condoning his actions.\" Mr Mugabe later held talks with Belgium's prime minister, Guy Verhofstadt, discussing the nascent peace process in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a former Belgian colony, where Zimbabwean troops are stationed. Mr Mugabe is due in France today where he will meet President Jacques Chirac. Useful links OutRage! Zimbabwe Standard online Africa Online: Zimbabwe",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A deal believed to be the biggest in British literary history has seen Walt Disney secure lasting rights to AA Milne's classic character Winnie the Pooh. The cartoon makers have spent $350m (\u00a3239m) to buy the honey-guzzling bear. Since they first bought the rights to the character in the 1960s, Disney has been paying twice-yearly royalties for the privilege. The new lump sum replaces that obligation, buying Disney rights to Pooh until copyright expires on the bear in 2026.</p> <p>The profits from the sale will primarily benefit the Royal Literary Fund, which should receive about \u00a390m, while the Garrick Club and Westminster School will gain about \u00a360m each. The descendants of EH Shepard, the books' illustrator, will receive a smaller sum. </p> <p>However, the widow of Christopher Robin Milne, son of the author and hero of Pooh's original adventures, will not profit by the deal. Before his death five years ago, Lesley Milne and her husband sold half their share in the royalties to the Literary Fund for \u00a3150,000, using the other half to set up a trust fund for their daughter. \"Christopher was very anti-Disney,\" Lesley Milne told the <a href=\"http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/news/pages/sti/2001/03/04/stinwenws02059.html\">Sunday Times</a> this weekend. \"He hated what they had done with the books and the characters. Christopher just wasn't interested in money either.\" </p> <p>Sales of Pooh products, according to reports, have doubled over the past five years, outstripping the merchandising success even of Disney's home grown favourites, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. One Disney spokesperson says: \"The bear is even mightier than the mouse.\"</p> <p>\u0095 More about <a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/Lot/6840/\">Winnie the Pooh</a>.</p>",

Since they first bought the rights to the character in the 1960s, Disney has been paying twice-yearly royalties for the privilege. The new lump sum replaces that obligation, buying Disney rights to Pooh until copyright expires on the bear in 2026. The profits from the sale will primarily benefit the Royal Literary Fund, which should receive about \u00a390m, while the Garrick Club and Westminster School will gain about \u00a360m each. The descendants of EH Shepard, the books' illustrator, will receive a smaller sum. However, the widow of Christopher Robin Milne, son of the author and hero of Pooh's original adventures, will not profit by the deal. Before his death five years ago, Lesley Milne and her husband sold half their share in the royalties to the Literary Fund for \u00a3150,000, using the other half to set up a trust fund for their daughter. \"Christopher was very anti-Disney,\" Lesley Milne told the Sunday Times this weekend. \"He hated what they had done with the books and the characters. Christopher just wasn't interested in money either.\" Sales of Pooh products, according to reports, have doubled over the past five years, outstripping the merchandising success even of Disney's home grown favourites, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. One Disney spokesperson says: \"The bear is even mightier than the mouse.\" \u0095 More about Winnie the Pooh.",

You mess with an Elise, and people get upset in the way they do when telephone boxes change. </p> <p>But there's no major damage done. Some of the soft, rounded aspects of the old model have been swapped for some sharp creases. The old body didn't exactly seem apologetic, but the new one is brash and outgoing, quite muscular at the back and a bit angry-looking. It is also, apparently, 10mm closer to the ground than the old Elise, which might seem negligible. But, given that in the old model you were already virtually flat on your back on the tarmac, the extra 10mm represents a considerable feat of engineering. </p> <p>It also makes the car just that little bit more difficult to get into, which surely will go down as added value among the sports-car-owning hardcore. Unless a vehicle requires you to rupture at least one hamstring slotting yourself inside, it just isn't trying hard enough, and neither are you. Here, Lotus has come good: the new Elise is definitely a double- hamstring-twanger. And if the Elise is difficult to get into, it's nigh on impossible to get out of. Imagine trying to exit a deep sea diving outfit through the helmet. And with no hamstrings. Heaven knows how one would manage this while drunk. Even sober, the most sensible thing to do might be to take some tools and tunnel out at the back. </p> <p>Up to now, the Lotus Elise has been out on its own, but these days it doesn't quite have the road to itself and, unusually, it's the company's own fault. When Lotus helped out Vauxhall in the creation of the Vauxhall VX220 (the surprising, angular roadster that Griff Rhys-Jones advertises in his underpants), it's clear they did more than simply pass on a couple of tips. From within, through half-closed eyes and while stationary, the two models could be mistaken for one another. True, the Vauxhall has an exciting, you-too-can-race-at-Le-Mans push-button starter on the dashboard, whereas the Lotus is boring old key-operated. But otherwise, the most noticeable difference is that where the Vauxhall's dashboard is plastic-clad, the dashboard on the Elise I drove was wrapped in black suede, for that authentic, scratch-n-sniff, 1970s student effect. </p> <p>Inevitably, to elect to have an Elise in the British climate is to choose to be cold a lot of the time. Even with the roof on. But at least the fan keeps the windscreen clear. In the VX220, I spent a lot of time and energy swiping away at the glass with my forearm in a largely unsuccessful attempt to prevent it misting over completely every 10 seconds or so. The Elise has four slatted vents, like miniature Sydney Opera Houses, positioned neatly under the glass, with which you can wage effective war on the fug which predictably builds up when your nose is only three or so centimetres away from the windscreen and the temperature outside is close to freezing. </p> <p>The disappointing thing about the VX220 is how inoffensive the engine sounds. By contrast, the engine in the Elise (a 1.8 litre K-series, as in the previous model, but retuned) throbs like a powerboat at a standstill and very rapidly reaches offensiveness under acceleration - which must be at least half the point of owning a car like this. </p> <p>The two cars cost exactly the same, but one comes with a Lotus symbol on it and the other comes with a Vauxhall symbol - and, more than that, a Vauxhall nose, with its chrome V, as seen on Astras and Cavaliers. For some buyers, the choice will come down to which badge they prefer on their key-fob: the Lotus one, with its charismatic oily whiff of British motor sport history; or the Vauxhall one, with its charismatic oily whiff of sales rep.

      "body": "<p>Jodie Kidd is wearing a short platinum blonde wig, the fringe cut at a rakish angle. A make-up artist hovers with green eyeshadow and long, feathery false eyelashes. She looks a little overdone for noon. But then we are backstage at a fashion show and in half an hour Kidd will be stepping into a sequinned dress and high heels and taking her turn on the catwalk. She looks like something out of Bladerunner, she says. </p> <p>Oddly, neither the hairdresser nor his assistant have seen Bladerunner or, indeed, even heard of it, so this line of conversation isn't going anywhere, but she is right. </p> <p>Even without the wig and false eye lashes, Kidd has an almost sci-fi kind of beauty: with her preternaturally huge, almond-shaped, green-grey eyes; a wide, perfect mouth; and those extraordinary cheekbones. </p> <p>Kidd became famous for being thin, which is, she agrees, an odd thing to become famous for. She also became famous for being posh - very posh: polo-playing, hanging-out-with-royalty, country-house posh - but it was mainly the thin thing. She is still thin but no longer gaunt. In fact, her body is quite different to the days when her knobbly knees and sunken cheeks made the front pages. At 22, she has put on two stones to fill a size 10, occasionally a 12. She is beautiful now: lanky, yes, but peachy too. </p> <p>Meeting Kidd, it strikes you that the public furore over her weight was vicious. \"I was never remotely anorexic: it's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. My family are all skinny. I was 14 when I started modelling, and I was 6ft 1in. People hated me for it, and that was scary.\" </p> <p>She has often spoken of hearing the daytime television presenter Lorraine Kelly, whom she had never met, call her a \"sick, anorexic giraffe\" on air. It would be fairer to blame the designers, Kidd says. \"By the end, I wasn't enjoying modelling, but designers were still ringing me up and persuading me.\" </p> <p>Two years ago, she decided it was time to take a break. \"I was too thin, but I was also getting really sour, really jaded. I was earning all this money and getting flown first-class and I thought I was the bees' knees.\" During her time out from the fashion world, her figure developed. \"I didn't do it deliberately, I just grew up. I got boobs. My sister had always said to me that the second I hit 20 I would round out as she had. It's hard for me to put on weight but I was spending more time in the countryside, doing lots of riding, and I put on muscle.\" </p> <p>Kidd returned to the catwalk last year with a new mindset. \"I look much better now, and I know it. Before, I thought everyone hated me when they looked at me. I really enjoy the catwalk now. I've got that excitement back, the butterflies back.\" </p> <p>As a catwalk model, Kidd has metamorphosed from a loping, bony teenager to one of the best in the business: while many models wander, zombie-like, along the runway with the enthusiasm of schoolgirls trudging to the bus stop on a Monday morning, Kidd loves to vamp it up for the cameras. \"Of course it's just modelling, but I do think if you try a bit harder, give a bit more, it does show. There are girls who have beautiful faces but don't give.\" </p> <p>Kidd has not managed to steer clear of controversy over body image since her return - she was recently quoted as saying that her fellow model, Anna Kournikova, was fat. But then, it is probably almost impossible to be a catwalk model and have a \"normal\" body image. At her biggest - size 12, although she looked much thinner because of her height - Kidd found that clothes samples didn't always fit and was rejected from some Paris shows for being too big. At that point, she declared herself \"fat\", but said: \"I love being this size, I finally feel sexy.\" Her newfound womanly poise has led to an appointment as spokeswoman for the Rover British Fashion Awards. She is clearly anxious to confound the image of models as ditsy and rude. When caught unawares she can be rather offhand, in the way that beautiful 22-year-olds used to having people vying for their attention can be; but when she turns her full attention to a conversation she is exceedingly well-mannered. Perhaps she is right to say that the break from fashion deflated her ballooning ego. </p> <p>\"I'm the right age to model now, because I'm old enough to see that I'm incredibly lucky to have this opportunity. People shouldn't complain when they are being paid to wear incredible clothes and to travel. Modelling is very, very tough if you're slogging around and you don't quite make it, but if you get to a certain level it's fantastic.\" She spends as much time as possible at home in Wiltshire with her boyfriend, sleeping in her brother's spare room when she works in London. \"There is obviously a fake side to the industry and in London you get swept up in it. I need to get back to the countryside, cook a big shepherd's pie, muck my horses out, go for a walk.\" </p> <p>Kidd has her sights set on the country life: her goal is to make money to fund it. \"I can probably get my head down, work really hard for the next five or 10 years, and then be able to have a family and enjoy it. I want to have a nice house with lots of animals, and ride my horses.\" As well as modelling, she is planning a sideline in corporate entertainment, \"teaching people to play polo. You know, top model teaching you to ride sort of thing.\" </p> <p>Not that she needs the money. As a great- granddaughter of Lord Beaverbrook, Kidd's childhood was divided between English boarding schools and her parents' home in Barbados, where she learned to love horses through her wealthy showjumping father, Johnny Kidd. The patrician self-confidence which comes with her background is probably an asset in negotiating the world of fashion, and Kidd is close both to her parents and to her make-up artist sister and polo-playing brother. </p> <p>Her parents are watch proudly from the front row as Kidd returns to the catwalk for London Fashion Week. Backstage, her mother, Wendy, is perched quietly, trying not to get in the way. This is almost impossible with 40 rowdy people barging around a small room full of clothes rails and make-up kits, handbags and champagne glasses, and Wendy decides to head out for a walk before the show. Kidd asks her to bring back a chicken and sweetcorn sandwich. One sandwich and a swig of champagne later, she is up there in a red corselette worthy of a Las Vegas showgirl, and a white feather opera coat. Then it's home to feed the horses.</p>",

There are girls who have beautiful faces but don't give.\" Kidd has not managed to steer clear of controversy over body image since her return - she was recently quoted as saying that her fellow model, Anna Kournikova, was fat. But then, it is probably almost impossible to be a catwalk model and have a \"normal\" body image. At her biggest - size 12, although she looked much thinner because of her height - Kidd found that clothes samples didn't always fit and was rejected from some Paris shows for being too big. At that point, she declared herself \"fat\", but said: \"I love being this size, I finally feel sexy.\" Her newfound womanly poise has led to an appointment as spokeswoman for the Rover British Fashion Awards. She is clearly anxious to confound the image of models as ditsy and rude. When caught unawares she can be rather offhand, in the way that beautiful 22-year-olds used to having people vying for their attention can be; but when she turns her full attention to a conversation she is exceedingly well-mannered. Perhaps she is right to say that the break from fashion deflated her ballooning ego. \"I'm the right age to model now, because I'm old enough to see that I'm incredibly lucky to have this opportunity. People shouldn't complain when they are being paid to wear incredible clothes and to travel. Modelling is very, very tough if you're slogging around and you don't quite make it, but if you get to a certain level it's fantastic.\" She spends as much time as possible at home in Wiltshire with her boyfriend, sleeping in her brother's spare room when she works in London. \"There is obviously a fake side to the industry and in London you get swept up in it. I need to get back to the countryside, cook a big shepherd's pie, muck my horses out, go for a walk.\" Kidd has her sights set on the country life: her goal is to make money to fund it. \"I can probably get my head down, work really hard for the next five or 10 years, and then be able to have a family and enjoy it. I want to have a nice house with lots of animals, and ride my horses.\" As well as modelling, she is planning a sideline in corporate entertainment, \"teaching people to play polo. You know, top model teaching you to ride sort of thing.\" Not that she needs the money. As a great- granddaughter of Lord Beaverbrook, Kidd's childhood was divided between English boarding schools and her parents' home in Barbados, where she learned to love horses through her wealthy showjumping father, Johnny Kidd. The patrician self-confidence which comes with her background is probably an asset in negotiating the world of fashion, and Kidd is close both to her parents and to her make-up artist sister and polo-playing brother. Her parents are watch proudly from the front row as Kidd returns to the catwalk for London Fashion Week. Backstage, her mother, Wendy, is perched quietly, trying not to get in the way. This is almost impossible with 40 rowdy people barging around a small room full of clothes rails and make-up kits, handbags and champagne glasses, and Wendy decides to head out for a walk before the show. Kidd asks her to bring back a chicken and sweetcorn sandwich. One sandwich and a swig of champagne later, she is up there in a red corselette worthy of a Las Vegas showgirl, and a white feather opera coat. Then it's home to feed the horses.",

      "bodyText": "Channel 5 owner RTL and French rival Canal Plus are making a joint bid for domination of the European sports market. The powerful media groups are discussing the merger of their sports broadcasting rights and marketing units in a deal that would create a major player in the sports rights field. Sources close to the negotiations said it was inevitable that both companies would start serious talks, following months of speculation. \"The catalogue of sports rights between the two is really impressive. The potential synergies are very obvious and have been discussed before,\" said one source. RTL owns broadcast rights to more than 200 football teams through its Ufa Sports operation, and handles over 70% of the broadcasting franchise for the Uefa Champions League. Canal Plus owns the international rights to the French Rugby League, the UK Premier League and the French first division football league through its Sports Plus subsidiary. A Canal Plus spokesman denied that a successful merger would break a pact with the shareholders of sports channel Eurosport. The French company recently sold its stake in the station, and promised not to establish a rival service within 12 months. \"What we are talking about here is sports rights. Eurosport broadcasts sports rights, but this is about sharing the management of sports rights and nothing else,\" said the spokesman. The deal could also include French sports marketing firm JC Darmon, in which RTL holds a minority stake. Analysts gave the thumbs-up to the talks, saying that a successful merger would create a genuine power in European sports broadcasting rights. \"It is all about critical mass and bargaining power, so the bigger the better and you cannot get much bigger than this,\" said Christophe Cherblanc, analyst at SG Securities. Mr Cherblanc added that Canal Plus and RTL do not overlap geographically, and the deal would be a perfect combination of pay-TV and free-to-air services. A successful deal would put both companies second in the market for European sports broadcasting rights, behind Kirch Group of Germany. Kirch owns the rights to the next two World Cups and Formula One, following a controversial arrangement with national rival EM.TV.",

The wheeler-dealer at the centre of raging controversies over access to two of the world's premier sporting competitions, formula one and football's World Cup, is an odd paradox: a man who has devoted his life to controlling what other people can watch, yet who himself does not wish to be seen. </p> <p>Already embroiled in rows in Britain and Germany over his ownership of the television rights to the 2002 and 2006 World Cups, Kirch has now run into another storm over the 75% stake in formula one which he and his partners took last week. </p> <p>Though he has interests in free-to-air television, advertising and publishing, he is best known as Germany's pay-to-view TV czar.

That compares with \u00a34m for the British rights to the last World Cup. </p> <p>Yesterday the BBC's director of sport Peter Salmon accused Kirch of holding Britain to ransom over World Cup rights. </p> <p>\"Kirch has put aside the interests of the British public in its quest for a payment for UK rights in the order of 40 times what was previously paid for the 1998 World Cup,\" Salmon told MPs from the all-party BBC group at the House of Commons. \"BBC and ITV have made a very competitive bid. Kirch refuses even to discuss it with us.\" </p> <p>Defending the \"Crown Jewels\" policy, Salmon suggested that last year's Olympic Games, for example, would never have been given the blanket coverage they received in Britain had they not been protected. \"Commercial interests would snap up some events, like track and field, but who would bother with shooting and sailing?\" </p> <p>If the Kirch group's complaint is upheld, it will be free to accept the highest offer, even if that comes from a subscription channel such as Sky. If it is not upheld, there is the danger the company could withhold the rights from Britain altogether. </p> <p>Much the same pattern is being followed in Germany. Last month Kirch's talks with ARD and ZDF broke down and are being resumed only at the urging of the German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. </p> <p>Nothing about Kirch, from his obsessive secrecy to the way he built his fortune, suggests that concerns over his involvement in sport are misplaced. </p> <p>He is the head of one of Germany's two biggest television empires. Yet he does not even have an entry in the German version of Who's Who.

I was referred to the company's website which purports to carry a biography of the chairman. It is nothing of the sort, merely a brief history of Kirch's business exploits. </p> <p>I repeated my request. There was no reply for more than a week.

      "bodyText": "The BBC is searching for presenters to front its news bulletins for the new youth and entertainment network BBC3. But newspaper recruitment adverts fail to reveal one crucial quality for the job: good looks. Only reporters who can combine \"poise and style with journalistic credibility\" will be deemed acceptable. A BBC source put it more bluntly: \"Mingers need not apply.\" The policy takes a leaf out of ITV's book which for years have been filling the screens with good-looking women including Kirsty Young and Katie Derham. If the government gives the go-ahead for the corporation to change its BBC Choice digital channel into the youth and entertainment network BBC3, it will feature snappy one-minute news bulletins throughout the evenings. At least \u00a31m is being invested in developing the format. Recruitment advertisements, which began to appear this week, state applicants must be \"equally at ease reporting on Eritrea, Eminem and Everton\" for an \"original, inventive and challenging\" news programme. The service will \"reflect the channel's innovation and tone while maintaining the values and authority of BBC News\". There is a hint of what BBC bosses are looking for in another sentence: \"Those in front of camera will be able to combine poise and style with journalistic authority and credibility.\" In other words, applicants will have to pass a BBC beauty test. A source at BBC Choice said the channel head, Stuart Murphy, wanted two or three presenters to become the main faces of the channel's news output when it becomes BBC3. \"Stuart is keen they reflect the attitude of the rest of the channel and don't scare the horses,\" the source said. The BBC stressed the successful candidates would be \"journalists first and presenters second\". However, the revelation of Mr Murhpy's aim will fuel the concerns of BBC news veterans who feel they are being sidelined. A number of seasoned BBC journalists were upset at the end of last year, when they were told to concentrate only on radio.",

      "bodyText": "It could be a case for superspy James Bond. Monty Norman, the man credited with writing the James Bond theme tune, yesterday began a high court libel case against a newspaper for repeating claims that he was not the author of one of the best known pieces of film music. Oscar-winning composer John Barry claims he wrote the theme to the first Bond movie, Dr No, and not Norman. Yesterday Mr Justice Eady and a jury heard the twangy guitar score ringing out across the usually staid court number 13 at the high court in London. Opening the case for Norman, 72, James Price QC told the jury that the claim against the Sunday Times turned on whether the tune for the 1962 movie was written by Norman or, as the newspaper claims, by Barry. Mr Price said that the article damaged Norman's reputation not just by saying that he did not write the Bond theme but by suggesting that for 35 years he had been dishonestly taking the credit and the royalties for a piece he did not compose. Mr Price added that the article hurtfully suggested Norman was a \"nonentity\" and said he started his career as \"the singing barber of Hackney\". Apart from Dr No, Norman had written music for stage and film musicals, including Expresso Bongo, and had won Ivor Novello, Evening Standard and Laurence Olivier awards. The newspaper, said Mr Price, claimed that the famous Bond tune owed nothing to Mr Norman except for a snatch of a much-altered melody line. Barry, whose film scores include Born Free, Zulu and Midnight Cowboy, was in court. Opening the defence, Mark Warby, for Times Newspapers, said that the article was a classic example of a report and comment piece on a live dispute and was neutral and sensibly balanced, with the reader reaching no other conclusion than that Barry was claiming to have written the theme. Mr Warby said: \"The truth can hurt and Mr Norman has tried to falsify history to justify the claims he has made for recognition as composer of the theme.\" Mr Warby said that Barry was brought in to write the theme six months into the project because Norman had run out of inspiration. Barry was called in and offered \u00a3250 to sort out the problem. A deal was struck whereby Barry would write the theme for a flat fee and no royalties and Norman was to get the credit and the royalties. The hearing continues.",

An utter disgrace,\" claimed the affronted critic. \"They've completely ruined one of TV's legendary landmark programmes.\" The problem is, it's just too damn good to be Crossroads. And the Sun's Garry Bushell agreed. \"The set didn't even wobble once\" shrieked the page six headline. Both critics were taken with the speed it took the writers of the new-look Crossroads to introduce some sex as the lantern-jawed deputy manager Jake Booth (Colin Wells) absconded into a bedroom with a gorgeous young bridesmaid - in the middle of the wedding celebrations. And Mr Bushell has already taken a liking to head porter Rocky Wesson with his \"When I was at the Hilton\" anecdotes. Most of the critics - including former Coronation Street producer Brian Park writing in the Sun - thought the Carlton production team had expertly handled the introduction of 30 new characters in the first episode. Gone are the drab 1970s soft-furnishings to make way for a slick new reception area, a water feature and - to the Independent's horror - Thai fishcakes. This is definitely a rebranded hotel for the 21st century. And there was more sex in the first 30 minutes than in Crossroads' previous 24-year history, with all of the young, glamorous characters veritably pulsating with hormones. As the Sun declared, \"the old dump has improved since we saw it last in 1988. They've made it a palace fit, if not for a king, then certainly for Alan Partridge.\" The Times described the programme as \"altogether slicker\" than in its previous incarnation while the Telegraph described it as \"pretty sturdy\". The well-publicised gay handyman Bradley Clarke managed to imbue his tussle with a young petrol thief with enough lust to put Blake and Alexis to shame. On the other hand, there is enough soap history to please the real trainspotters. Crossroads veteran Jill Harvey has been dusted down and moved to an executive suite. Played by Jane Rossington, she had the closing line of Crossroads back in 1988 and appropriately cropped up in one of the closing scenes last night. But, as Jaci Stephen of the Mail pointed out, such is the stress \"it takes her only until episode two to hit the bottle\". Some of the new actors are household favourites, such as Kathy \"Norah Batty\" Staff as Doris Luke and former Corrie star Sherrie Hewson in a new, glamorous guise. On the basis of first impressions, it's too good to be true. As Jaci Stephen observes: \"Meg Richardson will doubtless be turning in her grave - not least because of the extra cash Carlton has thankfully ploughed into the remake.\" And the Mirror's Mr Catchpole? \"On the evidence of the first 30 minutes, this is a confident, pacey, funny, sexy little soap which could wash the BBC's Neighbours down the plughole.\"",

      "body": "<p>The winter sunlight filters into the living room of Petra Brockm\u00f6ller's Amsterdam maisonette. Like the room, which is full of books, plants, fresh flowers and family pictures, Brockm\u00f6ller is cheerful and upbeat. She looks a healthy, fit 65. But she's suf fering from terminal cancer and knows the end is not far off. S</p> <p>he still enjoys life, walking miles each day, going to concerts and joining the younger colleagues she worked with before she retired a year ago for a drink, a few jokes and a meal. Her three children are all doing well and have given her four grandchildren, with a fifth on the way. But she is already talking to her doctor about helping her end her life when the time comes. She is confident she will be allowed to choose the timing and manner of her death - not in pain or sedated, but fully conscious and able to make her goodbyes to her children and grandchildren. \"Some people don't grow old; that's your fate. My philosophy is carpe diem . Take your life in your own hands as far as possible. I believe in reaching the age of 67 in freedom and not being dependent on anybody, rather than reaching 70 and not being able to do anything.\" </p> <p>A bill now going through the Dutch legislature will decriminalise a practice that has been judicially recognised in the Netherlands for nearly 30 years. The lower house passed it last November by a majority of more than two-thirds. It is expected to be accepted by the upper house next month and to come into force later this year. Euthanasia and assisting suicide have always been, and will remain, a criminal offence in the Netherlands. </p> <p>By agreement between the medical profession and the ministry of justice, doctors have not been prosecuted if they fulfilled certain conditions and reported the death to the coroner as an unnatural one. The patient must have asked to die and persisted in the request - taking a patient's life without a request still counts as murder. The doctor must be satisfied that the patient's suffering is unbearable and lasting and that there was no reasonable alternative, and must have consulted another independent doctor. These will remain the criteria. What the new act will do is to incorporate these grounds for immunity from prosecution into the criminal code. Doctors will not only escape prosecution if they follow the rules, but they will no longer be committing a criminal act. </p> <p>Those who disregard the rules will still risk a prosecution and possible murder conviction. Two weeks ago an Amsterdam GP, Wilfred van Oijen, was convicted of murder for injecting an 84-year-old woman with an anaesthetic drug without her request or a second opinion. The woman was in the last stages of death in a nursing home but had not been given pain-killing drugs ordered by the GP. She was covered in bed ulcers and nurses feared that washing her would kill her. Her daughters had urged him to end her suffering. The court declined to punish him for ending her life, saying he had acted \"honourably and according to his conscience\", and imposed a suspended fine for reporting that the death was from natural causes. </p> <p>Since 1990, 20 doctors have been charged with carrying out euthanasia outside the guidelines. In most cases the charges have been dropped. Some of those prosecuted have been acquitted, others convicted, but none has served a prison term. A murder conviction does not carry the automatic life sentence a British doctor could expect if convicted in similar circumstances, but Dutch doctors say the prosecution process is still harrowing. </p> <p>The procedure set up by the act will remove the fear of prosecution from those who scrupulously follow the rules. Three-person regional review committees, each consisting of a doctor, a lawyer and an ethicist (usually a clergyman), now look at all euthanasia and assisted suicide cases to see if they come within the criteria. At present, all cases also go to the public prosecution service for possible investigation. Once the act comes into force, the review committee will refer only doubtful cases to the prosecution authorities, although prosecutors will still be able to initiate their own investigations into a suspicious death. </p> <p>In the Dutch legislature, the leading opponent of euthanasia is Andre Rouvoet of the small Christian Union party. He asks: \"Is there any other crime where the one who commits the crime can make a report and be found guilty or not guilty by a non-judicial committee just on the basis of his own report?\" </p> <p>The Dutch point out that euthanasia happens in other countries but it goes on clandes tinely. They would prefer to have it out in the open where it can be monitored to minimise abuses. Fully decriminalising it will, they hope, encourage more doctors to report it. Despite the transparency, only 50 to 60% of cases are thought to be reported, up from 18% in a 1990 survey. A number, like the van Oijen case, undoubtedly happen without the patient's request. Some cases don't fall easily within the guidelines; some doctors are confronted with a patient in intractable pain and act immediately; others believe the patient's family deserve privacy. But there is no evidence that doctors act from any other motive than to relieve the patient's suffering. </p> <p>Euthanasia is not available on demand: two-thirds of requests are turned down. Doctors on the second opinion panel, who see the patients and produce their own report, are trained to help their colleagues resist the too importunate patient. Most patients have had the same GP for many years, and doctors are widely trusted. In 85% of cases, euthanasia is carried out not in nursing homes or hospitals, but by GPs in the patient's home. </p> <p>Patients must persist in their requests, which the criteria stipulate must be \"voluntary and well-considered\". Nico Mensing, a GP who also acts as a second opinion doctor, recalls his most difficult case. \"It was a young mother of 31 with three kids of five, three and six months. I had kids the same age. She had cancer over all her body. She suffered a lot for months and months. We talked for months about it.\" Even Rouvoet admits: \"I do have faith in our doctors and our medical system. I do not suspect any doctor of choosing easily the route of euthanasia and I'm convinced most doctors do not offer euthanasia to their patients. But when it comes up, it's a legal option and that doesn't help in encouraging investment in palliative care.\" </p> <p>The most controversial element of the bill, a provision allowing children of 12 and over to choose euthanasia without their parents' consent, was dropped. Children between 12 and 16 may opt for euthanasia but only with parental agreement. Those between 16 and 18 take their own decisions but parents must be involved. </p> <p>For the first time, the bill will allow euthanasia for patients unable to request it, if they made an advance directive - a \"living will\" - asking for it while they were still in full possession of their faculties. </p> <p>Most of the patients who choose euthanasia are in the final stages of cancer. But court cases over the years have established that euthanasia is not limited to cases of terminal illness, and that unbearable suffering may be psychological as well as physical. Advocates of the slippery slope argument point to the case in 1994, where a court refused to punish a psychiatrist who gave a 50-year-old former social worker suffering from pathological grief over the death of her two sons the means to kill herself. Some thought this was a case too far, though the rules stipulate that doctors must satisfy themselves that the patient's request does not stem from depression. </p> <p>Many, including the Royal Dutch Medical Society and the justice minister, felt the line was crossed last year when a court exonerated the doctor who helped the former senator Edward Brongersma, who had no serious physical or psychological illnesses but felt that at the age of 86 he was living \"a pointless and empty existence\", to die. The prosecuting authorities are appealing, as they have the right to do in the Netherlands. </p> <p>On the whole, though, more than 90% of the Dutch support euthanasia. They may wonder why so few other nations have followed their lead. One US state, Oregon, has allowed doctor-assisted suicide, but not euthanasia, for the last four years. In Australia, a law to legalise euthanasia was passed in the Northern Territory in 1995 but overturned by the Australian senate in 1997. The Netherlands' neighbour, Belgium, is only now considering a euthanasia bill. </p> <p>Johan Legemaate, professor of health law at Erasmus University, Rotterdam, says the Dutch system works because patients have a long-lasting relationship with a single GP, nursing home care is free so there are no economic pressures to shorten life, and the general attitude in society is to be open, not to cover up. \"If you have a country in which one or more of these elements is lacking, you should be very cautious.\"</p>",

The Today programme on Radio 4, which has attempted to cover the issue in depth, has taken much of the flak.</p> <p>The guidelines take account for the first time of the problems posed by the internet. Since the last election, the BBC's online news service has undergone a huge expansion.</p> <p>Online staff are warned to be aware of concerted email campaigns conducted by political activists, and talk forums must be monitored to ensure that they reflect a fair debate. Devolution also features strongly in the guidelines: network programmes must give time to Plaid Cymru and the SNP. Individual programmes do not have to be artificially balanced, but must give the different parties a fair hearing over the course of a week.</p> <p>The guidelines highlight the sensitivity of certain issues. \"Particular care should be taken over high-profile issues like Europe where there is a multi-faceted debate within and between the parties to ensure that a balance of views is maintained,\" the guidelines warn.</p> <p>Producers and editors are also warned over the dangers of opinion polls. The results of an opinion poll should never lead a news bulletin on their own, and the interpretation given to the results by the publication or organisation that commissioned it should not be relied upon.</p> <p>Great care must be taken with the language used to report political surveys: \"Polls 'suggest' but never 'prove' or even 'show',\" the guidelines say.</p> <p>The BBC said that the guidelines, developed by the corporation's editorial policy department, would \"help ensure balance and fairness during the campaign\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "The BBC has warned its reporters and programme-makers to be extra-sensitive over the issue of Europe during the run-up to the general election. In guidelines issued yesterday, the corporation said that issues such as Europe caused divisions within parties as well as between them, and all views should be fairly represented. The BBC has come under fire from all sides of the debate over its coverage of Europe. The Today programme on Radio 4, which has attempted to cover the issue in depth, has taken much of the flak. The guidelines take account for the first time of the problems posed by the internet. Since the last election, the BBC's online news service has undergone a huge expansion. Online staff are warned to be aware of concerted email campaigns conducted by political activists, and talk forums must be monitored to ensure that they reflect a fair debate. Devolution also features strongly in the guidelines: network programmes must give time to Plaid Cymru and the SNP. Individual programmes do not have to be artificially balanced, but must give the different parties a fair hearing over the course of a week. The guidelines highlight the sensitivity of certain issues. \"Particular care should be taken over high-profile issues like Europe where there is a multi-faceted debate within and between the parties to ensure that a balance of views is maintained,\" the guidelines warn. Producers and editors are also warned over the dangers of opinion polls. The results of an opinion poll should never lead a news bulletin on their own, and the interpretation given to the results by the publication or organisation that commissioned it should not be relied upon. Great care must be taken with the language used to report political surveys: \"Polls 'suggest' but never 'prove' or even 'show',\" the guidelines say. The BBC said that the guidelines, developed by the corporation's editorial policy department, would \"help ensure balance and fairness during the campaign\".",

Hundreds of hours of material have already been shot for the observational series but such is its sensitivity that all the tapes are under police guard. Bob Long, executive producer and director of the BBC2 series, described the footage as a \"remarkable\" insight into the disturbing criminal world of child pornographers. \"People won't have seen anything like this on TV before, it's a very difficult and tough subject,\" he said. Mr Long stressed that \"all of the tapes are kept under lock and key at Scotland Yard because there's a lot of child porn on them\". BBC cameras are following an investigation into an internet child-porn ring \"comparable\" to the Wonderland website smashed by police in late 1998 following an international operation. \"I think people watching this will learn an awful lot about the subject and how to protect their own children,\" he said. Mr Long, who works in the BBC documentaries and investigation group, spent two-and-a-half years negotiating access to the Scotland Yard paedophile unit. The documentary has been in production for eight months and filming is to continue for another five. The four-part series is expected to be delivered to BBC2 controller Jane Root next February. Mr Long is also executive producing a BBC2 documentary series about the Brighton gay scene. Brighton out of the Closet, which was described by Mr Long as an \"unapologetic\" look at the city's gay scene, is to be broadcast Monday to Thursday over two weeks in May.",

What makes this volume all the more surprising is that it coincided with an economic boom: GDP was growing by 3%. There always used to be an inextricable link between economic prosperity and traffic growth; recently there have been signs of it uncoupling. Both the fuel shortages during last autumn's protests and, more importantly, an 8% hike in fuel prices last year were responsible for the change.

Last year petrol campaigners were calling for a 26p cut in the price of petrol. That could have resulted in an additional 6% traffic growth - or 22bn extra car-kilometres a year. To put that in perspective, the additional growth would have meant 4m extra average length car trips of 14 kilometres every single day of the year.

The main elements are: \u0095 Royalty, which is paid at 12.5% of the landed value of the petroleum less an allowance for bringing petroleum onshore and treating it. Royalty is a condition of each oil production licence but not payable for any field approved after March 31 1982; \u0095 Petroleum Revenue Tax, which was introduced by the Oil Taxation Act 1975. PRT is a tax on profits related to separate fields charged on the difference between income and expenditure. PRT was reduced from 75% to 50% with effect from July 1 in the 1993 Finance Act to encourage further investment. It was abolished for fields approved after March 15 1993; \u0095 Corporation Tax, which is charged on the profits of oil and gas. It is the only tax applicable in the case of new fields. The main rate of CT is 30%. Both Royalty and PRT are deductible in calculating profits for CT purposes.",

Nearly 40 pharmaceutical companies claim that a new law which will permit the importation of generic drugs and patented medicines from suppliers at prices lower than those of the main drug giants breaches South Africa's constitution and international trade agreements. \"There can be no question that our rights are threatened,\" Fannie Cilliers, for the drug companies, told the court.

(Her very first CD, Acis and Galatea with the King's Consort, is still many a Handelian's number one choice.) But in the Netherlands, where she is now based, she has always been considered a specialist in contemporary music. And it was only when she took the title role in Berg's Lulu at Glyndebourne in 1996, and then returned to the company two years later to sing the Controller in Jonathan Dove's Flight, that British audiences began to recognise McFadden's full range as a performer. </p> <p>Tonight she dons her new music hat for a concert with the Nash Ensemble, part of their annual New Music Series. She will sing Harrison Birtwistle's The Woman and the Hare, the world premiere of which she gave just over two years ago. Birtwistle has described her voice as \"amazingly flexible and with a wide range of colours\". Not that she wasn't anxious when she first sang it for him. \"I was shaking ever so slightly, and wondering if what he had just heard was anywhere close to what he had been hearing in his own head,\" she says. \"And his first reaction was to ask me if I wanted anything changed . . . Harry has an incredible understanding of the human voice, and though the piece makes a lot of demands vocally and dynamically, it feels good singing it.\" </p> <p>The Woman and the Hare is about a woman (a notated speaking role for an actor, Julia Watson) who sees a hare being burnt in a field-fire on a moonlit night, and who comes to identify with the creature's suffering. The singer takes on the role of a Greek chorus, and elaborates the woman's emotions. McFadden talks about the need for the singer to \"colour\" the piece. What exactly does that mean? \"For me, the voice is the link between one's emotions and the outside world,\" she says. \"Babies express their needs directly through it, people's voices change when they're upset and, just as there are different gradations of emotion - of love, of anger, of desperate craving for a chocolate fix - I try to express this subtlety in the colours of my voice. I assume my audience come to a piece blank, and it's my job to communicate the emotions of a piece to them the best way I can.\" </p> <p>McFadden was born in Rochester, New York state, into a family whose members all possessed a good set of lungs but little knowledge of \"European\" classical music. She discovered this for herself at grammar school, and received a grant to study in the Netherlands. </p> <p>Her first opera job was as Zerbinetta in a Dutch production of Ariadne auf Naxos in 1989. \"I've always loved acting,\" she says, \"even from when I was a child. But when I got on stage I realised I couldn't act my way out of a paper bag. I was wild and full of unharnessed energy, but I was around all these seasoned performers like Rita Cullis.

She personifies what an artist is all about, taking risks, daring to go beyond the boundaries of safety and convention. It takes courage to share your vulnerability.\" Does this mean there's a bluesy old jazzer inside McFadden, waiting to get out? \"I listen to a lot of non-classical music at home, but I don't get many opportunities to sing it.\" She pauses wistfully. \"But if I could scat like Sarah . . .\" </p> <p>\u0095 Claron McFadden sings with the Nash Ensemble at the Purcell Room, London SE1 (020-7960 4242), tonight.</p>",

There were two others still alive among them.</p> <p>Mr Betts and his assistant, Darren Bailey, were asked to help unload the tomatoes so that customs and immigration officials could search the container properly. When the men arrived at the lorry, others had begun to remove the tomatoes, stacked in a specially constructed frame to stop their collapse on to the illegal immigrants. Mr Betts and Mr Bailey were the first people to climb inside the lorry.</p> <p>\"When I got to the area people were already unloading boxes. I could clearly see the body of a young Chinese man where the boxes had been, possibly a teenager,\" said Mr Betts in a statement read out at the fourth day of the trial at Maidstone crown court. \"Myself and Darren Bailey got inside and I can remember it was very hot - when refrigerated containers carrying fruit are normally cold.</p> <p>\"We were clearing tomatoes from around this male's body, and as I shone my torch in and peered past the wooden structures holding up the boxes into the darkness, I was confronted by a sea of bodies which all appeared to be motionless.</p> <p>\"It was very hot in this part of the trailer and I shouted to colleagues to get ambulances. I could see a young boy who was tapping the side of the container to try to attract our attention. Darren was trying to coax him out but he appeared reluctant. After a few moments he started to come towards us. As I helped him out I had my hands and arms around his bare chest, as he wasn't wearing a shirt, and he was incredibly hot for a human.</p> <p>\"I remember seeing another young man moving and he began climbing over other bodies, we helped him out. It was clear there was no one else alive. I can remember a paramedic checking the first body in the container for a pulse and saying he was dead.\"</p> <p>In his statement, Mr Bailey said that when he arrived it was clear \"this was not the normal run-of-the-mill unloading job\". His statement said: \"There were tomatoes all over the floor and there was commotion. I immediately saw one male half buried, at the rear of the lorry. It appeared he had been trying to get under a gap in the pallets, and had collapsed.\"</p> <p>Mr Bailey described how he helped the first survivor to safety after hearing him tapping on the side of the lorry.</p> <p>\"I could see a body moving so I called for quiet and a torch. I could see a person, which I believe was a teenage girl, she was lying still with her mouth open and eyes closed. I thought the floor was covered in fallen pallets. After taking a proper look I realised it was covered with bodies.</p> <p>\"I heard a noise, and looked left and saw a young boy eating a tomato. We gestured for him to come out. I told him he was okay and he came out.\"</p> <p>Lisa Quigley, a customs dog handler at the scene, described Wacker's reaction on hearing that there could be bodies in the lorry. \"He looked stunned,\" she said. \"He looked at me and said 'What?'\" Ms Quigley also said that Wacker had laughed when one of the officers dropped a box of the tomatoes. \"I heard the driver chuckle ...and he was smiling,\" she said.</p> <p>Andrew Smith, a customs and excise freight anti-smuggling officer, told the court that Wacker's lorry had been stopped because the company to which it was registered, Van Der Speck Transport, was not known to officials at Dover, and the driver had paid cash.</p> <p>Mr Smith's first reaction on opening the rear doors was surprise, the court heard: \"I expected it to be cold,\" he said. \"Usually there is a blast of cold air but it was warm air.\"</p> <p>The crown alleges that Wacker and his co-defendant, Ying Guo, an interpreter, were part of a Chinese snakehead trafficking gang and had conspired to organise the transport.</p> <p>Wacker denies 58 counts of manslaughter and four counts of conspiracy to smuggle people into Britain. Guo, 29, of South Woodford, Essex, denies a count of conspiracy to smuggle immigrants into the UK.</p> <p>The trial continues.</p>",

As I helped him out I had my hands and arms around his bare chest, as he wasn't wearing a shirt, and he was incredibly hot for a human. \"I remember seeing another young man moving and he began climbing over other bodies, we helped him out. It was clear there was no one else alive. I can remember a paramedic checking the first body in the container for a pulse and saying he was dead.\" In his statement, Mr Bailey said that when he arrived it was clear \"this was not the normal run-of-the-mill unloading job\". His statement said: \"There were tomatoes all over the floor and there was commotion. I immediately saw one male half buried, at the rear of the lorry. It appeared he had been trying to get under a gap in the pallets, and had collapsed.\" Mr Bailey described how he helped the first survivor to safety after hearing him tapping on the side of the lorry. \"I could see a body moving so I called for quiet and a torch. I could see a person, which I believe was a teenage girl, she was lying still with her mouth open and eyes closed. I thought the floor was covered in fallen pallets. After taking a proper look I realised it was covered with bodies. \"I heard a noise, and looked left and saw a young boy eating a tomato. We gestured for him to come out. I told him he was okay and he came out.\" Lisa Quigley, a customs dog handler at the scene, described Wacker's reaction on hearing that there could be bodies in the lorry. \"He looked stunned,\" she said. \"He looked at me and said 'What?'\" Ms Quigley also said that Wacker had laughed when one of the officers dropped a box of the tomatoes. \"I heard the driver chuckle ...and he was smiling,\" she said. Andrew Smith, a customs and excise freight anti-smuggling officer, told the court that Wacker's lorry had been stopped because the company to which it was registered, Van Der Speck Transport, was not known to officials at Dover, and the driver had paid cash. Mr Smith's first reaction on opening the rear doors was surprise, the court heard: \"I expected it to be cold,\" he said. \"Usually there is a blast of cold air but it was warm air.\" The crown alleges that Wacker and his co-defendant, Ying Guo, an interpreter, were part of a Chinese snakehead trafficking gang and had conspired to organise the transport. Wacker denies 58 counts of manslaughter and four counts of conspiracy to smuggle people into Britain. Guo, 29, of South Woodford, Essex, denies a count of conspiracy to smuggle immigrants into the UK. The trial continues.",

They should be ashamed.\"</p> <p>The Zimbabwean president earned worldwide criticism for the arbitrary deportation of \"foreign\" journalists two weeks ago. One was BBC correspondent Joe Winter, the other Mercedes Sayagues, a 47-year-old Uruguayan national, single mother, freelance reporter for the South Africa-based weekly Mail and Guardian, and occasional Observer contributor. This week, Mugabe is guest of honour in Paris, welcomed as head of state by President Chirac.

The international outcry initially provided a useful screen as friends came in and out to sell her car, to bring clothes, ornaments, books, cups and cutlery to share out among friends, and to deliver mail.</p> <p>But soon the situation became more fraught. Sayagues' picture was on every TV station every hour. The government said her home had been abandoned and described her as a \"prohibited immigrant\" which meant that she could be grabbed from the street without explanation. Trips outside needed a bodyguard - \"lent\" by a female opposition MP. On the final trip to her lawyer, it started pouring with rain. \"We had to use umbrellas for camouflage,\" she says. \"I had a huge black one pulled down to cover my face; the only other one was Esmerelda's pink mermaid umbrella.

From 1990 she worked for the UN world food programme as a senior information officer, moving to Zimbabwe in 1992. Two years later, she lost her impressive UN salary after being ordered to a new posting in Yugoslavia at the same time as apartheid was ending in South Africa. \"It was financial suicide but how could I leave?\"</p> <p>She stayed on and began working as a journalist. Her main outlet outside Africa was the Worldwoman web paper which I edit. Founded in 1999, it's an online newspaper written by women around the world, which aims to give a northern voice to southern journalists in developing countries without liberty or profile in their own country.</p> <p>Last year she wrote about the farcical election that kept Mugabe in power, describing one opposition rally and its bloody aftermath. She attacked \"that nice man\" former vice president Gore for supporting the big US pharmaceutical companies such as Glaxo as they tried to prevent poor governments developing generic versions of drugs to treat HIV. She also discussed a huge taboo - the fact that the male preference for dry sex has a significant impact on HIV transmission rates across Southern Africa. Women use herbal powders to prevent lubrication during intercourse, which can result in tearing and easier virus transmission.</p> <p>It takes a remarkable doggedness to keep optimism and journalistic standards high in such a situation. When I first met Sayagues, two years ago, she brought to a halt my training seminar on editoral skills by demanding an apology. It seems a local Harare organiser had urged journalists to commit for the entire day's training or not to come. Impossible for a freelance, she said; impossible for a single mother. Of course she was right.

      "body": "<p>Geil auf Horno! \" the sticker on the door to Michael Gromm's Berlin flat announces to visitors. The slogan translates into \"Horny for Horno!\" Though lacking in subtlety, it succinctly sums up the passion that the Englishman feels for the tiny east German village. He has been fighting to save Horno (population: 330) from total destruction by mining for more than eight years.</p> <p>Gromm, a postman's son, grew up in London, near Hampstead Heath. But he has lived in Germany since 1974. He feels more comfortable speaking German than his native tongue. But Gromm is also a Sorb - the only Sorb in the world, he claims, to hold a British passport. The Sorbs are a little-known 60,000-strong Slavic minority that has lived in what is now the eastern edge of Germany for at least 13 centuries. Gromm discovered that he had Sorb blood while researching a novel in the early 1990s. He traced his roots to a Sorb village 15km across the border in Poland called Chlebowa in Polish or Niemasch Kleba - Sorbian for \"Haven't got any bread\".

The black robe stands for those he blames for Horno's woes, Germany's judicial system.</p> <p>He calls lignite (brown coal) mining the \"messenger of death for Sorb culture\". Opencast mines wiped out about 100 Sorb villages in the 20th century - 73 during communist rule in East Germany. More than 20,000 people lost their homes.

About 1.5km to the south, where there was once a forest, the \"Horno Mountain\", the highest hill for miles, is being chewed away by a herd of bulldozers and digging machines. Beyond the rise is a view of Horno's possible fate: an 80m- to 90m-deep man-made valley of brown and black layers. A 650m-long steel leviathan straddles the valley. The mining company that operates it, Laubag, calls it \"the world's largest movable technical device\". While coal is dug out from the bottom of the valley by other machines and transported to the massive J\u00e4nschwalde power plant up the road, this \"conveyor bridge\" travels back and forth, shaving away virgin land. It dumps it on to the other side of the pit, filling it up again as it moves north, towards Horno, at a rate of 10m a week.</p> <p>\"The edge [of the mine] is just one-and-a-half kilometres away. Some of the older people, they just can't cope,\" says the mayor, Bernd Siegert. As he sips a beer in his cosy living room, Siegert's forehead is creased with worry. \"A lot of the people here are being forced to move for the second time in their lives,\" he adds, referring to the massive influx of German - many of whom were ethnic Sorb - refugees from what is now Poland after the second world war.</p> <p>After German reunification in 1990, the Hornoers were given new hope when the country's then chancellor, Helmut Kohl, announced in an election campaign speech in nearby Cottbus that lignite mining - which has long been the economic lifeblood of the region - would be kept alive, but that no more Sorb villages would be destroyed.</p> <p>The villagers quickly learned not to trust campaign promises, and were soon embroiled in a battle against both Laubag and the state government of Brandenburg. Despite a clause in the state's post-reunification constitution explicitly protecting Sorb villages, politicians began to toe the line of the energy and mining industries, as well as the miners' union. Each of these vested interests shouted: \"But we have to save the jobs.\"</p> <p>Laubag was formed in 1992 by the privatisation of the former East German state mining firm, on the promise that jobs would be saved. They weren't: in 1989 more than 100,000 people were employed in East Germany's lignite-mining industry; less than 10,000 jobs remain. \"It's an economic disaster,\" Gromm says. \"The jobs are gone.

He has fought for his rights as a member of the Sorb minority and as a Horno property owner: the village council gave him a three square metre triangular traffic island.

Once the sale of Laubag to Vattenfall has been finalised, he plans to stage a \"spectacular action\" in Sweden and launch a worldwide appeal to minority organisations to put pressure on Vattenfall and the Swedish government. \"What interest does the Swedish people have in the destruction of Sorb villages in Germany?\" asks Gromm.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the earth-churning monster creeps towards Horno. At the yet-to-be-built New Horno, Laubag is supposed to provide housing of \"equal worth\" for the displaced inhabitants. \"If they have golden taps in the old house, we have to replace them,\" says Roger Kohlmann, a spokesman for the company. \"In fact, they will probably end up making a profit.\" But for the many Horno residents who hang on to the very German concept of Heimat , a home rooted in land and community, such promises don't offer much comfort.

      "bodyText": "Geil auf Horno! \" the sticker on the door to Michael Gromm's Berlin flat announces to visitors. The slogan translates into \"Horny for Horno!\" Though lacking in subtlety, it succinctly sums up the passion that the Englishman feels for the tiny east German village. He has been fighting to save Horno (population: 330) from total destruction by mining for more than eight years. Gromm, a postman's son, grew up in London, near Hampstead Heath. But he has lived in Germany since 1974. He feels more comfortable speaking German than his native tongue. But Gromm is also a Sorb - the only Sorb in the world, he claims, to hold a British passport. The Sorbs are a little-known 60,000-strong Slavic minority that has lived in what is now the eastern edge of Germany for at least 13 centuries. Gromm discovered that he had Sorb blood while researching a novel in the early 1990s. He traced his roots to a Sorb village 15km across the border in Poland called Chlebowa in Polish or Niemasch Kleba - Sorbian for \"Haven't got any bread\". While spending time in the area, he became interested and, finally, deeply involved in the story of Horno. Gromm becomes impassioned and animated when discussing the plight of the village.

But the livestock farmers grow steadily more angry at the time taken to cull and burn the infected cases; and as the suspected cases edge nearer to us all the stomach-churning fear bites even harder. Our friends are still waiting to hear whether they are a confirmed, rather than a suspected case, and this is driving them insane - and they have a calf with a big blister. They are angry that the Ministry of Agriculture (Maff) has not even rung to see if things are worse. The tests were taken on February 27 and still they wait . . .</p> <p>Keeping track of the known cases is becoming increasingly hard. I have a map marked with crosses and this helps me to plan routes if and when we need to leave the farm. My daughter Victoria's dental brace has broken which means a special trip to the dental hospital in Newcastle to get it fixed. I've mapped out a special route to Newcastle, avoiding all the farms that are officially confirmed to have foot and mouth, but this will add 20 minutes to our expected journey time. It's normally 28 miles, but I think it will be far more.</p> <p>Peter is very anxious, as am I, yet we are so busy sorting out day-to-day problems that somehow we keep going. Sleeping is easier as the numbing worry induces exhaustion and this eventually knocks us out, although not every night.</p> <p>Just now, Peter is welding a gate and post back together from the cattle shed; the electricity supply flickers as he welds. Overnight the yearling cattle (last year's calves) broke down the solid metal gate-posts and mixed with the cows and new calves. No lasting damage was done to any of the animals, but it all takes time to sort out and this is time that should be spent in getting ready for lambing at the end of the month.</p> <p>The task of the day is to move straw and hay bales from one shed to another so that we can begin to build 120 individual sheep pens from wooden hurdles, tied together with the \"farmer's friend\" - baler twine. Once the ewes have lambed they spend one or two days inside, so the lambs can gain in strength.</p> <p>Education in the area is still severely disrupted, as anyone with any contact with animals is told to stay away - and this affects both the teachers and the children. Our children have been stuck at home since half-term. Julie and Nick Howard farm near Allendale, 25 miles away: Julie is the science teacher at Allendale middle school. Since last week she has been barred from school and the strain is beginning to tell. She does not want to leave either her husband to fend for himself, or her pupils to remain untaught especially since the key stage-two science tests are due soon. And on top of that her two eldest daughters, Laura and Vicky, are studying for A and AS levels and GCSEs respectively.</p> <p>Plans are being made today to try to send Laura to stay with friends as she has been offered an RAF scholarship to study medicine at Edinburgh on condition of three A grades. And Haydon Bridge high school is believed to be taking advice from the examination board on changing GSCE course work dates for its affected pupils.</p> <p>As for the cyclist who literally barged through our cows last week, one of our neighbours did see and challenge him, as it turns out. They weren't sure whether to send him back or let him go, however. Eventually they let him pass, but he said he was local, which we all think is much worse. Since the snow drifts were so high everyone is wondering why he was even out.</p> <p>Another neighbouring farmer, John Browell, is trying to get a movement order from Maff to bring back 130 ewes to their main farm from another field three miles away - his sheep are due to start lambing any day. These movement restrictions, however necessary, could not come at a worse time for many sheep farmers, especially flocks farther south, since March and April is peak lambing season.\u0095 The writer and her husband run a livestock farm near Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland.

For 70 years of the 20th century it owned the politics and government of its country. The voters saw it as the party of the nation. But now it is a foreign party. It has become something altogether other. This means that anyone who votes for it next time may be doing so for the last time. People should understand this. Unless they do so very soon, an independent and sovereign Conservative party will become nothing more than an offshore pimple on the British body politic.</p> <p>Its transformation has been extraordinarily sudden. So much history was sacrificed so fast, burned on the pyres of zealotry and desperation. The philistines, who remember nothing, are now in charge. Insofar as they know history, they despise its compromises. Like the Taliban, they seem bent on smashing every memorable idol, above all the claim they once had to be the party of the British people.</p> <p>This claim goes back longer than 70 years. Throughout the 19th century, Conservatives adapted to the society around them. That's why they enjoyed a longer continuous history than any other European party. From Peel to Disraeli, they became the party of one English nation. From Baldwin to Macmillan, they rode the tides of peacetime Britain, banishing ideology, speaking for the people, sucking up the votes. From Edward Heath to Margaret Thatcher, they remained at the centre of the centre ground, wherever that came to be defined. They were, in fact, its definers. Mrs Thatcher became an ideologue, but she was not foreign. She knew what the British people wanted. From this position she won three elections.</p> <p>Now, something important has changed. The state of society is no longer the Conservatives' guide to political survival. For society, they say, is mistaken. Instead of listening to the people, the Tories want to fight them. The people have made some big mistakes. They gave Labour a landslide victory in 1997. From there the people have gone downhill all the way. After four years, they continue to reward Mr Blair with a 15-point lead in the opinion polls. Something must be wrong. It isn't, of course, the Conservative party. The party is in denial about all that.</p> <p>The people, for example, have watched their country being parcelled up and given away. Scottish devolution was agreed by the Scots and accepted by the English, and is working in conformity with a promise made at the last election. But the Conservatives cannot credit that. By raving against its iniquities, they announce their distance from the people. They are stepping away from being fully British. This is only the beginning of a hallucination that Disraeli and Macmillan and even the pre-retirement Thatcher strove always to discourage: the belief that the people cannot be right.</p> <p>That judgment reaches into every cranny of what Labour has done. The government's persistent popularity is simply, we learn, an error. The British people are prepared to pay their taxes, they want better public services, and support the chancellor and prime minister who have been in charge of the modest social democratic progress of the last four years. But in Tory eyes, this is an aberration. The government's anti-progressive side, also popular, is another fraud. Having been even more reactionary than the Tories on issues of liberty and law, asylum and immigration, Blair and Straw may have gained votes, but this is all part of a package designed to take the country from the \"decent, plain-speaking people\", as the Tory leader called them this weekend.</p> <p>Only a party that has become foreign - alien - could seriously believe that. Conservatism, we discover from William Hague and Michael Ancram, is alienated from reality. It doesn't merely believe that Blair, the people's choice by a mile, is wrong. It says that he is not, at a deeper level, entitled to be prime minister. That was the message from Harrogate, with its references to the \"stench\" of Blairism, as compared with the simon-pure days of John Major. It has become the seigneurial presumption of Mr Ancram, a mild man now evincing apocalyptic rage at the presence of these filthy upstarts in the seats of power, stealing the very birthright of the British - the same British people who are about to cast the Tories once again into electoral darkness.</p> <p>There are those who believe the latest Conservative synthesis is a pose, and that the party is not really accelerating towards the fringe. Forgive them their madness, they have nothing else to say. Wait until they get back to power, we are assured. They'll sober up, regain their balance. In particular, wait for this moment to see the return of realism on the issue where, at present, they are most obsessed with the image of the theft of a nation: Europe.</p> <p>The chances of this happening seem slight. For a start, until they remake contact with the centre ground, they will never get back. But leave that small point aside, and observe the depth of their unrepentance. Call them extreme, and they reach further towards xenophobia, sneering at foreign doctors. Call them racist, and they plumb the richer subtexts of political incorrectness, vowing to lock up all asylum seekers, implying that foreigners are not welcome, suggesting that Britain will soon no longer be Britain because of them.</p> <p>Call Hague reactionary, and he plunges deeper into promises of more prison than Mr Straw. Call him a nationalist, and he exposes hostility for the European Union of a breadth he's never shown before. He promises to march into the EU demanding a new agriculture policy, a new fishing policy and a torn-up treaty of Nice. These statements do not connect with reality. They say nothing about the 14 member-states whose agreement would be needed, nor about the consequences of their refusing it. But we learn what there is to know about the modern viscera of the party Hague leads: its virulent passions, its deluded fixations, the myopia that prevents it focusing on a world beyond itself, its belief in the defiant journey up its own backside.</p> <p>This is not the posture that kept the Conservatives alive for two centuries. Nor will it do so now. The party is becoming a foreign body. Instead of being in touch with the people, Hague describes a country they do not recognise. When he says they're living in a place that no longer belongs to them, they look at him as though he's crazy. Far from pointing to the broad uplands, he plunges deeper into the fetid cave that offers very temporary security. Fearful and disgusted, Michael Heseltine even contemplates not voting Conservative. Habit called him back, but he thought about it publicly. Disraeli would have seen such a danger coming. Macmillan would have learned the lesson. Thatcher spent a decade keeping the broad church together. But modern Conservatism neither understands nor respects the people.

Mr Hibberd refused, citing state laws which allow a journalist to protect a source. The man told Mr Hibberd that he was a management professional and family man with a \"healthy income\". He said he had no previous convictions and that the idea of the arson attacks came to him as he was mountain biking. 'Terrorist threat' The FBI in Phoenix confirmed this week that they were investigating at least 10 separate arson attacks. An FBI spokeswoman in Portland said that the ELF had now claimed responsibility for more than 20 attacks. She said the group had been declared a \"terrorist threat\" by the FBI and department of justice. The ELF keeps in touch with its supporters via its earthliberationfront.com website, which currently shows a photo of a burning building on its home page. It also includes advice on what to do \"if an [FBI] agent knocks\". In the latest Earth First, a member of the ELF denies that the activists are terrorists. \"We condemn all forms of terrorism. We are trying to cost the rich sprawl corporations enough money so they stop destroying the planet and the health, well-being and existence of humankind.\"",

      "body": "<p>The career of Jack McVea, who has died aged 86, could serve as a template for the kinds of stylistic adjustments required of African-American jazz musicians of his generation. Having started out as a sideman in big bands, where he built a reputation as a fine tenor-saxophone soloist, he achieved chart success in the 1940s with the r&amp;b nonsense song, Open The Door, Richard. Its fame enabled him to tour successfully for months on end with his small combo until fashions changed.</p> <p>McVea's father had been a musical pioneer in Los Angeles whose advertisements in the Yellow Pages, under his band name of Satchel McVea and his Howdy Entertainers, brought work playing at parties given by movie stars, or providing entertainment on set during the silent film era. His son was soon caught up in this heady activity, playing banjo from the age of 12 before moving on to saxophone when a member of the band died.</p> <p>After leaving school in 1932, McVea was proficient enough on alto and tenor saxophones to work with all the best groups on Central Avenue, the main thoroughfare of black Los Angeles, including those of now-forgotten leaders like Dootsie Williams, Lorenzo Flemioy, and Cee Pee Johnson. 0ne highlight was a shortlived unit, led by the former Cab Calloway soloist Eddie Barefield, that also included tenor star Don Byas, whose muscular solo style proved a major influence on McVea.</p> <p>Another key encounter came when he played alongside the young Art Pepper in Lee Young's band at the Club Alabarn. \"Art couldn't play the arrangements; I taught him to read,\" McVea remembered.</p> <p>His first major break came in 1940 when Lionel Hampton, fresh from his success with Benny Goodman, formed his own big band. McVea was persuaded to play baritone saxophone, looking on as the teenage Illionis Jacquet grabbed the limelight with Flying Home. In 1943, McVea returned to Los Angeles exhausted and ill, opting to concentrate on his studio calls, jam sessions for Norman Granz - including the first-ever Jazz at the Philharmonic concert, where he battled persuasively with Jacquet - and recording. He also formed the first of many small groups, inspired by the success of Louis Jordan, developing a brand of swingy, blues-orientated music best described as \"jump jazz\".</p> <p>Something of an innovator in this, McVea seemed to have hit a happiness nerve for the burgeoning numbers of African-Americans attracted to Los Angeles by war work. His success accelerated with the recording of Open the Door, Richard, based on a routine popular in black vaudeville. With McVea listed as co-composer, this piece of flim-flam was covered by everyone from Count Basie to Louis Jordan, setting off a series of \"response\" numbers - and, people thought, surely earning McVea a fortune. Not so. In an overly-familiar scenario, he was denied his royalties, due to record company chicanery, only obtaining partial restitution later.</p> <p>Now fronting the Door Openers, McVea recorded and toured non-stop, with his wife Louise Beatty as vocalist, threading his way up and down the west coast until the early 1960s, when pop edged out r&amp;b. Forced to collect scrap-metal for a living, he was relieved when Disneyland asked him to beguile visiters as a strolling clarinettist on their site in Orange County, with the Royal Street Bachelors. He put in 25 years of service, and was grateful to live out his retirement bolstered by a Disney pension.</p> <p>Always affable and happy to answer researchers' questions, McVea was predeceased by his wife. He is survived by three daughters and a son.</p> <p>\u0095 Jack McVea, jazz musician and bandleader, born November 5 1914; died December 27 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "The career of Jack McVea, who has died aged 86, could serve as a template for the kinds of stylistic adjustments required of African-American jazz musicians of his generation. Having started out as a sideman in big bands, where he built a reputation as a fine tenor-saxophone soloist, he achieved chart success in the 1940s with the r&amp;b nonsense song, Open The Door, Richard. Its fame enabled him to tour successfully for months on end with his small combo until fashions changed. McVea's father had been a musical pioneer in Los Angeles whose advertisements in the Yellow Pages, under his band name of Satchel McVea and his Howdy Entertainers, brought work playing at parties given by movie stars, or providing entertainment on set during the silent film era. His son was soon caught up in this heady activity, playing banjo from the age of 12 before moving on to saxophone when a member of the band died. After leaving school in 1932, McVea was proficient enough on alto and tenor saxophones to work with all the best groups on Central Avenue, the main thoroughfare of black Los Angeles, including those of now-forgotten leaders like Dootsie Williams, Lorenzo Flemioy, and Cee Pee Johnson. 0ne highlight was a shortlived unit, led by the former Cab Calloway soloist Eddie Barefield, that also included tenor star Don Byas, whose muscular solo style proved a major influence on McVea. Another key encounter came when he played alongside the young Art Pepper in Lee Young's band at the Club Alabarn. \"Art couldn't play the arrangements; I taught him to read,\" McVea remembered. His first major break came in 1940 when Lionel Hampton, fresh from his success with Benny Goodman, formed his own big band. McVea was persuaded to play baritone saxophone, looking on as the teenage Illionis Jacquet grabbed the limelight with Flying Home. In 1943, McVea returned to Los Angeles exhausted and ill, opting to concentrate on his studio calls, jam sessions for Norman Granz - including the first-ever Jazz at the Philharmonic concert, where he battled persuasively with Jacquet - and recording. He also formed the first of many small groups, inspired by the success of Louis Jordan, developing a brand of swingy, blues-orientated music best described as \"jump jazz\". Something of an innovator in this, McVea seemed to have hit a happiness nerve for the burgeoning numbers of African-Americans attracted to Los Angeles by war work. His success accelerated with the recording of Open the Door, Richard, based on a routine popular in black vaudeville. With McVea listed as co-composer, this piece of flim-flam was covered by everyone from Count Basie to Louis Jordan, setting off a series of \"response\" numbers - and, people thought, surely earning McVea a fortune. Not so. In an overly-familiar scenario, he was denied his royalties, due to record company chicanery, only obtaining partial restitution later. Now fronting the Door Openers, McVea recorded and toured non-stop, with his wife Louise Beatty as vocalist, threading his way up and down the west coast until the early 1960s, when pop edged out r&amp;b. Forced to collect scrap-metal for a living, he was relieved when Disneyland asked him to beguile visiters as a strolling clarinettist on their site in Orange County, with the Royal Street Bachelors. He put in 25 years of service, and was grateful to live out his retirement bolstered by a Disney pension. Always affable and happy to answer researchers' questions, McVea was predeceased by his wife. He is survived by three daughters and a son. \u0095 Jack McVea, jazz musician and bandleader, born November 5 1914; died December 27 2000",

At 89, he was prepared to make yet another run at the governorship of Minnesota, the state which had put him in the record books as - at 31 - the youngest governor in US history.

She was a crucial figure in reshaping relations between the black community and the police in south London, but her influence stretched far wider, touching the very heart of national policing policy.</p> <p>Born in Portland, Jamaica, Arlene was the granddaughter of a prosperous businessman and the daughter of an RAF warrant officer. When she was two, her family moved to Hong Kong, where her earliest memories were of life on the military base as the only black family. She recalled no overt racism, just a sense of being different and special - qualities which continued to set her apart.</p> <p>In the late 1950s, her grandfather brought the family to Brixton, south London, where she and her sisters went to the Dick Sheppard school. At the age of 16, she began work as a secretary and switchboard operator. In her early 20s, she married Lascelves Mundle and had two children, Rascelles and Acqua, though the marriage broke up shortly afterwards. Later, she met Cecil \"Junior\" Williams, with whom she had a daughter, Cassandra. Attracted by his sense of life's possibilities, she recalled this as her happiest period.</p> <p>By the mid-1980s, Arlene was enjoying the showy affluence of the times, earning good money as an escort in West End clubs. It was also the period in which crack- cocaine started appearing in Britain, and Arlene's life took a downward turn as she became sucked into the world of drugs and crime. In the mid-90s, Junior and Arlene separated. Arlene knew it was time to turn her life around.</p> <p>There was another blow when her friend Brian Douglas died in police custody in 1995. His family mounted a campaign to press for justice, and Arlene threw herself into this activity with a passion and fury. This was her first encounter with the community police consultative group in Lambeth, which was to become the platform from which she launched her public career.</p> <p>Arlene's temper was legendary, and, at first, her anger at the racism and injustice she perceived as endemic in police relations with black people boiled at an almost uncontrollable pitch.

She met Stephen Lawrence's parents and, through various campaigns, started to understand more about police work.</p> <p>Arlene saw how black victims of crime were being poorly served by the police, but, more controversially, believed change would only come if the black community engaged with the authorities to push for it. No one pushed harder than she did.</p> <p>Her direct approach and unorthox methods - telephone calls in the early hours, even to senior officers, were her trademark - came as a culture shock to the Metropolitan police. But at a time when the police needed to listen, she had plenty to say, so she was employed to provide a much-needed community perspective for senior officers on training exercises, and to advise an operation tackling drug-related gun crime, codenamed Trident.</p> <p>At times, Arlene jeopardised her own safety, but she was never afraid to speak out against the villains on her doorstep, and took the lead in promoting a highly successful firarms amnesty in Lambeth. During the tension that followed the Brixton nailbombing in 1999, she was a conduit of understanding between grassroots black feeling and the police investigation.</p> <p>When her cancer was diagnosed just before Christmas last year, messages of support came in from chief constables and from public figures such as Neville Lawrence, the home secretary Jack Straw, and the former football star Ian Wright. Two months ago, she received a Metropolitan police commissioner's commendation.</p> <p>Everything Arlene achieved was done through her own efforts. Tragically, her illness struck just as she was to embark on a law degree at Southampton University. Her life was about transformation and she would have become a fine lawyer. She is survived by her three children and her mother.</p> <p><b> Penny Wrout </b></p> <p>Lee Jasper writes: Arlene Mundle was the kind of person whom you felt you had known for years. In that sense she was an \"old soul\". I first met her through my association with the Brian Douglas Family Campaign in 1995.</p> <p>Working for me at the 1990 Trust, she had convinced me of the need to speak publicly about how the black community could work with the police to tackle crack-cocaine gun violence. It was a difficult position to take. Nevertheless, she worked hard to ensure I spoke about these issues publicly. Make no mistake, Arlene gave me the confidence to speak out. Her enthusiasm was infectious.</p> <p>Over the years, she developed leadership skills and became a figure in her own right. To me, she was my sister and confidant. In Jamaican terms, she was my key spar. Her work will remain a shining testimony to her selfless dedication.</p> <p>Arlene Mundle, community leader and police adviser, born August 17 1953; died March 2 2001</p>",

But at a time when the police needed to listen, she had plenty to say, so she was employed to provide a much-needed community perspective for senior officers on training exercises, and to advise an operation tackling drug-related gun crime, codenamed Trident. At times, Arlene jeopardised her own safety, but she was never afraid to speak out against the villains on her doorstep, and took the lead in promoting a highly successful firarms amnesty in Lambeth. During the tension that followed the Brixton nailbombing in 1999, she was a conduit of understanding between grassroots black feeling and the police investigation. When her cancer was diagnosed just before Christmas last year, messages of support came in from chief constables and from public figures such as Neville Lawrence, the home secretary Jack Straw, and the former football star Ian Wright. Two months ago, she received a Metropolitan police commissioner's commendation. Everything Arlene achieved was done through her own efforts. Tragically, her illness struck just as she was to embark on a law degree at Southampton University. Her life was about transformation and she would have become a fine lawyer. She is survived by her three children and her mother. Penny Wrout Lee Jasper writes: Arlene Mundle was the kind of person whom you felt you had known for years. In that sense she was an \"old soul\". I first met her through my association with the Brian Douglas Family Campaign in 1995. Working for me at the 1990 Trust, she had convinced me of the need to speak publicly about how the black community could work with the police to tackle crack-cocaine gun violence. It was a difficult position to take. Nevertheless, she worked hard to ensure I spoke about these issues publicly. Make no mistake, Arlene gave me the confidence to speak out. Her enthusiasm was infectious. Over the years, she developed leadership skills and became a figure in her own right. To me, she was my sister and confidant. In Jamaican terms, she was my key spar. Her work will remain a shining testimony to her selfless dedication. Arlene Mundle, community leader and police adviser, born August 17 1953; died March 2 2001",

      "bodyText": "One of the Queen's more arcane prerogatives - her control over churches such as Westminster Abbey, quaintly known as Royal Peculiars - was placed under notice yesterday with the publication of a report suggesting that their management should be dragged into the 21st century. An official inquiry called for the appointment of a standing commission, including lay members, tacitly to curtail the independence of the peculiars and their governing deans and chapters, who have retained almost medieval powers over how they are run. Such a move - if accepted by the Queen and the government - would have the effect of distancing her from what has been a series of acrimonious disputes over the running of the abbey. The inquiry team's 116-page report stated: \"The key question is whether the Royal Peculiars should continue to be treated as unique institutions or whether, in the light of modern developments in both church and public life, they should accept more of the character of cathedrals ... in organisation and outside links.\" Westminster Abbey, the site of coronations and other state occasions, which last year had an income of \u00a38.7m, with more than 200 staff and 1.25m tourists, is still governed by statutes settled in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, in 1560. The other peculiars - so called because they are under the authority of the Queen rather than the Archbishop of Canterbury or a diocesan bishop - are St George's Chapel, Windsor, and the chapels Royal at St James's Palace, the Tower of London and Hampton Court. The statutes of St George's are even older than those at the abbey, having been granted by King Edward III with the aid of a Papal Bull securing its independence in the 14th century. The inquiry, under Professor Averil Cameron, warden of Keble College, Oxford, was set up two years ago, partly in the wake of the sacking of Martin Neary, the abbey's organist, by the dean, Wesley Carr - an event described in the report as \"a difficult episode\". More recently, the dean has been criticised for his handling of parental criticisms over the running of the abbey's choir school, whose headmaster was forced out last week. Professor Cameron and one of the other members of the inquiry team, the Dean of York, Raymond Furnell, said their proposals would introduce \"useful checks and balances\" into how the peculiars are run. Asked whether the reforms would prevent capricious behaviour by a dean and chapter, Prof Cameron said: \"It would be a very useful safeguard.\" The report says the standing commission should consist of no less than three and no more than five persons, all appointed by the crown, including a senior bishop as chairman, a judge and someone with financial expertise. The commission would oversee the annual accounts of each peculiar, receive an an nual report and \"where possible exercise a mediating role in the settlement of disputes\". It suggests the controversy over the sacking of Dr Neary would not have occurred if such procedures had been in place. Employees with a grievance would still have the right to appeal to the Queen, though their cases would be dealt with by ad-hoc committees of the commission. The report claims that the abbey has been subjected to a \"sustained campaign of criticism ... some of it extremely unpleasant in character. Although this criticism is often ill-informed, it has undoubtedly had a damaging effect.\" The abbey's critics claimed last night that the report was a whitewash, which would have little effect on the daily running of the Royal Peculiars. Judge Christopher Compston said: \"The dean continues to be haunted and taunted by the effects of the Neary dispute.\" Dr Carr said: \"[We] have been working hard to improve the way the abbey is run ... so we are encouraged by the commission's recognition of very considerable achievement in this direction and their commendation of our success.\"",

It was the fifth anniversary of the Labour government's abolition of special category status which recognised that republican (and loyalist) inmates were political prisoners in everything but name.</p> <p>Sands's sister, Bernadette Sands-McKevitt, was a founder member of the 32-County Sovereignty Committee, which is to the Real IRA what Sinn Fein is to the Provisional IRA. \"Bobby clearly stated what he believed he was dying for, and that was the sovereign independence of his country,\" she told me shortly after Sinn Fein entered the all-party talks that finally led to the Good Friday agreement of 1998.</p> <p>To the Real IRA and its followers, the Provisionals led by Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness have usurped Bobby Sands's name and betrayed the principle for which he died by putting away their guns and signing up to a partitionist solution that leaves the \"Brits\" as entrenched as ever in the north. The dissidents believe, as the provos once believed, that Irish unity will be achieved only with gun and bomb and not by getting into bed with the enemy. Hence the explosion at the BBC.</p> <p>Bernadette Sands-McKevitt said her brother did not die for the peace process embraced by Adams and McGuinness. \"It's not what most of the volunteers in the Irish Republican Army would have gone out and given their lives for - the freedom of their country.\" Her words still strike the rawest of nerves in grassroots Provisionals and their families who have lost fathers and sons in the \"war\" and yet still give their support to the leadership, however apprehensive they may be.</p> <p>The dramatic image of a great orange ball of fire rising outside the main studios of the British Broadcasting Corporation in the Brits' capital city is a reminder of where they all came from. The Provisionals used to say that a bomb in London is worth 10 in Belfast. The bomb at the BBC was probably worth double in terms of global exposure, telling the world, and especially the paymasters in America and elsewhere, that at least one IRA was still in business.</p> <p>The repeated warnings by MI5 and special branch that more mainland attacks were to be expected after the Real IRA's rocket attack on the M16 headquarters (which damaged the paintwork but little more), were well founded. The Real IRA is believed to have been well penetrated north and south of the border - witness the number of arrests made and the number of operations thwarted. But however good the intelligence cover, it can never be 100% complete. Canary Wharf proved that.</p> <p>Yet the Real IRA might never have got off the ground. It was founded late in 1997 after an extraordinary IRA army convention in the tiny village of Falcarragh in north-west Donegal. The convention was called at the instigation of the IRA's then quartermaster general - a powerful figure in his own right - and his supporters, who were bent on engineering a coup in opposition to the \"peace\" strategy of the IRA leadership.</p> <p>They advocated an end to the IRA's ceasefire and a renunciation of senator George Mitchell's \"principles\" of non-violence. Adams and McGuinness spoke against them and won the day. The quartermaster general resigned, along with a handful of associates who held key positions in his department and the IRA's \"engineering\" division. What they lacked in numbers, they made up in experience and expertise.</p> <p>Soon afterwards, a member of the IRA's army council is believed to have advocated a \"night of the long knives\" to finish off the dissidents before they could pose a serious threat to the Provisionals. Wiser counsels prevailed - after all, the IRA was on ceasefire. Nevertheless the quartermaster general and other prominent defectors were visited by senior IRA men and left in no doubt as to their fate should they touch the IRA's dumps.</p> <p>No action was taken, presumably because the dumps were not touched. There was no need to. The Real IRA soon established its own sources of money and guns and attracted a new generation of young recruits, many of whom were \"clean skins\" without security force traces on either side of the border.</p> <p>Many thought that the Real IRA was finished after the horror of Omagh in August 1998 when 29 people died. Reports of its demise were premature, as the BBC bomb and the growing series of attacks in Northern Ireland were to prove. It is too simplistic to say that the television centre was targeted purely in revenge for Panorama's award-winning expose of those alleged to be responsible for Omagh - although the connection would hardly have escaped the bombers' minds.</p> <p>Sunday's explosion not only shook the BBC but rocked the peace process it was designed to sabotage. The guiding principle of Adams and McGuinness in steering the IRA and Sinn Fein along the precarious path to peace, overturning many of the cardinal tenets of republicanism in the process, was to keep the republican movement together. To date that has been their great and largely unsung achievement.</p> <p>The BBC bomb is bound to cause them concern, not because they suddenly fear mass defections, but because it gives the Real IRA a critical credibility and makes it a powerful rallying point for dissidents at a time when the peace process appears to be delivering little to republicans.

Although the IRA has pledged not to hand over a single bullet, it has taken the unprecedented step of opening up a couple of its bunkers to independent inspection.

      "bodyText": "Peter Fell was drunk, depressed and alone when he made a phone call that he would regret for the rest of his life. A fantasist and inveterate attention seeker, he dialled 999 and \"confessed\" to murdering two women who were walking their dogs on Hungry Hill, just outside Aldershot, Hampshire. He gave the wrong date for the killings, burped and was mostly incoherent during a conversation that was hard for the police operator to take seriously. Yet despite repeatedly insisting to detectives that he made up the whole story because he wanted \"to be somebody\", it was only yesterday - after 17 years in jail for double murder - that Mr Fell proved he was innocent . He was freed by Lord Justice Waller at the court of appeal, who quashed his conviction, saying it was unsafe. The decision left Mr Fell, now 40, relieved that his nightmare was finally over and Hampshire police stung by allegations that officers had put pressure on him to confess. It also meant that the mystery of who stabbed Ann Lee and Margaret \"Peggy\" Johnson in mid-afternoon on May 10, 1982, has yet to be solved. Their deaths horrified the country and led to a huge police investigation involving 100 officers. Mrs Lee, 44, left her home in Highfield Gardens, Aldershot, with her labrador, Monty, to meet Mrs Johnson, 66, who lived in a nearby bungalow and owned a red setter called Tara. The two women were about halfway round their regular walk on the common when they were attacked and stabbed repeatedly with a double-edged knife. Blood Mrs Lee, a mother of two, was discovered lying on the path at the top of a small hillock. Monty was pining by her side. Mrs Johnson, a grandmother who had been married for 47 years, was 20 yards away slumped by a five-bar gate where she had run to escape. The lower rungs were covered in blood. Although the murders had been committed in daylight and the bodies found close to an army base, there were no witnesses. Robbery and rape were ruled out as potential motives and no weapon was found. There were two suspicious sightings on the day; a man wearing a camouflage jacket and a lorry driver - crying, with his head in his hands - seen close to the murder scene. The police dismissed both. Mr Fell, however, had already tried to implicate himself. On the evening of the murder, he staggered out of a pub in Aldershot and called the police. He told an officer he had met a man who had told him he was the killer. Mr Fell said the man lived at 10 York Road - his own address. The police did nothing, so Mr Fell rang again the next day and offered the same information. It was another two weeks before he was questioned and then he was ruled out as a suspect. Detectives concluded he could not have been on the common at the time of the murder, and in any event, there was no motive.

I know the phone calls and all that ... that's only because I wanted to be someone. I'm nobody.\" During subsequent interviews, Mr Fell made a partial confession which he immediately retracted. He'd said he'd met the two women and had struck one of them with a stick because she looked like his mother. In the book Trial and Error, author David Jessell describes how officers were taped saying to Mr Fell \"the sooner you see clear, my sunshine, the better\", and \"from the day you started to walk you lied.\" Still protesting his innocence, Mr Fell was convicted of both murders in August, 1984, at the end of a 19-day trial at Winchester crown court. Mr Fell's tendency to make things up was well-known to the police. During a spell in the army as a cook, he twice lied about being attacked by civilians. He also claimed he was an army boxing champion - another fantasy. He even tried to incriminate himself in the Yorkshire Ripper murders by phoning the police and giving them his name. His disturbed childhood also made him prone to attention seeking. His parents split up when he was three, and two sets of foster parents had given him up, leaving him in the care of a children's home. After considering his background and details of the confession, the criminal cases review commission referred the case back to the court of appeal in September, 1999. Vulnerable During the hearing, Patrick O'Connor, QC, accused the police of putting Mr Fell under pressure when he was in a particularly vulnerable state. He also pointed to psychiatric evidence that showed Mr Fell was emotionally vulnerable and had a \"suggestible\" personality. A psychologist, Gisli Gudjonsson, testified that he had had doubts about the reliability of Mr Fell's confession since 1988. Following the quashing of the conviction, Mr Fell said he wanted to start afresh. \"If I dwell on it, it will just do me more harm, so I don't want to dwell on it. I'll just take one day at a time. I have always believed that one day I would be proved innocent,\" he said. Asked why he confessed to the murders, he replied: \"I used to say a lot of silly things but did not realise they would be used against me at the trial.\" Mr Fell will probably be due a substantial sum in compensation.

The men were convicted in 1990 of involvement in a conspiracy to drive up the price of Guinness shares during a takeover battle.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Confusion reigned yesterday, with stock market bears giving <strong> Baltimore Technologies</strong> a mauling as rumours of a massive share placing swept through the City. </p> <p>The internet security firm shed more than 6%, or 14.5p to 219.5p, amid speculation that the former shareholders of a company named Content Technology were preparing to dump 27m Baltimore shares - some 6% of the company - on to the market. </p> <p>The speculation was traced to a note published by Jonathan Crozier, a security software analyst at German broker WestLB Panmure. </p> <p>In the note, Mr Crozier lowered his rating on Baltimore to \"market underperform\" and said that 27m shares belonging to the former Content shareholders were being released from a lock-up next Thursday. </p> <p>He went on to say that Balti more's chief executive, Fran Rooney, stated at a recent analysts' meeting that he was having discussions with the company's brokers - Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch - about placing the shares in the market. </p> <p>While Mr Rooney may or may not be talking to his brokers about placing the shares, sources close to Baltimore insist that Mr Crozier - who has just taken up coverage of Baltimore - has got his figures wrong. They say the number of shares eligible for sale next week is 7.25m - with a further 11m due to be unlocked on April 25. </p> <p>Baltimore acquired Content, an email security company, last year for \u00a3691m in shares, making millionaires of its founders. In October, Content shareholders decided to cash in some of their Baltimore shares in a placing arranged by Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. </p> <p>The session's other juicy story also derived from a placing. Dealers could not understand why <strong> Pearson</strong> fell 64p to \u00a314.97p. After all, the media company - which owns the Financial Times - had posted better than expected figures. </p> <p>Towards the end of the session the reason emerged. Ac cording to traders, Goldman Sachs was contacting the City's biggest institutions to see if they would be interested in buying Telefonica of Spain's 4% stake in Pearson. </p> <p>In the interim, leading shares bounced back from Friday's two-year low, with the FTSE 100 closing 72.7 points higher at 5,931.3, after a rally in the telecoms sector. </p> <p> <strong> Vodafone</strong> and <strong> BT</strong> contributed the bulk of the gains - with the former rising 7.75p to 189.75p ahead of tomorrow's annual investors' day, and the latter adding 27.5p to 559.5p on renewed speculation that its chairman, Sir Iain Vallance, is to retire early. </p> <p> <strong> Marconi </strong>, up 38p to 485p, and <strong> Colt Telecom </strong>, 87p highger at \u00a312.29, also chipped in with useful gains. </p> <p>Elsewhere, the FTSE Techmark 100 closed 53.43 points higher at 2,301.86, led by <strong> ARM Holdings </strong> , 24.5p better at 334.5p, and <strong> Logica </strong> , 113p stronger at \u00a314.84. Yet traders remained unconvinced by the market's performance. </p> <p>Turnover was light, suggesting that the majority of the buying was related to short sellers closing their positions. </p> <p>Senior traders said institutional money was being held back until the Budget, on Wednesday, and the meeting of the monetary policy committee, on Thursday, were out of the way. </p> <p>Moreover, the lead from New York simply could not be trusted. Although the Nasdaq was higher by the time London closed, volumes were also light as much of Wall Street was staying at home because of a severe storm. </p> <p>The flipside of the move back into the technology and telecoms sectors was underperformance from old economy favourites such as <strong> Dixons</strong> and <strong> Marks &amp; Spencer </strong> . </p> <p>Dixons ended 6.25p lower at 243.5p on reports that Merrill Lynch had lowered its recommendation to \"neutral\" ahead of the publication of the latest British Retail Consortium data. Apparently, electricals had another tough month in February. </p> <p> <strong> Marks &amp; Spencer</strong> lost 10.25p to 226.75p on concerns about trading.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Confusion reigned yesterday, with stock market bears giving Baltimore Technologies a mauling as rumours of a massive share placing swept through the City. The internet security firm shed more than 6%, or 14.5p to 219.5p, amid speculation that the former shareholders of a company named Content Technology were preparing to dump 27m Baltimore shares - some 6% of the company - on to the market. The speculation was traced to a note published by Jonathan Crozier, a security software analyst at German broker WestLB Panmure. In the note, Mr Crozier lowered his rating on Baltimore to \"market underperform\" and said that 27m shares belonging to the former Content shareholders were being released from a lock-up next Thursday. He went on to say that Balti more's chief executive, Fran Rooney, stated at a recent analysts' meeting that he was having discussions with the company's brokers - Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch - about placing the shares in the market. While Mr Rooney may or may not be talking to his brokers about placing the shares, sources close to Baltimore insist that Mr Crozier - who has just taken up coverage of Baltimore - has got his figures wrong. They say the number of shares eligible for sale next week is 7.25m - with a further 11m due to be unlocked on April 25. Baltimore acquired Content, an email security company, last year for \u00a3691m in shares, making millionaires of its founders. In October, Content shareholders decided to cash in some of their Baltimore shares in a placing arranged by Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch. The session's other juicy story also derived from a placing. Dealers could not understand why Pearson fell 64p to \u00a314.97p. After all, the media company - which owns the Financial Times - had posted better than expected figures. Towards the end of the session the reason emerged. Ac cording to traders, Goldman Sachs was contacting the City's biggest institutions to see if they would be interested in buying Telefonica of Spain's 4% stake in Pearson. In the interim, leading shares bounced back from Friday's two-year low, with the FTSE 100 closing 72.7 points higher at 5,931.3, after a rally in the telecoms sector. Vodafone and BT contributed the bulk of the gains - with the former rising 7.75p to 189.75p ahead of tomorrow's annual investors' day, and the latter adding 27.5p to 559.5p on renewed speculation that its chairman, Sir Iain Vallance, is to retire early. Marconi , up 38p to 485p, and Colt Telecom , 87p highger at \u00a312.29, also chipped in with useful gains. Elsewhere, the FTSE Techmark 100 closed 53.43 points higher at 2,301.86, led by ARM Holdings , 24.5p better at 334.5p, and Logica , 113p stronger at \u00a314.84. Yet traders remained unconvinced by the market's performance. Turnover was light, suggesting that the majority of the buying was related to short sellers closing their positions. Senior traders said institutional money was being held back until the Budget, on Wednesday, and the meeting of the monetary policy committee, on Thursday, were out of the way. Moreover, the lead from New York simply could not be trusted. Although the Nasdaq was higher by the time London closed, volumes were also light as much of Wall Street was staying at home because of a severe storm. The flipside of the move back into the technology and telecoms sectors was underperformance from old economy favourites such as Dixons and Marks &amp; Spencer . Dixons ended 6.25p lower at 243.5p on reports that Merrill Lynch had lowered its recommendation to \"neutral\" ahead of the publication of the latest British Retail Consortium data. Apparently, electricals had another tough month in February. Marks &amp; Spencer lost 10.25p to 226.75p on concerns about trading.",

Remaining Hertz shares will be acquired in a merger at the same price in about a week. Refinancing of TWA proposed An investor group headed by investment banker Brian Freeman said it had submitted a plan to reorganise bankrupt Trans World Airlines with $650m (\u00a3442m) in financing from financier Carl Icahn. The offer is intended as an alternative to the sale of TWA to American Airlines parent AMR - planned by TWA and AMR. Other groups, including Jet Acquisitions Group and Global Airlines, have also submitted buyout offers as alternatives to AMR's plan. Those bids are being considered as part of an auction of TWA's assets. TWA met with bidders yesterday as part of the court-ordered auction process. The Freeman group's offer would not be part of the auction but proposes a reorganisation outside of that process. Biotech firm plans listing British biotech firm Oxford Biomedica aims to raise \u00a320m-\u00a330m this month ahead of its move to a full London Stock Exchange listing, a company spokesman said yesterday. Oxford Biomedica, which is working on gene therapy treatment for cancer and other diseases, has already secured interest from institutional shareholders, and a share offering is expected to be completed in two or three weeks. Equitable offers bonus hope Troubled insurer Equitable Life said yesterday it will consider recommencing the payment of guaranteed bonuses to policyholders later this year as it issued its payout figures for 2000. It announced rates of return for the year of 3.3% for most pension policies and 2.8% for products such as endowments. Policyholders had to forgo seven months' investment growth to cover liabilities.",

The move, by the Unity party, the second biggest caucus in the duma, follows similar calls by the communists a fortnight ago. The surprise move could bring down the government of the prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, trigger the dissolution of parliament and herald fresh elections only 15 months into the life of the current duma. Although the Kremlin enjoys broad support from a comparatively docile parliament, new elections could see Unity, a Putin instrument, supplant the communists as the biggest party in the duma and guarantee Mr Putin even greater uncritical backing. Rumours have been circulating in Moscow since the start of the year about Mr Putin wanting to be rid of the prime minister and undertake a cabinet reshuffle, but it was not clear if the Kremlin was behind last night's move. Frants Klintsevich, deputy head of Unity in parliament, said a final decision would be taken today on whether a vote of no confidence would be taken. \"We don't think the government is working badly. We want to dissolve the duma and have new parliamentary elections,\" he said. Between them, Unity and the communists can comfortably muster the 226 votes needed for the no confidence motion to succeed. The Kremlin could ignore the result, but would have to respond to a second no confidence vote by either replacing the government or dissolving parliament. Mr Klintsevich said a first vote of no confidence could take place next week and new elections could happen in September. Boris Gryzlov, the Unity leader in parliament, predicted that his party would take up to 40% of seats in new elections, about double the tally it won in December 1999. It was clear that Unity would base its campaign on a simple single issue of support for President Putin, hoping to capitalise on his huge approval ratings of around 70%. Mr Putin is due to hold a one-hour internet conference later today, during which he will answer the questions of journalists from Russian online sites.

      "bodyText": "A nursery teacher was yesterday found guilty of grievous bodily harm after breaking a two-year-old's arm when he fidgeted during a nap. Helen Lamb, 27, from Cheadle Hulme, Greater Manchester, denied harming the boy. A jury at Manchester crown court was told how the teacher at the private Greenbank nursery school must have twisted the boy's arm until he howled. She then made him sit on his own with his arm dangling from its socket. On January 6 last year, Lamb's class of nine, aged 18 months to two years, were settled on to mattresses for an afternoon nap, though the boy was settled onto a beanbag because he did not care too much for a nap. Lamb's co-teacher, Lisa Dare, 20, left Lamb in charge while she went for lunch. Susan Klonin, prosecuting, said it was impossible to determine what happened when the boy was alone with Lamb. But it was likely that the child had wanted to leave his beanbag, and was yanked back because Lamb did not want to be disturbed. She said the fracture could not have been taken for an accident or gone unnoticed. \"It would have caused him to cry out in pain for a significant time.\" After the verdict, Kevin Phillips, headteacher of Greenbank, said he had undertaken an extensive review of procedure. Judge Stuart Fish adjourned sentencing for three weeks.",

      "bodyText": "Portugal faced a political crisis yesterday as popular outrage grew over the worst national tragedy for decades when a rusting roadbridge collapsed and killed 70 people. A busload of 64 day trippers, including many children, and the occupants of two cars met their deaths in the murky, swollen waters of the northern river Douro. The river swept away a 76-metre stretch of iron bridge and a 30-metre high stone pillar. The narrow, rusty structure now reaches just half way across the river. Jagged points of torn metal mark the spot where the iron was wrenched apart. Yesterday it emerged that cracks had earlier been spotted in the bridge's structure and the town hall had been campaigning for a new bridge for more than a decade. Distraught and angry families huddled in the mist above the river waiting for news. \"There were complete families on that bus,\" said Rui Cesar, a town councillor. \"There must have been many, many children in there.\" He said the tragedy would leave deep scars in Castelo da Paiva, a market town of 17,000 people. \"I know at least one friend of mine was in there. Everybody has lost someone they know or someone from their family,\" he said. A senior government minister, Jorge Coelho, whose public works ministry is responsible for rail and road transport, yesterday announced his \"irrevocable\" resignation from the government. The prime minister, Antonio Guterres, was jeered when he arrived in Castelo de Paiva to witness the recovery operation. He pledged a full investigation. \"What if it had been your son?\" one man shouted at him. The government declared two days of national mourning from today, with flags on public buildings to fly at half-mast. Eduardo Moreira, a local man who was the only eyewitness to the accident, said he saw the lights of the bus under the water as it sank and was pulled downstream by the current. \"They suddenly disappeared, I couldn't believe it,\" he said. \"The current is massive.\" Rescue workers admitted that strong winds and a fierce current were hampering the search for bodies. By late afternoon only three bodies had been pulled from the river. Two of them were found about two miles downstream - a sign of the strength of the Douro's current. A temporary morgue set up at a local sports centre remained empty. Mr Coelho said that 70 people were thought to have been travelling in the three vehicles that plummeted into the river, while the local mayor, Paulo Teixeira, said he believed 77 people had died. \"Whole families have been lost,\" he said. National fire service divers suspended operations shortly before dark because of the risks posed by the fast-flowing water, although teams in boats continued to probe the banks for bodies. \"If conditions in the water do not change, we run a tremendous risk of seeing a further tragedy,\" a senior diver, Vitor Hugo, said. Mr Teixeira said he had repeatedly warned the government of the parlous state of the 116-year-old bridge, which was built for horse-drawn carts rather than motor vehicles. \"I warned a long time ago about the state of that bridge and I have fought as hard as I can to get it replaced,\" Mr Teixeira said. There were already restrictions on vehicles with heavy loads crossing the bridge. \"We have even held press conferences on that bridge to warn how dangerous it is,\" Mr Cesar added. Convoys of troops continued to arrive late into the day to assist with the search, but could do little more than join the onlookers. Police officers were posted along the dam at Lever, 12 miles downstream. \"We are waiting for the bodies to appear here, but we have not seen a thing,\" admitted one officer. In Castelo da Paiva, locals blamed political ineptitude and a company that extracts sand from a stretch of river beside the bridge. The sand, known locally as white gold, is used for the construction industry. \"They take three boatloads a day from the river,\" said Lucia Serreira, who lives beside the bridge. Locals said engineers from the University of Oporto had claimed three years ago that the bridge's pillars were shaking. Lots of people gathered on the roadsides of villages near the bridge yesterday asking those who drove past for information about friends and relatives. These were the villages which had waved whole families off on a twin-decked bus for a day's outing on Sunday. They had gone to see the almond trees blossoming further up the Douro valley. Yesterday their families were demanding that they at least be given bodies to mourn. Portuguese politicians, unable to explain how the bridge was allowed to disintegrate, were unable to promise that the bodies would be retrieved soon.

      "body": "<p>The winter sunlight filters into the living room of Petra Brockm\u00f6ller's Amsterdam maisonette. Like the room, which is full of books, plants, fresh flowers and family pictures, Brockm\u00f6ller is cheerful and upbeat. She looks a healthy, fit 65. But she's suf fering from terminal cancer and knows the end is not far off. She still enjoys life, walking miles each day, going to concerts, and joining the younger colleagues she worked with before she retired a year ago for a drink, a few jokes and a meal. Her three children are all doing well and have given her four grandchildren, with a fifth on the way. But she is already talking to her doctor about helping her end her life when the time comes. She is confident she will be allowed to choose the timing and manner of her death - not in pain or sedated, but fully conscious and able to make her goodbyes to her children and grandchildren. \"Some people don't grow old; that's your fate. My philosophy is carpe diem . Take your life in your own hands as far as possible. I believe in reaching the age of 67 in freedom and not being dependent on anybody, rather than reaching 70 and not being able to do anything.\"</p> <p>A bill now going through the Dutch legislature will decriminalise a practice that has been judicially recognised in the Netherlands for nearly 30 years. The lower house passed it last November by a majority of more than two-thirds. It is expected to be accepted by the upper house next month and to come into force later this year. Euthanasia and assisting suicide have always been, and will remain, a criminal offence in the Netherlands. By agreement between the medical profession and the ministry of justice, doctors have not been prosecuted if they fulfilled certain conditions and reported the death to the coroner as an unnatural one. The patient must have asked to die and persisted in the request - taking a patient's life without a request still counts as murder. The doctor must be satisfied that the patient's suffering is unbearable and lasting and that there was no reasonable alternative, and must have consulted another independent doctor. These will remain the criteria. What the new act will do is to incorporate these grounds for immunity from prosecution into the criminal code. Doctors will not only escape prosecution if they follow the rules, but they will no longer be committing a criminal act.</p> <p>Those who disregard the rules will still risk a prosecution and possible murder conviction. Two weeks ago an Amsterdam GP, Wilfred van Oijen, was convicted of murder for injecting an 84-year-old woman with an anaesthetic drug without her request or a second opinion. The woman was in the last stages of death in a nursing home but had not been given pain-killing drugs ordered by the GP. She was covered in bed ulcers and nurses feared that washing her would kill her. Her daughters had urged him to end her suffering. The court declined to punish him for ending her life, saying he had acted \"honourably and according to his conscience\", and imposed a suspended fine for reporting that the death was from natural causes.</p> <p>Since 1990, 20 doctors have been charged with carrying out euthanasia outside the guidelines. In most cases the charges have been dropped. Some of those prosecuted have been acquitted, others convicted, but none has served a prison term. A murder conviction does not carry the automatic life sentence a British doctor could expect if convicted in similar circumstances, but Dutch doctors say the prosecution process is still harrowing.</p> <p>The procedure set up by the act will remove the fear of prosecution from those who scrupulously follow the rules. Three-person regional review committees, each consisting of a doctor, a lawyer and an ethicist (usually a clergyman), now look at all euthanasia and assisted suicide cases to see if they come within the criteria. At present, all cases also go to the public prosecution service for possible investigation. Once the act comes into force, the review committee will refer only doubtful cases to the prosecution authorities, although prosecutors will still be able to initiate their own investigations into a suspicious death.</p> <p>In the Dutch legislature, the leading opponent of euthanasia is Andre Rouvoet of the small Christian Union party. He asks: \"Is there any other crime where the one who commits the crime can make a report and be found guilty or not guilty by a non-judicial committee just on the basis of his own report?\"</p> <p>The Dutch point out that euthanasia happens in other countries but it goes on clandes tinely. They would prefer to have it out in the open where it can be monitored to minimise abuses. Fully decriminalising it will, they hope, encourage more doctors to report it. Despite the transparency, only 50 to 60% of cases are thought to be reported, up from 18% in a 1990 survey. A number, like the van Oijen case, undoubtedly happen without the patient's request. Some cases don't fall easily within the guidelines; some doctors are confronted with a patient in intractable pain and act immediately; others believe the patient's family deserve privacy. But there is no evidence that doctors act from any other motive than to relieve the patient's suffering.</p> <p>Euthanasia is not available on demand: two-thirds of requests are turned down. Doctors on the second opinion panel, who see the patients and produce their own report, are trained to help their colleagues resist the too importunate patient. Most patients have had the same GP for many years, and doctors are widely trusted. In 85% of cases, euthanasia is carried out not in nursing homes or hospitals, but by GPs in the patient's home.</p> <p>Patients must persist in their requests, which the criteria stipulate must be \"voluntary and well-considered\". Nico Mensing, a GP who also acts as a second opinion doctor, recalls his most difficult case. \"It was a young mother of 31 with three kids of five, three and six months. I had kids the same age. She had cancer over all her body. She suffered a lot for months and months. We talked for months about it.\" Even Rouvoet admits: \"I do have faith in our doctors and our medical system. I do not suspect any doctor of choosing easily the route of euthanasia and I'm convinced most doctors do not offer euthanasia to their patients. But when it comes up, it's a legal option and that doesn't help in encouraging investment in palliative care.\"</p> <p>The most controversial element of the bill, a provision allowing children of 12 and over to choose euthanasia without their parents' consent, was dropped. Children between 12 and 16 may opt for euthanasia but only with parental agreement. Those between 16 and 18 take their own decisions but parents must be involved.</p> <p>For the first time, the bill will allow euthanasia for patients unable to request it, if they made an advance directive - a \"living will\" - asking for it while they were still in full possession of their faculties.</p> <p>Most of the patients who choose euthanasia are in the final stages of cancer. But court cases over the years have established that euthanasia is not limited to cases of terminal illness, and that unbearable suffering may be psychological as well as physical. Advocates of the slippery slope argument point to the case in 1994, where a court refused to punish a psychiatrist who gave a 50-year-old former social worker suffering from pathological grief over the death of her two sons the means to kill herself. Some thought this was a case too far, though the rules stipulate that doctors must satisfy themselves that the patient's request does not stem from depression.</p> <p>Many, including the Royal Dutch Medical Society and the justice minister, felt the line was crossed last year when a court exonerated the doctor who helped the former senator Edward Brongersma, who had no serious physical or psychological illnesses but felt that at the age of 86 he was living \"a pointless and empty existence\", to die. The prosecuting authorities are appealing, as they have the right to do in the Netherlands.</p> <p>On the whole, though, more than 90% of the Dutch support euthanasia. They may wonder why so few other nations have followed their lead. One US state, Oregon, has allowed doctor-assisted suicide, but not euthanasia, for the last four years. In Australia, a law to legalise euthanasia was passed in the Northern Territory in 1995 but overturned by the Australian senate in 1997. The Netherlands' neighbour, Belgium, is only now considering a euthanasia bill.</p> <p>Johan Legemaate, professor of health law at Erasmus University, Rotterdam, says the Dutch system works because patients have a long-lasting relationship with a single GP, nursing home care is free so there are no economic pressures to shorten life, and the general attitude in society is to be open, not to cover up. \"If you have a country in which one or more of these elements is lacking, you should be very cautious.\"</p>",

She is confident she will be allowed to choose the timing and manner of her death - not in pain or sedated, but fully conscious and able to make her goodbyes to her children and grandchildren. \"Some people don't grow old; that's your fate. My philosophy is carpe diem . Take your life in your own hands as far as possible. I believe in reaching the age of 67 in freedom and not being dependent on anybody, rather than reaching 70 and not being able to do anything.\" A bill now going through the Dutch legislature will decriminalise a practice that has been judicially recognised in the Netherlands for nearly 30 years. The lower house passed it last November by a majority of more than two-thirds. It is expected to be accepted by the upper house next month and to come into force later this year. Euthanasia and assisting suicide have always been, and will remain, a criminal offence in the Netherlands. By agreement between the medical profession and the ministry of justice, doctors have not been prosecuted if they fulfilled certain conditions and reported the death to the coroner as an unnatural one. The patient must have asked to die and persisted in the request - taking a patient's life without a request still counts as murder. The doctor must be satisfied that the patient's suffering is unbearable and lasting and that there was no reasonable alternative, and must have consulted another independent doctor. These will remain the criteria. What the new act will do is to incorporate these grounds for immunity from prosecution into the criminal code. Doctors will not only escape prosecution if they follow the rules, but they will no longer be committing a criminal act. Those who disregard the rules will still risk a prosecution and possible murder conviction. Two weeks ago an Amsterdam GP, Wilfred van Oijen, was convicted of murder for injecting an 84-year-old woman with an anaesthetic drug without her request or a second opinion. The woman was in the last stages of death in a nursing home but had not been given pain-killing drugs ordered by the GP. She was covered in bed ulcers and nurses feared that washing her would kill her. Her daughters had urged him to end her suffering. The court declined to punish him for ending her life, saying he had acted \"honourably and according to his conscience\", and imposed a suspended fine for reporting that the death was from natural causes. Since 1990, 20 doctors have been charged with carrying out euthanasia outside the guidelines. In most cases the charges have been dropped. Some of those prosecuted have been acquitted, others convicted, but none has served a prison term. A murder conviction does not carry the automatic life sentence a British doctor could expect if convicted in similar circumstances, but Dutch doctors say the prosecution process is still harrowing. The procedure set up by the act will remove the fear of prosecution from those who scrupulously follow the rules. Three-person regional review committees, each consisting of a doctor, a lawyer and an ethicist (usually a clergyman), now look at all euthanasia and assisted suicide cases to see if they come within the criteria. At present, all cases also go to the public prosecution service for possible investigation. Once the act comes into force, the review committee will refer only doubtful cases to the prosecution authorities, although prosecutors will still be able to initiate their own investigations into a suspicious death. In the Dutch legislature, the leading opponent of euthanasia is Andre Rouvoet of the small Christian Union party. He asks: \"Is there any other crime where the one who commits the crime can make a report and be found guilty or not guilty by a non-judicial committee just on the basis of his own report?\" The Dutch point out that euthanasia happens in other countries but it goes on clandes tinely. They would prefer to have it out in the open where it can be monitored to minimise abuses. Fully decriminalising it will, they hope, encourage more doctors to report it. Despite the transparency, only 50 to 60% of cases are thought to be reported, up from 18% in a 1990 survey. A number, like the van Oijen case, undoubtedly happen without the patient's request. Some cases don't fall easily within the guidelines; some doctors are confronted with a patient in intractable pain and act immediately; others believe the patient's family deserve privacy. But there is no evidence that doctors act from any other motive than to relieve the patient's suffering. Euthanasia is not available on demand: two-thirds of requests are turned down. Doctors on the second opinion panel, who see the patients and produce their own report, are trained to help their colleagues resist the too importunate patient. Most patients have had the same GP for many years, and doctors are widely trusted. In 85% of cases, euthanasia is carried out not in nursing homes or hospitals, but by GPs in the patient's home. Patients must persist in their requests, which the criteria stipulate must be \"voluntary and well-considered\". Nico Mensing, a GP who also acts as a second opinion doctor, recalls his most difficult case. \"It was a young mother of 31 with three kids of five, three and six months. I had kids the same age. She had cancer over all her body. She suffered a lot for months and months. We talked for months about it.\" Even Rouvoet admits: \"I do have faith in our doctors and our medical system. I do not suspect any doctor of choosing easily the route of euthanasia and I'm convinced most doctors do not offer euthanasia to their patients. But when it comes up, it's a legal option and that doesn't help in encouraging investment in palliative care.\" The most controversial element of the bill, a provision allowing children of 12 and over to choose euthanasia without their parents' consent, was dropped. Children between 12 and 16 may opt for euthanasia but only with parental agreement. Those between 16 and 18 take their own decisions but parents must be involved. For the first time, the bill will allow euthanasia for patients unable to request it, if they made an advance directive - a \"living will\" - asking for it while they were still in full possession of their faculties. Most of the patients who choose euthanasia are in the final stages of cancer. But court cases over the years have established that euthanasia is not limited to cases of terminal illness, and that unbearable suffering may be psychological as well as physical. Advocates of the slippery slope argument point to the case in 1994, where a court refused to punish a psychiatrist who gave a 50-year-old former social worker suffering from pathological grief over the death of her two sons the means to kill herself. Some thought this was a case too far, though the rules stipulate that doctors must satisfy themselves that the patient's request does not stem from depression. Many, including the Royal Dutch Medical Society and the justice minister, felt the line was crossed last year when a court exonerated the doctor who helped the former senator Edward Brongersma, who had no serious physical or psychological illnesses but felt that at the age of 86 he was living \"a pointless and empty existence\", to die. The prosecuting authorities are appealing, as they have the right to do in the Netherlands. On the whole, though, more than 90% of the Dutch support euthanasia. They may wonder why so few other nations have followed their lead. One US state, Oregon, has allowed doctor-assisted suicide, but not euthanasia, for the last four years. In Australia, a law to legalise euthanasia was passed in the Northern Territory in 1995 but overturned by the Australian senate in 1997. The Netherlands' neighbour, Belgium, is only now considering a euthanasia bill. Johan Legemaate, professor of health law at Erasmus University, Rotterdam, says the Dutch system works because patients have a long-lasting relationship with a single GP, nursing home care is free so there are no economic pressures to shorten life, and the general attitude in society is to be open, not to cover up. \"If you have a country in which one or more of these elements is lacking, you should be very cautious.\"",

The change could theoretically open the way for a new trial for the men suspected of killing the black teenager Stephen Lawrence, but the adverse publicity they received would probably bar any fresh attempt to prosecute them. Jack Straw, the home secretary, asked the commission, the official law reform body for England and Wales, to look at possible changes to the ancient law of double jeopardy, which states that no one who has been convicted or acquitted of an offence can be tried a second time on the same facts. The inquiry into Stephen Lawrence's death, headed by Sir William Macpherson, recommended a review of the law, adding: \"Perhaps in modern times such absolute protection may sometimes lead to injustice.\" The commission recommends that, in murder cases only, a fresh trial should be possible if \"compelling\" new evidence of guilt emerges after the defendant is found not guilty. The change would be retrospective, applying to acquittals, such as those of three of the Lawrence suspects, which have already happened. Under current law, Neil Acourt, Luke Knight and Gary Dobson, three of the five suspects, cannot be retried because they were formally acquitted after a private prosecution launched by the Lawrence family following the crown prosecution service's decision that there was insufficient reliable evidence to prosecute. The collapse of the family's prosecution in 1996 sparked outrage when the three suspects were cleared after a judge ruled that identification evidence was unreliable. The Home Office's national crime faculty has calculated that there are currently 35 murder cases where defendants who were acquitted could be reinvestigated and new charges brought if the law is changed retrospectively. Lawyers yesterday argued that it would be unfair and oppressive to remove the ancient protection of the double jeopardy rule. Roy Amlot QC, chairman of the bar council, said: \"In principle, it cannot be right for somebody who has been acquitted to be tried again, albeit for murder.

On Saturday night, police and Ministry of Agriculture officials surrounded their farm. On Sunday foot and mouth was confirmed and yesterday the family which has farmed for four generations watched their 51 cattle and 1,000 sheep being slaughtered. Or rather they could not bear to. The carcasses will be piled high and burnt today and some time in the future the brothers will restock their silent acres. \"This has come at a terrible time, but we will not give up,\" said Michael. The Bradshaws have been through foot and mouth before when Bleak House farm was infected in 1967. Then their father saw his life work destroyed in a few hours. But for most farmers the present ordeal is new and, say professional counsellors, it will take years to recover from. Yesterday 129 farmers were effectively modern day lepers, forbidden to leave their farms, isolated from their communities and peers. A further 117 who have had confirmed cases or whose animals have had \"dangerous contact\" with confirmed cases are preparing to have animals slaughtered. The Rural Stress Network, a Christian organisation staffed largely by volunteers from within the farming industry, yesterday reported a 400% increase in distress calls since the first outbreak two weeks ago. \"People are breaking down in tears, saying it is the last straw,\" said director Caroline Davies. \"I'm in total anguish. My family and I just sit here waiting. I don't know whether this is the end or not\", said one farmer in Cumbria, next door to an infected farm.

When the two-week incubation period for the disease ends we expect the number of outbreaks start to fall.\"</p> <p>Six new cases were confirmed yesterday, compared with 13 the day before, all in areas where there had been previous outbreaks. Two were confirmed in Devon, at Hatherleigh and Highampton, two at St Weonards in Herefordshire, one at Beattock in Dumfries, and one at Bishop Auckland, Co Durham. They brought the total of confirmed cases to 74.</p> <p>\"I expect the figures to average about eight, nine or 10 [new cases] a day about now and then start to drop later in the week,\" Mr Scudamore said. There are more than 120 farms still being investigated.</p> <p>The outbreak discovered at Dunna Bridge farm on Dartmoor on Sunday, on land owned by the Prince of Wales's Duchy of Cornwall estate, was linked to other cases in Devon, the chief vet said.</p> <p>Investigations were still continuing to see if any of the 46,000 animals on common land had been infected but no decision had been made on whether any of the cattle and sheep which roam free would have to be destroyed. The ponies, which do not contract the disease, would not be killed.</p> <p>The chairman of the Devon branch of the National Farmers' Union, David Hill, suggested a ring of troops should be posted on a one-mile radius around the farm to prevent wildlife getting in and livestock getting out.</p> <p>Yesterday Prince Charles confirmed he had spoken to his tenants: \"I rang them this morning. It is an absolute nightmare .. particularly as they have spent much of their lives building up a pedigree herd.\" There are a number of suspect cases in Europe, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Germany, but none has been confirmed and some ruled out as negative. A large number of animals have been slaughtered as a precaution.</p> <p>The number of animals which have to be destroyed in Britain is still rising, creating logistical problems is getting rid of the carcasses. So far only 14,092 animals have been slaughtered out of a total of 77,614 which will be destroyed because they are infected or have dangerous contacts. The totals are 64,804 sheep, 10,894 cattle, 2,003 pigs and 13 goats.</p> <p>Mr Scudamore said contractors were being employed to build the pyres and hundreds of tons of straw, wood and coal had to be moved. Some corpses were being buried and some taken to rendering plants in sealed containers but for the majority burning in the farmers' fields was the best course. \"Fire kills the virus,\" he said.</p> <p>On Sunday in Banff, Aberdeenshire, pigs were slaughtered to supply shops for the first time since the ban on live stock movements was imposed. Licences to slaughter were issued to 170 abattoirs in England yesterday. Lorries carrying the stock have to be disinfected before loading and after delivery.</p> <p>The only other livestock being moved were in danger of drowning because of flooding but plans are being drawn up to move sheep ready for lambing down from the hills.</p> <p>The government is also reinspecting all pig farms that use swill - only about l.5% of the total. Nick Brown, the minister of agriculture, said one of the matters to be considered after the outbreak was over was whether swill feeding should be stopped altogether. Swill remains the chief suspect for how the outbreak began. To cope with the crisis the Ministry of Agriculture's 220 field vets have been augmented by 240 volunteers.</p> <p>More are coming from overseas including two from Australia, eight from the US, 10 from New Zealand, 10 from Canada and four from Ireland.</p> <p>Work has started on disinfecting abattoirs and farms affected by the disease where the animals have been destroyed. Farms can restock after 30 days, after which time the virus will have been eliminated.</p> <p>In Hereford three farmers accused of contravening foot and mouth movement restrictions by moving stock had their cases adjourned until March 22.</p> <p>\u0095 The government made no attempt to prepare for the devastating outbreak of swine fever in the pig industry last year, after a major outbreak in the Netherlands, the agriculture select committee will reveal today, writes Patrick Wintour .</p> <p>The MPs also attack the Ministry of Agriculture over a \u00a366m rescue package for the industry, announced last year, which has still not reached farmers.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>Farmer's diary</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446494,00.html\">27.02.2001: A living on the edge</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446488,00.html\">05.03.2001: Dartmoor case raises 'nightmare scenario'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446483,00.html\">05.03.2001: 'All the cheaper cuts of meat have gone'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446563,00.html\">05.03.2001: Outbreak to spare Bank's blushes</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446500,00.html\">MP hits at safety on outbreak farm</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446594,00.html\">050.03.2001: Who's mad now?

They brought the total of confirmed cases to 74. \"I expect the figures to average about eight, nine or 10 [new cases] a day about now and then start to drop later in the week,\" Mr Scudamore said. There are more than 120 farms still being investigated. The outbreak discovered at Dunna Bridge farm on Dartmoor on Sunday, on land owned by the Prince of Wales's Duchy of Cornwall estate, was linked to other cases in Devon, the chief vet said. Investigations were still continuing to see if any of the 46,000 animals on common land had been infected but no decision had been made on whether any of the cattle and sheep which roam free would have to be destroyed. The ponies, which do not contract the disease, would not be killed. The chairman of the Devon branch of the National Farmers' Union, David Hill, suggested a ring of troops should be posted on a one-mile radius around the farm to prevent wildlife getting in and livestock getting out. Yesterday Prince Charles confirmed he had spoken to his tenants: \"I rang them this morning. It is an absolute nightmare .. particularly as they have spent much of their lives building up a pedigree herd.\" There are a number of suspect cases in Europe, Italy, France, the Netherlands and Germany, but none has been confirmed and some ruled out as negative. A large number of animals have been slaughtered as a precaution. The number of animals which have to be destroyed in Britain is still rising, creating logistical problems is getting rid of the carcasses. So far only 14,092 animals have been slaughtered out of a total of 77,614 which will be destroyed because they are infected or have dangerous contacts. The totals are 64,804 sheep, 10,894 cattle, 2,003 pigs and 13 goats. Mr Scudamore said contractors were being employed to build the pyres and hundreds of tons of straw, wood and coal had to be moved. Some corpses were being buried and some taken to rendering plants in sealed containers but for the majority burning in the farmers' fields was the best course. \"Fire kills the virus,\" he said. On Sunday in Banff, Aberdeenshire, pigs were slaughtered to supply shops for the first time since the ban on live stock movements was imposed. Licences to slaughter were issued to 170 abattoirs in England yesterday. Lorries carrying the stock have to be disinfected before loading and after delivery. The only other livestock being moved were in danger of drowning because of flooding but plans are being drawn up to move sheep ready for lambing down from the hills. The government is also reinspecting all pig farms that use swill - only about l.5% of the total. Nick Brown, the minister of agriculture, said one of the matters to be considered after the outbreak was over was whether swill feeding should be stopped altogether. Swill remains the chief suspect for how the outbreak began. To cope with the crisis the Ministry of Agriculture's 220 field vets have been augmented by 240 volunteers. More are coming from overseas including two from Australia, eight from the US, 10 from New Zealand, 10 from Canada and four from Ireland. Work has started on disinfecting abattoirs and farms affected by the disease where the animals have been destroyed. Farms can restock after 30 days, after which time the virus will have been eliminated. In Hereford three farmers accused of contravening foot and mouth movement restrictions by moving stock had their cases adjourned until March 22. \u0095 The government made no attempt to prepare for the devastating outbreak of swine fever in the pig industry last year, after a major outbreak in the Netherlands, the agriculture select committee will reveal today, writes Patrick Wintour . The MPs also attack the Ministry of Agriculture over a \u00a366m rescue package for the industry, announced last year, which has still not reached farmers. What's going on?

The agriculture minister, Jean Glavany, announced the strict new security measures after tests found traces of the disease in slaughtered British sheep that had passed through nine farms in five different departments of France. Two cattle that had come into contact with some of the British sheep at a farm in Cher in central France had also shown initial symptoms of the disease and been destroyed immediately, the ministry said. The health minister, Bernard Kouchner, said \"every conceivable measure\" was being taken to ensure the disease did not gain a foothold in France, but that it would be \"a veritable miracle\" if the country was spared. Mr Glavany said it was too soon to confirm that France had been hit, noting that the initial tests on the nine potentially infected herds showed only that some animals had developed antibodies of the virus. All the animals concerned had already been slaughtered under a government decision announced last week to kill 20,000 British sheep that had been imported into France and another 30,000 French animals that had come into contact with them. All exports of animals at risk from foot and mouth disase - principally sheep, cattle, pigs and goats - have been banned for 15 days, along with the movement of susceptible live animals other than to abattoirs.

We are pleased to be progressing plans for what will still be a memorable National Hunt Festival.\" A suspected case of foot and mouth nearby, which would have put the course in an exclusion zone, proved negative. \"We will continue to monitor the foot and mouth situation very closely through the BHB and the Jockey Club,\" Gillespie added. Louis Romanet, chief executive of France Galop, said: \"They have brought in a ban on transporting horses in vans for two weeks. We can only have racing where horses are stabled at the track, which is why tomorrow's meeting at Maisons-Laffitte [the start of the French Flat season] has been cancelled.\" Talks with the agriculture ministry were planned. There was another ray of light for punters who have backed the Irish- and French-trained horses. Most bookmakers have indicated that, contrary to normal practice, they will refund stakes on those horses.",

      "bodyText": "The saga over the future of the European transfer system, which has threatened to tear football apart, was finally resolved last night after the game's world and European governing bodies, Fifa and Uefa, reached agreement with the European Commission on a new system more in line with community labour laws. The landmark agreement, which will have major implications for the future of football, was reached after a five-hour meeting in Brussels and ends six months of arduous negotiations which have caused widespread uncertainity within the game. Significantly, last night's deal on the shape of the new transfer system was reached with the support of Fifpro, the European players' union which was initially against Fifa and Uefa attempts to tie players to long contracts and punish those who unilaterally broke them. Under the new transfer system, which is expected to be in place by the start of the next football season, all contracts will be for a minimum of one year and a maximum of five. There will be one transfer window, but there will be a limited mid-season window. There will be a limit of one transfer per player per season. Players aged up to 28 will have to honour five-year contracts for a minimum of three years, and two years thereafter. Any player breaking his contract within the first two years of a three-year \"protected\" period can be barred from playing for his new club for four months in the next season and for six months should he repeat the offence.

      "body": "<p>The first thing Brian Cronie did when he arrived at the site was to sit his team down together. He has 12 staff working on the job, and his colleagues needed to be briefed on what to expect as the situation progressed. The team are used to working together - Cronie likes to use the same workers, as they know the drill and are familiar with each other's habits. But on this occasion he was conscious that some might not want to take part. \"Any person who feels they don't want to be involved is given the option to go off on another job.\" </p> <p>Cronie is safety and training director at Baldwin's, a crane operating firm. It is one of only two companies in the country with equipment large enough to lift train carriages. Last Wednesday, he was called in to the site of the Selby rail disaster. Yesterday they were lifting the last of the carriages from the mangled wreckage of the two derailed trains. </p> <p>Following last week's fatal collision, survivors, relatives and visitors to the site paid tribute to the emergency services struggling to free trapped survivors, recover bodies and secure the site. Yet fire and ambulance services are not the only ones called in to work round the clock following a major disaster. Dozens of other specialist professionals are drafted in to provide physical, emotional and psychological backup. Among the fluorescent, hard-hatted figures swarming around the site were scores of unlikely professionals whose job it is to clear up after catastrophes. </p> <p>Inspector Richard Allison of the British Transport Police says few members of the public are aware of the scale of the operation. He attempts to list every specialist currently working at the Selby site. \"Socos [scene of crime officers dealing with the pathology]; body retrieval specialists, some drafted in from the Metropolitan police; property specialists charged with gathering up every last personal effect left by passengers on the train. All those laptops, briefcases, mobile phones have to be logged, bagged and owners traced. Then there's the CID; they have to take a statement from everyone who was on that train.\" </p> <p>In addition, he cites crash in vestigators from the Health and Safety Executive, Railtrack and GNER, local council traffic controllers, family liaison officers to deal with enquiries and information from relatives, coroners liaison officers, undertakers and specialists to operate the mobile mortuaries, not to mention all the medics, firefighters and other hospital personnel. It is an enormous operation, one that requires its own support network: caterers, computer specialists manning the police Holmes system, an office manager and staff for the incident room at the site. </p> <p>\"You tend to meet the same people at every crash,\" says Cronie. \"The pathologists, the trauma people, the counsellors, some of the police specialists. That makes everybody's life easier.\" Selby is Cronie's 12th crash in the five years he has been working with Baldwin's. He says it is the worst he has seen. \"You can't help but see bodies being carried away. I'm ex-army, though, so it doesn't affect me so much - and a lot of our team have similar backgrounds.\" </p> <p>Apart from the psychological pressures, there are physical risks involved in manning the cranes. \"In the construction industry, crane operation is classified high risk and the reason for that is that cranes can turn over. We're building the big 1,000-tonne ones on site. It's like building a giant Meccano set and they require very firm, level ground to sit on. Of course, at most crash sites you don't have that, and you also don't have easy access. At Selby we have had to build before we could even get access to the track. We've got riggers out preparing the ground, and it's them that are really at risk of seeing the gory stuff.\" </p> <p>In addition, there's the problem of coordinating all the specialist beams, chains and crane parts to arrive at the site at the right time - preferably not all at once. \"It's a big job, and there are also minor things to sort out. The other afternoon I had to find a photocopy shop in Selby that could run me up a couple of colour signs that said 'No Entry: Lifting in Progress'. They gave me them for free when I told them what it was for.\" </p> <p>What runs through his mind when he hears about another crash on the news? \"You just get on with it, as I imagine the police or the fire service get on with their jobs. It is like being part of an emergency service.\" </p> <p>Hacher Tekari is the forensic officer for British Transport Police and is in charge of its laboratory. All the photographic and fingerprint evidence taken from the site will be processed by her team. \"Yes, sometimes there are distressing images coming through the lab, or you're dispatched to a site for forensic retrieval and so you're faced with certain things. We're very well trained to deal with all that though: it's part of the job.\" </p> <p>Tekari says that although forensic science sounds high-tech, the key to the job is more mundane. \"More than anything, you need to be meticulous, and have common sense, particularly with British Transport Police. When you're collecting evidence, you're not just dealing with one small area of the country. The force is nationwide.\" </p> <p>While the workers charged with clearing up after a major incident will have been trained to deal with distressing situations, on-site counselling is imperative for those who have not. CareFirst, a private counselling firm, is paid a retainer by Railtrack to be on standby to send in teams of professionals following an incident like Selby. Their teams were in place at Hatfield and Paddington, and the firm currently has 25 people working at the Selby site. \"We call it psychological first aid,\" says Jane Neal, who works for CareFirst. Before that, she did a similar job at British Airways, which took her to the Lockerbie crash site among other disaster zones. </p> <p>\"We use a treatment called diffusion technique - it's used by the American Red Cross in worldwide disaster scenarios. What we do is allow people to talk in the aftermath of trauma, let them release all the emotion they're feeling and help them to normalise the experience. Most importantly we point them in the direction of where to go for help at the next stage, and provide ongoing support, maybe for weeks afterwards.\" </p> <p>Although the service was primarily put in place to help Railtrack's employees cope in the aftermath of accidents, when there is a major incident, the counsellors are briefed to provide assistance to everyone who needs it, be they passengers, relatives, local residents or other professionals working on the clear-up operation. </p> <p>Anyone imagining that traumatised passengers receive a cosy one-to-one session would be mistaken, though. \"It works on the hoof,\" says Neal. \"There's no waiting room, unless the crash site has a longer-term incident room, like at Paddington. Generally, we walk around and just go up to people and ask them if they're OK. It might involve sitting down and having a cup of coffee. It's important to circulate, to talk to as many people as possible. Allowing someone to talk about their feelings for five minutes in these situations can be as effective as an hour's session.\" </p> <p>How do she and her colleagues cope with the stress of being on standby for major incidents themselves? \"Well, obviously we're all trained to cope, and CareFirst is very mindful of the welfare of its own employees. It isn't all major crashes either - we also work with isolated incidents, for example a train driver who has witnessed a suicide. We're also contracted by various branches of the emergency services to assist their workers.\" </p> <p>Neal is keen to stress, however, that what they are providing is not therapy. \"That wouldn't be appropriate until some time later, for those who are still not coping after a few months. We find that many people develop their own coping strategies. For our teams, going into these situations can be difficult because every major incident is different: we can't prepare a set of dos and don'ts. We work with whatever we're presented with.\" </p> <p>Until the physical and mental wounds heal, the services of healthcare professionals, counsellors and psychiatrists will continue to be in demand. The crash site, meanwhile, almost a week after the collision, is finally beginning to return to normal. Police and accident investigations will continue away from the site, and soon the track will be repaired and trains running again. And Cronie and his colleagues, and the scores of other backup personnel, will return to base and await the next call.</p>",

It is one of only two companies in the country with equipment large enough to lift train carriages. Last Wednesday, he was called in to the site of the Selby rail disaster. Yesterday they were lifting the last of the carriages from the mangled wreckage of the two derailed trains. Following last week's fatal collision, survivors, relatives and visitors to the site paid tribute to the emergency services struggling to free trapped survivors, recover bodies and secure the site. Yet fire and ambulance services are not the only ones called in to work round the clock following a major disaster. Dozens of other specialist professionals are drafted in to provide physical, emotional and psychological backup. Among the fluorescent, hard-hatted figures swarming around the site were scores of unlikely professionals whose job it is to clear up after catastrophes. Inspector Richard Allison of the British Transport Police says few members of the public are aware of the scale of the operation. He attempts to list every specialist currently working at the Selby site. \"Socos [scene of crime officers dealing with the pathology]; body retrieval specialists, some drafted in from the Metropolitan police; property specialists charged with gathering up every last personal effect left by passengers on the train. All those laptops, briefcases, mobile phones have to be logged, bagged and owners traced. Then there's the CID; they have to take a statement from everyone who was on that train.\" In addition, he cites crash in vestigators from the Health and Safety Executive, Railtrack and GNER, local council traffic controllers, family liaison officers to deal with enquiries and information from relatives, coroners liaison officers, undertakers and specialists to operate the mobile mortuaries, not to mention all the medics, firefighters and other hospital personnel. It is an enormous operation, one that requires its own support network: caterers, computer specialists manning the police Holmes system, an office manager and staff for the incident room at the site. \"You tend to meet the same people at every crash,\" says Cronie. \"The pathologists, the trauma people, the counsellors, some of the police specialists. That makes everybody's life easier.\" Selby is Cronie's 12th crash in the five years he has been working with Baldwin's. He says it is the worst he has seen. \"You can't help but see bodies being carried away. I'm ex-army, though, so it doesn't affect me so much - and a lot of our team have similar backgrounds.\" Apart from the psychological pressures, there are physical risks involved in manning the cranes. \"In the construction industry, crane operation is classified high risk and the reason for that is that cranes can turn over. We're building the big 1,000-tonne ones on site. It's like building a giant Meccano set and they require very firm, level ground to sit on. Of course, at most crash sites you don't have that, and you also don't have easy access. At Selby we have had to build before we could even get access to the track. We've got riggers out preparing the ground, and it's them that are really at risk of seeing the gory stuff.\" In addition, there's the problem of coordinating all the specialist beams, chains and crane parts to arrive at the site at the right time - preferably not all at once. \"It's a big job, and there are also minor things to sort out. The other afternoon I had to find a photocopy shop in Selby that could run me up a couple of colour signs that said 'No Entry: Lifting in Progress'. They gave me them for free when I told them what it was for.\" What runs through his mind when he hears about another crash on the news? \"You just get on with it, as I imagine the police or the fire service get on with their jobs. It is like being part of an emergency service.\" Hacher Tekari is the forensic officer for British Transport Police and is in charge of its laboratory. All the photographic and fingerprint evidence taken from the site will be processed by her team. \"Yes, sometimes there are distressing images coming through the lab, or you're dispatched to a site for forensic retrieval and so you're faced with certain things. We're very well trained to deal with all that though: it's part of the job.\" Tekari says that although forensic science sounds high-tech, the key to the job is more mundane. \"More than anything, you need to be meticulous, and have common sense, particularly with British Transport Police. When you're collecting evidence, you're not just dealing with one small area of the country. The force is nationwide.\" While the workers charged with clearing up after a major incident will have been trained to deal with distressing situations, on-site counselling is imperative for those who have not. CareFirst, a private counselling firm, is paid a retainer by Railtrack to be on standby to send in teams of professionals following an incident like Selby. Their teams were in place at Hatfield and Paddington, and the firm currently has 25 people working at the Selby site. \"We call it psychological first aid,\" says Jane Neal, who works for CareFirst. Before that, she did a similar job at British Airways, which took her to the Lockerbie crash site among other disaster zones. \"We use a treatment called diffusion technique - it's used by the American Red Cross in worldwide disaster scenarios. What we do is allow people to talk in the aftermath of trauma, let them release all the emotion they're feeling and help them to normalise the experience. Most importantly we point them in the direction of where to go for help at the next stage, and provide ongoing support, maybe for weeks afterwards.\" Although the service was primarily put in place to help Railtrack's employees cope in the aftermath of accidents, when there is a major incident, the counsellors are briefed to provide assistance to everyone who needs it, be they passengers, relatives, local residents or other professionals working on the clear-up operation. Anyone imagining that traumatised passengers receive a cosy one-to-one session would be mistaken, though. \"It works on the hoof,\" says Neal. \"There's no waiting room, unless the crash site has a longer-term incident room, like at Paddington. Generally, we walk around and just go up to people and ask them if they're OK. It might involve sitting down and having a cup of coffee. It's important to circulate, to talk to as many people as possible. Allowing someone to talk about their feelings for five minutes in these situations can be as effective as an hour's session.\" How do she and her colleagues cope with the stress of being on standby for major incidents themselves? \"Well, obviously we're all trained to cope, and CareFirst is very mindful of the welfare of its own employees. It isn't all major crashes either - we also work with isolated incidents, for example a train driver who has witnessed a suicide. We're also contracted by various branches of the emergency services to assist their workers.\" Neal is keen to stress, however, that what they are providing is not therapy. \"That wouldn't be appropriate until some time later, for those who are still not coping after a few months. We find that many people develop their own coping strategies. For our teams, going into these situations can be difficult because every major incident is different: we can't prepare a set of dos and don'ts. We work with whatever we're presented with.\" Until the physical and mental wounds heal, the services of healthcare professionals, counsellors and psychiatrists will continue to be in demand. The crash site, meanwhile, almost a week after the collision, is finally beginning to return to normal. Police and accident investigations will continue away from the site, and soon the track will be repaired and trains running again. And Cronie and his colleagues, and the scores of other backup personnel, will return to base and await the next call.",

      "body": "<p>The government yesterday promised the biggest extension of disability rights for 30 years, including legislation to protect people diagnosed with cancer and HIV from victimisation by their employers. </p> <p>Margaret Hodge, the employment minister, said she would amend the Disability Discrimination Act to strengthen protection for 600,000 already in work and cover nearly 7m jobs previously excluded from the legislation. </p> <p>They include police officers, firefighters and prison officers, but not the armed services, which are to remain exempt following a rearguard action by senior officers. </p> <p>By 2004, small businesses will be obliged to make \"reasonable adjustments\" to their premises for the benefit of disabled employees and job applicants. </p> <p>All firms will have to remove unreasonable obstacles for disabled customers. And the government will place a legal duty on public bodies to provide equal opportunities for disabled people. </p> <p>Bert Massie, chairman of the disability rights commission, said it was \"the most significant programme of reforms since disability rights legislation was first introduced 30 years ago ... Under these proposals, millions more disabled people will be protected against discrimination.\" </p> <p>Ms Hodge said the changes - recommended by a taskforce in 1999 - would give disabled people \"comprehensive and enforceable civil rights\". </p> <p>Enhanced protection for cancer sufferers was triggered by evidence that women were sacked, or selected for redundancy, while the disease was in remission and unlikely to recur.

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday promised the biggest extension of disability rights for 30 years, including legislation to protect people diagnosed with cancer and HIV from victimisation by their employers. Margaret Hodge, the employment minister, said she would amend the Disability Discrimination Act to strengthen protection for 600,000 already in work and cover nearly 7m jobs previously excluded from the legislation. They include police officers, firefighters and prison officers, but not the armed services, which are to remain exempt following a rearguard action by senior officers. By 2004, small businesses will be obliged to make \"reasonable adjustments\" to their premises for the benefit of disabled employees and job applicants. All firms will have to remove unreasonable obstacles for disabled customers. And the government will place a legal duty on public bodies to provide equal opportunities for disabled people. Bert Massie, chairman of the disability rights commission, said it was \"the most significant programme of reforms since disability rights legislation was first introduced 30 years ago ... Under these proposals, millions more disabled people will be protected against discrimination.\" Ms Hodge said the changes - recommended by a taskforce in 1999 - would give disabled people \"comprehensive and enforceable civil rights\". Enhanced protection for cancer sufferers was triggered by evidence that women were sacked, or selected for redundancy, while the disease was in remission and unlikely to recur. In one case, a woman who had recovered from a mastectomy was told to quit when she needed reconstructive surgery. Ms Hodge said: \"This is shameful. The taskforce found some employers discriminate against people diagnosed with cancer even though the cancer had no present effects, or was in remission.\" Under the new law, people's employment rights would be protected from the moment they were diagnosed as likely to require substantial treatment for cancer or HIV. They would have the same rights as those available for those diagnosed with diabetes, epilepsy or arthritis. Nick Partridge, chief executive of Terrence Higgins Trust Lighthouse, said: \"The announcement sends a clear message to employers that it is not acceptable to practise discrimination against people just because they have HIV.\" There will also be more protection for people who are blind or partially sighted, but have had difficulty qualifying as disabled. Ms Hodge said she made no compromises to win business support for the changes. \"We have persuaded employers that nobody will be asked to do anything unaffordable or beyond common sense.\" The average cost for smaller firms making their premises suitable for disabled employees would be \u00a378 per person. The CBI said the 2004 deadline for small firms was \"appropriate and realistic\". Paul Whitehouse, chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers, welcomed the extension of the act. \"It will require us to establish clearly what the requirements are to be an effective police officer.\"",

      "body": "<p>This is a great little piece of theatre. Adapted from GK Chesterton's novel, it tells the story of poet Gabriel Syme, who finds revolution revolting and, after becoming an undercover detective, infiltrates a Europe-wide secret organisation dedicated to the overthrow of society. The seven-strong ruling council take their names from the days of the week; Syme is elected to the group as Thursday. </p> <p>Attempting to foil their dastardly plans, Syme sets out on a journey during which it becomes apparent that, like him, his fellow anarchists are not always what they appear. But the question that looms largest is the identity of the elusive, terrifying Sunday. </p> <p>This surreal scenario is, in Ben Harrison's clever production, cunningly played both as tragedy and farce, with the actors called to switch between the two with stunning dexterity. One minute they are donning silly beards and disguises, the next their masks are revealed as something more sinister. </p> <p>As the story spirals to its conclusion the boundaries between dreams and reality become blurred.

      "bodyText": "This is a great little piece of theatre. Adapted from GK Chesterton's novel, it tells the story of poet Gabriel Syme, who finds revolution revolting and, after becoming an undercover detective, infiltrates a Europe-wide secret organisation dedicated to the overthrow of society. The seven-strong ruling council take their names from the days of the week; Syme is elected to the group as Thursday. Attempting to foil their dastardly plans, Syme sets out on a journey during which it becomes apparent that, like him, his fellow anarchists are not always what they appear. But the question that looms largest is the identity of the elusive, terrifying Sunday. This surreal scenario is, in Ben Harrison's clever production, cunningly played both as tragedy and farce, with the actors called to switch between the two with stunning dexterity. One minute they are donning silly beards and disguises, the next their masks are revealed as something more sinister. As the story spirals to its conclusion the boundaries between dreams and reality become blurred. Sometimes this energetic production, with its cutout trains, hot air balloons and escaping elephants, is a tad wearing, but the inventiveness of the evening is beyond doubt. And there is always something more serious going on behind the romp. The way in which the protagonists project their fears so vividly that they become a reality is as pertinent today as it was then. The suggestion is that it is not the anarchists who are the real threat, but our own paranoia. Neil Irish's atmospheric design, with its host of shadowy, sinister cutout figures, sets the tone for 90 frenzied minutes during which the audience, like Syme, has every expectation shaken up. This is small-scale theatre to be sure, but it has big ambitions. \u0095 At Aberystwyth Arts Centre tonight (01970 622882), Miskin Theatre, Darlington (01322 629472) March 14 and touring until March 24.
