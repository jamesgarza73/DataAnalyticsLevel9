Educated at a convent in Norway, she and her mother returned to England in 1936, where, having changed her name to Gynt after Ibsen's Peer Gynt, she got a few small stage parts.

The Spanish side will be acutely aware that an away goal would give them every chance of overturning the deficit at home. 45 Rivaldo, tucked in just over half-way line, continues to take on the Chelsea defence and feed balls into the area, but nothing goes. Half-time. 46 Substitution Litmanen on for Puyol. Chelsea show no signs of letting up on the tempo of the first half. 47 Booking Zola, for diving over the legs of De Boer in the Barcelona area. 50 Booking Cocu, for clattering into the face of Morris. No clear chances for either side so far. Chelsea, not surprisingly, decide to sit back for a few minutes and soak up the pressure. 53 Barcelona keen to spread the ball wide for Figo on the right rather than rely so heavily on Rivaldo going through the middle. 54 Wise gets away from Figo and releases Zola on the left. The Italian is tackled just outside the area but wisely refuses to go down for what looked like a foul. 55 Figo continuing to probe ever wider on the right in his search for space and the perfect crossing position. 61 Kluivert gets away from Desailly just outside the Chelsea area as Rivaldo attempts to play him in from the left, but Desailly recovers to clear. 63 Barcelona win a corner on the left and Kluivert gets up well on the edge of the six-yard box but his header fails to find the net. 64 Goal: Chelsea 3 - 1 Barcelona Barcelona get the vital away goal. Figo drops back into midfield and with a short pass finds Rivaldo, who in turn spreads the ball wide to Cocu. Figo, continuing his run, picks up the return almost immediately and slots the ball past De Goey at the far post with apparent ease. Some whimpers of applause from the crowd. 68 Chelsea starting to look at little ragged as Barcelona take control with some neat passing. 70 Dodgy moment for Chelsea as Rivaldo and Figo combine again to release Kluivert on the right edge of the area - his shot is wide. 71 A Rivaldo rocket shot from all of 30 yards has De Goey fumbling on the ground, but Thome is on hand to clear. 72 Substitutions Di Matteo on for Petrescu, Dani on for Kluivert. 74 Flo, on a hat-trick, gets away on the right and beats Abelardo with ease, but the Norwegian loses fluffs it and skews his shot yards wide of the far post. 76 Figo moves out to the right again and fires in a cross to Dani, alone in the six-yard box bar three Chelsea defenders. Dani beaten by shear numbers. 78 Chelsea win a corner. Wise takes from the left and plays it short to Zola. He gets away to the byline but his cross fails to find anyone. 82 Zola takes a free-kick from wide on the left, but the ball falls into what must have been the only space in the six-yard box and Barcelona clear. Barcelona immediately counter with a break. Figo charges off through the middle, passes to Gabri on the overlap, picks up the return and then makes a complete mess of his shot by spooning the ball into the crowd. 87 Substitution Sutton on for Flo. 88 Wise concedes a free-kick 40 yards out; Rivaldo takes, but drills it against the wall. 89 Some sharp one-touch passing by Di Matteo, Sutton and Morris in midfield ends with Zola running into space on the right near the byline, but he is unable to get in a shot and puts behind. 90 Three minutes of extra time to play. The game finally appears to have hit a low point as the Stamford Bridge faithful warm up for a celebration. The last chance falls to Barcelona when Rivaldo whips in a cross to Dani, but his effort fails to test De Goey. Full-time. Chelsea 3 - 1 Barcelona. Top result for Chelsea, but Barcelona will fancy themselves to get the required result in two weeks' time.",

When you're hitching a lift with dubious characters in the Outback, you learn how to handle people. You learn patience and the fact that you can have bad days even when you are doing exactly what you want. When I had my first interview for a career job after travelling, I was asked if I would go away again and said yes. I got the job because my boss thought I could achieve in six months what would take other people years. Everyone else had asked about the perks, while I asked about the potentials of the business.

I had planned just to travel but ended up teaching English in a refugee camp for eight months. When I came back, I did voluntary work to get back into the swing of things. When I finally went for an interview for a career job, I made sure that the panel knew what kind of travelling I had done. I pointed out that I had worked, that I had gone for a \"life experience\" and that I had thrown myself into the country's culture. The person who interviewed me had never travelled, and he could easily have presumed that I'd just been dossing around for a year. A lot of people go away just to get smashed every night, so it was important that I pointed out I hadn't just been a backpacker. </p> <p> <strong> Caroline Larsson, 38</strong> solicitor </p> <p> Travelling literally changes your life and you've got to assess before you leave how it will affect your career. I gave up my job in the City as a solicitor with no illusions that I was closing a few doors, but when I came back I was still surprised by snooty attitudes. Several city agencies said they couldn't help me because I'd taken time out and that travelling was \"unacceptable\". I did a management course for graduates which got my feet back on the ground and used my contacts in law. I thought about what I really wanted to do, decided on Legal Aid work and got a job through a friend after five months. I get a lot more job satisfaction now and don't regret a thing. </p> <p> <strong> Anthony Jeffries, 36</strong> production manager </p> <p> When I started work I applied to large organisations as I wanted to travel. I've been away three times and when I came back the third time I saw my last job advertised, applied and got it. If you are enthusiastic and good at your job, and if you give your bosses plenty of notice before you leave, they are more likely to offer you a position when you come back. You can't work your way up a firm as quickly, but the alternative is lying on your CV, which is never a good idea. </p> <p> <strong> Jenny Adams, 29</strong> PR consultant </p> <p> I've gone travelling twice, and the first time I came back I took a high-powered job which I hated. I was working with people who had never travelled and seemed small-minded, and after six months I went away again. When I came back the second time I thought really hard about my mindset. I felt creative and inspired so applied for a job in arts PR. I didn't have much experience but got the job. Much later, I asked my boss why she'd employed me. She said it was because I'd typed my CV on yellow paper and wore a bright-coloured shirt! I suppose I was enthusiastic and willing to stick my neck out. I love my job, and think that risk-taking mindset you get when you come back from travelling is worth exploiting. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Pity the poor fat cats at the BBC. While most of the embattled corporation's 22,000 workers have greeted the arrival of new director general Greg Dyke like a long lost son, the 11 members of the Beeb's executive committee may be feeling less enthusiastic. This week, they learned that their entitlement to a chauffeur-driven car to work is to end. (They may be allowed to keep the additional company car they are given for personal use, but only \"on basis of need\".) It's all very well giving extra money for new programmes, but how's a chap to get in from Banbury in the mornings? </p> <p>Dyke may be directing millions at programme-making and slashing the Beeb's notoriously bloated strategy department, but it is the top brass losing their chauffeurs that has cornered the headlines. There is something in the image of a fat cat brought low - preferably reduced to strap-hanging on the Victoria line - to raise a cheer from anyone whose daily journey is spent with their face in someone else's armpit. New boy Dyke, nothing if not a populist, wants to give us what we like. \"It won't save much money in the scheme of things,\" he conceded, \"but it is an important issue in terms of the way it looks.\" Whether the DG's concern for appearances extends to sacrificing his own chauffeur-driven Jaguar remains to be seen. </p> <p>It is perhaps surprising that Dyke's predecessor John Birt (chauffeur-driven Rover, wife behind the wheel of a BBC-funded 4x4) didn't recognise his vulnerability to unfavourable press in failing to display similar restraint. It's all very well for top dogs at billion-pound operations in the City to demand chauffeurs as part of their package. \"Everyone from chairmen and vice presidents to bankers, lawyers and investors,\" does it, according to international chauffeuring firm Brunel Carriages. But public servants can't very well be seen to be ferrying their staff around in Rollers with uniformed lackeys scuttling to open doors and doff caps at every turn. Just ask John Prescott. It doesn't matter how good you may be at your work - or indeed whether your job is the second most important in the country - how many vehicles you need to get there is crucial if you want to at least appear to be in touch with your roots. </p> <p>Enter Ken Livingstone, official Man of the People. Despite recently being outed as a man of substantial means thanks to his extra-curricular speaking engagements, Livingstone insists on taking the Tube at every opportunity, preferably with a photographer in tow. If he is elected mayor, he says, neither he nor any GLA members will have access to chauffeur-driven vehicles or even a pool of cars. \"Nobody in London would pay any attention to the Mayor droning on about using public transport if they are being swished around in a chauffeur-driven car,\" he has said. </p> <p>Similarly, we don't any longer hear Steven Norris talking about the \"dreadful human beings\" he has to sit beside on trains, as he did to the commons select committee on the environment, now he is himself seeking election. Public transport is now, if not to be embraced, at least to be supported publicly at every opportunity, even if that means having to use it from time to time. Martin McGuinness made a point of declining the chauffeur-driven car to which he was entitled while (briefly) minister for education in the Northern Irish assembly. And first for the chop under Neil Kinnock's reforms of the \"gravy train\" European parliament? Free travel and chauffeur-driven cars. </p> <p>It's a tough job driving toffs around when they decide they want to show restraint. Being a chauffeur is a profession akin to sword swallowing at a time of corporate cutbacks - the smallest movement from above is likely to mean the chop. \"Chauffeurs are always the first people to be made redundant when a company decides to slim down,\" says Katherine Shields, manager of Staff of Distinction, an international domestic staff agency specialising in chauffeurs. She currently has 500 chauffeurs on her books looking for positions with a corporate or private client. And the number of employers currently seeking drivers? \"Um, around five.\" </p> <p>The number of chauffeurs kicking their heels while waiting for work may be a surprise, since it is not a job many would envy. \"You need to have an understanding wife,\" concedes Shields. \"I'm never interested in candidates who say they are not prepared to be flexible.\" Her definition of flexibility? \"You might pick up a company chairman from an address in Buckinghamshire or Hertfordshire at 5.30am, drive the directors to meetings or lunch appointments during the day, and then drive the chairman home again in the evening. There can be a lot of hanging around, which many people wouldn't like. You can drop your client off to a business meeting or a business lunch and then have to wait two, three, four hours.\" </p> <p>The company also supplies \"handymen-chauffeurs\" to private clients, who may be called on to do odd jobs around the house during the day. \"They would maybe run the wife to Peter Jones and take the kids to school and pick them up again.\" A posh version of the school run, in other words, but in a peaked cap. </p> <p>Despite the long hours and silly threads, however, there is no shortage of those wanting to sign up for the job. Rolls Royce/Bentley has run a chauffeur instruction school for half a century, and there is currently a five-month waiting list for the \u00a31,000 course. \"There is certainly still a need for them,\" says Steve Tomlinson, the course trainer. \"The main reason nowadays that people have chauffeurs is so they can conduct their business on the way to work. I would guess 60% of the work done by some people in London is done in the back of a car on the way to meetings. Rolls Royce cars are almost like mini-offices, you can hold meetings in the back of our cars.\" </p> <p>Which almost makes a fat cat's chauffeur, if not his best friend, perhaps his PA. \"It's crucial you get on,\" says Shields. \"You spend a lot of time with this person. One candidate became so close to his employer, he was given his Mercedes when his boss was relocated to the US. They have to have a special relationship.\" Very generous, although it pales compared to the gesture of Steven Norris, who valued his government chauffeur so much he hired him when he lost his post in 1997 and put him in charge of the company fleet in his new role at the Road Haulage Association. More recently he has described his former chauffeur as his \"right-hand man\" in his campaign to be mayor. </p> <p>So pity the poor fat cats of the BBC. Not only reduced to scanning the timetables of Thames Trains, but suddenly bereft of their most reliable, deferential and discreet companions. No doubt the remaining 22,000 at the Beeb, not to mention the nation's licence-payers, will weep for them.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates, who led the company's efforts to reach a settlement with the government in its anti-monopolies trial, returned to the attack yesterday. </p> <p>In comments made after Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that the world's largest software company had broken anti-monopolies laws, Mr Gates said that the ruling would not lead to a break-up of the company. </p> <p>\"I don't think any kind of extreme remedy such as a break-up is at all consistent with what the court put forward,\" he said. \"Common sense stands on our side.\" </p> <p>Mr Gates, who stood down from the day-to-day running of the business in January, has made few forthright comments on the case since the judge delivered his first negative ruling in November. But since settlement talks broke down over the weekend and the judge delivered his almost entirely negative verdict on Monday, Mr Gates has turned to criticising the government's position. </p> <p>\"The principle at the centre of this case is very important for the economy. The lack of [government] regulation of the software industry has been key to its success to date,\" he said. </p> <p>This argument flies in the face of the verdict handed out by Judge Jackson. In his historic decision, the judge found that Microsoft violated the law by using anti-competitive means to maintain its stranglehold on the personal computer industry and to prevent competition in the fledgling internet browser market. </p> <p>The European commission has stepped up its own investigation into Microsoft and the ruling has given sustenance to more than 100 private lawsuits already filed against the company in the US. </p> <p>Wall Street analysts, most of whom are still supportive of Microsoft, yesterday suggested that the uncertainty would continue to hit the group's share price. </p> <p>After falling 15% on Monday, the company's shares were down a further $2 yesterday at about $88 as the technology sector continued to be hit by falling confidence. The Seattle-based company has already said that it will appeal against the eventual remedy decreed by Judge Jackson. </p> <p>Even the expedited appeal asked for by the company is likely to take six to 12 months. During such time, the company expects the software market to change even more significantly. </p> <p>Brad Smith, a senior lawyer for the company, said after the ruling: \"At bottom, this is a case about our decision to integrate the internet into Windows.\" </p> <p>He indicated that all software would soon include an ability to link to the internet. </p> <p>Andrew Roskill, industry analyst at Warburg Dillon Read, the investment bank, agrees with Microsoft. \"The whole case has been ridiculously moot,\" he said. \"The entire market has already changed.\" </p> <p>But the judge has ruled that Microsoft's bundling of its browser with Windows, which is used on more than 90% of the world's personal computers, broke laws designed to curb monopolistic power. </p> <p>In spite of this week's bravado, Microsoft executives do admit to having made mistakes. Mr Smith said on Monday night: \"We have already learned a lot - about our responsibility as a corporate citizen, about our responsibility as a business partner.\"</p>",

In comments made after Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that the world's largest software company had broken anti-monopolies laws, Mr Gates said that the ruling would not lead to a break-up of the company. \"I don't think any kind of extreme remedy such as a break-up is at all consistent with what the court put forward,\" he said. \"Common sense stands on our side.\" Mr Gates, who stood down from the day-to-day running of the business in January, has made few forthright comments on the case since the judge delivered his first negative ruling in November. But since settlement talks broke down over the weekend and the judge delivered his almost entirely negative verdict on Monday, Mr Gates has turned to criticising the government's position. \"The principle at the centre of this case is very important for the economy. The lack of [government] regulation of the software industry has been key to its success to date,\" he said. This argument flies in the face of the verdict handed out by Judge Jackson. In his historic decision, the judge found that Microsoft violated the law by using anti-competitive means to maintain its stranglehold on the personal computer industry and to prevent competition in the fledgling internet browser market. The European commission has stepped up its own investigation into Microsoft and the ruling has given sustenance to more than 100 private lawsuits already filed against the company in the US. Wall Street analysts, most of whom are still supportive of Microsoft, yesterday suggested that the uncertainty would continue to hit the group's share price. After falling 15% on Monday, the company's shares were down a further $2 yesterday at about $88 as the technology sector continued to be hit by falling confidence. The Seattle-based company has already said that it will appeal against the eventual remedy decreed by Judge Jackson. Even the expedited appeal asked for by the company is likely to take six to 12 months. During such time, the company expects the software market to change even more significantly. Brad Smith, a senior lawyer for the company, said after the ruling: \"At bottom, this is a case about our decision to integrate the internet into Windows.\" He indicated that all software would soon include an ability to link to the internet. Andrew Roskill, industry analyst at Warburg Dillon Read, the investment bank, agrees with Microsoft. \"The whole case has been ridiculously moot,\" he said. \"The entire market has already changed.\" But the judge has ruled that Microsoft's bundling of its browser with Windows, which is used on more than 90% of the world's personal computers, broke laws designed to curb monopolistic power. In spite of this week's bravado, Microsoft executives do admit to having made mistakes. Mr Smith said on Monday night: \"We have already learned a lot - about our responsibility as a corporate citizen, about our responsibility as a business partner.\"",

      "bodyText": "The row over rural banks intensified last night as the government's strategy to save rural communities from mass closures was heavily criticised in an internal Post Office paper that accused ministers of using bogus figures to justify closing down smaller post offices. Meanwhile, Barclays Bank hit back at the environment minister Chris Mullin for his \"irresponsible\" behaviour in advocating a boycott in protest at its plans to close 172 rural outlets. Ministerial colleagues moved quickly to distance themselves from Mr Mullin's remarks, revealed in yesterday's Guardian. A spokeswoman for Barclays said it was \"extremely disappointing\" for a member of the government to have made such comments. But Mr Mullin won backing last night from his ministerial colleague Lord Whitty, who told the House of Lords: \"It is of course open to customers of Barclays who are disgruntled by what seems to be a bit of a cavalier disregard of rural interests to change their bankers.\" The Conservative leader, William Hague, aware that bank and post office closures are a huge political issue in the countryside, condemned the Barclays plan as outrageous - but he also criticised Mr Mullin for urging a boycott, saying that it was a futile call since millions of customers would ignore it.

The memo reveals that the Post Office is privately pressing the government to delay the introduction of automated benefit payments into bank accounts, a move estimated to deprive some local post offices of more than 50% of their income. The memo, dated March 3 and written for Stuart Sweetman, the Post Office's group managing director for customer and banking services, challenges the government's presentation of the savings to be made by moving to automated credit transfer (ACT).

We have to go forward and put them under as much pressure as we can.\" </p> <p>Such an approach would suit United, whose game is based on swift counter-attacks.

      "body": "<p>Poor Dean Holdsworth. One has to feel sorry for the man. Ever since the Bolton striker left Griffin Park embarrassment has followed doggedly in his footsteps like a wolf trailing a wounded caribou. </p> <p>Kiss-and-tell revelations in the tabloids, his wife Samantha singing You're So Vain on television and now that Wembley miss.There is a grain of comfort for Holdsworth, however. Fame is said to be a fickle mistress which perhaps explains why she sometimes tells the victor she has a headache and invites the defeated into her boudoir instead. </p> <p>Sunday's high-profile mistake could see the unhappy Wanderer getting just such an unexpected call and joining that select band of sportsmen and women who have achieved immortality through error. </p> <p>People such as Scott Norwood of the Buffalo Bills whose last-second field goal attempt in the 1991 Super Bowl drifted wide, ensuring that his name would live on long after those of many of the winning New York Giants have faded from memory, or the French golfer Jan van de Velde whose camel-like instinct for finding water during last year's British Open raised his public profile more dramatically than any amount of solid performances on the European circuit. </p> <p>As he leafs through the match analysis of Sunday's game the former Wimbledon forward's consolation must be that, while practically everyone in Britain has heard of Devon Loch, only a few can remember the name of the horse that beat him. </p> <p>Not that any old case of abject bungling is enough to bring sporting renown. If it was, the pantheon of immortals would be as chock-full of names as Mike Reed's notebook. </p> <p> Milan's Daniele Massaro, for example, conclusively proved the importance of supply and demand in the equation with his performance against Marseille in the 1993 European Cup final. Paying the price for wearing silly-coloured boots, the Italian striker produced a cluster of the worst misses seen in one place since the closure of St Trinian's. Anyone of them might have had Massaro spoken of in the same hushed tones as Geoff Thomas. Their ubiquity, however, left them tragically devalued. </p> <p>As Holdsworth relives the moment when his stiff-legged swish sent the ball arcing over the Aston Villa bar, he should occasionally mutter the name \"Gordon Smith\" to himself. Smith, as hardly anybody will need reminding, was the Brighton forward whose botching of an easy chance in the last minute of extra-time in the 1983 FA Cup final cost the Seagulls victory over Manchester United. That the Scotsman had put his side ahead in the first half of the match, played in six cup finals with Rangers and scored the winner for them against Celtic in the Scottish League Cup final of 1978 are high points overshadowed by that monumental miss. </p> <p>He might think too of Wakefield Trinity's goal-kicking prop Don Fox. The 1968 rugby league Challenge Cup final between Trinity and Leeds took place on a Wembley pitch that so resembled a paddy field the two teams played in constant fear of slips and handling errors. </p> <p>In the dying moments, with Leeds leading 11-7, Ken Hirst touched down for Wakefield to bring it back to 11-10 and give Fox the glory of winning the game with his conversion. The kick from straight in front of the posts looked simple but Fox sliced it. \"He must wish the ground would swallow him up,\" Eddie Waring intoned after watching the kicker fall flat on his face with a splash afterwards. Instead time has raised Fox on to a pedestal. Sometimes in sport nothing succeeds like a mess.</p>",

Kiss-and-tell revelations in the tabloids, his wife Samantha singing You're So Vain on television and now that Wembley miss.There is a grain of comfort for Holdsworth, however. Fame is said to be a fickle mistress which perhaps explains why she sometimes tells the victor she has a headache and invites the defeated into her boudoir instead. Sunday's high-profile mistake could see the unhappy Wanderer getting just such an unexpected call and joining that select band of sportsmen and women who have achieved immortality through error. People such as Scott Norwood of the Buffalo Bills whose last-second field goal attempt in the 1991 Super Bowl drifted wide, ensuring that his name would live on long after those of many of the winning New York Giants have faded from memory, or the French golfer Jan van de Velde whose camel-like instinct for finding water during last year's British Open raised his public profile more dramatically than any amount of solid performances on the European circuit. As he leafs through the match analysis of Sunday's game the former Wimbledon forward's consolation must be that, while practically everyone in Britain has heard of Devon Loch, only a few can remember the name of the horse that beat him. Not that any old case of abject bungling is enough to bring sporting renown. If it was, the pantheon of immortals would be as chock-full of names as Mike Reed's notebook. Milan's Daniele Massaro, for example, conclusively proved the importance of supply and demand in the equation with his performance against Marseille in the 1993 European Cup final. Paying the price for wearing silly-coloured boots, the Italian striker produced a cluster of the worst misses seen in one place since the closure of St Trinian's. Anyone of them might have had Massaro spoken of in the same hushed tones as Geoff Thomas. Their ubiquity, however, left them tragically devalued. As Holdsworth relives the moment when his stiff-legged swish sent the ball arcing over the Aston Villa bar, he should occasionally mutter the name \"Gordon Smith\" to himself. Smith, as hardly anybody will need reminding, was the Brighton forward whose botching of an easy chance in the last minute of extra-time in the 1983 FA Cup final cost the Seagulls victory over Manchester United. That the Scotsman had put his side ahead in the first half of the match, played in six cup finals with Rangers and scored the winner for them against Celtic in the Scottish League Cup final of 1978 are high points overshadowed by that monumental miss. He might think too of Wakefield Trinity's goal-kicking prop Don Fox. The 1968 rugby league Challenge Cup final between Trinity and Leeds took place on a Wembley pitch that so resembled a paddy field the two teams played in constant fear of slips and handling errors. In the dying moments, with Leeds leading 11-7, Ken Hirst touched down for Wakefield to bring it back to 11-10 and give Fox the glory of winning the game with his conversion. The kick from straight in front of the posts looked simple but Fox sliced it. \"He must wish the ground would swallow him up,\" Eddie Waring intoned after watching the kicker fall flat on his face with a splash afterwards. Instead time has raised Fox on to a pedestal. Sometimes in sport nothing succeeds like a mess.",

But at this moment I'm just aiming to do well for Real Madrid and that's what I care about.\" He also makes an effort to get on with the right people and is on good terms with the coach Vicente del Bosque at a club he joined on a Bosman at a rate of \u00a354,000 a week but who, he knows, may cash in on their windfall at any moment. Jose Felix Diaz of Marca sees it thus. \"More was expected of him when he was signed and he took a long time to appear because of the injury. But he's gradually finding his way. If he picks up a bit, he should be around for a while more. \"The problem is that Madrid have had such a difficult season that, unless they win the Champions League, they will be looking for scapegoats.\"",

      "body": "<p>The story of how Frank Dobson was transformed almost overnight, after decades of useful and well-meaning public service, into British politics' most hilarious clown is a tragic one, and soon after the election on May 4, when the poor old sap is heading disconsolately for the Lords or the chairmanship of a quango, someone must write the article marking it as such. Someone, but not me. There are peaks of hypocrisy which even the newspaper columnist must not attempt to scale.</p> <p>Since the beginning of his mayoral campaign last autumn, the Guardian Diary has teased Dobbo (or tormented him, as he might put it) with all the lack of mercy due a placeman of Tony Blair's in a rampantly rigged election.

      "bodyText": "The story of how Frank Dobson was transformed almost overnight, after decades of useful and well-meaning public service, into British politics' most hilarious clown is a tragic one, and soon after the election on May 4, when the poor old sap is heading disconsolately for the Lords or the chairmanship of a quango, someone must write the article marking it as such. Someone, but not me. There are peaks of hypocrisy which even the newspaper columnist must not attempt to scale. Since the beginning of his mayoral campaign last autumn, the Guardian Diary has teased Dobbo (or tormented him, as he might put it) with all the lack of mercy due a placeman of Tony Blair's in a rampantly rigged election. It has not, in all truth, been a difficult job, the tone of buffoonery being set from the very start, with Dobbo announcing his entry into the race three weeks after stating on record that he would never run for mayor. From that moment forth, thanks entirely to its readers' fervour in reporting these things and not one iota to journalistic skill, the Diary led the way on such memorable early cock-ups as the failure to get permission to use the membership lists - \"You amaze me!\", said Dobbo, when Panorama's John Ware told him the Data Protection Registrar had received no application from him - and the sending of identical \"Dear Friend, Vote Dobbo\" letters by a dozen London MPs. When news emerged that Frank was a little down, we inaugurated the Cheer Up Dobbo! campaign, first with a series of vulgar jokes (\"Frank's Chuckle\") of the kind he is so fond of; and then, more dramatically, with a circus-style show involving jugglers, stilt-walkers and fire-throwers outside his HQ in Camden. A day after this event, a letter of rebuke marked \"for publication\" arrived from the campaign, pointing out that Frank missed the performance because he was visiting a sick child at the nearby Great Ormond Street hospital ... an ill-judged attempt to make political capital out of human suffering which, like so much else, swiftly backfired. A call to the hospital elicited amazement from a press officer, who had thought that the visit was strictly private, and had received no request to make it public.

Parents start sending their children back to school.\"</p> <p>There is a \"tremendous sense of guilt\" among the professional class, she adds. \"They are not able to provide their children with the kind of education they had, and feel helpless to do anything about it.\"</p> <p>Today, life-long education is needed to keep abreast of changes in science and technology, and the sanctions have had a devastating effect on fields such as medical science. An AFSC medical delegation which visited Iraq in May last year reported: \"Iraqi doctors got their first taste of the intellectual boycott when delivery of their own medical journals and those in their hospital libraries abruptly stopped at the time of the Gulf war.\"</p> <p>The US post office manual states: \"Due to United States government sanctions, mail pieces sent to Iraq may contain only personal communications\". But it is hard to see what threatening military use could be made of some of the categories which have been suspended, such as sheet music.</p> <p>AFSC applied to the UN last summer for permission to send medical journals to Iraq. The request was routed first to the US treasury and then the state department, and AFSC has only just received the green light. It has now launched a campaign against the \"intellectual embargo\" of Iraq, seeking funds to send the 15 subscriptions to Iraq's 10 medical schools via Jordan.</p> <p>Ms Rao Singh says: \"Iraq can still manage because it has extremely qualified professionals, but most are in their mid-30s and above. So where are the human resources going to come from in 10 years time?\"</p>",

Parents start sending their children back to school.\" There is a \"tremendous sense of guilt\" among the professional class, she adds. \"They are not able to provide their children with the kind of education they had, and feel helpless to do anything about it.\" Today, life-long education is needed to keep abreast of changes in science and technology, and the sanctions have had a devastating effect on fields such as medical science. An AFSC medical delegation which visited Iraq in May last year reported: \"Iraqi doctors got their first taste of the intellectual boycott when delivery of their own medical journals and those in their hospital libraries abruptly stopped at the time of the Gulf war.\" The US post office manual states: \"Due to United States government sanctions, mail pieces sent to Iraq may contain only personal communications\". But it is hard to see what threatening military use could be made of some of the categories which have been suspended, such as sheet music. AFSC applied to the UN last summer for permission to send medical journals to Iraq. The request was routed first to the US treasury and then the state department, and AFSC has only just received the green light. It has now launched a campaign against the \"intellectual embargo\" of Iraq, seeking funds to send the 15 subscriptions to Iraq's 10 medical schools via Jordan. Ms Rao Singh says: \"Iraq can still manage because it has extremely qualified professionals, but most are in their mid-30s and above. So where are the human resources going to come from in 10 years time?\"",

Another group of heroic teachers is at the centre of a quiet revolution emerging in parts of Angola. Adra is a local organisation of former teachers who are horrified by education's loss of prestige since the early years after independence. \"When a soba (chief) explains that people do not want to send their children to school because they see that those who go become politicians or businessmen and are thieves and liars, you know you have got a really fundamental need for change in style, in content and in perception of education,\" said a leader of Adra. The scale of the changes needed would deter most people, but Adra's leaders have come through the tradition of struggle of the ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), and are used to working long term in rural communities for apparently modest gains. The organisation's president is Fernando Pacheco, an agricultural economist and former MPLA official. One of the group's founders was Lopo de Nascimento, a former prime minister, then secretary-general of the MPLA. In one of the world's most rigid government systems, such high profile political backing was essential to starting what has become an unofficial support system for government education and an example of what can be changed. Adra works in three autonomous groups in Benguela, parts of Luanda, and Malange, a city in the north which held out against Unita sieges for months, helping local communities to be self-sufficient with civic education and seminars on rights and justice. The groups help communities - most often of displaced people - to organise agricultural projects, run seminars for teachers, organise the community, build new classrooms or upgrade old ones, and give land to the teachers to grow food to supplement their wages. A displaced community outside the coastal town of Catumbela provides an illustration of what can be achieved. A disused sugar plantation is now the site of thriving communal maize plots. A $2,000 maize-grinding mill started with micro-credit from Adra was so successful that the money was repaid within 18 months. Women and children laugh as they swim in the irrigation canal. Two schools, the Patrice Lumumba primary school and the People's United school in the centre of Catumbela, have the typical atmosphere of Adra-supported schools. The classrooms are freshly painted and a new health post has been built by parents. More importantly, every teacher talks about how Adra's monthly seminars with teachers, parents and government officials have meant an end to the feeling of being isolated in an underpaid job, with no real interest from parents or teachers. \"We are in a network now and I believe we can do anything in this school and all our children have a different chance now,\" said one young teacher.

Basically, it sucks the joy out of most things that make life worth living - food, sex, relationships and achievements. They no longer make sense as something which would prompt an emotional response. It's emotional dyslexia, if you like. You know what the occasion is; you just can't rise to it. </p> <p>My own depression came with a variety of symptoms, few of which could be measured effectively and most of which have shifted and changed as the condition has become chronic. It's an illness which other people can't see, and unless they've experienced it first hand they sometimes view a sufferer as not helping themselves, as becoming a \"victim of their own misery\" and basically not even trying. Plenty of well-meaning people have said this to me in so many words and I can remember, to my shame, that I once said it myself to a depressed friend. </p> <p>At the time I couldn't understand why she wouldn't just drop it; if she couldn't get a life at least she could try a hobby to help her get a grip. Now I know - when I am at my lowest, I couldn't \"drop\" my depression if the pope asked nicely, and I could no sooner get a grip than fly. </p> <p>Depression can be triggered by specific life events, a physical illness, or a chemical imbalance in the brain. It seems likely that my present onset was prompted by a series of common disasters mugging me. My depression can be devastating. It can take every ounce of energy I have just to sit still; it requires every bit of spirit I possess to do anything. Anhedonia leaves me impassive and joyless. My responses become shallow and mechanical and I'm left feeling completely isolated and adrift from the world. </p> <p>Even now that I'm better able to manage my symptoms, I still have to listen to other people's reactions to my achievements before my autopilot kicks in and I can at least appear more convincingly pleased. </p> <p>There are people who just don't believe in depression. It's a subjective issue, of course, and with no visual aids and only the word of sufferers, it's hardly surprising. </p> <p>There is hope, however. Dr Tonmay Sharma, a consultant psychiatrist at the Institute of Psychiatry in London, heads a team presently investigating the organic nature of depressive illness by conducting a study into anhedonia and depression through brain imaging. Functional magnetic resonance imaging - fMRI - has given researchers the opportunity to visualise the effects of depression on the brain. </p> <p>His findings suggest that a tangible change occurs in the hippo- campus (an area of the brain which deals with emotion): it's often smaller in people with depression and anhedonia. Lesions and changes in brain metabolism have also been noted. </p> <p>Dr Sharma's study has shown that the network which modulates mood in the brain of an anhedonia sufferer shows no activity when presented with pleasing or positive images, whereas in the brain of a person with no anhedonic symptoms such stimulation causes the network to light up. </p> <p>\"This is a crucial juncture in research into depression. The emergence of new technology is allowing us to map the brain,\" says Sharma. \"We can now work together with patients to learn more about the condition and find appropriate psychological or pharmacological treatments.\" </p> <p>The team is hoping that being able to show physical evidence in the brain will also encourage depression and anhedonia sufferers to obtain treatment earlier.

Sharma and his team also hope to investigate how treating anhedonia affects the make-up of the brain, again using fMRI. Sharma sees this study as an important part of the campaign against stigma being waged by the Institute of Psychiatry, as well as an exciting breakthrough in understanding the illness. </p> <p>Enjoyment is a basic requirement for a full and happy life.

More than three years after the death of their adopted daughter, Lucy, ripples of pain still lie just below the surface. </p> <p>After the bleak days of grief, guilt, and severe marital strain, Carol and Neil might now be expected to try to put the past behind them. Instead, having survived every parent's worst nightmare, they have chosen to plunge themselves into it again - by fostering a one-year-old boy who stands only a slim chance of surviving to adulthood. </p> <p>\"A lot of people probably think we're mad, and I can understand that,\" says Carol. \"But there are terminally-ill children spending the whole of their lives in institutions because their families can't cope with the strain. After all we learned with Lucy, it would seem a waste not to help make another short life a happier one.\" The Wilkinsons, both 49, show no sign of masochism, missionary zeal, or obsession with glory - they seem quite simply besotted with children. They have four of their own, an adopted daughter, and have fostered more than 100 others since 1976. </p> <p>The motivation to foster initially came from Neil. Now a principal engineer at Jaguar, he was put into care twice as a child - less-than-happy experiences which left him determined to provide a better environment for children in similar situations. </p> <p>The couple had no experience of dealing with so-called \"life-limited children\" until 13 years ago, when Coventry social services asked them to foster a baby called Lucy, then only 12 weeks old, who was expected to die within three months. In the end, Lucy defeated this prognosis and many more. She survived for a decade, becoming emotionally and legally - through adoption - a central part of the Wilkinson family. </p> <p>She had been healthy at birth, but a day later \"died\" a cot death. She was revived, but left with severe cerebral palsy, epilepsy, asthma and, says Carol, \"virtually everything else in the book\". </p> <p>\"We had no real experience of dealing with serious sickness, and at the start we were only told that she had difficulty feeding,\" says Carol. \"If we'd known then how long she would live, and how badly disabled she was, we probably wouldn't have accepted her.\" </p> <p>The memories of caring for such a deeply damaged child are still vivid. \"At first, Lucy was in constant pain and screamed 24 hours a day. It wasn't the cry of a normal baby, but this kind of high-pitched whine, which was awful to listen to. She would fit so violently that she would go into a banana shape with her head touching her toes, so you couldn't even cuddle her to comfort her. She couldn't suck, so it was almost impossible to feed her. She ended up being fed through a tube in her nose, and later by a tube directly into her stomach.\" </p> <p>Lucy's pain and epilepsy management improved after the first year - by which time she was being given 26 tablets and several medicines each day - but she never had any kind of normal mental development, and all her movements were involuntary. In the last year of her life, she was on constant morphine and oxygen, and was suffering from degeneration of the heart. She died in Carol's arms while Neil was away on holiday with the other children. </p> <p>Can Carol really justify the couple's emotional investment in Lucy, or believe that such a sick child had any true quality of life? \"I would be devastated if I thought Lucy's life had been unhappy and that we had kept her alive for no reason. That little girl had an incredibly strong personality - I'm sure that's why she refused to die for so long. She would respond to music and to all the members of our family, and for the first few years she could smile - she had an amazing ability to make everyone around her smile too. </p> <p>\"She also adored her visits to the Acorns Children's Hospice in Birmingham, which were great for us as well. Those times were the only respite we had, and as her condition deteriorated we literally lived from one visit there to the next. It had a wonderful warm atmosphere, and we knew she was in safe hands. </p> <p>\"Our other kids had a wonderful relationship with Lucy - they used to love helping with her physiotherapy massage, and she taught them a lot about tolerance, and how to relate to people with disabilities.\" </p> <p>Carol doesn't believe they resented the almost constant attention she devoted to their sick sister, or that living with a terminally ill child placed them under unnecessary emotional strain. \"She was so helpless, and her needs were so different from theirs, that jealousy didn't come into it,\" she says. \"Of course, her death was traumatic for them. Even now they are still deeply affected by it. But in some ways I think it has made them more mature. Children today might hear about a grandparent or neighbour dying, but they don't experience it first hand - whereas 100 years ago nearly every family would have had a child that died, and it was just a fact of life.\" </p> <p>It was Carol and Neil who suffered most, however. \"As a parent it was almost impossible to accept that she really was going to die, no matter how much love and care we gave her. \"For at least a year afterwards I had terrible black days, and could tell you the exact number of months, weeks and hours since she died. Neil and I went through a very rocky patch, because his response to her death was denial. He bottled everything up and wouldn't talk about her - I thought it was because he didn't care.\" </p> <p>After more than two decades of non-stop childcare, three of the Wilkinson's own children have now flown the nest, leaving \"only\" four youngsters at home. The smell of baking still fills the couple's five-bedroom house, and regimented lines of shoes and coats still line the hall, but until the recent arrival, Carol says it \"felt a bit empty\". </p> <p>Although taking on another terminally ill child had been discussed before Lucy died, Neil clearly feels a certain amount of trepidation. \"I'll probably go off the deep end again,\" he jokes - and sometimes still seems lost for words when he talks about Lucy. \"My problem was that I never really believed she was going to die, because there had been so many times when family life came to a virtual standstill while we waited for her to die - and she never did. </p> <p>\"In the end we decided that life had to go on around her, because marking time like this was having a negative effect on us all. That's why I wasn't there when she died - I'd taken the other children on holiday while she was having one of her bad turns. I felt terrible guilt, and it took me a long time to come to terms with it.\" </p> <p>Neil isn't alone in having some misgivings about the new baby. Carol says: \"Two of our children still aren't at all happy about us taking him on, and our eldest son was initially against it too, because he felt we would be forgetting about Lucy. But the younger ones are really excited, probably because they dealt with Lucy's death in a different way - they just think she's happy in heaven now.\" </p> <p>On the brink of stepping back into the maelstrom, Neil makes a last effort to explain a decision which, he admits, almost defies explanation. \"It's not the losing or the dying that's important - it's the life that comes before. Living with Lucy was sometimes very difficult, but it was also an incredibly enriching experience. If we can give another child the stability, love and happiness of a home environment, then it balances everything else out.\"</p>",

Eating as many raw fruits and vegetables as possible - preferably scrubbed rather than peeled - also helps enormously as you then get the full hit of antioxidants.\" That said, if someone is either suffering from cancer or is known to be predisposed to the disease, it is worth knowing which foods have particularly useful antioxidants in them.

      "body": "<p><strong> Sense and non-sense</strong><br> <strong> Q:</strong> My sense of smell has completely diminished over the past few years. I've been to the doctor and he can't find a blockage so it's not a sinus/nasal problem. I haven't got around to going to a specialist yet. I'm 27, a non-smoker, vegetarian and am careful about eating a balanced diet. I've tried researching the problem but can't seem to find much info on the subject. The only thing I could come up with is maybe a zinc deficiency. Could this be the case? </p> <p><strong> A:</strong> Loss of smell (anosmia) is usually temporary and caused by a cold or sinusitis. If it persists, you certainly need to see an ear, nose and throat specialist. The usual causes are nasal polyps, allergies or dental problems. Rare causes are side-effects of medicines, insecticide poisoning, radiation treatment for cancers of the head and neck or brain tumours. Deficiencies of copper, zinc or other trace metals have all been touted as causes but are hard to prove. Often, no cause is found and the sense of smell returns as mysteriously as it disappeared. </p> <p><strong> Wart worry</strong><br> <strong> Q: </strong> My children (four and six) are plagued by warts. Our GP says it's a virus called molluscum contagiosum and other than lancing them and dabbing them with iodine (which sounds brutal), there is nothing you can do. Is there anything you could recommend? Are there any homeopathic remedies that might help?</p> <p> <strong>A:</strong> Molluscum have joined headlice, threadworm and verrucas as a rite of passage through nurseries and primary schools. You can leave them alone; the body eventually fights off the virus that causes verrucas and warts and they drop off. But children prone to eczema may get irritating patches of eczema round their molluscum, they can become infected, and they spread easily to others. </p> <p>Dr Richard Aron, consultant dermatologist at the Garden Hospital in North London, says there's no single anti-molluscum drug that works. He applies a cream called EMLA under clingfilm or similar dressing for an hour to numb the skin and then scoops out the moluscum (curettage). He's also investigating whether Aldara cream, used to treat genital and anal warts, works against molluscum. Homeopaths say sucking one thuja tablet a day for a week helps and is safe for all ages. Thuja is widely available in pharmacies and health food shops. See <a href=\"http://www.homeopathydr.com\">www.homeopathydr.com</a>. </p> <p><strong> Spot of bother</strong><br> <strong> Q: </strong> I'm 27 and have suffered from spots for the past 10 years. I've tried many products, none of which have worked. I keep my skin clean, eat plenty of fruit and vegetables and avoid caffeine and excessive amounts of alcohol, but my skin is constantly spotty. I very rarely have periods, which suggests a hormonal link, but when I tried the contraceptive pill, Dianette, it made me depressed, so I stopped taking it. My ovaries have been checked and appear to be fine so there is no obvious reason why I don't have periods. </p> <p><strong> A:</strong> I'm not advocating it, but you could live on chocolate, coffee and alcohol and find that your skin was no worse than if you ate an impeccable diet. Dianette's good for acne because it counteracts the hormone testosterone that contributes to greasy skin and spots. But if Dianette makes you more depressed than the acne, there's no point taking it. </p> <p>Dab-on tropical antibiotics such as Stiemycin or oral antibiotics such as Minocin may work. But if your acne is severe or persistent, I'd ask for a referral to a dermatologist to get Roaccutane. This drug gets a bad press because it causes cracked lips and dry, peeling skin which can feel like you've been sandblasted. You can't get pregnant while on it or for a month after finishing the course, but it works better than anything else. </p> <p>\u0095 These answers are intended to be as accurate and full as possible, but should never be used as a substitute for visiting a doctor and seeking medical help.

Company president Bill Gates urged investors to look to the spring conference in which the world's biggest software company intends to announce a new five-year plan to bring Windows, its dominant software programme, closer to the internet. \"For us, the big thing is going to be Forum 2000,\" he said. By looking to the future, however, the company confirmed the impression that the next few months will not be very exciting at all. </p> <p>Investors were more than conscious of the fact that by the time Forum 2000 opens, possibly at the end of May, the company may be facing a legal decision that it should be broken up, on top of private lawsuits threatening to cost hundreds of billions dollars. </p> <p>Microsoft believes that the future shape of the software industry will make the bundling of its internet browser to Win dows look like old hat. Most of the excitement seen among campus techies by Mr Neukom is partly generated by them trying to add more services and functions to Windows, the software used on more than 90% of the world's computers. </p> <p>Government forces saw the use of the \"software is different\" argument as just an updated way for a company to abuse its stranglehold over a market. They see Microsoft's threats to computer manufacturers and rivals alike as the same as any other traditional company breaking anti-monopolies laws designed to protect consumers. </p> <p>In spite of this gulf between the two sides, they had worked on about 20 drafts of a possible consent decree. Yet they failed to agree on an effective remedy notwithstanding signs that the government was willing to accept something short of a break-up of the company. </p> <p>Microsoft blamed divisions between the justice department and the 19 US states party to the anti-Microsoft action for the failure to bring about an agreement. The states are widely believed to have pushed for a break-up. </p> <p>Mr Neukom said yesterday that such a remedy \"makes no sense whatsoever as a way of dealing with the harm, even if you find that there is such a harm\". </p> <p>Government lawyers are understood to have wanted an effective ban on tying new products as well as uniform pricing for Windows. They did not trust Micro soft, which has previously broken consent decrees. Richard Blumenthal, one of the most vociferous attorneys general on the states' side, said yesterday that the government forces were united and that they would use yesterday's conclusions of law to guide their calls for an effective remedy. </p> <p>\"We have always said that remedies have to be fundamental and far-reaching in order to prevent this kind of behaviour happening again,\" he said. </p> <p>Joel Klein, head of the justice department's anti-trust division, has said that the courts rather than government agencies should define the law on monopolies. </p> <p>Such definitions take time, however. Yesterday's ruling will be followed by a decision on an effective punishment in the next couple of months, An appeal could take nine to 12 months, according to Mr Neukom. The company is to rest part of its case on an earlier court of appeals decision which upheld its ability to tie its internet browser to Windows 95. It is to criticise Judge Jackson's handling of the case and use of inadmissible evidence, a position which has won the support of few legal experts. </p> <p>Several analysts, worried about the effect on share prices of continued legal shenanigans, yesterday followed Microsoft in advising investors to look to the future yesterday. Andrew Roskill, industry analyst at Warburg Dillon Read, believes that the changing nature of the software sector, with everyone supplying internet-dependent products, will make today's arguments about remedies look obsolete. \"In another year, this whole case will seem even more ridiculously moot,\" he said. </p> <p>Analyst Henry Blodget, of Merill Lynch, said that a break-up would make the company more effective. He believes that Microsoft's consumer-oriented internet services should be separated from its corporate software group. A web-focused division could then merge with a pure internet company to create a competitor to America Online Time Warner. \"They are fighting a war on two fronts,\" he said. </p> <p>1993 Justice Department begins anti-trust inquiry into whether Windows has monopoly in PC market. </p> <p>1994 Microsoft agrees to stop punishing PC makers using rival software. 1997 Microsoft launches Internet Explorer to compete with rivals such as Netscape . It is sued for allegedly violating 1994 agreement by forcing manufacturers to promote Explorer. Judge Jackson issues preliminary injunction to stop bundling of Explorer with Windows. Overruled on appeal. </p> <p> 1998 Department of Justice and 20 US states sue for breach of anti-trust law. Texas later drops out. Trial begins on October 19. In November America Online buys Netscape for $10bn. </p> <p>1999 Judge Jackson's findings of fact are sharply critical of Microsoft. He appoints an independent mediator. </p> <p>2000 Settlement talks fail on April 1.</p>",

Government forces saw the use of the \"software is different\" argument as just an updated way for a company to abuse its stranglehold over a market. They see Microsoft's threats to computer manufacturers and rivals alike as the same as any other traditional company breaking anti-monopolies laws designed to protect consumers. In spite of this gulf between the two sides, they had worked on about 20 drafts of a possible consent decree. Yet they failed to agree on an effective remedy notwithstanding signs that the government was willing to accept something short of a break-up of the company. Microsoft blamed divisions between the justice department and the 19 US states party to the anti-Microsoft action for the failure to bring about an agreement. The states are widely believed to have pushed for a break-up. Mr Neukom said yesterday that such a remedy \"makes no sense whatsoever as a way of dealing with the harm, even if you find that there is such a harm\". Government lawyers are understood to have wanted an effective ban on tying new products as well as uniform pricing for Windows. They did not trust Micro soft, which has previously broken consent decrees. Richard Blumenthal, one of the most vociferous attorneys general on the states' side, said yesterday that the government forces were united and that they would use yesterday's conclusions of law to guide their calls for an effective remedy. \"We have always said that remedies have to be fundamental and far-reaching in order to prevent this kind of behaviour happening again,\" he said. Joel Klein, head of the justice department's anti-trust division, has said that the courts rather than government agencies should define the law on monopolies. Such definitions take time, however. Yesterday's ruling will be followed by a decision on an effective punishment in the next couple of months, An appeal could take nine to 12 months, according to Mr Neukom. The company is to rest part of its case on an earlier court of appeals decision which upheld its ability to tie its internet browser to Windows 95. It is to criticise Judge Jackson's handling of the case and use of inadmissible evidence, a position which has won the support of few legal experts. Several analysts, worried about the effect on share prices of continued legal shenanigans, yesterday followed Microsoft in advising investors to look to the future yesterday. Andrew Roskill, industry analyst at Warburg Dillon Read, believes that the changing nature of the software sector, with everyone supplying internet-dependent products, will make today's arguments about remedies look obsolete. \"In another year, this whole case will seem even more ridiculously moot,\" he said. Analyst Henry Blodget, of Merill Lynch, said that a break-up would make the company more effective. He believes that Microsoft's consumer-oriented internet services should be separated from its corporate software group. A web-focused division could then merge with a pure internet company to create a competitor to America Online Time Warner. \"They are fighting a war on two fronts,\" he said. 1993 Justice Department begins anti-trust inquiry into whether Windows has monopoly in PC market. 1994 Microsoft agrees to stop punishing PC makers using rival software. 1997 Microsoft launches Internet Explorer to compete with rivals such as Netscape . It is sued for allegedly violating 1994 agreement by forcing manufacturers to promote Explorer. Judge Jackson issues preliminary injunction to stop bundling of Explorer with Windows. Overruled on appeal. 1998 Department of Justice and 20 US states sue for breach of anti-trust law. Texas later drops out. Trial begins on October 19. In November America Online buys Netscape for $10bn. 1999 Judge Jackson's findings of fact are sharply critical of Microsoft. He appoints an independent mediator. 2000 Settlement talks fail on April 1.",

This is all the more true of her journals. They are little less than the proof of psychosis. This new edition, 730 pages long, carefully transcribed from the originals, adds an enormous amount of material to the previous one, published only in the States, including two entirely new volumes, from the years 1957-1959, one of which contains raw and bloody material from her private therapy sessions. These expanded journals make Plath more than ever terrifying: self-obsessive, raging, living at an unendurable pitch of intensity. They go far to confirm Hughes's helpless version of events ... It is unfortunate that such pain and hatred, such deadliness, should have been thought a model for anyone, particularly for women, particularly for schoolchildren. The gradual absorption of these journals will at least make that mistake more difficult.\"</p> <p> The Carey-Sexton axis, the view that Plath was basically bonkers, had no gainsayers.

A number of small clubs opposed the structure of the deal, claiming it would increase the gap between rich and poor. </p> <p>The tender document divides up the broadcasting of football into seven packages. </p> <p>At the core of the deal will be the 66-live-games-per-season package, with matches to be broadcast on Sundays or Mondays.

That deal between the broadcaster and the Premier League expires at the end of next season. </p> <p>The new one will also lead to first-class domestic football being screened on a pay-per-view basis for the first time. </p> <p>Under the proposals 40 such matches will be shown each season, each kicking-off at 2pm on a Sunday. </p> <p>The broadcaster who wins the bid will be allowed to feature the same club on a maximum of six occasions a season, and all Premiership teams will have to be shown on pay per view at least once during that time. </p> <p>There will also be two highlights programmes featured on British terrestrial television each weekend. </p> <p>The terms of the Saturday evening highlights package - currently owned by the BBC - will contractually oblige the broadcaster to show them at a fixed, unalterable time. </p> <p>Another package of highlights to be broadcast on Sun days from 9pm is also to be made available. It will feature highlights of Saturday games and any Sunday afternoon matches.</p> <p>Both packages will be available only to free-to-air broadcasters. </p> <p>Richard Scudamore, the chief executive of the Premier League, said: \"We feel that this is a very balanced document. It allows consumers more choice and gives clubs greater flexibility. </p> <p>\"I have to emphasise that the deal has not been done but it is a pointer towards what the future deal will look like.\" </p> <p>The most revolutionary aspects of the deal are the concessions made to the country's larger clubs, who will thus be able to cash in further on their popularity. </p> <p>For the first time clubs will have the rights to broadcast matches they are involved in on their own channels. This could generate millions in extra revenue for the likes of Manchester United and Liverpool, who already have their own channels. </p> <p>Under the new proposals clubs will also have the right to broadcast their Saturday afternoon matches from Sunday midnight onwards. </p> <p>Sunday afternoon matches can be shown from 10pm on Mondays and games played on Monday evenings can be shown from midnight onwards. </p> <p>Clubs will also have the rights to show matches on their own websites once the weekend is over. Scudamore said: \"This allows for clubs to provide a proper service to their fans worldwide.\" </p> <p>A sub-licence is also to be put up for tender allowing broadcasters to experiment with mobile phone technology, so that matches or highlights can be broadcast on the screens of handsets. </p> <p><strong> Seven ways to sell football </strong><br> </p> <p>\u0095<strong> The main deal </strong> Sixty-six live games played at 4pm on Sundays and at 8pm on Mondays, with the right to show highlights programme on Sunday mornings. </p> <p>\u0095<strong> Pay-per-view</strong> Forty live games to be shown on pay-per-view basis. There could be up to three Sunday games but first and second choice will go to 'main deal' broadcaster. BSkyB, NTL and Ondigital likely to bid. Cost of games to be carefully examined, says the Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore, right. </p> <p>\u0095<strong> Saturday highlights</strong> Reserved for terrestrial channels; BBC likely to face competition from ITV and possibly Channel 5. </p> <p>\u0095<strong> Sunday highlights</strong> A reintroduction. Reserved for free-to-air TV. </p> <p>\u0095<strong> Clubs' channels</strong> Currently use only archive material but in-house channels such as MUTV will now show their own matches on a delayed basis. </p> <p>\u0095<strong> Internet </strong> Clubs can show their own Saturday, Sunday and Monday games on their websites after midnight on Monday. </p> <p>\u0095<strong> Sub-licences </strong> To be awarded on experimental basis for 'video on demand' and mobile phones.

The new one will also lead to first-class domestic football being screened on a pay-per-view basis for the first time. Under the proposals 40 such matches will be shown each season, each kicking-off at 2pm on a Sunday. The broadcaster who wins the bid will be allowed to feature the same club on a maximum of six occasions a season, and all Premiership teams will have to be shown on pay per view at least once during that time. There will also be two highlights programmes featured on British terrestrial television each weekend. The terms of the Saturday evening highlights package - currently owned by the BBC - will contractually oblige the broadcaster to show them at a fixed, unalterable time. Another package of highlights to be broadcast on Sun days from 9pm is also to be made available. It will feature highlights of Saturday games and any Sunday afternoon matches. Both packages will be available only to free-to-air broadcasters. Richard Scudamore, the chief executive of the Premier League, said: \"We feel that this is a very balanced document. It allows consumers more choice and gives clubs greater flexibility. \"I have to emphasise that the deal has not been done but it is a pointer towards what the future deal will look like.\" The most revolutionary aspects of the deal are the concessions made to the country's larger clubs, who will thus be able to cash in further on their popularity. For the first time clubs will have the rights to broadcast matches they are involved in on their own channels. This could generate millions in extra revenue for the likes of Manchester United and Liverpool, who already have their own channels. Under the new proposals clubs will also have the right to broadcast their Saturday afternoon matches from Sunday midnight onwards. Sunday afternoon matches can be shown from 10pm on Mondays and games played on Monday evenings can be shown from midnight onwards. Clubs will also have the rights to show matches on their own websites once the weekend is over. Scudamore said: \"This allows for clubs to provide a proper service to their fans worldwide.\" A sub-licence is also to be put up for tender allowing broadcasters to experiment with mobile phone technology, so that matches or highlights can be broadcast on the screens of handsets. Seven ways to sell football \u0095 The main deal Sixty-six live games played at 4pm on Sundays and at 8pm on Mondays, with the right to show highlights programme on Sunday mornings. \u0095 Pay-per-view Forty live games to be shown on pay-per-view basis. There could be up to three Sunday games but first and second choice will go to 'main deal' broadcaster. BSkyB, NTL and Ondigital likely to bid. Cost of games to be carefully examined, says the Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore, right. \u0095 Saturday highlights Reserved for terrestrial channels; BBC likely to face competition from ITV and possibly Channel 5. \u0095 Sunday highlights A reintroduction. Reserved for free-to-air TV. \u0095 Clubs' channels Currently use only archive material but in-house channels such as MUTV will now show their own matches on a delayed basis. \u0095 Internet Clubs can show their own Saturday, Sunday and Monday games on their websites after midnight on Monday. \u0095 Sub-licences To be awarded on experimental basis for 'video on demand' and mobile phones. Overseas and radio rights yet to be dealt with.",

Now, 14 years later, a film about her life threatens to reopen old wounds. </p> <p>Yoyes was released in cinemas throughout Spain, including the Basque country, at the weekend. The film breaks a taboo on using the terrorist group, which has killed some 800 people in its 30-year campaign for an independent Basque state, as subject matter for the cinema. </p> <p>\"Compared to the American cinema, or the British, which has touched on the most painful aspects of its history, and made many films on Northern Ireland, the Spanish cinema has tiptoed around subjects like ETA terrorism despite their decisive influence on the country,\" said Guillermo Altares, film critic of the daily El Pais. </p> <p>The film traces the life of Dolores Gonzalez Catarain - known by the codename Yoyes - from her early involvement with ETA in the Basque country and France, through her exile in Mexico from Paris and her eventual return to Spain. </p> <p>It shows her going in 1973 to France, where most of the leadership were based, and taking over responsibility for ETA's political wing. </p> <p>Yoyes is seen wielding a gun in target practice but not carrying out a terrorist attack. </p> <p>The film includes real footage of the prime minister at the time announcing to a roomful of cheering Eta mem bers that Franco had died. </p> <p>It then follows Yoyes's gradual disillusionment, after a particularly bloody bomb attack on a Madrid cafeteria, and her decision to break with the group and seek exile in Mexico. </p> <p>\"I have tried to tell the truth,\" said Helena Taberna, the director, whose treatment of Yoyes is broadly sympathetic. </p> <p>The film focuses on Yoyes's love affairs and marriage to a philosophy professor, the birth of her son, and her agonising over whether to return to Spain in the early 80s when the country had become a democracy after Franco's death and former terrorists were offered an amnesty. </p> <p>\"Neither one side or the other will let me live in peace,\" Yoyes says in the film, which ends with her son witnessing her death in 1986 in a crowded market place, where she was shot at point-blank range by a member of ETA who considered her a traitor. </p> <p>\"This is one woman's story, based on her right to change and on the times she lived in,\" said Ms Taberna, who acknowledged that at first it was difficult to get funding for the film, an Italian, French and Spanish co-production, which received 20m pesetas (about \u00a372,000) in subsidies from the Basque regional government run by the Basque Nationalist party. </p> <p>\"People haven't made films on ETA because they were scared,\" said Andres Vicente Gomez, a producer. </p> <p>Yoyes was filmed last spring, virtually under cover, on location in the Spanish Basque country and in France during the truce declared by ETA when it looked as if peace might be possible. </p> <p>Its release coincides with renewed conflict after ETA's decision to end the ceasefire in December. </p> <p>So far this year there have been three deaths; threats against politicians, businessmen and journalists, one of whom received a bomb in a cigar box last week which failed to go off; and a sense that peace is further away than ever. At the weekend there was widespread street violence in the Basque country. </p> <p>Ms Taberna has been praised for her courage in tackling the subject, but criticised for equating ETA with the self-proclaimed Anti-Liberation Groups, known as Gal, which waged a bungled dirty war against the terrorist group in the early 1980s. </p> <p>Gal's links to the governments in Madrid at the time are still under investigation. </p> <p>A minister shown in the film bears a strong resemblance to a minister who is currently on trial together with a top paramilitary civil guard general. They are accused of involve ment in the deaths of two ETA members. </p> <p>\"Of course the Gal should not have happened, but it [the dirty war] went on for only three years, not 30,\" said one Basque MP. </p> <p>\"We're starting to break the taboo,\" said Borja Hermoso of the daily El Mundo. \"But there is still a sense that the subject needs to be handled carefully.\" </p> <p>\"It's still very much alive. I'm not surprised people don't dare tackle it,\" said Jose Sacristan, an actor involved in another film on ETA. </p> <p>\"Those who have done have been quite rigorous. It is better to have fewer films and that they should maintain that rigour.\"</p>",

The film breaks a taboo on using the terrorist group, which has killed some 800 people in its 30-year campaign for an independent Basque state, as subject matter for the cinema. \"Compared to the American cinema, or the British, which has touched on the most painful aspects of its history, and made many films on Northern Ireland, the Spanish cinema has tiptoed around subjects like ETA terrorism despite their decisive influence on the country,\" said Guillermo Altares, film critic of the daily El Pais. The film traces the life of Dolores Gonzalez Catarain - known by the codename Yoyes - from her early involvement with ETA in the Basque country and France, through her exile in Mexico from Paris and her eventual return to Spain. It shows her going in 1973 to France, where most of the leadership were based, and taking over responsibility for ETA's political wing. Yoyes is seen wielding a gun in target practice but not carrying out a terrorist attack. The film includes real footage of the prime minister at the time announcing to a roomful of cheering Eta mem bers that Franco had died. It then follows Yoyes's gradual disillusionment, after a particularly bloody bomb attack on a Madrid cafeteria, and her decision to break with the group and seek exile in Mexico. \"I have tried to tell the truth,\" said Helena Taberna, the director, whose treatment of Yoyes is broadly sympathetic. The film focuses on Yoyes's love affairs and marriage to a philosophy professor, the birth of her son, and her agonising over whether to return to Spain in the early 80s when the country had become a democracy after Franco's death and former terrorists were offered an amnesty. \"Neither one side or the other will let me live in peace,\" Yoyes says in the film, which ends with her son witnessing her death in 1986 in a crowded market place, where she was shot at point-blank range by a member of ETA who considered her a traitor. \"This is one woman's story, based on her right to change and on the times she lived in,\" said Ms Taberna, who acknowledged that at first it was difficult to get funding for the film, an Italian, French and Spanish co-production, which received 20m pesetas (about \u00a372,000) in subsidies from the Basque regional government run by the Basque Nationalist party. \"People haven't made films on ETA because they were scared,\" said Andres Vicente Gomez, a producer. Yoyes was filmed last spring, virtually under cover, on location in the Spanish Basque country and in France during the truce declared by ETA when it looked as if peace might be possible. Its release coincides with renewed conflict after ETA's decision to end the ceasefire in December. So far this year there have been three deaths; threats against politicians, businessmen and journalists, one of whom received a bomb in a cigar box last week which failed to go off; and a sense that peace is further away than ever. At the weekend there was widespread street violence in the Basque country. Ms Taberna has been praised for her courage in tackling the subject, but criticised for equating ETA with the self-proclaimed Anti-Liberation Groups, known as Gal, which waged a bungled dirty war against the terrorist group in the early 1980s. Gal's links to the governments in Madrid at the time are still under investigation. A minister shown in the film bears a strong resemblance to a minister who is currently on trial together with a top paramilitary civil guard general. They are accused of involve ment in the deaths of two ETA members. \"Of course the Gal should not have happened, but it [the dirty war] went on for only three years, not 30,\" said one Basque MP. \"We're starting to break the taboo,\" said Borja Hermoso of the daily El Mundo. \"But there is still a sense that the subject needs to be handled carefully.\" \"It's still very much alive. I'm not surprised people don't dare tackle it,\" said Jose Sacristan, an actor involved in another film on ETA. \"Those who have done have been quite rigorous. It is better to have fewer films and that they should maintain that rigour.\"",

Today's ruling was not unexpected, given the Court's earlier findings. But there are several steps ahead in this case. While we did everything that we could to settle this case, and will continue to look for new opportunities to resolve it, we believe that we have a strong case on appeal. The Appeals Court has already affirmed Microsoft's right to build Internet capabilities into the Windows operating system to benefit consumers. This ruling turns on its head the reality that consumers know, that our software has helped make PC's more accessible and affordable to millions. We started with just a few simple ideas, and the results have helped bring lower prices, improve productivity and enormous benefits to consumers. As we look ahead to the appeals process, innovation will continue to be the number one priority at Microsoft. Microsoft's past success has been built on innovation and creativity, and our future success depends on that ability to keep innovating in the fastest changing market place on earth. We recognize we have a responsibility to provide positive leadership on behalf of consumers and our industry. We take this responsibility very seriously. </p> <p> The high tech industry that Microsoft has helped to create has unleashed a wave of competition and innovation. We have constantly seen more powerful products for consumers at lower prices than ever before. This high tech explosion has dramatically increased business productivity. And our industry is an engine of the American economy and the global economy. </p> <p> It's important to note how much the high technology industry has changed in just the two years since this case was filed. We are seeing amazing new technologies that build on the power of the PC to offer consumers everything from Web phones to smart kitchen appliances. There are record-breaking mergers, reshaping the competitive landscape. When you look at the incredible pace of technological change, it's clear that Microsoft, and every other company must compete and innovate in order to survive and prosper. </p> <p> Above all, as this process moves forward, we will continue to innovate and deliver the best solutions for our customers. We are committed to continue to hire great people, to listen to our customers, to invest in the future and to create the next great generation of software. While our legal team works to resolve the case, we will put our energy and our focus on these new ideas, new innovations and new software that will improve people's lives. Thank you. </p> <p> <strong>Steve Ballmer:</strong> Hello. When people ask me about this case, I tell them three things. I tell them that the right of appeal is a fundamental tenet of the American legal system and that until the appeal is over, nothing is settled. We have learned that from experience. </p> <p> I tell them I couldn't be more proud of this great company, its incredible employees and its breakthrough products, and I tell them that I believe in this company more today than I ever have. I believe in our people, our technology, and our vision. We need to stay very focused in on that.</p> <p> It's important for us to all think about what today's ruling means and about what it does not mean. The ruling does not change the challenges and opportunities before us. Windows 2000 is the foundation for a whole new generation of products and services that will make the dream of Next Generation Window Services on the Internet a powerful reality. The combined power of amazing software, the Internet, and wireless technologies will free our products from the desktop and server and take them into literally every corner and walk of life. </p> <p> If you take a look at devices like pocket PC's, smart kitchen appliances, the MiPad that Bill had a chance to unveil last month, it's really quite amazing. And the boundaries of innovation are really being expanded as never before. And it's those incredible opportunities and challenges that will shape the destiny of Microsoft and our industry. At the same time, we do recognize that we have a special responsibility to set a positive example in our industry. </p> <p> We spent the past 25 years thinking of ourselves as a small, aggressive company playing catch-up to industry giants, even though at some point along the way we became a large company. Our success has really come from the opportunities that Microsoft and Windows have created for consumers and for thousands and thousands of companies, even while we competed with the few of those companies. We have failed to adequately demonstrate all of that opportunity for consumers and business alike. </p> <p> Our intense focus on moving forward has at times been threatening and our passion for this has been misinterpreted. We can do better, but that doesn't mean innovating any less or delivering any less value to consumers. It does mean that values we hold dear -- opportunity for everyone, integrity, innovation, customer focus and partnership -- have been called into question today. We continue to cherish those values as we always have. </p> <p> In the coming weeks, I intend to speak directly with many of our key customers and partners to assure them that today's ruling will not cause us to slow our efforts to provide them with the products and services they need to run their businesses. I had an opportunity this morning to talk to a wonderful software developer building on our platform and the list and range of new things that they want to see in the basic platform was daunting, but we are dedicated to delivering on the kinds of things that folks like that want. </p> <p> As Bill said, the reality the consumers know is different than one might think today. They see the wonders of what technology and competition has done for their lives. Microsoft has been focused in on that and will continue to be so. I thank you very much for this opportunity.</p>",

One wondered, however, if the Koreans and Bosnians would have been so keen on America if they'd been shown Getting High - The History Of LSD (History Channel) first. To the accompaniment of sitar music, this film explored the CIA's testing of LSD as a potential Cold War weapon. More often than not, by agents lacing each other's tea at the Pentagon (I suppose it beat killing the afternoon by chewing a pencil). The japes had to stop when a scientist threw himself from a window. There's always one, isn't there? Boy, what a downer.",

Mr Krajisnik, who was a member of Bosnia's collective presidency after the Bosnian war ended in 1995, was charged in a secret indictment with genocide and crimes against humanity for acts committed in 1991 and 1992, during which time he also served as the parliamentary speaker. His indictment by the tribunal in February is bound to raise questions about timing and the implications it may have for other notable Bosnian Serbs. Two of Mr Krajisnik's closest associates, Radovan Karadzic, the leader of the main Bosnian Serb political party, and General Ratko Mladic, were indicted several years ago, although they have never been arrested.

      "bodyText": "No one was breaking out the champagne at the Hague war crimes tribunal yesterday, but Nato's capture of Momcilo Krajisnik is a real achievement that will raise hopes that the big fish of Bosnia's war may finally face justice. Mr Krajisnik, the former right-hand man to Radovan Karadzic - who is still at large - is the most senior suspect to face the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia nearly seven years after it was set up. But his arrest is only the latest in a string of successes which has focused attention on the former insurance company premises in a leafy suburb of the Dutch capital - and hugely bolstered the reputation of the UN court. In courtroom number one, flanked by guards in blue UN uniform and facing judges from Portugal, Egypt and the US, the Bosnian Serb general Radislav Kirstic is in the fourth week of his trial. Gen Kirstic, seized in December 1998, is accused of genocide for his part in the Srebrenica massacre, when 7,500 Bosnian Muslims were systematically killed in July 1995 - in a UN \"safe area\" - in Europe's worst atrocity since the Holocaust. Two other generals held responsible for the brutal Serb siege of Sarajevo, Momir Talic and Stanislav Galic, are also in custody. But their commander, Ratko Mladic, was seen recently at a Yugoslavia-China soccer game in Belgrade. Next door to Gen Kirstic, three low-ranking Serb soldiers from the once-idyllic Drina valley town of Foca are facing unprecedented charges of crimes against humanity for serial gang-rape, torture and sexual enslavement. The prosecution says these men and their appalling personal brutality made possible the larger project of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia's three-and-a-half year war. Not only Serbs are facing justice. Croatia, newly embarked on the path of democracy, has just handed over the ailing warlord Mladen Naletelic, accused of murder and torture in Mostar. A few days before the tribunal passed a 45-year sentence on another Bosnian Croat, General Tihomir Blaskic. In all, 39 people are being held in the Dutch prison nearby at Scheveningen. Yet if these are exciting times for the tribunal, too little happened for too long, largely because Balkan governments ignored their obligations under the Dayton peace accords and international law. The recent successes are attributed to the practice of issuing sealed indictments, under which an investigation is mounted and evidence submitted to one of the court's 14 judges, who then accepts a prosecution request for non-disclosure. Pioneered by the Canadian prosecutor Louise Arbour, this method reaped rewards after the first Nato snatch operation in July 1997. The tribunal was helped by the fact that governments, in cluding Britain's newly-elected Labour one, started to hand over classified intelligence, such as communications intercepts. Croatia's cooperation is one highly significant improvement, but recently even the justice minister of Republika Srpksa visited the Hague. But it is not clear - in the light of the Kosovo atrocities before Nato's intervention - that there has been much of a deterrent effect. \"Getting hold of Krajisnik makes this a very good day for us,\" the tribunal spokesman, Jim Landale, said last night. \"But we still haven't landed any of the very biggest fish. Maybe when we get them we'll break out the champagne.\"",

      "body": "<p>In Zimbabwe the past is another country. But the embodiment of that country is still with us. And he has had a pretty good weekend. After all, he told us it would happen, incessantly. Ian Smith, prime minister of Rhodesia from 1964 to 1979, took his country through treason and sanctions and war rather than submit to black rule.</p> <p>In rough outline, he predicted Saturday's attack on the anti-government marchers 40 years ago. He was doing his best not to gloat. \"We're pretty well in a state of anarchy, so I don't think it should surprise anyone who understands politics. It was a dreadful incident. People beaten with sticks and whips, including ladies . Par for the course, though. This is where we live. Dreadful.\"</p> <p>It doesn't feel all that dreadful, though. He sits in a comfy armchair in his front room amid the over-fussy decoration beloved by colonialists of his generation. He is 80 now and a widower, a bit lonely I think (why else would he welcome the Guardian so readily?), but he is still fit, and has not lost a solitary marble.</p> <p>He looks out on to a glorious lawn, fronting an avenue shaded by old jacaranda trees. He has less security than the average middle-ranked executive in Johannesburg. Only one thing jars: poking up behind his bougainvillea is a huge radio mast. Ian Smith's next-door neighbour is the Cuban embassy. He is not a humorous man, but this is probably the best joke in Harare. \"They're very nice,\" says Smith. \"I said in an interview that I preferred the Cubans to Mugabe, and the ambassador has waved cheerfully ever since.\"</p> <p>There is a logical flaw here, since Smith's first allegation (of many) against Zimbabwe's current president, Robert Mugabe, is that he is a communist. This provided the only moment during our conversation when I was convinced I had him nailed.</p> <p>\"He is a communist,\" Smith was saying. \"Still is. Absolutely dedicated. He stays in power so he can do what he wants to do.\"</p> <p>\"Some people might say that's what you did.\"</p> <p>\"THAT'S A LIE.\"</p> <p>It was an unusually unsubtle get-out. Time and again I asked him during the interview, in different ways, if (1) he had made mistakes; (2) he blamed himself at all for his country's plight; and (3) he regretted what he had done. The answers were: yes (though he declined to specify any mistakes); no; and \"I don't dwell on the past.\"</p> <p>Funnily enough, the last bit was probably the biggest lie of all. The whole Rhodesian adventure was a piece of quixotry straight out of the past. A year after he took over, Smith made a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) to prevent Britain forcing him to accept majority rule. There were fewer than a quarter of a million whites, and 5m blacks.</p> <p>Harold Wilson considered invasion, then backed away, uncertain even of the British army's loyalty. White Rhodesia flourished, evading economic sanctions for more than a decade with a mix of 10% skill and ingenuity and 90% South African support. Britain looked pathetic. Then, as guerrilla warfare intensified, the South African president, the old soak and bully John Vorster, decided that this sideshow was jeopardising his own regime's survival, and forced Rhodesia to capitulate.</p> <p>By Smith's armchair is his own book, The Great Betrayal, which refers to the South Africans' behaviour. He also has Reach for the Sky, the biography of the war hero Douglas Bader; The Abolition of Britain, a sort of past-dweller's handbook by the eccentric Daily Express writer Peter Hitchens; and a compilation of cartoons by Giles, another Express favourite. I didn't dare tell him the paper is now edited by a dope-smoking Labour supporter, and a woman - no, lady - at that.</p> <p>He also has a huge painting of Spitfires over the Italian mountains, which is what he flew and where he flew them. He doesn't need much prompting to mention the war: that war, not the one he precipitated.</p> <p>Otherwise, his conversation is mostly about long-ago negotiations with politicians, mostly dead, all of whom were evidently far trickier than he was. UDI was not illegal, he insisted, the lawyers said so: it was a response to a breach of contract by the British.</p> <p>\"We had majority rule,\" said Smith. \"We had responsible majority rule. It was a system British ministers said to me time and again was a success. Harold Macmillan said so; Alec Home said so. On the day of UDI, Harold Wilson pleaded with me, 'Ian, please have a little more patience. You are our model for Africa.' Then he rushed to the House of Commons and said I was a traitor.\" Smith despises inconsistency in others but will never recognise it in himself. It is a very Rhodesian sort of trait.</p> <p>But his greatest venom is reserved for Mugabe. \"When you see what these communist gangsters have done to this country.\" He shakes his head. \"They inherited a wonderful country. He told me so. The day the 1980 election results came out he rang and asked me to see him.</p> <p>\"Mugabe sat me down and said, 'I just want to tell you how lucky we are inheriting this jewel of Africa. We want to keep it that way.' He couldn't have been kinder or more polite. I couldn't believe what I heard. He talked like a sophisticated westerner, not like a communist. I said, 'You said it to me. Will you say it in public? And he did.</p> <p>\"I used to go and see him regularly for the first 18 months, and he couldn't have been more gracious. Then suddenly he had a rush of blood and decided to create a one-party Marxist state. I was never welcome after that and I've never seen him since. Now we have a dictatorship. It's totalitarianism. You're not allowed to disagree, you're allowed to agree.\"</p> <p>It is a little hard to see how you can simultaneously have both totalitarianism and anarchy. And anyway, here we are in his sitting room, and he is disagreeing like crazy. \"Mugabe never had such freedom in your day, did he?\"</p> <p>\"He had complete freedom. He was only arrested because he practised subversion, unconstitutional methods.\" Mugabe spent years in jail; Smith is incensed because he has been briefly arrested three times.</p> <p>\"It doesn't feel like a communist country, does it?\"</p> <p>\"In the last couple of years, yes, people have spoken out. They're very clever, these totalitarian people. They took over the communications media, they instituted the CIO [Central Intelligence Organisation], which is as good as any Gestapo on the face of the earth.</p> <p>\"You know, my friend, Africa is different. It's nothing like the free world. They believe in chiefs, in dictatorship.\"</p> <p>And so you go round in circles. Never mind that Smith's constitution denied the majority anything but the most rudimentary say. Come to think of it, peaceful demonstrations against the government were not a major feature of life under the Smith government. I tried to find something on which he might agree with Mugabe: and it's true, he doesn't care for homosexuality either.</p> <p>\"I was brought up to believe it wasn't part of life. Sodomy was a crime. We were given this [he glances discreetly downwards] to procreate. I'm now told that there are inherent reasons for people being that way, that there's medical evidence. Well, all right, but you should keep it to yourself and not influence young people. I don't like it.\"</p> <p>He is worried about the internet too: \"I'm a bit worried from what I hear of it. I hear it's a bit unsavoury, a lot of smut.\" And he is concerned about the British young: \"I don't think they have enough pride in Britain.\"</p> <p>Here we have the very nub of Rhodesia. It was a country that embodied the values of the old Daily Express, where acceptable subversion might be safely contained in a Giles cartoon. Smith's Rhodesia (\"Surrey with the lunatic fringe on top,\" as it was once characterised) had many old-fashioned Home Counties virtues: neighbourliness, civic pride, politeness, efficiency, practicality, discipline, reticence, pluck and a little light charity. For better or worse, women were always ladies (usually making the teas, not going on demos). It is as though the world was defied for a decade by some gigantic local bowls club.</p> <p>Smith himself was an unpretentious and accessible leader, driving home for lunch in a little Peugeot. Good old Smithy! Nowadays, Avis give renters special instructions about how to behave when confronted by a presidential motorcade.</p> <p>But the Rhodesians could not face up to the contradictions of their privilege and their position. There was no Great Betrayal. They were betrayed only by their own narrow-mindedness, selfishness and ignorance.</p> <p>\"We were not racialists,\" Smith insists. And it is true that Rhodesia had no Whites Only signs, like South Africa. The phrase was \"Right of Admission Reserved\". Most people did not have to be told what that meant.</p> <p>Even now, Smith purports to believe that Mugabe has never won a fair election, and that he cheated more moderate leaders out of what was theirs - an assertion which everyone who understands anything of Zimbabwean politics thinks is nonsense.</p> <p>Ian Smith understood everything about Rhodesia. But that was another country. Indeed, it wasn't even a country at all.</p>",

White Rhodesia flourished, evading economic sanctions for more than a decade with a mix of 10% skill and ingenuity and 90% South African support. Britain looked pathetic. Then, as guerrilla warfare intensified, the South African president, the old soak and bully John Vorster, decided that this sideshow was jeopardising his own regime's survival, and forced Rhodesia to capitulate. By Smith's armchair is his own book, The Great Betrayal, which refers to the South Africans' behaviour. He also has Reach for the Sky, the biography of the war hero Douglas Bader; The Abolition of Britain, a sort of past-dweller's handbook by the eccentric Daily Express writer Peter Hitchens; and a compilation of cartoons by Giles, another Express favourite. I didn't dare tell him the paper is now edited by a dope-smoking Labour supporter, and a woman - no, lady - at that. He also has a huge painting of Spitfires over the Italian mountains, which is what he flew and where he flew them. He doesn't need much prompting to mention the war: that war, not the one he precipitated. Otherwise, his conversation is mostly about long-ago negotiations with politicians, mostly dead, all of whom were evidently far trickier than he was. UDI was not illegal, he insisted, the lawyers said so: it was a response to a breach of contract by the British. \"We had majority rule,\" said Smith. \"We had responsible majority rule. It was a system British ministers said to me time and again was a success. Harold Macmillan said so; Alec Home said so. On the day of UDI, Harold Wilson pleaded with me, 'Ian, please have a little more patience. You are our model for Africa.' Then he rushed to the House of Commons and said I was a traitor.\" Smith despises inconsistency in others but will never recognise it in himself. It is a very Rhodesian sort of trait. But his greatest venom is reserved for Mugabe. \"When you see what these communist gangsters have done to this country.\" He shakes his head. \"They inherited a wonderful country. He told me so. The day the 1980 election results came out he rang and asked me to see him. \"Mugabe sat me down and said, 'I just want to tell you how lucky we are inheriting this jewel of Africa. We want to keep it that way.' He couldn't have been kinder or more polite. I couldn't believe what I heard. He talked like a sophisticated westerner, not like a communist. I said, 'You said it to me. Will you say it in public? And he did. \"I used to go and see him regularly for the first 18 months, and he couldn't have been more gracious. Then suddenly he had a rush of blood and decided to create a one-party Marxist state. I was never welcome after that and I've never seen him since. Now we have a dictatorship. It's totalitarianism. You're not allowed to disagree, you're allowed to agree.\" It is a little hard to see how you can simultaneously have both totalitarianism and anarchy. And anyway, here we are in his sitting room, and he is disagreeing like crazy. \"Mugabe never had such freedom in your day, did he?\" \"He had complete freedom. He was only arrested because he practised subversion, unconstitutional methods.\" Mugabe spent years in jail; Smith is incensed because he has been briefly arrested three times. \"It doesn't feel like a communist country, does it?\" \"In the last couple of years, yes, people have spoken out. They're very clever, these totalitarian people. They took over the communications media, they instituted the CIO [Central Intelligence Organisation], which is as good as any Gestapo on the face of the earth. \"You know, my friend, Africa is different. It's nothing like the free world. They believe in chiefs, in dictatorship.\" And so you go round in circles. Never mind that Smith's constitution denied the majority anything but the most rudimentary say. Come to think of it, peaceful demonstrations against the government were not a major feature of life under the Smith government. I tried to find something on which he might agree with Mugabe: and it's true, he doesn't care for homosexuality either. \"I was brought up to believe it wasn't part of life. Sodomy was a crime. We were given this [he glances discreetly downwards] to procreate. I'm now told that there are inherent reasons for people being that way, that there's medical evidence. Well, all right, but you should keep it to yourself and not influence young people. I don't like it.\" He is worried about the internet too: \"I'm a bit worried from what I hear of it. I hear it's a bit unsavoury, a lot of smut.\" And he is concerned about the British young: \"I don't think they have enough pride in Britain.\" Here we have the very nub of Rhodesia. It was a country that embodied the values of the old Daily Express, where acceptable subversion might be safely contained in a Giles cartoon. Smith's Rhodesia (\"Surrey with the lunatic fringe on top,\" as it was once characterised) had many old-fashioned Home Counties virtues: neighbourliness, civic pride, politeness, efficiency, practicality, discipline, reticence, pluck and a little light charity. For better or worse, women were always ladies (usually making the teas, not going on demos). It is as though the world was defied for a decade by some gigantic local bowls club. Smith himself was an unpretentious and accessible leader, driving home for lunch in a little Peugeot. Good old Smithy! Nowadays, Avis give renters special instructions about how to behave when confronted by a presidential motorcade. But the Rhodesians could not face up to the contradictions of their privilege and their position. There was no Great Betrayal. They were betrayed only by their own narrow-mindedness, selfishness and ignorance. \"We were not racialists,\" Smith insists. And it is true that Rhodesia had no Whites Only signs, like South Africa. The phrase was \"Right of Admission Reserved\". Most people did not have to be told what that meant. Even now, Smith purports to believe that Mugabe has never won a fair election, and that he cheated more moderate leaders out of what was theirs - an assertion which everyone who understands anything of Zimbabwean politics thinks is nonsense. Ian Smith understood everything about Rhodesia. But that was another country. Indeed, it wasn't even a country at all.",

She was prevented from travelling to three villages outside Grozny where international human rights monitors say Chechen civilians were massacred by Russian troops. Her requests to inspect several detention centres where Russian troops were alleged to have tortured prisoners were also ignored. Instead, she was taken to a jail in Grozny where the only inmates were two women held for theft. Her Russian hosts added insult to injury by cancelling meetings with senior government officials in Moscow yesterday after her return from the north Caucasus was delayed by a day, officially because inclement weather kept her grounded in Dagestan, neighbouring Chechnya. \"The high commissioner had asked to visit a number of locations, none of which were satisfied. So there was some disappointment and frustration,\" said her spokesman, Jose Diaz, adding that he would describe the visit to the jail in Grozny as \"ironic\". Vladimir Kalamanov, president-elect Vladimir Putin's special representative for human rights in Chechnya, dismissed the UN's complaints, insisting that \"we have honoured our commitments\". \"We were quite open, we showed her everything she wanted to see,\" he said. Mrs Robinson has infuriated the Kremlin with her outspoken criticism of Russia's human rights record in Chechnya. Moscow denied her permission to visit the republic in February when she declared that war crimes could not be perpetrated there with impunity. She repeated the criticism in Chechnya. \"I am hearing of very serious problems of human rights violations carried out by those in Russian military uniforms, special forces uniforms,\" she said. \"It is very important that these be fully investigated and that those responsible do not have impunity.\" Elsewhere yesterday the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH), which is based in Paris, also stepped up the pressure on Moscow to own up to its troops' human rights abuses in Chechnya. Following a week-long mission to the region, the FIDH said: \"The civilian population is the first target of the operations carried out by the Russians . . . who are responsible for the most serious violations of human rights and international law. These violations constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity.\" The Russian hostility to Mrs Robinson was not unexpected since she had enraged the Kremlin with the requests she made before arriving in Moscow last Friday. Her letter asked for \"information on mass human rights violations by Russian troops or [Chechen] terrorists\". \"That's an insult,\" Mr Kalamanov told the Guardian. \"Ours is a modern, civilised European army.

That makes us angry.\" During her trip to the Caucasus, Mrs Robinson also met some of the tens of thousands of refugees in Ingushetia. Accompanying her, Oleg Mironov, Russia's human rights commissioner, belittled the catalogue of complaints from the homeless. \"Conclusions cannot be drawn only from the words of excited people in refugee camps,\" he said. Other officials said the lack of transparency on Mrs Robinson's tour was predictable. \"The Russians don't want to show Robinson the real face of what this war is all about,\" said Diederik Lohman, the Moscow director of the New York-based Human Rights Watch. \"It's not surprising.\" The FIDH said Russia should be banished from the Council of Europe for its conduct in Chechnya.

In Somalia in 1995, the UN's World Food Programme was feeding 1m school children in Mogadishu. Then came the pullout by UN peacekeepers. The WFP school programme was abandoned too, due to fears for the security of the foreign aid workers. Today there are only a handful of schools across all of Somalia, since in the absence of a peace agreement the country still has neither state institutions nor funds for social services.

By blaming Africa's crises primarily on nature - ecological collapse and Aids - you fall into the same trap as so many other observers of the continent. It is this same attitude which allows the west, perhaps not unintentionally, to wash its hands of helping to resolve Africa's conflicts. In Sudan, the civil war has dragged on and off since the 1950s, yet the international community still has no coherent diplomatic policy other than to throw food aid at it, which many say serves to actually prolong the conflict. Tony Blair's government may have done more for Africa than previous ones in aid budgets and the debt relief debate, but it has no real diplomatic policy on most African conflicts. The people of the Horn did not die en masse centuries before there was ever a World Food Programme or AK-47s. But to take the example of Mozambique, the civil war, manipulated and fed with weapons by the Soviet Union, apartheid South Africa and Reagan's US, did much to weaken any potential response by local people for decades to come. Before we pat our government on the back about debt relief, let's see some real efforts by Blair to tackle even one African conflict such as Sudan - or to prevent one in a country like Zimbabwe or Kenya. Aidan Hartley London Mashur@cs.com \u0095 Poor Africa, it seems we in the west do understand the reasons behind a continent's ongoing impoverishment and desperation: a \"coincidence of crises\" - ecological disasters, malnutrition, poverty, Aids and political corruption of resources? So far, coverage of poverty in Africa is a successful record of self-deception. Today's Africa is the legacy of European historical plundering of a continent's resources, which in our contemporary world continues through a global free-market economic slave-trade, and monetary institutions which still proceed to extrapolate African finances through debt-interest repayment. Africa's political corruption by its rich elites was a slice of the colonial cake we left behind, letting the west off the hook for its crimes of impoverishment, in light of Africa's own corruption. Before we tell the world to educate its children, we might try to correctly inform ours, otherwise we proceed into the millennium as the new missionaries, bearing as much ignorance and responsibility for a continent's impoverishment as before.

You look at the Tory backbenches these days, and you see folk like Peter Lilley, Michael Howard, Norman Fowler, Ken Clarke, John Redwood and David Davis - all right, many of them the scum of the earth - but compared to Mrs Browning, political titans every one. Yet they are reduced to collecting their own toe nails, hanging round chat rooms on the web, receiving thousands in consultancy fees from various merchants of death, or whatever it is people to do fill the long, lonely hours while Mrs Browning is trying and failing to get a handle on the Rover crisis. Yesterday Martin O'Neill, the Labour chairman of the industry committee, got into trouble with the Speaker during another session on the Rover crisis. Mrs Browning has been attempting to prove that Stephen Byers, the industry secretary, knew Rover was in peril long before he told the House. She has been shuffling newspaper reports, comparing Mr Byers's statements at one time with remarks made at another time, and generally snooping round. Curtain-twitching is an important part of an opposition's job. So Mr O'Neill referred to \"the paranoia of the second-rate Miss Marple across the way\". The Speaker was outraged. \"This is not appropriate!\" she barked. Mr O'Neill said ingenuously that he thought a reference \"to one of Agatha Christie's minor detectives was appropriate\". Betty continued to bristle. \"It does cause me offence, actually,\" she said, though Mrs Browning, rather than looking affronted, merely simpered quietly to herself. I was puzzled, though I suspect that Ms Boothroyd may have been more concerned to protect Miss Marple's reputation than Mrs Browning's. After all, the fictional sleuth was intelligent, intuitive, well-informed, a mistress of detail, able to assimilate complex and often contradictory data, and generally an adornment to the place. Mrs Browning is not. Nevertheless the existing list of unparliamentary terms, which includes \"blackguard\", \"cheeky young pup\", \"Pecksniff\", \"jackass\", \"guttersnipe\", \"rat\", \"ruffian\", \"murderer\", \"swine\" and \"traitor\" is now joined by \"second-rate Miss Marple\". Of such small moments is our unwritten constitution constructed through the ages. Poor Mrs Browning had got off to an awful start. She was asking what's called a private notice question. These are usually about a subject on which the government would prefer to keep quiet, and so are a valuable way for the opposition to drag ministers into the chamber and account for themselves. Mrs Browning seemed confused. Perhaps she thought she could save time by skipping Mr Byers' reply to her unasked question, and went straight into her riposte. \"The question of Rover is becoming a question of the survival of the secretary of state!\" she announced, thus giving away her opening line. (John Redwood, who believes he should have her job, could be seen trying not to smirk.

The government's, which has betrayed Labour pledges stretching back two decades? Or the people's, who once expected FoI to be the peak not the nadir of Labour's constitutional reforms? They might not win. But a decent turn-out for principled independence would send a signal to the other place. One hesitates to urge the illegitimate Lords to do anything at all. They live and breathe democratic deficit. But being there, by grace of Mr Blair, they need every encouragement to prove they're not his poodles.",

If he wants to save money, he will have to sack actual people - not merely relabel their posts. </p> <p>Second, as Channel 5's David Elstein helpfully argued in yesterday's Media Guardian, Mr Dyke will have to be vigilant that this revamp is not the first of many. Permanent revolution ate away at the Birt BBC; Greg Dyke would do well to avoid making the same mistake.

He needs to make the structural changes begun yesterday and then leave his staff alone - allowing them to do what they do best. Not writing memos and strategy reviews but making radio we want to hear and television we want to watch.",

How they escaped and got back to earth was a sublime lesson in engineering skills, coolness under pressure, and trust in the laws of physics. </p> <p>There was a lesson in everything that happened aboard Apollo 13, and though it was mostly played out on radio, it unfolded as a kind of epic movie, on a screen a quarter of a million miles wide, and while it unfolded the entire world sat, and held its breath, and gasped at the awful starkness of it.</p> <p>A spacecraft is a kind of tiny, free-range planet. It must have air, water, recycling systems, supplies, drainage, sanitation and heating and cooling mechanisms. On planet earth - unlike Mars or Venus - the air is made up in the right proportions of gases and there is enough water to go round and the power source is the sun. On planet Apollo 13, everything depended on fuel cells. </p> <p>These fed oxygen with hydrogen to produce electricity and water in a reaction so precise you could write it on a blackboard. That was the first lesson: life is chemistry, quite literally. Inside the spacecraft were earth temperatures and pressures and it was the electricity that kept these up. Outside the spacecraft was the freezing vacuum of space, and at the first puncture of an oxygen tank, astronauts could actually see the ultracold liquid oxygen gas cascading out in the vast emptiness \"swirling in the sunlight like cigarette smoke.\" There were two lessons there: in the laws of thermodynamics and the behaviour of gases. </p> <p>There were lessons all the way for the next 300,000 miles. The force of the gas escaping wasn't very great, but Newton's laws of motion are unforgiving. The escaping oxygen acted like tiny rocket thrusters to destabilise the spacecraft and push it a little off course. The astronauts realised that the main spacecraft, Odyssey, was dying - a planet being stripped of its atmosphere - and scrambled into their \"lifeboat\": the lunar module Aquarius. </p> <p>There they began to exploit some thing else the world had learned from Newton's laws of motion and gravitational force. They fired the engine to set a course that would bypass the moon and bend around it and use the moon's gravity to throw them back to earth a little faster, and they had to get it just right. They had to get their craft into a trajectory that would not only sling them back to earth, but also have them heading towards the home planet so that they would hit the atmosphere at just the right angle. If they came in too shallow, they would bounce off the atmosphere; if they came in too steep, they would burn up. </p> <p>These things are tricky to calculate on earth, where all the sums are confounded by air resistance and friction and drag. But in the purity of space, the mathematics is true and the physics is like clockwork. A spacecraft heading round a planet in the right direction gains speed and the planet slows down proportionately. If the spacecraft is little, it gains a lot of speed and if the planet is huge, it slows down hardly at all. </p> <p>Years later, when the Voyager spacecraft flew past Jupiter, it gained 37,500 mph and Jupiter slowed down by 12 inches in about a million million years. But to make sure they had calculated right, the Apollo astronauts did what all ancient mariners once did: they had to take star sightings. Then they discovered another problem. All the bits that had blown off the spacecraft in the original explosion were still riding along with them, with sunlight reflecting from them, \"a swarm of false stars, indistinguishable from the real ones\". </p> <p> It was harder to calculate how to survive in a little lunar lander that only had very limited battery power. There was an even more pressing problem: carbon dioxide. Humans breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. With every exhalation, you create a problem of foul air. In a spaceship, you cannot open the windows. There were chemicals to \"scrub\" the carbon dioxide from the air but they were designed to cater for two men for two days, not three men for more than three days. </p> <p>Carbon dioxide kills, slowly: first, there would be terrible headaches, then hearts would begin to pound, then the three astronauts would become drowsy, and then they would sleep, and quietly asphyxiate. The world held its breath while the astronauts, fatigued, cold and dehydrated, followed ground control instructions to turn two lithium hydroxide canisters from the mothership, some cardboard from a flightplan book, two plastic storage bags and some grey tape into a makeshift air purifier. </p> <p>When the three men got back into the main ship as they approached earth, the vessel was at refrigerator temperature: so cold that all their breath had condensed in it, and even the instrument panel was dripping. When the spacecraft splashed down safely and gently, in the warmth of the South Pacific, Navy divers opened the doors and a great cloud of frosty air flew out into the tropical morning: inside the spacecraft, the chill of space lingered on. Every hour of the drama was a new demonstration in the stark, life-or-death, down-to-earth urgency of science. </p> <p>Last week, the National Space Science Centre in Leicester conducted a survey of 1,026 children aged 10 to 13. Four out of five thought science at school was boring; 15% thought biology the only aspect of any interest, and 90% criticised the way they were taught. Only one child in 14 wanted to take up a career in science. However, there was a twist to all this: 43% of the children would like to be astronauts, compared with 23% who wanted to be a footballer and 20% who would prefer to be a fashion model. Some 65% wanted to see some form of space science introduced into the classroom. And 99% knew that the first man on the moon was Neil Armstrong. </p> <p>The comments of the kids themselves were fairly withering. \"The experiments are good but the teachers going on and on is dead boring,\" said one 12-year-old boy, and a 10-year-old said: \"Science is really boring. It's equations, writing long words, body parts and bad smells. I don't mind experiments but I hate recording results.\" </p> <p>A girl of 12 said \"Complicated - all about atoms and everything. I don't know a lot about science. I sometimes like the experiments in science because you never know what is going to happen.\" </p> <p>But a boy of 12 said: \"Space is exciting.

However, it contradicted his appearance: a jacket hanging loose on his frail shoulders, his voice was at times barely audible.</p> <p>As commander of the SLA, Israel's main ally in its self-styled security zone, Gen Lahad and his 2,600 men have much to consider when the 18-year occupation comes to an end.

      "bodyText": "A South Lebanese Army general sentenced to death in Beirut for aiding the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon, yesterday vowed to fight to the bloody end when his paymasters withdraw in the weeks ahead. With no sign of a wider peace deal with Syria, it is becoming increasingly likely that Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon will be conducted under fire, a prospect that could destabilise the entire region and leave Israel's allies in the country open to reprisal attacks. \"I thought of leaving,\" General Antoine Lahad, commander of the South Lebanese Army (SLA), said from this Israeli border town. \"But I am staying there no matter how bad it gets.\" Although the general is believed to have secured his escape - to his residence in Paris - yesterday he put on an air of bravado for his men in the hopes of forestalling a wider exodus. However, it contradicted his appearance: a jacket hanging loose on his frail shoulders, his voice was at times barely audible. As commander of the SLA, Israel's main ally in its self-styled security zone, Gen Lahad and his 2,600 men have much to consider when the 18-year occupation comes to an end. So too do the people of Metulla have much to fear. Come early July, when the Israeli soldiers are scheduled to depart, the red-tiled roofs of this hamlet will once again be under the guns of whichever force rules - the Syrian-backed Hizbullah guerrillas, the Lebanese army, or most improbably, the SLA. \"Before 1982, it was a hell here,\" said Miriam Hod, who owns a guest house in Metulla. \"I had two little children and almost all year we were in the shelters underground.\" She points out the window, to the hill that rises beyond the peach and date trees at the bottom of her garden. \"Do you see that road there?

Even the absolutely unsentimental Chris Woodhead was struck by the warmth of everyday routine at the Sheffield comprehensive - the world of Bleeper Man and children facing crushing poverty that riveted Guardian readers when Nick Davies described it last year.</p> <p>Then - while the Grange's head, Jan Woodhead (no relation), was still savouring the word \"warmth\" which is central to the school's ethos - the VIP visitor was back on more familiar rails. In a clearly thought out and well managed structure, he said, he had spent the morning watching some very good teaching at work. </p> <p>\"That's what makes the difference,\" he said, giving the phrase \"very good teaching\" the same deliberate emphasis he had given \"warmth\". \"It is a testament to dedication and hard work.\" </p> <p>In under two hours, the head of Ofsted had absorbed - like his 12 colleagues who inspected the school in the week Nick Davies' articles were published last September - what many people in the neat but nervous suburbs round the comprehensive still fail to see. </p> <p>Within minutes of his arrival, he was taking tea in the library with three pupils whose maths, and in one case French, GCSEs were under their belts either one or two years early.

      "bodyText": "The chief inspector of schools went straight to the point as usual - but with one small, telling deviation as he paused in a corridor to sum up his impressions of Abbeydale Grange. Even the absolutely unsentimental Chris Woodhead was struck by the warmth of everyday routine at the Sheffield comprehensive - the world of Bleeper Man and children facing crushing poverty that riveted Guardian readers when Nick Davies described it last year. Then - while the Grange's head, Jan Woodhead (no relation), was still savouring the word \"warmth\" which is central to the school's ethos - the VIP visitor was back on more familiar rails. In a clearly thought out and well managed structure, he said, he had spent the morning watching some very good teaching at work. \"That's what makes the difference,\" he said, giving the phrase \"very good teaching\" the same deliberate emphasis he had given \"warmth\". \"It is a testament to dedication and hard work.\" In under two hours, the head of Ofsted had absorbed - like his 12 colleagues who inspected the school in the week Nick Davies' articles were published last September - what many people in the neat but nervous suburbs round the comprehensive still fail to see. Within minutes of his arrival, he was taking tea in the library with three pupils whose maths, and in one case French, GCSEs were under their belts either one or two years early. The only faux pas was a moment of teenage nerves that sent a couple of biscuits wobbling to the floor. What did the children say about the school? asked the chief inspector. They liked it, they replied politely. They got a quick response when they raised anything with teachers. They would like more computers, books and everything else.

      "byline": "Phil Revell",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>For over a hundred Merseyside teenagers, their last year of schooling involves work-based training, taster courses at the local further education college, personal development courses - and one or two days a week at school. The preparation for work and training courses are offered to pupils at risk of exclusion in their final year. Some will be long-term absentees, others have behaviour problems and all are part of the rising tide of disaffection that has overtaken inner-city schools since the introduction of the national curriculum. </p> <p>\"They're a mixed bunch,\" says Dave Morgan, whose Knowsley Compact runs the course, \"who don't like schools and don't like teachers.\" </p> <p>Knowsley is one of the most deprived boroughs in the UK. If the experience of other inner-city areas is anything to go by, Knowsley exclusion rates ought to be sky-high. </p> <p>\"We haven't had a permanent exclusion for two years,\" says Brendan McLoughlin, headteacher at All Saints Roman Catholic School. And that goes for the other 11 comprehensives in the borough. </p> <p>\"Permanent exclusions are now down to zero,\" says the director of education, Peter Wylie. He believes the answer lies in early intervention. In Knowsley, that can take the form of educational support units, where pupils at risk of exclusion can be supported until they are ready to return to mainstream schooling, or a radically alternative diet of work, training and support. </p> <p>Students on the programme are \"disapplied\" from the national curriculum, which involves dropping two of their eight subjects. Over 600 schools nationwide have applied to the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to disapply some pupils. Last year, nearly 9,000 pupils followed such a slimmed-down curriculum. </p> <p>Schools promise to squeeze the remaining six subjects into the one or two days that children are present. But the QCA doesn't police this and, for many, the reality is that normal schooling ends as soon as they are put onto the programme. </p> <p>\"These kids have the potential to take up a lot of the school's time,\" says Gerry Bedford at Knowsley High. \"But that doesn't mean we should just abandon them.\" Bedford argues that it's about priorities, earmarking some money to keep the youngsters in touch with their education. </p> <p>Eighteen-year-old Charlene is one of the project's successes, having gone on to college to do qualifications in hairdressing and beauty therapy. \"I have strong ideas of what I want to do,\" she says. \"Some of school was all right.

      "bodyText": "For over a hundred Merseyside teenagers, their last year of schooling involves work-based training, taster courses at the local further education college, personal development courses - and one or two days a week at school. The preparation for work and training courses are offered to pupils at risk of exclusion in their final year. Some will be long-term absentees, others have behaviour problems and all are part of the rising tide of disaffection that has overtaken inner-city schools since the introduction of the national curriculum. \"They're a mixed bunch,\" says Dave Morgan, whose Knowsley Compact runs the course, \"who don't like schools and don't like teachers.\" Knowsley is one of the most deprived boroughs in the UK. If the experience of other inner-city areas is anything to go by, Knowsley exclusion rates ought to be sky-high. \"We haven't had a permanent exclusion for two years,\" says Brendan McLoughlin, headteacher at All Saints Roman Catholic School. And that goes for the other 11 comprehensives in the borough. \"Permanent exclusions are now down to zero,\" says the director of education, Peter Wylie. He believes the answer lies in early intervention. In Knowsley, that can take the form of educational support units, where pupils at risk of exclusion can be supported until they are ready to return to mainstream schooling, or a radically alternative diet of work, training and support. Students on the programme are \"disapplied\" from the national curriculum, which involves dropping two of their eight subjects. Over 600 schools nationwide have applied to the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to disapply some pupils. Last year, nearly 9,000 pupils followed such a slimmed-down curriculum. Schools promise to squeeze the remaining six subjects into the one or two days that children are present. But the QCA doesn't police this and, for many, the reality is that normal schooling ends as soon as they are put onto the programme. \"These kids have the potential to take up a lot of the school's time,\" says Gerry Bedford at Knowsley High. \"But that doesn't mean we should just abandon them.\" Bedford argues that it's about priorities, earmarking some money to keep the youngsters in touch with their education. Eighteen-year-old Charlene is one of the project's successes, having gone on to college to do qualifications in hairdressing and beauty therapy. \"I have strong ideas of what I want to do,\" she says. \"Some of school was all right. I wanted qualifications, but they didn't have them in what I was interested in.\" A local employer who offers work experience to young people from the project is positive about the scheme. \"I'm the son of a docker and proud of it,\" says Eric Mahoney. \"These kids are in the same position I was in when I left school at 15 with no qualifications.

      "body": "<p>Last week, an unprecedented scientific meeting took place at the Royal Society between particle physicists, biologists, environmental climatologists and computer scientists. The subject of the discussion: a computing \"grid\" that some predict will be the next generation of technology on the world wide web.</p> <p>One day, they believe, the grid will offer scientists computing power 100 times the capacity of today's supercomputers. It will help decode the explosion of data emerging on a range of scientific fronts. </p> <p>The grid will provide a common solution to the computing needs of different scientific problems: from the atom-smashing experiments at Cern, to the output of sequencing data from the human genome project, to the modelling of the world's weather systems. This is the vision, at least, at the heart of one of the bids for science funding in the Whitehall spending review. According to some government sources, the Office of Science and Technology has requested \u00a3100m over the next three years to support a concerted programme to help develop the grid, and improve the productivity of the country's science effort. </p> <p>But many believe there is more at stake than improving the research tools of the scientific community. If the UK fails to participate in the international scientific information race, it may be excluded from future scientific developments altogether. </p> <p>And despite the government's efforts to promote the UK as a hotbed for e-commerce and knowledge-driven companies, there are signs that UK industrialists will once more miss out on the technological innovations which will underpin the successful businesses of the future. </p> <p>The key to the computing grid is software, or \"middleware\", which allows the computer user to extract information from a network of distributed computing resources. The concept of the grid is that you set a PC an intelligent task - an astronomer may request data on a galaxy, and current research - and the grid enables software tools to interrogate any relevant database. </p> <p>\"You don't know where the data is, you don't even necessarily need to worry about the CPU [central processing unit]. The grid will pull data from a variety of databases and formats, some of it live from satellites or telescopes, other bits from archives,\" says Jim Sadlier, who is coordinating the grid initiative for the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council. The director general of research councils, John Taylor, science minister David Sainsbury and e-commerce minister Patricia Hewitt have shown growing interest in this vision of \"e-science\". </p> <p>But the problem for the UK science community is that it is several steps behind the US in the scientific information race.

      "bodyText": "Last week, an unprecedented scientific meeting took place at the Royal Society between particle physicists, biologists, environmental climatologists and computer scientists. The subject of the discussion: a computing \"grid\" that some predict will be the next generation of technology on the world wide web. One day, they believe, the grid will offer scientists computing power 100 times the capacity of today's supercomputers. It will help decode the explosion of data emerging on a range of scientific fronts. The grid will provide a common solution to the computing needs of different scientific problems: from the atom-smashing experiments at Cern, to the output of sequencing data from the human genome project, to the modelling of the world's weather systems. This is the vision, at least, at the heart of one of the bids for science funding in the Whitehall spending review. According to some government sources, the Office of Science and Technology has requested \u00a3100m over the next three years to support a concerted programme to help develop the grid, and improve the productivity of the country's science effort. But many believe there is more at stake than improving the research tools of the scientific community. If the UK fails to participate in the international scientific information race, it may be excluded from future scientific developments altogether. And despite the government's efforts to promote the UK as a hotbed for e-commerce and knowledge-driven companies, there are signs that UK industrialists will once more miss out on the technological innovations which will underpin the successful businesses of the future. The key to the computing grid is software, or \"middleware\", which allows the computer user to extract information from a network of distributed computing resources. The concept of the grid is that you set a PC an intelligent task - an astronomer may request data on a galaxy, and current research - and the grid enables software tools to interrogate any relevant database. \"You don't know where the data is, you don't even necessarily need to worry about the CPU [central processing unit]. The grid will pull data from a variety of databases and formats, some of it live from satellites or telescopes, other bits from archives,\" says Jim Sadlier, who is coordinating the grid initiative for the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council. The director general of research councils, John Taylor, science minister David Sainsbury and e-commerce minister Patricia Hewitt have shown growing interest in this vision of \"e-science\". But the problem for the UK science community is that it is several steps behind the US in the scientific information race. Up to now, the grid has been developed almost exclusively by US researchers. And since their atom-accelerator programme was cancelled, US particle physicists have been clear about how they intend to exploit their computing prowess: creaming off all the best physics from the experiments. \"If the UK does not buy into its part of the particle physics computational grid now, we will not even be in the game - and the only thing that we in the UK could do in the future is send our scientists abroad,\" says Paul Jeffreys, from the Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils. But it is not just leading edge science at stake. If the grid follows the precedent set by the world wide web, academics and businesses closest to the new technology now are those most likely to translate it into future commercial applications. The success of the e-science bid is likely to rest on whether Treasury officials are convinced it can secure a brighter future for UK plc.",

How much culpability Bristol, and indeed all Britain, shared with the US was one of the key Anglo-American issues thrashed out by students at two institutions in a three-month-long transatlantic conference.

While the theme of slavery was one all of the participants settled on happily enough, the perspectives of the two groups of students were often at odds. Yes, it was agreed, there had certainly been a mutual involvement of the Americans and British in the slave trade and slavery generally. But the American students were quick to argue that slavery was introduced by the British while the North American colonies were still part of the old empire, and that the British introduced slavery into their Caribbean colonies too. </p> <p> On the other hand, the Exeter students pointed out that England abolished slavery in the empire in 1833 and without a civil war. \"But more than anything,\" says Bardaglio, \"as the debate unfolded, both the Goucher students and the Exeter students came to realise the complexity of the past and the ways in which people on both sides of the Atlantic blinded themselves to the wrongs that they were doing in the name of commerce and profit.\" </p> <p>Bardaglio is no stranger to this kind of teaching. An earlier course he taught in America on the cold-war era required its students to add to their usual classroom activities by using the internet as a discussion medium.

      "bodyText": "Tory leader William Hague's former right hand man is accusing the Further Education Funding Council of forcing through a misguided merger between his local college and a bigger institution. Alan Duncan launched a stinging attack in parliament on the proposed fusion of Rutland sixth-form college, which is in his constituency, and Tresham College in Northamptonshire, a bigger general further education institution 23 miles away. The deal was going ahead against massive popular opposition, he claimed. Using Commons privilege, Hague's former parliamentary political secre tary named and berated the funding council's east-midlands official, Christine Frost, saying: \"...her apparently unbending agenda amounts to questionable conduct.\" The funding council completely rejected Duncan's accusations. His attack was launched as the funding council published a report urging college heads and governors to think more about mergers. According to the report, David Blunkett wants the funding council to be \"proactive in encouraging mergers\". And it admits that the council may make merger a condition of continuing funding for colleges in serious financial straits. Rutland college was going ahead with its plan to merge with Tresham, simply to avoid a predicted \u00a3100,000 deficit next year, Duncan told the Commons. There was no link between the two institutions and \"no educational rationale for the merger\". Last year only three students from Rutland went to Tresham college and there was \"no natural link\" between Rutland and Northants. \"The merger is ill-conceived, ill-timed and ill-considered,\" he said. The \"compelling\" merger for the stricken sixth-form college, which has 400 full-time students, would be with Stamford College, 12 miles away in Lincolnshire, Duncan said. Two hundred full-time students already travel from Rutland to Stamford, and the two towns will come under the same local Learning and Skills Council. \"I am profoundly disturbed by the attitude of funding council officials, who are so bent on forcing the merger through that they have chosen to ignore all contrary points of view,\" he said. \"The truth is, I have never seen such a blatant case of bureaucratic bulldozing.\" A funding council spokesman said: \"The process has been carried out very thoroughly and quite properly. \"It's followed through the well-publicised and critical regime of presentation, consultation and assessment which has been tried and tested over a number of mergers.\" John Glazier, Rutland college principal, said it would have to shed a quarter of its 32 full-time staff if it didn't merge - \"not a sensible option\". Tresham was committed to developing the \"sixth form college type education\", he said. He denied significant local opposition to the merger. Only one member of the public turned up to a meeting about the merger held by the local authority, he said.

In his annual lecture, given at the end of last month, HM's Chief Inspector of Schools suggested that self-improvement was beyond the masses and that plumbers should just knuckle down and carry on plumbing. By the same token, fairground workers should presumably stay in their caravans. Except not all of them are. David Wynn, James Jones and Shaun Weightman, all of whom have been working the fairs since they were 14 and don't have a single academic qualification between them, are all studying for NVQs in fabrication and welding at Chesterfield College. </p> <p>The story begins two years ago when Wynn, who, much to Woodhead's relief no doubt, can neither read nor write, reckoned that it was about time he had his skills certified. \"I was born to the fairgrounds,\" he says, \"so I've never known anything else. I learned welding both from my Dad and by helping out at the local blacksmith, and I used to muck in making candy-floss stalls and adapting lorries to accommodate the rides.\" </p> <p>It was all low-risk stuff, but the jobs needed doing, and Wynn fell in love with welding. \"I love the power of designing something and making it myself,\" he adds. In recent years, though, times have got a lot harder on the fairgrounds. The once lucrative summer season has become the slackest time of year, thanks to the big theme parks, such as Alton Towers, and to more people taking holidays abroad,\" says Wynn, with a half-smile. </p> <p>In addition to all this, the Health and Safety regulations have quite rightly been tightened; each ride has to be rigorously tested to make sure it is safe. This does not come cheap: it can cost \u00a3250 to get a ride tested and if faults are found, a welder who has been certificated to work at a certain level must be brought in to do the repairs. This can run to \u00a320-30 per hour. </p> <p>With income falling and costs rising, you don't have to be a genius to see the attraction of getting qualifications. Initially, Wynn had no response when he enquired about welding courses at Mansfield College. But he got lucky when a teacher who visits the Selston caravan site to take classes for the fairground children, including Wynn's two sons, approached Chesterfield College on his behalf. Within a day Wynn had had a reply. </p> <p>Dave Glossop is the course lecturer in fabrication and welding. \"David was only going to be at his caravan site for 16 weeks of the year,\" he says, \" and he wanted a course that would fit in to this time frame. Our normal courses last twice as long, but I reckoned that if he was prepared to do two full days a week, instead of the normal one, we could accommodate him.\" </p> <p>Last year Wynn completed his Awarding Body Consortium (ABC) 165 scheme in flat welding. This year he has come back to take the more complex, horizontal welding and next year he intends to get his overhead qualification. Wynn has also come back mob handed, with Jones and Weightman who are taking the flat welding course. </p> <p>\"I've been working the fairs for 15 years and it's much harder to earn a living these days,\" Jones says candidly. Like Wynn, he is looking for the reassurance of a qualification. \"There's a good chance that if you've got the paperwork to back up your welding, you can keep working all year long. You can do work for other showmen as well as looking after your own rides.\" </p> <p>But even though Wynn and Jones say they know the stresses and strains of their rides better than any outsider, there are always going to be limits to how much repair work they will be able to do. \"Some of the big computerised modern rides cost over \u00a31m,\" says Wynn, \"and if anything goes wrong the manufacturer guarantees to fix it. The rides are so safe these days, you've got more chance of being killed while setting them up than you have of being killed on them.\" Which presumably makes the computer course the logical next step for the men, Chris Woodhead permitting.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fill in the gaps in the following sentences. Revision is (boring/laborious/difficult). If I could do it on the web it would be (easier/more interesting/absolutely thrilling). Not difficult, and not a great leap of imagination for educational publishers, who have spotted a captive market of bored teenagers who never want to see (or pay for) a Letts revision guide or York Notes crib again. From the excellence of the BBC to the excruciatingly poor content of www.a-levels.com, revision sites are booming. But not everyone thinks web-based revision is a good thing. \"If it means the kids will do some revision, that would be good,\" says David Jones, author of the Teach Yourself Revise GCSE Geography and a forthcoming A-level title. \"But the novelty would wear off pretty smartish. The problems you have in writing material for all syllabuses would make it incredibly difficult. I don't see it as a revision tool.\" A-level learning, at least in the arts, is as much about constructing an argument and gathering evidence as learning facts - something which no interactive program has yet been able to test. \"What the web is good for is those times when you're going through your notes and find something's missing,\" says Jones. \"A list of useful websites would be better than online revision at this level.\" But revision starts much earlier now, and parents are worrying about their child's performance in SATs as well as GCSEs and A levels. Little wonder that they send anguished emails to the BBC's revision website fearing they are too strict, too lax or even too stupid to help. These resources are among the most comprehensive and best written on the web. Commendably, the BBC is also urging 10- and 11-year-olds to join free revision clubs at weekends in April. Other sites are trying hard to catch up. SAM Learning offers a limited, sometimes somewhat antiquated range of tests (Female jobs in French? How about secretary and waitress?)

      "byline": "Kate Clanchy",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b> Week 18 </b> <p> This morning I lost sight of my knickers. They have disappeared beneath the dome of my belly. This has never happened to me before, stout though I have been, and I find it alarming. After all, my body hasn't sprouted in the night since I was 15, and the consequences then were unspeakable. </p> <p>I'd like to know when, exactly, it all intends to stop. This is the sort of question that sends me to the wall of pregnancy books in Waterstone's. The trouble is, there are so many answers. Dr Gordon Bourne, author of Pregnancy, the 20-year-old multi-selling bible on the subject, seems obsessed with weight gain, returning to it in nearly every chapter and providing strict and very slender tables. </p> <p>Bourne quotes with approval the story of the woman who vomited so much through her pregnancy that she lost nearly 100 pounds (\"she was still a little overweight!\"). He provides diets that will allow every woman to look \"just as nice in her bikini\" three months after birth, but regrets the feminine ignorance that so often undermines his advice. \"Most women on a diet tend to nibble between meals, especially cheese. It is not generally realised that cheese will cause an increase in weight. Its intake should be strictly limited.\" But then, Dr Bourne also calls nappies \"napkins\", and thinks episiotomies should be routine. </p> <p>Miriam Stoppard Woman is much more progressive. She rises smoothly though a table of average weight gain, smiling Mona Lisa-like and keeping up her iron intake the while, and is even permitted a moment of body anxiety when she contemplates her stomach dubiously in a white dressing gown. Nothing about knickers, though. </p> <p>Meanwhile, downmarket, Emma, author of the \"Diary\" issued free to every pregnant woman by the Royal College of General Practitioners, manages to record, \"I can expect to gain anything from 9.6-19.2 kg (20-40lb)\" - without panicking for an instant. Imagine Bridget Jones faced with such a prospect. But Emma is odd in many ways. She writes all weights down like that, in pounds and kilograms, says \"pass water\" instead of \"pee\", and has never noticed that her friend Paula is black. Emma also never reads the paper. You can tell because not once in her diary does she get upset by articles that advise you to \"just buy a skirt a size larger than usual, and emphasise your slim arms with Agnes B tops\". </p> <p>Emma, therefore, has never had to wonder what to do if you always buy the largest size in the shop anyway and can only fit in the curtains in Agnes B. No, Emma just trots off to Mothercare and picks up a floral tent, for she is sweetly unaware of the rise of the pregnant media star. </p> <p>If Emma had ever seen Carol Smillie, Posh Spice, or the two pregnant All Saints, she would realise that frocks are out and that tight tops and leggings with a pneumatic bulge in the middle are in. The look is not so much Ceres as python-that-has-recently-swallowed-a-sheep. On these women, you can tell what is python and what is sheep. Or rather, what is taut, personally trained muscle and what is soon to be caesareaned, clip-off baby. </p> <p>These women, the python look tells us, will soon return to their sexual, available selves while the baby giggles elsewhere in a basket. They are laughing, prancing evidence that motherhood is no problem and certainly doesn't require a revolution in child care. No wonder Miriam Stoppard Woman - and I am she, undoubtedly, though in a dirtier dressing gown - looks so worried. She used to march for Wages for Housework. </p> <p> T he thing is, I have never looked like a python, and I don't think my baby is clip-off, either. Already, I have pulled my pelvic bones out of alignment getting on my bicycle, and had to have them clicked back together by my osteopath, who, fortunately, is a genius. He told me gently that my pelvis was in sections, and that the ligaments stretch when you're pregnant. I didn't know. </p> <p>It makes me think that birth may be more like splitting in two. I suspect, too,that I may not see my knickers again for many, many months, and may soon lose my toes. Fortunately, I have Emma as my heroine. Emma, busting in every diary entry out of bras, waistbands, jeans, oblivious to Dr Bourne and the Cheese Menace, to Miriam's relentless sensibleness, to the post-feminist python sirens. Emma with her straight forward delivery - just gas and air! - her years off work, her rapidly fading stretchmarks. Hurrah for Emma and baby Lucy-Kate. I think I'll skip Waterstone's. I'm off to buy a tent.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Week 18 This morning I lost sight of my knickers. They have disappeared beneath the dome of my belly. This has never happened to me before, stout though I have been, and I find it alarming. After all, my body hasn't sprouted in the night since I was 15, and the consequences then were unspeakable. I'd like to know when, exactly, it all intends to stop. This is the sort of question that sends me to the wall of pregnancy books in Waterstone's. The trouble is, there are so many answers. Dr Gordon Bourne, author of Pregnancy, the 20-year-old multi-selling bible on the subject, seems obsessed with weight gain, returning to it in nearly every chapter and providing strict and very slender tables. Bourne quotes with approval the story of the woman who vomited so much through her pregnancy that she lost nearly 100 pounds (\"she was still a little overweight!\"). He provides diets that will allow every woman to look \"just as nice in her bikini\" three months after birth, but regrets the feminine ignorance that so often undermines his advice. \"Most women on a diet tend to nibble between meals, especially cheese. It is not generally realised that cheese will cause an increase in weight. Its intake should be strictly limited.\" But then, Dr Bourne also calls nappies \"napkins\", and thinks episiotomies should be routine. Miriam Stoppard Woman is much more progressive. She rises smoothly though a table of average weight gain, smiling Mona Lisa-like and keeping up her iron intake the while, and is even permitted a moment of body anxiety when she contemplates her stomach dubiously in a white dressing gown. Nothing about knickers, though. Meanwhile, downmarket, Emma, author of the \"Diary\" issued free to every pregnant woman by the Royal College of General Practitioners, manages to record, \"I can expect to gain anything from 9.6-19.2 kg (20-40lb)\" - without panicking for an instant. Imagine Bridget Jones faced with such a prospect. But Emma is odd in many ways. She writes all weights down like that, in pounds and kilograms, says \"pass water\" instead of \"pee\", and has never noticed that her friend Paula is black. Emma also never reads the paper. You can tell because not once in her diary does she get upset by articles that advise you to \"just buy a skirt a size larger than usual, and emphasise your slim arms with Agnes B tops\". Emma, therefore, has never had to wonder what to do if you always buy the largest size in the shop anyway and can only fit in the curtains in Agnes B. No, Emma just trots off to Mothercare and picks up a floral tent, for she is sweetly unaware of the rise of the pregnant media star. If Emma had ever seen Carol Smillie, Posh Spice, or the two pregnant All Saints, she would realise that frocks are out and that tight tops and leggings with a pneumatic bulge in the middle are in. The look is not so much Ceres as python-that-has-recently-swallowed-a-sheep. On these women, you can tell what is python and what is sheep. Or rather, what is taut, personally trained muscle and what is soon to be caesareaned, clip-off baby. These women, the python look tells us, will soon return to their sexual, available selves while the baby giggles elsewhere in a basket. They are laughing, prancing evidence that motherhood is no problem and certainly doesn't require a revolution in child care. No wonder Miriam Stoppard Woman - and I am she, undoubtedly, though in a dirtier dressing gown - looks so worried. She used to march for Wages for Housework. T he thing is, I have never looked like a python, and I don't think my baby is clip-off, either. Already, I have pulled my pelvic bones out of alignment getting on my bicycle, and had to have them clicked back together by my osteopath, who, fortunately, is a genius. He told me gently that my pelvis was in sections, and that the ligaments stretch when you're pregnant. I didn't know. It makes me think that birth may be more like splitting in two. I suspect, too,that I may not see my knickers again for many, many months, and may soon lose my toes. Fortunately, I have Emma as my heroine. Emma, busting in every diary entry out of bras, waistbands, jeans, oblivious to Dr Bourne and the Cheese Menace, to Miriam's relentless sensibleness, to the post-feminist python sirens. Emma with her straight forward delivery - just gas and air! - her years off work, her rapidly fading stretchmarks. Hurrah for Emma and baby Lucy-Kate. I think I'll skip Waterstone's. I'm off to buy a tent.",

Of the four men who were in the building, one was found within minutes of the accident. The 38-year-old, who had been on the top floor, was protected by a tunnel formed by falling masonry and escaped with cuts and bruises. The remaining three had not been located after a second collapse, prompting health and safety officers to rule the area too unstable for the 45 firefighters involved. Earlier rescue efforts at the site, in the city centre, were hampered when gale force winds affected the sensitivity of sound detection equipment. Nick Granger, of Humberside fire service, said the search had been further complicated because of uncertainty about the workmen's location. \"By the time we can restart the search effort they will have been under the debris for over 24-hours - you have to fear the worst,\" he said. \"What we are hoping is that they are trapped in the basement in a cavity somewhere and it is always possible they are relatively unharmed.

Elaine Trego, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, denies murdering her son, Jacob Rowlands, in February 1999. The child was taken to hospital after Trego's nine-year-old daughter Melissa alerted neighbours, but doctors could not save him, John Royce QC, prosecuting, said. Trego told doctors and detectives that Jacob fell on to the floor from a settee, and had convulsions when she shook him to try to revive him. But Mr Royce said a postmortem showed that Jacob had 12 areas of bruising to his head and face, and bruising on other parts of his body. There was also a build-up of blood around one of his optic nerves and further haemorrhaging under the skull. \"The degree of trauma was greater, according to the doctor, than would have been caused by falling off a settee and on to the floor,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "Millionaire chef Marco Pierre White yesterday told a high court libel jury that he had never taken drugs and rarely drank, despite claims in two American newspapers that he had had a \"well-publicised bout with drugs and alcohol\" Mr White is claiming libel damages for an article published in both the New York Times and the International Herald Tribune, which are contesting the case and claim the article had caused no damage and had even \"enchanced\" the chef's reputation. His counsel, George Carman QC, said the celebrity restaurateur was \"shocked and very, very upset and angry\" when he read the accusations two years ago and had been \"distressed\" by private investigators hired by the newspapers to \"dig up dirt\" on him. Mr White, 38, waited to give evidence in the London court room with his Spanish fiancee, Mati Conejero, and fellow chef Gordon Ramsay, as Mr Carman outlined his case to the jury and Mr Justice Morland. The court heard that the chef was a dyslexic school drop-out from a Leeds council estate who had arrived in London at the age of 19 with only \u00a37.36 in his pocket but had worked up to 18 hours a day, six or seven days a week for many years to win his first Michelin star in 1988. Mr Carman said: \"He is probably the most outstanding and distinguished restaurateur and chef this country has produced in the last 25 years.\" Although starting from \"the most humble beginnings in life\", the chef had had a \"glittering career\" through \"a combination of immense talent, virtually unremitting hard work, ambition and complete passion\", Mr Carman told the court. He said Mr White was the youngest chef to obtain three Michelin stars in 1995, and he was in addition the \"only Englishman to be so honoured in the entire gastronomic world\". The court heard that the \"bombshell\" sentence in the otherwise favourable article published in May 1998 by American journalist, Florence Fabricant, claimed that \"beneath Mr White's rock star veneer, including a well publicised bout with drugs and alcohol, lies a very savvy and rich businessman\". Mr Carman said: \"That statement is not only untrue and totally false, but it is accepted by these two newspapers to be false and completely untrue.\" Mr White said he had never taken drugs and \"very, very rarely\" drank an occasional glass of wine, but never spirits. His mother had died when he was six, he said, and he believed that his father was an alcoholic, adding: \"I saw the destruction it caused in the family.\" The father of three also said he had concerns about his young children getting involved with drugs. \"I object to drugs. It's something that I totally disapprove of,\" he added. Under cross-examination by George Robertson QC, for the defence, Mr White denied he was rich or lived \"a rock star's life style\". Earlier, Mr Carman said that Ms Fabricant's reference to drink and drugs was based on an \"ambigious passage\" in Mr White's autobiography. Despite immediate requests for a retraction and apology from Mr White's solicitors, the New York Times went on to syndicate the article to the International Herald Tribune. He said the chef had felt harassed by the newspapers which, the court heard, had hired private investigators to \"dig\" into his background to get any \"dirt\" on him - any stories of \"sex and drugs and rock and roll\". Shortly before the trial, the court heard, the newspapers withdrew their defence of justification and now relied on the argument that the article did not lower Mr White's reputation and was in fact \"very positive\" about him. They had, Mr Carman said, accused Mr White of being \"greedy\" in seeking \"large\" damages. The case continues.",

      "bodyText": "A former salesman who claimed to be \"the friendly face of home shopping\" was yesterday given two life sentences for the murder of a dog breeder and her mother. Kevin Cotterell used the slogan while visiting homes across Norfolk and Cambridgeshire for a kitchenware firm, Kleeneze, before his apparently motiveless killing of the two women. Janice Sheridan, 45, was found by neighbours stabbed once in the back, twice in the neck, and six times in the chest. Her mother, Connie, 79, died on a sofa a few feet away with eight stab wounds to her chest, one to her stomach and one to her forearm. At Norwich crown court yesterday, Cotterell, 33, switched his not guilty plea and admitted killing the pair at their cottage in Upwell, Norfolk. He refused to explain why he committed the murders. Afterwards, Miss Sheridan's half-sister, Diana Penfold, who lives in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, said she was \"devastated\" at Cotterell's guilty plea.\"We we just want to know why. We were hoping that we might get some answers during the trial but we still don't know.\" Detectives suspect Cotterell killed the women and then spent the night with their bodies. Detective Inspector Paul Chapman, who led the investigation, said: \"He is clearly wicked and evil beyond belief.\" Cotterell, of Pentney, Norfolk, had previous convictions for burglaries - one of which involved an indecent act - for which he was given 12 months probation in 1983. Detectives were last night trying to establish whether he could be linked to other murders or sex crimes during the past two decades. Det Insp Chapman said: \"The view of the psychological profiler that we used is that it is very strange for anyone to progress from burglary to murder in the way that Cotterell has.\"",

I was later to discover from my own research, which Fayed and his lawyers knew absolutely nothing about, that the DTI report was the result of a ruthlessly vindictive smear campaign by the late Tiny Rowland.

Two newspapers have previously reported at some length, and in sensational terms, allegations that Fayed improperly influenced police officers to either arrest or at least interview former employees with whom he had had disagreements. These allegations in the press also formed the basis of much of the cross-examination of Fayed during the Hamilton trial. That cross-examination was itself widely reported in the press.

That did not deter malicious voices in the media from continuing to quote from the report to fuel their hatred of the Fayeds.</p> <p>I n August 1997 the terrible car crash in Paris pitched Mohamed Al Fayed into a bitter conflict with the British establishment that will not be resolved until there is a comprehensive account of many still unexplained aspects of the tragedy.

I shall mention just a few.</p> <p>How could the blood test that was so discredited by serious medical commentators in the US, Britain and elsewhere in Europe be taken seriously as evidence that the driver was drunk? CCTV showed him sober. Why did the ambulance take one hour and 43 minutes to travel 3.8 miles to a small hospital run by nuns, passing at least three major hospitals with functioning accident and emergency units on the way? Why did the French police drop their search for a Fiat Uno proven by paint samples to have col lided in the tunnel with the Mercedes? Did British officials intervene at the autopsy as the respected American investigative journalist Gerald Posner claims they did? Why did the British security service deny their own presence in Paris when two of their senior officers answered telephone calls in the British embassy at the time? If parliament refuses to inquire into these and other key questions and damaging factual evidence trickles out later, we shall be seen to have failed in our responsibilities.</p> <p>Most people in this country have made up their minds about Mohamed Al Fayed, Dodi and Diana, and the fatal car crash. Anti-Fayed media onslaughts do not seem to budge their scepticism about what happened. Yet a few very senior journalists, a handful of Metropolitan police officers with known links to the security service and a motley band of political ankle-biters together form the immovable object opposed to Mohamed Al Fayed's unstoppable force.</p> <p>Two newspaper editors dining in early 1997 swore they would have Fayed out of the country by the end of that year. How wrong they were. What do they fear? I am not a betting man, but if I were, I should say that ultimately salaried editors, an increasingly ragged security service and today's soft-centred establishment will prove no match for the determination of a very angry, rich man, who will leave no stone unturned to get at the truth and has not the slightest interest in middle-class pretensions. I like him.</p> <p>Charles Wardle is the Conservative MP for Bexhill and Battle</p>",

Why did the British security service deny their own presence in Paris when two of their senior officers answered telephone calls in the British embassy at the time? If parliament refuses to inquire into these and other key questions and damaging factual evidence trickles out later, we shall be seen to have failed in our responsibilities. Most people in this country have made up their minds about Mohamed Al Fayed, Dodi and Diana, and the fatal car crash. Anti-Fayed media onslaughts do not seem to budge their scepticism about what happened. Yet a few very senior journalists, a handful of Metropolitan police officers with known links to the security service and a motley band of political ankle-biters together form the immovable object opposed to Mohamed Al Fayed's unstoppable force. Two newspaper editors dining in early 1997 swore they would have Fayed out of the country by the end of that year. How wrong they were. What do they fear? I am not a betting man, but if I were, I should say that ultimately salaried editors, an increasingly ragged security service and today's soft-centred establishment will prove no match for the determination of a very angry, rich man, who will leave no stone unturned to get at the truth and has not the slightest interest in middle-class pretensions. I like him. Charles Wardle is the Conservative MP for Bexhill and Battle",

Charles Wardle, the 60-year-old MP for Bexhill and Battle, admitted that some of his party colleagues \"loathe\" Mr Fayed and \"are furious with him for exposing the wrongdoing of corrupt cronies\". But the offence Mr Wardle may give Tory supporters of the disgraced former MPs, Jonathan Aitken and Neil Hamilton, is today compounded by his defence of the Harrods proprietor in an article in the Guardian. Ironically, Mr Wardle, a Harvard Business School graduate involved in many companies over the years, was the junior Home Office minister who rejected Mr Fayed's requests for a British passport in 1993 - on the basis of a Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) report, which subsequently he declared flawed and unfair. The move, which will see the MP almost triple his parliamentary salary for two days work a week, as a non-executive director of the Harrods board, has been cleared with the Tory whips office, with Mr Wardle's local party activists, and with Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary commissioner for standards. But today's Guardian article is certain to raise hackles, mainly on the right wing of the Conservative party where members still believe their colleagues were the victims of a vindictive conspiracy between the media and the Harrods boss, who has since been denied a UK passport by the home secretary. Not only does Mr Wardle insist Mr Fayed's private business activities are both more extensive than supposed and free of taint, he says: \"In spite of the war zone atmosphere, I like what I have seen.\" The MP even says that the French inquiry into the deaths of Princess Diana and Mr Fayed's son, Dodi, \"left many vital questions unanswered\".

And everybody is. Hearts And Bones (BBC1), Metropolis (ITV) and Coupling (BBC2) are all running the Maddy/Anna/Egg race, and in a cunning twist, C4 are roping in a bunch of real-life people to perform in Flat-Mate. Oh, and so are the BBC with The Horror Of_ Flatshare. But of course, the best version of This Life over the next few months will be, er, This Life, which BBC2 is reshowing in its 32-episode entirety. </p> <p> <strong> Best spinoff from a film about young East End gangsters</strong> </p> <p> Fighting off the warnings from anyone who's ever endured Clueless: The TV Show, Ferris Bueller: The Series or Honey I Shrunk The Kids: The TV Show, Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels comes ram-raiding onto C4's schedules with a whole new set of upwardly mobile phone users (ie no one from the film) scamming, ducking and diving, weaving and bobbing etc, etc... </p> <p> <strong> Best use of security cameras</strong> </p> <p> Channel 4 are offering you the chance to feel like a security guard, with a version of the Dutch surveillance game-show phenomenon which pitches a house full of strangers against each other for 90 days without telephones, newspapers, radio, or even television. Watch as they disintegrate into a savage community of chess-players, torturing each other with ingenious 24-hour mind-games, nominating fellow inmates to be evicted every week. Then the viewers vote and someone is chucked out. </p> <p> <strong> Best disabled show</strong> </p> <p> With features on the American Stunt School For The Disabled, Howard Stern's 3ft 6inch-tall sidekick Hank The Angry Dwarf, a deaf comedian signing jokes (with interpretation from Bernard Manning) and a section where the able-bodied will get a chance to \"let off steam about the disabled\", Freak Out (Channel 4), from the people that brought you Eurotrash, promises to get the most Shocked From Suburbs mail. </p> <p> <strong> Best rehash of a standard formula</strong> </p> <p> Sooner or later all those ideas you thought would never return will. So we've got an impressionist and a variety show on the horizon (Alistair McGowan's Big Impression on the BBC, and Tonight At The London Palladium on ITV). And the return of 70s revivals, just in case you didn't get enough in the 90s, with a 10-week run of I * 1970s, with the usual laugh-at-flares shenanigans. </p> <p> <strong> Most gratuitously graphic science documentary</strong> </p> <p> The grinning brain specialist the BBC have found to present Brain Story at the end of the summer Professor Susan Greenfield, promises to find out if humans are really just big-brained chimps, which sounds like a promising sort of endeavour. To do so she's going to be cutting open skulls and then reviving patients while they're under the knife. </p> <p> <strong> Most pointless gimmick</strong> </p> <p> We all use them, but only architects really care about them. In one of those not-so-freaky coincidences of TV scheduling, two new series are hoping to get more people thinking about buildings. With Shock Of The Old in August on Channel 4 Piers Gough takes the easy option of looking at old buildings and talking about them, while BBC2 looks set to inject a lot more tension into the proceedings in May by taking a presenter with a fear of heights (Kevin McCloud) and forcing him to climb up six famous structures in a programme called - wait for it - Don't Look Down. </p> <p> <strong> Best reason to stay up all night</strong> </p> <p> Continuing 4 Later's mission to turn us into sleep-deprived wrecks, 4 Music is promising 31 weeks of whatever's passing for rock and roll among the kids these days (Merz, Shack, Super Furry Animals, Flaming Lips, Angie Stone, The Beta Band etc.) And Jo Whiley, continuing her militant campaign against socks. </p> <p> <strong> Best Carol Vorderman vehicle</strong> </p> <p> Yes, she's a star, and we love her. And in case you'd forgotten that there was life outside daytime, ITV are boosting Carol's smiley profile with a wide selection of formats. Soon, for anyone with the foresight to go digital, ITV: Carol will be booming into your living rooms, but until then the terrestrial population will have to make do with her upcoming appearances on Stars And Their Lives, Carol Vorderman's Better Homes, The Pride Of Britain Awards, Time Travellers and Find A Fortune.

Best spinoff from a film about young East End gangsters Fighting off the warnings from anyone who's ever endured Clueless: The TV Show, Ferris Bueller: The Series or Honey I Shrunk The Kids: The TV Show, Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels comes ram-raiding onto C4's schedules with a whole new set of upwardly mobile phone users (ie no one from the film) scamming, ducking and diving, weaving and bobbing etc, etc... Best use of security cameras Channel 4 are offering you the chance to feel like a security guard, with a version of the Dutch surveillance game-show phenomenon which pitches a house full of strangers against each other for 90 days without telephones, newspapers, radio, or even television. Watch as they disintegrate into a savage community of chess-players, torturing each other with ingenious 24-hour mind-games, nominating fellow inmates to be evicted every week. Then the viewers vote and someone is chucked out. Best disabled show With features on the American Stunt School For The Disabled, Howard Stern's 3ft 6inch-tall sidekick Hank The Angry Dwarf, a deaf comedian signing jokes (with interpretation from Bernard Manning) and a section where the able-bodied will get a chance to \"let off steam about the disabled\", Freak Out (Channel 4), from the people that brought you Eurotrash, promises to get the most Shocked From Suburbs mail. Best rehash of a standard formula Sooner or later all those ideas you thought would never return will. So we've got an impressionist and a variety show on the horizon (Alistair McGowan's Big Impression on the BBC, and Tonight At The London Palladium on ITV). And the return of 70s revivals, just in case you didn't get enough in the 90s, with a 10-week run of I * 1970s, with the usual laugh-at-flares shenanigans. Most gratuitously graphic science documentary The grinning brain specialist the BBC have found to present Brain Story at the end of the summer Professor Susan Greenfield, promises to find out if humans are really just big-brained chimps, which sounds like a promising sort of endeavour. To do so she's going to be cutting open skulls and then reviving patients while they're under the knife. Most pointless gimmick We all use them, but only architects really care about them. In one of those not-so-freaky coincidences of TV scheduling, two new series are hoping to get more people thinking about buildings. With Shock Of The Old in August on Channel 4 Piers Gough takes the easy option of looking at old buildings and talking about them, while BBC2 looks set to inject a lot more tension into the proceedings in May by taking a presenter with a fear of heights (Kevin McCloud) and forcing him to climb up six famous structures in a programme called - wait for it - Don't Look Down. Best reason to stay up all night Continuing 4 Later's mission to turn us into sleep-deprived wrecks, 4 Music is promising 31 weeks of whatever's passing for rock and roll among the kids these days (Merz, Shack, Super Furry Animals, Flaming Lips, Angie Stone, The Beta Band etc.) And Jo Whiley, continuing her militant campaign against socks. Best Carol Vorderman vehicle Yes, she's a star, and we love her. And in case you'd forgotten that there was life outside daytime, ITV are boosting Carol's smiley profile with a wide selection of formats. Soon, for anyone with the foresight to go digital, ITV: Carol will be booming into your living rooms, but until then the terrestrial population will have to make do with her upcoming appearances on Stars And Their Lives, Carol Vorderman's Better Homes, The Pride Of Britain Awards, Time Travellers and Find A Fortune. Oh, and Countdown.",

      "bodyText": "Ramblers would gain the right to walk in the woods and wander along river banks under proposals launched today to extend right to roam legislation. In a move which will be resisted by landowners, pro-rambling Labour MPs are backing a change to the countryside and rights of way bill which would see woodland and riverside added to the list of moorland, mountains, heath, downs and commons land which will be opened up under the new law. A poll conducted by ICM for the Ramblers' Association found that 79% of people supported the extension of the freedom to roam. The amendment to the bill, which is today in its committee stage in the Commons, has been tabled by David Lepper, Labour MP for Brighton Pavilion. He said last night: \"It's not surprising that woodland ar eas are some of the most popular features of the countryside. \"My amendment would extend the scope of the right to roam to some of the most attractive woodland areas in the country, subject to commonsense restrictions.\" Gordon Prentice, Labour MP for Pendle and one of the staunchest Commons campaigners on the right to roam, also backed the change last night. He said: \"In Germany they have had forest laws since 1975 so Germans have the right to traipse through the woods.\" Ministers had indicated that there might be scope for including woodland in the legislation at a later stage, he said, but Mr Prentice called for it to be \"yoked into the bill\" now. Any attempt to extend the controversial right to roam legislation will be opposed by landowners and the Conservatives, who last week faced accusations of trying to wreck the bill after tabling 138 amend ments limiting its provisions. Privately, ministers are warning campaigners that the bill has always been a \"project of negotiations and compromises\". The government is deeply wary of alienating the countryside lobby and is likely to resist attempts at amend ments, though there may be some flexibility later. Countryside campaigners have already lost a battle over compensation for access in Oxfordshire, after the Lands Tribunal decided against awarding the 3rd Baron Rotherwick the \u00a31m compensation he sought after being forced to let ramblers use a footpath through his private forest. The hereditary peer had claimed that public access would hit income from forestry and game shooting. Tory amendments to the bill sought to ban access to the countryside at night, greatly restrict walkers' entry to private estates and criminalise those who broke new rules on ramblers' behaviour. Countryside campaigners claimed that many of the proposed changes would render almost meaningless the new freedoms promised by ministers. But opposition MPs insist they are trying to make the access rights workable, safer and less tempting to thieves.",

He was thrown out for standing against the party's official London mayoral candidate the moment nominations closed at noon for the mayoral and Greater London assembly elections.</p> <p>As Labour's Frank Dobson launched a \"Frank and to the point\" advertising campaign, and his running mate Trevor Phillips raised the prospect of an \"accommodation\" between the party and the independent frontrunner if Livingstone won, the former Greater London council leader said he hoped it would only be a \"trial separation\".</p> <p>But there was no sign of any let up in the onslaught from Labour's Millbank headquarters, which yesterday launched a renewed attempt to damage Mr Livingstone by highlighting his use of a company, called Localaction, to maximise his income from journalism and public speaking.</p> <p>The Brent East MP yesterday dismissed claims by Labour sources that he had wrongly used director's loans from the company to buy a holiday home in Brighton.</p> <p>\"This is absolute rubbish and comes from the same people who brought Peter Mandelson back into government after he failed to declare a \u00a3373,000 loan,\" Mr Livingstone said last night. \"Perhaps I'll be the next Northern Ireland secretary because of my accountancy skills.\"</p> <p>The loans, which were first made public more than five years ago, had either been repaid or converted into a dividend, on advice from his accountant. The Brighton house, bought last summer for \u00a3168,000 with his partner Kate Allen, had been financed with the dividend and a \u00a3120,000 mortgage.</p> <p>Mr Livingstone was suspended from the Labour party last month when he said that he would stand against Mr Dobson as an independent, leaving open the possibility that he might nevertheless withdraw at the last minute.</p> <p>Margaret McDonagh, Labour's general secretary, finalised his excommunication yesterday in a personal letter. \"By your actions you have excluded yourself from Labour party membership and you are therefore no longer a member,\" she wrote.</p> <p>Mr Livingstone responded by saying he expected to \"be back soon\".

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone was yesterday expelled from the Labour party after 31 years as a member and 13 as a Labour MP. He was thrown out for standing against the party's official London mayoral candidate the moment nominations closed at noon for the mayoral and Greater London assembly elections. As Labour's Frank Dobson launched a \"Frank and to the point\" advertising campaign, and his running mate Trevor Phillips raised the prospect of an \"accommodation\" between the party and the independent frontrunner if Livingstone won, the former Greater London council leader said he hoped it would only be a \"trial separation\". But there was no sign of any let up in the onslaught from Labour's Millbank headquarters, which yesterday launched a renewed attempt to damage Mr Livingstone by highlighting his use of a company, called Localaction, to maximise his income from journalism and public speaking. The Brent East MP yesterday dismissed claims by Labour sources that he had wrongly used director's loans from the company to buy a holiday home in Brighton. \"This is absolute rubbish and comes from the same people who brought Peter Mandelson back into government after he failed to declare a \u00a3373,000 loan,\" Mr Livingstone said last night. \"Perhaps I'll be the next Northern Ireland secretary because of my accountancy skills.\" The loans, which were first made public more than five years ago, had either been repaid or converted into a dividend, on advice from his accountant. The Brighton house, bought last summer for \u00a3168,000 with his partner Kate Allen, had been financed with the dividend and a \u00a3120,000 mortgage. Mr Livingstone was suspended from the Labour party last month when he said that he would stand against Mr Dobson as an independent, leaving open the possibility that he might nevertheless withdraw at the last minute. Margaret McDonagh, Labour's general secretary, finalised his excommunication yesterday in a personal letter. \"By your actions you have excluded yourself from Labour party membership and you are therefore no longer a member,\" she wrote. Mr Livingstone responded by saying he expected to \"be back soon\". He added: \"Once we have had the election and put all of this behind us, the party will want to work together to make sure London government functions properly.\" He said he hoped to be shown the \"same tolerance\" as those who had left Labour in the 1980s to join the Social Democratic party and who now worked in Downing Street. But Labour's spokesman said Mr Livingstone's chances of being allowed back had been \"obliterated by this\". Simon Fletcher, his political adviser who is also acting as his agent in the mayoral campaign, can now also expect to be expelled from the party, along with others who have signed his nomination papers. But there are also indications that the party hierarchy is keeping its options open on how to deal with Mr Livingstone as mayor if he wins the contest on 4 May. Mr Phillips, who heads the Labour list for the assembly elections and is standing as Mr Dobson's deputy, said that although Mr Livingstone would face an initially hostile reception from the Labour group, \"we would have to work out an accommodation\" and that he would \"have to work with us\". The full list of mayoral candidates will be announced tomorrow, but is expected to include Mr Livingstone, Mr Dobson, the Tories' Steven Norris, the Liberal Democrat's Susan Kramer, the Greens' Darren Johnson, and Ram Gidoomal of the Christian People's Alliance, Damien Hockney of the UK Independence party and Geoffrey Clements of the Natural Law party. Malcolm McLaren, former manager of the punk band, Sex Pistols, who had been planning to stand as an independent, announced yesterday he was pulling out of the race in favour of Mr Livingstone.",

His friendships were similarly adventurous. He would speak affectionately of Diana Mosley and Henry Williamson, Christine Keeler and Colin Wilson. The level of his tolerance of human oddity was part of his extraordinary charm.</p> <p>Surprisingly, he was born into the Anglican hierarchy in Bangkok, where his father was a teacher. His mother died soon after his birth and he was sent back to Cornwall, where his maternal grandparents took him into their care. He was baptised by his paternal grandfather, who came from a long line of Anglican clergy connected with the Oxford Movement.</p> <p>Brocard, then known as Michael Sewell, was a descendant of William Sewell, the Tractarian divine who founded Radley College. He was sent to Weymouth College, a minor public school in Dorset, run on low church lines. In his memoirs, The Habit Of A Lifetime, he described it as a hell of rain-drenched rugby pitches and swishing canes.</p> <p>Leaving at 16, with a surely record-breaking nil out of 300 in school certificate maths, he found a niche as general factotum in the London office of GK's Weekly, the paper founded by GK Chesterton, which was the official organ of the Distributist League. One of Sewell's weekly tasks was to collect copies of the new edition from the train at Euston, and bring them back by taxi. As he later wrote: \"Since all the bundles of copies could be got into one taxi, it will be surmised that the paper's circulation was not large.\"</p> <p>Working at GK's Weekly must have given Brocard his first taste of the joys of the small specialist enterprise - the little magazines and the private presses with which he has been so much associated. Surely, too, it was an early training in intransigence.</p> <p>Chesterton was the supreme fighting journalist of his age. Brocard recalled vividly that groaning, wheezing figure ascending the staircase, squashing his girth into the editor's swivel chair, and regaling the staff with conversation even better than Oscar Wilde's at his most scintillating. But it was typical of Brocard that when he came to write a book about a Chesterton, he selected not GK but his younger brother, Cecil, a political journalist, editor of the New Witness, and a fascinating but relatively obscure figure.</p> <p>So much of Brocard's writing was rescue operation, reflecting his own sharp appreciation of unobviousness. Like Black Swans was a good title for his collected studies because it was the black swans, not the white ones, that attracted him - his achievement was to show people that black swans could be interesting, too.</p> <p>Brocard's connection with Hilary Pepler, Eric Gill and the Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic dated back to his late schooldays, when he answered an advertisement in GK's Weekly for the workshops at Ditchling Common, Sussex. Arriving at St Dominic's Press, with its iron hand presses and frames containing cases of type, he felt he was entering a congenial new world. Within minutes, Pepler had handed him a setting stick and begun teaching him how to set up type by hand. After he left GK's, by now a Roman Catholic convert, he went back to Ditch ling as a compositor, and stayed for five years.</p> <p>In that Catholic community so alluringly combining the doggedly practical and fervently religious, the risqu\u00e9 and the rugged, intellectual and folksy, Brocard found an emotional haven and professional direction. All his life he continued his involvement with the printing crafts, working later as a compositor with Edward Walters, at Primrose Hill, and then as printer and editorial controller of St Albert's Press, at the Carmelite priory, Aylesford, from 1955. He paid a final debt to Pepler with his last great work of scholarship, the St Dominic's Press bibliography, magnificently printed at the Whittington Press in 1995.</p> <p>Brocard took me on my first visit to Ditchling, having rung me out of the blue at the Guardian offices. I still have the book he sent me after that memorable day - a copy of Two Friends, his study of John Gray and Andre Raffalovich, inscribed \"In spe novae amicitiae.\" We did indeed become friends, and 15 years later I began the biography of Eric Gill.</p> <p>Brocard was a tower of strength in the furore that followed publication. Though some of his confreres were shocked at the apparent sang froid with which he referred, in a television documentary, to Gill's \"peccadilloes\" - which included adultery, incest and experimental conjunction with his dog - Brocard refused to be budged from his conviction that Gill was fundamentally a holy man.</p> <p>In the 1950s at Aylesford, Father Brocard, whose religious name memorialised the 13th-century prior of the her mits of Mount Carmel, initiated the magazine that burgeoned to become one of the leading literary-intellectual journals of its period. The Aylesford Review, which has been seen as a successor to TS Eliot's Criterion, lasted from 1955 to 1968, and many of those early issues are now collectors' items.</p> <p>I particularly remember the special number on Aubrey Beardsley and the 1890s (published in 1966), surely the first serious reconsideration of Beardsley to emanate from a religious house, with a resplendent psychedelic cover, and the issue entitled Homage To EH Visiak (1967). Visiak, an almost forgotten writer and thinker in his late 80s, had been tracked down by Brocard to his retreat in Hove.</p> <p>The list of contributors to the Aylesford Review is remarkably eclectic, including Thomas Merton, John Gawsworth, Stevie Smith, Sylvia Townsend Warner and Henry Williamson. Even more impressive is the list of young writers the review published before they became well-known: DM Thomas, Angela Carter, Penelope Shuttle, and Frances and Michael Horowitz. Brocard's wide contacts and warm friendships gave the review its special flavour; it was the point at which the beat generation met the Roman Catholic church in England, an unlikely convergence only he could have achieved.</p> <p>I wrote my first book review for Brocard, and one of my lasting regrets is that I never went to one of the Aylesford priory weekends. These were literary gatherings at which writers, known and unknown, leftwing and very rightwing, would stay in the priory guesthouse, united in affection and respect for Father Brocard and a belief in the seriousness of writing.</p> <p>In the early 1960s, the Aylesford Review entered a more combative, overtly political phase, publishing articles on the Official Secrets Act, police corruption and the Profumo scandal. It was at this stage that Brocard first befriended Christine Keeler, described in his memoirs as \"a beautiful and well-mannered young woman\". When asked how it was that these incendiarist issues drew no comment from his superiors, Brocard suggested that neither the prior nor the prior-general ever read the magazine.</p> <p>They did, however, respond firmly to the letter he wrote to the Times in 1968 protesting at the papal report on birth control. His first sentence had an obviously Chestertonian ring: \"Sir, The publication of the encyclical letter Humanae Vitae shows, if nothing else, that the Orthodox and other eastern churches are fully justified in their mistrust of the papal office as it has developed over the centuries since the great schism.\"</p> <p>Father Brocard was suspended from preaching and hearing confessions in his diocese, and expelled from the priory at Aylesford. He went into exile in Canada, teaching courses on the pre-Raphaelites and fin-de-siecle writers at St Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. He then moved to Mount Carmel College, where, among other things, he taught young seminarists to make Christmas puddings - to a recipe by the poet Frances Horowitz, who became a close and valued friend.</p> <p>In his final years, the authorities relented and he came back to the Carmelite houses at Faversham and, most recently, East Finchley. Though the inmates were kind to him, he moaned about East Finchley, finding the suburban sameness at odds with his distinctively Firbankian tastes.</p> <p>Brocard was a stalwart companion, with the celibate's antennae for the sexual and emotional upheavals of his friends. Tetes-a-tetes in out-of-the-way tearooms were his speciality and he amazed my teenage son by demanding two double vermouths in a pub. He once made the comment that \"perhaps most of us have, at least potentially, something of the decadent in us.\"</p> <p>Father Brocard's reclamation of forgotten, esoteric writers of the 1890s was his major literary life's work. Gray and Raffalovich; Arthur Machen; Frederick Rolfe, Baron Corvo; Olive Custance, the poet, Lord Alfred Douglas's wife; the dubious demonologist, the Rev Montague Summers. It has been a weird and marvellous pursuit.</p> <p><b> Fiona MacCarthy</b></p> <p>Father Brocard (Michael) Sewell, priest, printer and writer, born July 30 1912; died April 2 2000</p>",

I still have the book he sent me after that memorable day - a copy of Two Friends, his study of John Gray and Andre Raffalovich, inscribed \"In spe novae amicitiae.\" We did indeed become friends, and 15 years later I began the biography of Eric Gill. Brocard was a tower of strength in the furore that followed publication. Though some of his confreres were shocked at the apparent sang froid with which he referred, in a television documentary, to Gill's \"peccadilloes\" - which included adultery, incest and experimental conjunction with his dog - Brocard refused to be budged from his conviction that Gill was fundamentally a holy man. In the 1950s at Aylesford, Father Brocard, whose religious name memorialised the 13th-century prior of the her mits of Mount Carmel, initiated the magazine that burgeoned to become one of the leading literary-intellectual journals of its period. The Aylesford Review, which has been seen as a successor to TS Eliot's Criterion, lasted from 1955 to 1968, and many of those early issues are now collectors' items. I particularly remember the special number on Aubrey Beardsley and the 1890s (published in 1966), surely the first serious reconsideration of Beardsley to emanate from a religious house, with a resplendent psychedelic cover, and the issue entitled Homage To EH Visiak (1967). Visiak, an almost forgotten writer and thinker in his late 80s, had been tracked down by Brocard to his retreat in Hove. The list of contributors to the Aylesford Review is remarkably eclectic, including Thomas Merton, John Gawsworth, Stevie Smith, Sylvia Townsend Warner and Henry Williamson. Even more impressive is the list of young writers the review published before they became well-known: DM Thomas, Angela Carter, Penelope Shuttle, and Frances and Michael Horowitz. Brocard's wide contacts and warm friendships gave the review its special flavour; it was the point at which the beat generation met the Roman Catholic church in England, an unlikely convergence only he could have achieved. I wrote my first book review for Brocard, and one of my lasting regrets is that I never went to one of the Aylesford priory weekends. These were literary gatherings at which writers, known and unknown, leftwing and very rightwing, would stay in the priory guesthouse, united in affection and respect for Father Brocard and a belief in the seriousness of writing. In the early 1960s, the Aylesford Review entered a more combative, overtly political phase, publishing articles on the Official Secrets Act, police corruption and the Profumo scandal. It was at this stage that Brocard first befriended Christine Keeler, described in his memoirs as \"a beautiful and well-mannered young woman\". When asked how it was that these incendiarist issues drew no comment from his superiors, Brocard suggested that neither the prior nor the prior-general ever read the magazine. They did, however, respond firmly to the letter he wrote to the Times in 1968 protesting at the papal report on birth control. His first sentence had an obviously Chestertonian ring: \"Sir, The publication of the encyclical letter Humanae Vitae shows, if nothing else, that the Orthodox and other eastern churches are fully justified in their mistrust of the papal office as it has developed over the centuries since the great schism.\" Father Brocard was suspended from preaching and hearing confessions in his diocese, and expelled from the priory at Aylesford. He went into exile in Canada, teaching courses on the pre-Raphaelites and fin-de-siecle writers at St Francis Xavier University in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. He then moved to Mount Carmel College, where, among other things, he taught young seminarists to make Christmas puddings - to a recipe by the poet Frances Horowitz, who became a close and valued friend. In his final years, the authorities relented and he came back to the Carmelite houses at Faversham and, most recently, East Finchley. Though the inmates were kind to him, he moaned about East Finchley, finding the suburban sameness at odds with his distinctively Firbankian tastes. Brocard was a stalwart companion, with the celibate's antennae for the sexual and emotional upheavals of his friends. Tetes-a-tetes in out-of-the-way tearooms were his speciality and he amazed my teenage son by demanding two double vermouths in a pub. He once made the comment that \"perhaps most of us have, at least potentially, something of the decadent in us.\" Father Brocard's reclamation of forgotten, esoteric writers of the 1890s was his major literary life's work. Gray and Raffalovich; Arthur Machen; Frederick Rolfe, Baron Corvo; Olive Custance, the poet, Lord Alfred Douglas's wife; the dubious demonologist, the Rev Montague Summers. It has been a weird and marvellous pursuit. Fiona MacCarthy Father Brocard (Michael) Sewell, priest, printer and writer, born July 30 1912; died April 2 2000",

His version convinced his superiors this meant a German military unit was using the monastery as its command post, in breach of a Vatican agreement which treated it as neutral.</p> <p>Allied generals ordered a huge bombing attack. Only when the planes were in the air did a British intelligence officer, Colonel David Hunt, recheck the full radio intercept. He found that what it actually said was: \"The abbot is with the monks in the monastery\".</p> <p>\"Tragically, this was discovered too late,\" the book says. \"The bombers were already approaching.\"</p> <p>Monte Cassino - founded in 526 by St Benedict, numbering St Thomas Aquinas among its early monks - was blitzed in what is mourned as probably the greatest single aesthetic disaster of the war. Some 250 men, women and children died.</p> <p>The ruins created a superb German defensive position which cost thousands of allied soldiers' lives before the monastery fell after a further three months of fighting. Controversy continues over whether it was German-occupied before the bombing.</p> <p>Hunt's account of the intercept is told for the first time in With Alex at War, the autobiography of Sir Rupert Clarke, aide -de-camp to Field Marshal Lord Alexander of Tunis, deputy supreme allied commander in Europe and the leading British general in the liberation of Italy.</p> <p><b> 'Awful tragedy'</b><br></p> <p>Last night Brigadier Bryan Watkins, who collaborated with Sir Rupert on the book, said: \"It was an awful tragedy. It was idleness by the man who read the intercept. I don't find the story at all hard to believe. War is a balls-up.\" The book does not name the intelligence officer.</p> <p>Field Marshal Lord Carver, former chief of general staff, who is writing the Imperial War Museum's official history War in Italy, 1943-45, said he had not previously heard of the intercept.</p> <p>Col Hunt - Alexander's personal intelligence officer - later became Sir David Hunt, diplomat, author and private secretary to the post-war prime ministers Clement Attlee and Winston Churchill.</p> <p>In February 1944, when Monte Cassino was bombed, he was general staff officer in charge of intelligence in a unit with Sir Rupert. German strongpoints in the mountains around Cassino were imperilling the allied advance towards Rome.</p> <p>Fighting in conditions almost as severe as the trenches of the first world war, allied units on exposed slopes were under heavy artillery fire which they were convinced was being directed by spotters in the 1,600ft high monastery. But Sir Rupert's book says Hunt told him after the war that the monastery was not occupied by the German parachutists who were holding the Cassino feature.</p> <p>\"However, a radio intercept of the German command net reported that a parachute commander had been heard to ask 'Ist Abt in Kloster?' and was answered, 'Ja in Kloster mit Monchen'.</p> <p>\"The intelligence officer who received the intercept only recorded the answer 'Yes from the enemy'. The translation then produced was 'Is the HQ in the abbey?' - the word 'abt' being taken as an abbreviation for 'Abteilung' (a battalion) rather than abbot. It was only when Col Hunt questioned the translation and the whole intercept that it transpired that the correct reply to the question was, in fact, 'Ja, Abt is mit Monchem in Kloster'. ie: 'Yes. The abbot is with the monks in the monastery'.\"</p> <p>Sir Rupert adds: \"Rather than saving lives, that bombing would lead to savage losses\".</p> <p>From his own study of the papers of British, American and Commonwealth generals in the Imperial War Museum, Lord Carver said he did not think the reportedly misread intercept was likely to have influenced the decision to bomb.</p> <p>\"What they were arguing about with each other was not whether the monastery was occupied but whether, if the attack was going to be successful, the top of the hill should be obliterated.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I don't think the bombing was necessary or could be justified.\"</p> <p>But Brigadier Watkins said: \"Both the allied and German sides had given undertakings to the Pope that they would not destroy the monastery. We know from records that Alexander was very conscious of allied responsibilities under this agreement.The intercept, in its mistranslated form, implied the Germans had broken their word. That exonerated the allies and served as a green light for the bombing.\"</p> <p>In public, allied leaders exploited the belief that Monte Cassino was occupied to prepare opinion for aerial attacks on it. On February 11 - four days before the bombing - the Daily Mail ran an army-inspired lead story, Nazis Turn Cassino Monastery into Fort.</p> <p>On February 14 allied guns fired leaflets over the area warning that, in view of the German occupation, \"with very heavy hearts we are going to have to turn our weapons on the abbey\".</p> <p>The abbot, who survived the bombing, said: \"I swear there were never any German soldiers in the area of the monastery.\"</p> <p>Panzer corps messages quoted by German historians after the war speak of a 300-metre military no-go area around the abbey.

      "bodyText": "The world's most glorious monastery, at Monte Cassino in Italy, was destroyed during the second world war because of a mistake by a British junior officer, according to new evidence in a book due out this week. The officer - translating an intercepted radio message - mistook the German word for abbot for a similar word meaning battalion. His version convinced his superiors this meant a German military unit was using the monastery as its command post, in breach of a Vatican agreement which treated it as neutral. Allied generals ordered a huge bombing attack. Only when the planes were in the air did a British intelligence officer, Colonel David Hunt, recheck the full radio intercept. He found that what it actually said was: \"The abbot is with the monks in the monastery\". \"Tragically, this was discovered too late,\" the book says. \"The bombers were already approaching.\" Monte Cassino - founded in 526 by St Benedict, numbering St Thomas Aquinas among its early monks - was blitzed in what is mourned as probably the greatest single aesthetic disaster of the war. Some 250 men, women and children died. The ruins created a superb German defensive position which cost thousands of allied soldiers' lives before the monastery fell after a further three months of fighting. Controversy continues over whether it was German-occupied before the bombing. Hunt's account of the intercept is told for the first time in With Alex at War, the autobiography of Sir Rupert Clarke, aide -de-camp to Field Marshal Lord Alexander of Tunis, deputy supreme allied commander in Europe and the leading British general in the liberation of Italy. 'Awful tragedy' Last night Brigadier Bryan Watkins, who collaborated with Sir Rupert on the book, said: \"It was an awful tragedy. It was idleness by the man who read the intercept. I don't find the story at all hard to believe. War is a balls-up.\" The book does not name the intelligence officer. Field Marshal Lord Carver, former chief of general staff, who is writing the Imperial War Museum's official history War in Italy, 1943-45, said he had not previously heard of the intercept. Col Hunt - Alexander's personal intelligence officer - later became Sir David Hunt, diplomat, author and private secretary to the post-war prime ministers Clement Attlee and Winston Churchill. In February 1944, when Monte Cassino was bombed, he was general staff officer in charge of intelligence in a unit with Sir Rupert. German strongpoints in the mountains around Cassino were imperilling the allied advance towards Rome. Fighting in conditions almost as severe as the trenches of the first world war, allied units on exposed slopes were under heavy artillery fire which they were convinced was being directed by spotters in the 1,600ft high monastery. But Sir Rupert's book says Hunt told him after the war that the monastery was not occupied by the German parachutists who were holding the Cassino feature. \"However, a radio intercept of the German command net reported that a parachute commander had been heard to ask 'Ist Abt in Kloster?' and was answered, 'Ja in Kloster mit Monchen'. \"The intelligence officer who received the intercept only recorded the answer 'Yes from the enemy'. The translation then produced was 'Is the HQ in the abbey?' - the word 'abt' being taken as an abbreviation for 'Abteilung' (a battalion) rather than abbot. It was only when Col Hunt questioned the translation and the whole intercept that it transpired that the correct reply to the question was, in fact, 'Ja, Abt is mit Monchem in Kloster'. ie: 'Yes. The abbot is with the monks in the monastery'.\" Sir Rupert adds: \"Rather than saving lives, that bombing would lead to savage losses\". From his own study of the papers of British, American and Commonwealth generals in the Imperial War Museum, Lord Carver said he did not think the reportedly misread intercept was likely to have influenced the decision to bomb. \"What they were arguing about with each other was not whether the monastery was occupied but whether, if the attack was going to be successful, the top of the hill should be obliterated.\" He added: \"I don't think the bombing was necessary or could be justified.\" But Brigadier Watkins said: \"Both the allied and German sides had given undertakings to the Pope that they would not destroy the monastery. We know from records that Alexander was very conscious of allied responsibilities under this agreement.The intercept, in its mistranslated form, implied the Germans had broken their word. That exonerated the allies and served as a green light for the bombing.\" In public, allied leaders exploited the belief that Monte Cassino was occupied to prepare opinion for aerial attacks on it. On February 11 - four days before the bombing - the Daily Mail ran an army-inspired lead story, Nazis Turn Cassino Monastery into Fort. On February 14 allied guns fired leaflets over the area warning that, in view of the German occupation, \"with very heavy hearts we are going to have to turn our weapons on the abbey\". The abbot, who survived the bombing, said: \"I swear there were never any German soldiers in the area of the monastery.\" Panzer corps messages quoted by German historians after the war speak of a 300-metre military no-go area around the abbey. But details about the timing of these messages are not clear enough to rule out the possibility that they were transmitted as propaganda after the bombing. Monte Cassino, restored in the 1950s, is a shrine for relatives of the estimated 183,000 soldiers on all sides who lost their lives in the battles around it. From Lombards to Second World War 529 St Benedict founds the monastery, with a routine of prayer and farming, on a pagan temple site 87 miles south-east of Rome. There he writes the Rule of St Benedict, which becomes a guide for celibate asceticism.

      "bodyText": "The Libyan leader, Muammar Gadafy, took a further step towards ending his pariah status in the west yesterday when he met the European Commission president, Romano Prodi. The two met in Cairo, where Colonel Gadafy is attending the first European Union-Africa summit. \"This is not the final step, it's not the opening of all gates, [but] I think it's fair to say that it's improving,\" Riccardo Levi, Mr Prodi's press spokesman, said. The meeting was seen by Mr Prodi as vindicating his policy of helping to bring Col Gadafy back into the wider international community. Mr Prodi was criticised by European leaders in December when he invited the Libyan leader to Brussels, a meeting that did not take place. The meeting yesterday was the most important development of the first day of the EU-Africa summit. Another positive development was an offer by the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, of \u00a3200m in debt relief to 30 African countries as \"a special sign of solidarity\". During his meeting with Mr Prodi, Col Gadafy was in a cooperative mood. Fear had been expressed by the conference organisers that he might disrupt proceedings by expressing his hostility towards Israel, or call for an apology for the crusades. A communique said Col Gadafy affirmed during a long and friendly meeting with Mr Prodi that Libya accepted that the terms of the so-called Barcelona process of cooperation between the EU and Mediterranean states were not negotiable. The EU wants Libya to accept officially that Israel and the Palestinian Authority are entitled to participate fully in the Euro-Med dialogue, and to undertake not to block the Middle East peace process. Mr Prodi said the Cairo meeting was no substitute for an eventual invitation to Brussels. Commenting on the US restoration of relations a fortnight ago, Col Gadafy said: \"The Americans made a smart move. They sent this delegation after long years of boycott and the rise of oil prices.\" The UN suspended sanctions against Libya almost a year ago, after it handed over for trial in the Netherlands two men indicted for the 1988 bombing of a PanAm airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people were killed. Britain restored full diplomatic relations with Tripoli after it agreed to pay compensation for the killing of a British police officer by gunfire from the Libyan mission in London in 1984. In the conference hall, African and EU leaders came together with warm words of cooperation at their inaugural summit, which is seen as a major effort to bring the heavily indebted African countries into the global economic and political mainstream. Debt remains the overriding issue and Germany's offer makes only a small dent in it.",

      "bodyText": "Why are some radio stations in the United States not playing the latest single by one of country music's most famous groups? Because it celebrates the killing of a violent husband and appears to have touched a raw nerve among male DJs and radio producers. The song, Goodbye Earl, features on Fly, the latest album from the Dixie Chicks, which won a Grammy award and has sold more than 4m copies. The bouncy tune tells the story of two friends, Maryanne and Wanda, who decide to poison Wanda's violent husband. They decide it is poetic justice to use black-eyed peas, as Earl gave his wife so many black eyes. After disposing of the body, the two women set up a roadside stand where they sell Tennessee ham and jam and \"don't lose any sleep at night\". The video which accompanies the song shows the band gleefully dumping the tarpaulin-wrapped body of the abusive Earl and includes the line: \"Earl had to die\". The song has been such a success that it is number eight in the Billboard pop charts and holds the number two spot in the country charts. But while such a hit would normally be heard across the airwaves with enormous frequency, the song is experiencing problems getting airplay. Although the Dixie Chicks have said that the song is meant to be \"tongue-in-cheek\", some radio stations believe that it sends the wrong message. One radio programme director in Pennsylvania said that a line had to be drawn. \"What do we do a song about next - school shootings?\" A number of stations have decided not to play the song. Initially the band's record company was reluctant to release the song as a single but changed its mind when it became clear that it was the most popular song on the album. Some of those radio stations that are playing the song are suggesting that there are other ways of dealing with domestic violence. They supply the telephone numbers of local and national organisations that can offer help and refuge to abused victims. The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence said that while it does not condone the action taken in the song, it welcomes the fact that it has raised the issue of wife abuse. \"Many battered women feel trapped and feel that violence is their only option to get away from the abuser,\" said Rita Smith, the coalition's executive director. \"We don't want them feeling that way.

It is also to be decided whether the permanent members should retain a veto. The UN millennium meeting could turn out to be the biggest ever meeting of government leaders: between 130 and 150 are expected to attend. One of the main themes of Mr Annan's speech was to achieve a target of lifting 1bn people out of extreme poverty by 2015. Education was a key element in achieving this.

Calling extreme poverty \"an affront to our common humanity\", he said that nearly half the world's 6bn people were now living on less than $2 a day, and about 1.2bn were struggling on less than $1 a day - including 500m in south Asia and 300m in Africa.

Vital ingredient: extract of berries of guarana, an Amazonian plant with alleged aphrodisiac, medicinal and energy-giving properties. Says who? Indians. They've been drinking it for generations. Any proof? Legend has it that the first bush sprouted where a bolt of lightning hit lovers from rival tribes. Corroborative evidence? \"The drink is so powerful that while hunting, the Indians do not feel hunger from one day to the next,\" according to adventurer John Philip Bettendorf in the 17th-century. How about some proper science? Guarana berries contain guaranine, which has similar effects to caffeine. Sounds interesting. Where can I get some? It's coming soon to a bar near you. PepsiCo has done a deal in Brazil to distribute it worldwide. How come? The tipple sells almost 1bn litres a year in Brazil, and ranks 15th among the world's top-selling soft drinks. PepsiCo hopes it will become a core side brand to Pepsi cola and eventually win 1% of the world soft drink market. Any chance of that? Guarana extracts are already popular in many New Age products, which claim to give a natural high. So is it a sure-fire success? Not certain. Pepsi has tried before. In 1996 it launched the guarana-infused Josta in the US, using rainforest imagery and an appeal to the drink's \"primal power\". But Josta proved impotent and was withdrawn last year. Spurious guarana fact: Brazilians regard the drink as a symbol of national pride. One Brazilian president was such a fan that he had it shipped 800 miles to the national palace. Do say: \"Would Mr President be wanting some cigars with his guarana tonight?\" Don't say: \"If it's from the Amazon, it'll be cheaper than Waterstones.\" Not to be confused with: Guacamole, Guangzhou, the Guardian.",

The BBC is increasingly using staff over retirement age on associate contracts. Midland Bank had to bring back older managers after a restructuring because of a lack of skills and knowledge. Shell is using senior managers to mentor small businesses. It's good to be grey.</p> <p>\"Most of the movement so far has been among people who are in receipt of a pension, but want to top it up with some contract or part-time work,\" says Garner. \"Very often, companies keep quiet about it because there can be tax implications, but it is definitely happening.\"</p> <p>At first sight, the case for companies, and indeed Governments, raising retirement ages seems a no-brainer. People are living longer and more healthily, meaning that they are productive for longer; the structure of the population means that without reform we face a demographic time bomb as tomorrow's workers struggle to pay the pensions of the retired baby-boomers; the nature of work has changed so that raw physical strength is less important than intellectual skills, experience and knowledge - all of which older workers have in abundance.</p> <p>In 1960, most people could expect a gap of between two to three years between their last day at work and their last rites. Today, the gap is over 10 years, and many workers can look forward to decades of retirement. A recent report by JP Morgan estimates that without a change in policies by both firms and governments, living standards could drop by 15% as huge pension bills hit the doormats of the shrinking working population.</p> <p>And for many, of course, work brings social advantages, a social circle, a sense of belonging. \"I work partly because I like the company,\" says Wilma, who works at the Industrial Society. The dispersal of families increases this need. \"Maybe if you have lots of family around you it's OK,\" she says. \"But most of my family are in Italy, and some in Australia.\" Later retirement could also help to rebalance working lives in a more family-friendly direction, rather than cramming all the work into the decades when children are most likely to be on the scene.</p> <p>Against this backdrop, early retirement seems crazy - but out dated attitudes to the value of older workers have been pushing companies in that direction. \"More than two thirds of retirements take place before official retirement age,\" says Garner. \"The growth in early retirement has been fastest on the grounds of efficiency or redundancy, not ill health.\" Negative attitudes about age are hard to shake off.</p> <p>Economic and social trends all seem to point to a loosening-up of the retirement age. Nonetheless, the debate remains a thorny one. Charities representing older people see an increase in retirement ages as eroding our right to a long and enjoyable post-work life, and worry that workers in less skilled jobs will lose out.</p> <p>\"It might be satisfactory for professional, skilled people,\" says a spokesman for Age Concern. \"But what about people who are not well-paid, who are not as skilled? Simply moving up the retirement age is prejudiced against them.\"</p> <p>She also said that moving the retirement age risked breaking a moral contract with workers who have been paying into their pension fund. \"If you have been paying in with an expectation that you can draw out at a certain age then it is deeply unfair to change that,\" she said.</p> <p>But for the moment, employment trends mean that firms are working harder to retain older workers. Skills shortages - especially in manage ment, which appears to be the biggest headache - and low unemployment mean that firms in the south are courting the older worker. \"I'd like to think there had been a change in attitudes,\" says Garner. \"But I think the truth is that the condition of the job market is what is really concentrating minds. Employers need the skills, it is as simple as that.\"</p> <p>But any moves that challenge ageist assumptions are to be welcomed, she said, not least because of the effects on workers lower down the age distribution. \"Once we started seeing 50 as a retirement age, it didn't seem worth training 45-year-olds.\" Research shows that people believe that age discrimination starts as early as 42.</p> <p>There is also good evidence that older workers might be better value for money; they are less likely to leave, more likely to turn up to work - B&amp;Q found absenteeism rates were 39% lower among older workers - and, according to Wilma, more committed to the job at hand. \"With older workers you know they are working because they really want to rather than because they have to,\" she points out.</p> <p>She certainly intends to keep going. For her, the prospect of working until the end is exciting. \"I think I'll just keep going,\" she says. \"I don't see why I should stop. I'll keep going.\"</p> <p><b> In praise of gerontocracy: it's time the pendulum swung back</b><br> By Peregrine Worsthorne<br> O ne person's delayed retirement is another person's delayed promotion, as the middle-aged Prince Charles would be the first to recognise. Indeed, that is how I used to look at the question during my own very many years as a deputy editor of the Sunday Telegraph. But of course it wasn't how I looked at the matter when I, in my turn, was eventually chucked out aged 65 to make way for a younger man whose abilities I rated no higher than my own. So like most others who are compulsorily retired from jobs they are enjoying and, in their own opinion, doing well, I felt hard done by and frustrated. Which, in a way, I still do.</p> <p>Whether 65, let alone 60, is the right age for compulsory retirement, however, is another matter, bearing in mind the prospect of all of us living for so much longer - in many cases to 100. Given this prospect, surely it is time we did start moving back to the old retirement age of 70 or 75, which would be fair to all.</p> <p>Take myself, for example. Now that I am 76, I do feel both physically and mentally ready for retirement, which I most certainly did not 10 years ago. Concentration is indeed fading, as is memory and also interest and curiosity. If retirement had been delayed until now, it would have come as a blessed relief rather than a cursed deprivation.</p> <p>Likewise, looking at it from the other end of the spectrum, if retirement was postponed to 70 or 75 - as is now being proposed - 50 year olds, with another quarter of a century of active life to look forward to, would be feeling in less of an urgent hurry for promotion.</p> <p>Of course there is no ideal age for retirement, and never can be, since some of us are born longing for retirement almost as soon as we put our shoulders to the wheel and others cannot face the prospect of idleness until they have both feet in the grave; nor does age always bring with it wisdom and experience any more than youth always guarantees energy and enterprise. Sometimes you have young heads on old shoulders, and just as often - as in the case of the young William Rees-Mogg - you have very old heads on very young shoulders. In other words, maximum flexibility and minimum uniformity must be the right approach to the retirement age. As for so much else.</p> <p>But the result will never really satisfy everyone. For if the old are left in charge they will tend to favour their contemporaries for the plum jobs - the old-boy network - which is unfair to the young and if the young come to the top early, they in turn will practice the same kind of favouritism. In short, the choice is between gerontocracy - which used to be the order of the day when I was young - or youthocracy, which has been the order of the day in my old age, condemning me to the worst of both worlds.</p> <p>A lthough the swing back of the pendulum to gerontocracy will be too late for me and many others, it is a good thing if it happens, since the young have been having it all their own way, in most walks of life, for far too long, with results that scarcely inspire confidence, judging by the reduction of standards in the increasingly youth-led institutions, from the prime ministership down to the media, where the average age of editors has never been lower. So it is no accident that the most revered figure of our time - indeed the only revered figure of our times - is an octogenarian pope.</p> <p>B ut what about the benefits of early retirement for those who cannot wait to escape the harness - won't they be the losers if the retirement age is put back to where it was in the bad old days? Indeed they will, which is why it certainly should not be put back for those who have dull jobs from which no satisfaction can be drawn. For them, escape with a decent pension should come as early as the economy will allow for. But for managing directors and their like - top dogs - who long to carry on with all the perks, it should come as late as possible, since there is no more off-putting and demoralising spectacle than of them guzzling and boozing away fat pensions and redundancy payments in mid-week, post-golf lunches in expensive pubs and clubs throughout the home counties.</p> <p>On balance I think Dr Johnson (or was it Adam Smith?) was right when he said that man is never so innocently employed as when he is earning money, to which I would add, and never so frustratingly employed as when spending it, which is all that early retirement leaves the erstwhile high-earners to do. Workers of the world unite, you have nothing to gain by losing your chains. So in thy mercy, oh Lord, keep us at it until we drop.</p> <p>\u0095 Richard Reeves is director of futures at the Industrial Society.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Walking through Kensington Gardens in central London on a spring afternoon, things are poking through the soil, there's blossom on the ornamental cherry trees and obscene, sticky sci-fi buds bursting on the boughs of the chestnuts. Nature's at it again. </p> <p>But it isn't natural, is it? The squirrels the kids coo over are American imports that have killed off our native species. The cormorants perched on the posts in the lake shouldn't be inland, but have nothing left to eat in the North Sea. There's almost nothing natural about the park - not the artfully placed stands of trees, the acres of greensward, or the carefully managed stands of bankside reeds. </p> <p>The Greenhouse Effect, an international exhibition about nature and artifice at the gardens' Serpentine Gallery, made me think about all this. The guest curator, Ralph Rugoff, has filled the galleries with a simulated riot of nature. Walking into the climate-controlled, gravity-defying upside- down rainforest of exotic greenery that grows from the ceiling and fills one of the Serpentine's spaces, I conclude, reluctantly, that Kew Gardens has more to offer. Bringing the outside inside is one of contemporary art's more persistent cliches. </p> <p>It is difficult to see The Greenhouse Effect as anything other than a sampling of the many artists whose work is in some way concerned with our relationship to nature. The hard part, of course, is to say anything meaningful about the relationship, rather than indulging in a lot of hand-wringing about despoliation and mystic clap-trap about our being part of, rather than apart from, the natural world. Mark Dion's catalogue manifesto, consisting of notes on the ethical relationship between the artist and the environment, try to map out a territory of action, but like all manifestos, it veers between the goody-goody and the apopleptic. </p> <p>Many of the artists here - too many, in fact - simply copy nature, not to show how close we are to it, but to point up the schism between the natural world and human artifice. To be cynical, the generation that read Jean Baudrillard so avidly in the 80s must have found all the controversy over genetic engineering and cloning, and the advent of virtual reality, a confirmation of the belief that the world is becoming a simulacrum of itself, and that what is left of nature now is only a theme park. </p> <p>The artists here demonstrate great skill and amazing technical resourcefulness in their trompe-l'oeil re-creations, just as 18th and 19th century ornithological and botanical painters so faithfully recorded the curl of every feather, the form of every stamen. Tim Hawkinson has made a tiny, fragile and entirely believable skeleton of a baby bird from his own nail clippings, and a feather from the hairs on the back of his neck. It is all done with a magnifying glass and superglue. His huge root ball, a great gnarled, tuberous tree stump, is made, appropriately enough, from paper, while his perfectly lifelike spider's web is, again, knotted from his own hair. Tom Friedman has made life-size insects from the most modern materials (Play-Doh, fishing line, plastic and something called fuzz). His dragonfly - a perfect double-take - perches on the edge of a white minimal cuboid. </p> <p>His Daddy Long Legs waits on the wall, although it isn't what we would call a daddy long legs (the adult crane fly), but one of those long-legged autumnal spiders with a body like a dun-coloured pea. Yoshiro Suda's flowering ivy, its long tendril sprouting from the wall, has been hand-carved from wood, while Roxy Paine's Psilocybe Cubensis Field covers the floor with 2,200 polymer hallucinogenic mushrooms. It goes on: seaweed and lichen tabletop forests, plastic weeds, man-made tree fungus and rice-glue mould. </p> <p>This is all very well, but taken together these works all suffer a distinct lack of artistic biodiversity. The artist Vincent Shine, for one, was doing much the same thing a decade ago. The desire to recreate nature, to turn it into a symbol and to possess it in some way, has a pedigree that goes back to the cave. It made me think of Albrecht Durer's wonderful early 16th-century drawing of a patch of turf, and how his attention to a tiny unregarded patch of fertile sod fills the viewer's imagination with an entire natural world. At its best, all this stuff should lead you back to the world rather than away from it. </p> <p> Nina Katchadourian tries to trick spiders with her patches of \"lightly starched M\u00f6lnlycke red sewing thread reinforced with polyvinyl glue\", with which she repairs their torn webs. The spiders aren't fooled, and reject her patched repairs. Maybe they don't like red. Katchadourian goes to inordinate lengths to record the spiders' reaction to her efforts, in what can only be a spoof of arachnid research. That said, back in the 60s researchers really did drug spiders with LSD, booze and coffee to see how their web building technique was affected. Spaced-out and pissed, the spiders managed somehow, even if they lost concentration for a bit; jazzed-up on caffeine, however, they really made a botch of things. The research was more bizarre and fascinating than this. </p> <p>And that's the trouble. Real entomology, botany and zoology reveal far more interesting aspects of the natural world than anything here. But then again, hard science also begets monsters, like Dolly the sheep and Monsanto. The argument is, of course, that man has been genetically engineering plants and mucking about with Darwin's order since the first crop was planted, the first wild dog was tamed. If this exhibition is trying to talk about the loss of nature, it should go beyond the sentimental and nostalgic yearning for a golden age that cannot be reclaimed, because it never existed. </p> <p>The truth is, though, the decline of the natural world is probably irreversible. Yet there is a place for wonder, even if it is tinged with loss. Anya Gallachio has replanted a grubbed-up old apple tree from an orchard, and it is bursting into leaf on the gallery floor. Michel Blazy's artificial rain, drooled from threads of hot glue suspended from the ceiling, has a wonderful sparkling, ephemeral quality. There's a much harder edge to Olafur Eliasson's artificial rain room, Your Strange Certainty Still Kept. </p> <p>A curtain of water rains down into a trough, in a darkened room lit by a bank of strobe lights. The rain freeze-frames in the flashes, appearing to dance, and even fall upwards towards the ceiling.

      "bodyText": "Walking through Kensington Gardens in central London on a spring afternoon, things are poking through the soil, there's blossom on the ornamental cherry trees and obscene, sticky sci-fi buds bursting on the boughs of the chestnuts. Nature's at it again. But it isn't natural, is it? The squirrels the kids coo over are American imports that have killed off our native species. The cormorants perched on the posts in the lake shouldn't be inland, but have nothing left to eat in the North Sea. There's almost nothing natural about the park - not the artfully placed stands of trees, the acres of greensward, or the carefully managed stands of bankside reeds. The Greenhouse Effect, an international exhibition about nature and artifice at the gardens' Serpentine Gallery, made me think about all this. The guest curator, Ralph Rugoff, has filled the galleries with a simulated riot of nature. Walking into the climate-controlled, gravity-defying upside- down rainforest of exotic greenery that grows from the ceiling and fills one of the Serpentine's spaces, I conclude, reluctantly, that Kew Gardens has more to offer. Bringing the outside inside is one of contemporary art's more persistent cliches. It is difficult to see The Greenhouse Effect as anything other than a sampling of the many artists whose work is in some way concerned with our relationship to nature. The hard part, of course, is to say anything meaningful about the relationship, rather than indulging in a lot of hand-wringing about despoliation and mystic clap-trap about our being part of, rather than apart from, the natural world. Mark Dion's catalogue manifesto, consisting of notes on the ethical relationship between the artist and the environment, try to map out a territory of action, but like all manifestos, it veers between the goody-goody and the apopleptic. Many of the artists here - too many, in fact - simply copy nature, not to show how close we are to it, but to point up the schism between the natural world and human artifice.

      "body": "<p> <strong> We're not signing them...</strong><br> The Bidding War is one of the hardy perennials of the record industry. In Britain, where musical activity is concentrated around a cluster of London-based record companies, everybody quickly finds out exactly what everyone else is doing, and which acts are being eyed up by whom. Every successful act, whether it's Oasis, the Spice Girls or Take That, instantly breeds its own school of imitators as the A&amp;R scouts - the artist and repertoire scouts, almost always men, who decide which acts their company should sign - try to make lightning strike twice, or 25 times. With swarms of talent-spotters trying to sign up the same handful of artists, the asking price rapidly balloons to lunatic proportions. </p> <p>Partly this is human nature. \"It is a hothouse,\" confirms Steve Allen, who runs the pop and dance label Eternal under the sprawling multinational umbrella of WEA. \"With something like garage music, which is happening at the moment, there's always the fear factor of missing out. It was like Britpop or drum'n'bass acts - every company had to have one. Most successful A&amp;R guys are specialists in some area, but if they start dabbling elsewhere just because they're terrified of missing something that everybody else has got, it helps to stoke it up.\" </p> <p>The boom in garage records has prodded the feeding-frenzy issue into the spotlight once again. In this case, \"garage\" doesn't mean rock'n'roll scruffs playing ancient Ramones riffs alongside the lawn mower and the Black &amp; Decker Workmate. Instead it's the latest incarnation of ultimate dance cool, epitomised by discs like Artful Dodger's Rewind and Movin' Too Fast and DJ Luck &amp; MC Neat's A Little Bit of Luck. The industry journal Music Week recently noted how garage's emergence from the underground \"is leading to expensive bidding wars from major labels keen to capitalise on the trend.\" </p> <p>Christian Tattersfield, managing director of East West records, obligingly owns up to the fact that \"me and every joker\" are\"fighting away, paying too much\". But never mind - even if these records turn out to have all the upward mobility of a lead-lined breezeblock, they can always be bundled together onto a compilation album, which will sell on the strength of a couple of headlining hits. </p> <p>In the long run, however, putting the emphasis on cash over creativity doesn't do anybody any favours. Tony Portelli, managing director of cutting-edge garage label 4 Liberty, is exasperated by the tactics of the major companies. \"Ninety per cent of the time the major labels get it wrong,\" he fumes. \"They'll pay 150 grand for a single that sounds like it's from our scene, but then they'll spend as much as that marketing it to make it a hit because they have to chase that money. When it gets to number one, you've got the whole country singing along to a record that's awful, and it's seen as coming out of the UK garage scene. That's what we're worried about.\" </p> <p>Portelli espouses the classic indie-with-integrity ethos for his label - \"forward thinking A&amp;R and long term artist development by independents will always match or better the majors and their cherry-picking tactics,\" he reasons - and he eulogises the potential of garage music like a man who has not only seen the promised land, but has already bought himself some real estate. \"I think for the first time since Soul II Soul 10 years ago, Britain has really got something to shout about,\" he claims. \"There's already a lot of club play of this music in America. If it's song-led and artist-led, it'll come through positively.\" </p> <p>Portelli happens to be talking about garage music, but his attitude is an echo of many independent music-makers down the decades. From classic independent labels like Island or Atlantic to Rough Trade or Factory, the idea has always been to put the music first and let the artists develop at their own organic pace. </p> <p>Most current A&amp;R men aren't like the cocaine-addled buffoon with the bottomless expense account waving the corporate chequebook of popular mythology. The business will no longer tolerate the financial excesses of the 70s, when even journalists were showered with endless record company largesse. \"The industry's much more businesslike,\" reckons Steve Allen. \"We're run by accountants, aren't we? But I still think you need a little bit of arrogance and self-confidence, otherwise you couldn't do the job.\" </p> <p>Nor, however, do they fit the image of the pioneering years of the record business, when the A&amp;R man was a sympathetic character who made sure musicians were looked after financially and encouraged to do their best artistically. </p> <p>And, despite Tony Portelli's optimism, finding artists who will be able to sustain a 10-year career looks increasingly like a game of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey. It's every A&amp;R man's dream to find an act like Radiohead, that will evolve over several albums, but they all accept that the industry's ever-shorter attention span and bias towards instant gratification make it decreasingly likely. \"This year's Brit awards was sad, but it was a fair reflection of the year we had,\" says Steve Allen brutally. \"We've got too many micro-celebrities and manufactured acts with not enough talent. What I find really disturbing and unhealthy is the way we pick up soap stars and make records with them.\" </p> <p>Mark Fox, A&amp;R consultant at RCA, notes the ways the A&amp;R man's role has changed since he abandoned the musician's life (he used to be in Haircut 100, 80s champions of the cheesy grin and the chunky sweater.) He's well aware of the dance-records-and-compilations syndrome, but also stresses that the airbrushing and pre-packaging of pop acts has reached epidemic proportions. </p> <p>\"You find artists like Westlife or B*witched appearing more consistently, the auditioning, the honing down, the finding a marketing opportunity. You could say 'well that used to happen with Motown or the Monkees', but back then it used to be an aberration. Now it's a mainstay of the music industry.\" </p> <p>Fox admits that his personal tastes in music run to \"obscure Brazilian music and wild and reckless Norwegian free-form jazz\", but he hopes that this kind of uneasy listening helps him bring \"something left of centre to projects I'm working on. If I go home and listen to Five or Westlife, then I don't know what benefit I am to the process.\" </p> <p>The online revolution which is starting to shake up the music business threatens to put increasing pressure on the big record companies, because it may offer independent labels a means to discover and develop artists without the need for the marketing and distribution facilities the majors can offer. Yet, simultaneously, the internet could offer the business a route back to the disenfranchised older listeners it has increasingly lost touch with. </p> <p>\"If there's a Q magazine website or a clickmusic.com that's suggesting musical possibilities, then that's quite invigorating, because it empowers those people to make decisions about music without suffering the embarrassment of going to a record shop,\" Fox believes. \"I'm 41, and if somebody says to me 'you're old, therefore you'll like Leonard Cohen', they've completely misunderstood me. Now the whole online marketing strategy of harvesting data and getting people reacquainted with music is no bad thing.\" </p> <p>It's a larcenous concept - older listeners seeking artists who offer artistic maturity and continuity gallop to the rescue of the ailing, infantile pop biz.

      "bodyText": "We're not signing them... The Bidding War is one of the hardy perennials of the record industry. In Britain, where musical activity is concentrated around a cluster of London-based record companies, everybody quickly finds out exactly what everyone else is doing, and which acts are being eyed up by whom. Every successful act, whether it's Oasis, the Spice Girls or Take That, instantly breeds its own school of imitators as the A&amp;R scouts - the artist and repertoire scouts, almost always men, who decide which acts their company should sign - try to make lightning strike twice, or 25 times. With swarms of talent-spotters trying to sign up the same handful of artists, the asking price rapidly balloons to lunatic proportions. Partly this is human nature. \"It is a hothouse,\" confirms Steve Allen, who runs the pop and dance label Eternal under the sprawling multinational umbrella of WEA. \"With something like garage music, which is happening at the moment, there's always the fear factor of missing out. It was like Britpop or drum'n'bass acts - every company had to have one. Most successful A&amp;R guys are specialists in some area, but if they start dabbling elsewhere just because they're terrified of missing something that everybody else has got, it helps to stoke it up.\" The boom in garage records has prodded the feeding-frenzy issue into the spotlight once again. In this case, \"garage\" doesn't mean rock'n'roll scruffs playing ancient Ramones riffs alongside the lawn mower and the Black &amp; Decker Workmate. Instead it's the latest incarnation of ultimate dance cool, epitomised by discs like Artful Dodger's Rewind and Movin' Too Fast and DJ Luck &amp; MC Neat's A Little Bit of Luck.
