Nick Malinoff, who has to cope with an alcoholic mother, an absentee father and a crippled uncle, sees a way out when an estuary villain offers him the chance to do a spot of London arson.

To a no-hoper like Nick, who earns his living in a local car showroom, the West End seems as glamorous as Moscow did to Chekhov's three sisters. His chum Dougie, a Mephistopheles of the Essex marshes, also accurately embodies a certain kind of intransigent Thatcherite selfhood. </p> <p>As an actor himself, Whithouse knows how to write juicy dialogue. He's less good on the mechanics of plot: you feel it's a mistake to keep the Russian mother as a disembodied off-stage voice, and for the cafe to lack visible customers. The play's moral dilemma, hingeing on whether his brother and uncle should shop Nick to the cops, is also sketched in, rather than fully debated. </p> <p>But the play earns its keep through its social accuracy and evocation of seaside desperation. Jonathan Lloyd's production is well acted by Justin Salinger as the Porsche-hungry Nick, Paul Chequer as his hero-worshipping younger brother and Robin Soans as the Russian uncle who represents old immigrant values.

Back in the good old days a binman was a binman, and anyone who thought otherwise was just pretentious or humourlessly PC. Even 20 years ago, it was a hackneyed joke that road cleaners with ideas above their station would describe themselves as sanitation technicians. All very self-important and bathetic, like calling a spade a manual rotivation implement. </p> <p>These days, however, we're all at it. Don't like telling people at dinner parties that it's your job to do the photocopying? Why not describe yourself as a \"reprographics engineer\". Spend your days tapping into a screen? Your CV probably reads something like \"technical systems envisioner\". Say it with confidence, and the chances are your fellow dinner party guests will be impressed enough not to press you for an explanation. At which point, of course, you would have to mumble, \"Um, it's something in IT.\" </p> <p>In the new working world nobody wants a traditional job title. Traditional job titles are static things, prescriptive and limiting. They put us in boxes and remind us we're not quite where we'd promised ourselves we'd be by this stage in our life. What we want instead is a string of active verbs, the longer the better; zingy, non-specific names which, when translated, mean something like \"hands-on doer\" or \"really busy person\". </p> <p>It may seem largely cosmetic, but the title under which one works is enormously important to staff morale. This week a survey reported that 70% of office workers would be prepared to forgo a pay rise for the sake of a more \"motivational\" title. Given that the humble tea lady can be instantly promoted to \"catering supervisor\" without a change in function - and without an increase in pay - it's not difficult to see why increasing numbers of employers are happy to go along with the new workplace nomenclature. </p> <p>It's not only about making people in work feel happier about the job they are doing. Recruitment consultants admit that they often advise client companies to change details of job specifications to improve the chances of filling the position. \"People want to go into the roles, but they are not always so keen when the roles have titles that are traditionally quite junior,\" says Jane Littlefield of Joslin Rowe, a City recruitment specialist. She adds that the company routinely advertises for \"desk assistants\", \"team administrators\" and \"information co-ordinators\" - each of which would have been called team secretary a few years ago. \"It's partly supply and demand,\" she says. \"There's lots of jobs out there, and people don't want to do something that sounds lowly. We can really sell a job on the basis that it's called something that sounds impressive.\" </p> <p>It may largely involve cosmetic tweaking, but the stigma frequently attached to traditional job titles can cause real problems in recruitment. This week the Royal College of Physicians recommended that a new role of \"health care practitioner\" should be created, in part to fill the yawning gap caused by a crisis in nursing recruitment. </p> <p>\"The problem is that nursing does not attract many men or ethnic minorities,\" says Professor Michael Orme, chairman of the working party that produced the report. \"The term 'nursing' puts them off.\" Health care practitioner, the logic goes, sounds a bit more technical and less girlie than nurse, and would be more likely to appeal to techie blokes and manual workers willing to retrain - even though the role, requiring two years' training instead of three, would actually carry less responsibility than that of a basic RN. </p> <p>The Americans, of course, are a step ahead in imaginative job titles: there one can find \"growth officers\", \"reality facilitators\" and the intriguingly named \"vibe envisagers\" if one looks hard enough. A Virginia-based marketing company, Play, is a pioneer: all staff choose their own titles, resulting in a \"check, please\", a \"whatif\" and a \"Houston we've got a problem\". The idea is to make everyone feel part of the creative process, whereas traditional titles can divide people into creative and non-creative roles. The ice-cream company Ben and Jerry's also allows workers to pick their own titles: you can be \"flavourmeister\" or \"serving supremo\" if you so wish. The jokey irony - and the point of it - is that you work for an ice-cream company and your job is to make or serve ice-cream. Supremo is certainly better than server, especially if you're not getting paid a whole lot to do it. </p> <p>\"Our work is how we identify ourselves,\" says Ben Williams, a chartered occupational psychologist based in Edinburgh. \"As soon as we hear what a person's job is, we stereotype them. As jobs are getting more and more computerised and electronically controlled, so we are becoming more like battery hens serving the system.\" More imaginative job titles, he suggests, are a way of asserting one's individuality and indispensability. </p> <p>Cynicism doesn't entirely explain it, however. The workplace has changed dramatically in the past couple of decades, says Littlefield, and people are simply not doing the same jobs as they were 20 years ago. \"Secretaries are still seen as very junior roles,\" she says. \"Even the term PA, which lots of junior workers once aspired to, has connotations of 'take a memo Miss Jones'. The fact is that workplace hierarchies are very much flatter these days - managers will do a lot of their own admin, and support workers will be doing management-type jobs.\" Aside from carrying an element of stigma, many traditional titles are simply inaccurate in describing what today's workers actually do. </p> <p>Michael Wolff, founder and \"head of imagination\" at the Fourth Room, thinks the workplace pecking order can be done away with altogether by being a bit more creative about the titles used for staff. \"It's incredibly important to break down hierarchy, as I think it is demeaning to people - and not just junior people. I have seen people really demeaned by the title of managing director in a company in which they are not the CEO, where the title is offered as an excuse to pay them less. By the time you are a 'chairman', for instance, your title says that you are good at running meetings. That's nonsense. The point of language is to energise, not to put a label and a limit on things.\" </p> <p>But he will admit he hasn't always got it right. \"Some of the titles we have are wrong. They veer into being witty for the sake of it, and that isn't the point. The point is to affirm people in what they are there to do.\" Pocock for one isn't entirely convinced about being a \"members only\". \"My title is difficult because it encompasses so much.

Nonetheless, the prime minister, who is holding individual meetings with all sides this afternoon, ruled out an early breakthrough in the deadlock over decommissioning and devolution.</p> <p>\"When people say that the Good Friday agreement is in tatters, it is nonsense,\" he insisted this morning. \"The basis of the Good Friday agreement remains.\" He added that the issue of public confidence in decommissioning \"still had to be dealt with\". Mr Blair, who will meet the Irish premier Bertie Ahern in Dublin this evening, along with Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson, said he would keep trying to make the peace process work but was anxious not to raise expectations of an imminent deal.</p> <p>He said: \"I think we all know to raise expectations would be wrong because there are really difficult issues to work through. I just want to emphasise to people that I am here to listen and to talk to people, to learn what the concerns are and to go back over the ground again.\" Meanwhile, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble insisted that Mr Blair must obtain guarantees from the IRA that they will decommission.</p> <p>\"The obligations [of the republican movement] were set out clearly in the agreement, obligations which we expected when we formed the administration were part of the Mitchell Review that they would honour and they have failed to do so. That is why we are here,\" he said as he arrived at Hillsborough Castle for talks with the prime minister.</p> <p>Mr Trimble's party has voted to link any return to power sharing with republicans to the retention of the Royal Ulster Constabulary name, which the government has ruled out. Sinn Fein will urge the government to restore the suspended power sharing Stormont executive.</p> <p>There is no sign that the Provisionals are prepared to give up their weapons and it seems extremely unlikely there will be any progress before May 22, the date by which the agreement anticipates disarmament could be completed.</p> <p>Anti-agreement UK unionist leader Robert McCartney, who was not meeting Mr Blair today, said the prime minister's previous promises on decommissioning remained \"dishonoured and unfulfilled\". He added: \"There are no words in any language which are a substitute for actual deeds of decommissioning.\"</p> <p>SDLP leader John Hume today revealed that his party had put forward its own proposals for an implementation plan to resolve the political impasse. These consisted of the two governments indicating how they would fully implement the Patten report on policing; reform of the criminal justice system; guarantee human rights and equality and achieve normalisation in Northern Ireland by scaling down militarisation.</p> <p>The party also called for a pro-Good Friday agreement party to affirm a commitment to taking part in the operation of all devolved institutions and to work constructively and in good faith with the international disarmament commission to achieve decommissioning.</p> <p>Mr Hume said his party's proposals had been well received by the prime minister.</p> <p>Sinn Fein's Conor Murphy said before meeting the prime minister that his party would be protesting against the decision to suspend the political institutions at Stormont in February.

      "bodyText": "The Good Friday agreement is still the \"only show in town\", Tony Blair said today as he arrived in Northern Ireland to try and revive the ailing peace process. Nonetheless, the prime minister, who is holding individual meetings with all sides this afternoon, ruled out an early breakthrough in the deadlock over decommissioning and devolution. \"When people say that the Good Friday agreement is in tatters, it is nonsense,\" he insisted this morning. \"The basis of the Good Friday agreement remains.\" He added that the issue of public confidence in decommissioning \"still had to be dealt with\". Mr Blair, who will meet the Irish premier Bertie Ahern in Dublin this evening, along with Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson, said he would keep trying to make the peace process work but was anxious not to raise expectations of an imminent deal. He said: \"I think we all know to raise expectations would be wrong because there are really difficult issues to work through. I just want to emphasise to people that I am here to listen and to talk to people, to learn what the concerns are and to go back over the ground again.\" Meanwhile, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble insisted that Mr Blair must obtain guarantees from the IRA that they will decommission. \"The obligations [of the republican movement] were set out clearly in the agreement, obligations which we expected when we formed the administration were part of the Mitchell Review that they would honour and they have failed to do so. That is why we are here,\" he said as he arrived at Hillsborough Castle for talks with the prime minister. Mr Trimble's party has voted to link any return to power sharing with republicans to the retention of the Royal Ulster Constabulary name, which the government has ruled out. Sinn Fein will urge the government to restore the suspended power sharing Stormont executive. There is no sign that the Provisionals are prepared to give up their weapons and it seems extremely unlikely there will be any progress before May 22, the date by which the agreement anticipates disarmament could be completed. Anti-agreement UK unionist leader Robert McCartney, who was not meeting Mr Blair today, said the prime minister's previous promises on decommissioning remained \"dishonoured and unfulfilled\". He added: \"There are no words in any language which are a substitute for actual deeds of decommissioning.\" SDLP leader John Hume today revealed that his party had put forward its own proposals for an implementation plan to resolve the political impasse. These consisted of the two governments indicating how they would fully implement the Patten report on policing; reform of the criminal justice system; guarantee human rights and equality and achieve normalisation in Northern Ireland by scaling down militarisation. The party also called for a pro-Good Friday agreement party to affirm a commitment to taking part in the operation of all devolved institutions and to work constructively and in good faith with the international disarmament commission to achieve decommissioning. Mr Hume said his party's proposals had been well received by the prime minister. Sinn Fein's Conor Murphy said before meeting the prime minister that his party would be protesting against the decision to suspend the political institutions at Stormont in February. The Newry and Armagh MLA said: \"We also intend to seek some certainty from Mr Blair that the British government will not suspend the institutions again as a result of a unionist veto if they are re-established.\" Mr Trimble said after his meeting that Mr Blair \"was not in a position to outline to us any specific proposals or to give the details about the matters that have been discussed in the background.\" \"Our impression is that it has not yet reached any degree of precision, which is why I hope that in the course of these discussions later today that republicans will make it clear to the government what they are going to do and when they are going to do it,\" he added.",

      "body": "<p><strong>1</strong> Gianluca Vialli has picked a relatively defensive midfield in Dennis Wise, Didier Deschamps, Jody Morris and Roberto di Matteo - there's no room for Gustavo Poyet or Dan Petrescu, both of whom are on the bench. Meanwhile, Patrick Kluivert is back in the Barca side, despite a running dispute with boss Louis Van Gaal, and captain Josep Guardiola, Michael Reiziger and Boudewijn Zenden all return with him. Barca kick off in front of a capacity 98,000 Nou Camp crowd. There's a bit of an atmosphere.<br> <strong>1 </strong> Albert Ferrer is booked for not much. He'll miss the next game if Chelsea progress.<br> <strong>2 </strong> Rivaldo sends Figo free down the right - nearly a good cross but it sails out for a goal kick.<br> <strong>4 </strong>Philip Cocu finds Zenden on the left - Ferrer sweeps up.<br> <strong>4 </strong>Rivaldo walks past Morris as though the Chelsea youngster isn't there. He sweeps a Beckhamesque ball out to Zenden - his cross is useless. This time.<br> <strong>5 </strong> Zenden feeds Cocu down the left - the Dutchman swings a wonderful ball which just evades the lunging Kluivert.<br> <strong>8 </strong> Chelsea buy some time - Flo and Di Matteo win a free kick between them. Ferrer's free kick finds Flo near the right-hand corner flag, but Puyol nips in to wheech the ball away.<br> <strong>9 </strong> Figo runs ominously at Babayaro, who fortunately wins a free kick. Chelsea rocking down the flanks. In a different way, so are Barca.<br> <strong>11 </strong> Kluivert flicks to Rivaldo. Who flicks out wide to Zenden. Who flicks the ball past Ferrer and slides in a cross which is only just knocked away by Leboeuf.<br> <strong>12 </strong> Figo cuts in from the right and charges towards the penalty area. He plays an adroit one-two with a back-to-goal Kluivert and is upended in the box by Desailly. Fairly, as it turns out.<br> <strong>14 </strong> Morris, Zola and Deschamps keep hold of the ball for all of ten seconds. The home side are harrying Chelsea very well indeed.<br> <strong>16 </strong> Flo wins a high ball and flicks out to the onrushing Zola - he misses the chance of a volley but wins a throw. From it, Chelsea win a free kick. It's scrappy and it comes to nothing, but it causes a brief flurry of bother in the Barca box. A useful couple of minutes for the Chelse, who are breaking up Barca's slick play for a while at least.<br> <strong>20 </strong> Good possession from Barca, but they can't get the ball out to the flanks - where they look dangerous - at the moment. <br> <strong>20 </strong> The cheekiest moment of the night so far as Babayaro throws a saucy dummy in his own box to calmly clear a through ball.<br> <strong>22 </strong> It's catching - Rivaldo diddles Leboeuf with a fancy hip shimmy - clear space. His piledriver flies high and wide to De Goey's left.<br> <strong>24 GOAL Barcelona 1 - 0 Chelsea</strong> A foolish Deschamps lunge on Rivaldo gives Barca a free-kick in the centre 25 yards out. Rivaldo welts it left to right around the wall - it pings back to the left off Babayaro's head, wrongfoots De Goey and bounces into an empty net. At the same time, someone switches the Nou Camp \"on\".<br> <strong>28 </strong> De Goey comes to punch a looping cross - he meets it but sends it in the direction of the onrushing Zenden. Luckily his hoof is too high and flies over the bar.<br> <strong>30 </strong> Figo sends Deschamps one way and then the other. He rolls the ball out wide to Kluivert whose cross is slid out for a corner. The most composed Chelsea defending since the goal sees the corner easily cleared.<br> <strong>32 </strong> Flo is sent a ball to chase down the right wing - he bravely wins it but there's no support. Puyol eventually runs away, cackling.<br> <strong>33 </strong> Desailly takes charge - he barges Zenden out of the way and storms up the pitch. His belief sparks the best Chelsea move so far - Wise, Flo and Morris knock it about for a bit, allowing Morris a shot. It's off target, but that's better.<br> <strong>34 </strong> Cocu, in no trouble, passes back to Hesp - Ferrer charges down the keeper's clearance. Goal kick. Are Chelsea picking their game up?<br> <strong>40 </strong> Perhaps - because Chelsea win a corner. Zola sends it in only for Hesp to flap under it. Flo meets the ball at the far post but misses the empty net. A real chance.<br> <strong>43 </strong>Babayaro concedes a corner under no pressure. From it, Desailly gets him out of jail with a towering header. <br> <strong>45 GOAL Barcelona 2 - 0 Chelsea</strong> With time running out in the first half, Figo, coming in from the left, makes a late dash into Chelsea territory. He turns the entire away defence inside out to create space in the box, and passes to Kluivert, waiting on the edge of the area. The ex-Ajax man hammers a real pearler against the base of De Goey's right-hand post - it comes arrowing straight back out to Figo, who calmly takes two touches to make some room for himself and passes the ball into an empty net.<br> <strong>45 </strong> Figo's goal is the last kick of the half. Chelsea must now score to stay in the competition.<br></p> <p><strong>46 </strong> Chelsea set the ball rolling for the second half. Lambourde on for Ferrer. For some reason, Wise is now a bit uptight - he hacks down Rivaldo. From the free kick, Figo whips in a cross which is missed by Leboeuf and sails towards Kluivert, two yards out. Luckily, the Dutchman didn't think the Chelsea defender would miss the ball and it bounces off his shins to safety.<br> <strong>47 </strong> Wise, the feisty little fella, now flies in on Cocu. Yellow card. Yawn.<br> <strong>49 </strong> Rivaldo is left to run free down the centre. He beats Leboeuf to the left is one-on-one with De Goey... who saves! It's a brilliant smother to keep Chelsea in the game.<br> <strong>51 </strong> Wise finds space down the right. His shot is easily dealt with by Hesp. But it's a good move. A minute later, Babayaro is found in acres down the same channel - have Chelsea spotted something?<br> <strong>52 </strong> Figo slides in on Deschamps and earns a booking - if Barca progress he's out of the semi-final first leg.<br> <strong>54 </strong>Leboeuf nearly finds Zola with a long ball through the middle. Chelsea are looking more creative this half - which is not difficult, granted.<br> <strong>56 </strong> Lambourde finds Flo in the box with a high ball. It's hacked away. Lambourde gets on the ball again and sends in an equally dangerous cross - Wise nearly digs it out from under his feet on the penalty spot. Again it's cleared but Chelsea are at last showing some form.<br> <strong>60 GOAL Barcelona 2 - 1 Chelsea</strong> Chelsea are back in the box seat. Zola chases a backpass and presses Hesp who passes straight to Flo, waiting on the right-hand corner of the area. There's still work to be done, but Flo beats Puyol with his first touch and curls the ball left to right past Hesp into the net. How important is De Goey's save now?<br> <strong>63 </strong> Reizeger goes on a run and is denied brilliantly by De Goey, who tips away. From the corner, Kluivert smashes a brilliant header against the bar. It's the luck you need...<br> <strong>67 </strong> Barca pass it about for a bit but they're being pushed back by a determined Chelsea midfield whose improvement is nothing short of outstanding.<br> <strong>70 </strong> Zenden cuts infield just like Figo did before half-time for his goal - this time, the Chelsea defence take a deep breath and work hard to close him down.<br> <strong>73 </strong>Dani on for Zenden. <br> <strong>74 </strong>Zola, out on the right, pushes the ball infield to Morris, who rolls the ball into the path of Di Matteo out on the left. He's clear but he tries to shift the ball onto his right foot. Too late - his hectic poke is smothered for a corner. Is this Chelsea's Rivaldo moment? <br> <strong>77 </strong> Figo whips in a free kick from the left which evades the entire Chelsea defence and finds Dani free on the far post. It's his first touch since coming on and he can't miss. What an effective substitution. For Chelsea, that is - he heads wide when it was easier to score.<br> <strong>80 </strong> Almost a re-run. It's not a free kick this time, but Figo turns in a wonderful cross from the same area - Dani meets it well this time but his header is turned around the post by De Goey.<br> <strong>82 </strong> Di Matteo and Babayaro work well to feed Flo, who is found offside when there's really no need to be. Chelsea inviting more pressure on themselves.<br> <strong>83 GOAL Barcelona 3 - 1 Chelsea </strong> From the free kick, Barca move upfield and win another. Guardiola floats in a set piece which Dani heads in off Desailly's chest. Extra time looms.<br> <strong>85 Barca miss penalty</strong> A magnificent through ball finds Kluivert free in the middle of the box. He's hacked down by Leboeuf but still pokes the ball into the net while prone. No matter - the referee has already blown for a penalty so it won't count. Rivaldo, the best player in the world, steps up to take the spot kick, sends De Goey, who dives to his left, the wrong way and... blasts the ball wide of the left-hand post. <br> <strong>89 </strong> Kluivert nearly converts Figo's right-wing cross but De Goey catches well. How often does a last-minute attempt at goal seem like a breather from the action?<br> <strong>90 </strong> Hesp turns a Di Matteo shot around his post for a corner. Flo nearly meets it but Rivaldo clears by playing keepy-uppy. After a penalty miss you've got to admire that.<br> <strong>90 </strong> Full time. There will be another 30 minutes to decide this one. Phew.<br></p> <p><strong>91 </strong> It's off again.<br> <strong>93 </strong> Wise nearly nips between Cocu and Hesp to lob in an unlikely goal.<br> <strong>94 </strong> Lambourde loses the ball in his own area - Figo beats his lunge to smash the ball goalwards. De Goey stands up well to save his team-mate's blushes.<br> <strong>97 GOAL Barcelona 4 - 1 Chelsea </strong> Figo runs straight through the heart of the Chelsea defence. It's an amazing weaving run which evades three men - but not Babayaro's penalty-box lunge. It's a penalty and Babayaro is sent off. Rivaldo steps up to take the kick and... we've been here before... rolls it where he meant to roll it the first time - inside the left-hand post. You've got to admire his courage.<br> <strong>101 </strong> Petrescu on for Deschamps.<br> <strong>103 </strong> Di Matteo bundles Abelardo off the ball and feeds Morris on the edge of the area - he hits a lovely daisy cutter which is on target and well held by Hesp.<br> <strong>104 GOAL Barcelona 5 - 1 Chelsea</strong> Dani skins the skin-headed Leboeuf down the right - his cross is perfectly on the head of Kluivert, who makes no mistake in dispatching the ball past an unguarded De Goey. It's all over now, surely.<br> <strong>105 </strong> Sergi on for Reizeger.<br></p> <p><strong>106 </strong> The last throw of the dice for Chelsea - Poyet on for an exhausted Zola.<br> <strong>108 </strong> Well they're trying. Wise gets after a hopeful up-and-under, lets the ball drop over his shoulder and volleys towards goal - Hesp parries. Within a minute, Leboeuf hammers in another shot - another excellent parry from Hesp.<br> <strong>110 </strong> A real feeling that Chelsea are finally spent after nearly two hours of battle - Barca are indulging in some keep ball.<br> <strong>116 </strong> De Goey makes yet another superlative save to keep the score down - Rivaldo lays a chance on for Dani, who looks to chip the advancing keeper. No dice.<br> <strong>117 </strong> Wise in 'deep discussion' with Figo.<br> <strong>120 </strong> Petrescu finds space down the right and finds Flo. A final chance to create some drama? No - Flo is penalised for pushing and the final whistle follows apace.

      "bodyText": "Hours after a second farmer was killed in Zimbabwe's land dispute, President Robert Mugabe today described white landowners as \"enemies of our people\" who wanted to \"reverse our revolution and our independence\". In his pre-recorded television address - to mark the 20th anniversary of independence - the president promised to redistribute the country's best farmland and failed to order war veterans to end their sometimes violent occupation of white-owned land. Mr Mugabe also signed into law a constitutional amendment adopted by his parliament 10 days ago that allows him to take white-owned farms without paying compensation. The president's televised speech offered two vastly different messages. In the first, English version Mr Mugabe expressed regret for the deaths but said white farmers' resistance to land reform had \"created frustrations leading to the current spate of farm occupations\". He said he was talking to the farmers and the war veterans to try to solve the crisis. In a second version of the speech, delivered in Zimbabwe's native Shona language, Mr Mugabe thanked the war veterans for moving on to the farms. He said that the white farmers should not have opposed a constitutional referendum in February that would have allowed the state to seize their land without paying compensation. The referendum failed and squatters, led by veterans of Zimbabwe's independence war, began occupying the land soon afterwards. \"They have behaved as enemies of Zimbabwe, and I told them that we were full of anger. The entire community is angry and that's why they have the war vets seizing land,\" said Mr Mugabe, who met the farm leaders yesterday. \"I told them it requires real transformations on their part in a positive way for us to accept them as allies wanting to live side by side and until then we will continue to regard them as enemies of our people.\" The farmer who died this morning was Martin Olds, 42, who was shot and beaten by a crowd that moved on to his land in the early hours. The wounded Mr Olds called for help on a radio, but his besiegers kept medical workers away until it was too late, said David Hasluck, director of the Commercial Farmers' Union, which represents white farmers. Three days ago squatters shot dead David Stevens, a white farmer and supporter of the Movement for Democratic Change, the main opposition party. Five other farmers who tried to help him were severely beaten. The murder of Mr Olds was condemned by Britain's foreign minister Peter Hain, who said the death showed that the crisis in Zimbabwe was \"spiralling out of control\". But Mr Mugabe blamed Britain for many of his country's woes and accused Labour of reneging on promises made by the previous Conservative party administration. Mr Hain and foreign secretary Robin Cook were also criticised for \"inaction\" by the Tories, who urged the government to seek the urgent help of the Commonwealth in finding a peaceful solution to the violence in Zimbabwe. Mr Hain today told the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee that Mr Mugabe had indicated to fellow African leaders that he might be willing to accept Commonwealth observers at the coming elections, whose date he has not yet announced. The foreign minister welcomed the development and said that Britain would be happy to supply observers to any international monitoring body. He dismissed as \"knee-jerk gestures\" calls for sanctions against Zimbabwe and for its suspension from the Commonwealth, and condemned what he termed \"inflammatory\" language from the Conservative party. He said Britain acknowledges that there is \"massive unfairness\" in land distribution in Zimbabwe - with 4,400 white farmers owning 30% of agricultural land - and is ready to discuss what aid it can give to the land reform process. But there was no pot of money set aside for the Zimbabwean authorities to claim and no question of Britain simply providing compensation for land seizures.",

      "body": "<p>Britain has a long tradition of providing hospitality to men, women and children fleeing persecution. From Flemish Protestants seeking refuge from Spanish rule, to the Huguenots a century later, to the French \u00e9migr\u00e9s escaping the guillotine, to the thousands of Jews escaping Russian pogroms and persecution in eastern Europe in the late nineteenth century, this country has given a safe home to people in fear of their lives.</p> <p>Not every refugee who came to our shores admired Britain's own social order or political institutions. Karl Marx dreamed of world revolution in the sanctuary of the Reading Room of the British Museum. But then, as Isaiah Berlin observed, in Britain \"foreign revolutionaries were on the whole left unmolested, provided they behaved themselves in an orderly and inconspicuous manner.\"</p> <p>This tradition is rightly a source of national pride and it has also brought important benefits to our country. When Nazi tyranny drove many European Jews to our shores, Britain became home to some of the foremost mathematicians, scientists, historians and musicians of the age.</p> <p>Even in my own lifetime, we saw the arrival here of tens of thousands of Ugandan Asians, refugees from the dictatorship of Idi Amin. Ted Heath's decision that we keep our promise and let them settle here was brave, honourable and right. And those refugees from Uganda, with their skills, enterprise and diligence have contributed enormously to the prosperity and cultural and political life of our country.</p> <p>There is Tarique Ghaffur, the Deputy Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police; Asif Din, the former Warwickshire cricketer; Manubhai Madhvani, the fantastically successful industrialist; and our own prospective parliamentary candidate in Northampton, Shailesh Vara.</p> <p>Each new group of settlers has enriched our islands. Each has widened and advanced our sense of what it means to be British. And I am determined that we should never abandon our proud tradition of offering sanctuary to those who are fleeing injustice and wrong.</p> <p>Yet that tradition is now under threat as never before. Not because our people have lost their sense of hospitality; not because we are unwilling to honour our obligations to genuine refugees; least of all because the British people are racist or xenophobic. The problem confronting us is that a system to identify and protect refugees which was designed half a century ago is near collapse in today's utterly different world.</p> <p>In fact it was nearly 80 years ago that the first attempt was made to establish an international system to deal with refugee issues. In 1921 the League of Nations appointed the Norwegian explorer Nansen as its High Commissioner to help Russian refugees. In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency and, later, the International Refugee Organisation were established to find homes for the literally millions of displaced people in Europe.</p> <p>Finally, in 1951, the United Nations High Commission for Refugees came into being. In the same year, the Geneva Convention provided for the first time a universal definition of the term \"refugee\" in place of the previous international practice of trying to define and help particular national groups.</p> <p>It is worth noting that the authors of the 1951 Convention expected that the refugee crisis was capable of solution within a relatively short space of time. Refugee status could be claimed only in respect of events which had occurred before January 1st 1951. Countries ratifying the Convention could choose (and most did) to restrict their obligations to European refugees and the High Commissioner's mandate was originally limited to three years.</p> <p>Sadly, events have turned out otherwise. Despite the defeat of Nazism and the collapse of Soviet tyranny, political and religious persecution are as familiar today as in the world of 1951. In 1967, the Bellagio Protocol extended the provisions of the Convention to post-1951 events and to non-Europeans.</p> <p>The definition of a refugee included in the 1951 Convention is now accepted by practically every country in the world and it was written into British law through our 1993 Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act. Under the Convention, a refugee is someone who has a \" well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country\".</p> <p>The Convention goes on to list the obligations of states towards people who have been granted refugee status. Most important is the principle that a refugee may not be returned to a country where he or she risks persecution. Other articles of the Convention deal with such matters as identity documents, employment, education and welfare. In general, European countries, including Britain, have given refugees rights similar to those enjoyed by their own countrymen and it is precisely because the rights granted to refugees are so important and because we take our obligations to genuine refugees so seriously that the current breakdown in our asylum system matters so much.</p> <p>For most of the post-war era, the framework established in 1951 has worked well. Someone who had climbed the Berlin Wall, someone who had fled to the West after the Hungarian Uprising in 1956 or the suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968 clearly came within the scope of the Convention. The number of people seeking asylum was relatively small and cases were usually clear-cut.</p> <p>All that has now changed. Over the last dozen or so years, developments in communications have transformed the opportunities available not just for western businessmen or tourists but for economic migrants worldwide. Television has become the parish notice-board of the global village. People living in poor and unstable countries can watch images of the prosperity and relative security of life in Germany or Britain or the Netherlands every night of the week on their TV screens.</p> <p>Cheap mass air travel makes emigration a practical possibility for ever larger numbers of people. Global communications mean that you can look beyond the next town or even the next country. Migration across continents has become easier than at any time in human history.</p> <p>In Europe, these profound social and technological changes have taken place at the same time that the disintegration of the Soviet Empire has brought down the physical and political barriers to emigration. People no longer need to flee Warsaw or Sofia for fear of persecution but there is nothing now to stop them seeking to emigrate for economic reasons.</p> <p>Throughout Western Europe, the asylum system has proved a soft target for people trying to get round the usual immigration controls. Because the 1951 Convention imposes on each government a duty to assess every application on its merits, a claim for asylum has proved an effective way to gain temporary entry to another country and then to delay or avoid removal or deportation.</p> <p>The official Home Office statistics show that in 1988 there were just under 4,000 applications for asylum in this country. By 1996, the last full year before Labour took office, that figure stood at 29,000. Last year, the number of claims was more than 71,000.</p> <p>In fact, the Home Office figures understate the actual numbers since Britain, unlike virtually every other country in Europe, counts only heads of households and not their dependants. According to the UNHCR, the total number of people - including dependants - who claimed asylum in Britain in 1999 alone was more than 93,000.</p> <p>Most people who claim asylum in this country do not meet the test laid down by the Convention of having a \"well-founded fear of persecution\". The consistent pattern in recent years has been for between 70 and 80 per cent of claims to be refused as unfounded. The number of claims accepted as genuine has fluctuated from as little as 3 per cent in 1992 to as many as 17 per cent in 1998. There is a further group of applicants who, while not considered refugees, are granted a time-limited exceptional leave to remain because of political instability in their homeland.</p> <p>Last year the number of applicants accepted was much higher than usual - 36 per cent of the total. This was due to the exceptional circumstances of the crisis in Kosovo. Very large numbers of genuine refugees were accepted into Britain between April and July 1999 but by the end of the year the pattern had reverted to normal and in January of this year outright refusals accounted for nearly 90 per cent of all asylum decisions.</p> <p>In one sense it is hard to blame individual asylum seekers, however flimsy their case may sometimes be. There is nothing immoral or wrong about trying to seek a better life. Fleeing poverty may not be the same as fleeing persecution, but it is difficult to blame them. From their point of view, it is worth taking a chance. But we should be under no illusions about the extent to which this has now become an organised international traffic in human beings and an organised abuse of the asylum system.</p> <p>People are arriving in Britain armed with expert knowledge of how to exploit our asylum laws; what to say on arrival; how to string out appeals and how to remain here if their cases are eventually turned down.</p> <p>When I visited Heathrow a few months ago, Immigration Officers gave me one example of how the racket works. People arrive on a plane. They disembark and then hang around at the airport for many hours before presenting themselves at the Immigration Desk, often at a different terminal from the one where they landed. By this stage they have no passport or other identity documents. They then tell the Immigration Officer on duty that they wish to claim asylum.</p> <p>Until quite recently, passports and other documents which had been used by the passengers to get on board the flight in the first place, were destroyed between disembarkation and claiming asylum. Now, things are more professionally organised. The asylum seekers are accompanied on their flight by a rep - someone working for the racketeers who have planned the whole thing. He disembarks with them, collects up their documents, goes to the transit area and flies out again with a set of passports all ready to be used by future customers. That is the sort of thing that is actually going on.</p> <p>Some of the other activities of asylum racketeers are even more elaborate. For instance in the Autumn of last year stories emerged of people being sewn into the canvas sides of Channel Tunnel freight trains by teams of gangsters. Hardly able to move during a 48 hour trip from Milan to Britain the asylum seekers eventually escape by cutting a hole in the ceiling of the train. Tragically a number have been badly burned after touching overhead cables.</p> <p>A spokesman for the National Criminal Intelligence Service commented : \"Those being smuggled will be sold a package including travel, fraudulent visas and information on how to deal with immigration authorities and on claiming benefits when they arrive. To pay off the cost of the trip, they will be expected to work for tiny wages at jobs arranged for them in restaurant kitchens, as waitresses or even as prostitutes.\"</p> <p>By such routes, the long-standing hospitality and generosity of the British people is being systematically abused.</p> <p>I am the first to accept that the pressure on our asylum system did not start on 1 May 1997; but nor can anyone doubt that the crisis has grown much more acute since the present Government came to office. In the last full year of Conservative Government, the number of asylum applications fell by 40 per cent while the backlog of cases awaiting a decision was cut by 12,000.</p> <p>Since the General Election, both totals have doubled. The backlog of people waiting to have their case determined now stands at 103,000. At one point, the Home Office's internal systems for managing asylum casework broke down completely. Even the Permanent Secretary at the Home Office has been driven to admit, in evidence given to the Public Accounts Committee, that the situation was \"pretty desperate\"- language which Sir Humphrey would have considered shockingly candid.</p> <p>This month it was revealed that an Algerian asylum seeker who is living in Britain with his two wives and 15 children at taxpayers` expense is in fact a convicted terrorist.</p> <p>The Government has manifestly failed to get to grips with the situation. When they came to office, they reversed high-profile deportation decisions. They promised to abolish the list of countries from which applications could be fast tracked and did so in their 1999 Act.</p> <p>They said there would be no amnesties - but have allowed 15,000 asylum seekers to stay here regardless of the merits of their asylum claims. They said that the checks on illegal employment in the 1996 Act were racist. Then they said they were not racist and that they would implement them because illegal working was a growing problem. But there has been just one prosecution in the whole of the three years of this Government.</p> <p>The longer the queue, the worse the administrative confusion, the greater the incentive is for racketeers to target their efforts on Britain. There is a direct link between Government incompetence in managing asylum cases and the surge in applications to stay here.</p> <p>Nor is it convincing for the Government to wash their hands of responsibility by saying, as they do, that the problems are all due to international developments which they are powerless to control. The exodus of refugees from Kosovo affected every country in Europe. So why was it that in 1999 Germany and the Netherlands were able to reduce the number of applicants for asylum in their countries while applications in Britain rose by more than 50 per cent? The answer is that governments in those nations now have firm and effective policies to deter unfounded applications.</p> <p>As the Government has failed to meet its own targets for casework it has, unsurprisingly, exceeded by far its planned expenditure on support for asylum seekers whose cases are awaiting a decision. Planned central government spending of \u00a3350 million has turned into actual spending of at least \u00a3600 million a year. The total bill since 1997 now exceeds \u00a31.5 billion.</p> <p>Some local authorities are under acute pressure. The London Borough of Hillingdon, which covers Heathrow Airport, has to deal with the large number of unaccompanied children who arrive by air. In Kent, the county council has struggled to cope with the increase in the numbers of asylum seekers arriving at its ports. It has also had to add almost two million pounds to Council Tax Bills after the Government failed to reimburse them fully, just one example of how Council taxes in some areas have risen sharply to help pay for the cost . \"Westminster is spending more on supporting asylum seekers than on residential and nursing placements for elderly people.</p> <p>Finally, the Government have decided to 'phase in' new support measures that mean many local authorities such as Hillingdon and other London boroughs will continue to bear a heavy burden. And although the new measures have been extended in full to Kent, the county council will remain responsible for many thousands of asylum seekers who have already applied.</p> <p>The Government's new flagship reception centre at Oakington in Cambridgshire didn`t get off to a good start. Just a few days after it opened, six asylum seekers simply walked out - and at the end of last month just 32 people were having their claims processed there.</p> <p>Some commentators of the left acknowledge the truth of what is happening but then go on to argue that it does not much matter. \"Britain is a rich country,\" they say. \"We can cope with these numbers and, in any case, even 71,000 new asylum seekers in 1999 is a small number when seen in the context of a population of 60 million. After all, the great majority of genuine refugees and asylum seekers in the world are to be found not in Western Europe but in the developing world\".</p> <p>That is the critique and one aspect of it I accept. I readily acknowledge that many poor countries in Africa and Asia are indeed struggling to look after enormous numbers of people. Conflicts in Afghanistan, in Central Asia, in Rwanda, Congo and Sierra Leone have left many thousands of people living in refugee camps in neighbouring countries. One key objective of British foreign and international development policy must be to help the international relief agencies to house and feed these people and to do what lies within our power to bring about the conditions in which they are able to return safely to their homes.</p> <p>But of course the purpose of the 1951 Convention and the reason for the creation of the United Nations High Commission was precisely to put in place international arrangements to look after people fleeing persecution until such time as they could return to their own country and rebuild their lives there. What is happening in Britain as in other Western European countries today is the systematic abuse of asylum in order to get round immigration controls.</p> <p>So let me be clear about what the Conservative Party is saying, so that it cannot be cynically misrepresented by political opponents who are unwilling or unable to confront the issue.</p> <p>We believe Britain has a moral as well as a legal duty to welcome here people who are fleeing for their lives. That duty includes providing them with decent accommodation, treating them if they fall ill, ensuring that their children have a proper education, giving them the freedom to accept work and the right to family reunion in this country. I believe that if the British people have confidence that they are helping those who have been genuinely dispossessed, they will accept that duty with cheerfulness and generosity.</p> <p>For that tradition of welcoming refugees to be maintained it needs to continue to command general public support. That public support will only be forthcoming if the asylum system is clearly able to distinguish between genuine and unfounded claims, and if it is able to give practical effect to that distinction.</p> <p>The chaotic system which we have now is both ineffective and unfair. It is unfair because the people who are losing out most are genuine refugees who are forced to wait for months or years in a queue along with thousands of bogus claimants.</p> <p>It is unfair too to people who have come to settle in this country and have obeyed our immigration rules. In my experience, some of the strongest advocates of firm action against the abuse of asylum have been people from Britain's ethnic communities who have waited their turn, filled in the forms, gone through all the official hoops in order to bring a spouse or fianc\u00e9 into this country but who now see others gaining an advantage by evading the law.</p> <p>This country ought to be respected throughout the world for treating refugees and asylum seekers with great fairness. What will people think of our country if it is known throughout the world that our rules are so easy to get around and our systems so easy to abuse?</p> <p>We need a system which makes it possible to process claims speedily, so that genuine refugees can be integrated into British life and bogus claimants sent back home.</p> <p>Our aim is to formulate a credible asylum policy which safeguards the interests of the genuine refugee. There are several aspects to this.</p> <p>First, we should make much greater use of reception centres. If we look at what happens elsewhere in Europe, we can see that in Germany and France it is normal practice for people seeking asylum to be housed in designated reception centres. There is nothing inhumane or uncivilised about such an approach. When we gave refuge here to the Ugandan Asians and the Vietnamese boat-people, we housed them in reception centres while longer term arrangements were properly organised.</p> <p>By detaining in reception centres, we can be certain that people are adequately housed and supported while their claims are processed and can do that without having to resort to a complicated voucher and dispersal scheme. We can also, by ensuring that the centres are secure, make sure that people who are trying to evade immigration controls are kept in one place and are not able to disappear into the wider community. This policy will also allow people whose claims are refused to be removed quickly from this country.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Refugees_in_Britain/Story/0,2763,211680,00.html\">William Hague's speech (part two)</a><br></p>",

In the same year, the Geneva Convention provided for the first time a universal definition of the term \"refugee\" in place of the previous international practice of trying to define and help particular national groups. It is worth noting that the authors of the 1951 Convention expected that the refugee crisis was capable of solution within a relatively short space of time. Refugee status could be claimed only in respect of events which had occurred before January 1st 1951. Countries ratifying the Convention could choose (and most did) to restrict their obligations to European refugees and the High Commissioner's mandate was originally limited to three years. Sadly, events have turned out otherwise. Despite the defeat of Nazism and the collapse of Soviet tyranny, political and religious persecution are as familiar today as in the world of 1951. In 1967, the Bellagio Protocol extended the provisions of the Convention to post-1951 events and to non-Europeans. The definition of a refugee included in the 1951 Convention is now accepted by practically every country in the world and it was written into British law through our 1993 Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act. Under the Convention, a refugee is someone who has a \" well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country\". The Convention goes on to list the obligations of states towards people who have been granted refugee status. Most important is the principle that a refugee may not be returned to a country where he or she risks persecution. Other articles of the Convention deal with such matters as identity documents, employment, education and welfare. In general, European countries, including Britain, have given refugees rights similar to those enjoyed by their own countrymen and it is precisely because the rights granted to refugees are so important and because we take our obligations to genuine refugees so seriously that the current breakdown in our asylum system matters so much. For most of the post-war era, the framework established in 1951 has worked well. Someone who had climbed the Berlin Wall, someone who had fled to the West after the Hungarian Uprising in 1956 or the suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968 clearly came within the scope of the Convention. The number of people seeking asylum was relatively small and cases were usually clear-cut. All that has now changed. Over the last dozen or so years, developments in communications have transformed the opportunities available not just for western businessmen or tourists but for economic migrants worldwide. Television has become the parish notice-board of the global village. People living in poor and unstable countries can watch images of the prosperity and relative security of life in Germany or Britain or the Netherlands every night of the week on their TV screens. Cheap mass air travel makes emigration a practical possibility for ever larger numbers of people. Global communications mean that you can look beyond the next town or even the next country. Migration across continents has become easier than at any time in human history. In Europe, these profound social and technological changes have taken place at the same time that the disintegration of the Soviet Empire has brought down the physical and political barriers to emigration. People no longer need to flee Warsaw or Sofia for fear of persecution but there is nothing now to stop them seeking to emigrate for economic reasons. Throughout Western Europe, the asylum system has proved a soft target for people trying to get round the usual immigration controls. Because the 1951 Convention imposes on each government a duty to assess every application on its merits, a claim for asylum has proved an effective way to gain temporary entry to another country and then to delay or avoid removal or deportation. The official Home Office statistics show that in 1988 there were just under 4,000 applications for asylum in this country. By 1996, the last full year before Labour took office, that figure stood at 29,000. Last year, the number of claims was more than 71,000. In fact, the Home Office figures understate the actual numbers since Britain, unlike virtually every other country in Europe, counts only heads of households and not their dependants. According to the UNHCR, the total number of people - including dependants - who claimed asylum in Britain in 1999 alone was more than 93,000. Most people who claim asylum in this country do not meet the test laid down by the Convention of having a \"well-founded fear of persecution\". The consistent pattern in recent years has been for between 70 and 80 per cent of claims to be refused as unfounded. The number of claims accepted as genuine has fluctuated from as little as 3 per cent in 1992 to as many as 17 per cent in 1998. There is a further group of applicants who, while not considered refugees, are granted a time-limited exceptional leave to remain because of political instability in their homeland. Last year the number of applicants accepted was much higher than usual - 36 per cent of the total. This was due to the exceptional circumstances of the crisis in Kosovo. Very large numbers of genuine refugees were accepted into Britain between April and July 1999 but by the end of the year the pattern had reverted to normal and in January of this year outright refusals accounted for nearly 90 per cent of all asylum decisions. In one sense it is hard to blame individual asylum seekers, however flimsy their case may sometimes be. There is nothing immoral or wrong about trying to seek a better life. Fleeing poverty may not be the same as fleeing persecution, but it is difficult to blame them. From their point of view, it is worth taking a chance. But we should be under no illusions about the extent to which this has now become an organised international traffic in human beings and an organised abuse of the asylum system. People are arriving in Britain armed with expert knowledge of how to exploit our asylum laws; what to say on arrival; how to string out appeals and how to remain here if their cases are eventually turned down. When I visited Heathrow a few months ago, Immigration Officers gave me one example of how the racket works. People arrive on a plane. They disembark and then hang around at the airport for many hours before presenting themselves at the Immigration Desk, often at a different terminal from the one where they landed. By this stage they have no passport or other identity documents. They then tell the Immigration Officer on duty that they wish to claim asylum. Until quite recently, passports and other documents which had been used by the passengers to get on board the flight in the first place, were destroyed between disembarkation and claiming asylum. Now, things are more professionally organised. The asylum seekers are accompanied on their flight by a rep - someone working for the racketeers who have planned the whole thing. He disembarks with them, collects up their documents, goes to the transit area and flies out again with a set of passports all ready to be used by future customers. That is the sort of thing that is actually going on. Some of the other activities of asylum racketeers are even more elaborate. For instance in the Autumn of last year stories emerged of people being sewn into the canvas sides of Channel Tunnel freight trains by teams of gangsters. Hardly able to move during a 48 hour trip from Milan to Britain the asylum seekers eventually escape by cutting a hole in the ceiling of the train. Tragically a number have been badly burned after touching overhead cables. A spokesman for the National Criminal Intelligence Service commented : \"Those being smuggled will be sold a package including travel, fraudulent visas and information on how to deal with immigration authorities and on claiming benefits when they arrive. To pay off the cost of the trip, they will be expected to work for tiny wages at jobs arranged for them in restaurant kitchens, as waitresses or even as prostitutes.\" By such routes, the long-standing hospitality and generosity of the British people is being systematically abused. I am the first to accept that the pressure on our asylum system did not start on 1 May 1997; but nor can anyone doubt that the crisis has grown much more acute since the present Government came to office. In the last full year of Conservative Government, the number of asylum applications fell by 40 per cent while the backlog of cases awaiting a decision was cut by 12,000. Since the General Election, both totals have doubled. The backlog of people waiting to have their case determined now stands at 103,000. At one point, the Home Office's internal systems for managing asylum casework broke down completely. Even the Permanent Secretary at the Home Office has been driven to admit, in evidence given to the Public Accounts Committee, that the situation was \"pretty desperate\"- language which Sir Humphrey would have considered shockingly candid. This month it was revealed that an Algerian asylum seeker who is living in Britain with his two wives and 15 children at taxpayers` expense is in fact a convicted terrorist. The Government has manifestly failed to get to grips with the situation. When they came to office, they reversed high-profile deportation decisions. They promised to abolish the list of countries from which applications could be fast tracked and did so in their 1999 Act. They said there would be no amnesties - but have allowed 15,000 asylum seekers to stay here regardless of the merits of their asylum claims. They said that the checks on illegal employment in the 1996 Act were racist. Then they said they were not racist and that they would implement them because illegal working was a growing problem. But there has been just one prosecution in the whole of the three years of this Government. The longer the queue, the worse the administrative confusion, the greater the incentive is for racketeers to target their efforts on Britain. There is a direct link between Government incompetence in managing asylum cases and the surge in applications to stay here. Nor is it convincing for the Government to wash their hands of responsibility by saying, as they do, that the problems are all due to international developments which they are powerless to control. The exodus of refugees from Kosovo affected every country in Europe. So why was it that in 1999 Germany and the Netherlands were able to reduce the number of applicants for asylum in their countries while applications in Britain rose by more than 50 per cent? The answer is that governments in those nations now have firm and effective policies to deter unfounded applications. As the Government has failed to meet its own targets for casework it has, unsurprisingly, exceeded by far its planned expenditure on support for asylum seekers whose cases are awaiting a decision. Planned central government spending of \u00a3350 million has turned into actual spending of at least \u00a3600 million a year. The total bill since 1997 now exceeds \u00a31.5 billion. Some local authorities are under acute pressure. The London Borough of Hillingdon, which covers Heathrow Airport, has to deal with the large number of unaccompanied children who arrive by air. In Kent, the county council has struggled to cope with the increase in the numbers of asylum seekers arriving at its ports. It has also had to add almost two million pounds to Council Tax Bills after the Government failed to reimburse them fully, just one example of how Council taxes in some areas have risen sharply to help pay for the cost . \"Westminster is spending more on supporting asylum seekers than on residential and nursing placements for elderly people. Finally, the Government have decided to 'phase in' new support measures that mean many local authorities such as Hillingdon and other London boroughs will continue to bear a heavy burden. And although the new measures have been extended in full to Kent, the county council will remain responsible for many thousands of asylum seekers who have already applied. The Government's new flagship reception centre at Oakington in Cambridgshire didn`t get off to a good start. Just a few days after it opened, six asylum seekers simply walked out - and at the end of last month just 32 people were having their claims processed there. Some commentators of the left acknowledge the truth of what is happening but then go on to argue that it does not much matter. \"Britain is a rich country,\" they say. \"We can cope with these numbers and, in any case, even 71,000 new asylum seekers in 1999 is a small number when seen in the context of a population of 60 million. After all, the great majority of genuine refugees and asylum seekers in the world are to be found not in Western Europe but in the developing world\". That is the critique and one aspect of it I accept. I readily acknowledge that many poor countries in Africa and Asia are indeed struggling to look after enormous numbers of people. Conflicts in Afghanistan, in Central Asia, in Rwanda, Congo and Sierra Leone have left many thousands of people living in refugee camps in neighbouring countries. One key objective of British foreign and international development policy must be to help the international relief agencies to house and feed these people and to do what lies within our power to bring about the conditions in which they are able to return safely to their homes. But of course the purpose of the 1951 Convention and the reason for the creation of the United Nations High Commission was precisely to put in place international arrangements to look after people fleeing persecution until such time as they could return to their own country and rebuild their lives there. What is happening in Britain as in other Western European countries today is the systematic abuse of asylum in order to get round immigration controls. So let me be clear about what the Conservative Party is saying, so that it cannot be cynically misrepresented by political opponents who are unwilling or unable to confront the issue. We believe Britain has a moral as well as a legal duty to welcome here people who are fleeing for their lives. That duty includes providing them with decent accommodation, treating them if they fall ill, ensuring that their children have a proper education, giving them the freedom to accept work and the right to family reunion in this country. I believe that if the British people have confidence that they are helping those who have been genuinely dispossessed, they will accept that duty with cheerfulness and generosity. For that tradition of welcoming refugees to be maintained it needs to continue to command general public support. That public support will only be forthcoming if the asylum system is clearly able to distinguish between genuine and unfounded claims, and if it is able to give practical effect to that distinction. The chaotic system which we have now is both ineffective and unfair. It is unfair because the people who are losing out most are genuine refugees who are forced to wait for months or years in a queue along with thousands of bogus claimants. It is unfair too to people who have come to settle in this country and have obeyed our immigration rules. In my experience, some of the strongest advocates of firm action against the abuse of asylum have been people from Britain's ethnic communities who have waited their turn, filled in the forms, gone through all the official hoops in order to bring a spouse or fianc\u00e9 into this country but who now see others gaining an advantage by evading the law. This country ought to be respected throughout the world for treating refugees and asylum seekers with great fairness. What will people think of our country if it is known throughout the world that our rules are so easy to get around and our systems so easy to abuse? We need a system which makes it possible to process claims speedily, so that genuine refugees can be integrated into British life and bogus claimants sent back home. Our aim is to formulate a credible asylum policy which safeguards the interests of the genuine refugee. There are several aspects to this. First, we should make much greater use of reception centres. If we look at what happens elsewhere in Europe, we can see that in Germany and France it is normal practice for people seeking asylum to be housed in designated reception centres. There is nothing inhumane or uncivilised about such an approach. When we gave refuge here to the Ugandan Asians and the Vietnamese boat-people, we housed them in reception centres while longer term arrangements were properly organised. By detaining in reception centres, we can be certain that people are adequately housed and supported while their claims are processed and can do that without having to resort to a complicated voucher and dispersal scheme. We can also, by ensuring that the centres are secure, make sure that people who are trying to evade immigration controls are kept in one place and are not able to disappear into the wider community. This policy will also allow people whose claims are refused to be removed quickly from this country. William Hague's speech (part two)",

      "body": "<p>We Conservatives have already committed ourselves to a policy of automatically detaining asylum seekers who come from countries which we know to be safe in reception centres until their cases are decided.</p> <p>Now we have decided that it would be right to go further. So the next Conservative Government will detain all new applicants for asylum, whether port applicants or in-country applicants, in reception centres until their cases have been determined. There will be a cost in providing the centres, but I am convinced, not least by the experience of our European neighbours, that this policy will have a significant deterrent effect on those thinking of travelling here without a well founded case. In fact, we estimate that overall, our new system would reduce the cost of at least \u00a3600 million that asylum currently imposes on the taxpayer.</p> <p>Second, we shall take action to speed up asylum decisions and appeals. A report commissioned by the Home Office from the consultants Vantagepoint identified massive and unnecessary delays in the system. Let me give just two examples. Under the present arrangements, an asylum seeker who arrives in Dover or at Heathrow is interviewed at length by an Immigration Officer. He then has to refer the case to the Immigration Directorate of the Home Office, in Croydon, for the papers to be reviewed and a decision made. If these two roles of interviewer and decision taker were merged, we should be able to remove delays of between five and twenty days in around fifteen to twenty thousand asylum cases each year.</p> <p>The Vantagepoint report has been on the Home Secretary's desk for the last nine months. We ought to implement its recommendations speedily on the handling of cases, and that asylum interviews should be tape-recorded. Incredible as it may seem, the usual practice is for the interviewer to record manually what is said by the applicant. It is sixteen years since the Police and Criminal Evidence Act required police interviews to be recorded on tape. The extension of that arrangement to our asylum and immigration system is long overdue.</p> <p>Third, we shall amend the law to deter applications by people who have come from a country which is manifestly safe. It is extraordinary that we receive applications for asylum from countries which have now been formally accepted as candidates for EU membership. How can we say, on the one hand, that we accept that a country has the rule of law and good government that would qualify it to join the EU and, on the other, that we believe its citizens to be suffering systematic persecution? A future Conservative Government will draw up a list of countries where we judge the rule of law is being properly enforced and from which we will not normally accept asylum applications. We shall write into the law a presumption that a claim is unfounded if the applicant has either travelled directly from or began his journey in a safe country.</p> <p>Fourth, we shall also make clear to our European partners that we expect them to take seriously their obligations under the Dublin Convention.</p> <p>In theory, under the Convention, asylum seekers should be dealt with by the first safe country they reach, regardless of where they choose to make their application. In practice however, this policy becomes unenforceable when migrants destroy their tickets so that it is difficult to prove exactly where they came from.</p> <p>Despite our geographical position, we saw in 1999 a surge in applications here which was not matched anywhere else in the European Union. Some of this, of course, is accounted for by refugees who have come directly to Britain from non-European ports of origin. But we are still left with thousands of people who have travelled illicitly through safe and prosperous parts of western Europe before choosing to declare that they are victims of political persecution.</p> <p>Something is going badly wrong when migrants are prepared to cross the length of the continent of Europe, without once being detained, in order to lodge their asylum claims in the United Kingdom. For every genuine refugee, the priority is surely to get out of a particular country, not to get in to one.</p> <p>There will be a few legitimate exceptions, for example someone may be joining other members of his family who have reached Britain by a different route. But barring such exceptional circumstances it is surely reasonable to expect anyone fleeing persecution to apply for sanctuary as soon as he reaches a safe country. I hope that that can be done in co-operation with our European neighbours.</p> <p>The next Conservative Government will press for intergovernmental agreement among the EU states not to turn a blind eye when their countries are being used as a stopover for asylum seekers transiting to a neighbouring country. We must call on our European neighbours to take the Dublin Convention seriously.</p> <p>We must also call on the British legal profession not to take international law to absurd lengths and interpret it in a way not recognised in other countries. It is very odd that our courts have on occasion decided that perfectly civilized countries in Western Europe such as, in one recent case, France, are not 'safe' places to which refused asylum seekers can be deported. If we cannot get the current international system to work properly we may have to begin to work with other countries to change that system.</p> <p>Fifth, when people have been refused asylum they should be removed from this country without delay. What is the point of spending all this time and money on assessing whether asylum seekers have a genuine case, when nothing is done with those who do not and when, in the meantime, those with bogus claims learn how to disappear into the melting pot of society?</p> <p>In the last six months for which there are figures, there were just over 10,000 asylum decisions. Only 12 per cent were granted asylum. Another 11 per cent were allowed exceptional leave to remain. 77 per cent - 8,000 asylum seekers - had their claims turned down. Yet during the same period, fewer than 4,000 actually left the country.</p> <p>The Home Office admit that they know of at least 20,000 asylum seekers who have absconded. Some reports suggest it could be much higher.</p> <p>The next Conservative Government will set up a Removals Agency with the sole mission of making sure that people who are supposed to leave the country, do so at once. That will take a burden off the police, and simplify the process of removals. The Removals Agency will be largely composed of Immigration Service staff, assigned permanently and full-time to removals duties, with their own chain of management and sense of purpose. We need to make clear to everyone that people whose claim for asylum is not justified will, quite simply, not stay in Britain.</p> <p>Sixth, we need to make sure that there is a dose of common sense in the way the existing law is applied. We need deterrence - but measured deterrence, which is likely actually to make a difference to the way people behave.</p> <p>There are penalties for businesses who illegally employ people who have no right to be in the UK. They are not being applied properly. We would make sure that they are applied, because the prospect of finding illegal work is one of the things that attracts abusive asylum applications.</p> <p>Take the \u00a32,000 automatic fines on lorry drivers in Labour`s Immigration and Asylum Act. This automatic penalty does not distinguish between those who deliberately set out to evade the law, an offence already covered by criminal law with a penalty of up to 10 years in jail, and those who are the innocent victims of unscrupulous racketeers. We will seek to make the system fairer.</p> <p>Between eighty and ninety per cent of asylum applications are currently being refused because they have no foundation. Many of those asylum seekers should in any case never have made it to the UK in the first place, but should have been dealt with in the first safe country they came to. The package of measures I have outlined will deter bogus applications, while accelerating the progress of well-founded cases. People will know that if they claim asylum in Britain, then they will be detained and their cases will be dealt with quickly; genuine refugees will then be welcome to stay while bogus asylum seekers will be guaranteed a speedy departure from our shores.</p> <p>We will make it harder for criminals and shady businesses to exploit the asylum industry. We will protect the British taxpayer, and bring clarity to the current chaotic system. Clarity so all will know that Britain is just and fair, welcoming refugees, but not Europe\u0092s soft touch for those who want to play the system.</p> <p>In conclusion, I believe that offering asylum to genuine political refugees is the duty of democracies and the hallmark of a civilized nation.</p> <p>Since, as almost everyone accepts, no country can cope economically or socially with an unrestricted flow of migrants, the acceptance of political asylum seekers must be governed by strict rules. Since there have to be rules, there has to be enforcement of rules. And, in turn, since there has to be enforcement of rules, enforcement must be firm, fair and efficient rather than weak and arbitrary. If it is not, the system will lose public support.</p> <p>The system we have today is not firm, it is not fair, and it is not efficient. It is weak and it is arbitrary. And it is losing public support.</p> <p>Some people feel this doesn\u0092t matter. They would rather I didn\u0092t talk about it. They are wrong.</p> <p>A democracy that sets rules and doesn\u0092t enforce them loses the respect of its own citizens and the international community.</p> <p>A system of law that is arbitrary and unfair will break down.</p> <p>A tolerant, welcoming society too weak and inefficient to determine whom it wants to welcome will decline into an intolerant and unwelcoming society.</p> <p>By itself, of course, the asylum crisis is not big enough to do this. It cannot destroy something as robust as British democracy and rule of law. But it can damage the rule of law and establish deeply damaging precedents.</p> <p>In other words the crisis in the asylum system damages many things that we value most dearly about our country. It damages many of the very things that distinguish this country from the places refugees are fleeing from.</p> <p>And when there is such a crisis, the Conservative Party will speak out.</p>",

There are penalties for businesses who illegally employ people who have no right to be in the UK. They are not being applied properly. We would make sure that they are applied, because the prospect of finding illegal work is one of the things that attracts abusive asylum applications. Take the \u00a32,000 automatic fines on lorry drivers in Labour`s Immigration and Asylum Act. This automatic penalty does not distinguish between those who deliberately set out to evade the law, an offence already covered by criminal law with a penalty of up to 10 years in jail, and those who are the innocent victims of unscrupulous racketeers. We will seek to make the system fairer. Between eighty and ninety per cent of asylum applications are currently being refused because they have no foundation. Many of those asylum seekers should in any case never have made it to the UK in the first place, but should have been dealt with in the first safe country they came to. The package of measures I have outlined will deter bogus applications, while accelerating the progress of well-founded cases. People will know that if they claim asylum in Britain, then they will be detained and their cases will be dealt with quickly; genuine refugees will then be welcome to stay while bogus asylum seekers will be guaranteed a speedy departure from our shores. We will make it harder for criminals and shady businesses to exploit the asylum industry. We will protect the British taxpayer, and bring clarity to the current chaotic system. Clarity so all will know that Britain is just and fair, welcoming refugees, but not Europe\u0092s soft touch for those who want to play the system. In conclusion, I believe that offering asylum to genuine political refugees is the duty of democracies and the hallmark of a civilized nation. Since, as almost everyone accepts, no country can cope economically or socially with an unrestricted flow of migrants, the acceptance of political asylum seekers must be governed by strict rules. Since there have to be rules, there has to be enforcement of rules. And, in turn, since there has to be enforcement of rules, enforcement must be firm, fair and efficient rather than weak and arbitrary. If it is not, the system will lose public support. The system we have today is not firm, it is not fair, and it is not efficient. It is weak and it is arbitrary. And it is losing public support. Some people feel this doesn\u0092t matter. They would rather I didn\u0092t talk about it. They are wrong. A democracy that sets rules and doesn\u0092t enforce them loses the respect of its own citizens and the international community. A system of law that is arbitrary and unfair will break down. A tolerant, welcoming society too weak and inefficient to determine whom it wants to welcome will decline into an intolerant and unwelcoming society. By itself, of course, the asylum crisis is not big enough to do this. It cannot destroy something as robust as British democracy and rule of law. But it can damage the rule of law and establish deeply damaging precedents. In other words the crisis in the asylum system damages many things that we value most dearly about our country. It damages many of the very things that distinguish this country from the places refugees are fleeing from. And when there is such a crisis, the Conservative Party will speak out.",

Which must amuse Bobby Campbell, mastermind of the Blues' 1990 Zenith Data Systems Trophy triumph. Anyway, Luca has got it into his head that if C's of C can beat this bunch of Dutch strollers this evening, his team can pat themselves on the back. Not to mention the back pocket.</p> <p>The west London footballing boutique have already pocketed over \u00a35m from Uefa for simply qualifying for the quarter-finals. If they beat Barca they will get another \u00a32m - absolutely free! (although they will have to subscribe to the Uefa book club for a minimum of five years). Add to that another \u00a31m from TV rights for the semi-final and another potential \u00a35m if they win the trophy itself and you can see why Kuddly Ken Bates is getting excited.</p> <p>Which would, in turn, explain why Luca isn't contemplating defeat. \"We can win it,\" he said today. \"We have to play the same way as at Stamford Bridge. We have to show the same fearless mentality.\" To that end, Jody Morris looks likely to keep Gustavo Poyet out of the side and Luca is also tipped to pick Roberto Di Matteo over Dan Petrescu. Barcelona meanwhile will be able to pick the orifice they have their P45 shoved up if they lose. It should be an interesting game.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>PERSONAL FINANCE CAN BE FUN AFTER ALL!</strong></p> <p>Enter First Direct's <a href=\"http://www.firstdirect.com/littlefella/index.html\">Little Fella Challenge</a> and you could win a VW Beetle or Sony Wega Widescreen TV.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>NEVILLE'S BRUSH WITH EVIL</strong></p> <p>The Fiver would like to assure its readers that today's launch of SecuriFiver (the footballer's first stop for violent self-defence) and the revelation that Gary Neville has been the subject of abuse and attacks from indignant Liverpool fans are in no way connected. Unlike our new Electric Scouse-o-prod which comes with all connecting wires included for the bargain price of \u00a3299.99.</p> <p>\"I keep getting death threats,\" Neville revealed during a grilling by the Official Manchester United Magazine. \"After the recent Liverpool game my car nearly got turned over going through Salford Quays by about five Scousers,\" he went on, as if this was a unique experience.</p> <p>Neville doesn't have the best of relations with the denizens of Anfield Road, he called them names in another interview and got very excited when Ole Solskjaer dumped the Reds out of the Cup last season. But that doesn't mean he should be forced to live in fear. Although it would keep him on his toes.</p> <p>Gordon Taylor does not agree. The head of the PFA believes Neville's difficulties are in fact \"a sad reflection on society today\" and that the lesson for players \"is to be extremely careful on places where they go when they're relaxing\".

      "bodyText": "GREEN IS THE COLOUR Gianluca Vialli reckons that tonight's Big Cup match-up with Barcelona is \"the most important match in [Chelsea's of] Chelsea's history\". Which must amuse Bobby Campbell, mastermind of the Blues' 1990 Zenith Data Systems Trophy triumph. Anyway, Luca has got it into his head that if C's of C can beat this bunch of Dutch strollers this evening, his team can pat themselves on the back. Not to mention the back pocket. The west London footballing boutique have already pocketed over \u00a35m from Uefa for simply qualifying for the quarter-finals. If they beat Barca they will get another \u00a32m - absolutely free! (although they will have to subscribe to the Uefa book club for a minimum of five years). Add to that another \u00a31m from TV rights for the semi-final and another potential \u00a35m if they win the trophy itself and you can see why Kuddly Ken Bates is getting excited. Which would, in turn, explain why Luca isn't contemplating defeat. \"We can win it,\" he said today. \"We have to play the same way as at Stamford Bridge. We have to show the same fearless mentality.\" To that end, Jody Morris looks likely to keep Gustavo Poyet out of the side and Luca is also tipped to pick Roberto Di Matteo over Dan Petrescu. Barcelona meanwhile will be able to pick the orifice they have their P45 shoved up if they lose. It should be an interesting game. * * * * * * * * * * * * * PERSONAL FINANCE CAN BE FUN AFTER ALL! Enter First Direct's Little Fella Challenge and you could win a VW Beetle or Sony Wega Widescreen TV. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEVILLE'S BRUSH WITH EVIL The Fiver would like to assure its readers that today's launch of SecuriFiver (the footballer's first stop for violent self-defence) and the revelation that Gary Neville has been the subject of abuse and attacks from indignant Liverpool fans are in no way connected. Unlike our new Electric Scouse-o-prod which comes with all connecting wires included for the bargain price of \u00a3299.99. \"I keep getting death threats,\" Neville revealed during a grilling by the Official Manchester United Magazine. \"After the recent Liverpool game my car nearly got turned over going through Salford Quays by about five Scousers,\" he went on, as if this was a unique experience. Neville doesn't have the best of relations with the denizens of Anfield Road, he called them names in another interview and got very excited when Ole Solskjaer dumped the Reds out of the Cup last season. But that doesn't mean he should be forced to live in fear. Although it would keep him on his toes. Gordon Taylor does not agree. The head of the PFA believes Neville's difficulties are in fact \"a sad reflection on society today\" and that the lesson for players \"is to be extremely careful on places where they go when they're relaxing\". Brendon Batson, Taylor's deputy, concurs. \"People have to take care of their own personal safety,\" he said as the Fiver unveiled its unique two-headed mace (\u00a3499.99). \"There is a lunatic fringe out there.\" Yeah, and it's flopping onto Gary Neville's forehead as we speak. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We stand by the fact that we regrew John Hartson's hair using Minoxidil, the only approved drug in Britain for hair regrowth, combined with our laser therapy treatment.\" Carl Howell, managing director of the Advanced Hair Studio, finally speaks out on the issue that's got them all talking. * * * * * * * * * * * * * OUT ON A LINDA Hello there dear readers, this is Lynda Lee Fiver with another reactionary rant against those greasy-haired, pot-smoking louts that pass for professional footballers these days.

I lack the hand-eye coordination for ball sports, yoga sends me to sleep, and aerobics always seemed more of an insane leotard fashion contest than a means of keeping fit. </p> <p>Needless to say, I would have choked on my cocktail if a fortune teller had told me I was going to become a slave to an American fitness guru called Billy Blanks and his creation, taebo. But I did. </p> <p>My eyes aren't glazed over, and I haven't been brainwashed. I can't even be completely sure that making taebo compulsory in schools would bring about world peace. But I do think this man is some kind of genius. So does Jennifer Aniston. And if anything could make my body look even vaguely like hers, it must be verging on the miraculous. </p> <p>Blanks, America's dominant martial artist in the 80s, was dyslexic and taunted because of a hip joint anomaly as a child. He overcame this to become a black belt in six different martial arts, won a raft of international gold medals and appeared in movies and on TV, most notably the kickboxing episode of Ally McBeal. </p> <p>The taebo idea came to him 20 years ago while he was going through his moves to dance music - and noticed how quickly he became breathless. He started teaching it 12 years ago in California, and now trains a whole host of celebrity converts including Pamela Anderson, Brandy, Brooke Shields - and Jennifer Aniston. </p> <p>In the States, the man is huge. He has his own pay-per-view television channel, Taebo TV, and his video, launched two years ago, has sold 30m copies. In the street he needs bodyguards to protect him from mobs of adoring fans - women who say he's made them feel empowered, and men who say he's made them feel manly. Both sexes agree he has revolutionised their bodies.</p> <p>My own obsession began a year ago while I was living in the Philippine capital, Manila, where it's easier than ever to avoid exercise, thanks to the hideous traffic, heat, almost total lack of parks, and choking pollution. A Spanish friend had heard about taebo classes starting at a local dance studio, and was keen to try it. She didn't want to be the only huge, red-faced, sweating white devil in a gym full of well-toned, giggling Filipinos, so I went along too. </p> <p>The teacher, Vanessa, was a petite, charming woman with the face of a cute little chipmunk. She also had the kind of back muscles to shame a stevedore, like a pair of sleeping pythons on each side of her spine. </p> <p>She had trained in New York to teach a kind of taebo called power boxing, which, she explained, was basically a mixture of tae-kwon-do and kickboxing moves set to aerobic speed dance music, along with a bit of circuit training and floor work incorporating the principles of Pilates. \"You won't recognise your body within a month,\" she said. I smirked. Little did she know that after this class I would be back to my life of sofas and cocktails. </p> <p>First off was the warm-up, and then some demonstrations and advice on punching and kicking. \"You may find you get quite carried away, but the most important thing to remember is never to lock or snap your elbows or knees,\" Vanessa warned. </p> <p>The class progressed through punches in single, double and half time, uppercuts, hooks, elbow swings, speed bag punches, strong punches, shuffling, side kicks and front kicks. There were push-ups, sit-ups, and all manner of running on the spot and arm movements that made me feel my limbs were exploding with lactic acid. </p> <p>Cardiovascular exercise had surely never been so painful, but Vanessa would brook no wilting, and darted around, yelling: \"Hit the guy in the chin!\" and: \"Come on, draw blood!\" </p> <p>It was an extraordinary experience. At first we were all a bit self-conscious, but within no time I could see the utter absorption on everyone's faces reflected in the huge gym mirror. Some people looked genuinely, sneeringly, Taxi Driver unhinged as they beat their imaginary opponents to a pulp. Others were grunting with determination. There was an awful lot of laughing and pointing, too, though - when we could catch our breath, of course. </p> <p>\"My God,\" my friend said afterwards. \"I never knew how much frustration and aggression I must have bottled up all the time. I've only just realised that I normally have a constant, slight tightness in my chest - and the only reason I've noticed is because now it's gone.\" I was physically shattered, but had truly never experienced such an adrenalin or endorphin rush from exercise. </p> <p>Like mad pyramid scheme salesmen, we begged all our friends to come along - as everyone else had clearly done, too. By the next class, the gym was heaving. I started going twice or even three times a week. </p> <p>Within a fortnight, real muscle definition started to appear from the depths of the quivering lard covering my upper arms and stomach. Aside from the stamina and control I developed, being able to leap in the air and kick a spot millimetres from someone's nose turned out to be a very successful party trick. One woman told me that taebo gave her the kind of high she had previously only got from shoplifting or designer drugs. </p> <p>My boyfriend was less than impressed with me practising my kicks on him, but even he had to admit the effects were amazing. I was calmer, more confident, and yet had enough energy to go out dancing till dawn three nights a week. And thanks to the support from those strengthened stomach muscles, the low-level back pain I'd suffered for a few years disappeared completely. </p> <p>I was bereft when I left the Philippines - and a large part of this was due to leaving taebo. But the mania is starting to take off here, too. When launched in Britain six months ago, Billy Blanks's video went straight to number one and has stayed there.

      "body": "<p><strong> Week 20 </strong></p> <p>I seem to have an early memory of seeing an ultrasound test on Playschool. Through the square window: a mummy exposing her globe of a belly with the navel inside out like the North Pole and a baby glowing on a screen ... </p> <p>It can't be a real memory because it's in colour (70s beige and green) and we had a black and white telly till I was eight. I think that picture, with the doctor swishing the magic wand, the woman smiling, is a bit of Jungian flotsam - a mark of how much the ultrasound, rather than, say, the christening, has entered our collective unconscious as an icon of motherhood. Certainly it is the event most people ask after, though perhaps they want to get over as quickly as possible the moment when you press yet another blurred ultrasound photo into their palm. </p> <p>It all makes for an excited atmosphere in the waiting room which, in my town, is indeed 70s green and beige. It's a shared moment: women bring their partners, their children or, if they are teenagers, their mothers. Lots seem to be. I think, as I think in all NHS waiting rooms, about how old, tall, well-nourished and rich I am, and how glad that I don't have acne any more. </p> <p>No one chats much because you're advised to turn up with a full bladder to raise the uterus and, this being the NHS, there's a queue. We focus on old Hello! magazines with exquisite concentration and, if we still can, we cross our legs. </p> <p>The image on the ultrasound screen doesn't look like a baby. It looks like outer space, with the nurse's indicator moving randomly over galaxies, black holes, the Milky Way, settling on a constellation she declares to be a brain. Then I see it, too, clear as Orion in the sky: the outline of a head, a nose, a moving arm, and the whole thing is as teary and epiphanic as generally advertised. Baby waves: we giggle. It briefly occurs to me that the horror of finding something wrong or something missing in this much-hyped moment must be extreme. </p> <p>They did give me a little black and white photo to take away. I'm very fond of it: Baby in profile to the waist (they don't tell you gender in my hospital), lying on his/her back, hands raised in benediction, very peaceful and ancient-looking. They certified that he/she was an \"active singleton\", which pleases me, since most of my friends are active singletons, too. They also gave me - and this I was unprepared for - a set of her measurements, together with a graph so I can chart them against the national average. My baby's girth, I learn, is in the 97th percentile of largeness, but his legs only in the 55th. She is the shape of a power lifter, in other words, of a sumo wrestler, of Ganesh the Elephant God. </p> <p>Already, I am worried. I had wanted, above all things, for my baby to inherit from his father the long, fleet legs that allowed him to sprint past playground tormentors and grow up with an intact body image. Already, I am talking myself into maternal self-blame: that long abdomen and those short limbs are mine, and they're hopeless in trousers and stumpy round the track. Baby will never be able to wear hipsters and PE teachers will torture him, and it will all be my genetic fault. I expect the nurse spent ages on the brain because the self-doubt cortex was abnormally large. </p> <p>And this is only Baby's first measuring. She will be given national scores at birth, at four, at 11, at 16. Never, in fact, have mothers had access to such a wide spectrum of scores: not just physical but mental, psychological, genetic. I'll know whether or not Baby is smiling, burping, crawling, drawing, relating to his peers, playing games or recognising farmyard noises at the right time. </p> <p>It's not that I'll blame him, either. Instead, I'll debate endlessly whether it is my genes that are causing it, or something in the too stimulating/not stimulating environment I provide, or even the glass of champagne I drank at the millennium, since the latest survey says that embryos whose mothers drink don't respond so well to whistles in the womb. </p> <p>I wish I knew none of these things. Or knew them and didn't care. I wish I could accept this first child as if he were the last of seven and love him and nourish him and be equably, vaguely surprised when he turned out to have long legs or short ones, to enjoy chemistry or be a champion sprinter. I wish I could keep looking at him like a constellation of immeasurable stars and be awed and moved each time they took on a human, recognisable form.</p>",

I think that picture, with the doctor swishing the magic wand, the woman smiling, is a bit of Jungian flotsam - a mark of how much the ultrasound, rather than, say, the christening, has entered our collective unconscious as an icon of motherhood. Certainly it is the event most people ask after, though perhaps they want to get over as quickly as possible the moment when you press yet another blurred ultrasound photo into their palm. It all makes for an excited atmosphere in the waiting room which, in my town, is indeed 70s green and beige. It's a shared moment: women bring their partners, their children or, if they are teenagers, their mothers. Lots seem to be. I think, as I think in all NHS waiting rooms, about how old, tall, well-nourished and rich I am, and how glad that I don't have acne any more. No one chats much because you're advised to turn up with a full bladder to raise the uterus and, this being the NHS, there's a queue. We focus on old Hello! magazines with exquisite concentration and, if we still can, we cross our legs. The image on the ultrasound screen doesn't look like a baby. It looks like outer space, with the nurse's indicator moving randomly over galaxies, black holes, the Milky Way, settling on a constellation she declares to be a brain. Then I see it, too, clear as Orion in the sky: the outline of a head, a nose, a moving arm, and the whole thing is as teary and epiphanic as generally advertised. Baby waves: we giggle. It briefly occurs to me that the horror of finding something wrong or something missing in this much-hyped moment must be extreme. They did give me a little black and white photo to take away. I'm very fond of it: Baby in profile to the waist (they don't tell you gender in my hospital), lying on his/her back, hands raised in benediction, very peaceful and ancient-looking. They certified that he/she was an \"active singleton\", which pleases me, since most of my friends are active singletons, too. They also gave me - and this I was unprepared for - a set of her measurements, together with a graph so I can chart them against the national average. My baby's girth, I learn, is in the 97th percentile of largeness, but his legs only in the 55th. She is the shape of a power lifter, in other words, of a sumo wrestler, of Ganesh the Elephant God. Already, I am worried. I had wanted, above all things, for my baby to inherit from his father the long, fleet legs that allowed him to sprint past playground tormentors and grow up with an intact body image. Already, I am talking myself into maternal self-blame: that long abdomen and those short limbs are mine, and they're hopeless in trousers and stumpy round the track. Baby will never be able to wear hipsters and PE teachers will torture him, and it will all be my genetic fault. I expect the nurse spent ages on the brain because the self-doubt cortex was abnormally large. And this is only Baby's first measuring. She will be given national scores at birth, at four, at 11, at 16. Never, in fact, have mothers had access to such a wide spectrum of scores: not just physical but mental, psychological, genetic. I'll know whether or not Baby is smiling, burping, crawling, drawing, relating to his peers, playing games or recognising farmyard noises at the right time. It's not that I'll blame him, either. Instead, I'll debate endlessly whether it is my genes that are causing it, or something in the too stimulating/not stimulating environment I provide, or even the glass of champagne I drank at the millennium, since the latest survey says that embryos whose mothers drink don't respond so well to whistles in the womb. I wish I knew none of these things. Or knew them and didn't care. I wish I could accept this first child as if he were the last of seven and love him and nourish him and be equably, vaguely surprised when he turned out to have long legs or short ones, to enjoy chemistry or be a champion sprinter. I wish I could keep looking at him like a constellation of immeasurable stars and be awed and moved each time they took on a human, recognisable form.",

      "body": "<p>Before the car crash I was extremely motivated and focused. My future was pretty much mapped out as a high achiever in the world of sport. I was 21, about to enter my second year studying for a degree in physical education and English at university. </p> <p>But nothing ever prepares you for the unexpected in life. While touring France in a car in August 1994 the driver dozed off at the wheel at 70mph. I was asleep when we hit a tree head on. Wearing a safety belt undoubtedly saved my life, but my head took the full brunt of the force. Though my lower body ended up in the engine block, my forehead smashed into the dashboard, breaking it in half. My skull shattered into 50 parts. I don't remember anything of the crash, though I was lucid immediately after impact. </p> <p>At first, neurosurgeons at Marseilles hospital signed me off as another road statistic - the front lobe of my brain was virtually irreparable and in intensive care I was too weak for surgery. But 72 hours later, doctors decided I was stable enough for surgeons to piece back together the bits of skull bone like a jigsaw puzzle. For the next five weeks, I suffered from post traumatic amnesia - even today, the actual crash is a blank. </p> <p>Then a month later at Brooks Hospital, south London, I underwent a second critical operation. Doctors had to remove the pieces of skull to make way for continuing brain swelling and fix a membrane tear because fluid began leaking through my nose. Those 11 weeks in hospital were extremely hazy, as were the subsequent months convalescing at home. </p> <p>There was no outside provision for help, so my parents were left to care for me around the clock. I was sleeping 18 hours a day and felt like a zombie. I'd lost just under three stone in weight and resembled a prisoner of war. I was extremely irritable and aggressive. </p> <p>With up to one million people in the UK a year attending hospital with a head injury, there is a common misconception that head injury victims suffer brain damage and lose IQ points. Yet IQ often remains unaffected and in fact the damage is often largely psychological. I suffered from frighteningly quick and frequent mood swings. I'd turn vile and vitriolic in an instant - swearing, shouting, criticising, almost in tears because I couldn't cope with the intensity of so many raw emotions. </p> <p>Yet I had always been so patient, calm and level-headed. Now I felt completely at the mercy of my emotions. It was so extreme: I'd feel hysterically happy or bitterly upset. I'd laugh or cry in an instant. I was behaving totally out of character. Bored and frustrated, I craved outside stimulation and in September 1985 I decided to go back to college convinced I could pick up from pre-crash days - convinced nothing had changed. </p> <p>But I was psychologically a different person, with no awareness of my own situation, the new limitations and potential difficulties. I didn't even know I had a short-term memory problem until a few weeks into my course when it became obvious I couldn't cope. The crash had somehow damaged my body clock, so I was still going to bed at 3am and not waking until midday. I missed all the morning lectures and felt very de-motivated, unwilling to catch up. It was a downward spiral. I couldn't concentrate or contribute during the six hourly daily lectures and, because of the head injuries, was excluded from playing many sports - football, rugby, squash, diving, underwater swimming, gymnastics. </p> <p>For the first time in my academic life I was underachieving so badly I was forced to give up the course by spring. I hadn't experienced failing before and, out of character, began spending money I didn't have impulsively and recklessly. I had no job, no social group, no career, and no prospects. It was obvious I needed rehabilitation, yet there was nothing available locally on the NHS. Instead, in August 1986, I started a 13-month private residence rehab programme, which cost \u00a340,000, paid for by insurance damages. I was lucky. A psychologist had assessed and negotiated the compensation. Failing that, there was no other available or nearby option to help aid my recovery. </p> <p>By now I was totally unmotivated, lacked confidence and any self-discipline. The treatment worked on that bit by bit - forcing me to get up early, wash and brush my teeth or play computer games when the programme is set to fail, so the player has to constantly deal and learn with their limitations. Rehab for head injuries is critical sooner rather than later. Afterwards, I immediately worked as an assistant newsagent rising at 4.30am six days a week for five months, then as a record shop sales assistant, interacting with new confidence with customers. Next I was a youth worker helping all the local youth organisations. </p> <p>Meanwhile, my father won his tireless campaign to the local health council and social services to recognise head injuries as a separate \"hidden\" disability and set up a local branch of Headway in 1992. I've learnt to write lists obsessively and prioritise - the only way I can remember everything. Psychologically, my behaviour is less acute, though irritability, low tolerance and surface emotions are still evident. </p> <p>For personal guidance, I worked out a structure for my life and lowered my expectations, then gradually came to terms with my limitations by identifying them and working within them. Now I lead a full, rewarding and productive life because I have set different goals to achieve. Up to 15 times a day, I am reminded of my brain injury - albeit for a split second. You can never escape or forget it. Yet with the uninitiated in society, the lack of awareness surrounding head injuries tends to invite a negative attitude through ignorance or insensitivity.

      "body": "<p><strong> Scared to start a family </strong></p> <p><strong>Q</strong> After recent work-related stress, my husband developed a rash on the shaft of his penis, along with neuralgia and tingling in the penis and soreness in the scrotum. One doctor said it was thrush but a second said the symptoms pointed to genital herpes. I have had cold sores round my mouth but we have been careful to avoid oral sex when I had the sores. We had hoped to start a family this year but are now afraid to. Please advise us what to do next. </p> <p><strong> A</strong> It may have been genital herpes, which causes tiny blisters, often heralded by burning of the skin, swollen glands and feeling unwell. Persistent pain after they have healed is unusual and your husband may like to try lignocaine gel. If it was herpes, it may have been your husband's first attack, or a recurrence triggered by stress. He may have caught herpes during oral sex even if you didn't have a cold sore at the time because the virus can persist even if no blisters are apparent. </p> <p>If you have never had genital herpes, you can have a blood test to check that you have antibodies to both types of the virus. It can be dangerous for a baby to be delivered vaginally if you are having a first attack of herpes, but if you have antibodies in your bloodstream already, it means you won't have a first attack when you give birth. You need to ask your GP to refer you to a specialist genito-urinary or sexually transmitted diseases clinic. After a few basic tests, you should be reassured and ready to try for that pregnancy. </p> <p>For more info, call the Herpes Virus Association on 020-7609 9061. </p> <p><strong> I want my immunity back </strong></p> <p> <strong> Q </strong>I have myeloma, cancer of the blood cells, which has been successfully treated with chemotherapy and an autologous stem cell transplant from my own bone marrow. My blood counts have largely recovered but I am rarely without a heavy respiratory infection. Oral antibiotics are a help but I feel my immune system has been devastated and wonder what I can do to help it recover. </p> <p><strong>A</strong> Professor Grant Prentice, haematologist at the Royal Free Hospital, says that myeloma affects your immune system because it attacks plasma cells in the bone marrow. Myeloma causes bone pain, anaemia and kidney damage. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and autologous marrow transplants aim to halt the progress of the disease. Allogenic transplants from a donor can offer a cure. After a transplant such as yours, immunity may be further impaired for up to a year. However, after that, if your disease is in remission, you should bounce back. Meanwhile, don't smoke, eat a balanced diet and exercise. Professor Prentice does not advise extra supplements or a special diet. If you develop a serious viral illness like shingles, you may be knocked for six so seek urgent expert help. </p> <p><strong> Three jabs or one?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Q</strong> We have a daughter who has just turned one. With that date came an invitation for the MMR jab. We have heard that the vaccines are available in their constituent parts and would be happier to pursue this option. Could you tell me whether these vaccines are available individually? </p> <p> <strong>A </strong> I don't think giving three separate jabs instead of one is kind to your child, or scientifically valid. The proposed link between autism and MMR hasn't been supported by other studies. Worries about measles and Crohn's disease have been largely disproved. Moreover, there is no evidence to suggest that giving the three components (measles, mumps, rubella) separately makes them safer. You can get the rubella jab in this country but the mumps jab on its own is less effective than the strain in MMR, and the measles is not available at all. I think the jabs should be offered separately to those that want it; but I would choose the single MMR.</p>",

Persistent pain after they have healed is unusual and your husband may like to try lignocaine gel. If it was herpes, it may have been your husband's first attack, or a recurrence triggered by stress. He may have caught herpes during oral sex even if you didn't have a cold sore at the time because the virus can persist even if no blisters are apparent. If you have never had genital herpes, you can have a blood test to check that you have antibodies to both types of the virus. It can be dangerous for a baby to be delivered vaginally if you are having a first attack of herpes, but if you have antibodies in your bloodstream already, it means you won't have a first attack when you give birth. You need to ask your GP to refer you to a specialist genito-urinary or sexually transmitted diseases clinic. After a few basic tests, you should be reassured and ready to try for that pregnancy. For more info, call the Herpes Virus Association on 020-7609 9061. I want my immunity back Q I have myeloma, cancer of the blood cells, which has been successfully treated with chemotherapy and an autologous stem cell transplant from my own bone marrow. My blood counts have largely recovered but I am rarely without a heavy respiratory infection. Oral antibiotics are a help but I feel my immune system has been devastated and wonder what I can do to help it recover. A Professor Grant Prentice, haematologist at the Royal Free Hospital, says that myeloma affects your immune system because it attacks plasma cells in the bone marrow. Myeloma causes bone pain, anaemia and kidney damage. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and autologous marrow transplants aim to halt the progress of the disease. Allogenic transplants from a donor can offer a cure. After a transplant such as yours, immunity may be further impaired for up to a year. However, after that, if your disease is in remission, you should bounce back. Meanwhile, don't smoke, eat a balanced diet and exercise. Professor Prentice does not advise extra supplements or a special diet. If you develop a serious viral illness like shingles, you may be knocked for six so seek urgent expert help. Three jabs or one? Q We have a daughter who has just turned one. With that date came an invitation for the MMR jab. We have heard that the vaccines are available in their constituent parts and would be happier to pursue this option. Could you tell me whether these vaccines are available individually? A I don't think giving three separate jabs instead of one is kind to your child, or scientifically valid. The proposed link between autism and MMR hasn't been supported by other studies. Worries about measles and Crohn's disease have been largely disproved. Moreover, there is no evidence to suggest that giving the three components (measles, mumps, rubella) separately makes them safer. You can get the rubella jab in this country but the mumps jab on its own is less effective than the strain in MMR, and the measles is not available at all. I think the jabs should be offered separately to those that want it; but I would choose the single MMR.",

A series of earnings reports due from leading American technology companies, such as Intel and IBM, is expected to dominate US trading.</p> <p>By mid-morning, the pan-European Eurotop index of 300 shares was up 2.89 points, or 0.19%, at 1,539.09, while the narrower Euro Stoxx index of 50 blue chip euro zone shares was up 30.43 points, or 0.61%, at 5,010.09.</p> <p>\"People were never going to chase this market up and then have it come back in their face,\" said the London head of sales at a leading European brokerage.</p> <p>Among leading European markets, London's FTSE 100 was up 0.01%, Frankfurt's Dax was down 0.4%, and Paris's CAC was down 0.3%. European shares were led by technology, media and telecommunications stocks, with the DJStoxx technology index up 2.6%, media 2.3% and telecommunications 1.25%. All three had earlier been more than 3% higher.</p> <p>Britain's Marconi was the biggest gainer, up 6.1%, followed by Finnish telecommunications firm Nokia, up 5.5%, and Dutch firm Philips Electronics NV, which gained 5%.

      "bodyText": "European markets slipped back in nervous trading today after an early bounce amid concerns that the global rally sparked by the US on Monday would fizzle out. The battered technology, media and telecommunications sectors held on to early gains, but many \"old economy\" shares in traditional manufacturing and finance failed to take a lead from their peers' recovery in the US yesterday. Earlier, Asia's shaky stock markets rebounded, with only Japan's Nikkei ending lower, following big gains in the Dow Jones and Nasdaq indices in the US on Monday. But the Dow Jones industrial average was expected to open (2.30pm our time) as much as 100 points down and the technology-heavy Nasdaq about the same, dashing hopes of a sustained rally. A series of earnings reports due from leading American technology companies, such as Intel and IBM, is expected to dominate US trading. By mid-morning, the pan-European Eurotop index of 300 shares was up 2.89 points, or 0.19%, at 1,539.09, while the narrower Euro Stoxx index of 50 blue chip euro zone shares was up 30.43 points, or 0.61%, at 5,010.09. \"People were never going to chase this market up and then have it come back in their face,\" said the London head of sales at a leading European brokerage. Among leading European markets, London's FTSE 100 was up 0.01%, Frankfurt's Dax was down 0.4%, and Paris's CAC was down 0.3%. European shares were led by technology, media and telecommunications stocks, with the DJStoxx technology index up 2.6%, media 2.3% and telecommunications 1.25%. All three had earlier been more than 3% higher. Britain's Marconi was the biggest gainer, up 6.1%, followed by Finnish telecommunications firm Nokia, up 5.5%, and Dutch firm Philips Electronics NV, which gained 5%. Earlier, Asian markets had recovered most of Monday's losses following a sharp recovery in US shares. Japan's Nikkei 225 index closed at 18,969.52, down 39.12 points or 0.21% after rising as much as 1.7% early on. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index rose 3.5% to 15,278.32, boosted by demand for China Telecom (Hong Kong). Korea's KOSPI index - Asia's biggest casualty in Monday's sell-off - surged 5%, while Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 bounced back 2.5%. US stock futures fell in early trading amid concern that yesterday's rally may not represent the start of a sustained rebound.

A police armed response unit, including a hostage negotiator and two ambulances, rushed to Rosebery Avenue in Clerkenwell, east London, at 10.23am fearing staff might be trapped inside. However, Scotland Yard confirmed later that the floor of the building had been successfully evacuated before the siege began as the refugee demanded to be allowed to stay in the UK. Earlier, the man had been granted an adjournment in his appeal hearing to submit medical reports after the Home Office rejected his asylum application. He is thought to have a history of mental illness A squad of 20 riot police with shields and batons, backed by armed officers, entered the office block. The incident ended peacefully an hour later when the man, believed to be a Kurd in his early 30s, gave himself up after being allowed to speak to his pregnant wife. He emerged with a blanket over his head and was driven off to hospital in a police van to be treated for a cut to a hand. Judge Hubert Dunn QC, the chief immigration adjudicator who was in the building at the time, said: \"There was a Turkish case applying for refugee status. We have been informed by his advisers that he was on medication and did not take it this morning. \"His application for an adjournment was granted by the adjudicator and outside the court he produced a knife and asked to be granted what he called 'immigration status', meaning refugee status, and it was a very threatening and alarming situation. \"The man had a sharp knife pointed at his own throat for half an hour.\" Taylor House has 21 courts and is also responsible for centres in west London, Birmingham, Leeds., Manchester, Cardiff, Havant, Glasgow and Belfast. Appeals are decided within four months and the total nationally will top 60,000 this year - more than 25% up on the 48,000 last year. Judge Dunn denied the increasingly bitter political debate over asylum seekers had heightened tensions in the appeals system. \"We stay totally out of the politics and therefore I would not say there has been an increase in tension,\" he said.",

Teams of elite lawyers will have spent weeks studying and arguing over crates of laboratory notes, letters and emails, prised from the reluctant hands of some of America's leading medical researchers. The case is a landmark battle between the public and the private sector - between a rapidly growing Dublin-based pharmaceutical firm, Elan, and an influential non-profit medical research organisation, the Mayo Foundation. At stake in this epic struggle: who owns a mouse.</p> <p>Few people have heard of mouse TG2576. But the mouse, and its descendants, are mighty mice. Pound for pound, they are probably the most expensive animals in the world: a breeding trio of males is said to be worth more than half a million pounds. TG2576, also known as the Hsiao Mouse after its creator Karen Hsiao-Ashe, is precious because it is demented. It is born to contract Alzheimer's disease. Dr Hsiao-Ashe, of the University of Minnesota, designed it that way.</p> <p>Known as a \"transgenic mouse\", its genes, and thus the genes of its offspring, are artificially altered so that its cells produce a mutant human protein which has been implicated in Alzheimer's. When the mice are 10 months old, they begin, reliably, to get senile. They forget things they were just taught. A mouse with Alzheimer's disease is a gateway to beating the illness. That makes it valuable to the millions of Alzheimer's sufferers around the world (500,000 in the UK, 4m in the US), to the researchers trying to find a cure, and to the shareholders of the firms trying to get cures to market.</p> <p>The Minnesota-based Mayo Foundation - which provides Hsiao mice at cost to academic researchers around the world, and sells them to commercial companies - refused to say how much the private sector was prepared to pay for the animals. But Mayo neuroscientist Steven Younkin, one of Hsaio's collaborators, says: \"Let's take a figure of, say, $2m. Do you think any firm working seriously on a treatment with a potential annual market of $150bn is going to stop for $2m? It's a drop in the bucket.\"</p> <p>One of those firms is Elan. Its share price has shot up since it began trials of a vaccine which may prevent or treat Alzheimer's. The vaccine was developed with the help of another, secret strain of Alzheimer's mouse which Elan created. Unlike the Hsiao mouse, the Elan mouse is not universally available, and not for sale. But keeping its mouse under lock and key is not enough for Elan: it wants to prevent distribution of the Hsiao mouse as well, accusing Mayo of infringing Elan's patents on a third strain of mouse. Hence the court battle.</p> <p>Elan refuses to say what its ultimate goal is in suing Mayo. \"It is Elan's policy to enforce its intellectual property rights,\" says company spokesman Max Gershenoff. \"Beyond that we cannot comment on any on-going litigation.\" Mayo's Dr Younkin was more forthcoming. Like other researchers across the US, he has been ordered to make research notes and data available for the case. (One indignant colleague told the journal Nature that he would rather go to prison than surrender his notes.)</p> <p>\"I think [Elan's] strategy is, 'Let's make sure we make all the money we possibly can, and if it slows down research, that's too bad. We've got our shareholders to worry about,'\" says Dr Younkin. \"Karen decided on day one that she was giving her mouse to any academic researcher who asked for it.\"</p> <p>Mice have never been so big. The world of medical research, and much of the rest of the world besides, is agog at the wondrous possibilities for miracle cures and extended lifespans offered by the great project to decipher the 3bn letter genetic code which makes humans humans - the human genome project. On the outside, it is a work of robotics and computers, of dizzyingly powerful microscopes and cell manipulation machinery. On the inside, it's about mice. The machines churn out the genes: only the mice, whose genetic make-up is humblingly similar to our own, can tell us what the genes do.</p> <p>\"At conferences people are swapping their mice around, arranging marriages between mice,\" says Dr Denis Alexander, who has helped design mice to investigate the human immune system at the Babraham Institute outside Cambridge. \"You can't even measure how much slower research would be if it wasn't for the transgenic mice. The genome project would be throwing out all these genes and you wouldn't be able to do experiments. To do it the traditional way, you'd be talking about hundreds of years of work. If we didn't have these mice we'd still be in the immunological dark ages.\"</p> <p>The mice are not as nature made them, but mice as men and women fabricated them. In the early days of patent mice, there were mutant mice: researchers would bombard hordes of mice with radiation or put special chemicals in their drinking water, pick out chance mutations which seemed interesting, and breed the mutants up. This was how the Obese Mouse, the Diabetic Mouse and the Muscular Dystrophy Mouse were produced. Others, like the Nude Mouse, were made by simple inbreeding. Then, from the 1980s onwards, came transgenic mice - mice with genes added, usually human genes - and knockout mice, which have genes taken away to see what will happen.</p> <p>The total number of man-made mice strains is impossible to calculate, because many firms have made mice in secret. But one guess is 2-3,000, with new mice being announced every week, all mimicking some human flaw. There are Huntington's disease mice and cystic fibrosis mice, mice that get cancer, mice with bad hearts, diabetic mice and asthmatic mice.</p> <p>Not all the mice are doomed to suffer from birth. In 1997, US scientists produced a \"Schwarzenegger\" knockout mouse with two to three times normal muscle mass. Another supermouse was kitted out with a human gene which made it resistant to heart disease. Last year, Italian scientists announced a knockout mouse which lived up to a third longer than conventional mice; in the US, the Mahogany Mouse ate and ate and stayed thin.</p> <p>Other knockout mice - neurotic mice, mice susceptible to cocaine addiction - have led researchers to make contested claims about the relationship between mental states and genes. Faith in the mouse as model for human frailties is extraordinarily strong among scientists. If there were to be a common epitaph on the graves of biotech companies whose bold new treatments for people failed, it would be: \"It worked on mice.\" Yet there is a powerful feeling in some research camps, like the Alzheimer's camp, that the long-awaited pay-off for sick humans is on the horizon, and the mice are to be thanked.</p> <p>\"The mice they've made are the most important advances in disease research to have been made in recent years,\" says Dr Simon Lovestone, a British Alzheimer's researcher. \"It's no exaggeration to say drugs will be made that will actually treat this disease within five or 10 years.\"</p> <p>Figures from the home office, which keeps scrupulous records on every mouse which passes through British labs, tell their own story. Since 1977, when 3.3m scientific \"procedures\" on mice were carried out, the number has more than halved to 1.6m. But in the 90s, the number of procedures on transgenic and knockout mice soared, from only 48,000 in 1990 to nearly half a million in 1998. In the rush for gene gold and prizes, the increase is expected to continue. Scientists can get mouse embryos or full-grown mice by post; they can even order them over the internet.</p> <p>\"You can just go through the web, make a request for a particular mouse strain and we will send it off to you,\" says Professor Steve Brown, of the Medical Research Council's big mouse house at Harwell. Prof Brown's speciality is deaf mice.</p> <p>Researchers love tailor-made mice for many reasons. Because their natural lifespans are short, the effects of their altered genes show up early. They breed quickly. They don't take up much space. And scientists don't take as much flak from animal rights campaigners and anti-vivisectionists for using them. They're more like people than flies or worms are, but not as genetically close to us as monkeys, or as emotionally close as dogs.</p> <p>Besides, research teams have overwhelmingly powerful allies - the human sufferers from disease and their relatives. With Alzheimer's alone, that means campaigners against animal experiments in Britain must always be looking over their shoulders at the suffering of half a million people and the anguish of millions more family members. Some of these, doubtless, would rather see the disease left unconquered in humans than have a single mouse given the condition artificially for their sakes. But, historically, the public has always been readier to accept animal suffering to alleviate human suffering than to entertain hunters and gourmands or to test cosmetics.</p> <p>While wary, scientists are not particularly defensive where mice are concerned. At the Babraham Institute, Dr Alexander rarely sees his mice; genetically modified to have a failed immune system, they are kept in an airtight, windowless, germ-free world. No one can have access to them without stripping, showering, shampooing and going through an airlock. \"They are very well looked after. I call it mouse paradise myself,\" he says. \"They get fed, watered, looked after, the temperature is controlled and there are no cats. What more could a mouse want?\"</p> <p>Dr Lovestone, who formerly worked with mice, says: \"Sometimes you have this cognitive distance. You look after the mice fabulously carefully, and then you come home and spread poison around to try to get rid of mice from your own house.\"</p>",

Je me suis senti si fier de la confiance que le roi place en moi ! J'ai lu dans le regard du roi qu'il \u00e9tait \u00e9galement tr\u00e8s fier et \u00e9mu. Rencontrer ses sujets aussi fervents constituait le summum de sa visite officielle en France. Les instants que nous avons v\u00e9cus resteront grav\u00e9s \u00e0 jamais dans nos m\u00e9moires.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Tim Robbins</strong> has signed to play a scientist in <strong>Human Nature</strong>, the new film scripted by Being John Malkovich writer Charlie Kaufman. Robbins will join Patricia Arquette and Welsh actor Rhys Ifans in what promises to be a madcap tale about a woman plagued by excess body hair and a boy raised as an ape in the jungle. Human Nature will be financed by a joint venture from New York indie production house Good Machine and the French media group Canal Plus. Michel Gondry is already down to direct.</p> <p>Beavis and Butthead creator <strong>Mike Judge</strong> has been called in by Warner Bros with a view to co-writing and directing the studio's trouble-hit production <strong>The Incredible Mr Limpet</strong>. The eccentric part live-action part animation tale of a small-town nerd who becomes a fish who sabotaged Nazi U-boats, Limpet has been languishing in pre-production at Warners since the end of 1996. Last spring, original director Steve Odekerk quit over \"creative differences\", and last July Jim Carrey (who was due star as Mr Limpet) also bailed out. With Judge on board, Warners are expected to attempt to woo Carrey back on board. Judge made his name with the maverick TV shenanigans of Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill, and made his directorial debut last year with Office Space (straight-to-video in the UK). Warners will be hoping that 'Limpet', will do better. But for now, they're probably just praying it will get made at all. </p> <p>The Matrix franchise rolls on a-pace with the news that original star <strong>Carrie-Anne Moss</strong> has signed on to reprise her high-kicking role in two Matrix sequels, which begin production this autumn. Moss will join former cohort Keanu Reeves, and the Wachowski Brothers will once again direct. Moss will next play the role of Judi Dench's daughter in the Miramax production Chocolat, which begins shooting in France and England next month. Chocolat also stars Johnny Depp and will be helmed by Cider House Rules director Lasse Hallstrom. </p> <p><strong>Paul Newman</strong> fans take note: the 75-year-old actor plans to make one more film and then retire for good. Speaking on the David Letterman show, Newman said he would like to appear in one more movie, \"as a swansong\". Then, he said, \"that will be it.\" The Oscar-winning actor was promoting his current role as an ageing bankrobber in the warmly received comedy-drama Where the Money Is when he dropped the bombshell. He also discussed the burgeoning success of his Newman's Own food business (most noted for its line of salad dressing). \"It out-grosses my movies,\" quipped Newman. \"It's humiliating.\"</p> <p>The <strong>love-life of Winona Ryder: episode 342</strong>. Latest gossip links the elfin star of Girl, Interrupted with both Russell Crowe and Mark Wahlberg. Trouble is that she's officially still linked to long-time beau Matt Damon. The rumours were started, respectively by the magazine US Weekly and the tabloid paper The New York Post. US Weekly reported that Crowe and Damon almost came to blows over Winona at a post-Oscar party last month. The New York Post, meantime, speculated that Ryder had attempted to smooth over a purported career rivalry between Damon and Wahlberg, and ended up in bed with Wahlberg instead. Needless to say, both stories have been angrily denied by sources close to its respective stars. Dismissing the Wahlberg story, Damon spokeswoman Jennifer Glaisek could hardly contain her irritation. The nugget of gossip, she claimed, was \"the dumbest story I've ever heard.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tim Robbins has signed to play a scientist in Human Nature, the new film scripted by Being John Malkovich writer Charlie Kaufman. Robbins will join Patricia Arquette and Welsh actor Rhys Ifans in what promises to be a madcap tale about a woman plagued by excess body hair and a boy raised as an ape in the jungle. Human Nature will be financed by a joint venture from New York indie production house Good Machine and the French media group Canal Plus. Michel Gondry is already down to direct. Beavis and Butthead creator Mike Judge has been called in by Warner Bros with a view to co-writing and directing the studio's trouble-hit production The Incredible Mr Limpet. The eccentric part live-action part animation tale of a small-town nerd who becomes a fish who sabotaged Nazi U-boats, Limpet has been languishing in pre-production at Warners since the end of 1996. Last spring, original director Steve Odekerk quit over \"creative differences\", and last July Jim Carrey (who was due star as Mr Limpet) also bailed out. With Judge on board, Warners are expected to attempt to woo Carrey back on board. Judge made his name with the maverick TV shenanigans of Beavis and Butthead and King of the Hill, and made his directorial debut last year with Office Space (straight-to-video in the UK). Warners will be hoping that 'Limpet', will do better. But for now, they're probably just praying it will get made at all. The Matrix franchise rolls on a-pace with the news that original star Carrie-Anne Moss has signed on to reprise her high-kicking role in two Matrix sequels, which begin production this autumn. Moss will join former cohort Keanu Reeves, and the Wachowski Brothers will once again direct. Moss will next play the role of Judi Dench's daughter in the Miramax production Chocolat, which begins shooting in France and England next month. Chocolat also stars Johnny Depp and will be helmed by Cider House Rules director Lasse Hallstrom. Paul Newman fans take note: the 75-year-old actor plans to make one more film and then retire for good. Speaking on the David Letterman show, Newman said he would like to appear in one more movie, \"as a swansong\". Then, he said, \"that will be it.\" The Oscar-winning actor was promoting his current role as an ageing bankrobber in the warmly received comedy-drama Where the Money Is when he dropped the bombshell. He also discussed the burgeoning success of his Newman's Own food business (most noted for its line of salad dressing). \"It out-grosses my movies,\" quipped Newman. \"It's humiliating.\" The love-life of Winona Ryder: episode 342. Latest gossip links the elfin star of Girl, Interrupted with both Russell Crowe and Mark Wahlberg. Trouble is that she's officially still linked to long-time beau Matt Damon. The rumours were started, respectively by the magazine US Weekly and the tabloid paper The New York Post. US Weekly reported that Crowe and Damon almost came to blows over Winona at a post-Oscar party last month. The New York Post, meantime, speculated that Ryder had attempted to smooth over a purported career rivalry between Damon and Wahlberg, and ended up in bed with Wahlberg instead. Needless to say, both stories have been angrily denied by sources close to its respective stars. Dismissing the Wahlberg story, Damon spokeswoman Jennifer Glaisek could hardly contain her irritation. The nugget of gossip, she claimed, was \"the dumbest story I've ever heard.\"",

Every platitude about gender differences is shaken to pieces through personal anecdote, true confession, anthropology, poetry and philosophy.</p> <p>The book is a plea for liberation from all imposed shapes that twist the true nature of men and women. It is occasionally idiotic (\"Before the industrial revolution, there was no Oedipus complex\") but more often keenly acute. The men favoured by women have changed, she notes, since the arrival of the women's movement, with sugar daddies and macho men supplanted by baby-faced stars. Inequality is not just a matter of injustice but downgrades relationships into something functional. Far from needing to get in touch with their feelings, both men and women need to apply rationality to their lives and attitudes.</p> <p>Women do not get an easy time. Passivity, manipulation and the retreat into sacrifice are exposed as despicable female manoeuvres. A woman who lives through her man is called a spiritual parasite. \"That kind of love, so often called 'loyal' or 'self-sacrificing', I call the old-woman-of-the-sea syndrome. I'm afraid to get my feet wet. Carry me.\"</p> <p>Her weekly column became an icon of all that was hairy and terrifying to men who found the women's movement a threat to their security. She was parodied, ridiculed and attacked. Mostly, though, she became a focal voice of women all over Britain who wrote to her in their thousands and took courage from her to look at the truth about their lives.</p> <p>Jill's own life was full of disaster and tragedy as well as much happiness. She was implacably radical about her feminism but constantly tempered the grimness of the ideological struggle with hilarious tales of her own catastrophes. She could pour scorn like battery acid and defend the craziest of radical splinter groups just for love of revolutionary courage, but she was at bottom a wonderfully warm and balanced human being.</p> <p>What women want above all, she wrote, \"is to become real, to discard the mannered feminine mask and reveal the human being beneath, a person who is neither a Virgin Mary to be put on a pedestal, nor a Lilith to be obsessively desired, nor a Martha to wait at table; but simply a person sufficient unto herself, with her own talents and inadequacies, her own idiosyncrasies, good, bad or indifferent.\"</p> <p>Men, as lovers, husbands, friends, sons, were as essential to Jill as her women friends. She was extremely beautiful and delighted in looking good, though the nature of that delight caused tortuous debate. Her radicalism never wavered but her honesty demanded that she explore the ambivalences feminists like her were scarcely able to confess to themselves, let alone to the world.</p> <p>The result was Letters From A Faint-hearted Feminist, a new series of columns in which issues of central feminist ideology were put through the same critical wringer as the unthinking patriarchal orthodoxies that had been in her earlier columns. Could not you wear high heels with a boiler suit? Were beautiful clothes a gorgeous prison, or a legitimate choice for independent women? Was monogamy inevitably a road to servitude?</p> <p>The cleverness of those columns was Jill's ability to admit to ambivalence, to weakness and to changing her mind without compromising her beliefs in equality, independence and the destructiveness of stereotypes. In their way, they were a bridge between the revolutionary battlefields of the 70s and the next generation who rightly took their freedoms for granted and saw no reason whatever to agonise about boiler suits or PhDs.</p> <p>Jill never permitted despondency about the casual contempt in which the daughters of her contemporaries held the feminist movement. If they wanted to worship material gods and hurtle into marriage for the wrong reasons, that was the very freedom everyone had been fighting for, she said. In the end, she was optimistic that things got better: two steps forward and one back sometimes, but better.</p> <p>\"Looking about me,\" she wrote in 1989, \"I see less ritual femininity and masculinity, and more human beings, less passion but more friendliness between the sexes, less dependency, more sharing. Despite setbacks, these things make a better breeding ground for real love than was available when I was young. The river may have gone underground for a little while, but it keeps on rolling, it keeps on rolling along.\" If so, it is no small thanks to Jill Tweedie.</p>",

It is occasionally idiotic (\"Before the industrial revolution, there was no Oedipus complex\") but more often keenly acute. The men favoured by women have changed, she notes, since the arrival of the women's movement, with sugar daddies and macho men supplanted by baby-faced stars. Inequality is not just a matter of injustice but downgrades relationships into something functional. Far from needing to get in touch with their feelings, both men and women need to apply rationality to their lives and attitudes. Women do not get an easy time. Passivity, manipulation and the retreat into sacrifice are exposed as despicable female manoeuvres. A woman who lives through her man is called a spiritual parasite. \"That kind of love, so often called 'loyal' or 'self-sacrificing', I call the old-woman-of-the-sea syndrome. I'm afraid to get my feet wet. Carry me.\" Her weekly column became an icon of all that was hairy and terrifying to men who found the women's movement a threat to their security. She was parodied, ridiculed and attacked. Mostly, though, she became a focal voice of women all over Britain who wrote to her in their thousands and took courage from her to look at the truth about their lives. Jill's own life was full of disaster and tragedy as well as much happiness. She was implacably radical about her feminism but constantly tempered the grimness of the ideological struggle with hilarious tales of her own catastrophes. She could pour scorn like battery acid and defend the craziest of radical splinter groups just for love of revolutionary courage, but she was at bottom a wonderfully warm and balanced human being. What women want above all, she wrote, \"is to become real, to discard the mannered feminine mask and reveal the human being beneath, a person who is neither a Virgin Mary to be put on a pedestal, nor a Lilith to be obsessively desired, nor a Martha to wait at table; but simply a person sufficient unto herself, with her own talents and inadequacies, her own idiosyncrasies, good, bad or indifferent.\" Men, as lovers, husbands, friends, sons, were as essential to Jill as her women friends. She was extremely beautiful and delighted in looking good, though the nature of that delight caused tortuous debate. Her radicalism never wavered but her honesty demanded that she explore the ambivalences feminists like her were scarcely able to confess to themselves, let alone to the world. The result was Letters From A Faint-hearted Feminist, a new series of columns in which issues of central feminist ideology were put through the same critical wringer as the unthinking patriarchal orthodoxies that had been in her earlier columns. Could not you wear high heels with a boiler suit? Were beautiful clothes a gorgeous prison, or a legitimate choice for independent women? Was monogamy inevitably a road to servitude? The cleverness of those columns was Jill's ability to admit to ambivalence, to weakness and to changing her mind without compromising her beliefs in equality, independence and the destructiveness of stereotypes. In their way, they were a bridge between the revolutionary battlefields of the 70s and the next generation who rightly took their freedoms for granted and saw no reason whatever to agonise about boiler suits or PhDs. Jill never permitted despondency about the casual contempt in which the daughters of her contemporaries held the feminist movement. If they wanted to worship material gods and hurtle into marriage for the wrong reasons, that was the very freedom everyone had been fighting for, she said. In the end, she was optimistic that things got better: two steps forward and one back sometimes, but better. \"Looking about me,\" she wrote in 1989, \"I see less ritual femininity and masculinity, and more human beings, less passion but more friendliness between the sexes, less dependency, more sharing. Despite setbacks, these things make a better breeding ground for real love than was available when I was young. The river may have gone underground for a little while, but it keeps on rolling, it keeps on rolling along.\" If so, it is no small thanks to Jill Tweedie.",

The authorities recently told locals to remove a \"welcome home Elian\" banner which had been put up in his home town of Cardenas; after months of accusing his enemies in Florida of \"psychologically torturing\" the boy, Fidel Castro has promised to keep the crowds of well-wishers with cameras away from Elian, in deliberate contrast to the circus that has engulfed his residence in Miami. For some in Havana, the saga cannot end soon enough. \"Lets hope it goes back to normal and [Castro] doesn't find something else to substitute it with,\" said Alfredo Roldan, who said that he could not bear to watch television any more. For Cuba's 72-year-old president, it has been a win-win situation from the start. The highly orchestrated rallies with their speeches blasting US decadence, high crime rates and consumerism have helped him to reinstate patriotism and revolutionary values within the island's youth. It has also given him the perfect platform in the US to campaign against the Cuban-American leaders he regards as his real enemies, isolating them from Washington. The Cuban leader has repeatedly compared the battle for custody with the 1961 defeat of the CIA-backed exiles' invasion at the Bay of Pigs. Appropriately, the invasion's anniversary was yesterday. \"They lack brains,\" he said, comparing Miami's Cuban exiles to the invading troops who got stuck in the mangrove swamps. \"The more they move, the deeper they sink in the mud.\" Behind the dispute lies the politics of Washington's 40-year-old trade embargo against Cuba, and President Castro blames the massive Cuban-American influence in US politics for the continuation of the embargo. In a political twist, Cuban television has been portraying Bill Clinton, the attorney general, Janet Reno, and the US authorities as the good guys for the last few months, finally standing up to the bad guys in Miami. The island's television has even suggested that anger within the Clinton administration with the Cuban-Americans in Miami could prompt the president to lift the ban on US tourists travelling to Cuba. Ironically, this development may not serve President Castro well; a huge influx of US tourists and better relations with Washington could make it harder to maintain socialist values at home. Even before the case broke, the government was trying to combat what it viewed as an invasion of US culture from across the Florida Straits, helped by the free circulation of family remittances made in US dollars. The battle for Elian has not stopped this, a fact the Cuban leader cannot help but notice. When he appeared live on television with the 12 classmates of Elian he was hoping to send to Washington with Elian's father last week, one of them was asked what music he would take to give Elian. \"The Backstreet Boys,\" the six-year-old instantly replied.

      "bodyText": "Supergrasses who claim they have been short-changed in rewards for information have no right to sue, a high court judge ruled yesterday. The judgment was given in the case of Keith Robinson, an informant who claimed the sum of \u00a333,574 with interest for an alleged breach of contract against customs and excise whom he said had promised him reasonable remuneration and expenses. Mr Robinson, who ran a vehicle repair business in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, alleged that his customs \"minders\" had promised he would be handsomely rewarded after he agreed that a tracking device could be fitted in a Mercedes van that drug smugglers kept at his premises. In the first case of its kind, Mr Justice Douglas Brown held that no contract existed and that, on grounds of public policy, \"an informant cannot maintain a claim against the commissioners [of customs and excise] or indeed a chief officer of police in respect of any reward for information supplied\". Mr Robinson, who received just under \u00a310,000 for information which led to the jailing of a drug smuggler for 10 years, complained that he had been promised that amount for the drugs conviction alone. He said he was owed far more for the help he gave in relation to an insurance fraud and other drugs offences. He claimed he had at first only received \u00a36,500 but had continued to provide information to customs, receiving a number of other payments, the highest of which was \u00a3500. In the end he had received a total of \u00a39,150. He claimed he was \"short changed\" and that he had a legally enforceable contract which entitled him to more. The judge, held that Mr Robinson, whom he described as \"a highly unreliable witness\", had not been promised handsome rewards or specific sums. He said there was no contract or any intention to create \"legal relations\". Customs and excise denied that the money had been offered for the information leading to that arrest. The judge said that when Mr Robinson had initially agreed to assist the customs officers and provide information he would have regarded any suggestion that he might mount a court fight over payment as \"wholly inimical to his personal safety\". Mr Robinson had been told he could not receive a wage for being an informant and that he would only be paid through the reward system operated by customs. To allow an informant to sue would involve the court in an examination of sensitive matters and the \"unthinkable\" disclosure of information, normally subject to public interest immunity, in the presence of a claimant \"who was either a criminal or on the fringes of crime\", the judge said. The judge added that unscrupulous informants might bring claims with little or no merit with the object of forcing the authorities to settle rather than of revealing sources of information. The judge granted customs and excise an order blocking the claim on the ground that he had no reasonable prospect of success. After the tracking device had been fitted in the Mercedes van, Mr Robinson was told by conspirators that the plan was to import 20 tons of cannabis into Britain from Italy. The van was stopped at Dover in July 1994 and three-quarters of a ton of the drug was seized. The driver was convicted and jailed for 10 years. Mr Robinson claimed that his information had led to French police making three arrests and also seizing large amounts of drugs.",

Miners! The pits! Helmeted men shuffling through the morning darkness, their tins of snap at their sides! The shock troops of the Labour movement! It's as if a Tory government had decided to save Britain's last half dozen army units, and only a handful of their own backbenchers had turned up to give an opinion.</p> <p>Dennis Skinner was there, of course, but as he pointed out, there were no mines left in his constituency. You would think this was a terrific blow, as if the MP for Tunbridge Wells (Archie Norman) had to confess to the death of all colonels drinking pink gin through bristly moustaches. A little bit of England would have gone.</p> <p>The Tories, said Mr Skinner, had got a cheek opposing subsidies for the remaining mines, when they had called for hundreds of millions to go to farmers. \"We should have taken the coal industry back into public ownership!\" he yelled, and you could see the smug little smiles on the Labour benches. Dear old Dennis, coming up with yet another crazy idea! Whatever next? Re-nationalise the railways, I suppose! Like the gin-drinking colonels, Dennis seems to them a symbol of a vanished era - comical, to be sure, but admirable in his own funny way as well.</p> <p>Mr Byers smiled a condescending little smile too, and said, \"our option 15 was renationalisation, but we didn't take it any further\".</p> <p>He had made a statement in the sub-McKinsey management drivel which ministers affect these days. It is meant to sound American and cutting edge, but like British hot dogs, never quite works.</p> <p>He spoke of \"market diversity\", \"consents policy\", and \"energy parks\". Firms in the industry were \"players\". As for the coal industry, it would need to \"meet new challenges... to move forward, to manage change rather than be submerged by it, and\" - we paused for a threatening roll of drums - \"respond to the challenges ahead!\".</p> <p>This always means, \"we have no real hope that the pits will survive, but at least we can't be blamed if they don't respond to the challenges\". He finished by saying: \"this is good news for hard working people and their families\".</p> <p>\"Hard working people\" is one of those phrases used by our government when they are painting one of their great capitalist realism canvases to be hoisted aloft before our wondering gaze. It implies honest, upright folk, men and women who don't want to sponge off the state, people who respond to the challenges ahead with a far-sighted gleam in their eye.</p> <p>What it means, of course, is people who work all the hours god sends, with poor pay, lousy benefits and as much security as a field mouse at harvest time.</p> <p>Still, Mr Byers knows that for the next few months at least, his main contender will be Angela Browning, and this must console him during those long nights when he wakes up sweating under the duvet.</p> <p>Mrs Browning has the perpetual air of a middle-class woman complaining loudly to a police officer.</p> <p>\"His rationale was bogus, Madam Speaker!\", she shouted, as if describing a doorstep mugger.</p> <p>She began to mix her metaphors. \"Our aim is to put all fuels on a level playing field,\" she declared.</p> <p>\"This department runs on a piecemeal basis, and conducts policy on the hoof!\" she added.

Dennis Skinner was there, of course, but as he pointed out, there were no mines left in his constituency. You would think this was a terrific blow, as if the MP for Tunbridge Wells (Archie Norman) had to confess to the death of all colonels drinking pink gin through bristly moustaches. A little bit of England would have gone. The Tories, said Mr Skinner, had got a cheek opposing subsidies for the remaining mines, when they had called for hundreds of millions to go to farmers. \"We should have taken the coal industry back into public ownership!\" he yelled, and you could see the smug little smiles on the Labour benches. Dear old Dennis, coming up with yet another crazy idea! Whatever next? Re-nationalise the railways, I suppose! Like the gin-drinking colonels, Dennis seems to them a symbol of a vanished era - comical, to be sure, but admirable in his own funny way as well. Mr Byers smiled a condescending little smile too, and said, \"our option 15 was renationalisation, but we didn't take it any further\". He had made a statement in the sub-McKinsey management drivel which ministers affect these days. It is meant to sound American and cutting edge, but like British hot dogs, never quite works. He spoke of \"market diversity\", \"consents policy\", and \"energy parks\". Firms in the industry were \"players\". As for the coal industry, it would need to \"meet new challenges... to move forward, to manage change rather than be submerged by it, and\" - we paused for a threatening roll of drums - \"respond to the challenges ahead!\". This always means, \"we have no real hope that the pits will survive, but at least we can't be blamed if they don't respond to the challenges\". He finished by saying: \"this is good news for hard working people and their families\". \"Hard working people\" is one of those phrases used by our government when they are painting one of their great capitalist realism canvases to be hoisted aloft before our wondering gaze. It implies honest, upright folk, men and women who don't want to sponge off the state, people who respond to the challenges ahead with a far-sighted gleam in their eye. What it means, of course, is people who work all the hours god sends, with poor pay, lousy benefits and as much security as a field mouse at harvest time. Still, Mr Byers knows that for the next few months at least, his main contender will be Angela Browning, and this must console him during those long nights when he wakes up sweating under the duvet. Mrs Browning has the perpetual air of a middle-class woman complaining loudly to a police officer. \"His rationale was bogus, Madam Speaker!\", she shouted, as if describing a doorstep mugger. She began to mix her metaphors. \"Our aim is to put all fuels on a level playing field,\" she declared. \"This department runs on a piecemeal basis, and conducts policy on the hoof!\" she added. These weren't just being mixed; they were whizzed up in an industrial sized blender.",

      "bodyText": "Britain is preparing for an influx of Zimbabweans fleeing from the violent land battle which at the weekend led to the murders of a white farmer and two black members of the main opposition party. The home secretary, Jack Straw, made clear yesterday that many of the new arrivals, who have British ancestry - if only one grandparent - are not expected to have to go through Britain's new \"below the breadline\" asylum system but instead will be given long-term permission to stay. Both the European Union and the Commonwealth expressed extreme concern yesterday about the deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe, which is in danger of a descent into anarchy. Britain tried to ratchet up international pressure on the Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, by pressing African nations to push for a \"return to the rule of law\" in the former British colony. With the mood turning increasingly ugly in Harare, President Mugabe has remained unrepentant about the violence which has accompanied the occupation of at least 500 white-owned farms by supporters of his Zanu-PF party. But representatives of the white farmers said Mr Mugabe assured them yesterday that he would act to restore order, although he stopped short of ordering squatters to leave occupied farms. \"I just get the feeling that he was feeling fairly determined to get the situation back to normal as soon as possible,\" Commercial Farmers' Union president Tim Henwood said after meeting Mr Mugabe. Up to 20,000 Zimbabweans are believed to have the right to come to Britain on the grounds that their parents or grandparents were born in the country. The long queues of those nervously applying to renew their British \"certificate of entitlement\" filled the halls of the offices of the British high commission in Harare's city centre yesterday. The numbers of people going to the British consular office to inquire about their status as British citizens and their right to reside in Britain increased dramatically, presumably as a result of the weekend killing of a white farmer and the beatings of five others. \"It was busy, very busy,\" said Richard Lindsay of the high commission. The rush of people included people renewing old British passports that had expired, others asking about their eligibility for British residency and some simply registering so they can be contacted in case of an emergency. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, one of Mr Mugabe's sternest critics, said yesterday that the secretary general of the Organisation of African Unity, Salim Ahmed Salim, had told him he would discuss the violence in Zimbabwe with southern African leaders. Mr Cook said the Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, had also sent his foreign minister, Sule Lamido, to Harare to express concern at the violence. \"I'm very pleased that we have got the Organisation of African Unity also engaged in joining in that international pressure to try and secure an outcome in Zimbabwe that will enable us to find a way forward,\" Mr Cook said. Most of those Zimbabweans who have a British connection are white, although some black and Asians also have had relatives in the UK. Those who have a parent who was born in Britain are exempted from the asylum and immigration laws and can enter Britain freely on their Commonwealth passports, the Home Office said yesterday. They are entitled to claim British citizenship but have to obtain a certificate of entitlement from the high commission before they travel. The second group entitled to come to Britain without having to undergo the complex and lengthy asylum process, including dispersal and living on \"below the breadline\" vouchers, are those who can demonstrate that one of their grandparents was born in Britain. Under the UK \"ancestry regulations\" those who can demonstrate a family connection are allowed to enter Britain for an initial period of four years without the need for a work permit. A Home Office spokesman said last night that they had to be looking to work in Britain without recourse to public funds. After four years they could apply to become a permanent resident. It was clear yesterday in London that Mr Straw and Barbara Roche, the immigration minister, have been briefed in detail by Home Office officials to expect a sudden significant rise in the numbers fleeing from Zimbabwe. \"In many cases people from Zimbabwe may have grounds for coming here in any case because they have relatives who are British,\" said Mr Straw. \"If their parents are British they have a right to come.

As pro-Chechen demonstrators noisily protested outside Downing Street, Mr Putin made a passionate defence of Russia's offensive in Chechnya, warning that European countries were afraid of offending their own Muslim inhabitants: \"Western Europe could pay heavily for this.\" The former KGB officer held more than three hours of talks with Tony Blair at Downing Street and later had a 30-minute audience with the Queen at Windsor Castle. Mr Blair gave a tentative welcome to the new commission and rejected criticism that he had put commerce ahead of human rights in inviting Mr Putin to Britain. \"Some say that because of our concerns about Chechnya we should keep some distance from Moscow.

He named his daughter after the murdered German revolutionary, Rosa Luxembourg, but was himself soon facing a 12-month prison sentence for sedition and incitement.</p> <p>Three years later, in 1928, Rust, the epitome of the dedicated British communist, set off for Moscow with his wife and child to work for the Comintern. Once there, Rosa aged three, promptly went down with scarlet fever; she recovered, but came out of hospital having forgotten how to speak English.</p> <p>By 1930 the Rusts' marriage was over, and, back in London, Bill Rust was appointed as the first editor of the Daily Worker. In 1937, as Stalin's great terror reached its climax in the Soviet Union, Rosa's mother also came back to England. She promised to return for Rosa, but Bill suggested that the child would be better off in the Soviet Union. So their daughter was left at a boarding school for the children of top foreign communists, a few miles from Moscow - other pupils included the offspring of the future Yugoslav leader Marshal Tito, the future Hungarian leader Matyas Rakosi, and China's Mao Tse Tung.</p> <p>By 1940, Rosa was living in a Moscow hostel for political immigrants, and loving it, with morning classes and evenings taken up with theatre, music and cinema. Then, in June 1941, came the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, and, within a month, the Luftwaffe was bombing Moscow. Her parents assumed she was safe but, amidst the chaos of war, the Soviet bureaucracy sucked her in, put her with a group of German exiles and sent her to the Soviet Union's Volga German republic, near the frontline.</p> <p>On the Volga, Rosa made friends with Hannah, an older German Jewish woman. Hannah, weighing little more than seven stone, was physically weak; Rosa looked after her, and Hannah taught Rosa about survival. They shared a deserted house, and the 16-year-old worked 12-hour shifts in a canning factory.</p> <p>Then, three months later, the militia came calling. Hannah, as a German, was to be deported to Kazakhstan. Rosa stood by her friend, and stumbled into one of Stalin's greatest crimes - the forced migration of hundreds of thousands of Volga Germans to the far corners of the vast country. For the rest of her life, one of Rosa's most insistent questions was, where are they now, the Volga Germans?</p> <p>The two women travelled on horse and cart for 36 hours to Astrakhan, a transit centre for thousands of deportees. Then came three days on an open boat along the Caspian Sea to Guryev, followed by six weeks in railway cattle trucks. En route, a young woman nursing her four-month-old daughter, left the train to search for hot water. The train started without her - and Rosa was left, literally holding the baby. It took the mother a week to catch up, whereupon Rosa returned the infant alive and well.</p> <p>Lice-ridden and close to starvation, they arrived in Kazakhstan, where Hannah and Rosa were separated. For two years, Rosa was worked close to death in the copper mines, pushing and emptying metal-laden rail trucks from 6am until after dusk. She never saw the sun. Back in London, oblivious to this suffering, her father was at the Daily Worker, still extolling the Soviet Union.</p> <p>Malnutrition made Rosa half-blind, and turned her skin yellow. She avoided death only thanks to a letter that she wrote to a Moscow friend, asking that it be forwarded to someone in authority. It found its way to Georgi Dimitrov, general-secretary of the Comintern, and later ruler of communist Bulgaria. In spring 1943, a pass arrived, signed personally by Dimitrov. Weeks later, Rosa arrived in Moscow.</p> <p>She told Dimitrov that she wanted to go to England, but would not leave until Hannah, and a dozen or so other Volga Germans, were rescued. Hannah was released, and Rosa boarded a convoy for Leith, from where she was sent to London. Neither the British government - then the wartime ally of the Soviet Union - nor the British Communist party had any interest in revealing what had happened to Rust's daughter, or news of cattle-trucks and deportations.</p> <p>Rosa Rust was 19 before she had mastered English - after studying at the Regent Street Polytechnic - and, in later years, recalled how, in those early days, she had tried to post letters in bins marked \"litter\" and thought railway stations were called \"Bovril\" because that was what the posters said. After leaving the polytechnic, she worked as a translator for the Soviet news agency, Tass, until the Foreign Office closed it down in 1951. She married George Thornton, a brilliant young historian, whose career was later damaged by his association with Rosa and leftwing views.</p> <p>Rosa soon discovered that she loved English poetry as much as she loved Pushkin, and became one of the most fluent and articulate people you could meet. All her life she could recite, among great swathes of other poetry, her first ever English poem: GK Chesterton's The Donkey. The passion and intensity of her voice, and the rhythm of the words, were given an extra dimension by her Russian accent.</p> <p>Anyone who met Rosa sensed the inner strength that brought her out of Russia alive. And they too sensed the instinct of loyalty and rebellion that got her into the camps in the first place. She talked of it in a deep, clear voice full of great, gay Russian-sounding gusts of poetry and laughter.</p> <p>She starred in the drama group she set up near Redcar, Yorkshire, where she and her husband lived. The actress Anna Calder-Marshall, who planned to present a one-woman show about Rosa's life, observed that there was only one person who could really play Rosa - and that was Rosa. She was, Calder-Marshall added, one of the most brilliant actresses she had ever met.</p> <p>Rosa and George Thornton were devoted to each other for more than half a century, sharing a passion for drama and poetry, cricket and music, and walking by the sea. She died a Yorkshire grandmother with a Russian accent, leaving her husband, four grown-up children, and five grandchildren - who always called her \"Babu\", short for babushka, the Russian for grandmother. <br> <b>Rosa Thornton (n\u00e9e Rust), born April 26 1925; died April 2 2000.</b></p>",

Rosa Rust was 19 before she had mastered English - after studying at the Regent Street Polytechnic - and, in later years, recalled how, in those early days, she had tried to post letters in bins marked \"litter\" and thought railway stations were called \"Bovril\" because that was what the posters said. After leaving the polytechnic, she worked as a translator for the Soviet news agency, Tass, until the Foreign Office closed it down in 1951. She married George Thornton, a brilliant young historian, whose career was later damaged by his association with Rosa and leftwing views. Rosa soon discovered that she loved English poetry as much as she loved Pushkin, and became one of the most fluent and articulate people you could meet. All her life she could recite, among great swathes of other poetry, her first ever English poem: GK Chesterton's The Donkey. The passion and intensity of her voice, and the rhythm of the words, were given an extra dimension by her Russian accent. Anyone who met Rosa sensed the inner strength that brought her out of Russia alive. And they too sensed the instinct of loyalty and rebellion that got her into the camps in the first place. She talked of it in a deep, clear voice full of great, gay Russian-sounding gusts of poetry and laughter. She starred in the drama group she set up near Redcar, Yorkshire, where she and her husband lived. The actress Anna Calder-Marshall, who planned to present a one-woman show about Rosa's life, observed that there was only one person who could really play Rosa - and that was Rosa. She was, Calder-Marshall added, one of the most brilliant actresses she had ever met. Rosa and George Thornton were devoted to each other for more than half a century, sharing a passion for drama and poetry, cricket and music, and walking by the sea. She died a Yorkshire grandmother with a Russian accent, leaving her husband, four grown-up children, and five grandchildren - who always called her \"Babu\", short for babushka, the Russian for grandmother. Rosa Thornton (n\u00e9e Rust), born April 26 1925; died April 2 2000.",

      "byline": "Tim Ashley",

      "body": "<p>'It all began when I was a student,\" says David Pountney. \"That's when I discovered Janacek. After that, I simply wanted to know what went before and what came since.\" The opera director, who next week is bringing Bohuslav Martinu's The Greek Passion to Covent Garden, is talking about one of his abiding passions - Czech music. \"It speaks to me directly, intuitively. I was in Prague recently, and someone said to me: 'You're the man who's directed 14 Czech operas.' \" He smiles with pride. </p> <p>Pountney's relationship with Czech opera is symbiotic. He made his professional debut in 1972 with Janacek's Katya Kabanova at the Wexford festival. Between 1975 and 1980, he was at Scottish Opera - and it was his Janacek cycle that lingers in the memory. His much-imitated staging of Dvorak's Rusalka at the Coliseum in 1981 took London by storm, and was instrumental in forging the style of ENO's so-called \"powerhouse\" years, during which Pountney was director of productions. </p> <p>Listening to him, you realise just how formative his discovery of Janacek has been. One constantly finds points of consonance between Pountney's productions (regardless of who wrote the actual opera) and Janacek's scores: the same combination of intelligent fixity, concise detail and dense emotion; a comparable insistence on peeling back the layers of the psyche and unflinchingly probing the human soul. </p> <p>His work has caused a drastic reappraisal of Czech music. Rusalka - a variant of The Little Mermaid - was considered twee until Pountney unearthed the Freudian monstrosity beneath its surface. Janacek's Osud (Fate) was once deemed both a dramatic nightmare and a musical failure. Pountney proved that the piece made perfect sense. He will have to force London audiences to rethink The Greek Passion, too (his production opened at Austria's Bregenz festival last summer), for Martinu has a precarious reputation. </p> <p>\"He's the least Czech of Czech composers,\" says Pountney. \"He's cosmopolitan.\" Pinning Martinu down is never easy. The music reflects the man, for he was in some respects nomadic, an eternal wanderer. </p> <p>He was born (atop a church tower, famously) in the village of Policka in 1890, began composing when he was 10, and later played the fiddle in the Czech Philharmonic until a bursary took him to Paris to study in 1923. France was his home until 1940, when the Nazis arrived. He fled to the US, wound up in New York, and loathed it - but the experience of enforced exile radically affected his music. With the exception of his 1938 opera Julietta (Pountney directed it for Opera North last year), his best work dates from the end of his career. The Greek Passion occupied him from 1955 until his death in 1959. </p> <p>On one level, the opera is a harrowing distillation of the experiences of his miserable last years. Ill with cancer, he was on the move again. In the US, he'd fallen foul of the McCarthyites. In Prague, meanwhile, the communist government had dubbed him \"the servant of reaction\". \"He didn't know where to be,\" says Pountney. \"He wrote the opera in something like 30 different addresses.\" </p> <p>Dispossession is one of the central themes of The Greek Passion. The other is the messy bifurcation between the Christian message and the often appalling acts committed in its name. Unlike most Passion music, the opera throws the redemptive Easter message a fairly hefty challenge. </p> <p>Its immediate source was the 1951 novel Christ Re-crucified by Nikos Kazantzakis, whose work can still whip up a storm, as Martin Scorsese discovered when he filmed The Last Temptation of Christ. Martinu wrote the libretto himself in English with Kazantzakis's approval. </p> <p> The setting is the aftermath of the first world war, when there was still a Turkish presence in Greece and the political map of the Balkans was being redrawn. The church elders of a Greek village are casting their annual Passion play from among the local residents: the shepherd Manolios is to play Christ; a young widow of dubious morals is given the role of Mary Magdalen; her vicious, embittered lover takes on Judas. Their preparations are interrupted by the arrival of a group of refugees, victims of Turkish violence. The village authorities refuse them shelter, but the apostles of the Passion play side with the homeless. Life, art and scripture slowly intertwine and, at the end, Manolios-Christ is recrucified by his own community as the refugees are forced to move on. </p> <p>\"Kazantzakis was a communist,\" says Pountney. \"The book was written to expose religion. Martinu is more equivocal. It's about how religious feeling produces both good and evil.\" When the production opened in Bregenz, however, it was the opera's political elements that struck the deepest resonance. With the horror of Bosnia fresh in everyone's minds, some critics thought Pountney had updated the work to the present. He hadn't, \"but it's so actual you would think it was now,\" he says. </p> <p>We are talking in one of the Royal Opera's rehearsal rooms, a white, antiseptic cube transfigured by Stefanos Lazaridis's phenomenal set. Vast gilded wooden pillars soar to the ceiling, intersected by vertical, cruciform bars. Ramps and walkways spiral up to vertiginous platforms. Incense burners, candles, banners and icons are propped against the walls. Pountney takes a prop Easter egg from a wicker basket, and rocks it between his hands. \"The set is based on the stations of the cross,\" he says, \"though we've only got seven platforms rather than 14. It also represents the stages of an itinerant miracle play. If you really want a reason to get into Pseuds Corner, it's also a double helix. It's life itself.\" </p> <p>Life remained unkind to Martinu. He never saw The Greek Passion staged. In 1957, he offered the opera to Covent Garden, where the music director was his compatriot, the legendary Rafael Kubelik. Kubelik was keen, but the piece was turned down by the Royal Opera's board, for reasons that have never fully been established. </p> <p>Martinu went away and rewrote the piece virtually from scratch. The second version was finally premiered in Zurich in 1961 and has remained until now the standard performing edition, though Pountney and the conductor Charles Mackerras (another ardent champion of Czech music, though he and Pountney have rarely worked together) are reverting to the original score. </p> <p>Pountney finds \"the sheer momentum\" of the first version over whelming. \"Martinu was one of the first composers to experiment with combinations of theatre and film. The first version has a cinematic approach - there's a collage-like feeling. It accumulates power through layering. Later, it all became much more conventional.\" </p> <p>For Pountney, this is just the start: later this year he's off to Prague to stage The Soldier and The Dancer, a virtually unknown product of Martinu's Paris years. \"It's very different,\" he says. \"It's a kind of bizarre 20s cabaret. It's full of charlestons, jazz, black musicians. It's like the world of Josephine Baker - but the plot's based on Plautus. I haven't quite figured out how to make sense of it yet.\" </p> <p>There is, perhaps, a reason for Pountney's devotion to The Greek Passion which runs deeper than his obvious love of the music. \"Opera has a social and communal function,\" he says. It's a way of stating the political importance of the imagination. An opera house should be the property of the citizens, a place where they come to celebrate the imagination. A society with no imagination is a monster.\" </p> <p>He could be talking about The Greek Passion itself. The opera catalogues humanity's dismal record of spiritual and political failure. Yet, as Manolios and his Apostles grow quite literally into their roles, it also celebrates the power of the theatrical experience to sharpen moral awareness, to heighten the imagination - and, ultimately, to change lives. </p> <p>\u0095 The Greek Passion is at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (020-7304 4000), from Tuesday till May 8.</p>",

      "bodyText": "'It all began when I was a student,\" says David Pountney. \"That's when I discovered Janacek. After that, I simply wanted to know what went before and what came since.\" The opera director, who next week is bringing Bohuslav Martinu's The Greek Passion to Covent Garden, is talking about one of his abiding passions - Czech music. \"It speaks to me directly, intuitively. I was in Prague recently, and someone said to me: 'You're the man who's directed 14 Czech operas.' \" He smiles with pride. Pountney's relationship with Czech opera is symbiotic. He made his professional debut in 1972 with Janacek's Katya Kabanova at the Wexford festival. Between 1975 and 1980, he was at Scottish Opera - and it was his Janacek cycle that lingers in the memory. His much-imitated staging of Dvorak's Rusalka at the Coliseum in 1981 took London by storm, and was instrumental in forging the style of ENO's so-called \"powerhouse\" years, during which Pountney was director of productions. Listening to him, you realise just how formative his discovery of Janacek has been. One constantly finds points of consonance between Pountney's productions (regardless of who wrote the actual opera) and Janacek's scores: the same combination of intelligent fixity, concise detail and dense emotion; a comparable insistence on peeling back the layers of the psyche and unflinchingly probing the human soul. His work has caused a drastic reappraisal of Czech music. Rusalka - a variant of The Little Mermaid - was considered twee until Pountney unearthed the Freudian monstrosity beneath its surface. Janacek's Osud (Fate) was once deemed both a dramatic nightmare and a musical failure. Pountney proved that the piece made perfect sense. He will have to force London audiences to rethink The Greek Passion, too (his production opened at Austria's Bregenz festival last summer), for Martinu has a precarious reputation. \"He's the least Czech of Czech composers,\" says Pountney. \"He's cosmopolitan.\" Pinning Martinu down is never easy. The music reflects the man, for he was in some respects nomadic, an eternal wanderer. He was born (atop a church tower, famously) in the village of Policka in 1890, began composing when he was 10, and later played the fiddle in the Czech Philharmonic until a bursary took him to Paris to study in 1923. France was his home until 1940, when the Nazis arrived. He fled to the US, wound up in New York, and loathed it - but the experience of enforced exile radically affected his music. With the exception of his 1938 opera Julietta (Pountney directed it for Opera North last year), his best work dates from the end of his career. The Greek Passion occupied him from 1955 until his death in 1959. On one level, the opera is a harrowing distillation of the experiences of his miserable last years. Ill with cancer, he was on the move again. In the US, he'd fallen foul of the McCarthyites. In Prague, meanwhile, the communist government had dubbed him \"the servant of reaction\". \"He didn't know where to be,\" says Pountney. \"He wrote the opera in something like 30 different addresses.\" Dispossession is one of the central themes of The Greek Passion. The other is the messy bifurcation between the Christian message and the often appalling acts committed in its name. Unlike most Passion music, the opera throws the redemptive Easter message a fairly hefty challenge. Its immediate source was the 1951 novel Christ Re-crucified by Nikos Kazantzakis, whose work can still whip up a storm, as Martin Scorsese discovered when he filmed The Last Temptation of Christ. Martinu wrote the libretto himself in English with Kazantzakis's approval. The setting is the aftermath of the first world war, when there was still a Turkish presence in Greece and the political map of the Balkans was being redrawn. The church elders of a Greek village are casting their annual Passion play from among the local residents: the shepherd Manolios is to play Christ; a young widow of dubious morals is given the role of Mary Magdalen; her vicious, embittered lover takes on Judas. Their preparations are interrupted by the arrival of a group of refugees, victims of Turkish violence. The village authorities refuse them shelter, but the apostles of the Passion play side with the homeless. Life, art and scripture slowly intertwine and, at the end, Manolios-Christ is recrucified by his own community as the refugees are forced to move on. \"Kazantzakis was a communist,\" says Pountney. \"The book was written to expose religion. Martinu is more equivocal. It's about how religious feeling produces both good and evil.\" When the production opened in Bregenz, however, it was the opera's political elements that struck the deepest resonance. With the horror of Bosnia fresh in everyone's minds, some critics thought Pountney had updated the work to the present. He hadn't, \"but it's so actual you would think it was now,\" he says. We are talking in one of the Royal Opera's rehearsal rooms, a white, antiseptic cube transfigured by Stefanos Lazaridis's phenomenal set. Vast gilded wooden pillars soar to the ceiling, intersected by vertical, cruciform bars. Ramps and walkways spiral up to vertiginous platforms. Incense burners, candles, banners and icons are propped against the walls. Pountney takes a prop Easter egg from a wicker basket, and rocks it between his hands. \"The set is based on the stations of the cross,\" he says, \"though we've only got seven platforms rather than 14. It also represents the stages of an itinerant miracle play. If you really want a reason to get into Pseuds Corner, it's also a double helix. It's life itself.\" Life remained unkind to Martinu. He never saw The Greek Passion staged. In 1957, he offered the opera to Covent Garden, where the music director was his compatriot, the legendary Rafael Kubelik. Kubelik was keen, but the piece was turned down by the Royal Opera's board, for reasons that have never fully been established. Martinu went away and rewrote the piece virtually from scratch. The second version was finally premiered in Zurich in 1961 and has remained until now the standard performing edition, though Pountney and the conductor Charles Mackerras (another ardent champion of Czech music, though he and Pountney have rarely worked together) are reverting to the original score. Pountney finds \"the sheer momentum\" of the first version over whelming. \"Martinu was one of the first composers to experiment with combinations of theatre and film. The first version has a cinematic approach - there's a collage-like feeling. It accumulates power through layering. Later, it all became much more conventional.\" For Pountney, this is just the start: later this year he's off to Prague to stage The Soldier and The Dancer, a virtually unknown product of Martinu's Paris years. \"It's very different,\" he says. \"It's a kind of bizarre 20s cabaret. It's full of charlestons, jazz, black musicians. It's like the world of Josephine Baker - but the plot's based on Plautus. I haven't quite figured out how to make sense of it yet.\" There is, perhaps, a reason for Pountney's devotion to The Greek Passion which runs deeper than his obvious love of the music. \"Opera has a social and communal function,\" he says. It's a way of stating the political importance of the imagination. An opera house should be the property of the citizens, a place where they come to celebrate the imagination. A society with no imagination is a monster.\" He could be talking about The Greek Passion itself. The opera catalogues humanity's dismal record of spiritual and political failure. Yet, as Manolios and his Apostles grow quite literally into their roles, it also celebrates the power of the theatrical experience to sharpen moral awareness, to heighten the imagination - and, ultimately, to change lives. \u0095 The Greek Passion is at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (020-7304 4000), from Tuesday till May 8.",

      "bodyText": "France is to compensate Holocaust survivors and their families after a government report published yesterday revealed that property and cash worth more than \u00a3800m was seized from the Jewish community during the second world war. More than \u00a3200m of that is still held by the government and other financial institutions, according to an inquiry team headed by a Gaullist former labour minister, Jean Matteoli, which was allowed access to files sealed for more than 50 years. Yesterday, the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, was handed 10 volumes of findings which said that restitution of confiscated property was important but was not the investigations's essential conclusion. \"Before it became a matter of money, spoliation was an act of persecution which led to extermination,\" the commission said, emphasising the Vichy regime's complicity in the murder of Jews. Most of the property and money was seized under anti-semitic laws promulgated by Philippe P\u00e9tain's government, but personal articles worth another \u00a320m were stolen from Jews awaiting deportation in French concentration camps. More than 76,000 French Jews were sent to die in Germany. Only 2,500 survived. The first attempt since the war to estimate the monetary cost of official persecution followed a policy change after the 14-year reign of Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand ended in 1995. The Jewish community blamed him for holding up reparations and obstructing the trials of collaborators. His Gaullist successor, Jacques Chirac, publicly condemned Vichy as a criminal regime and called for reparations. The 11-member commission appointed by the then prime minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9, included historians, diplomats and members of the Jewish community, including the Nazi-hunter Serge Klarsfeld and the president of French Jewish institutions, Jean Kahn. They discovered that much of the looted property had been given back, but that Fr1.4bn of assets was still in government holdings and another Fr1bn in the hands of other financial instititutions. Most of the stolen property cannot be restored because the owners were gassed after being transported to Germany in trains guarded by the French gendarmerie. One key aspect of the report was a recommendation to use unclaimed funds to set up a foundation to encourage study of the period by teachers, historians and human rights workers. This will be aided by the opening up of many previously inaccessible archives, including the Paris police records of mass round-ups and internments. Applications for compensation will be heard by another commission headed by a judge, Pierre Drai, but no one is sure how many survivors and their families will apply. An estimated 330,000 Jews lived in France during the war and many were subject to expropriations of homes and businesses. Two statutes which banned French Jews from earning a living made it easier for Vichy to confiscate 80,000 bank accounts and seize 6,000 personal safes. More than 90% of this was given back after the war. The inquiry team separated Vichy's legalised spoliation from mass looting by the Nazis. Most of this stolen property, including 100,000 works of art, has been returned, but 2,000 paintings are still on display in French museums because their owners cannot be found. The findings are online at www.ladocfrancaise.gouv.fr, which includes an exhaustive list of archives open to the public. The most useful are the files of the general commissariat on the Jewish question, which carried out aryanisation programmes and recorded transactions to the last centime. The address of La Commission d'indemnisation des victimes de spoliations, which will hear claims, is 66 rue de Bellechasse, 75007 Paris.",

Many others are believed to have died, but it was impossible to accurately count their charred remains.</p> <p>Some 395 bodies, mainly of women and children, were later found in the compounds of three buildings run by the cult. Police believe that there are more dead, but have yet to resume their search because of lack of funds and equipment.</p> <p>According to the documents, Mr Kamm held four meetings at the Kampala police mess between October 6 and 10, 1989 - when reports of manifestations of the Virgin Mary, an aspect common to both cults, were becoming frequent throughout Uganda and neighbouring Rwanda. Mrs Kibwetere said she had been in contact with Mr Kamm before she and her husband went to hear him talk. \"We were interested in visions of His Blessed Mother... Little Pebble sent us these papers and I used to write to him.

But it doesn't mean that it was necessarily William who made the group go off,\" said Wally Anglesea, who is based in Australia and has been monitoring the Little Pebble cult for the past 16 years. The activities of the cult, he said, had caused serious concern in Australia. His sister-in-law had been a member during the 1980s. \"Yes, they are dangerous. Categorically, yes. The reason they are dangerous is the combination of weapons and paranoia and apocalypticism. It's a dangerous cocktail.\"</p> <p>The documents found in the Kibwetere house are a mixture of dispatches from Little Pebble's Australian headquarters and apparently verbatim transcripts of the talks Mrs Kibwetere says he gave in Uganda. They also include a prayer for satanic exorcism.</p> <p>The papers suggest that Mr Kamm was accompanied by a J Duff. According to Mr Anglesea, a James Duffy is head of security of the Little Pebble group, and also acts as the leader's bodyguard. A Ugandan, known only as Mr Iga, introduced the visitors. In a meeting on October 6 1989, Mr Kamm reportedly urged those attending - described in the documents as \"the congregation\" - to \"not be surprised that the church in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania or any other place is speaking against apparitions\". He then called for those present to \"join with Little Pebble of Australia\". There are clear similarities between the Little Pebble and the Kanungu cults, apart from their claims of direct contact with the Virgin Mary (both refer to receiv ing these messages via a \"voice box\"). The symbol of the Ark is prominent in each of the cults. The followers of the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God called the church they entered before burning to death their \"Ark\". They also told friends and relatives that the Virgin Mary was coming to take them to heaven - also promised to Little Pebble's followers on their leader's website.</p> <p><b> Papal aspiration</b><br> Mr Kamm founded his organisation - sometimes also referred to as Our Lady of the Ark and the Order of St Charbel - between 1970-72. He claims to be in contact with the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ as well as other heavenly beings, from whom he says he receives a constant stream of prophetic messages. These are in a similar format to those purportedly received by Kibwetere and the five other leaders of the Ugandan cult.</p> <p>Born in Cologne, Germany, Mr Kamm changed his name to Little Pebble in the early 1980s, perhaps in reference to the biblical St Peter, the Rock. He has for many years been in conflict with the established Catholic church in his local diocese of Wollongong and with the archdiocese of Melbourne. Among his many claims - on his website and in the Ugandan documents - are that he will be the next pope, and he claims that when he met Pope John Paul II, the pontiff confirmed it.</p> <p>The Little Pebble website does show pictures of Mr Kamm meeting the Pope. But on July 17 1985, Archbishop Barbarito, the Pope's representative in Australia, sent the following message to Bishop Murray of Wollongong, who had already declared Kamm's movement inauthentic. The message, directly from Archbishop Edward Martin, then the Pope's chief secretary, read: \"I ask you to inform Bishop Murray that though... Mr Kamm met the Holy Father... and took part with others of the faithful at the Mass in the Holy Father's private chapel, nevertheless he did not receive any approval of his alleged 'visions' on the part of the Holy Father.\"</p> <p>In 1997, George Pell, Archbishop of Melbourne, issued a statement in which he made it clear that Little Pebble did not have the approval of the archdiocese.</p> <p>The archbishop's statement ran: \"Messages are alleged to have been received from this person in which great emphasis is placed on millennialism, warnings, signs, torments, days of darkness.

The anger of Polish farmers boiled over last year, when the militant agricultural workers' union Samoobrona (Self- Defence) staged countrywide protests against the flood of cheap EU imports. This persuaded Warsaw to temporarily ban grain imports and raise the amounts paid for home-grown pork. But the moves were not enough to satisfy Samoobrona's leader, Andrej Lepper, who will run as a candidate in the presidential election this autumn. \"Poland is not being treated as a partner by the EU. We are simply being used as a dumping ground for their surplus products,\" he said. Two-thirds of large farm owners recently declared their readiness to take part in further militant protests.",

The opposition party is giving Zanu-PF its strongest challenge since it came to power at the country's independence in 1980 and this appears to have prompted the violence. The weekend killing of a white farmer, David Stevens, is considered part of the wave of political violence, as Mr Stevens was an MDC supporter, which infuriated the local Zanu-PF supporters. Far from urging his supporters to refrain from violence, Mr Mugabe on Sunday told members of his party to \"hit out fiercely\" against the opposition. However, Mr Mugabe expressed regret about the killing of Mr Stevens yesterday when he met privately with representatives of the country's 4,200 white farmers. The president of the Commercial Farmers' Union, Tim Henwood, said Mr Mugabe wanted to get Zimbabwe \"back to normal\", but Mr Mugabe said he would not order squatters off white-owned farms.

      "byline": "Hugo Young",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When Tony Blair met Vladimir Putin yesterday, he said he would raise the subject of Moscow's atrocities in Chechnya. There's no reason to doubt that he did so, but equally no reason to suppose he had the slightest effect. He blew his powder at their first meeting in St Petersburg. In the full read-out of that wide-ranging conversation which London immediately supplied to Washington, what most struck the Americans was Putin's unyielding severity on Chechnya. It was harsher than they expected. The Russian replied to Blair's expressions of disapproval with brutal indifference.</p> <p>This gives Mr Blair's protestations about his meeting yesterday an aura of empty piety. The words will have been spoken, but then the leaders moved on to other business. No doubt this was done with civility. Mr Putin studies his interlocutors with the care of a trained agent to touch the right buttons. When he first met Madeleine Albright, he broke the ice by talking about Munich. To the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, he dwelt on Europe. James Wolfensohn, head of the World Bank, was favoured with a humouring of his love of classical music. So one may be sure the Third Way was batted between interpreters at the Downing Street lunch.</p> <p>For that is what Mr Blair likes to talk about, irrespective of who is listening. Dialogue, in all and any circumstances, has become the hallmark of his foreign policy. Far from being a leader especially confined within the limits of what is supposed to be \"ethical\", he is ruthlessly dismissive of such fine points of propriety. Moral protest, such as Putin generated in Whitehall and elsewhere, will cut no ice. This contrast between the theory and practice of Blair presents a startling spectacle.</p> <p>He's a fervent believer in his powers of persuasion. That's how he has conducted his European policy for three years. He's entranced by talk, and the spirit of this, after Britain's years of silence and/or aggression in EU councils and committees, is reciprocated. There's hardly a leader in the Union with whom he is not best friends, a trait which, a Foreign Office man once told me, had, in the innocent beginning, problems as well as virtues. Such was the pleasure and admiration Blair's early meetings produced that he would return from Europe convinced he had surmounted all the tiresome old problems. Everyone, it seemed, agreed with him. His success in dialogue made, perhaps makes, him believe that anything is possible.</p> <p>He can't seriously imagine Chechnya is amenable to the same treatment. But the education of Mr Putin to the meaning of economic reform is more plausible. Engagement, for Blair, turns out to be in all circumstances preferable to ostracism. The concrete gains for Britain may be hard to detect. The suggestion that British business might get a head-start in the reformed Russian economy is as dubious in its premise as its conclusion: the economy has yet to be reformed, and business's success or failure against German and American competitors has never had much to do with sweet-talking politicians.</p> <p>But for Britain to be first into Putin's Moscow is the kind of vacuous coup diplomats dream of. It also plays to the leader's ambition to be out in front. With the Queen enlisted to give tea to the butcher of Chechnya, we learn how far Mr Blair will go to establish priorities that are quite different from those with which he apparently began.</p> <p>Under any other leader, this would be striking enough. Moscow is in breach of elementary international protocols. Putin contemptuously humiliated the UN human rights commissioner, Mary Robinson, refusing to acknowledge that she had any locus in Chechnya. The Council of Europe, to which Russia was admitted in hope of tying Russian freedoms to the standards of an international charter, takes such a serious view of the Chechnyan brutalities that her membership may soon be suspended.</p> <p>Ignoring these signals, riding rough over their implications, could not normally be done with impunity. Even a morally uncluttered head of government - Chirac, say, or even Clinton - would experience embarrassment trying to clarify why he was prepared to welcome the leader who had so affronted international opinion. For Putin, let's be clear, is the winner here. Putative British contracts, or special Blairite third-way instruction, count for little beside the royal respectability the new Russian has been accorded without making a single concession to the legal order his country signed up to. This is what, by the canons of proper behaviour, needs to be explained away.</p> <p>Blair, however, has another problem as well. He was going to be a different sort of leader, standing for something new in the grammar of foreign policy, an ethical dimension. He raised expectations. These have been betrayed many times over. Whether in Sierra Leone or Iraq or Indonesia, they look like a sick joke. The phrase, in fact, can now be seen as the most foolish platform from which any new government has ever launched itself into the international arena. But it stands in the record. It has not been glossed, still less repudiated, by ministers. It remains in the mind, as the benchmark by which these ministers said they would be judged.</p> <p>This is what makes the Blair-Putin alliance so arresting. Having once talked about ethics, which neither Margaret Thatcher nor John Major ever did, Blair shows how irrelevant they are. He is wholly pragmatic, ruthlessly focused, hard-as-nails committed to the supreme relevance of his own persuasive role. The outrage expressed by many sincere people against this premature welcoming of Putin into the embrace of the western powers meets Blair's own passionate unconcern.</p> <p>There is a case for getting on with Putin. He looks likely to be in power for some time. He may have a mandate for reform which brings legal order to a chaotic economic regime. Under him, Russia will be engaged in reassembling its presence on the world scene. By coming to London, he opens himself to western influence. On nuclear disarmament, he has an inescapable role. Britain, in this respect, has taken the chance to play her part as a proxy for Washington, which will even now have gobbled up a complete transcript of the London conversations.</p> <p>What's more compelling is the ease with which Blair dumped his pretensions in order to achieve this. The case for sticks not carrots, against the perpetrator of Chechnyan barbarities, goes unheard, just as it did with Jiang Zemin, and might, in the right circumstances, with Saddam Hussein. Instead we get a lot of stuff about men of the same generation who are able to understand each other. New men. New bonds. Special chemistry. This has its possibilities. But ethics? Schmethics. A hard man is sucking up to a harder one, as Bismarck might have said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Tony Blair met Vladimir Putin yesterday, he said he would raise the subject of Moscow's atrocities in Chechnya. There's no reason to doubt that he did so, but equally no reason to suppose he had the slightest effect. He blew his powder at their first meeting in St Petersburg. In the full read-out of that wide-ranging conversation which London immediately supplied to Washington, what most struck the Americans was Putin's unyielding severity on Chechnya. It was harsher than they expected. The Russian replied to Blair's expressions of disapproval with brutal indifference. This gives Mr Blair's protestations about his meeting yesterday an aura of empty piety. The words will have been spoken, but then the leaders moved on to other business. No doubt this was done with civility. Mr Putin studies his interlocutors with the care of a trained agent to touch the right buttons. When he first met Madeleine Albright, he broke the ice by talking about Munich. To the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, he dwelt on Europe. James Wolfensohn, head of the World Bank, was favoured with a humouring of his love of classical music. So one may be sure the Third Way was batted between interpreters at the Downing Street lunch. For that is what Mr Blair likes to talk about, irrespective of who is listening. Dialogue, in all and any circumstances, has become the hallmark of his foreign policy. Far from being a leader especially confined within the limits of what is supposed to be \"ethical\", he is ruthlessly dismissive of such fine points of propriety. Moral protest, such as Putin generated in Whitehall and elsewhere, will cut no ice. This contrast between the theory and practice of Blair presents a startling spectacle. He's a fervent believer in his powers of persuasion. That's how he has conducted his European policy for three years. He's entranced by talk, and the spirit of this, after Britain's years of silence and/or aggression in EU councils and committees, is reciprocated. There's hardly a leader in the Union with whom he is not best friends, a trait which, a Foreign Office man once told me, had, in the innocent beginning, problems as well as virtues. Such was the pleasure and admiration Blair's early meetings produced that he would return from Europe convinced he had surmounted all the tiresome old problems. Everyone, it seemed, agreed with him. His success in dialogue made, perhaps makes, him believe that anything is possible. He can't seriously imagine Chechnya is amenable to the same treatment. But the education of Mr Putin to the meaning of economic reform is more plausible. Engagement, for Blair, turns out to be in all circumstances preferable to ostracism. The concrete gains for Britain may be hard to detect. The suggestion that British business might get a head-start in the reformed Russian economy is as dubious in its premise as its conclusion: the economy has yet to be reformed, and business's success or failure against German and American competitors has never had much to do with sweet-talking politicians. But for Britain to be first into Putin's Moscow is the kind of vacuous coup diplomats dream of. It also plays to the leader's ambition to be out in front. With the Queen enlisted to give tea to the butcher of Chechnya, we learn how far Mr Blair will go to establish priorities that are quite different from those with which he apparently began. Under any other leader, this would be striking enough. Moscow is in breach of elementary international protocols. Putin contemptuously humiliated the UN human rights commissioner, Mary Robinson, refusing to acknowledge that she had any locus in Chechnya. The Council of Europe, to which Russia was admitted in hope of tying Russian freedoms to the standards of an international charter, takes such a serious view of the Chechnyan brutalities that her membership may soon be suspended. Ignoring these signals, riding rough over their implications, could not normally be done with impunity. Even a morally uncluttered head of government - Chirac, say, or even Clinton - would experience embarrassment trying to clarify why he was prepared to welcome the leader who had so affronted international opinion. For Putin, let's be clear, is the winner here. Putative British contracts, or special Blairite third-way instruction, count for little beside the royal respectability the new Russian has been accorded without making a single concession to the legal order his country signed up to. This is what, by the canons of proper behaviour, needs to be explained away. Blair, however, has another problem as well. He was going to be a different sort of leader, standing for something new in the grammar of foreign policy, an ethical dimension. He raised expectations. These have been betrayed many times over. Whether in Sierra Leone or Iraq or Indonesia, they look like a sick joke. The phrase, in fact, can now be seen as the most foolish platform from which any new government has ever launched itself into the international arena. But it stands in the record. It has not been glossed, still less repudiated, by ministers. It remains in the mind, as the benchmark by which these ministers said they would be judged. This is what makes the Blair-Putin alliance so arresting. Having once talked about ethics, which neither Margaret Thatcher nor John Major ever did, Blair shows how irrelevant they are. He is wholly pragmatic, ruthlessly focused, hard-as-nails committed to the supreme relevance of his own persuasive role. The outrage expressed by many sincere people against this premature welcoming of Putin into the embrace of the western powers meets Blair's own passionate unconcern. There is a case for getting on with Putin. He looks likely to be in power for some time. He may have a mandate for reform which brings legal order to a chaotic economic regime. Under him, Russia will be engaged in reassembling its presence on the world scene. By coming to London, he opens himself to western influence. On nuclear disarmament, he has an inescapable role. Britain, in this respect, has taken the chance to play her part as a proxy for Washington, which will even now have gobbled up a complete transcript of the London conversations. What's more compelling is the ease with which Blair dumped his pretensions in order to achieve this. The case for sticks not carrots, against the perpetrator of Chechnyan barbarities, goes unheard, just as it did with Jiang Zemin, and might, in the right circumstances, with Saddam Hussein. Instead we get a lot of stuff about men of the same generation who are able to understand each other. New men. New bonds. Special chemistry. This has its possibilities. But ethics? Schmethics. A hard man is sucking up to a harder one, as Bismarck might have said.",

The remains belong to suspects who were tortured to death under military rule, from 1976 to 1983. Forensic experts found the marks of a bullet delivered at close range on all the corpses, which were buried in December 1976, at the height of state repression. The cemetery's administrator, Juan Hrchan, was warned by his predecessor in the job to leave the anonymous tombs alone, as \"subversives\" were buried there. He has received death threats since announcing the find and has been forced to move his family to a safer home. The discovery rekindled hopes among relatives of the disappeared that they might still find the final resting place of their loved ones; an estimated 30,000 citizens were kidnapped and killed in 320 death camps across the country during the regime. After the discovery, local government officials explained how they received frequent calls for burial space from army commanders based in the infamous Pozo de Banfield, located five streets away, where hundreds of suspects were tortured to death. \"It's one more small but positive step,\" said Laura Bonaparte, a spokeswoman for the Mothers of the Disappeared, the first group to protest against the disappearances.",

      "body": "<p>Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools, was accused yesterday of contributing to the suicide of a primary teacher by allowing Ofsted inspectors to put too much pressure on staff during routine classroom visits.</p> <p>An emergency motion was tabled at the start of the annual conference of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in Belfast regretting the death of Pamela Relf \"as a result of Ofsted-induced stress\". Miss Relf, 57, committed suicide in January by jumping into a freezing river.</p> <p>An inquest heard that she had been depressed for some time, but broke down in tears after criticism from inspectors during their visit to Middlefield primary school in Eynesbury, Cambridgeshire. In a handwritten note, she said: \"I am now finding the stress of my job too much. The pace of work and the long days are more than I can do.\"</p> <p>The association's emergency motion said the case was \"the tip of the iceberg as far as Ofsted's harm to teachers is concerned\". It called for urgent research into \"the victims of Ofsted\".</p> <p>Peter Smith, the association's general secretary, said he did not blame Ofsted for causing Miss Relf's death, but the visit from the inspectors may have triggered it. \"She had a history of depressive illness. If Ofsted was responsible for the last straw, that doesn't mean it was responsible for the entire haystack,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Smith released copies of correspondence with Mr Woodhead, saying it showed the chief inspector was \"off-hand, gratuitously offensive and insensitive\" in his comments on the case.</p> <p>On March 1, Mr Smith wrote criticising Ofsted for showing no sympathy to Miss Relf's family, or regret about the death of the teacher. By return of post, Mr Woodhead said his press officer had already expressed Ofsted's sadness, but this had gone unreported. \"Why don't once in a while you stop and think before you put pen to paper?\" he told the veteran union leader.</p> <p>Mr Smith wrote back explaining that he was not accusing Mr Woodhead of causing the suicide and enclosing the address of Miss Relf's brother so that the chief inspector could send his condolences. After a follow-up letter from the association's leader on March 14, Mr Woodhead said he had decided to let the correspondence drop.

      "bodyText": "Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools, was accused yesterday of contributing to the suicide of a primary teacher by allowing Ofsted inspectors to put too much pressure on staff during routine classroom visits. An emergency motion was tabled at the start of the annual conference of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in Belfast regretting the death of Pamela Relf \"as a result of Ofsted-induced stress\". Miss Relf, 57, committed suicide in January by jumping into a freezing river. An inquest heard that she had been depressed for some time, but broke down in tears after criticism from inspectors during their visit to Middlefield primary school in Eynesbury, Cambridgeshire. In a handwritten note, she said: \"I am now finding the stress of my job too much. The pace of work and the long days are more than I can do.\" The association's emergency motion said the case was \"the tip of the iceberg as far as Ofsted's harm to teachers is concerned\". It called for urgent research into \"the victims of Ofsted\". Peter Smith, the association's general secretary, said he did not blame Ofsted for causing Miss Relf's death, but the visit from the inspectors may have triggered it. \"She had a history of depressive illness. If Ofsted was responsible for the last straw, that doesn't mean it was responsible for the entire haystack,\" he said. Mr Smith released copies of correspondence with Mr Woodhead, saying it showed the chief inspector was \"off-hand, gratuitously offensive and insensitive\" in his comments on the case. On March 1, Mr Smith wrote criticising Ofsted for showing no sympathy to Miss Relf's family, or regret about the death of the teacher. By return of post, Mr Woodhead said his press officer had already expressed Ofsted's sadness, but this had gone unreported. \"Why don't once in a while you stop and think before you put pen to paper?\" he told the veteran union leader. Mr Smith wrote back explaining that he was not accusing Mr Woodhead of causing the suicide and enclosing the address of Miss Relf's brother so that the chief inspector could send his condolences. After a follow-up letter from the association's leader on March 14, Mr Woodhead said he had decided to let the correspondence drop. The chief inspector enclosed a copy of a letter that he wrote, but did not send, on March 6, casting doubt on Mr Smith's \"unwarranted and patronising assumption of moral superiority\" and rejecting the suggestion that Ofsted should write to Miss Relf's brother. Mr Smith said last night: \"My advice to Mr Woodhead is never to put on paper anything he would not be happy to show for publication.\" In a statement on the association's motion, Ofsted said it had consistently expressed sadness and sympathy about Miss Relf's death. \"We too are human beings and recognise the human tragedy of her suicide.\" Whatever part the inspection played in adding to Miss Relf's depression, Ofsted \"always recognised that inspection can be a stressful event\". Over recent years the inspe ction rules had been changed to reduce that stress as much as possible. It was unclear how the conference will handle the emergency motion. Mr Smith said the wording was too strong because it could not be shown that the behaviour of inspectors caused Miss Relf's death. But the conference is likely to want to register its distaste for Ofsted-induced stress.",

By Tanzanian standards, the people of Manzese are lucky. </p> <p>The clinic is well stocked with drugs supplied by the Swiss government. In many rural areas dispensaries run out well before the year is over. </p> <p>Tanzania's finance minister, Daniel Yona, could have been forgiven for failing to raise a cheer last week, when he heard that his country had finally completed the lengthy process of qualifying for the official debt relief scheme for the world's poorest nations. </p> <p>Twenty years after the country first asked its first world creditors for help with its mounting foreign debt, Tanzania has had the annual interest bill on its loans mountain cut - by around $12m a year, or just 7%. </p> <p>This will leave the country still spending $3m a week servicing debt, twice what it spends on healthcare. </p> <p>Six years ago, Tanzania was named on a list of the world's 40 most heavily indebted countries. After years of foot dragging, a British-led campaign succeeded in persuading the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund that some of these countries were never going to be able to pay back what they had borrowed. </p> <p>The bank and the fund responded by offering debt relief under strictly limited conditions. Countries which stuck to a six-year programme of economic reform laid down by the fund would qualify to have their debts reduced to \"sustainable\" levels under the heavily indebted poor countries initiative (HIPC). </p> <p>But the measure of sustainability chosen by the Washington number crunchers was whether the country was financially able to service all its debt, not whether the money being siphoned off by western creditors might be better put to use elsewhere in the country. </p> <p>Last year, three years into the debt-relief programme, only one country, Uganda, had had its loans burdens cut. </p> <p>After a global lobbying campaign, the creditor nations promised a speedier and more generous programme. In return countries have promised to spend the proceeds of debt relief on poverty reduction. </p> <p>Tanzania is among the first to qualify under the West's new-look debt relief effort; its case highlights many of the shortcomings of the new deal. By the fund's standards, Tanzania is one of its better performers. </p> <p>After years of double-digit price rises, its inflation target of 5% is almost in reach, the government deficit is just 1.4% of GDP and growth this year is predicted to be around 4%. </p> <p>But 10 years of tough economic reform has not translated into improvements in the everyday lives of the average Tanzanian. </p> <p>School enrolment ratios are lower than they were in 1990, the country has the world's lowest transi tion rate from primary to secondary school and malnutrition among the under-fives is on the increase. </p> <p>Fifty per cent of the population lives on less than a $1 a day and at current growth rates it will take 40 years to cut by half the numbers living in absolute poverty. </p> <p>Despite the promise that the rewards of debt relief would be spent tackling these problems, local debt campaigners worry that hopes are being raised over what is actually a small sum of money. </p> <p>\"If you do the calculations, the amount of money released for poverty reduction is actually not very much,\" says Christopher Mwakasege, from Tanzanian Social and Economic Trust. </p> <p>There are still more hurdles to jump over before Tanzania receives the full debt relief promised. It must complete a poverty reduction strategy paper to convince the bank and the fund that the money will be well spent. </p> <p>Concerns are mounting that HIPC mark 2 is starting to look awfully like a re-run with all the flaws of the programme it replaced. </p> <p>It had been hoped to have 10 or 11 countries into the programme by the time of the IMF-World Bank spring meetings and at least 25 by the end of the year. In the event, only four countries have so far embarked on the process. </p> <p>Although the chancellor, Gordon Brown, welcomed the creation of an IMF-World Bank implementation group, which the UK had proposed as a way of slicing through Washington red tape, debt campaigners fear there is a danger of losing momentum. </p> <p>They say no country has actually received any additional debt relief since G7 leaders pledged in Cologne last June to slash the debt burden of the world's poorest countries by $100bn. </p> <p>Back in Dar es Salaam, the deputy head of the finance ministry, Gray Mgonja, is able to be a little more direct than his boss about what Tanzania would actually like from the West. \"We want 100% cancellation,\" he says.</p>",

Twenty years after the country first asked its first world creditors for help with its mounting foreign debt, Tanzania has had the annual interest bill on its loans mountain cut - by around $12m a year, or just 7%. This will leave the country still spending $3m a week servicing debt, twice what it spends on healthcare. Six years ago, Tanzania was named on a list of the world's 40 most heavily indebted countries. After years of foot dragging, a British-led campaign succeeded in persuading the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund that some of these countries were never going to be able to pay back what they had borrowed. The bank and the fund responded by offering debt relief under strictly limited conditions. Countries which stuck to a six-year programme of economic reform laid down by the fund would qualify to have their debts reduced to \"sustainable\" levels under the heavily indebted poor countries initiative (HIPC). But the measure of sustainability chosen by the Washington number crunchers was whether the country was financially able to service all its debt, not whether the money being siphoned off by western creditors might be better put to use elsewhere in the country. Last year, three years into the debt-relief programme, only one country, Uganda, had had its loans burdens cut. After a global lobbying campaign, the creditor nations promised a speedier and more generous programme. In return countries have promised to spend the proceeds of debt relief on poverty reduction. Tanzania is among the first to qualify under the West's new-look debt relief effort; its case highlights many of the shortcomings of the new deal. By the fund's standards, Tanzania is one of its better performers. After years of double-digit price rises, its inflation target of 5% is almost in reach, the government deficit is just 1.4% of GDP and growth this year is predicted to be around 4%. But 10 years of tough economic reform has not translated into improvements in the everyday lives of the average Tanzanian. School enrolment ratios are lower than they were in 1990, the country has the world's lowest transi tion rate from primary to secondary school and malnutrition among the under-fives is on the increase. Fifty per cent of the population lives on less than a $1 a day and at current growth rates it will take 40 years to cut by half the numbers living in absolute poverty. Despite the promise that the rewards of debt relief would be spent tackling these problems, local debt campaigners worry that hopes are being raised over what is actually a small sum of money. \"If you do the calculations, the amount of money released for poverty reduction is actually not very much,\" says Christopher Mwakasege, from Tanzanian Social and Economic Trust. There are still more hurdles to jump over before Tanzania receives the full debt relief promised. It must complete a poverty reduction strategy paper to convince the bank and the fund that the money will be well spent. Concerns are mounting that HIPC mark 2 is starting to look awfully like a re-run with all the flaws of the programme it replaced. It had been hoped to have 10 or 11 countries into the programme by the time of the IMF-World Bank spring meetings and at least 25 by the end of the year. In the event, only four countries have so far embarked on the process. Although the chancellor, Gordon Brown, welcomed the creation of an IMF-World Bank implementation group, which the UK had proposed as a way of slicing through Washington red tape, debt campaigners fear there is a danger of losing momentum. They say no country has actually received any additional debt relief since G7 leaders pledged in Cologne last June to slash the debt burden of the world's poorest countries by $100bn. Back in Dar es Salaam, the deputy head of the finance ministry, Gray Mgonja, is able to be a little more direct than his boss about what Tanzania would actually like from the West. \"We want 100% cancellation,\" he says.",

Deborah Price, 25, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, who is now a researcher on Cilla Black's Blind Date show, also received a public apology over an article in the Mirror newspaper in February last year concerning the show presented by Vanessa Feltz. Ms Price's solicitor, David Price, told Mr Justice Eady that the article \"disclosed that several guests who had appeared on the show purporting to relate true-life stories were in fact fakes who had invented the accounts which they presented to viewers\". One show featured a woman who said she wanted a divorce when she was not married, he said. \"Another concerned two women who claimed they were sisters but were in fact unrelated.\" Ms Price had arranged for the guests to appear on the show, he said. \"The article went on to allege that not only were the guests fakes, but also that Ms Price had known that they were fakes and had thereby deliberately deceived her employers and the viewers.\" But Ms Price neither knew nor suspected that any of the guests were fakes. She took reasonable steps to verify their authenticity, \"bearing in mind the time constraints imposed on her by her employers, the BBC\", Mr Price said. \"The three fake guests all admitted that they had sought to deceive Ms Price into believing they were genuine, and stated that they had no reason to believe that Ms Price was aware that they were fakes.\" She was \"devastated\" by the article.

      "bodyText": "City institutions are likely to face big underwriting bills to bail out corporate fundraisings, which have slipped under water due to plunging share prices. Among the largest cash calls underway is a \u00a350m open offer of shares by Sanctuary, the entertainment group. Sanctuary wants the money to buy a rival publisher, Castle Music, and is offering new shares at 73p. Sanctuary's share price yesterday slumped 8p to 58p, however, making the issue look distinctly unattractive. Stockbroker Investec Henderson Crosthwaite is underwriting the offer. Director Simon Grafftey-Smith said: \"This is just down to general market sentiment - it's nothing to do with Sanctuary's prospects specifically.\" He said Investec would only pick up a modest proportion of the shares, as it has signed up other institutions as sub-underwriters to take the rest. Euro Sales Finance, a moneylender which provides bridging loans to businesses, is also raising \u00a350m. Its shares fell 80p to \u00a313.75 yesterday, against an issue price of \u00a314.75. The lead underwriter is Deutsche Bank, with other institutions acting as sub-underwriters. Even Richard Branson's unquoted Virgin Group could be hit. Its personal products spin-off, Victory Corporation, is attempting to raise \u00a39.7m to expand its cosmetics range. The shares closed yesterday at 3p, against an open offer of 5p.",

Rules are to be introduced by the end of the year to avert the threat of an EU ban on Britain's \u00a3226m export trade in sheep meat and live animals. The Ministry of Agriculture said the new tracing system for up to 40m sheep and 77,000 goats would also have benefits for the control of diseases, including BSE should it ever be found to have transferred from cattle to sheep. Officials said they were keeping the extra burden to hard-pressed farmers to a minimum, with the cost of tags put at \u00a312m the first year and \u00a36m annually after that. In a consultation document, they made no attempt to quantify additional labour costs on Britain's 80,000 sheep farms but the system will not be as detailed or complicated as that already required for 11m cattle following the BSE fiasco. Tags will cost an average 55p a sheep but with lambs selling at market for an average \u00a345, the additional costs will have less impact than might have been feared in recent years. Tagging should have been introduced under EU rules in 1995 but it was only at end of last year that Brussels warned of possible legal action against Britain.

The Earl of Harewood, president of Leeds United, led an official party from the club, which Mr Speight, 40, had followed for more than two decades. Leeds goalkeeper Nigel Martyn and club manager David O'Leary were among the mourners. Scooter and ice hockey pictures had to take second place to portraits and mementoes of the Premier League side on the walls of his Bay Horse pub in Farsley's main street.

Mr Speight, who leaves a son, George, seven and a daughter, Holly, two, died of multiple stab wounds after a gang of Turkish youths ran riot in central Istanbul on April 5. Christopher Loftus, 35, the second victim of the incident on the night before Leeds United's Uefa Cup semi-final against Turkey's champion club, Galatasaray, will be buried today at Leeds parish church. Four Turkish men have been charged with the murders, which have led to exceptionally tight security and a ban on Galatasaray fans for the second leg of the Cup tie on Thursday night in Leeds. Turkey's interior minister announced yesterday that a squad of 11 police would accompany the Istanbul team to West Yorkshire, with 80 VIP ticketholders whose bona fides have been passed by Uefa.",

      "bodyText": "After four years and \u00a34m, it took only seconds to smash Pete Goss's dream of taking his revolutionary giant catamaran to the greatest ever round the world race . Yesterday he revealed that it would take more than three months and several hundred thousand pounds to repair his state of the art craft, after a 40ft section of the port bow snapped off into the sea during trials three weeks ago. The disaster appeared to end Mr Goss's hopes of competing in the ultimate sailing challenge. If the radical new design could not cope with the relatively calm waters off the Isles of Scilly, how could it ever cope with the 40ft waves of the southern oceans? But the 62-strong team of designers and builders behind Team Philips have pinpointed the problem. Contrary to what their many critics had claimed, it did not lie in any fundamental design flaw and they insist the problem can be fixed in time for the catamaran to reach Barcelona for the start of The Race, as it is known, the French organised non-stop circumnavigation of the globe due to start on the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve. Now, three weeks after disaster struck the world's largest carbon fibre structure the prognosis looks good. The enormous catamaran - it measures 120ft by 70ft with enough space to park 80 cars between its hulls and is capable of 40 knots - was moved upstream from Dartmouth last week to its boatyard in the Devonshire town of Totnes to allow the team to get back to work if not, as many thought, back to the drawing board. Mr Goss, the man behind the dream, has remained sanguine, displaying the kind of temperament which must come in handy for a man who has sailed around the world twice and crossed the Atlantic three times. Despite having to pull out of the upcoming Jules Verne Trophy, he has insisted all along that the problem was nothing to worry about. \"It will take three or four months to fix the problem and something in the region of a couple of hundred thousand pounds. But there's always a price to pay with anything like this and right now the greatest price is time. \"Two things can happen when this kind of thing takes place: either it can all fall apart or everybody pulls together. We chose to work at the cutting edge of innovation and difficulties are inherent in that. \"Projects like this don't come wrapped in clingfilm on a supermarket shelf. But the whole aim was to win The Race and that hasn't changed.\" The team of designers, led by Adrian Thompson, who conceived the revolutionary idea of a giant catamaran using wave piercing hulls with no supporting cross beams, hope to complete a detailed survey of the vessel by Friday. What is already certain is that a change in the structural make-up of both hulls will be necessary to deal with the problem of side forces, which act like giant levers trying to snap the extended bows off. The failure which led to the bow breaking off and a 15ft crack appearing in the star board hull lay in the bonding of a main carbon fibre \"plank\" which runs fore and aft on both sides of the hull and the hi-tech honeycomb core between the two skins of the hull. This single plant of fibres requires perfect bonding with epoxy resin to the core, and when the laminate was curing in its mould, the heat generated caused air in the honeycomb to expand and corrupt the bond. The remedy will include a series of frames and stringers to provide additional support, as well as the considerable rein forcement of the broken plank structures. While work continues on the hulls, Mr Goss and his five crew members have continued their training, using one of the two 135ft masts, which has been set in concrete near the Goss headquarters. The sponsors, led by electronics giant Philips, are clearly happy to continue to fund the adventure, and it is easy to see why. With 500,000 visitors to the boatyard at Baltic Wharf in Totnes and 4m hits on the website since the project began, the catamaran - and the searing hole in its blue and silver hull - has become an even bigger crowd-puller since the latest setback, with letters of support arriving by the sackload every day. It is not only the boat which is enjoying celebrity status. Mr Goss, who is married with three children, was already a household name in France after the former Royal Marine turned back in treacherous winds in the Southern Ocean during the Vend\u00e9e Globe single-handed sailing challenge to rescue French yachtsman Raphel Dinelli, a feat for which he received the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, France's highest gallantry award. Although he also received an MBE in Britain, the fresh hordes of British autograph hunters have only served to boost the Team Philips crew. Mr Goss said: \"There's no doubt in my mind that we'll be there at the start of The Race on December 31. We can fix it, I have absolute confidence in that. \"People said it would never work and I suppose some of them will never be convinced until the boat crosses the finishing line.\"",

Grampian's chief constable, Andrew Brown, said: \"It is clear from the report that the distress experienced by Alan and Julie at their tragic loss was considerably exacerbated by the failure to find Jack during the initial search. The force deeply regrets the additional distress and has apologised unreservedly.\" Mr Brown said recommendations in the report, produced by a Tayside police team, included advice to individual officers.",

The change, which will see the main stock market listing move to Switzerland, is intended to make it easier for the parent company, Zurich Financial Services, to complete mergers and acquisitions and appease US investors ahead of its planned stock market listing there. To compensate British investors for its removal from the London index, holders of Allied Zurich shares will receive a special cash dividend of 40p a share. The shares will no longer be eligible for inclusion in the FTSE 100 because of the decision to take the primary stock market listing to Zurich, although a secondary listing will be maintained in London. The new structure - approved by three of Allied Zurich's major institutional shareholders - follows a prolonged period of confusion about the share movement of the two companies forming Zurich Financial Services, which was created when the Swiss-based company bought the financial services arm of British American Tobacco two years ago. Under the terms of the merger, Zurich Financial Services was formed and owned 57% by Swiss investors through Zurich Allied and 43% by Allied Zurich. The London shares have been trading at a discount to those in Switzerland. Lord Cairns, chairman of Allied Zurich in London, will retire after the unification.",

His father, a local education ministry official insists that his son was at home.</p> <p>The activists are all well-known. \"The guy who was the watchman in the Hajjarian shootings lives two doors from here,\" said Mehdi, a computer shop owner who declined to give his last name.</p> <p>\"He is a very religious person and the activities of this gang are carried out for ideological reasons - the police are terrified of them.\"</p> <p>Mahmoud Kaveh, who owns a nearby video store, was shot shortly before the attack on Mr Hajjarian.</p> <p>He had earlier received several written threats, one of which read: \"In the name of the Almighty, dear Mr Kaveh, immediately remove the name 'video' from your shop.\" The letter was signed, \"Hizbullah,\" a reference to Iran's most notorious Islamic extremists.</p> <p>Ordinary Rey residents are left trying to stay clear of the extremists' path. \"I have changed my vocation and closed my shop,\" reads a sign on Mr Kaveh's store.</p> <p>Plots to kill or harm those deemed to have violated religious principles are concocted in a religious centre in Rey. Freelance and official clerics preach to hundreds of young men who gather there.</p> <p>This week ceremonies were under way to mark Ashura, the Shi'ite mourning ceremony for the martyred Imam Hossein. A prominent cleric who is close to Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is to preach this weekend at the climax of Ashura.</p> <p>\"Hundreds of motorcycles were on this street last night in front of the heyyat ,\" said a man who runs a kebab stand nearby. The motorcycles are the trademark of the basij . \"But don't go there because they never allow women inside,\" he advised.</p> <p>But fear pervades this city. \"Even if those in jail are executed, it won't make a difference.

One woman was murdered because she was believed to be a prostitute. A video shop owner was shot, but survived. \"Videos are worse than bombs,\" the extremists wrote on the shop walls before the attack. A grenade was thrown into a pizza parlour which was known for allowing boys and girls to mingle together - which is officially illegal but is largely tolerated in Tehran. Emboldened by the sermons from semi-official clerics in their heyyats, or religious societies, the extremists broadened their activities beyond the confines of Rey on March 12. They allegedly shot Saeed Hajjarian, one of the masterminds behind the reformers' victory in February's parliamentary polls. Mr Hajjarian is in hospital in stable condition. \"The extremists are feeling the winds of reform and that's why they have become more aggressive,\" Mr Mehrasebi's son, Mohsen, 25, said. He said his father was targeted for holding meetings of dervishes, Islamic mystics who are often at odds with orthodoxy. \"We have tried for two years to get justice. We wrote a letter to the president and the judiciary, but the authorities ignored us,\" he added. \"We gave our story to the newspapers when the murder happened but it was never printed. Now our story is in the news because a prominent person has been shot by the same gang who killed our father.\" At least eight men, all from Shahr-e Rey, are being held in connection with the plot to kill Mr Hajjarian and are scheduled to go on trial soon. Two are members of a division of the revolutionary guards which protects the government compound in Tehran. One is the son of a cleric who preaches in one of Shahr-e Rey's mosques. The man charged with pulling the trigger, Saeed Asgar, is a member of the basij - the volunteer Islamic militia - which controls this city. His father, a local education ministry official insists that his son was at home. The activists are all well-known. \"The guy who was the watchman in the Hajjarian shootings lives two doors from here,\" said Mehdi, a computer shop owner who declined to give his last name. \"He is a very religious person and the activities of this gang are carried out for ideological reasons - the police are terrified of them.\" Mahmoud Kaveh, who owns a nearby video store, was shot shortly before the attack on Mr Hajjarian. He had earlier received several written threats, one of which read: \"In the name of the Almighty, dear Mr Kaveh, immediately remove the name 'video' from your shop.\" The letter was signed, \"Hizbullah,\" a reference to Iran's most notorious Islamic extremists. Ordinary Rey residents are left trying to stay clear of the extremists' path. \"I have changed my vocation and closed my shop,\" reads a sign on Mr Kaveh's store. Plots to kill or harm those deemed to have violated religious principles are concocted in a religious centre in Rey. Freelance and official clerics preach to hundreds of young men who gather there. This week ceremonies were under way to mark Ashura, the Shi'ite mourning ceremony for the martyred Imam Hossein. A prominent cleric who is close to Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is to preach this weekend at the climax of Ashura. \"Hundreds of motorcycles were on this street last night in front of the heyyat ,\" said a man who runs a kebab stand nearby. The motorcycles are the trademark of the basij . \"But don't go there because they never allow women inside,\" he advised. But fear pervades this city. \"Even if those in jail are executed, it won't make a difference. There is a whole society of militants behind them,\" Mr Mehrasebi said.",

Kent University is to stage a computer-enhanced version of A Midsummer Night's Dream that could change the way plays are performed for ever. Purists may scoff at the very notion of mixing the Bard with technology of the kind used for Lara Croft Tombraider games, but academics claim the virtual reality sets \"are like nothing theatre audiences have ever seen before\". Unlike the special effects and 3D trickery used in the cinema, the virtual scenes being created for Shakespeare are \"alive\" and change every night, just as proper live theatre does, so no performance is the same as the next. Mark Reaney said that by developing a series of cyber worlds not unlike those in which computer games are set, actors and directors can alter the setting on the hoof, opening avenues impossible to explore on film or in conventional theatre. When the first audience files in to see A Midsummer Night's Dream in Canterbury in June, they will be given special 3D glasses through which to watch the changing backdrop projected on to three screens on stage. Professor Reaney said the actors will be free to perform normally because the set will move around them. \"We hope to have technicians sitting in front of the stage so they can react immediately to the actors' movements and take them through all sorts of different generated areas. \"It is all done in real time, it is not like a pre-set video.

Anthony Rowe, design co-ordinator of the Royal Shakespeare Company, said he could see \"huge commercial implications\" for the technology, particularly in big West End musicals. \"Purely on gimmick value alone it would probably be a big hit with audiences.

      "trailText": "<p>He turns furniture into skirts and aeroplane wings into dresses. And now Britain's designer of the year is tipped to take over one of Europe's top fashion houses, Jil Sander.  Laura Craik meets Hussein Chalayan</p>",
      "byline": "Laura Craik",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> 'What do you think it was about?\" Hussein Chalayan, 29, British designer of the year, crown prince of avant-garde fashion, the creative force behind Tse cashmere and prime candidate (if rumours are to be believed) for the chief designer's job at Jil Sander has a habit of deflecting questions back at you. I had asked him to explain the inspiration behind his last show, held at Sadler's Wells Theatre during February's London Fashion Week to huge critical acclaim. </p> <p>Certainly, the show was a display of design genius: razor-sharp tailoring, innovative cutting techniques, stunning sculptural details... but what do I think it was about? Tricky one, that. Since the finale involved models donning sofa covers that turned into dresses and tables that turned into skirts, accompanied by a group of live Bulgarian singers (whose performance was projected through a television screen which formed part of the stage set), I wouldn't like to hazard a guess. </p> <p>\"It was about times of war, when peoples' houses are raided and they're told to leave in five or 10 minutes or they'll get killed. It was the idea of having to evacuate your home,\" says Chalayan, earnestly. \"So the idea was to take a horrific situation like that and contradict it - to represent it in an almost beautiful way. The idea was to hide those possessions that mean a lot to you: hiding the clothes on chairs, turning the chairs into suitcases, and carrying them away. So it's like you've carried your environment with you.\" </p> <p>And to think most designers' inspiration is \"the 80s\". Hussein Chalayan is deeper than that. A clumsy metaphor for his deepness can be found back in 1993, when he buried his degree collection in a friend's back garden, just to see what happened to the fabric. Fresh out of Central Saint Martins, he was awarded a window in the swanky London store Browns for his trouble - just like John Galliano before him. </p> <p>His collection of two seasons ago was based on principles from the Cartesian world view (don't ask); previous shows have included dresses suspended by helium balloons, jackets that lit up with red dots like a flight path and electronically controlled petticoats whose skirts opened out like aeroplane wings coming in to land. </p> <p>In lesser hands, this could be dismissed as pretentious twaddle. For who would wear an aeroplane wing skirt down the pub? In Chalayan's hands, however, it takes fashion for ward. This is fashion as performance art, as something to be marvelled at. </p> <p>As buyers for Liberty, Harrods and Whistles will testify, Chalayan does wearable things, too. They wouldn't be stocking him this season otherwise. Nor would Topshop have commissioned him to design a range for its TS label: the collaboration is now over, but September will see him pep up the rails of an even more mainstream high street store. Marks &amp; Spencer has asked him to design a range for its Autograph collection. See? Creativity and commerce can make happy playfellows. The latter facilitates the former, as Chalayan is well aware. \"All my sponsors have been very nice.\" </p> <p>Ask Chalayan even the simplest question and his brow furrows with a concern borne out of the importance of making himself clear. Who would he like to see as Mayor of London? \"Oh god. Um. Livingstone. I think he should get it. I hope it happens. You never know until things happen... what you think could happen and the consequences of what really happens are unimaginable.\" What book is he reading? \"I'm not reading a book at the moment, I'm reading bits of books. Usually I read theory books, and sometimes they can get so difficult that I don't have the heart to actually start... Maybe I should start reading novels. What are you reading?\" </p> <p>Chalayan lives to work. Most designers do. So painstaking, so relentless is the design process - from inspiration to sketchbook to fabric to dummy to model to catwalk to department store to bank balance - that only those dedicated to the point of obsession have the drive to survive. Chalayan doesn't know how many hours a day he works (\"time just goes\"), but it doesn't leave much time over for anything else. When you engage him in first date-style conversational gambits, his responses are apologetic and vague. Does he cook much? \"Not as much as I would like to.\" Does he have a favourite TV programme? \"I don't really watch TV. It's fun, but when you have time. It's quite sad, because a lot of people might talk about programmes that are on and stuff, and I've kind of missed out. 'Ali G said this, Ali G said that...' I haven't seen Ali G. Bj\u00f6rk was taking the piss out of me the other day for not knowing who Ali G was.\" </p> <p>Chalayan isn't name-dropping when he mentions his friend Bj\u00f6rk, an early champion of his clothes. When he says he doesn't notice which celebrities wear Hussein Chalayan, you believe him. Celebrity is a distraction from fashion: during his acceptance speech at the British Fashion Awards, he made an earnest plea to the press not to value celebrity endorsement over genuine creativity (this after Posh Spice had received blanket coverage for modelling in the mediocre Maria Grachvogel show). \"All the designers just work so hard; they deserved that space more than Posh Spice. Sometimes, this country is all about celebrities and football and pubs. I thought the fashion press might have been able to transcend that, but obviously the papers asked them to report on whatever was apt.\" </p> <p>Chalayan should be used to Britain's obsessions by now: he has lived here since he was 12. But he retains the viewpoint of the detached outsider. The only child of Turkish-Cypriot parents (they divorced when he was five), he was a boarder at Highgate Boys School, north London - an experience he once likened to being in the army. \"It was excruciatingly difficult, but I suppose I tried to channel it positively. I think I'm the kind of person who can make the best out of the worst situation.\" This early experience of upheaval might go some way to explaining the obliqueness of the theme behind his current collection. \"I come from a split-up island where a lot of people had to leave their homes, so I guess it's an awareness I've always had, this idea of evacuation and then creating another life somewhere else.\" </p> <p> Has he grown to love London now? \"I still don't know if I feel comfortable in London. There are strong cultural differences. But it seems quite a liberal place. Compared with most European cities, it's a melting pot.\" </p> <p>Cities, European and otherwise, are something Chalayan is an expert on: he travels extensively and frequently for the love of his work. As the designer behind the US cashmere company Tse since November 1998, he travels to New York up to 16 times a year, while last year alone he hosted exhibitions in Paris, Tokyo and Vienna. \"A lot of people see travelling as glamorous. 'Oh, you jet-setter, you.' Such an annoying comment. Apart from exhausting, it's just unhealthy.\" </p> <p>Will he continue to show his own collection in London for the foreseeable future? As one of the star attractions, his defection would be a sad loss. \"You never know what's going to happen,\" says Chalayan ominously. \"But at the moment I'm not planning to change.\" And will he stay with Tse for the next two years? \"I don't know. I'm working with them right now.\" </p> <p>It's easy to read too much into this, given that Chalayan has been mentioned in the fashion trade press as a contender to take over at Jil Sander. The German designer sold her name to Prada before quitting as head of her company after artistic differences with Patrizio Bertelli, the notoriously difficult chairman and husband of Miuccia. Chalayan's design philosophy would certainly fit perfectly with the luxurious, clean-lined minimalism of the Sander label, but Chalayan and Bertelli? It would be like mixing oil with water. </p> <p>\"There are very few companies that really understand their designers. Most of the time it's such an economic decision. I think the future is not necessarily to own people but to help people do what they can do well. Ownership is very much an 80s mentality. It's more about facilitating things for people.\" </p> <p>Chalayan is adamant that he would never sell his own company. Can he confirm or deny the Sander rumours? \"There's nothing going on at all,\" he says quietly. \"I just don't want to comment on it. It's embarrassing to talk about.\" For him, or for them? \"Both - for anyone. I'd rather you didn't say anything. The reality is that they're speaking to different people, and at this point it doesn't mean anything. Things only mean things when there's an offer.\" </p> <p>Watch this space.</p>",

      "bodyText": "'What do you think it was about?\" Hussein Chalayan, 29, British designer of the year, crown prince of avant-garde fashion, the creative force behind Tse cashmere and prime candidate (if rumours are to be believed) for the chief designer's job at Jil Sander has a habit of deflecting questions back at you. I had asked him to explain the inspiration behind his last show, held at Sadler's Wells Theatre during February's London Fashion Week to huge critical acclaim. Certainly, the show was a display of design genius: razor-sharp tailoring, innovative cutting techniques, stunning sculptural details... but what do I think it was about? Tricky one, that. Since the finale involved models donning sofa covers that turned into dresses and tables that turned into skirts, accompanied by a group of live Bulgarian singers (whose performance was projected through a television screen which formed part of the stage set), I wouldn't like to hazard a guess. \"It was about times of war, when peoples' houses are raided and they're told to leave in five or 10 minutes or they'll get killed. It was the idea of having to evacuate your home,\" says Chalayan, earnestly. \"So the idea was to take a horrific situation like that and contradict it - to represent it in an almost beautiful way. The idea was to hide those possessions that mean a lot to you: hiding the clothes on chairs, turning the chairs into suitcases, and carrying them away. So it's like you've carried your environment with you.\" And to think most designers' inspiration is \"the 80s\". Hussein Chalayan is deeper than that. A clumsy metaphor for his deepness can be found back in 1993, when he buried his degree collection in a friend's back garden, just to see what happened to the fabric. Fresh out of Central Saint Martins, he was awarded a window in the swanky London store Browns for his trouble - just like John Galliano before him. His collection of two seasons ago was based on principles from the Cartesian world view (don't ask); previous shows have included dresses suspended by helium balloons, jackets that lit up with red dots like a flight path and electronically controlled petticoats whose skirts opened out like aeroplane wings coming in to land. In lesser hands, this could be dismissed as pretentious twaddle. For who would wear an aeroplane wing skirt down the pub? In Chalayan's hands, however, it takes fashion for ward. This is fashion as performance art, as something to be marvelled at. As buyers for Liberty, Harrods and Whistles will testify, Chalayan does wearable things, too. They wouldn't be stocking him this season otherwise. Nor would Topshop have commissioned him to design a range for its TS label: the collaboration is now over, but September will see him pep up the rails of an even more mainstream high street store. Marks &amp; Spencer has asked him to design a range for its Autograph collection. See? Creativity and commerce can make happy playfellows. The latter facilitates the former, as Chalayan is well aware. \"All my sponsors have been very nice.\" Ask Chalayan even the simplest question and his brow furrows with a concern borne out of the importance of making himself clear. Who would he like to see as Mayor of London? \"Oh god. Um. Livingstone. I think he should get it. I hope it happens. You never know until things happen... what you think could happen and the consequences of what really happens are unimaginable.\" What book is he reading? \"I'm not reading a book at the moment, I'm reading bits of books. Usually I read theory books, and sometimes they can get so difficult that I don't have the heart to actually start... Maybe I should start reading novels. What are you reading?\" Chalayan lives to work. Most designers do. So painstaking, so relentless is the design process - from inspiration to sketchbook to fabric to dummy to model to catwalk to department store to bank balance - that only those dedicated to the point of obsession have the drive to survive. Chalayan doesn't know how many hours a day he works (\"time just goes\"), but it doesn't leave much time over for anything else. When you engage him in first date-style conversational gambits, his responses are apologetic and vague. Does he cook much? \"Not as much as I would like to.\" Does he have a favourite TV programme? \"I don't really watch TV. It's fun, but when you have time. It's quite sad, because a lot of people might talk about programmes that are on and stuff, and I've kind of missed out. 'Ali G said this, Ali G said that...' I haven't seen Ali G. Bj\u00f6rk was taking the piss out of me the other day for not knowing who Ali G was.\" Chalayan isn't name-dropping when he mentions his friend Bj\u00f6rk, an early champion of his clothes. When he says he doesn't notice which celebrities wear Hussein Chalayan, you believe him. Celebrity is a distraction from fashion: during his acceptance speech at the British Fashion Awards, he made an earnest plea to the press not to value celebrity endorsement over genuine creativity (this after Posh Spice had received blanket coverage for modelling in the mediocre Maria Grachvogel show). \"All the designers just work so hard; they deserved that space more than Posh Spice. Sometimes, this country is all about celebrities and football and pubs. I thought the fashion press might have been able to transcend that, but obviously the papers asked them to report on whatever was apt.\" Chalayan should be used to Britain's obsessions by now: he has lived here since he was 12. But he retains the viewpoint of the detached outsider. The only child of Turkish-Cypriot parents (they divorced when he was five), he was a boarder at Highgate Boys School, north London - an experience he once likened to being in the army. \"It was excruciatingly difficult, but I suppose I tried to channel it positively. I think I'm the kind of person who can make the best out of the worst situation.\" This early experience of upheaval might go some way to explaining the obliqueness of the theme behind his current collection. \"I come from a split-up island where a lot of people had to leave their homes, so I guess it's an awareness I've always had, this idea of evacuation and then creating another life somewhere else.\" Has he grown to love London now? \"I still don't know if I feel comfortable in London. There are strong cultural differences. But it seems quite a liberal place. Compared with most European cities, it's a melting pot.\" Cities, European and otherwise, are something Chalayan is an expert on: he travels extensively and frequently for the love of his work. As the designer behind the US cashmere company Tse since November 1998, he travels to New York up to 16 times a year, while last year alone he hosted exhibitions in Paris, Tokyo and Vienna. \"A lot of people see travelling as glamorous. 'Oh, you jet-setter, you.' Such an annoying comment. Apart from exhausting, it's just unhealthy.\" Will he continue to show his own collection in London for the foreseeable future? As one of the star attractions, his defection would be a sad loss. \"You never know what's going to happen,\" says Chalayan ominously. \"But at the moment I'm not planning to change.\" And will he stay with Tse for the next two years? \"I don't know. I'm working with them right now.\" It's easy to read too much into this, given that Chalayan has been mentioned in the fashion trade press as a contender to take over at Jil Sander. The German designer sold her name to Prada before quitting as head of her company after artistic differences with Patrizio Bertelli, the notoriously difficult chairman and husband of Miuccia. Chalayan's design philosophy would certainly fit perfectly with the luxurious, clean-lined minimalism of the Sander label, but Chalayan and Bertelli? It would be like mixing oil with water. \"There are very few companies that really understand their designers. Most of the time it's such an economic decision. I think the future is not necessarily to own people but to help people do what they can do well. Ownership is very much an 80s mentality. It's more about facilitating things for people.\" Chalayan is adamant that he would never sell his own company. Can he confirm or deny the Sander rumours? \"There's nothing going on at all,\" he says quietly. \"I just don't want to comment on it. It's embarrassing to talk about.\" For him, or for them? \"Both - for anyone. I'd rather you didn't say anything. The reality is that they're speaking to different people, and at this point it doesn't mean anything. Things only mean things when there's an offer.\" Watch this space.",

      "body": "<p>Moves towards closer European security and defence cooperation will get a boost today when Eurocorps, the French-sponsored multinational military grouping, takes over the running of the international peacekeeping force in Kosovo.</p> <p>It is the first time in Nato's history that the alliance has entrusted an external operation to a unit which is not part of its integrated, US-dominated, command structure.</p> <p>A Spanish general, Juan Ortuno, commander of Eurocorps, will take over K-For's headquarters in Pristina with a senior French officer as his deputy. He will command nearly 1,000 staff officers, including US, British, and Russian personnel.</p> <p>The decision to give Eurocorps the task of controlling K-For after months of pressure from France and Germany has deep political resonance at a time when the US remains unhappy about EU plans for a European security and defence identity.</p> <p>Eurocorps is a politically-driven creation from which Britain has kept its distance on the grounds that it is potentially divisive and more symbolic than militarily effective. Originally proposed by France, it now includes Germany, Spain, Belgium, and Luxembourg. It consists of 60,000 soldiers, based in Strasbourg, though it will contribute just 335 senior officers to the K-For headquarters, 30% of the total.</p> <p>Eurocorps has never acted separately from Nato, and alliance officials insisted yesterday that K-For would remain Nato-led.

      "bodyText": "Moves towards closer European security and defence cooperation will get a boost today when Eurocorps, the French-sponsored multinational military grouping, takes over the running of the international peacekeeping force in Kosovo. It is the first time in Nato's history that the alliance has entrusted an external operation to a unit which is not part of its integrated, US-dominated, command structure. A Spanish general, Juan Ortuno, commander of Eurocorps, will take over K-For's headquarters in Pristina with a senior French officer as his deputy. He will command nearly 1,000 staff officers, including US, British, and Russian personnel. The decision to give Eurocorps the task of controlling K-For after months of pressure from France and Germany has deep political resonance at a time when the US remains unhappy about EU plans for a European security and defence identity. Eurocorps is a politically-driven creation from which Britain has kept its distance on the grounds that it is potentially divisive and more symbolic than militarily effective. Originally proposed by France, it now includes Germany, Spain, Belgium, and Luxembourg. It consists of 60,000 soldiers, based in Strasbourg, though it will contribute just 335 senior officers to the K-For headquarters, 30% of the total. Eurocorps has never acted separately from Nato, and alliance officials insisted yesterday that K-For would remain Nato-led. K-For will revert to an integrated Nato command after six months. The US remains sceptical about the EU's pledge to create an autonomous rapid reaction force of 60,000 soldiers, separate from Eurocorps, by 2003. Under this plan, the soldiers would be deployable within 60 days and be able to participate in peacekeeping operations for a year. Because of rotation needs, the plan would require up to 200,000 soldiers. As Lord Robertson, Nato's secretary general, has pointed out, the European allies, with 2m mainly conscripted men and women under arms, had trouble fielding 40,000 soldiers for Kosovo. The EU has agreed that its proposed force would be deployed in operations only after Nato has declined to do so. Before the end of the year, the EU is due to hold its first \"force generation\" conference, where member states would be asked to make offers of troop numbers and equipment for the proposed rapid reaction force. The US continues to express concern that the plan could be divisive, involve a new tier of bureaucracy, and that non-EU European allies could be excluded from decision-making. The EU has recently set up a political and security committee and a military committee, as well as an international military staff attached to its Brussels headquarters. The coming months will be decisive in helping to shape Nato's future, not least since France, keen to seize the opportunity for greater European independence in security affairs, takes over the EU presidency, on July 1.",

      "bodyText": "The birthplace of music's most infamous composer will today attempt to persuade the world that Antonio Salieri did not poison Amadeus Mozart - more than 200 years after the myth took hold. The town of Legnago in northern Italy wants to recast Salieri as a sublime talent who encouraged his rivals and fed them ice cream, not arsenic. As part of its attempt at rehabilitation, the town has lured historians and musicologists to a month-long festival of his work, starting today. Organisers hope the beauty of Salieri's compositions, which are rarely performed, and an analysis of the evidence surrounding the poisoning claim will help him to be seen as a misunderstood genius, wrongly vilified. Salieri's supporters blame an opera singer, Callisto Bassi, for starting the poison rumour soon after Mozart died of unknown causes in 1791, aged 35. The Russian dramatist Pushkin immortalised the allegation in a play which in 1898 was turned into an opera - Mozart et Salieri - by Rimsky-Korsakov. Peter Shaffer sealed the image of a mediocrity tormented by his younger rival in the 1979 play Amadeus. It was turned into an Oscar-winning film five years later, in which Murray Abraham portrayed Salieri as a sociopath, convincing a new generation that the Italian was a killer. In Legnago, near Veneto, a sense of injustice burns. The locals, who say that for two centuries the town has been inhibited from celebrating a local hero, believe it is time to scotch the myth for ever. Rudolph Angermuller, the director of the Mozart Foundation in Salzburg, is supporting their cause. Salieri, born in 1750, was appointed court conductor in Vienna in 1788. He wrote 45 operas, including Tarare, and was hailed as one of the greatest composers of the age. A favourite of the Hapsburg royals, he also wrote vocal, choral, instrumental and orchestral music, finding success across Europe. Der Schauspieldirektor, by Mozart, and Salieri's Prima la Musica, Poi le Parole were jointly premiered at the Viennese court in 1786. The audience preferred Salieri. Prof Angermuller said such success disproves the notion that Salieri, married with eight children, was consumed by envy after being eclipsed by Mozart. In reality he was a pedantic but generous mentor to contemporaries such as Beethoven and Schubert. \"He was abstemious but he had a weakness for ice cream and was always offering it to Schubert,\" Prof Angermuller told La Repubblica. Mozart's widow sent her son Franz Xaver Wolfgang to study under Salieri. \"Which mother would would make her son study under the murderer of her husband?\" asked Prof Angermuller. Towards the end of his life Salieri suffered a nervous breakdown and would sometimes accuse himself of killing Mozart, but his contemporaries dismissed it as raving. He was given a magnificent funeral in 1825 and seemed destined for posthumous acclaim, but the rumours started by Bassi reached Pushkin. The cause of Mozart's premature death remains a mystery. Possibilities include fever, TB or kidney failure. One theory says he was accidentally poisoned by doctors who were treating a fever. Another theory suggests that Mozart died from a brain injury sustained when he fell over while drunk. Symptoms of nausea, headaches, weakness, paralysis and confusion were, some doctors believe, more consistent with brain injuries than poisoning. Salieri's habit of writing operas which require expensive sets and casts also helps to explain why his music is rarely performed, said Prof Angermuller. But the people of Legnago hope the situation will change. The town's Salieri festival continues until May 13.",

Police are working on the theory that Frank Fairless, 36, killed the boys at his home near Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, because he was depressed about the break-up of his marriage. He then hanged himself. His sons Christopher, nine, and Oliver, six, were killed during their first overnight access visit to their father's house in Scotter since he split up with his wife, Claire. The boys' bodies were found in their beds. Police discovered all three bodies on Sunday evening after they received a call from James Forrington, the children's grandfather, who was concerned about their safety. The boys had been picked up by their father at 9am on Saturday for an access visit. They had been due to be returned to their mother at 5pm the following day, but when they had not arrived by 6.15pm, her family contacted police. Mr Forrington said: \"We can't take in what has happened. We know as little as anybody else.\" At the time of the deaths, Mr Fairless's estranged wife was staying with her parents at their home a mile away. Mr Fairless, a self-employed builder, built the detached cottage for his family four years ago. The couple named the property \"Olverchris\" cottage after their two sons. The trio had been seen having lunch together at the Gamekeeper pub in Scotter on Saturday afternoon. Neighbours said that they were horrified to hear of the deaths of the two boys and their father. Brian Welch, 70, said: \"Everybody here is stunned. They were a friendly family and always had time for a chat. The two boys were cheery little things and very pleasant - I can't believe that they are gone. \"Most of the houses around here have young families and all the children in the area play together.

DCI White said it was too early to say how the boys met their deaths, but he confirmed the police were not looking for anybody else in connection with the inquiry. He added that a number of handwritten notes were recovered at the scene. Mrs Fairless was last night being comforted by her family and specially trained police officers.",

Seven shootings in a month are being linked to a territorial struggle by armed criminals, culminating at the weekend with what appears to be the accidental killing of a notorious local figure in Meanwood, east Leeds. He died where the bouquets now rest against a concrete wall. West Yorkshire police believe that Frank Birley, who had been released six months ago from a 14-year sentence for armed robbery and hostage-taking, was killed on Friday night when an accomplice on a \"punishment raid\" slipped and fired as he fell. A 17-year-old youth was shot in the leg just before Birley was killed and is under armed police protection. Messages stuck to the flowers in Sugar Well Road where Birley collapsed fatally wounded, refer to him as King of New York - a title taken from the US crime novel and film - and in one case promise: \"All will be reveled\" (sic). Birley, who was 33 and also known as Frank Gatt, is thought to have been trying to re-establish his position in Leeds. He was released from prison after serving nine years for a \u00a3147,000 armed raid on a Blackpool jewellers which went wrong. At his trial he was described as violent and dangerous after holding a 78-year-old woman and her 52-year-old daughter at gunpoint during a nine-hour police siege. A retired engineer, Harry Hemsley, 66, described yesterday how he saw the man thought to be Birley's accomplice run past his drive after the killing. Mr Birley said he and his wife were seeing visitors into a taxi. \"A man came running out of the night waving a gun at me. He just said 'Get out of my way' and went past at what seemed like 100mph. This man wasn't panicking and looked as though he was in control - he could see we were no threat.\" The alleged punishment raid on the 17-year-old which led to Birley's death shares a pattern with the previous six shootings. Craig Mirfield, 34, took a single bullet in the head as he tried to escape from a gunman in Gipton last month. Clifton \"Junior\" Bryan, 29, was shot in Chapeltown Road. Seven years ago he was under police armed guard, after being ambushed and shot outside St James's University hospital in east Leeds. Paul Garvin, assistant chief constable of West Yorkshire police, said that the shootings appeared to involve deliberately chosen targets. Links are also being checked with a gunman's raid on a young couple's house in Seacroft, east Leeds, which left a man with powder burns after a shotgun went off during a struggle, and two shootings on the same day last week, which saw a 23-year-old man suffer minor gunshot injuries. The force's blue and white scene-of-crime tapes meanwhile went up again yesterday after the body of a 36-year-old local man was found slumped in the backyard of the Leeds Rifleman pub in Little London in the inner east end. Police said that he had died of head injuries and the case was being treated as murder, but postmortem checks have yet to establish if firearms were again involved. Police are also investigating rumours that a price had been put on Birley's head by one or more rivals who had flourished while he was behind bars. Inspector Russell Clark said: \"I think it's certainly an unusual situation we are dealing with here.\"",
