Its latest programme is expected to take at least a year to complete.</p> <p>Nice has already issued guidance on 15 technology appraisals, including controverisal decisions to \"ban\" the flu drug relenza and fund taxanes cancer drugs.</p> <p>The programme announced today is as follows:</p> <p><strong>Smoking cessation:</strong> The Nice appraisal will provide GPs with cost and clinical effectiveness evidence for the use of the smoking cessation aids NRT and bupropion (Zyban) in primary care. It will play a significant role in the government's aim of reducing cancer, heart disease and smoking rates in the population. </p> <p><strong>Schizophrenia:</strong> Last year, the Department of Health (DoH) commissioned the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the British Psychological Society to develop guidelines on the management of schizophrenia. Preliminary work was undertaken to look at the evidence concerning the so-called \"new\" anti-psychotic drugs. This made it clear that a thorough examination was needed of the evidence for all the drugs relevant in the management of schizophrenia, including the traditional drugs. Nice will ensure that a thorough, independent review of the evidence is carried out. </p> <p><strong>Rhesus disease:</strong> The DoH welcomed publication of the guidance on prevention of Rhesus disease from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. This guidance included a new recommendation that routine antenatal prophylaxis - an injection of immunogobulin - should be offered to all Rhesus negative women in pregnancy to make a rare cause of neonatal deaths rarer still. Nice will advise on the clinical and cost effectiveness of this treatment as a routine prophylaxis. </p> <p><strong>Crohn's Disease:</strong> Crohn's disease is distressing for sufferers, and it is believed the numbers affected are growing. The Nice appraisal will look at the use of the drug Infliximab, in line with licensed indications, after conventional treatments have failed, and Nice will advise on extended and repeated use as well as single dose. </p> <p><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis:</strong> Rheumatoid arthritis affects about 5% of women and 2% of men. Nice has been asked to appraise two new treatments, Etanercept and Infliximab, which are used if anti-rheumatic drugs are no longer effective. </p> <p><strong>Asthma in older children:</strong> There is high use of asthma inhalers in childhood and considerable variation in treatment regimes and differences in the range of inhalers available. This increases the difficulty in providing a quality package of care, improving the control of asthma and lessening the effect on children who suffer from this common condition. A more considered and evidence based approach to the treatment of asthma in childhood is needed. Nice will consider and advise. </p> <p><strong>Asthma care:</strong> New evidence-based national guidelines are needed for the management of asthma in adults and children in both primary and secondary care. These will help reduce the number of asthma attacks. Current guidelines are not evidence-based. </p> <p><strong>Heart failure:</strong> Heart failure affects a growing number of people, particularly the elderly. It can be difficult to diagnose and the quality of treatment offered is extremely variable. Patients are subject to frequent acute hospital readmissions due to poor symptom control and often suffer a poor quality of life, particularly during the latter stages of their illness. These clinical guidelines will help doctors and other medical staff in both primary and secondary care deliver more effective diagnosis and treatment for these patients and improve their quality of life.</p> <p><strong>Eating disorders:</strong> Expertise and services are not equally distributed around the country. Not everyone who needs treatment is able to access it easily or quickly. These points are made in the national service framework for mental health. The guidelines will cover the full range of treatments normally available as part of healthcare for people judged to need help. Inpatient treatment is the \"established\" approach for severe cases of anorexia with extremely low body weight, but outpatient treatment is appropriate for less severe, more common cases and for people with bulimia. Treatment usually involves a form of psychological therapy and advice and guidance on nutrition. In young people, families are commonly involved in treatment as well. </p> <p><strong>Depression:</strong> Depression will affect nearly half of all women and a quarter of all men in the UK before the age of 70 and, at any one time, the prevalence of major depression in the general population is about 5%. Severe depression also carries a raised risk of death by suicide and this is now the second most common cause of death in those under the age of 35. Depression is a common condition, with the vast majority of cases managed in primary care, but services for people with depression are of variable quality, and services are sometimes difficult to access. </p> <p><strong>Caesarean section:</strong> The Government is concerned about the variation in caesarean section rates between hospitals and has a programme in hand to address this and the reasons for the rise in caesarean section rate overall. The national sentinel audit will establish the reasons behind caesarean sections. Nice will use information from this survey to produce evidence-based guidelines for when a caesarean section is necessary. </p> <p><strong>Common medical emergencies:</strong> The work will produce a series of guidelines covering a range of situations where immediate action needs to be taken either to deal with an acute emergency or to prevent an emergency taking place. They will be up-to-date and evidence based and will be continuously updated. Guidelines on healthcare associated infection Healthcare associated infection is a serious problem for the NHS. It can be life-threatening and uses considerable NHS resources. The guidelines will help promote sound infection control in both primary and community care. They will also provide clear statements of good practice for all staff. </p> <p><strong>Head injuries:</strong> Initial assessment, management and referral. The major concern in the management of head-injured patients is to detect damage and impairment early and minimise secondary brain and spinal cord injuries. Prompt and effective initial management can limit the number of patients left with significant behavioural, cognitive, emotional and physical disabilities. Development of clinical guidelines will support the implementation of the health secretary's priorities for modernisation strategies, in accident &amp; emergency, care of critically ill adults, strategy on paediatric intensive care, caring for vulnerable people including children. </p> <p><strong>Diabetes:</strong> The management of type one diabetes has a significant impact on health, including the likelihood of developing long term complications. People with type one diabetes have a life expectancy 25% lower than people without diabetes. Yet there are marked variations around the country in current practice as well as in the outcomes of care. The development by Nice of clinical guidelines for type one diabetes will contribute to the implementation of the diabetes national service framework, which is to be published in 2001 for implementation in the NHS from 2002. </p> <p><strong>Under consideration for referral to Nice:</strong></p> <p><strong>Ramipril for patients with heart disease:</strong> Recent trial evidence suggests that the drug Ramipril may significantly reduce the risk of death, heart attack and stroke for many patients with or at risk of heart disease, and in particular patients with diabetes. The appraisal by Nice of Ramipril will support consistent and effectively targeted prescribing of the drug for these patients. </p> <p><strong>Growth hormone replacement:</strong> Growth hormone has been used for many years to promote growth in childhood, essentially where there is an absence of naturally produced hormone. However this treatment has sometimes been used to promote growth where there is little evidence of benefit or hormonal deficiency. There is also a lack of sufficient information on the long term results of growth hormone treatment in children of short stature. The highly demanding nature and high costs of this treatment require an optimised prescription, and this remains to be determined. Nice will consider this. This appraisal will also be extended to adult use, subject to further consultation.</p>",

Another 11,200 are needed to deal with the backlog of homelessness, overcrowding and poor housing conditions. \"What we have arrived at is a vision of London as a thriving, inclusive world city in which all its inhabitants have a decent and affordable home in neighbourhoods where they want to live, within reasonable reach of their work and with high quality public services,\" said Chris Holmes, chairman of the Housing Commission and director of the homeless charity Shelter. However, Conservative regeneration spokesman Tim Loughton said that such levels of increased \"social housing\" would endanger urban regeneration in the capital and inappropriately take control of housing away from London boroughs. \"Livingstone is still living in the 1970s, trying to recreate a mythical socialist utopia. A left-wing municipal housing policy will be a recipe for continued deprivation and decay in London,\" he said.",

The crisis on the streets could have been contained, but the key problem for the peacemakers is that the issue has moved on to become a conflict between rival states. Stone-throwing protests by Palestinian youths are giving way to carefully calculated attacks on Israeli troops and the 200,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza. In addition, Israel has repeatedly used helicopter gunships to attack key Palestinian sites, including Yasser Arafat's headquarters. Mr Arafat calls the conflict a \"war\".</p> <p><b>Why do the Palestinians attack?</b><br>Specifically, they want Israel to retreat to its pre-1967 borders and give the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem to the Palestinians. More generally, many resent what they consider to be an Israeli military occupation and the increasing number of Jewish settlers. </p> <p><b>Why does Israel attack?</b><br>Israel says it will revenge the death of its citizens and, without fail, uses its army to strike against the organisations and individuals it believes are behind the attacks. Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak says he supports peace but public opinion says the army is not being tough enough. </p> <p><b>But wasn't the peace process dead in the water anyway? </b> <br> The last serious attempt to negotiate a permanent settlement was made at the Camp David summit in July. It ended in failure after 15 days, but not before the two sides had come tantalisingly close to wrapping up a deal.</p> <p><b>What progress was made? </b><br>Leaks from Camp David suggested that agreement was within reach on the issues of refugees and the boundaries of a future Palestinian state. But deep differences remain over Jerusalem.</p> <p><b>What are the remaining sticking points? </b><br>Land. Mr Arafat wants Israel to return all Palestinian territory occupied since the 1967 war, including the West Bank, where the Palestinian authority has full sovereignty over only 40% of the land. Israel appears willing to cede 92%. Discussion on territory is hugely complicated by some 145 Jewish settlements dotted throughout the West Bank occupied by some 200,000 Israelis. As many as 40,000 settlers may have to move to Israel proper, or live under Palestinian rule. Smaller settlements would go, particularly in the Jordan Valley, but three large blocs would stay.</p> <p><b>What about refugees? </b><br>There are some 3.6m registered Palestinian refugees in Jordan, driven out when Israel was created in 1948. Israel has so far refused the Palestinians' right to return, endorsed by UN resolutions, or to accept moral and legal responsibility for their expulsion and consequent hardships. There are proposals that Japan, the US and Europe contribute to a fund to help the Palestinian authority handle those who want to return or compensate those who do not want to come back.</p> <p><b>If talks resume will Jerusalem be the most contentious issue?</b><br>This could be the deal breaker. Both sides consider Jerusalem as their own holy capital and Mr Barak refuses to contemplate its division. The Palestinians have a sliver of the city in Abu Dis, the village straddling the city boundaries where a Palestinian parliament is being built. Despite Israel's tough public line, leaks suggest that Mr Barak might cede two Palestinian neighbourhoods in the north, Shuafat and Beit Hanina. Jerusalem is such an emotional and difficult issue, it might be shelved for later.</p> <p><b>Are there any prospects for negotiations to resume?</b><br>In the short term, hope lies with international leaders - especially Bill Clinton who is keen to broker a deal before he leaves office in January. Mr Clinton regularly speaks to Mr Arafat and Mr Barak but the best he can hope for is maybe to prevent all out war. The Israelis say they will not resume talks until shooting attacks against on their army stop but senior Palestinians say the confrontations will continue through future talks.</p> <p><b>When will it end?</b><br>No one knows. However, Israel has a non-military strategy to put pressure on the Palestinians to meet their demands. The West Bank and Gaza are small disjointed territories and Israel is taking advantage of their vunerability with a blockade of the towns and villages that is crippling the local economy. Unemployment is already high among the Palestinians since the one-sixth of the workforce employed in Israel has been barred from going to the country and, by extension, their jobs. Mr Barak has also blocked the tax revenues that Israel collects for the Palestinians.

      "body": "<p>In the latest legal attempt to win the contested US presidency, Al Gore asked a Florida judge today to force the state to count disputed presidential ballots being hand tallied after a deadline had passed.</p> <p>Mr Gore, who trails George W Bush by 300 votes in Florida, asked the judge to reverse a Republican state official's decision to reject vote counts still going on in some counties.</p> <p>The Democrats want final vote certification in Florida delayed until all those totals are in.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the same circuit judge, Terry Lewis, had upheld that day's state deadline for submitting results of recounts to the state elections board. But he also had said the secretary of state for Florida, Katherine Harris, had flexibility in deciding whether to accept late filings.</p> <p>Four counties - three of them heavily Democratic - asked for an extension. Ms Harris turned them down late last night. Judge Lewis scheduled a hearing for 1700GMT today.</p> <p>There was no immediate response from Ms Harris in court. It was not clear how much authority the state court had to intervene, and the case could pass quickly to the state supreme court, where other election-related cases are pending.</p> <p>There are over 20 court cases pending today and countywide hand recounts are still in dispute.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr Gore and Mr Bush's PR battle has moved into a new phase. Vice president, Mr Gore, said last night: \"I don't know what the final results will show.\" He suggested a state-wide hand recount of Florida's 6m votes as a way to achieve a \"fair and final\" result without further legal manoeuvring.</p> <p>Mr Bush, the Texas governor, countered that a few hours later in rejecting the vice president's suggestions. \"The outcome of this election will not be the result of deals or efforts to mould public opinion,\"</p> <p>Hand recounting, which Gore wants, \"introduces human error and politics into the vote-counting process,\" said Mr Bush.</p> <p>Democrats also filed papers arguing against the Bush campaign before a federal appeals court in Atlanta. Mr Bush is also in that court trying to overturn a federal ruling in Florida that let the recount continue.</p> <p>\"This case is simply not appropriate for federal court intervention of any kind at this point in the proceeding,\" Mr Gore's lawyers argued in a brief filed this morning with the 11th US circuit court of appeals in Atlanta.</p> <p>Mr Bush's team, in arguments to the same court seeking to stop hand recounts in the four Democratic Florida counties, warned that Americans are witnessing the \"disintegration\" of the way they elect presidents. The Bush camp complains hand counts are prone to error.</p> <p>Mr Bush's lawyers said in their submission: \"Eight days after Florida's presidential vote, the entire nation is witnessing the disintegration of a process that was designed to elect America's president.</p> <p>\"The Florida manual recount process is being used to eliminate any possibility of an orderly, rational and final end to the election.\"</p> <p>The federal court's unusually rapid decision to get involved could launch the controversy toward the US supreme court.</p> <p>The winner in the stalemated Florida vote will claim the state's decisive 25 electoral votes and almost certainly the White House.

      "bodyText": "In the latest legal attempt to win the contested US presidency, Al Gore asked a Florida judge today to force the state to count disputed presidential ballots being hand tallied after a deadline had passed. Mr Gore, who trails George W Bush by 300 votes in Florida, asked the judge to reverse a Republican state official's decision to reject vote counts still going on in some counties. The Democrats want final vote certification in Florida delayed until all those totals are in. On Tuesday, the same circuit judge, Terry Lewis, had upheld that day's state deadline for submitting results of recounts to the state elections board. But he also had said the secretary of state for Florida, Katherine Harris, had flexibility in deciding whether to accept late filings. Four counties - three of them heavily Democratic - asked for an extension. Ms Harris turned them down late last night. Judge Lewis scheduled a hearing for 1700GMT today. There was no immediate response from Ms Harris in court. It was not clear how much authority the state court had to intervene, and the case could pass quickly to the state supreme court, where other election-related cases are pending. There are over 20 court cases pending today and countywide hand recounts are still in dispute. Meanwhile, Mr Gore and Mr Bush's PR battle has moved into a new phase. Vice president, Mr Gore, said last night: \"I don't know what the final results will show.\" He suggested a state-wide hand recount of Florida's 6m votes as a way to achieve a \"fair and final\" result without further legal manoeuvring. Mr Bush, the Texas governor, countered that a few hours later in rejecting the vice president's suggestions. \"The outcome of this election will not be the result of deals or efforts to mould public opinion,\" Hand recounting, which Gore wants, \"introduces human error and politics into the vote-counting process,\" said Mr Bush. Democrats also filed papers arguing against the Bush campaign before a federal appeals court in Atlanta. Mr Bush is also in that court trying to overturn a federal ruling in Florida that let the recount continue. \"This case is simply not appropriate for federal court intervention of any kind at this point in the proceeding,\" Mr Gore's lawyers argued in a brief filed this morning with the 11th US circuit court of appeals in Atlanta. Mr Bush's team, in arguments to the same court seeking to stop hand recounts in the four Democratic Florida counties, warned that Americans are witnessing the \"disintegration\" of the way they elect presidents. The Bush camp complains hand counts are prone to error. Mr Bush's lawyers said in their submission: \"Eight days after Florida's presidential vote, the entire nation is witnessing the disintegration of a process that was designed to elect America's president. \"The Florida manual recount process is being used to eliminate any possibility of an orderly, rational and final end to the election.\" The federal court's unusually rapid decision to get involved could launch the controversy toward the US supreme court. The winner in the stalemated Florida vote will claim the state's decisive 25 electoral votes and almost certainly the White House. Mr Gore is hoping to pick up enough votes in the recounts to overtake Mr Bush's narrow lead. Ms Harris announced last night she saw no reason to accept late vote filings. Only absentee ballots from overseas, due in by midnight Friday, will be rolled into the totals, she said. Democrats have sharply criticised Ms Harris, who supported Mr Bush's campaign, as a partisan Republican and suggested her actions have been motivated by her politics. But a lawyer retained by her office, Joseph Klock, defended her today. He said: \"More than half the lawyers who have been working on this for the secretary are Democrats and I bet probably half of them voted for Gore.\" The US president, Bill Clinton, in Brunei for the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit, said that the Florida controversy will likely spur election reforms. \"I think there will be a lot of pressure to improve the form of ballots and the methods of voting and have more clear standards around the country,\" Mr Clinton said as photographers took pictures of him and the Chinese president, Jiang Zemin. Mr Gore spoke again today on radio saying he would \"fight all the way\" to ensure every vote is counted.\"The choice is whether the voters are going to win this election by having every vote count,\" the Democrat said. \"If I'm successful I will certainly fight all the way for the principles that need to be defended,\" Mr Gore said, adding that he would at the same time try to \"reach out to the people who disagree with me.\" Asked if Republicans were trying to steal the election, Mr Gore cautioned, \"I would discourage the use of that word because, again, however it comes out we're going to come behind the winner and please understand there are high emotions on the other side.\" He spoke shortly after his running mate, Joseph Lieberman, warned that an unjust election will cause American to \"go into the new century divided with a president who does not have legitimacy.\" Mr Gore and Mr Bush made separate television appearances last night, the vice president at his official residence in Washington, the Texan at the governor's mansion in Texas. Both men strove for a statesmanlike presentation, and manoeuvred for maximum TV exposure.

There are also planned increases of \u00a3268m in 2002-03 and \u00a3298m in 2003-04. Details have not been released, but the increases include fees from public funding and from students, earmarked capital funding, and funding for widening participation made available through universities. They apply to grants to the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Teacher Training Agency.</p> <p>For academic and non academic pay, universities will receive an extra \u00a350m in 2001-02, an extra \u00a3110m in 2002-03, and an extra \u00a3170m 2003-04. Universities will need to submit plans detailing how they will use funding to \"enhance quality and modernise management of the sector\", particularly addressing equal opportunities issues. Academic leaders have warned that under-funding over the last 20 years is forcing many senior academics to leave UK universities for better paid positions in other professions or more wealthy US academic institutions. </p> <p>Universities currently face industrial action by staff after academic unions rejected a 3 per cent increase in pay offered by administrators.</p> <p>University heads welcomed the news, but are awaiting detailed funding figures from the government. \"Universities will obviously be interested to see the details behind these headline figures, particularly the government's specific targets on additional student numbers for future years,\" said Diana Warwick, Chief Executive of the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals. </p> <p>David Triesman, general secretary of the Association of University Teachers, said: \u0093At first sight the extra resources for pay look very welcome but we will be examining the detail. I shall be writing to university vice-chancellors asking for urgent meetings to discuss the best ways to spend this much-needed boost for the sector.\"</p> <p>The government says that universities and colleges will be able to recruit an additional 45,000 students next year. Over the next two years, \u00a310m has been set aside to develop the new two year foundation degrees, which will be available from August 2001. Further expansion is planned in the following two years to meet the government's aim that, by the age of 30, half of all young people will have benefited from higher education.</p> <p>The new funding package includes \u00a360m over three years from the government's new 'Excellence Challenge' package to improve access for students from low-income families.</p> <p>Officials at the Department for Education and Employment say that funding for English universities by 2003-4 will be \u00a36.4bn - a 10% increase in real terms.</p> <p>Next week the research councils will also announce details of extra \u00a3250m over three years for research into the priority areas of genomics, e-science and basic technology. A further \u00a380m will be available to support university-business links over the three years.</p> <p>In July, the government and the Wellcome Trust also announced \u00a31bn in funding for improvements in the research infrastructure which will be available to institutions in 2002-03 and 2003-04.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Education secretary, David Blunkett, today announced \u00a3330m of new money over the next three years to boost pay for academics and university support staff. The extra funds are part of an overall package unveiled by Blunkett for English universities, which will see funding increase by \u00a3978m - up nearly 10% in real terms over the next three years. According to the Department for Education and Employment, funding will increase overall by \u00a3412m in 2001-02. There are also planned increases of \u00a3268m in 2002-03 and \u00a3298m in 2003-04. Details have not been released, but the increases include fees from public funding and from students, earmarked capital funding, and funding for widening participation made available through universities. They apply to grants to the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Teacher Training Agency. For academic and non academic pay, universities will receive an extra \u00a350m in 2001-02, an extra \u00a3110m in 2002-03, and an extra \u00a3170m 2003-04. Universities will need to submit plans detailing how they will use funding to \"enhance quality and modernise management of the sector\", particularly addressing equal opportunities issues. Academic leaders have warned that under-funding over the last 20 years is forcing many senior academics to leave UK universities for better paid positions in other professions or more wealthy US academic institutions. Universities currently face industrial action by staff after academic unions rejected a 3 per cent increase in pay offered by administrators. University heads welcomed the news, but are awaiting detailed funding figures from the government. \"Universities will obviously be interested to see the details behind these headline figures, particularly the government's specific targets on additional student numbers for future years,\" said Diana Warwick, Chief Executive of the Committee of Vice-chancellors and Principals. David Triesman, general secretary of the Association of University Teachers, said: \u0093At first sight the extra resources for pay look very welcome but we will be examining the detail. I shall be writing to university vice-chancellors asking for urgent meetings to discuss the best ways to spend this much-needed boost for the sector.\" The government says that universities and colleges will be able to recruit an additional 45,000 students next year. Over the next two years, \u00a310m has been set aside to develop the new two year foundation degrees, which will be available from August 2001. Further expansion is planned in the following two years to meet the government's aim that, by the age of 30, half of all young people will have benefited from higher education. The new funding package includes \u00a360m over three years from the government's new 'Excellence Challenge' package to improve access for students from low-income families. Officials at the Department for Education and Employment say that funding for English universities by 2003-4 will be \u00a36.4bn - a 10% increase in real terms. Next week the research councils will also announce details of extra \u00a3250m over three years for research into the priority areas of genomics, e-science and basic technology. A further \u00a380m will be available to support university-business links over the three years. In July, the government and the Wellcome Trust also announced \u00a31bn in funding for improvements in the research infrastructure which will be available to institutions in 2002-03 and 2003-04.",

      "bodyText": "Kevin Satchwell, headteacher of Thomas Telford school in Shropshire, yesterday declared himself the luckiest head in the country after his school became the first comprehensive to chalk up a 100% success rate at GCSE. Every GCSE entrant at the school gained at least five grade A*-C passes - more than twice the national average in the state sector - making it the top comprehensive in the country in the government league tables published today. Thomas Telford opened in 1991 as one of 15 city technology colleges launched by the Tories as part of a programme to raise school standards through innovation. The colleges have been encouraged to use ground-breaking learning and teaching methods relevant to the 21st century and boosted by extra financial resources from the private sector. Pupils at Thomas Telford work a 35-hour week - one-third more than the state school average - and take home 10 detailed teaching reports to their parents every year. The day begins at 7.30am and can last until 7pm. Lessons last three hours. Competition for places is so keen that the school now attracts more than 1,000 applications every year for just 168 first year places. Staff also work a longer week, but are rewarded with performance-related pay and receive extra payment for covering classes and running school clubs and societies. What the tables do not show is that all the pupils achieved at least six passes at the higher grades, while 91% gained 10 or more top grades. Mr Satchwell, who has been head since the school opened, said yesterday: \"No one should underestimate how hard we have worked to achieve 100%.

However, what is clear from the recommendations is that many of the 42,000 big dams already built in the world would not have existed had proper planning taken place, and many of the most controversial currently on the stocks should be abandoned. Many dams have been examined by the Commission. Very few lived up to claims made for them in the planning stage: they almost always took longer to build and cost far more than the original estimates. People affected by the dams, usually the poorest and indigenous groups without a voice, always came off worst, got little or no compensation and had their lives ruined. Those that benefited were the rich and the dam builders who were usually contractors from the developed world backed by the World Bank and export credit agencies with no rules about human rights or proper evaluation of economics.

Then we started to dream of England and what a fantastic dream it was! We saw young David Beckham scampering and young Michael Owen scoring against a team wearing red, blue and yellow. \"Ah, this must be a premonition of England's friendly against Spain in February,\" the Fiver thought - we must be the second coming of Nostradamus.</p> <p>Then we had a peek at the England bench and discovered that boxing promoter Frank Warren was managing the team. Immediately we woke up, convinced our once-mighty psychic powers had somehow deserted us. But had they? Because earlier this afternoon, Charlton revealed they had given the FA permission to speak to Alan Curbishley (a dead-ringer for Mr Warren in a certain light - the darker the better, obviously) about joining the England coaching set-up. </p> <p>\"We have given Adam Crozier of the FA formal permission for Howard Wilkinson to speak to Alan about any role that he might want him to play,\" Charlton chief executive Peter Varney revealed convolutedly. But what's this brewing in the tea-leaves? It's Peter Taylor - and he's indicated that he would be happy to stay on as caretaker England boss for the friendly against Spain in February if asked by the FA. \"I've enjoyed the three days and, as long as it doesn't affect Leicester, I'm happy to help out,\" he says.

      "bodyText": "WE'VE SEEN THE FUTURE After watching the highlights of Italy v England last night, the Fiver gave Queen Elizabeth II a lingering goodnight kiss - the 1p piece does have its uses after all - and crawled into its red-and-white coloured bed. Then we started to dream of England and what a fantastic dream it was! We saw young David Beckham scampering and young Michael Owen scoring against a team wearing red, blue and yellow. \"Ah, this must be a premonition of England's friendly against Spain in February,\" the Fiver thought - we must be the second coming of Nostradamus. Then we had a peek at the England bench and discovered that boxing promoter Frank Warren was managing the team. Immediately we woke up, convinced our once-mighty psychic powers had somehow deserted us. But had they? Because earlier this afternoon, Charlton revealed they had given the FA permission to speak to Alan Curbishley (a dead-ringer for Mr Warren in a certain light - the darker the better, obviously) about joining the England coaching set-up. \"We have given Adam Crozier of the FA formal permission for Howard Wilkinson to speak to Alan about any role that he might want him to play,\" Charlton chief executive Peter Varney revealed convolutedly. But what's this brewing in the tea-leaves? It's Peter Taylor - and he's indicated that he would be happy to stay on as caretaker England boss for the friendly against Spain in February if asked by the FA. \"I've enjoyed the three days and, as long as it doesn't affect Leicester, I'm happy to help out,\" he says. Which could mean there is conflict ahead. Or - as we're hedging our bets - maybe not.

Almost holding hands for comfort, Chief Superintendent Strange and Sergeant Lewis reassured each other that Morse couldn't be in a better place. </p> <p>I suggest that the front row of the chorus at the Folies Berg\u00e8res would have been a better place. The surgeon was a sexual sadist. The nurse died during a bondage session, battered to death by a doctor with an NHS crutch. Which, I may add, was not returned to the hospital. </p> <p>Who, you ask, is in charge of the clattering train? </p> <p>In Colin Dexter's book, Morse died murmuring \"Please, thank Lewis for me\" to a nurse who didn't catch what he said. It was very characteristic of Morse, who had never thanked Lewis for anything in his life, to do so too low and too late.

Almost holding hands for comfort, Chief Superintendent Strange and Sergeant Lewis reassured each other that Morse couldn't be in a better place. I suggest that the front row of the chorus at the Folies Berg\u00e8res would have been a better place. The surgeon was a sexual sadist. The nurse died during a bondage session, battered to death by a doctor with an NHS crutch. Which, I may add, was not returned to the hospital. Who, you ask, is in charge of the clattering train? In Colin Dexter's book, Morse died murmuring \"Please, thank Lewis for me\" to a nurse who didn't catch what he said. It was very characteristic of Morse, who had never thanked Lewis for anything in his life, to do so too low and too late.

      "bodyText": "The executive producer of America's most prestigious current affairs show, 60 Minutes, has hit out at the country's top news anchors. Don Hewitt said that the three big anchors - Dan Rather at CBS, Peter Jennings at ABC and NBC's Tom Brokaw - were now so similar that they should work together. \"If you were locked in a room and forced to watch only Peter Jennings, Tom Brokaw or Dan Rather, you wouldn't miss anything the others had,\" he said. And he told MediaGuardian.co.uk that news anchors should go back to being \"journalists rather than presenters - I'm sick of presenters\". In his controversial new book, Tell Me a Story, the veteran journalist will recommend that the three networks merge their news operations and syndicate a service to the networks for a fee, rather than working as competing commercial services. Mr Hewitt told an audience of senior journalists and TV executives at Newsworld in Barcelona that competition between the networks had eroded the differences in their coverage. At the same time, he said it was essential that journalists should tell a story and have \"a bit of theatricality\". He said: \"You want to find journalists who look like actors playing journalists.\" Mr Hewitt was talking to the British journalist Nik Gowing and Michael Rosenblum a US-based current affairs producer, about the difference between traditional and new current affairs. Delegates noted that magazine shows like 60 Minutes are very successful - 60 Minutes still pulls in $2bn for the network and commands budgets of up to $500,000 per hour - in stark contrast to most US magazine programmes. Mr Rosenblum pointed out that in a multi-channel world, few current affairs programmes would attract the audience share of 60 Minutes. He said the way the producers would make money in the future would be to hold onto the rights for their programmes.",

These people are getting more money, help and sympathy than their victims have ever had.\" But the development has been condemned as dangerous and counterproductive by police, children's charities, and human rights groups. \"We have worked very, very hard to minimise the risk of harm to the public and I think we have accomplished that, but you would only need to get something like this wrong once,\" said Inspector Harry Thorburn, of Grampian police. \"I don't subscribe to the notion that this high media profile, very loud, very strident, clamouring for 'cleaning up a neighbourhood' is effective.\" Mr Carnie said information would be checked before being posted on the site but said he would take full responsiblity for any mistakes. A father of five, Mr Carnie regularly films people in his area whom he believes are paedophiles. He has dismissed suggestions that his website may incite violence. \"I won't ask people to commit acts of violence,\" he said. \"What I would prefer to see them do is say, 'We now know what you are and who you are. We're not going to drive you away, but if we see you approaching our children may your god be near you because you are going to need him'.\" A Glasgow-based human rights lawyer, Allan Miller, described the website as a \"sinister development\", which had the potential to put families at risk. \"It is not going to provide better protection for families and children, it's going to place families and children in more danger because those who are going to be exposed in this way will go underground.\" The creation of the website follows a summer of protests against paedophiles after the murder of Sarah Payne. The News of the World, which launched a name and shame campaign to identify padeophiles, was forced to bow to criticism and end the project. Ray Wyre, who has studied sex offenders, said people needed to have a better understanding of the nature of sexual abuse, the majority of which was not carried out by strangers but occurred within the family. The key to limiting abuse was working with offenders, not driving them away.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In Bilbao earlier this year, the French artist Matthieu Laurette bought a car worth just over 1m pesetas. Then he gave it away on a TV game show called The Big Exchange. That's what happens when a conceptual artist gets his hands on a TV programme's production budget. </p> <p>The game show worked like this: the caller who offered the most expensive new gift in exchange for the car would drive the car home. In the first week, a Bilbao family won by offering a multimedia PC plus printer worth a quarter of the price of the car. The following week, the PC was exchanged for a widescreen TV. The week after, the TV was exchanged for a fridge-freezer. The fridge-freezer was traded for a juicer. It went on like this for two and a half months: in the last week the prize was so crummy that nobody bothered to phone up. </p> <p>Yes, yes, but why is this art? Matthieu Laurette, who is one of 21 French artists taking part in the Vivre Sa Vie season in Edinburgh and Glasgow during November and December, looks across the cafe table and says: \"It's an artistic project because what I'm laying bare is the nature of money, the nature of interest, the value of consumption and the consumption of value. I was recycling money back to the people and showing clearly how it was done. It was quite a laugh, too.\" </p> <p>He's an impish cuss, is Laurette - a little like Chris Morris in his devotion to tearing the media apart, but less sinister. This Sunday, for example, the Pompidou Centre in Paris has a private view for a new exhibition called Beyond the Spectacle. Laurette has a video installation in the show, but more interestingly, he has come up with a project for the pre-show schmooze. </p> <p>Lots of celebrities and journalists are expected to attend, so Laurette arranged for a host of lookalikes to wander round among them. What sort of lookalikes? \"Well, that would give the game away,\" says Laurette. \"But I'm pretty sure Elton John will be there, and the French singer Eddie Mitchell. Not the real ones, you understand.\" But, again, why is this art? \"Because we are in the middle of the society of the spectacle and, if you're an artist, the only thing to do is to pull it apart. It's a great game.\" </p> <p>Laurette, 30, has become a media personality in France thanks to this kind of playful deconstruction of the media, celebrity and consumer culture. For four years, he washed, shaved and ate for free by using only materials that came with offers such as \"satisfaction or your money back\" or \"first purchase refunded\". I don't believe you, I tell him. \"It is absolutely true,\" he replies. \"There are a great deal of these deals in France,\" he adds, showing me the packaging for a Reach toothbrush. </p> <p>\"I'm hoping that when I get to Scotland they will have some of these deals, too, because even though I don't live entirely off them nowadays, I have for the past nine years subsisted mostly off these goods.\" He shows me a package for a Weight Watchers yoghurts special offer that someone brought him from Britain: \"I might have to live off these,\" he says. </p> <p>This artistic project thrust Laurette into the limelight in France. He appeared regularly on TV shows during the 90s, explaining how to get not only a free lunch, but a free shave, too. His expertise as the consumer's friend was widely courted. </p> <p>Laurette recalls his stardom with a grin: \"The project had everything. In France people are obsessed with food, with money, and above all with money-saving scams. What really interested me was another economics - the economics of the artist. Every time I mentioned that I was an artist, ratings fell. If I just kept talking about how to get things for free, people stayed tuned in. </p> <p>\"My celebrity took an identity of its own. I couldn't entirely control it, and that has always been the case with my work: when they write about me in Le Monde, or in your Express newspaper, I am something other than I am. I like that. And it's important for me to present myself to different media outlets in different ways.\" An intellectual art terrorist for the broadsheets, a clued-up shopper for the tabloids? \"That's the general idea.\" </p> <p>Isn't his work just an application of the situationist philosophy of Guy Debord? \"I get that question all the time from journalists. What amazes me is that media people all seem to know their Debord and even their Andy Warhol. They know they are working in a world of spectacle and celebrity, but they carry on anyway - perhaps with a certain amount of cynicism. My role as an artist is to engage with this society of the spectacle and expose its workings.\" </p> <p>He won't tell me what he's planning to do as part of the Vivre Sa Vie season in Edinburgh - \"It isn't finished yet. I'm not sure.\" But his appearances will be worth experiencing, not least because French contemporary art rarely gets shown in Britain. </p> <p>The last such major retrospective was Le Cinq, held at the Tramway in Glasgow nearly 10 years ago. Why isn't French contemporary art very well known or in much demand in Britain? Laurette has a theory. \"In Britain, the artist has become the star, just like movie stars and music stars. They consume the media and are consumed in return. It's a very interesting economy. But that isn't the case in France. How can we compete in that economy?\" </p> <p>Indeed, throughout much of France, one has the feeling that French artists are sniffing smelling salts in response to the vulgar displays across the Channel. Only last month, the French philosopher Paul Virilio published a tirade against contemporary art called La Proc\u00e9dure Silence in which he argued not only that contemporary art was bad, but that it was evil.

      "bodyText": "In Bilbao earlier this year, the French artist Matthieu Laurette bought a car worth just over 1m pesetas. Then he gave it away on a TV game show called The Big Exchange. That's what happens when a conceptual artist gets his hands on a TV programme's production budget. The game show worked like this: the caller who offered the most expensive new gift in exchange for the car would drive the car home. In the first week, a Bilbao family won by offering a multimedia PC plus printer worth a quarter of the price of the car. The following week, the PC was exchanged for a widescreen TV. The week after, the TV was exchanged for a fridge-freezer. The fridge-freezer was traded for a juicer. It went on like this for two and a half months: in the last week the prize was so crummy that nobody bothered to phone up. Yes, yes, but why is this art? Matthieu Laurette, who is one of 21 French artists taking part in the Vivre Sa Vie season in Edinburgh and Glasgow during November and December, looks across the cafe table and says: \"It's an artistic project because what I'm laying bare is the nature of money, the nature of interest, the value of consumption and the consumption of value. I was recycling money back to the people and showing clearly how it was done. It was quite a laugh, too.\" He's an impish cuss, is Laurette - a little like Chris Morris in his devotion to tearing the media apart, but less sinister. This Sunday, for example, the Pompidou Centre in Paris has a private view for a new exhibition called Beyond the Spectacle. Laurette has a video installation in the show, but more interestingly, he has come up with a project for the pre-show schmooze. Lots of celebrities and journalists are expected to attend, so Laurette arranged for a host of lookalikes to wander round among them. What sort of lookalikes? \"Well, that would give the game away,\" says Laurette. \"But I'm pretty sure Elton John will be there, and the French singer Eddie Mitchell. Not the real ones, you understand.\" But, again, why is this art? \"Because we are in the middle of the society of the spectacle and, if you're an artist, the only thing to do is to pull it apart. It's a great game.\" Laurette, 30, has become a media personality in France thanks to this kind of playful deconstruction of the media, celebrity and consumer culture. For four years, he washed, shaved and ate for free by using only materials that came with offers such as \"satisfaction or your money back\" or \"first purchase refunded\". I don't believe you, I tell him. \"It is absolutely true,\" he replies. \"There are a great deal of these deals in France,\" he adds, showing me the packaging for a Reach toothbrush. \"I'm hoping that when I get to Scotland they will have some of these deals, too, because even though I don't live entirely off them nowadays, I have for the past nine years subsisted mostly off these goods.\" He shows me a package for a Weight Watchers yoghurts special offer that someone brought him from Britain: \"I might have to live off these,\" he says. This artistic project thrust Laurette into the limelight in France. He appeared regularly on TV shows during the 90s, explaining how to get not only a free lunch, but a free shave, too. His expertise as the consumer's friend was widely courted. Laurette recalls his stardom with a grin: \"The project had everything. In France people are obsessed with food, with money, and above all with money-saving scams. What really interested me was another economics - the economics of the artist. Every time I mentioned that I was an artist, ratings fell. If I just kept talking about how to get things for free, people stayed tuned in. \"My celebrity took an identity of its own. I couldn't entirely control it, and that has always been the case with my work: when they write about me in Le Monde, or in your Express newspaper, I am something other than I am. I like that. And it's important for me to present myself to different media outlets in different ways.\" An intellectual art terrorist for the broadsheets, a clued-up shopper for the tabloids? \"That's the general idea.\" Isn't his work just an application of the situationist philosophy of Guy Debord? \"I get that question all the time from journalists. What amazes me is that media people all seem to know their Debord and even their Andy Warhol. They know they are working in a world of spectacle and celebrity, but they carry on anyway - perhaps with a certain amount of cynicism. My role as an artist is to engage with this society of the spectacle and expose its workings.\" He won't tell me what he's planning to do as part of the Vivre Sa Vie season in Edinburgh - \"It isn't finished yet. I'm not sure.\" But his appearances will be worth experiencing, not least because French contemporary art rarely gets shown in Britain. The last such major retrospective was Le Cinq, held at the Tramway in Glasgow nearly 10 years ago. Why isn't French contemporary art very well known or in much demand in Britain? Laurette has a theory. \"In Britain, the artist has become the star, just like movie stars and music stars. They consume the media and are consumed in return. It's a very interesting economy. But that isn't the case in France. How can we compete in that economy?\" Indeed, throughout much of France, one has the feeling that French artists are sniffing smelling salts in response to the vulgar displays across the Channel. Only last month, the French philosopher Paul Virilio published a tirade against contemporary art called La Proc\u00e9dure Silence in which he argued not only that contemporary art was bad, but that it was evil. Citing Theodor Adorno's dictum about the impossibility of writing a poem after Auschwitz, Virilio railed against \"the conformism of abjection\" of the Britart Sensation! exhibition. Why was contemporary art evil? Virilio quoted from an interview with an Auschwitz survivor who visited the death camp's museum and recorded her impressions. She had just seen glass cabinets filled with suitcases, prostheses, children's games: \"I wasn't overwhelmed as I was when I was at the camp. No, in the museum, I suddenly had the impression of being in a contemporary art museum. And I said: 'They have won!'\" Though Virilio's analysis has been widely attacked in France, it is suggestive about why French contemporary art isn't as vulgarly virulent as its British counterpart. It is not merely a question of there being no Charles Saatchi to buy the stuff and thus give it exposure. Rather, French contemporary art seems less smugly wounded, more playful; more intellectual, certainly, and less egocentric. Laurette is only an extreme example of this. Another is Pierre Joseph, also showing at Vivre Sa Vie, an artist who has made books, videos and installations that often mistranslate maps, diagrams and educational books. Much of the most exciting French contemporary art is video- or internet-based. This is probably because French art schools are so suffocatingly dominated by old-schoolers that the only way young artists can establish autonomy is by working in new media. That is not to say that French contemporary sculpture, for example, is not interesting: Claude Leveque's intriguing work, which can be seen at the Glasgow Project Room from Saturday onwards, is particularly exciting since it uses neon light installations to produce an uncanny and very contemporary beauty.

      "body": "<p>I first visited Las Vegas in 1988. In the heat of the desert city, I was holed up in the Convention Centre for a week, modelling fur coats. In its own way, my brief sojourn was a reflection of the contradictions that make Las Vegas what it is - a city where Siberian fur is modelled in 90 degrees of heat and where gay bars exist alongside shops selling Catholic iconography. It's a city of plunging necklines and rhinestone crucifixes, where night becomes day in 24-hour casinos and where clocks are rarer than a sunny day in London. </p> <p>When Christopher Bruce recently asked me to choreograph a piece for Rambert Dance Company, of which he is artistic director, my travels in Vegas came back to haunt me. America has been a constant theme in my work over the past few years and I have been particularly inspired by the lyrical writings of Tennessee Williams. I was keen to see if the universal human truths that Williams addresses in his work had found a place in arguably America's most manufactured and made-over city. </p> <p>And so, Vegas found its way into The Celebrated Soubrette - my new piece for Rambert. In Michael Daugherty's clever, witty score, Le Tombeau de Liberace, I found a voice for my musings. </p> <p>I wanted to choreograph something unapologetically grand and at times tragic. Daugherty's music, and the man it was inspired by - a one-man walking Las Vegas - fitted the bill perfectly. One image seemed to stick in my mind: what would the atmosphere have been like if Williams had actually met Liberace? </p> <p>This potentially disastrous chemical cocktail became the starting point for The Celebrated Soubrette. Las Vegas provided the heat which would bring the mixture to the boil. In an attempt to capture the essence of the city and inject this fantasy with some stark reality, I made a two-day visit to Las Vegas earlier this year. </p> <p><strong> Day 1</strong><br> </p> <p>Much has changed in Las Vegas over the past 10 years. On my first visit, I landed in the desert. Today, the airport is just off Vegas's central strip. A huge shimmering pyramid rises into the sky. This is my hotel. </p> <p><strong>4am: </strong>I'm jet-lagged. I look out of my window. To my left are replicas of the Empire State and Chrysler buildings. Straight ahead is a pastel recreation of Camelot. The Eiffel Tower is just around the corner. </p> <p> <strong> 6am: </strong>Breakfast. The Luxor is probably the only hotel in the world where you breakfast in the midst of a full-scale archaeological excavation (although the \"artefacts\" bear an uncanny, if fractured, resemblance to the kitsch \"Egyptian\" statues in the casino). \"Hi, I'm Linda. What can I dig for you?\" asks my waitress. </p> <p> <strong> 8am: </strong>I meet up with James P Reza, editor of the Time Out Guide to Las Vegas and that rare breed in the city - a native Las Vegan. Our first stop is the Glass Pool Inn, one of Vegas's few remaining 1950s buildings. It's a style of architecture that I am particularly drawn to. </p> <p>Much of my work relates to the creation and destruction of geometric shapes. Similar themes run through the carved curves of these elegant, strangely futuristic edifices. Over the past 10 years, the original 1950s Las Vegas casinos have largely been \"imploded\", and only a small number of motels and even fewer original bars remain. I ask James why this is. \"They don't make money,\" he replies. In their place now stand modern buildings masquerading as ancient or classical architecture (but with added fairy lights and a shorter shelf life). </p> <p><strong>Lunchtime: </strong>I'm at the Liberace Museum. \"Do you like my costume? You should. You paid for it.\" Liberace knew which side his bread was buttered and a visit to his museum only confirms that while he knew what money could buy, he never forgot who put it in his pocket. Diamond jewels are displayed side-by-side with small throw-away china dogs; a gold encrusted piano shares the stage with one made by a fan from 200,000 toothpicks. </p> <p>I spot a photograph of a poster advertising an early show starring Liberace and the \"voice of Barbra Streisand\". Liberace supposedly said of her that \"what she hadn't discovered about showbusiness was the value of glamour. It almost seems as if she'd never even heard the word.\" I find myself warming to the man even more. We are met by the new curator of the Liberace Museum, 25-year-old anthropologist Brian Paco Alvarez. Paco (whose motto is \"It's not just a label, it's an idea\") shows us behind the scenes. Paco's enthusiasm for Liberace is purely personal - he used to see him shopping as a child and Liberace always said \"Hi\". His mother couldn't be more pleased if Paco had become President. </p> <p>But, all is not well at the Liberace Museum. Brian's predecessor has left things in quite a state. Some of Liberace's precious costumes are stored in the bathroom. I take an exclusive pee in Liberace's personal toilet and note that clearly his love of candelabras was not just a stage act. On my way out, I buy a moving-image pen. Liberace floats in a dream car between two candelabras as I write. </p> <p><strong>Evening: </strong>Like the 50s architecture, old-fashioned Las Vegas showgirls are a dying breed. Those still working look like they've been at it a long time. I decide to head for Bally's Casino to see Jubilee! There are two shows each evening: the midnight show is topless; at 9.30pm, the girls tie a bit of sparkly ribbon across their top half. </p> <p>I decide to be daring and go for the late show. And, what a show. The sinking of the Titanic, complete with rictus smiles, lingerie and a high-kicking American Pie finale has the woman next to me in tears. The effects are fantastic, but beneath the sparkles, you can see that for these women, its just a job. I wonder what will happen to them when Jubilee's lights go out forever? </p> <p><strong> Day 2</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> 3am: </strong>Time to get up. The same people are in the same position in the timeless casino. </p> <p> <strong> 10am: </strong>We head out for the desert, which puts Vegas into sharp focus. Tennessee Williams said: \"We are all of us sentenced to solitary confinement inside our own skin, for life!\" I realise that this could apply as strongly to Vegas itself - a floating island in a sea of dust - as to any living person. </p> <p> <strong> Lunchtime: </strong> Shopping at The Forum mall at Caesar's Palace. At the Gucci roman temple, I'm short on cash and time. \"Don't worry,\" says the shop assistant, \"everything will still be here when you come back from the casino.\" Money talks in Vegas, but I suppose it's consoling to know that if you don't have any, your fortune could just be a slot machine away. </p> <p> <strong> Evening: </strong>I meet up with James P Reza and his girlfriend Stacey. I'd given up hope of finding anything of Williams's spirit in Vegas, and then in walks Stacey. She used to be stripper, but is now setting up as a hairdresser. She stripped because she loved it and recently fulfilled her adolescent fantasy of stripping on New Orleans' Bourbon Street. The name of her chosen bar? Big Daddy's (after Brick's father in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof). </p> <p>Stacey is smart, sexy, seemingly frail but tough as nails - the quintessential Williams heroine - and she's sitting opposite me. This is what I've been looking for. She's my celebrated soubrette, and I'm dying to tell the Rambert dancers. Time to go home. </p> <p>\u0095 Rambert Dance Company's The Celebrated Soubrette is at Sadler's Wells, London EC1 (020 7863 8000) from November 21-25 and the Plymouth Theatre Royal (01752 267 222) from November 29 to December 2. A documentary by Matthew Springford on the making of The Celebrated Soubrette will be shown on Artsworld - a new digital channel - on Christmas Eve</p>",

Stacey is smart, sexy, seemingly frail but tough as nails - the quintessential Williams heroine - and she's sitting opposite me. This is what I've been looking for. She's my celebrated soubrette, and I'm dying to tell the Rambert dancers. Time to go home. \u0095 Rambert Dance Company's The Celebrated Soubrette is at Sadler's Wells, London EC1 (020 7863 8000) from November 21-25 and the Plymouth Theatre Royal (01752 267 222) from November 29 to December 2. A documentary by Matthew Springford on the making of The Celebrated Soubrette will be shown on Artsworld - a new digital channel - on Christmas Eve",

Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has poached JP Morgan's vice-president of media relations, Alexander Northcott. The intimate details of lobbying contracts involving members of the House of Lords are to be laid bare under proposals made by Lord Neill. Financial Dynamics chief executive Nick Miles is to head a new global investor relations and corporate communications brand, launched this week by parent company Cordiant Communications Group. Sally Osman has been appointed to the top dedicated PR post at the BBC. The general public believes public relations officers to be more trustworthy than journalists. Clark's, the high street shoe retailer, has ditched its two retained corporate and fashion PR agencies as part of a communications overhaul. Charlotte Church, the Welsh teenage soprano, has hired Henry's House to handle personality PR. The Tobacco Manufacturers Association is looking for a new PR agency after Edelman PR Worldwide decided not to repitch for the account. Corporate and financial agency Citigate Dewe Rogerson has denied industry rumours that its deputy chairman and international MD are leaving to launch a rival agency. The communications industry has reacted strongly to the New Economics Foundation's claims that social reporting is corporate spin. Rising numbers of public relations officers are leaving staff jobs to go freelance.

Meanwhile in West Palm Beach, the centre of attempts to re-examine last week's election, Democrats who said they were confused by a new ballot design into voting against vice-president Al Gore won a ruling that could lead to a wider recount of votes than expected. Broward county, between Miami and Palm Beach county, said it would reassess 564,000 ballots in the overwhelmingly Democratic area. \"We're in uncharted waters, in a legal perspective,\" said Sam Goren, a lawyer advising the elections supervisor Jane Carroll. The switch, which is good news for Mr Gore - officially 300 votes behind George W Bush - was made in the face of a lawsuit filed by the Democratic party. The recount, if it goes ahead, is expected to take at least a week. Broward's canvassing board met the Tuesday evening deadline, in common with Florida's other 66 counties, but only after a partial recount that gave Mr Gore another seven votes. This was ascertained by taking another look at 3,892 ballots in three precincts. On Monday officials decided this suggested a county-wide recount would be of little value and so ruled it out, on Tuesday they talked about reconsidering, and yesterday they decided to go for the manual recount. Meanwhile Mr Gore edged another step forward in his efforts to gather enough votes to defeat Mr Bush in Florida when the judge in West Palm Beach said election officials in Palm Beach county could include the celebrated \"dimpled chad\" voting papers in their recounts. Judge Jorge Labarga said officials should not automatically throw out all ballot papers in which the hole next to a voter's presidential choice was not completely punched through. Instead, officials could decide whether to accept a ballot paper in which the box next to the candidate's name was clearly indented, even though no hole had been made - the so-called \"dimpled chads\". \"No vote is to be declared invalid or void if there was a clear intention of the voter,\" Judge Labarga ruled after a 90-minute hearing. The ruling means several thousand previously rejected ballot papers may now be included in any manual recount of the 462,000 votes cast in the presidential ballot in Palm Beach county. The Palm Beach hand recount had been scheduled to begin at 7am yesterday, but it was suspended while the county's election board members went to court for the judge's ruling. \"We decided we would wait because we need clear direction on what to do,\" said Charles Burton, chairman of the local canvassing board which supervises elections in the county. \"On the one hand we're trying to move forward, on the other it almost seems to be musical courts. We're going from the next courtroom to the next courtroom to the next courtroom.\" Democrats had also hoped that a hand count in Florida's largest county, Miami-Dade, would give Mr Gore a clear lead in the state but this looked yesterday to be where there was least likely to be any movement. Officials ran a manual recount there of 5,871 ballots in three heavily pro-Democratic precincts and found another six votes for Mr Gore. This, the Miami-Dade canvassing board decided by a two-one vote, did not justify a hand count across the county. \"I don't believe the changes I saw in the votes warrant us going any further,\" said David Leahy, the county elections supervisor. Democrats were still considering a legal challenge to the decision. \"We think they're wrong,\" said Kendall Coffey, a lawyer for the party. There was no immediate legal dispute about the clarity of the ballots in Miami-Dade but still about 17,000 cards had more than one punch for president and another 10,000 had none. In another development, it emerged yesterday that 16 of the 67 counties that submitted certified recount figures to Tallahassee by Tuesday evening's deadline did not recount every vote.

Jon Howes is building a boat designed not merely to push back the cavitation barrier but to smash right through it. Its key feature is a single water foil, which is enough; for example a dinghy without a rudder can be sailed, even to windward, by backing the jib to turn it into a stabiliser. </p> <p>Mr Howes's boat has a more conventional wing and tailplane acting as a sail, attached to the foil by a long crossbeam from which is suspended the hull carrying the lone pilot.

Surface air, rushing down the suction side of the foil. Ventilation, it is called, and for most sailors it is a dirty word even more than cavitation because it too destroys lift and it occurs at much lower speeds. But Mr Howes lets it happen. </p> <p>The fences that the current generation of fast sailing boats rely on to keep ventilation at bay would be merely a drag on this boat. The foil is not as efficient at low speeds as foils with a conventional section and fences, but there is likely to be no further loss of lift when it reaches the cavitation zone. The foil still loses all its lift on occasions, notably when it clears the water in a wave trough, but then it simply skips sideways and is rolled into a subsequent wave. </p> <p>So this boat, like the wind surfers, can survive in waves and a blow, one criterion for record-breaking. However, it belongs emphatically in a different category of boats, those designed to break records because high lift/low drag enables them to go several times faster than the wind. </p> <p>That being so, there is a fundamental question: can a boat with such a foil, producing three times as much drag for the same lift as a conventional foil, possibly achieve the lift-drag ratio it needs? </p> <p>Howes's mathematical modelling and tow-tests suggest it can, because of clean air shape and minimal underwater surfaces; and he has built small models, with a 30-inch wingsail, which have done twice the speed of the wind despite scale effects, notably the relative immensity of waves. Mr Howes is expecting much better than that from the boat that will carry him across Portland Harbour's measured course next September; he is building it strong enough to withstand 100 knots (yes, 115mph). </p> <p> H e does not say it will go that fast. \"I would only claim that the speed you get is as fast as it will go; there are simply too many variables to be absolutely confident.\" But, unlike some sheer-speed boats, it can sail on either tack, and it may be suitable for the wide oceans. </p> <p>\"Although I did not originally believe that this boat would be any more than a sprinter for record attempts on sheltered water, it is is becoming increasingly clear that it is very stable and has a very high tolerance to waves, even before the hull flies,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I now believe that it could be built larger and be perfectly capable of racing on the open sea with probably better seaworthiness than some current multihulls.\" </p> <p>But, given that well-sponsored British designers have recently produced far more conventional boats that have proved to be turkeys - can't swim, can't fly - why should we believe this still unsponsored effort is different? </p> <p>After all, any gathering of speed sailing enthusiasts will feature numerous eccentric amateurs with their world-beaters, many of which do not even get into the water. But Mr Howes, 41, is a professional. No, not a boat-design professional; he works as a structures and aerodynamics specialist for the Civil Aviation Authority at Gatwick, where he is head of loads and dynamics. However, the fastest boat of the future will be bird not fish.

H e does not say it will go that fast. \"I would only claim that the speed you get is as fast as it will go; there are simply too many variables to be absolutely confident.\" But, unlike some sheer-speed boats, it can sail on either tack, and it may be suitable for the wide oceans. \"Although I did not originally believe that this boat would be any more than a sprinter for record attempts on sheltered water, it is is becoming increasingly clear that it is very stable and has a very high tolerance to waves, even before the hull flies,\" he says. \"I now believe that it could be built larger and be perfectly capable of racing on the open sea with probably better seaworthiness than some current multihulls.\" But, given that well-sponsored British designers have recently produced far more conventional boats that have proved to be turkeys - can't swim, can't fly - why should we believe this still unsponsored effort is different? After all, any gathering of speed sailing enthusiasts will feature numerous eccentric amateurs with their world-beaters, many of which do not even get into the water. But Mr Howes, 41, is a professional. No, not a boat-design professional; he works as a structures and aerodynamics specialist for the Civil Aviation Authority at Gatwick, where he is head of loads and dynamics. However, the fastest boat of the future will be bird not fish. As he says of his invention: \"Think slow aircraft, not fast boat.\" www.speedsailing.com/boats_jons_boat.htm",

Some of it seems to encourage people to be dishonest when it comes to dealing with their employer. </p> <p>I work in the public sector and surfing the internet for porn and displaying it in the office does not sit comfortably with standards of behaviour expected from staff. <br><strong> David Wyatt</strong><br><a href=\"mailto:d.wyatt@btinternet.com\">d.wyatt@btinternet.com</a> </p> <p>\"How dull office life would be without Solitaire and Minesweeper,\" twitters Richard Adams. Maybe life in the Guardian office is so insufferably dreary that you need mindless distractions, but in that case you should look for a more stimulating job. I'm sick of Online's repeated (and repetitious) articles supporting employees who steal time and resources from their companies.

Some of it seems to encourage people to be dishonest when it comes to dealing with their employer. I work in the public sector and surfing the internet for porn and displaying it in the office does not sit comfortably with standards of behaviour expected from staff. David Wyatt d.wyatt@btinternet.com \"How dull office life would be without Solitaire and Minesweeper,\" twitters Richard Adams. Maybe life in the Guardian office is so insufferably dreary that you need mindless distractions, but in that case you should look for a more stimulating job. I'm sick of Online's repeated (and repetitious) articles supporting employees who steal time and resources from their companies.

      "bodyText": "The BBC's decision to schedule Sir David Attenborough's latest epic production against the final episode of Inspector Morse last night proved a ratings disaster. State of the Planet, the \u00a32m millennium special that has been two years in the making, was watched by just 4m viewers - 16% of the audience. As expected, the final ever episode of Inspector Morse was the night's number one show. The spectacle of the increasingly curmudgeonly policeman expiring just as he is about crack a crime had the nation enthralled, pulling in 12.6m - one in two viewers. The hype surrounding Morse's death left the BBC with one of its worst ever peak-time shares. Throughout the night it barely managed to muster more than 4m viewers. Tomorrow's World in Venice at 7pm pulled in 4.3m, followed by Car Wars, which got 4.2m. Lowri Turner managed to lose 100,000 of the audience with her DIY SOS show but they returned to BBC1 by the time the lottery came on at 8.30pm. At this point, the time Inspector Morse began on ITV, the BBC didn't lose a single viewer. But it didn't gain any either. The lottery got 4.2m viewers as did a repeat of Only Fools and Horses. The 10 O'Clock News fared worst with just 3.6m viewers. That BBC1 controller Lorraine Heggessey scheduled Sir David's much-anticipated three-part series against one of ITV's biggest ever drama series has surprised many. However, Ms Heggessey defended her channel's performance, saying: \"BBC1 is always going to have important, landmark series like State of the Planet which are there for their public purpose, not for ratings. \"We are thrilled the programme did so well.\" Nevertheless ITV must be relishing the prospect of another ratings battle in two weeks' time when State of the Planet will face one of the network's biggest nights of the year - Coronation Street followed by a David Beckham documentary, Who Wants to be a Millionaire? and the TV premiere of The Full Monty.",

Where could be more appropriate than the New Zealand towns of Napier and Havelock North?</p> <p>When my colleague Richard Adams calls his homeland to do the deal, the signs are mixed. \"The mayor, Alan Dick, is looking into it at the moment,\" says his PA Sandra Svendsen in Napier (pop 55,000). \"I just phoned the British high commission to get the name of the new lord mayor of London.\"</p> <p>Over at Havelock North, regional mayor Jeremy Dwyer takes a more Livingstonian line. \"I am not particularly interested,\" he says, perhaps reckoning that Havelock's involvement of the brutal suppression the Indian mutiny in 1857 makes him the sort of colonial oppressor New Zealand is loath to commemorate. Never mind, if we can get old Napier off on the boat, that's a start.</p> <p>\u0095 To hear Stephen Pound, the cheeky chappie MP for Ealing and arch Mr Tony loyalist, rabbiting away (\"rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit\" as Chas and Dave put it, \"rabbit, rabbit, rabbit\") on the radio, you'd think he was born in the backroom of a pie and mash shop down Lambeth way.</p> <p>Would you believe it, though, it seems the brogue may be misleading. It certainly wasn't picked up from his father, the splendidly named Pelham Pound, whom acquaintances remember as more Alvar Liddell than Jamie Oliver.</p> <p>A fringe player in the Profumo scandal (he was Steven Ward's \"agent\") Pelham died not long ago after spending his final years as a journalist with BBC radio. Which is where we heard Steve on Friday night. Such symmetry.</p> <p>\u0095 A most intriguing document reaches us. It is on the headed notepaper of Bernard Matthews plc (head office: Great Witchingham Hall, Norwich). \"To whom it may concern,\" it begins. \"This letter is to confirm that the above individual is an employee of Bernard Matthews plc.\"</p> <p>After explaining that the firm's business is poultry rearing and distribution, it goes on: \"Accordingly this employee should be entitled to claim fuel as a priority user.\" It almost seems shame now that there won't be any trouble at the pumps, just for the pleasure of seeing men and women waving live turkeys around and shouting \"essential national business\" as they tried in vain to jump the queue.</p> <p>\u0095 Sue Thorne writes from Piccadilly inviting us to an event tonight. \"The directors of the Prudential are pleased to announce a celebratory switching on of the Christmas lights in Burlington Arcade, by Boris Johnson, the editor of the Spectator.\"</p> <p>Well strike me. When we call Boris, his phone is answered by an Arthur Mullard sound-alike. What's all this about your guv'nor turning on the lights? \"If I were you, pal, I'd be more worried about the guv'nor turning yer lights out,\" says the man, chortling. \"Now be a good boy, run along and stop pulling me bell end.\"</p> <p>\u0095 A court in the South African capital Pretoria heard that marriage guidance counsellor Dr Cedric Wayne, who had been treating an embattled couple, became so furious with the wife's continual nagging that he leapt out of his chair and helped the husband beat her up.</p> <p>After Tanya MacCauley was taken to hospital with concussion, a broken collarbone and fractured ribs, he and Bill MacCauley face assault charges. \"She's the most annoying woman I've ever met and no husband should be subjected to nagging like that,\" Dr Wayne told police. \"A counsellor isn't supposed to take sides, but she drove me crazy.

When my colleague Richard Adams calls his homeland to do the deal, the signs are mixed. \"The mayor, Alan Dick, is looking into it at the moment,\" says his PA Sandra Svendsen in Napier (pop 55,000). \"I just phoned the British high commission to get the name of the new lord mayor of London.\" Over at Havelock North, regional mayor Jeremy Dwyer takes a more Livingstonian line. \"I am not particularly interested,\" he says, perhaps reckoning that Havelock's involvement of the brutal suppression the Indian mutiny in 1857 makes him the sort of colonial oppressor New Zealand is loath to commemorate. Never mind, if we can get old Napier off on the boat, that's a start. \u0095 To hear Stephen Pound, the cheeky chappie MP for Ealing and arch Mr Tony loyalist, rabbiting away (\"rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit\" as Chas and Dave put it, \"rabbit, rabbit, rabbit\") on the radio, you'd think he was born in the backroom of a pie and mash shop down Lambeth way. Would you believe it, though, it seems the brogue may be misleading. It certainly wasn't picked up from his father, the splendidly named Pelham Pound, whom acquaintances remember as more Alvar Liddell than Jamie Oliver. A fringe player in the Profumo scandal (he was Steven Ward's \"agent\") Pelham died not long ago after spending his final years as a journalist with BBC radio. Which is where we heard Steve on Friday night. Such symmetry. \u0095 A most intriguing document reaches us. It is on the headed notepaper of Bernard Matthews plc (head office: Great Witchingham Hall, Norwich). \"To whom it may concern,\" it begins. \"This letter is to confirm that the above individual is an employee of Bernard Matthews plc.\" After explaining that the firm's business is poultry rearing and distribution, it goes on: \"Accordingly this employee should be entitled to claim fuel as a priority user.\" It almost seems shame now that there won't be any trouble at the pumps, just for the pleasure of seeing men and women waving live turkeys around and shouting \"essential national business\" as they tried in vain to jump the queue. \u0095 Sue Thorne writes from Piccadilly inviting us to an event tonight. \"The directors of the Prudential are pleased to announce a celebratory switching on of the Christmas lights in Burlington Arcade, by Boris Johnson, the editor of the Spectator.\" Well strike me. When we call Boris, his phone is answered by an Arthur Mullard sound-alike. What's all this about your guv'nor turning on the lights? \"If I were you, pal, I'd be more worried about the guv'nor turning yer lights out,\" says the man, chortling. \"Now be a good boy, run along and stop pulling me bell end.\" \u0095 A court in the South African capital Pretoria heard that marriage guidance counsellor Dr Cedric Wayne, who had been treating an embattled couple, became so furious with the wife's continual nagging that he leapt out of his chair and helped the husband beat her up. After Tanya MacCauley was taken to hospital with concussion, a broken collarbone and fractured ribs, he and Bill MacCauley face assault charges. \"She's the most annoying woman I've ever met and no husband should be subjected to nagging like that,\" Dr Wayne told police. \"A counsellor isn't supposed to take sides, but she drove me crazy. I have no regrets.\" diary@theguardian.com",

They branded his speech a \"cheap, thoughtless side-swipe\". Ian Twinn, a director of the Incorporated Society of British Advertisers, said he was horrified that the man in charge of Britain's economy could make such damaging comments about one of the country's biggest industries. \"It's just not the sort of thing the chancellor can go around saying,\" said Mr Twinn. \"He has jumped on this passing bandwagon and is trying to make political capital out of it.\" Mr Brown made his controversial comments at the launch of a new fund to help children from disadvantaged backgrounds. The chancellor said he was struck by how unfair it was that thousands of children got the Christmas presents they wanted while others watched TV ads knowing they could never afford the products advertised. But Mr Twinn said that advertising played a crucial role in encouraging young people to set their aspirations high.

      "body": "<p>Rate hawks are becoming an endangered species on both sides of the Atlantic. City analysts, who a few months ago were confidently predicting that borrowing costs could rise as high as 7.5%, are now hastily backtracking. </p> <p>A raft of weak data appears to have convinced even the most paranoid analysts that inflation is not likely to threaten the government's 2.5% target anytime soon. This week's figures - the first rise in unemployment for nearly two years and the lowest service sector inflation for 2 years - only confirm the trend. </p> <p>This morning's quarterly inflation forecast from the Bank of England is expected to confirm the newly fashionable view. A below target forecast today should help persuade the last remaining doubters that after keeping rates on hold at 6% since February, the next move by the Bank's monetary policy committee will be to cut rates. </p> <p>Meanwhile, most US fund managers believe Alan Greenspan has guided the mighty American economy to a soft landing and that his next move will be to cut borrowing costs. The Federal Reserve was still warning about inflation risks when it announced its decision to keep rates on hold last night, but some analysts believe rates could be cut by Christmas. Successful soft landings are rare achievements. If the Fed and the Bank of England have simultaneously engineered one, the coincidence is even rarer. </p> <p>The risk now could be on the down side. Some economists warn that the trebling of oil prices since the start of 1999 will inevitably lead to a collapse in growth in the industrialised world. For all the hype about the arrival of weightless economies, generating wealth from computer code and ideas, Britain and America are still powered by oil. </p> <p><strong> Out of the blue </strong><br> </p> <p>Glaxo Wellcome slipped out a statement yesterday, saying it had won approval from America's Food and Drug Administration for Trizivir, a triple combination tablet for treating HIV. </p> <p>The news had been expected. Like other potions pitched against life-threatening diseases, Trizivir has enjoyed \"accelerated approval\" status from drug regulators. The European Union, for example, should give the thumbs up by early next year. So there was no detectable City reaction to the news. The shares failed to fly. Financial followers are still just sitting around waiting for the Glaxo/SmithKline merger to solidify (or dissolve). </p> <p>Yet Trizivir marks another milestone in the extraordinarily successful challenge to Aids funded by the world's major pharmaceutical firms as they chased therapies for what initially looked like a disease of the developed world, centred in the world's richest market for drugs. </p> <p>The drug companies cracked how to suppress the virus some years ago now, but the resultant cocktails had sufferers popping up to 30 tablets a day, all carefully or confusingly timed to be with or without food, water or whatever. Trizivir, on the other hand, is a straight twice-a-day pill, with no food or water restrictions. At $26-a-day, it will prolong many lives, and it should be in US pharmacies by December. </p> <p>Of course the developing world will have to await a while longer. For all the years of talking about so-called preferential pricing, aimed at helping the nations of Africa in particular to fight Aids, it seems that the first country under the programme - Senegal - was only signed up two weeks ago by Merck, Glaxo, Boehringer and Bristol Myers Squibb. </p> <p>Compared with its neighbours, the country is said to be well advanced in terms of logistics and economic-cum-political will, but agreement still took seven months of negotiation. </p> <p>Which is where we might drag in Gordon Brown, in the wake of last week's pre-Budget address, when he said he wanted an urgent review of how incentives, such as tax breaks, might speed vaccines for the world's killer diseases. </p> <p>Yet the chancellor's statement seems to have come completely out of the blue to the big drug firms. No doubt they would be quite happy to pocket subsidies from the British government to ship their products to the sub-Sahara, but it seems strange that there was no consultation in advance. </p> <p><strong> Right stock </strong><br> </p> <p>It is surprising that Bank of Scotland appears so determined that it should not be run by Ian Harley, the chief executive of Abbey, given that Mr Harley appears to possess one of the main characteristics necessary for admission to the BoS board: Scottishness. </p> <p>Every member of the BoS board, which contains the usual sprinkling of Sirs and Lords, was born in Scotland. So was Mr Harley, in Falkirk to be precise. </p> <p>In an attempt to show its diversity, BoS pointed out yesterday that three members of its board do at least work outside Scotland, as far afield as England, no less. Clearly, a demonstration of its ambition to be \"nationwide\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rate hawks are becoming an endangered species on both sides of the Atlantic. City analysts, who a few months ago were confidently predicting that borrowing costs could rise as high as 7.5%, are now hastily backtracking. A raft of weak data appears to have convinced even the most paranoid analysts that inflation is not likely to threaten the government's 2.5% target anytime soon. This week's figures - the first rise in unemployment for nearly two years and the lowest service sector inflation for 2 years - only confirm the trend. This morning's quarterly inflation forecast from the Bank of England is expected to confirm the newly fashionable view. A below target forecast today should help persuade the last remaining doubters that after keeping rates on hold at 6% since February, the next move by the Bank's monetary policy committee will be to cut rates. Meanwhile, most US fund managers believe Alan Greenspan has guided the mighty American economy to a soft landing and that his next move will be to cut borrowing costs. The Federal Reserve was still warning about inflation risks when it announced its decision to keep rates on hold last night, but some analysts believe rates could be cut by Christmas. Successful soft landings are rare achievements. If the Fed and the Bank of England have simultaneously engineered one, the coincidence is even rarer. The risk now could be on the down side. Some economists warn that the trebling of oil prices since the start of 1999 will inevitably lead to a collapse in growth in the industrialised world. For all the hype about the arrival of weightless economies, generating wealth from computer code and ideas, Britain and America are still powered by oil. Out of the blue Glaxo Wellcome slipped out a statement yesterday, saying it had won approval from America's Food and Drug Administration for Trizivir, a triple combination tablet for treating HIV. The news had been expected. Like other potions pitched against life-threatening diseases, Trizivir has enjoyed \"accelerated approval\" status from drug regulators. The European Union, for example, should give the thumbs up by early next year. So there was no detectable City reaction to the news. The shares failed to fly. Financial followers are still just sitting around waiting for the Glaxo/SmithKline merger to solidify (or dissolve). Yet Trizivir marks another milestone in the extraordinarily successful challenge to Aids funded by the world's major pharmaceutical firms as they chased therapies for what initially looked like a disease of the developed world, centred in the world's richest market for drugs. The drug companies cracked how to suppress the virus some years ago now, but the resultant cocktails had sufferers popping up to 30 tablets a day, all carefully or confusingly timed to be with or without food, water or whatever. Trizivir, on the other hand, is a straight twice-a-day pill, with no food or water restrictions. At $26-a-day, it will prolong many lives, and it should be in US pharmacies by December. Of course the developing world will have to await a while longer. For all the years of talking about so-called preferential pricing, aimed at helping the nations of Africa in particular to fight Aids, it seems that the first country under the programme - Senegal - was only signed up two weeks ago by Merck, Glaxo, Boehringer and Bristol Myers Squibb. Compared with its neighbours, the country is said to be well advanced in terms of logistics and economic-cum-political will, but agreement still took seven months of negotiation. Which is where we might drag in Gordon Brown, in the wake of last week's pre-Budget address, when he said he wanted an urgent review of how incentives, such as tax breaks, might speed vaccines for the world's killer diseases. Yet the chancellor's statement seems to have come completely out of the blue to the big drug firms. No doubt they would be quite happy to pocket subsidies from the British government to ship their products to the sub-Sahara, but it seems strange that there was no consultation in advance. Right stock It is surprising that Bank of Scotland appears so determined that it should not be run by Ian Harley, the chief executive of Abbey, given that Mr Harley appears to possess one of the main characteristics necessary for admission to the BoS board: Scottishness. Every member of the BoS board, which contains the usual sprinkling of Sirs and Lords, was born in Scotland. So was Mr Harley, in Falkirk to be precise. In an attempt to show its diversity, BoS pointed out yesterday that three members of its board do at least work outside Scotland, as far afield as England, no less. Clearly, a demonstration of its ambition to be \"nationwide\".",

      "body": "<p>Wiring our bodies to the internet might sound like the stuff of science fiction, but the reality of such a far-flung idea is closer than you think. </p> <p>A number of companies have this year been touting wearable computers as the next big thing. We've had fully mounted headsets, scarves that alert users to email and, ironically enough, anoraks with built-in PCs. But rising concern for our health - rather than our looks - is most likely to create a market for such products. </p> <p>In both the United States and Scandinavia, a number of technology companies, ranging from small start-ups to telecommunications giants and even global sportswear manufacturers, are ready to release a range of wireless internet devices that can either be worn or even directly connected to the body. And as early as next spring, they could be coming to the United Kingdom. </p> <p>By 2010, Forrester Research predicts, a billion people will access the net through some kind of wireless device. This means at least a third of the UK population will have wireless access. The majority of these devices will probably be advanced third generation (3G) mobile phones. But analysts believe the number will include fridges, washing machines and alarm clocks with wireless access. Devices that monitor the body's vital signs could well carve out a slice of the wireless pie. </p> <p>The race to wire the body began in earnest last August when <a href=\"http://www.lifechart.com\" target=\"_new\">LifeChart</a>, a $25m start-up, released a product for asthma sufferers called the AirWatch, a small electronic inhaler with a tiny LCD display. It enables users to regularly monitor their breathing. But what is really interesting is the web-enabled services run off the device. </p> <p>By plugging the AirWatch into the nearest telephone socket, users can upload all their recorded data to the company's website. LifeChart converts the data into a series of graphs and tables that help users spot the \"triggers\" that might be causing their disease. </p> <p>LifeChart charges $120 per year subscription fee. Subscribers are invited to share their password with their doctors. The company, based in California and funded by Johnson &amp; Johnson, Nokia and the Finnish National Fund For Research and Development, offers similar devices and services for heart disease sufferers and diabetics. The service is available across the US and in Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands. </p> <p>LifeChart calls this service \"connecting people to constant care\", and sees itself as part of a wider \"wellness management\" industry burgeoning in the US. </p> <p>Rivals include <a href=\"http://www.Stayhealthy.com\" target=\"_new\">Stayhealthy.com</a>, which offers customers a device called the CT1 personal calorie tracker. It looks a bit like a pager and allows users to monitor their caloric burn rate by measuring and recording body movement. Unlike the AirWatch, the CT1 is worn on the waist and constantly tracks caloric burn throughout the day. Using a docking station and special software the data is uploaded to the Stayhealthy web site. </p> <p>Another US company, <a href=\"http://www.Microfit.com\" target=\"_new\">Microfit</a>, has for years been offering online services that connect an exercise bike to a PC, but Bodymedia, a start-up in Pittsburgh, wants to go one better and wire you and your mountain bike to the net. </p> <p>\"Just like a dieter needs a set of scales to lose weight, so a busy professional seeking a structure of wellness to their lives needs a tool to bring that about,\" says Astro Teller, the chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.Bodymedia\" target=\"_new\">Bodymedia</a>. Next spring sees the launch of Sensewear - a series of sensors to monitor the human body in ways that are \"fashionable and comfortable\". </p> <p> Sensewear monitors heart rate, skin temperature and even how well you are sleeping. Again, the information is transmitted to a PC and uploaded to a secure server - this time wirelessly. The system is similar to that used by athletes at the Olympics to monitor their training. But Bodymedia claims that eventually it will be able to download information to users. Suddenly, you can be told how well you are doing, when to get up, when to eat, even when to meditate. </p> <p>Last month, Bodymedia launched its Healthmanager software that will run off Sensewear. For now, users will be expected to input their own data (indeed the health manager will run without Sensewear). There is an initial set-up fee of $25 and a further $50 a month subscription fee for the service. </p> <p>\"Bodymedia is not offering a quick fix or the next fad diet,\" insists Teller. \"We will not replace your doctor or personal trainer or any other health professional. </p> <p>\"Rather, we wish to help you accomplish your goal and bring a health balance to your lifestyle.\" </p> <p>Teller says that initally remote database access (RDA) technology, or cellphone networks, will be employed. He thinks that Sensewear is best suited to Bluetooth - a consortium of five companies (Nokia, Ericsson, IBM, Intel and Toshiba) - which is developing a specification to allow wireless devices to communicate with each other. But he admits that this is at least \"three or four years away\". </p> <p>Hot on Bodymedia's heels is Nike. The sportswear manufacturer is facing falling sales of training shoes (last year's profits were barely half that of 1997), and looking to diversify into a number of computer-related products. </p> <p>Nike rolled out its first MP3 player last month. The psa[play is developed in collaboration with Rio and is the first product to come out of Nike's high-tech research-and -development department, Techlab. </p> <p>The MP3 player will be followed by a pedometer and heart-rate monitor and, ultimately, the world's first online training shoe. </p> <p>Nike also wants to become a content provider by building a series of online communities based around the masses of data accrued from its work with Olympic athletes. At the moment this means something like their Olympic site, full of news, adverts for Nike sportswear and the odd chat room. But eventually - if Nike sells enough of their computer- related devices - it wants to offer customers the chance to compare their data with that of the athletes Nike sponsors. Suddenly you could compare your evening's jog with that of Olympians' Sonia O'Sullivan or John Brown. </p> <p>\"The beauty of it is that the more information we can offer the consumer about how they perform is going to make for a happier consumer,\" says Ray Riley, creative director of Techlab. \"And who better to integrate technology into the gear you wear for sport? It is perfect, it is like a business that is pre-made for us.\" </p> <p>And, says Riley, wiring the body need not prove prohibitively expensive. Nike's MP3 players start at \u00a3189, with the pedometers and heart-rate monitors expected to sell for a similar price. </p> <p>But should we wire up our bodies, even for health reasons? For many, Teller's vision of Bodymedia-clad workers being told what to do has sinister overtones. Couldn't insurance companies offer cheaper medical insurance to those that wire up? And what if, some time in the future, employers insist that their workers wear body media? </p> <p>Teller is scornful of such suggestions. He sees the growing scarcity of health-care as more reason for Bodymedia's success. In the US, he argues, how much you earn usually decides who receives healthcare, regardless of whether the rich have bothered to look after themselves. </p> <p>He says: \"Especially in a socialised medical society like Britain, it is certainly the case that one ought not to have to pay taxes for someone who didn't take care of themselves for 60 years and is going to be sick for the next 20.\" </p> <p>Therefore, he argues, use of Sensewear could help ascertain who has been looking after themselves and who would be most receptive to health care. </p> <p>Wearable computers are nothing new.

      "bodyText": "Wiring our bodies to the internet might sound like the stuff of science fiction, but the reality of such a far-flung idea is closer than you think. A number of companies have this year been touting wearable computers as the next big thing. We've had fully mounted headsets, scarves that alert users to email and, ironically enough, anoraks with built-in PCs. But rising concern for our health - rather than our looks - is most likely to create a market for such products. In both the United States and Scandinavia, a number of technology companies, ranging from small start-ups to telecommunications giants and even global sportswear manufacturers, are ready to release a range of wireless internet devices that can either be worn or even directly connected to the body. And as early as next spring, they could be coming to the United Kingdom. By 2010, Forrester Research predicts, a billion people will access the net through some kind of wireless device. This means at least a third of the UK population will have wireless access. The majority of these devices will probably be advanced third generation (3G) mobile phones. But analysts believe the number will include fridges, washing machines and alarm clocks with wireless access. Devices that monitor the body's vital signs could well carve out a slice of the wireless pie. The race to wire the body began in earnest last August when LifeChart, a $25m start-up, released a product for asthma sufferers called the AirWatch, a small electronic inhaler with a tiny LCD display. It enables users to regularly monitor their breathing. But what is really interesting is the web-enabled services run off the device. By plugging the AirWatch into the nearest telephone socket, users can upload all their recorded data to the company's website. LifeChart converts the data into a series of graphs and tables that help users spot the \"triggers\" that might be causing their disease. LifeChart charges $120 per year subscription fee. Subscribers are invited to share their password with their doctors. The company, based in California and funded by Johnson &amp; Johnson, Nokia and the Finnish National Fund For Research and Development, offers similar devices and services for heart disease sufferers and diabetics. The service is available across the US and in Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands. LifeChart calls this service \"connecting people to constant care\", and sees itself as part of a wider \"wellness management\" industry burgeoning in the US. Rivals include Stayhealthy.com, which offers customers a device called the CT1 personal calorie tracker. It looks a bit like a pager and allows users to monitor their caloric burn rate by measuring and recording body movement. Unlike the AirWatch, the CT1 is worn on the waist and constantly tracks caloric burn throughout the day. Using a docking station and special software the data is uploaded to the Stayhealthy web site. Another US company, Microfit, has for years been offering online services that connect an exercise bike to a PC, but Bodymedia, a start-up in Pittsburgh, wants to go one better and wire you and your mountain bike to the net. \"Just like a dieter needs a set of scales to lose weight, so a busy professional seeking a structure of wellness to their lives needs a tool to bring that about,\" says Astro Teller, the chief executive of Bodymedia. Next spring sees the launch of Sensewear - a series of sensors to monitor the human body in ways that are \"fashionable and comfortable\". Sensewear monitors heart rate, skin temperature and even how well you are sleeping. Again, the information is transmitted to a PC and uploaded to a secure server - this time wirelessly. The system is similar to that used by athletes at the Olympics to monitor their training. But Bodymedia claims that eventually it will be able to download information to users. Suddenly, you can be told how well you are doing, when to get up, when to eat, even when to meditate. Last month, Bodymedia launched its Healthmanager software that will run off Sensewear. For now, users will be expected to input their own data (indeed the health manager will run without Sensewear). There is an initial set-up fee of $25 and a further $50 a month subscription fee for the service. \"Bodymedia is not offering a quick fix or the next fad diet,\" insists Teller. \"We will not replace your doctor or personal trainer or any other health professional. \"Rather, we wish to help you accomplish your goal and bring a health balance to your lifestyle.\" Teller says that initally remote database access (RDA) technology, or cellphone networks, will be employed. He thinks that Sensewear is best suited to Bluetooth - a consortium of five companies (Nokia, Ericsson, IBM, Intel and Toshiba) - which is developing a specification to allow wireless devices to communicate with each other. But he admits that this is at least \"three or four years away\". Hot on Bodymedia's heels is Nike. The sportswear manufacturer is facing falling sales of training shoes (last year's profits were barely half that of 1997), and looking to diversify into a number of computer-related products. Nike rolled out its first MP3 player last month. The psa[play is developed in collaboration with Rio and is the first product to come out of Nike's high-tech research-and -development department, Techlab. The MP3 player will be followed by a pedometer and heart-rate monitor and, ultimately, the world's first online training shoe. Nike also wants to become a content provider by building a series of online communities based around the masses of data accrued from its work with Olympic athletes. At the moment this means something like their Olympic site, full of news, adverts for Nike sportswear and the odd chat room. But eventually - if Nike sells enough of their computer- related devices - it wants to offer customers the chance to compare their data with that of the athletes Nike sponsors. Suddenly you could compare your evening's jog with that of Olympians' Sonia O'Sullivan or John Brown. \"The beauty of it is that the more information we can offer the consumer about how they perform is going to make for a happier consumer,\" says Ray Riley, creative director of Techlab. \"And who better to integrate technology into the gear you wear for sport? It is perfect, it is like a business that is pre-made for us.\" And, says Riley, wiring the body need not prove prohibitively expensive. Nike's MP3 players start at \u00a3189, with the pedometers and heart-rate monitors expected to sell for a similar price. But should we wire up our bodies, even for health reasons? For many, Teller's vision of Bodymedia-clad workers being told what to do has sinister overtones. Couldn't insurance companies offer cheaper medical insurance to those that wire up? And what if, some time in the future, employers insist that their workers wear body media? Teller is scornful of such suggestions. He sees the growing scarcity of health-care as more reason for Bodymedia's success. In the US, he argues, how much you earn usually decides who receives healthcare, regardless of whether the rich have bothered to look after themselves. He says: \"Especially in a socialised medical society like Britain, it is certainly the case that one ought not to have to pay taxes for someone who didn't take care of themselves for 60 years and is going to be sick for the next 20.\" Therefore, he argues, use of Sensewear could help ascertain who has been looking after themselves and who would be most receptive to health care. Wearable computers are nothing new. Military, medical and industrial versions have existed for years. What is different about Sensewear or devices like the AirWatch and CT1 is that they will, for the first time, be mass-marketed and the first to be online. Finally, if we want to wire our bodies to the internet, won't this make us become a hybrid of man and machine - effectively cyborgs? The leading thinker in the field, the \"cyber-feminist\" Donna Haraway, said as long ago as 1997 that we were all already cyborgs. Through the use of commonplace products such as spectacles, pacemakers and pharmaceuticals we integrated ourselves with machines long ago - it is just that some of us have not yet realised what we are doing. So maybe wiring our bodies to the internet - and embracing all its advantages might not be such a great leap forward after all.

      "bodyText": "Vivendi, the French media and environmental services company, has posted a rise in revenues ahead of its \u00a366bn merger with Canada's Seagram. The group is best known in the UK for its media division, which includes the Canal Plus pay-TV operation and the Havas advertising group, but its biggest earners are its water treatment and energy operations. Vivendi said revenues for the nine months to December were E29.1bn (\u00a317.5bn), against E19.9bn (\u00a311.9bn) last year. The environment division contributed E18.8bn (\u00a311.8bn), with the media arm's E9.4bn (\u00a35.6bn) a distant second. The merger with Seagram will produce a new company called Vivendi Universal, combining Universal Music, Universal Studios, the Canal Plus TV channel and Vivendi's telecoms and internet interests. The deal is set to be passed at the companies' respective shareholder meetings in mid-December. Vivendi has been ordered to sell its 23% stake in Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB by EU merger regulators, and could sell its holding back to Mr Murdoch. Vivendi chairman Jean-Marie Messier is now unlikely to take a stake in Mr Murdoch's Sky Global Networks, which is formed by the satellite TV interests of News Corporation. Analysts were quick to point out that this does not harm Mr Messier's global ambitions, as he already has a number of strategic partnerships with big hitters such as Bertelsmann, USA Networks and Vodafone. Vizzavi, the internet joint venture with mobile phone operator Vodafone, has a potential customer base of 100m and is set to launch in the highly lucrative Japanese market. Marc Loneux, media analyst at Commerzbank: \"Vivendi has a lot on its plate and does not need to be a minority shareholder in Murdoch's company. If you want to be pro-active and have a say in News Corporation's decisions, it is very difficult to get around Murdoch.\"",

Broadcasters the BBC, ITN and CNN - and news agencies Reuters and APTN - will share information between themselves and agree to limit the risks they ask correspondents to take while filing stories from war zones. The unprecedented alliance follows concern about record numbers of reporters and back-up staff being killed while reporting from the front line. According to the International Press Institute, last year 86 journalists and media staff were killed or murdered in the course of their work, making it one of the worst years on record. Already this year 37 journalists have been killed while on duty, including five in Russia, three in Sierra Leone and seven in Colombia. Richard Sambrook, deputy director of BBC News, said: \"This agreement represents unprecedented co-operation between competitors in the broadcast news industry to protect all journalists, staff and freelance, working in dangerous conditions. \"Our aim is to limit risk and to take responsibility for anyone working on our behalf in war zones or hostile environments. Safety can never be a competitive issue,\" he added. The media organisations have agreed guidelines that put safety above the pursuit of ratings. Assignments to war zones or hostile environments \"must be voluntary\", the guidelines say, and they \"should only involve experienced newsgatherers and those under their direct supervision\". The media groups have agreed not to put staff and freelances under \"unwarranted risks in pursuit of a story\", stating that such pressure is \"unacceptable and must be strongly discouraged\". A databank of safety information is being shared between the companies, so that up-to-date information is available to all on dangerous areas. The guidelines, announced at the Newsworld conference in Barcelona, will also cover the \"fixers\", interpreters and drivers used by all journalists in war zones. Last May, Jeremy Bowen, the former BBC war correspondent, and a freelance Lebanese cameraman narrowly escaped death after their car was hit by an Israeli artillery shell. Their driver Abed Taboush was killed and Mr Bowen, who now presents Breakfast News, and the BBC are considering suing the Israeli army for compensation fom Mr Taboush's family. Just two days later in Sierra Leone, veteran war correspondent Kurt Schork, who worked for Reuters, and cameraman Miguel Gil Moreno of the APTN agency were killed.",

Has anyone else done this? asks Nagarjun You're right, Mohammad Azharuddin did do this: he made 110 for India against England in the first innings of his Test debut, at Calcutta in 1984-85 (uniquely, he went on to score centuries in each of his first three Tests), and scored 102 in his most recent Test innings, against South Africa at Bangalore last winter. The only other man to have achieved this exact feat was Greg Chappell, the upright Australian batsman. In his first Test, against England at Perth in 1970-71, Chappell made 108 after going in at No. 7 with Australia struggling at 107 for 5, chasing England's 397.

In a scathing attack on the present sales system timed to coincide with the release of a highly critical report from the European commission on the same subject, Jamjar argued that UK consumers pay as much as \u00a31bn over the odds for their new cars every year. The problem, it said, lies with the car industry's \"block exemption\" from normal EU competition rules which allows it to restrict sales to franchised dealers and control prices in an unfair way.

      "bodyText": "Internet music provider MP3.com has sold Universal Music warrants to purchase up to 3m shares, giving the world's largest record company a potential stake of nearly 5% in the San Diego company. The purchase price was not disclosed but sources said Universal paid $250,000. The move follows an order by a federal judge calling for MP3.com to pay $53.4m in damages to Universal to resolve a copyright infringement case. Universal is a unit of Canada's Seagram. In connection with that settlement, Universal agreed to license its entire music catalogue - which includes Jimi Hendrix, U2 and rapper Eminem - to MP3.com's web-based service, My.MP3.com. Under the warrant, MP3.com's chairman, Michael Robertson, said Universal had the right to buy up to 3m shares of MP3.com common stock at prices from $3.75 to $5 per share over terms of one to three years.",

      "body": "<p>Chinese leaders object to lectures about environmental pollution from high-consumption nations such as the US when a quarter of China's population still lives on less than $1 a day. </p> <p>Until recently, Beijing said that while the environment was important China must \"put development first\" and should be allowed more leeway in tackling pollution. Now, increasingly alarmed by visible signs of global warming, the Chinese say they place \"equal stress on development and conservation\". </p> <p>But when economic interests are at stake will development really be throttled back for the sake of the environment? So far, in the critical case of the car industry, the answer remains ambiguous. </p> <p>Environmental arguments have to contend with a pro-car culture among provincial elites which has grown stronger during the past 20 years of economic reform. New motorways are a symbol of that development even though they are seriously under-used - largely because tolls are too high or slower-moving transport is banned. </p> <p>Most Chinese towns, even in rural areas, have been rebuilt with wide highways. The bicycle, once the symbol of Chinese self-sufficiency, is being pushed to the side of the road. </p> <p>China's official environmental website highlights the contradiction. One headline calls for a \"new goal for automobile pollution control\"; the other says, \"China must encourage the purchase of automobiles.\" </p> <p>By 2005, China hopes to meet European emission levels seen in the late-1990s. By 2010, it hopes to catch up with international standards and that does not take into account rising vehicle numbers. </p> <p>Here the Chinese state planning commission's policy is unambiguous: \"The automobile industry is one of the five mainstays of China: the promotion of automobile purchase must be placed in first position.\" </p> <p>Beijing reassures itself by pointing out that there are only 15m vehicles in China, compared with 70m-plus in the US. But the comparison is incomplete without considering respective emission levels. </p> <p>More serious efforts are now being made to cut emission levels in the big cities which are most visibly affected by pollution - Beijing has banned a fleet of mini-taxis while Chengdu has just staged China's first car-free day. </p> <p>Permissible emission levels have been loweredand, less specifically, the government is to \"encourage\" production and use of clean-fuelled vehicles. </p> <p>The big question is whether these tougher rules will be effective outside the main cities. </p> <p>The Beijing media has highlighted a campaign on the capital's outskirts to prevent \"air-polluting vehicles\" entering the city. Most offenders, it explained, \"were coal-carrying trucks\" hailing from neighbouring provinces - and if the trucks avoid Beijing they will not be taken off the road. </p> <p>Economists want to increase private car ownership to stimulate consumption and boost the home-grown car industry. Domestic automobile output rose to 1.83m units last year from just 150,000 in 1978. But with annual production capacity at 2.4m units, there is a strong incentive to fill the gap. </p> <p>At present, nearly two-thirds of vehicles are used commercially, including buses and trucks, while the 5.34m \"private\" cars usually belong to government bodies or firms. </p> <p>But real private ownership is looming for China's expanding middle class. There is intense competition to make economy cars around the magic price of 100,000 yuan (\u00a38,400) each. One in five urban families say they could and would afford such a car, prompting foreign carmakers to enter the fray: a process that will be helped along by China's entry into the World Trade Organisation.</p>",

But when economic interests are at stake will development really be throttled back for the sake of the environment? So far, in the critical case of the car industry, the answer remains ambiguous. Environmental arguments have to contend with a pro-car culture among provincial elites which has grown stronger during the past 20 years of economic reform. New motorways are a symbol of that development even though they are seriously under-used - largely because tolls are too high or slower-moving transport is banned. Most Chinese towns, even in rural areas, have been rebuilt with wide highways. The bicycle, once the symbol of Chinese self-sufficiency, is being pushed to the side of the road. China's official environmental website highlights the contradiction. One headline calls for a \"new goal for automobile pollution control\"; the other says, \"China must encourage the purchase of automobiles.\" By 2005, China hopes to meet European emission levels seen in the late-1990s. By 2010, it hopes to catch up with international standards and that does not take into account rising vehicle numbers. Here the Chinese state planning commission's policy is unambiguous: \"The automobile industry is one of the five mainstays of China: the promotion of automobile purchase must be placed in first position.\" Beijing reassures itself by pointing out that there are only 15m vehicles in China, compared with 70m-plus in the US. But the comparison is incomplete without considering respective emission levels. More serious efforts are now being made to cut emission levels in the big cities which are most visibly affected by pollution - Beijing has banned a fleet of mini-taxis while Chengdu has just staged China's first car-free day. Permissible emission levels have been loweredand, less specifically, the government is to \"encourage\" production and use of clean-fuelled vehicles. The big question is whether these tougher rules will be effective outside the main cities. The Beijing media has highlighted a campaign on the capital's outskirts to prevent \"air-polluting vehicles\" entering the city. Most offenders, it explained, \"were coal-carrying trucks\" hailing from neighbouring provinces - and if the trucks avoid Beijing they will not be taken off the road. Economists want to increase private car ownership to stimulate consumption and boost the home-grown car industry. Domestic automobile output rose to 1.83m units last year from just 150,000 in 1978. But with annual production capacity at 2.4m units, there is a strong incentive to fill the gap. At present, nearly two-thirds of vehicles are used commercially, including buses and trucks, while the 5.34m \"private\" cars usually belong to government bodies or firms. But real private ownership is looming for China's expanding middle class. There is intense competition to make economy cars around the magic price of 100,000 yuan (\u00a38,400) each. One in five urban families say they could and would afford such a car, prompting foreign carmakers to enter the fray: a process that will be helped along by China's entry into the World Trade Organisation.",

The vote has left the majority Bosnyak community in the weakest position because, unlike the Serbs and Croats, they split their vote almost equally between the nationalist Party of Democratic Action (SDA) and the multi-ethnic Social Democratic party (SDP). The immediate reaction of international representatives in Bosnia has been to sound disappointed, and even retract some threats they had made if multi-ethnic parties were not chosen. Mr Petritsch can be expected to continue to impose laws which the entity or national parliaments fail to agree on, using the powers vested in him by the Dayton peace agreement.

      "bodyText": "An embarrassing series of leaks has forced a key government health advisory body to abandon a confidentiality policy which attempted to keep secret interim decisions on whether the NHS should pay for new drugs. The national institute for clinical excellence (Nice) said its failure to prevent leaks, coupled with pressure from patient groups to make its decision-making process more open, has persuaded it to make public its \"provisional\" guidance on new health technologies. Its current drug assessment procedures require interim decisions to be released for consultation to a relatively narrow group of interested parties such as patient lobby groups, health professionals and manufacturers. The final decision on whether a drug should be made available on the NHS is made only after this confidential four week consultation period. Nice introduced the confidentiality policy under pressure from the pharmaceutical industry, which was concerned that releasing interim decisions - which might change after consultation - could have a volatile effect on the value of pharmaceutical company shares. It argues the interim decisions are effectively \"price-sensitive\" information. Without a confidentiality clause, it could trigger confusion on overseas markets which might not properly understand the nature of Nice's advice. But Nice says the policy is unsustainable because it has proved impossible to prevent leaks related to high profile or controversial drugs such as taxanes, used to treat cancer, and beta interferon, used to treat multiple sclerosis. Patient groups have lobbied for the \"patronising\" confidentiality policy to be dropped because it prevents patients and carers from commenting on the provisional advice while it is still at an emergent stage. Nice chair Professor Sir Michael Rawlins said the confidentiality policy was unsustainable and not in the interests of either the institute or patients. \"There are large numbers of people involved in the consultation process and whilst Nice can guarantee the integrity of its own processes, we can't control what others might do, therefore confidential documents have regularly been leaked,\" he said. But the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said it would forcibly oppose Nice's decision to drop the clause. It warned that if Nice goes ahead, drug companies might be put off launching new products in the UK.",

      "bodyText": "Laughing at life is one of the best ways of guaranteeing it does not end prematurely, scientists said yesterday. Researchers found that people who often laugh out loud and see the funny side of difficult situations are far less likely to have a heart attack than humourless individuals. The study looked at the humour responses of 150 patients who had either suffered heart attacks or undergone treatment for blocked arteries. They were compared with the responses of an identical number of age-matched healthy people who had no history of heart problems. The results showed that the heart patients were 40% less likely than their healthy counterparts to laugh in a variety of common situations. Michael Miller, director of the centre for preventive cardiology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, who led the research, said: \"The old axiom that laughter is the best medicine appears to hold true when it comes to protecting your heart.\" The findings suggested that making oneself laugh when angry might offset the harmful effect of stress on arteries. The team's findings were presented yesterday at the American Heart Association's annual scientific meeting in New Orleans. Study participants were asked to answer multiple choice questions about how much, or how little, they would laugh in a variety of situations. An example of one question was: \"If you arrived at a party and found someone else wearing a piece of clothing identical to yours, would you (a) not find it particularly amusing, (b) be amused but not show it outwardly (c) smile, (d) laugh, (e) laugh heartily? Each of the 21 questions had five answers. A total score was reached by adding the number of positive answers to each question. The highest possible score was 105, and the lowest 21.

According to Inside.com, both actors were afforded the opportunity to edit the film as they saw fit and then the two contrasting versions were shown to a test-preview audience. The result? The Costner cut won by a mile. </p> <p>Initially hired as the simple star of the film (a Pulp Fiction-style yarn about crooks who rob a Vegas casino during an Elvis convention), Costner wound up as arguably the last word on the finished product. A source close to the film insists that there was no unpleasant rivalry between the two actors, but that the versions each man submitted proved to be significantly distinct. </p> <p>\"Kevin's was more pure action,\" says the source. \"Kurt's was more character-oriented.\" Having won over the popcorn brigade with his action edit, Costner will now see his cut released as the final print.

      "bodyText": "In what is being seen as an unprecedented example of star power, actors Kevin Costner and Kurt Russell were both given the chance of overseeing the \"final cut\" on their new movie, 3,000 Miles to Graceland. According to Inside.com, both actors were afforded the opportunity to edit the film as they saw fit and then the two contrasting versions were shown to a test-preview audience. The result? The Costner cut won by a mile. Initially hired as the simple star of the film (a Pulp Fiction-style yarn about crooks who rob a Vegas casino during an Elvis convention), Costner wound up as arguably the last word on the finished product. A source close to the film insists that there was no unpleasant rivalry between the two actors, but that the versions each man submitted proved to be significantly distinct. \"Kevin's was more pure action,\" says the source. \"Kurt's was more character-oriented.\" Having won over the popcorn brigade with his action edit, Costner will now see his cut released as the final print. The source reckons that the movie's humble director - first-time film-maker Denian Lichtenstein - has no problem with that. Not if he knows what's good for him, presumably. This is not the first time that Costner has gatecrashed the editing suite after shooting his role. Hollywood gossip has it that he was a meddlesome presence during the editing of Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves where, worried about being upstaged, he allegedly juggled the edit to minimise Alan Rickman's barnstorming performance as the Sheriff of Nottingham. Later, on Waterworld, he is rumoured to have ordered costly post-production to digitally \"enhance\" his thinning hair. With such a track record, one can only imagine the changes he may have made to 3,000 Miles to Graceland. Keep watch, perhaps, for a Kevin Costner spectacular, co-starring oodles of luxuriant hair and featuring a blink-and-you'll-miss-him cameo from Kurt Russell.",

The effectiveness of internet banner advertising has fallen during the last year as web users have become increasingly ambivalent to poorly targeted ads. These findings are published this week by Continental Research in its sixth annual internet report exploring internet usage in the UK. More than 2000 respondents interviewed claimed to read or glance at only 12% of all banner ads they were exposed to, compared with 25% last year. The research also showed that internet users may be learning to ignore banner ads altogether. In 1998, 59% of internet users said they had clicked onto a banner ad that provided a link to the advertiser's own website. That figure has dropped over the past two years to 40%. The research also suggests that growth in internet take-up and usage has peaked, with expansion in both home and work internet growth showing signs of slowing down. Only a 5% increase has been recorded since January this year in UK home access, a considerable slowdown in comparison to other years.

      "body": "<p>Graham Reeves, a 70-year-old veteran of the Korean war, died on March 1 this year, five weeks after what should have have been a routine operation to remove a diseased kidney. </p> <p>Surgeons at the Prince Philip hospital in Llanelli, west Wales, were found to have removed the pensioner's one healthy kidney after allegedly failing to comply with established procedures. </p> <p>In an official report yesterday, the Commission for Health Improvement said that Carmarthenshire NHS Trust, which runs the Llanelli hospital and the older West Wales general hospital in Carmarthen, had produced a comprehensive action plan in the aftermath of the tragedy. </p> <p>But the plan had not been fully implemented and there was still confusion in the minds of some staff about the handling of critical incidents. </p> <p>Separate investigations into the bungled operation have already been carried out by the Royal College of Surgeons and by the trust itself. Neither has been made public on the grounds that the inquest into Mr Reeves's death has yet to take place. Dyfed Powys police are continuing to investigate the incident. </p> <p>The commission's chief executive, Peter Homa, said it could not be specific about the failures that led to Mr Reeves's death. But its report recommended that meetings should be arranged across the trust \"as a matter of urgency\" to ensure that common standards and practices are established for patients undergoing surgery. </p> <p>It said the trust should review its method for marking x-rays to ensure a consistency of approach. It expressed concern that the action plan had not adopted the suggestion that an additional nurse should accompany patients to the operating theatre and provide a handover. </p> <p>The report, which praises the enthusiasm and commitment of the trust's front line staff, found the two hospitals were struggling to work as one organisation. There was no overall programme for the continuous improvement of patient care. </p> <p>The commission expressed particular concern at the trust's \"outdated\" way of managing nursing staff, its lack of a human resources director and its failure to share policies and procedures now in place in operating theatres at Prince Philip with its sister hospital in Carmarthen. </p> <p>Mr Homa said these broader issues needed tackling urgently. \"If the trust carries out all our recommendations, local people can again have confidence in the services it provides.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Graham Reeves, a 70-year-old veteran of the Korean war, died on March 1 this year, five weeks after what should have have been a routine operation to remove a diseased kidney. Surgeons at the Prince Philip hospital in Llanelli, west Wales, were found to have removed the pensioner's one healthy kidney after allegedly failing to comply with established procedures. In an official report yesterday, the Commission for Health Improvement said that Carmarthenshire NHS Trust, which runs the Llanelli hospital and the older West Wales general hospital in Carmarthen, had produced a comprehensive action plan in the aftermath of the tragedy. But the plan had not been fully implemented and there was still confusion in the minds of some staff about the handling of critical incidents. Separate investigations into the bungled operation have already been carried out by the Royal College of Surgeons and by the trust itself. Neither has been made public on the grounds that the inquest into Mr Reeves's death has yet to take place. Dyfed Powys police are continuing to investigate the incident. The commission's chief executive, Peter Homa, said it could not be specific about the failures that led to Mr Reeves's death. But its report recommended that meetings should be arranged across the trust \"as a matter of urgency\" to ensure that common standards and practices are established for patients undergoing surgery. It said the trust should review its method for marking x-rays to ensure a consistency of approach. It expressed concern that the action plan had not adopted the suggestion that an additional nurse should accompany patients to the operating theatre and provide a handover. The report, which praises the enthusiasm and commitment of the trust's front line staff, found the two hospitals were struggling to work as one organisation. There was no overall programme for the continuous improvement of patient care. The commission expressed particular concern at the trust's \"outdated\" way of managing nursing staff, its lack of a human resources director and its failure to share policies and procedures now in place in operating theatres at Prince Philip with its sister hospital in Carmarthen. Mr Homa said these broader issues needed tackling urgently. \"If the trust carries out all our recommendations, local people can again have confidence in the services it provides.\"",

      "body": "<p>It is tempting to write nothing about last night's meeting between Italy and England other than a description of the despicable racism of the Italian fans, a significant percentage of whom greeted every touch of the ball by Emile Heskey with a chorus of booing and monkey noises. </p> <p>Two weeks ago, in Rome's Olympic stadium, in a league match between Lazio and Bologna, 20,000 or so of the home fans gave similar treatment to the visitors' three black players. Pierre Nlend Wome of Cameroon and the Brazilians Lima and Luis Oliveira seemed to shrivel under the hail of abuse, and no wonder. Last night it was the turn of the supporters of Juventus and Torino. </p> <p>Heskey appeared to handle the provocation with admirable sang-froid, and it was a pity that he could not ram the Italians' jeers down their throats with a goal, although he came close. In terms of the football, a 1-0 victory for Italy was an accurate reflection of the play, although there was an irony in the fact that the winning goal came from a superb long shot by Gennaro Gattuso, whose primary function during the evening was to keep David Beckham quiet. </p> <p>This was the fourth time Beckham had faced Italy, following the three games in 1997 - two World Cup qualifiers and the match in Le Tournoi. But it was the first time that he had been confronted by Gattuso, the 25-year-old hard man of the AC Milan midfield. \"I'll bring all my meanness to the team,\" Gattuso had promised the Italian public on the eve of the fixture, his debut in a starting role. In Italy the former Glasgow Rangers man is known as \"the warrior\", and Giovanni Trapattoni had shrewdly raised his morale by letting him know that he had tried to buy him for Fiorentina a couple of years ago, only to be outbid by Milan. </p> <p>The player Gattuso most resembles is Romeo Benetti, the Juventus and Italy midfield destroyer of the 1970s. Like Benetti, Gattuso can also play a bit. More than a bit, in fact, as he showed by his careful and shrewd use of the possession he won in the early stages of the game. </p> <p>But Beckham was not to be easily subdued. A beautiful early chip to Nick Barmby was intercepted by Alessandro Nesta on the edge of the six-yard box, and an even better ball from his own half up the inside-right channel found Heskey, who took one touch, held off Nesta, and smashed a drive just over the bar. </p> <p>Probably mindful of the significance of his armband, England's new captain chose to restrict the bulk of his activities to the area around the centre circle. But when he accepted the ball from Dyer just after the half-hour he looked up, measured the range, carried the ball a stride or two and then let fly with a dipping drive from 30 yards which had Gianluigi Buffon hurrying to slap the ball down at his left-hand post. </p> <p>England's young team showed no signs of an inferiority complex when confronted by the team who were only a minute away from triumph in Euro 2000. There were occasional hesitations and misunderstandings, but there was also a willingness to put together neat moves based on short passes and good movement, although the small inaccuracies that plague English football at this level were sometimes costly, disrupting the flow of otherwise well conceived patterns. The work of Barmby and Kieron Dyer, at times linking with Gareth Barry on the left, would have given Sven-Goran Eriksson food for thought, and when Barmby sent Heskey charging down the left the Liverpool forward's surprisingly delicate low cross was only a foot away from enabling Ray Parlour to put England into the lead. </p> <p>But when Buffon collected the ball and sent Italy back on the attack, a momentary lack of concentration in the England midfield allowed Gattuso to beat David James from 30 yards with a shot of which Beckham would have been envious. Unsurprisingly, Peter Taylor's men had finally been betrayed by their lack of international maturity. They, and he, deserve further chances to discover their potential for growth. The prospect of waiting until July for the new head coach's arrival may not mean the end of the world after all. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

In terms of the football, a 1-0 victory for Italy was an accurate reflection of the play, although there was an irony in the fact that the winning goal came from a superb long shot by Gennaro Gattuso, whose primary function during the evening was to keep David Beckham quiet. This was the fourth time Beckham had faced Italy, following the three games in 1997 - two World Cup qualifiers and the match in Le Tournoi. But it was the first time that he had been confronted by Gattuso, the 25-year-old hard man of the AC Milan midfield. \"I'll bring all my meanness to the team,\" Gattuso had promised the Italian public on the eve of the fixture, his debut in a starting role. In Italy the former Glasgow Rangers man is known as \"the warrior\", and Giovanni Trapattoni had shrewdly raised his morale by letting him know that he had tried to buy him for Fiorentina a couple of years ago, only to be outbid by Milan. The player Gattuso most resembles is Romeo Benetti, the Juventus and Italy midfield destroyer of the 1970s. Like Benetti, Gattuso can also play a bit. More than a bit, in fact, as he showed by his careful and shrewd use of the possession he won in the early stages of the game. But Beckham was not to be easily subdued. A beautiful early chip to Nick Barmby was intercepted by Alessandro Nesta on the edge of the six-yard box, and an even better ball from his own half up the inside-right channel found Heskey, who took one touch, held off Nesta, and smashed a drive just over the bar. Probably mindful of the significance of his armband, England's new captain chose to restrict the bulk of his activities to the area around the centre circle. But when he accepted the ball from Dyer just after the half-hour he looked up, measured the range, carried the ball a stride or two and then let fly with a dipping drive from 30 yards which had Gianluigi Buffon hurrying to slap the ball down at his left-hand post. England's young team showed no signs of an inferiority complex when confronted by the team who were only a minute away from triumph in Euro 2000. There were occasional hesitations and misunderstandings, but there was also a willingness to put together neat moves based on short passes and good movement, although the small inaccuracies that plague English football at this level were sometimes costly, disrupting the flow of otherwise well conceived patterns. The work of Barmby and Kieron Dyer, at times linking with Gareth Barry on the left, would have given Sven-Goran Eriksson food for thought, and when Barmby sent Heskey charging down the left the Liverpool forward's surprisingly delicate low cross was only a foot away from enabling Ray Parlour to put England into the lead. But when Buffon collected the ball and sent Italy back on the attack, a momentary lack of concentration in the England midfield allowed Gattuso to beat David James from 30 yards with a shot of which Beckham would have been envious. Unsurprisingly, Peter Taylor's men had finally been betrayed by their lack of international maturity. They, and he, deserve further chances to discover their potential for growth. The prospect of waiting until July for the new head coach's arrival may not mean the end of the world after all. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

It had intended to float the business, which includes British Sky Broadcasting, by the end of this year. That date has since been put back as far as next June. Speaking in New York yesterday, Peter Chernin, the company's president, said: \"We still think the IPO is the best option and it will be done by the first half of next year.\" However, company executives privately admit they are looking at several options in the event of continued market weakness. One of the most attractive is a plan to offer shares in its satellite operations to Hughes investors in a complicated share swap. The details of such a reverse takeover are still sketchy, but are likely to involve strategic partners making a significant investment. Mr Murdoch has made no secret of his desire to fold DirecTV, a Hughes company and the largest satellite broadcaster in the US, into Sky Global Networks. His problem is that, without the money raised from an IPO, such a deal would be difficult to achieve.

      "body": "<p>Al Gore last night seized on a morale-boosting legal win in the Florida courts to make a bid for the political high ground in the stand-off over the result of the US presidential election.</p> <p>Mr Gore called for a one-on-one meeting with his opponent George W Bush \"not to negotiate but to improve the tone of our dialogue in America\" while hand recounts continue in any Florida counties which wish to hold them.</p> <p>\"We should both call on all of our supporters to respect the outcome of this election, whatever it may be. We should both call on all our supporters to prepare themselves to close ranks as Americans and unite the country behind the winner as soon as this process is completed,\" Mr Gore said.</p> <p>It was not immediately clear how Mr Bush would respond.</p> <p>Mr Gore's attempt to inject statesmanship into his challenge to the Florida election results followed new moves by the Florida secretary of state Katherine Harris, a Republican, to stop the recounts and lock all outstanding post-election law suits into one court action in Tallahassee. But the Florida supreme court threw out Ms Harris's petition within hours of receiving it, allowing the counts to continue.</p> <p>The decision kept open Mr Gore's chance of emerging on top in the post-election dispute.</p> <p>Eight days after 100m Americans cast the votes that have divided the nation, the judges were asked to rule between two apparently tie-breaking motions from the Bush and Gore campaigns.</p> <p>Warren Christopher, the emissary to Al Gore, countered with a proposal that the Florida supreme court should rule instead on whether recounting by hand is constitutional, set a deadline and fix standards for legitimate votes.</p> <p>All the evidence suggests that Mr Gore is picking up more votes with each recount, even though he is still 300 behind Mr Bush, according to totals released on Tuesday.</p> <p>The recounts might not be finished for several more days and there was no immediate indication of how long the state supreme court might take to arrive at a conclusion.</p> <p>Referring to the Republican request to the supreme court, Mr Christopher said yesterday: \"The effect of this proposal would be to delay again the date to resolve the wishes of the people of this state. All of us want to have a full, fair and accurate count of the votes in Florida.\"</p> <p>And Ms Harris declared in papers filed with the state supreme court: \"Without question, the court must make clear that the election of the president and vice-president is not a matter of local pleasure.\"</p> <p>As the legal battle grew more intense in Tallahassee, officials in two of Florida's largest and most heavily Democratic counties continued to defy Republican attempts to close down manual recount efforts that could ultimately hand the White House to Mr Gore.</p> <p>Broward county reversed an earlier decision not to hold a hand recount and began tallying the 560,000 votes cast there on November 7. Officials estimated the recount would be finished on Monday.</p> <p>Meanwhile Palm Beach county also got started on a manual recount of its 420,000 votes after a court told officials that they could include the unbroken \"dimpled chad\" ballot papers in their efforts.</p> <p>Both counties were intending to comply with Ms Harris's call for them to submit reasons to her by 2pm yesterday explaining why they needed to carry on with recounts. A judge in Tallahassee ruled on Tuesday that Ms Harris has discretion to accept the results of such recounts.</p> <p>But Florida's largest county, Miami-Dade, decided against a hand recount after a sample exercise showed just six more votes for Mr Gore.</p> <p>In Atlanta, Bush supporters also lodged an appeal against Monday's decision by a Miami-based federal judge not to intervene to stop hand counts.</p> <p>As the legal moves multiplied in Florida, a key deadline approached for any attempt by Mr Bush to reopen the results of voting in Iowa, a state which Mr Gore won by just over 4,000 votes last week.</p> <p>Mr Bush has until 5pm today to ask for a recount.

      "bodyText": "Al Gore last night seized on a morale-boosting legal win in the Florida courts to make a bid for the political high ground in the stand-off over the result of the US presidential election. Mr Gore called for a one-on-one meeting with his opponent George W Bush \"not to negotiate but to improve the tone of our dialogue in America\" while hand recounts continue in any Florida counties which wish to hold them. \"We should both call on all of our supporters to respect the outcome of this election, whatever it may be. We should both call on all our supporters to prepare themselves to close ranks as Americans and unite the country behind the winner as soon as this process is completed,\" Mr Gore said. It was not immediately clear how Mr Bush would respond. Mr Gore's attempt to inject statesmanship into his challenge to the Florida election results followed new moves by the Florida secretary of state Katherine Harris, a Republican, to stop the recounts and lock all outstanding post-election law suits into one court action in Tallahassee. But the Florida supreme court threw out Ms Harris's petition within hours of receiving it, allowing the counts to continue. The decision kept open Mr Gore's chance of emerging on top in the post-election dispute. Eight days after 100m Americans cast the votes that have divided the nation, the judges were asked to rule between two apparently tie-breaking motions from the Bush and Gore campaigns. Warren Christopher, the emissary to Al Gore, countered with a proposal that the Florida supreme court should rule instead on whether recounting by hand is constitutional, set a deadline and fix standards for legitimate votes. All the evidence suggests that Mr Gore is picking up more votes with each recount, even though he is still 300 behind Mr Bush, according to totals released on Tuesday. The recounts might not be finished for several more days and there was no immediate indication of how long the state supreme court might take to arrive at a conclusion. Referring to the Republican request to the supreme court, Mr Christopher said yesterday: \"The effect of this proposal would be to delay again the date to resolve the wishes of the people of this state. All of us want to have a full, fair and accurate count of the votes in Florida.\" And Ms Harris declared in papers filed with the state supreme court: \"Without question, the court must make clear that the election of the president and vice-president is not a matter of local pleasure.\" As the legal battle grew more intense in Tallahassee, officials in two of Florida's largest and most heavily Democratic counties continued to defy Republican attempts to close down manual recount efforts that could ultimately hand the White House to Mr Gore. Broward county reversed an earlier decision not to hold a hand recount and began tallying the 560,000 votes cast there on November 7. Officials estimated the recount would be finished on Monday. Meanwhile Palm Beach county also got started on a manual recount of its 420,000 votes after a court told officials that they could include the unbroken \"dimpled chad\" ballot papers in their efforts. Both counties were intending to comply with Ms Harris's call for them to submit reasons to her by 2pm yesterday explaining why they needed to carry on with recounts. A judge in Tallahassee ruled on Tuesday that Ms Harris has discretion to accept the results of such recounts. But Florida's largest county, Miami-Dade, decided against a hand recount after a sample exercise showed just six more votes for Mr Gore. In Atlanta, Bush supporters also lodged an appeal against Monday's decision by a Miami-based federal judge not to intervene to stop hand counts. As the legal moves multiplied in Florida, a key deadline approached for any attempt by Mr Bush to reopen the results of voting in Iowa, a state which Mr Gore won by just over 4,000 votes last week. Mr Bush has until 5pm today to ask for a recount. If he does not, the outcome of the election will rest on decisions in Florida. Officials in Florida announced yesterday that they had so far logged the receipt of 447 overseas postal votes sent in by members of the US armed forces. The deadline for the receipt of all overseas postal votes - of which the military votes are a part - is midnight tomorrow. The totals including these votes are to be announced on Saturday.

The recent acquisition of cable operator Eurobell from Deutsche Telekom has extended the company's reach in southern England, and it aims to have 500,000 subscribers by early next year. The company's ploys for attracting customers have included high-speed internet access, but speculation continues that a merger with NTL would be the best way to challenge Sky. Telewest's major shareholders include US computer goliath Microsoft and Liberty Media Group, which has a stake in Rupert Murdoch's Sky Global Networks company.",

This years's public service campaign winner was The Alliance campaign from America's Arnold Communications for its hard-hitting anti-tobacco ads.

Not for nothing is Florida known to its own residents as the Banana Republic. It is a state with a history of election fraud to compete with any of its Central American neighbours. In Miami, the dead have been known to vote early and often. Ballot boxes take strange journeys, disappearing and appearing like phantoms.</p> <p>In the words of Mark Lane, a Florida columnist: \"The English can't cook, Italians can't form governments, Germans can't do comedy and Floridians can't hold an untainted election. It's just a cultural thing.\"</p> <p>It seems to have been ever thus. Since the British got control of Florida in 1763 in exchange for Havana, it has been difficult territory to govern. The redcoats were forced out 20 years later, but the colonists who replaced them found it just as difficult to impose their will on the local native Americans until president Andrew Jackson finally spent $20m on ethnically cleansing the entire Seminole Indian population.</p> <p>In the civil war, Tallahassee was the only state capital in the Confederacy not to be captured by Union troops, who were still garrisoned there in the pivotal election of 1876.</p> <p>That election was an uncannily similar precursor to the present mess. Florida only had four electoral votes, but then as now they were the ones that counted in the extremely tight contest between the two contenders: Samuel Tilden, the Democrat and Rutherford Hayes, the Republican.</p> <p>There were 50,000 ballots cast in 1876, a hundredth of this year's total, and at the end of the count, the two candidates were only 100 votes apart, amid claims and counter-claims of rigging. Ballot boxes were stolen and the state appeared to take forever to count and recount the votes. Sound familiar?</p> <p>By New Year's Day the next year, with no clear winner and the nation growing restless amid predictions of a new civil war, Florida sent not one, but three counts to Congress by three rival electoral boards. Two declared Tilden the winner. The other opted for Hayes. In the end a congressional electoral commission was set up which awarded the election to Hayes - a result still disputed.</p> <p>To this day, electoral malpractice is assumed to be part of the scenery in Florida, but it usually only affects the polls for mayors and local school inspectors. The only remarkable aspect of the 1876 and 2000 elections is that Florida, in all its glorious eccentricity, has ended up picking the man for the top job in the land. Otherwise, the post-electoral squabbling over ballots is entirely familiar to the locals.</p> <p>The fact that the election may hinge on the absentee ballot is particularly ominous. In Volusia, one of the four disputed counties, election officials were found in 1996 to have filled in hundreds of absentee ballots for the sheriff's job. This year in Volusia, one electoral official left a bag full of ballots on the back seat of his car and several other ballot bags were found to be without official seals. In the end, the police had to stretch yellow crime-scene tape around the electoral board offices in an attempt to salvage the credibility of the count.</p> <p>In Florida the dead not only vote, they have been known to stand for office. In 1998, there were allegations that one Republican candidate had actually been dead for three years. (It is not quite clear why someone had decided to stand using his identity.)</p> <p>In Miami, the mayoral election three years ago was so fraudulent it even drew gasps from a state inured to vote-rigging. The number of absentee ballots from Cuban-American precincts of Dade county rocketed and many were later found to have been cast by dead Floridians whose sense of civic duty remarkably appeared to have endured long beyond the grave.</p> <p>Eventually, the result was overturned and 56 \"vote-brokers\" who had organised the scam, faced criminal charges. The result was eventually overturned and Mayor Xavier Suarez, known as \"Mayor Loco\" for his penchant for visiting constituents in the middle of the night in his bathrobe, had to give way to \"Crazy Joe\" Carollo, who earned his nickname whipping up Cuban exile sentiment in the Elian Gonzalez affair.</p> <p>Since the elections, Mayor Carollo has announced he is standing down due to the collapse of his marriage, but other cast members familiar from the Elian saga are still in action, not least the irrepressible lawyer, Kendall Coffey. His career appeared to be over eight years ago when he lost a big narcotics case as a federal attorney and consoled himself by visiting the Lipstik Adult Entertainment Centre, buying a $900 bottle of Dom Perignon and retiring to an upstairs room with a lap-dancer, who at some point in the evening, he bit so hard on the arm that she pressed assault charges.</p> <p>But Florida is a state of forgiveness. Coffey rebounded to lead the legal case brought by Elian's Miami relatives to keep the shipwrecked Cuban boy in the US.</p> <p>Now he has reappeared Zelig-like in the election imbroglio, but on the opposite side, representing the Democrats - much to the disgust of the Gonzalez family, who have declared him a traitor.</p> <p>The ubiquitous Coffey is just one example. Almost every character with a walk-on part in this tropical farce seems to bear a Floridian twist. Terry Lewis, the judge who gave the crucial recount deadline ruling on Tuesday, turns out to have been an aspiring novelist, whose legal potboiler Conflict of Interest, told the tale of a Florida lawyer juggling alcoholism with the law</p> <p>Katherine Harris, the Republican citrus heiress who has since replaced Judge Lewis at centre-stage, was forced to hand back $20,000 in a campaign finance scandal in 1994 and has been criticised for over-spending public money.</p> <p>It is as if this hot steamy state was never meant to withstand the cold stare of international scrutiny and its denizens are shrivelling up under our gaze. It would be a shame if its exotic political fauna were killed off in the process and its unique electoral swamps concreted over once and for all, to make Florida safe for democracy.</p>",

In the civil war, Tallahassee was the only state capital in the Confederacy not to be captured by Union troops, who were still garrisoned there in the pivotal election of 1876. That election was an uncannily similar precursor to the present mess. Florida only had four electoral votes, but then as now they were the ones that counted in the extremely tight contest between the two contenders: Samuel Tilden, the Democrat and Rutherford Hayes, the Republican. There were 50,000 ballots cast in 1876, a hundredth of this year's total, and at the end of the count, the two candidates were only 100 votes apart, amid claims and counter-claims of rigging. Ballot boxes were stolen and the state appeared to take forever to count and recount the votes. Sound familiar? By New Year's Day the next year, with no clear winner and the nation growing restless amid predictions of a new civil war, Florida sent not one, but three counts to Congress by three rival electoral boards. Two declared Tilden the winner. The other opted for Hayes. In the end a congressional electoral commission was set up which awarded the election to Hayes - a result still disputed. To this day, electoral malpractice is assumed to be part of the scenery in Florida, but it usually only affects the polls for mayors and local school inspectors. The only remarkable aspect of the 1876 and 2000 elections is that Florida, in all its glorious eccentricity, has ended up picking the man for the top job in the land. Otherwise, the post-electoral squabbling over ballots is entirely familiar to the locals. The fact that the election may hinge on the absentee ballot is particularly ominous. In Volusia, one of the four disputed counties, election officials were found in 1996 to have filled in hundreds of absentee ballots for the sheriff's job. This year in Volusia, one electoral official left a bag full of ballots on the back seat of his car and several other ballot bags were found to be without official seals. In the end, the police had to stretch yellow crime-scene tape around the electoral board offices in an attempt to salvage the credibility of the count. In Florida the dead not only vote, they have been known to stand for office. In 1998, there were allegations that one Republican candidate had actually been dead for three years. (It is not quite clear why someone had decided to stand using his identity.) In Miami, the mayoral election three years ago was so fraudulent it even drew gasps from a state inured to vote-rigging. The number of absentee ballots from Cuban-American precincts of Dade county rocketed and many were later found to have been cast by dead Floridians whose sense of civic duty remarkably appeared to have endured long beyond the grave. Eventually, the result was overturned and 56 \"vote-brokers\" who had organised the scam, faced criminal charges. The result was eventually overturned and Mayor Xavier Suarez, known as \"Mayor Loco\" for his penchant for visiting constituents in the middle of the night in his bathrobe, had to give way to \"Crazy Joe\" Carollo, who earned his nickname whipping up Cuban exile sentiment in the Elian Gonzalez affair. Since the elections, Mayor Carollo has announced he is standing down due to the collapse of his marriage, but other cast members familiar from the Elian saga are still in action, not least the irrepressible lawyer, Kendall Coffey. His career appeared to be over eight years ago when he lost a big narcotics case as a federal attorney and consoled himself by visiting the Lipstik Adult Entertainment Centre, buying a $900 bottle of Dom Perignon and retiring to an upstairs room with a lap-dancer, who at some point in the evening, he bit so hard on the arm that she pressed assault charges. But Florida is a state of forgiveness. Coffey rebounded to lead the legal case brought by Elian's Miami relatives to keep the shipwrecked Cuban boy in the US. Now he has reappeared Zelig-like in the election imbroglio, but on the opposite side, representing the Democrats - much to the disgust of the Gonzalez family, who have declared him a traitor. The ubiquitous Coffey is just one example. Almost every character with a walk-on part in this tropical farce seems to bear a Floridian twist. Terry Lewis, the judge who gave the crucial recount deadline ruling on Tuesday, turns out to have been an aspiring novelist, whose legal potboiler Conflict of Interest, told the tale of a Florida lawyer juggling alcoholism with the law Katherine Harris, the Republican citrus heiress who has since replaced Judge Lewis at centre-stage, was forced to hand back $20,000 in a campaign finance scandal in 1994 and has been criticised for over-spending public money. It is as if this hot steamy state was never meant to withstand the cold stare of international scrutiny and its denizens are shrivelling up under our gaze. It would be a shame if its exotic political fauna were killed off in the process and its unique electoral swamps concreted over once and for all, to make Florida safe for democracy.",

The search for the Hinduja billions is a journey across continents.

As oil-rich Iran prospered in the 1960s and 1970s, the Shah embarked on a massive spending spree. The Hindujas cultivated close links with him and were awarded a vast range of contracts - from overhauling the electricity industry to supplying, during one fashion craze, trilby hats. On certain deals, notably an iron ore contract with India, the Hindujas acted as the Shah's personal intermediary. </p> <p>When the father died in 1971, the four brothers inherited \u00a32m and diversified into investment banking, manufacturing and property. By the mid-1970s they virtually had a monopoly in brokering the sale of goods from Iran to India. Their wealth was dependent on the Shah and they cultivated a network of informants to monitor threats to his regime. Srichand, the eldest brother, was tipped off in early 1978 that the Shah would be overthrown. Many of their assets - land, property, companies and shares - were quickly liquidated. Srichand Hinduja says he consulted politicians, economists and, bizarrely, his astrologers. \"In this way I analyse every country where we have a large stake from the point of view of an outsider, as if I had no investment,\" he said. He also said that he sold family holdings in Beirut before it was a war zone and predicted the successor to Rajiv Gandhi as India's premier by consulting astrologers and advisers. </p> <p>By the time the Shah of Iran was overthrown and in exile, the Hindujas were safely installed in London. But they retained a base in Tehran - a house, an office and about \u00a31.5m on bank deposit. And they continued to operate in Iran under Ayatollah Khomeni. This was through two companies - Sangam (named after a top-selling romantic film drama) and Ashok Trading which represented Daimler-Benz, Lockheed and PanAm. The Hindujas may be devout Hindus but they have prospered primarily in the Muslim world. </p> <p>The brothers were wealthy because of their deals during the Shah's regime. But their elevation to the super-rich was based on oil trading. In 1984 the Hindujas, in partnership with former Saudi oil ministers Sheik Yamani and Dr Taher, bought a large slice of the Gulf Oil company (mainly the Asian operations). But their relationship with the Saudi investors soured. The brothers bought them out and created the Gotco supply and trading operation which later controlled the Gulf brand throughout the world except Iberia and North America. Its holding company is Gotco Trading Ltd, registered in Bermuda. </p> <p>So the dictatorial regimes in Saudi Arabia and in Iran under the Shah have been ultimately, the background to the way in which the Hindujas have amassed their billions. <br> <a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Controversial plans to create an independent European defence capability under the auspices of the European Union will take another step forward at a \"troop-pledging\" conference in Brussels next Monday.</p> <p>Britain and Germany are each expected to contribute about 15% of the proposed 60,000-strong force, with France making a slightly larger commitment.</p> <p>The idea is that the EU rapid reaction force would be able to deploy for up to a year at 60 days' notice. Its role would be confined to peacekeeping, crisis management and humanitarian operations.</p> <p>A standing army is not envisaged. Each contributing country among the EU's 15 members will earmark elements of its armed forces for the so-called \"Eurocorps\", to be called upon when the occasion demands. Nor will any country be obliged to contribute soldiers to a mission whose objectives it does not support.</p> <p>The creation of the force, with permanent headquarters in Brussels, is supposed to underpin the development of a common European foreign and security policy under the political direction of Javier Solana, a former secretary-general of Nato.</p> <p>But decisive impetus for its creation was provided by last year's Kosovo crisis when European countries were severely embarrassed by their inability to match the US military commitment there.</p> <p>Longstanding US complaints that Europe is not pulling its weight when it comes to defence (most EU national defence budgets have been falling in recent years) became even more strident after Kosovo.</p> <p>On top of that, US policymakers (both Democrat and Republican) are increasingly opposed to US ground troop commitments in Europe, preferring to concentrate on areas of greater national strategic importance such as the near east and east Asia.</p> <p>George W Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, has suggested that if elected he may seek to pull American troops out of Kosovo and Bosnia.</p> <p>All the same, one of the reasons why the Eurocorps is controversial is America's fear that the force may become a competitor to Nato, the transatlantic alliance that has linked Europe and the US since the beginning of the cold war.</p> <p>The Americans have insisted that the European force must only be used in places or situations in which the US-led Nato does not want to get involved.</p> <p>There is also concern about duplication of effort between the EU force and Nato, in terms of planning, intelligence and procurement.</p> <p>Much time has been devoted to establishing secure links between the two organisations, in part to assuage Washington's concerns that Nato \"assets\" might be compromised.</p> <p>Other problems relate to the position of non-EU countries that belong to Nato, such as Turkey, Iceland and Norway, which fear their security may be impaired as the majority of their Nato allies concentrate on their new commitment to the EU force.</p> <p>Turkey and Iceland have said they do not want the EU to be given access to Nato military planning - a crucial link if the two organisations are to coexist without rivalry.</p> <p>Worries about \"decoupling\" are shared by European countries, particularly Britain, with it long history of close military cooperation with the US.</p> <p>Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, and George Robertson, the current Nato secretary-general (and Mr Hoon's predecessor) have been at pains in recent days to offer public assurances that the problems can be worked out.</p> <p>Lord Robertson has denied reports published last week that he recently told the prime minister, Tony Blair, in private that the EU's defence plans could trigger a transatlantic crisis.</p> <p>Those reports focused on claims that France, historically antagonistic to Nato as the supposed European arm of Anglo-Saxon global hegemony, was taking over the EU project.

      "bodyText": "Controversial plans to create an independent European defence capability under the auspices of the European Union will take another step forward at a \"troop-pledging\" conference in Brussels next Monday. Britain and Germany are each expected to contribute about 15% of the proposed 60,000-strong force, with France making a slightly larger commitment. The idea is that the EU rapid reaction force would be able to deploy for up to a year at 60 days' notice. Its role would be confined to peacekeeping, crisis management and humanitarian operations. A standing army is not envisaged. Each contributing country among the EU's 15 members will earmark elements of its armed forces for the so-called \"Eurocorps\", to be called upon when the occasion demands. Nor will any country be obliged to contribute soldiers to a mission whose objectives it does not support. The creation of the force, with permanent headquarters in Brussels, is supposed to underpin the development of a common European foreign and security policy under the political direction of Javier Solana, a former secretary-general of Nato. But decisive impetus for its creation was provided by last year's Kosovo crisis when European countries were severely embarrassed by their inability to match the US military commitment there. Longstanding US complaints that Europe is not pulling its weight when it comes to defence (most EU national defence budgets have been falling in recent years) became even more strident after Kosovo. On top of that, US policymakers (both Democrat and Republican) are increasingly opposed to US ground troop commitments in Europe, preferring to concentrate on areas of greater national strategic importance such as the near east and east Asia. George W Bush, the Republican presidential candidate, has suggested that if elected he may seek to pull American troops out of Kosovo and Bosnia. All the same, one of the reasons why the Eurocorps is controversial is America's fear that the force may become a competitor to Nato, the transatlantic alliance that has linked Europe and the US since the beginning of the cold war. The Americans have insisted that the European force must only be used in places or situations in which the US-led Nato does not want to get involved. There is also concern about duplication of effort between the EU force and Nato, in terms of planning, intelligence and procurement. Much time has been devoted to establishing secure links between the two organisations, in part to assuage Washington's concerns that Nato \"assets\" might be compromised. Other problems relate to the position of non-EU countries that belong to Nato, such as Turkey, Iceland and Norway, which fear their security may be impaired as the majority of their Nato allies concentrate on their new commitment to the EU force. Turkey and Iceland have said they do not want the EU to be given access to Nato military planning - a crucial link if the two organisations are to coexist without rivalry. Worries about \"decoupling\" are shared by European countries, particularly Britain, with it long history of close military cooperation with the US. Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, and George Robertson, the current Nato secretary-general (and Mr Hoon's predecessor) have been at pains in recent days to offer public assurances that the problems can be worked out. Lord Robertson has denied reports published last week that he recently told the prime minister, Tony Blair, in private that the EU's defence plans could trigger a transatlantic crisis. Those reports focused on claims that France, historically antagonistic to Nato as the supposed European arm of Anglo-Saxon global hegemony, was taking over the EU project. Lord Robertson was said to have told Mr Blair that Britain and Germany must do more to counter French influence. Despite its role being delineated in broadbrush terms, it remains unclear how such a European force may be used in future. Would it have sufficient air and sea capability, for example, to back up a Kosovo-like operation? Would it be called upon to help Britain in an intervention like that currently under way in Sierra Leone, where neither Nato nor the US itself has offered to get involved? Even if asked, would a country such as France say yes? Despite its long colonial era involvement in west Africa, it has not done anything directly to assist Britain or the UN peacekeeping mission in Freetown. But an even more intriguing question still hangs in the air as the Brussels meeting and the subsequent EU summit in Nice (which will give the force official blessing) approach. If the European force does become established, and is augmented as the EU enlarges to the east and south; and if in time countries such as Turkey join the EU (as it hopes to do), then who needs Nato any more?

(The Express had been busy reassuring its readers almost until the first sirens sounded.) But Anne Chisholm and Michael Davie, in their 1992 life of Beaverbrook, think it had more to do with the belated discovery that one of his favourite mistresses had also slept with Mountbatten. Even more bizarre was the way Beaverbrook's mouthpiece used regularly to assault the composer Sibelius, who had published nothing new since 1926. \"Call yourself a composer?\" the Express used to chide well into the 50s.

The boxer recently revealed that he served 32 months in a young offender institution and claimed boxing helped him to improve his life and receive a good education. </p> <p>The deal would represent a major victory for the corporation in its attempt to secure new sports rights and could be worth up to \u00a310m to Harrison depending on how successful he is in the ring. </p> <p>The BBC has a large amount of money set aside for sport after missing out on the right to televise highlights of Premier League matches with a bid of \u00a3123m earlier this year. It is believed that some of this money could be used to secure Harrison's signature. </p> <p>The deal would give the BBC exclusive rights to televise Harrison's bouts during prime time once the amateur boxer turns professional next year. </p> <p>A BBC source said: \"Greg Dyke [the director general] was extremely impressed by Audley and the public and media reaction to his win. </p> <p>\"Audley won gold on BBC television so it would be stupid of us not to get involved with him. At the moment we are asking a lot of questions, there are offers on the table but we have to see what's in it for us.\" </p> <p>Mr Dyke, Peter Salmon, director of BBC sport, and a number of other officials from the corporation's sports department are to meet Harrison and his advisers who have been examining ways to increase his profile and popularity with the British public since his Olympic win. </p> <p>Harrison is keen to use terrestrial television to promote his professional career in and out of the ring, believing that it would give him wider exposure than signing up with satellite television, as most boxers have done. </p> <p>The BBC would also give Harrison media training and use him as a boxing pundit and presenter on a number of programmes. He would be considered ideal for children's programmes and a number of prime-time evening shows as well as sports programmes. </p> <p>Harrison has been involved in negotiations with a number of boxing promoters and television companies since winning gold. </p> <p>Mr Dyke, who began his career in journalism as a freelance boxing reporter, believes Harrison would benefit from signing with the corporation in the same way that Frank Bruno and former world champion Barry McGuigan did during the 1980s, when their fights were shown on terrestrial television. </p> <p>Boxing has had a low profile on the BBC since the mid-1980s when world championship fights drew television audiences of 15-18m. </p> <p>Harrison's bout in which he won a gold medal was shown on BBC television and proved to be one of the most popular moments of the Olympic Games.</p>",

The boxer recently revealed that he served 32 months in a young offender institution and claimed boxing helped him to improve his life and receive a good education. The deal would represent a major victory for the corporation in its attempt to secure new sports rights and could be worth up to \u00a310m to Harrison depending on how successful he is in the ring. The BBC has a large amount of money set aside for sport after missing out on the right to televise highlights of Premier League matches with a bid of \u00a3123m earlier this year. It is believed that some of this money could be used to secure Harrison's signature. The deal would give the BBC exclusive rights to televise Harrison's bouts during prime time once the amateur boxer turns professional next year. A BBC source said: \"Greg Dyke [the director general] was extremely impressed by Audley and the public and media reaction to his win. \"Audley won gold on BBC television so it would be stupid of us not to get involved with him. At the moment we are asking a lot of questions, there are offers on the table but we have to see what's in it for us.\" Mr Dyke, Peter Salmon, director of BBC sport, and a number of other officials from the corporation's sports department are to meet Harrison and his advisers who have been examining ways to increase his profile and popularity with the British public since his Olympic win. Harrison is keen to use terrestrial television to promote his professional career in and out of the ring, believing that it would give him wider exposure than signing up with satellite television, as most boxers have done. The BBC would also give Harrison media training and use him as a boxing pundit and presenter on a number of programmes. He would be considered ideal for children's programmes and a number of prime-time evening shows as well as sports programmes. Harrison has been involved in negotiations with a number of boxing promoters and television companies since winning gold. Mr Dyke, who began his career in journalism as a freelance boxing reporter, believes Harrison would benefit from signing with the corporation in the same way that Frank Bruno and former world champion Barry McGuigan did during the 1980s, when their fights were shown on terrestrial television. Boxing has had a low profile on the BBC since the mid-1980s when world championship fights drew television audiences of 15-18m. Harrison's bout in which he won a gold medal was shown on BBC television and proved to be one of the most popular moments of the Olympic Games.",

      "body": "<p>David Blunkett, Britain's minister for education and employment, has challenged British businesses to use their fluency in English to gain a competitive edge in global trade. But his exhortation, delivered to business chiefs in London last month, failed to raise awareness about the difficulties that native speakers can encounter in communicating with people who speak English as their second language. </p> <p> Mr Blunkett told his audience that by the end of this year 750m people would have English as a second language, and second-language speakers would outnumber first-language speakers for the first time in history. \"It makes good economic sense that we use English fluency as a platform to underpin our economic competitiveness and to promote our culture overseas,\" he said. Mr Blunkett was careful to add that British people should not use this advantage as a reason to stop learning foreign languages. </p> <p> This point was welcomed by Peter Blackburn, chairman and CEO of the British arm of Nestl\u00e9, the European multinational. Mr Blackburn, who is an honorary fellow of the Institute of Linguistics, added: \"Business is becoming increasingly international, and British managers need to develop their knowledge of other languages - and, importantly, their understanding of other languages.

      "bodyText": "David Blunkett, Britain's minister for education and employment, has challenged British businesses to use their fluency in English to gain a competitive edge in global trade. But his exhortation, delivered to business chiefs in London last month, failed to raise awareness about the difficulties that native speakers can encounter in communicating with people who speak English as their second language. Mr Blunkett told his audience that by the end of this year 750m people would have English as a second language, and second-language speakers would outnumber first-language speakers for the first time in history. \"It makes good economic sense that we use English fluency as a platform to underpin our economic competitiveness and to promote our culture overseas,\" he said. Mr Blunkett was careful to add that British people should not use this advantage as a reason to stop learning foreign languages. This point was welcomed by Peter Blackburn, chairman and CEO of the British arm of Nestl\u00e9, the European multinational. Mr Blackburn, who is an honorary fellow of the Institute of Linguistics, added: \"Business is becoming increasingly international, and British managers need to develop their knowledge of other languages - and, importantly, their understanding of other languages. In business the spoken word is more important than the written word.\" Yet Mr Blunkett's speech overlooked the increasing challenges that the spread of English raises for native speakers. Not only will they need to understand how to communicate with people with a lower proficiency in English, they must also adapt their language to suit users of emerging regional varieties of English.

In Ramallah's explosive confrontation, Israeli soldiers fired heavy machine guns, sending dozens of people diving behind cars for cover, and rocketed the offices of the Palestinian ministry of local government on the outskirts of town.

      "body": "<p>The heir to Italy's most powerful industrial dynasty, was found dead yesterday. The body of Edoardo Agnelli, 46, was lying at the base of a 200ft viaduct in northern Italy after what police said was an apparent suicide.</p> <p>It was the second time in three years that tragedy had struck the family that controls the Fiat manufacturing group: Edoardo's cousin, who was being groomed to lead the business, Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, died in late 1997 of a rare form of stomach cancer at the age of 32.</p> <p>Police saw Edoardo Agnelli's dark Fiat Croma parked at the side of motorway between Turin and Savona, near the village of Fossano. His body was lying at the foot of one of the viaduct's pillars among plastic bags, bottles and other refuse.</p> <p>His father, Gianni Agnelli, 79 - long the charismatic figure at Fiat's helm, and now its elder statesman as honorary chairman - visited the site to confirm that this was the body of his only son.</p> <p>At the family villa outside Turin, at Villar Perosa, relatives came and went by helicopter through the day, preparing for the funeral that will follow a post-mortem examination.</p> <p>Edoardo Agnelli, had shown little aptitude for the business world in which his family has played a leading role for more than a century. Rather, he went looking for spiritual illumination in India, having graduated in oriental religion and philosophy.</p> <p>But his exclusion from the family's businesses - the closest he came to a responsible management role was as a director of the Agnelli-owned Juventus football club in the 1980s - caused him considerable unhappiness, as he showed in interviews where he protested at being marginalised when younger relatives got preferment.</p> <p>\"It's a tragedy,\" an unnamed woman friend in Rome was reported as telling the Italian media yesterday. \"I was expecting him in the next few days. He certainly didn't seem depressed, but sometimes a moment of anguish can be enough.\"</p> <p>Edoardo Agnelli hit the headlines in October 1990, when he was arrested in the Kenyan beach resort of Malindi for possession of heroin. \"I feel exhausted,\" he said on leaving court after learning of his acquittal on the drug charges.</p> <p>\"It has been a tough battle, which I think I have faced fundamentally on my own.\" He found it hard to live up to the expectations of his father.</p> <p>Gianni Agnelli, a former playboy who married Princess Marella Caracciolo, had abandoned a life of jet set dissipation to reveal an unexpected gift for business. Unlike his reclusive son he was at ease in the limelight occupied by a family that resembled royalty in republican post-war Italy.</p> <p>Tension over the Fiat succession came to a head in 1986 when Edoardo - known by friends in New York as \"Crazy Eddy\" - announced his interest in taking charge of Italy's top industrial conglomerate.</p> <p>In a newspaper interview in Assisi he criticised his family for seeing \"my personal search as a voluntary abstention from the problems of the group, almost as though I were incapable of assuming responsibilities\".</p> <p>But there was no fulfilling role available for the family scion who was more at home in the company of Indian gurus or the denizens of psychedelic era New York than in a Turin boardroom.</p> <p>In 1998 he again vented his frustration at being bypassed in favour of younger relatives.\"Part of my family has been taken over by a baroque and decadent logic,\" he said in an interview with the leftwing daily Il Manifesto. \"Meaning no offence to anyone, we are approaching the gesture of Caligula, who made his horse a senator.\"</p> <p>For his 22-year-old cousin, John Elkann, it was an unflattering parallel: the young man had just been selected to fill the shoes of Giovanni Alberto.</p> <p>In recent years Edoardo Agnelli, who never married, lived quietly on an uncle's country estate near Capalbio, Tuscany, pursuing his religious and philosophical interests.</p> <p>Angelo Magrini, the chairman of a blood donors' association in Turin, yesterday paid tribute to his social sensibilities and his generous work for charity. \"He was a marvellous person who dedicated his life to others. He was always very attentive to those who suffered and ready to help people in need,\" Mr Magrini said.</p> <p>As the oldest child of Gianni Agnelli - he has a sister aged 43 - Edoardo should have assumed command of a workforce of 240,000 and a global business empire spanning car making, construction, fashion and media.</p> <p>His spiritual curiosity and rebellion against materialism took him in a quite different direction, to an obscure life and a lonely death that confirmed his role as the black sheep of Italy's first family.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The heir to Italy's most powerful industrial dynasty, was found dead yesterday. The body of Edoardo Agnelli, 46, was lying at the base of a 200ft viaduct in northern Italy after what police said was an apparent suicide. It was the second time in three years that tragedy had struck the family that controls the Fiat manufacturing group: Edoardo's cousin, who was being groomed to lead the business, Giovanni Alberto Agnelli, died in late 1997 of a rare form of stomach cancer at the age of 32. Police saw Edoardo Agnelli's dark Fiat Croma parked at the side of motorway between Turin and Savona, near the village of Fossano. His body was lying at the foot of one of the viaduct's pillars among plastic bags, bottles and other refuse. His father, Gianni Agnelli, 79 - long the charismatic figure at Fiat's helm, and now its elder statesman as honorary chairman - visited the site to confirm that this was the body of his only son. At the family villa outside Turin, at Villar Perosa, relatives came and went by helicopter through the day, preparing for the funeral that will follow a post-mortem examination. Edoardo Agnelli, had shown little aptitude for the business world in which his family has played a leading role for more than a century. Rather, he went looking for spiritual illumination in India, having graduated in oriental religion and philosophy. But his exclusion from the family's businesses - the closest he came to a responsible management role was as a director of the Agnelli-owned Juventus football club in the 1980s - caused him considerable unhappiness, as he showed in interviews where he protested at being marginalised when younger relatives got preferment. \"It's a tragedy,\" an unnamed woman friend in Rome was reported as telling the Italian media yesterday. \"I was expecting him in the next few days. He certainly didn't seem depressed, but sometimes a moment of anguish can be enough.\" Edoardo Agnelli hit the headlines in October 1990, when he was arrested in the Kenyan beach resort of Malindi for possession of heroin. \"I feel exhausted,\" he said on leaving court after learning of his acquittal on the drug charges. \"It has been a tough battle, which I think I have faced fundamentally on my own.\" He found it hard to live up to the expectations of his father. Gianni Agnelli, a former playboy who married Princess Marella Caracciolo, had abandoned a life of jet set dissipation to reveal an unexpected gift for business. Unlike his reclusive son he was at ease in the limelight occupied by a family that resembled royalty in republican post-war Italy. Tension over the Fiat succession came to a head in 1986 when Edoardo - known by friends in New York as \"Crazy Eddy\" - announced his interest in taking charge of Italy's top industrial conglomerate. In a newspaper interview in Assisi he criticised his family for seeing \"my personal search as a voluntary abstention from the problems of the group, almost as though I were incapable of assuming responsibilities\". But there was no fulfilling role available for the family scion who was more at home in the company of Indian gurus or the denizens of psychedelic era New York than in a Turin boardroom. In 1998 he again vented his frustration at being bypassed in favour of younger relatives.\"Part of my family has been taken over by a baroque and decadent logic,\" he said in an interview with the leftwing daily Il Manifesto. \"Meaning no offence to anyone, we are approaching the gesture of Caligula, who made his horse a senator.\" For his 22-year-old cousin, John Elkann, it was an unflattering parallel: the young man had just been selected to fill the shoes of Giovanni Alberto. In recent years Edoardo Agnelli, who never married, lived quietly on an uncle's country estate near Capalbio, Tuscany, pursuing his religious and philosophical interests. Angelo Magrini, the chairman of a blood donors' association in Turin, yesterday paid tribute to his social sensibilities and his generous work for charity. \"He was a marvellous person who dedicated his life to others. He was always very attentive to those who suffered and ready to help people in need,\" Mr Magrini said. As the oldest child of Gianni Agnelli - he has a sister aged 43 - Edoardo should have assumed command of a workforce of 240,000 and a global business empire spanning car making, construction, fashion and media. His spiritual curiosity and rebellion against materialism took him in a quite different direction, to an obscure life and a lonely death that confirmed his role as the black sheep of Italy's first family.",

Attending a question and answer session in the marginal seat of St Albans, Hertfordshire, Mr Blair told supporters, many of whom had switched their allegiance at the last election, that he understood their frustration at the slow pace of change in areas like the health service, and urged them to \"have faith\". The prime minister's admission came as his party sent out hundreds of thousands of letters to supporters thanking them for voting in the 1997 election to ensure that \"Britain's moving in the right direction\". The letters also list the government's claims of success on the economy, employment and increasing the numbers of nurses. Labour also launched a poster campaign, featuring the slogan \"If you voted for change in 1997, thank you\". Mr Blair was later shown thanking voters in a Channel 4 programme that amounted to a party political broadcast. In the three-minute programme, The Political Slot, Mr Blair was shown talking to five-year-olds at an infants school in Hove, East Sussex, before confessing to their teachers: \"I want to say something unusual for a politician.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair has given the go-ahead for Ken Livingstone to become chairman of Britain in Europe's new regional campaign in the capital as part of the process of bringing the renegade mayor of London back into the Labour fold. Mr Livingstone, who broke with Labour to run an independent campaign which got him elected mayor last May, will head the London launch of Britain in Europe's efforts to boost the EU cause at a meeting on Monday. Officials and MPs confirmed that Mr Blair had sanctioned the move. It comes as both the prime minister and his foreign secretary, Robin Cook, made speeches this week to explain the importance of British EU membership in an increasingly interdependent world, which Mr Cook harnessed to an attack on the Eurosceptic media in the run-up to next month's Nice summit. In Sheffield today he will take his case further by outlining the three principles on which Britain will conduct its negotiations in Nice, where Eurosceptics are already predicting a sell-out to Euro-federalism. Mr Cook will say the principles are: \u0095 That a strong Europe spells a strong Britain which enjoys greater bargaining power as a result \u0095 That Europe is a union of democratic nations \"which is not and will not become a superstate\" \u0095 That Britain \"achieves more by playing a leading role than by standing on the sidelines\". The charismatic Mr Livingstone used to be an anti-European, but swung full circle like many other leftwingers in the 1980s and now advocates British membership of the single currency as vital to the economic interests of London - Europe's financial centre with 1m jobs in finance related services. Since being expelled from Labour for running against Labour's official candidate, Frank Dobson, the Brent East MP has made no secret of his wish to heal the breach. He has considerable grassroots support, but at the weekend conference of the Greater London Labour party, a Blairite loyalist, Chris Robbins, easily beat Geoff Martin, a Livingstone ally, for the vacant post of chairman. Coincidentally or not, 24 hours later Mr Livingstone appeared on BBC1's current affairs programme, On the Record, and made a series of conciliatory remarks ranging across the policy spectrum, albeit with the exception of transport policy. On John Prescott's public private partnership plans for the tube and his own plans for congestion charges for cars, Mr Livingstone insisted he is right, while making light of alleged rows with the deputy prime minister. But on taxes for motorists, the need to prevent fuel protesters' lorries jamming up London's streets and the need to remain vigilant against dissident IRA bombers, he sounded on New Labour's message. He even argued that the dome minister, Lord Falconer, should not be forced to resign. \"He had this mess dumped in his lap when it was unsaveable.

      "body": "<p>The prospects are bleak of preventing a total breakdown of the climate talks in the Hague where 180 countries are trying to conclude three years of negotiations designed to save the world from the fast increasing threat of global warming. </p> <p>Politicians from around the world are flying in this weekend to put the final touches to what should be a legally binding treaty that would make Europe, the United States and the rest of the developed world cut greenhouse gas emissions in order to save the entire globe from the worst effects of climate change. </p> <p>So far the talks have been a shambles with officials still trying to sort out half a dozen issues of principle that remain unresolved despite hundreds of hours of negotiations. </p> <p>The Americans, who were always going to get the blame if the Hague talks collapsed, are central to the problem. US negotiators had already said they could not reach their targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions without exploiting a number of loopholes in the agreement, but last week's US elections have made matters far worse. </p> <p>The US Congress and Senate have to ratify any agreement. Both are dominated by Republicans who have no interest in doing so. </p> <p>The talks are about the same agreement which, in 1997 in Kyoto in Japan, was hailed as a breakthrough when targets were set for every developed country in the world for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. The 5.5% reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions for the developed world were seen as the beginning of the long road to the 60% needed to give the world a stable climate. </p> <p>Since then there has been deadlock on how to conclude this first step. The US and its allies Canada, Australia and Japan have back-pedalled desperately to avoid taking real domestic action. They are trying not to upset the profligate lifestyle of their consumers and face the sort of political backlash that high petrol prices have caused in Britain, Germany and France. </p> <p>The astonishing fact is that 24% of the world's carbon dioxide is produced in the US - a nation used to the cheapest petrol in the developed world and the one with the least energy efficient economy. </p> <p>All but a handful of people now accept that climate change is a real threat. But because they include the executives of oil giant Exxon, George W Bush, and many senior Republicans, the deal seems further away than it did three years ago. </p> <p>The propaganda machine paid for by the oil lobby has been unrelenting in the US, and Opec members have done their best to hold up the talks for the last three years, but the real battleground in the Hague in the next week is now between the governments of the EU and the US and its allies. </p> <p>The EU, led by Britain and Germany, has taken climate change seriously for the last 10 years. Helped partly by the closure of the coal mines in Britain and the shutdown of heavily polluting industries in the former East Germany, the two countries both have carbon dioxide reductions targets of 20% - a serious contribution to the EU total target of 8%. This allows less developed countries such as Spain, Greece and Ireland to grow and actually increase emissions on the 1990 baseline. </p> <p>There is some doubt whether the EU will reach its target of 8% by 2010 without additional measures but at least there are serious efforts under way. </p> <p>The US openly admits it cannot reach its 7% reduction target by 2010. The growth in the economy since 1990 is partly to blame, but the Clinton administration has always said that it never intended to make all the cuts at home. </p> <p>There were a number of ways of using the might of the dollar and the technical know-how of the US to make reductions outside its borders that could be counted against domestic emissions. To the greenies and some in the EU these are loopholes which would allow the US to carry on business as usual, and the world would be no better off. </p> <p>The stumbling blocks in the Hague that the talks have so far failed to overcome are about these loopholes. The EU refuses so far to budge on the demand that the US take at least half of all measures to reduce carbon dioxide at home. The US wishes to exploit them without limit to reach its entire target outside its borders if necessary. </p> <p>There are three main loopholes. The first and best understood is carbon trading. If a country - Russia and Ukraine are the best examples - exceeds its targets of limiting carbon emissions, it can sell the surplus to a third country like the US that cannot reach its target. In this way the target for both countries is reached. </p> <p>The collapse of industry in the former Soviet Union has meant emissions of carbon from Russia and Ukraine have gone down hugely since 1990. Both countries are supposed to peg extra emissions to zero on 1990 levels by 2010 but neither economy will recover sufficiently by then to have reached anything like the former level of emissions. </p> <p>The US wants to buy these non-existent \"saved\" emissions to put towards its own target. Critics say this so-called \"hot air\" purchase is cheating because there will be no extra reductions in emissions than would have happened anyway. </p> <p>The second and even more controversial loophole is \"sinks\". At its simplest, this is the US, or any other country, planting forests on its own land, or in other continents, and counting the carbon saved in the tree trunks against its own domestic emissions. This is superficially attractive but detractors say the carbon saved is difficult to measure and question what happens to the credits gained if the forest burns down.The third loophole is opened by a wealthy country paying for a project in a poor or less developed one with the aim of saving carbon. </p> <p>\"These loopholes that the US insists on fully exploiting will render the agreement meaningless,\" said John Lanchbery of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. \"The science of sinks is hardly developed so it is impossible to say whether the savings are real or imaginary.\" </p> <p>Three years of argument have failed to resolve any of these issues. There are others, but it is the issue of loopholes on which the talks are most likely to founder. If anything, positions have become more entrenched. </p> <p><strong> Top Dodges</strong><br></p> <p>If countries can show they have saved carbon emissions by taking measures other than reducing energy consumption they can <strong> claim credit</strong> under the Kyoto climate treaty. Here are some of the loopholes: </p> <p>\u2022 Spread iron filings or iron solution across the surface of Antarctic ocean and other seas to stimulate <strong> plankton growth</strong> . Calculate how much carbon is in the bodies of plankton when it dies and sinks to the bottom of the sea and claim credits </p> <p>\u2022 Feed cattle, pigs and sheep special diets to reduce <strong> flatulence</strong> and so claim credits for reducing the amount of methane in the atmosphere </p> <p>\u2022 Buy the carbon dioxide Russia and Ukraine have not emitted since 1990 as a result of the collapse of their economies. The \"<strong> hot air</strong> \" available for a few dollars a tonne means the US does not have to take domestic action to curb its ever increasing emissions but does nothing to help the climate </p> <p>\u2022 Buy up <strong> forests</strong> and claim credits for not cutting them down, or plant forests at home or in foreign countries, and claim for the carbon dioxide captured in the trees and turned into wood </p> <p>\u2022 Use <strong> modern farming</strong> techniques like direct drilling into the soil rather than ploughing which releases carbon into the atmosphere </p> <p>\u2022 Pump carbon dioxide into the <strong> ocean</strong> to be absorbed by the sea, or pump it in liquid form into oil wells </p> <p>\u2022 Build <strong> nuclear power</strong> stations in China and India and claim it as \"clean\" technology, thereby keeping the nuclear industry alive and using carbon credits to subsidise the costs </p> <p>\u2022 Some Americans have suggested firing <strong> mirrors into space</strong> to reflect back the sunlight and so claim credit for slowing down the heating up of the planet</p>",

      "bodyText": "The prospects are bleak of preventing a total breakdown of the climate talks in the Hague where 180 countries are trying to conclude three years of negotiations designed to save the world from the fast increasing threat of global warming. Politicians from around the world are flying in this weekend to put the final touches to what should be a legally binding treaty that would make Europe, the United States and the rest of the developed world cut greenhouse gas emissions in order to save the entire globe from the worst effects of climate change. So far the talks have been a shambles with officials still trying to sort out half a dozen issues of principle that remain unresolved despite hundreds of hours of negotiations. The Americans, who were always going to get the blame if the Hague talks collapsed, are central to the problem. US negotiators had already said they could not reach their targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions without exploiting a number of loopholes in the agreement, but last week's US elections have made matters far worse. The US Congress and Senate have to ratify any agreement. Both are dominated by Republicans who have no interest in doing so. The talks are about the same agreement which, in 1997 in Kyoto in Japan, was hailed as a breakthrough when targets were set for every developed country in the world for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. The 5.5% reductions in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions for the developed world were seen as the beginning of the long road to the 60% needed to give the world a stable climate. Since then there has been deadlock on how to conclude this first step. The US and its allies Canada, Australia and Japan have back-pedalled desperately to avoid taking real domestic action. They are trying not to upset the profligate lifestyle of their consumers and face the sort of political backlash that high petrol prices have caused in Britain, Germany and France. The astonishing fact is that 24% of the world's carbon dioxide is produced in the US - a nation used to the cheapest petrol in the developed world and the one with the least energy efficient economy. All but a handful of people now accept that climate change is a real threat. But because they include the executives of oil giant Exxon, George W Bush, and many senior Republicans, the deal seems further away than it did three years ago. The propaganda machine paid for by the oil lobby has been unrelenting in the US, and Opec members have done their best to hold up the talks for the last three years, but the real battleground in the Hague in the next week is now between the governments of the EU and the US and its allies. The EU, led by Britain and Germany, has taken climate change seriously for the last 10 years. Helped partly by the closure of the coal mines in Britain and the shutdown of heavily polluting industries in the former East Germany, the two countries both have carbon dioxide reductions targets of 20% - a serious contribution to the EU total target of 8%. This allows less developed countries such as Spain, Greece and Ireland to grow and actually increase emissions on the 1990 baseline. There is some doubt whether the EU will reach its target of 8% by 2010 without additional measures but at least there are serious efforts under way. The US openly admits it cannot reach its 7% reduction target by 2010. The growth in the economy since 1990 is partly to blame, but the Clinton administration has always said that it never intended to make all the cuts at home. There were a number of ways of using the might of the dollar and the technical know-how of the US to make reductions outside its borders that could be counted against domestic emissions. To the greenies and some in the EU these are loopholes which would allow the US to carry on business as usual, and the world would be no better off. The stumbling blocks in the Hague that the talks have so far failed to overcome are about these loopholes. The EU refuses so far to budge on the demand that the US take at least half of all measures to reduce carbon dioxide at home. The US wishes to exploit them without limit to reach its entire target outside its borders if necessary. There are three main loopholes. The first and best understood is carbon trading. If a country - Russia and Ukraine are the best examples - exceeds its targets of limiting carbon emissions, it can sell the surplus to a third country like the US that cannot reach its target. In this way the target for both countries is reached. The collapse of industry in the former Soviet Union has meant emissions of carbon from Russia and Ukraine have gone down hugely since 1990. Both countries are supposed to peg extra emissions to zero on 1990 levels by 2010 but neither economy will recover sufficiently by then to have reached anything like the former level of emissions. The US wants to buy these non-existent \"saved\" emissions to put towards its own target. Critics say this so-called \"hot air\" purchase is cheating because there will be no extra reductions in emissions than would have happened anyway. The second and even more controversial loophole is \"sinks\". At its simplest, this is the US, or any other country, planting forests on its own land, or in other continents, and counting the carbon saved in the tree trunks against its own domestic emissions. This is superficially attractive but detractors say the carbon saved is difficult to measure and question what happens to the credits gained if the forest burns down.The third loophole is opened by a wealthy country paying for a project in a poor or less developed one with the aim of saving carbon. \"These loopholes that the US insists on fully exploiting will render the agreement meaningless,\" said John Lanchbery of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. \"The science of sinks is hardly developed so it is impossible to say whether the savings are real or imaginary.\" Three years of argument have failed to resolve any of these issues. There are others, but it is the issue of loopholes on which the talks are most likely to founder. If anything, positions have become more entrenched. Top Dodges If countries can show they have saved carbon emissions by taking measures other than reducing energy consumption they can claim credit under the Kyoto climate treaty. Here are some of the loopholes: \u2022 Spread iron filings or iron solution across the surface of Antarctic ocean and other seas to stimulate plankton growth . Calculate how much carbon is in the bodies of plankton when it dies and sinks to the bottom of the sea and claim credits \u2022 Feed cattle, pigs and sheep special diets to reduce flatulence and so claim credits for reducing the amount of methane in the atmosphere \u2022 Buy the carbon dioxide Russia and Ukraine have not emitted since 1990 as a result of the collapse of their economies. The \" hot air \" available for a few dollars a tonne means the US does not have to take domestic action to curb its ever increasing emissions but does nothing to help the climate \u2022 Buy up forests and claim credits for not cutting them down, or plant forests at home or in foreign countries, and claim for the carbon dioxide captured in the trees and turned into wood \u2022 Use modern farming techniques like direct drilling into the soil rather than ploughing which releases carbon into the atmosphere \u2022 Pump carbon dioxide into the ocean to be absorbed by the sea, or pump it in liquid form into oil wells \u2022 Build nuclear power stations in China and India and claim it as \"clean\" technology, thereby keeping the nuclear industry alive and using carbon credits to subsidise the costs \u2022 Some Americans have suggested firing mirrors into space to reflect back the sunlight and so claim credit for slowing down the heating up of the planet",

      "bodyText": "Boris Berezovsky, the controversial Russian magnate, launched a bitter attack on President Vladimir Putin yesterday, charging the Kremlin chief with ruinous policies and claiming that Mr Putin's election campaigns were funded by millions said to be embezzled. Refusing to return to Moscow to face questioning on his alleged involvement in a scam to embezzle almost $1bn (\u00a3700m) from the national carrier, Aeroflot, Mr Berezovsky said bluntly that Mr Putin was attacking him for political reasons. He contended that the president was the beneficiary of the money that the businessman is alleged to have embezzled. \"When Putin was a presidential candidate, he was absolutely unperturbed when profits from Swiss companies working with Aeroflot were used to finance the Unity party and the presidential election campaign,\" Mr Berezovsky said in an open letter published in the Russian press yesterday. He gave no evidence that the Aeroflot income was siphoned off to fund Kremlin politics. Mr Berezovsky controls the main state television channel, ORT, which last year played a decisive role in promoting Mr Putin and his fledgling party, destroying his rivals for the Russian presidency. The mogul's flight abroad means that the two most powerful figures in the Russian media are now in exile. Mr Berezovsky is believed to be in the south of France, while Vladimir Gusinsky, whose Media-Most empire includes Russian's biggest private television channel, NTV, is thought to be in London or Spain. Mr Gusinsky also failed to show up for questioning in Moscow on Monday in connection with a separate fraud investigation. Both men, bitter rivals united in their opposition to Mr Putin, insist they are victims of a political witch-hunt designed to eradicate Russia's most significant opposition to the Kremlin. Mr Putin recently said that he was brandishing \"a cudgel\" against the moguls, but had not yet used it. \"I'm forced to choose between being a political prisoner [at home] or a political emigre,\" Mr Berezovsky declared. Mr Gusinsky, who has had his offices raided, has briefly been jailed and now faces a Russian arrest warrant, also insists he is being hounded for not toeing the Kremlin line on sensitive issues such as the war in Chechnya and the sinking of the Kursk submarine. On Tuesday, Gazprom, the huge gas monopoly which is run by Mr Putin's allies, abruptly cancelled an agreement to swap shares for debt with Mr Gusinsky's Media-Most company. The Gusinsky team blamed the Gazprom u-turn on Kremlin pressure. On Monday, the general prosecutor's office issued an arrest warrant for Mr Gusinsky after he failed to appear for questioning. The battle for control of Russia's most influential media has been raging since the spring, when Mr Putin was elected. The Aeroflot investigation has been running for years in Russia and Switzerland, but it appears to be revived at opportune moments for the Kremlin. The allegations are that Mr Berezovsky, through cronies on the board of Aeroflot and through two Swiss-based companies, Forus and Andava, which he indirectly controls, siphoned off $970m (\u00a3680m) from the airline's revenue and ticket sales in the mid-90s. Yesterday was the first time, however, that Mr Berezovsky has alleged that the money was deployed to bankroll Mr Putin's rapid rise. But Boris Gryzlov, Unity's parliamentary leader and a Putin loyalist, dismissed the Berezovsky claims. \"Since he's now useless to the new authorities, he's resorting to any method to remain at the centre of attention,\" Mr Gryzlov said. \"When Berezovsky runs out of facts, he invents them.\" Both moguls are attempting to turn legal and criminal cases into political rows, he said.

The court was told that this was likely to be Harrison chanting \"Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna\", in a vain attempt to distract Abram. The attacker later said that if Harrison had talked to him normally he probably would not have attacked him. Abram told police that he had not broken any law because it said in the Bible that it was right to kill sorcerers and witches. After the attack, Mrs Abram said, she had a call from a psychiatrist who had examined her son. He told her that Michael was very ill. She said: \"This psychiatrist had only seen him for two half-hour sessions and it seemed he had diagnosed him that quickly. I was astonished: he was telling me he suspected that Michael was a paranoid schizophrenic and would need treatment.\" Abram is now being treated at the Scott Clinic, a psychiatric unit in Merseyside. His mother said: \"Now Michael is absolutely brilliant ... the son I had years ago.\" She said he had accepted he would be on medication for the rest of his life and feels huge remorse. Mrs Abram is calling for a full inquiry into why her son did not receive proper treatment before the attack. She said: \"I realise that services for mental health are badly underfunded. It is the Cinderella of the NHS. It is time that was changed.\" Letter of regret Michael Abram's solicitor last night revealed a letter of apology the defendant had written to the Harrison family. The letter, addressed to the crown prosecution service, read: \"I'm writing this in the hope that it will be passed on to Mr and Mrs Harrison. I wish to say how sorry I am for the alarm, distress and injury that I have caused when I was ill. \"I have seen many expert doctors prior to December 30, 1999, and yet I've never been told that I was suffering with schizophrenia or any mental illness. \"I thought my delusions were real and that everything that I was experiencing was some kind of witchcraft. \"I can see that all the things I believed then were not true and were just part of my illness. \"I know that Mr and Mrs Harrison fought for their lives on December 30, 1999, and that they must have been terrified by the lunatic in their house. \"I am very glad that I did not do any worse damage and I certainly do not blame them for any of the injuries I received myself. \"I am very sorry that this happened but I do not believe that it was all my fault as I was very ill at the time. \"I hope that Mr and Mrs Harrison can accept my sincere apologies. Yours sincerely, M. Abram.\"",

The EU is about nation states doing quite a lot of things together, and building a body of rules to make that possible. It's also, as Joschka Fischer said on Tuesday, about confining the EU within agreed limits, to which end a constitution would be helpful, a document that would inevitably describe a unique form of federalism. At the bottom of it is the need to make political sense of the aspirations and obligations in the treaty of Rome, in which Britain has been a major participant for nearly 30 years.</p> <p>To call this a quest for a superstate is mere propaganda. Endless repetition in the hyperbolic output of British anti-EU politicians has given the word bogus recognition, but that is what it is: bogus. Portrayal of the EU as a demonic conspiracy against the people, especially the British people, by a bureaucratic SS has become a substitute for thought and a suppressor of creative speculation about how the experiment might best move forward.</p> <p>Tony Blair, along with Robin Cook, is doing what he can to counter this. He did it with a significant speech in Warsaw, and again at Guild-hall on Monday. In the Commons yesterday he offered a few examples of how EU collective action has been in the interest of every European citizen, to which the paranoid hyperbolists across the House could offer no retort save a few juvenile jokes. But he does not really address the core of the antagonism, which derives from the inability of British governments from the start to explain with clarity that the EU is a political project, only capable of being accomplished by redefining what national sovereignty means.</p> <p>Mr Blair is the inheritor of a 30-year history. It is not a history of lies. Ted Heath and the other creators of British membership were always very clear that the EU was not just about free trade. But they were not so clear about what it was. They could not find the words or the courage to present \"Europe\" in its full splendour as an integrationist process. They didn't confront the British with the reality of what they were getting into. They told them entry was absolutely essential, but also that nothing they cared about would change. The truth is all there in the small print of their speeches and answers. But the campaign to change the hearts and minds of a proud and anti-continental country never happened. I cannot recall a single speech by a British minister, let alone a series of them, which explained in enthusiastic terms why both parliament and the courts needed, for the greater good, to lose some of their independent powers.</p> <p>This left a nation wide open to the sceptic rage that found its voice, and began to wield some power, under the Major government. John Major wanted to be European, but never escaped his entrapment in the pretence that Britain could be master of her fate come what may. After every successive summit, he said she had been. The dialogue of delusion was much enriched. There was no way Major could be straight with people. Fighting for survival, he had forgotten what straight, in this context, meant. Now the chickens coming home to roost darken the sky of a country that needs to be persuaded, from first principles, of the benefits of what it did 30 years ago.</p> <p>That's what Mr Blair feels he has to do before the Nice conference. He is the only leader since Heath to address Europe with a measure of constructive enthusiasm, but even he finds himself on the defensive. He's still ensnared by the analysis of deception and betrayal. Though he makes a fierce case for the lunacy of detaching Britain from the centre of Europe, he still meets the phobic hallucination of the superstate with an extreme reluctance to concede that the EU has, or will have, any of the aspects of a state at all: a shared political identity or, for certain purposes, a shared government that diminishes the familiar sovereignty of the nation state.</p> <p>His message is mostly about economics: jobs, trade, markets, growth. It is indispensable. So is continuity of commitment to the single currency, provided exchange rates converge. Peter Mandelson made an important private speech last night, pointing out the considerable benefits euroland is beginning to show for its investment in the currency, and the opportunities for growth which are likely to make it a success. The advances in Germany, France and Italy, which tend to be buried by the British press, are another harbinger for the never-in brigade, which it is no more willing to consider than the retreat of Japanese investors from a country trading into its major market with an over-valued currency.</p> <p>So, contrary to the triumphalist certainties of the sceps, the British euro is not a dead letter. It remains at the centre of Mr Blair's second term strategy. But before he can hope to win a referendum, I think he needs to deal more candidly with an issue he doesn't talk about, yet which is the radioactive element at the core of anti-Europeanism: the pretence that this is not a political project. To be persuaded to accept the euro, the British people need a civics lesson that goes back beyond his chosen terrain. He thinks he has to begin the case for the euro by explaining why the EU itself is a good thing. I think what people need before that is to be reminded what the EU is: an integrationist enterprise, now at a stage where fundamental debate is beginning about what its final shape should be.</p> <p>The sceps don't want such a debate. Uninterested in what other member-countries think, they already know their answer. Mr Blair would like the debate, but knows that unless Britain enters the euro, her voice will be more and more brusquely disregarded. It's right that at Nice he'll be defending, alongside 14 rival leaders, the national interest. But the only way to rebut the destruction-of-Britain-as-we-know-it already being announced as Nice's inevitable outcome is calmly to remind people that the EU is and always was about the invention of a new politics, which we are eager to be part of. This may sound painfully elementary. But there are decades of dissembling to correct. The way to beat the lies of the Sun is to start telling the truth which, for 30 self-destructive years, has dared not speak its name. <br><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

An independent report commissioned by the NHS executive said the Oxford heart centre was \"on its knees and riven by internal conflict\". </p> <p>Ian Bogle, chairman of the British Medical Association, said the reports might leave the public \"seriously concerned about the ability of the health service to deliver quality patient care, to learn from mistakes and to act swiftly when problems and concerns have been identified.\" </p> <p>Abuse of patients could never be justified \"but staffing shortages, excessive working hours and poor facilities can turn other, genuine, errors into tragedy\". The NHS as a whole would continue to struggle until the effects of new investment were felt. </p> <p>The Oxford inquiry, by a panel of experts in cardiothoracic services, highlighted staff reports of a \"drinking club\" culture within the centre, based at the John Radcliffe hospital, and found failures of leadership, antagonism between surgeons, difficulties in retaining nursing staff, complacency and secrecy. </p> <p>The report, which made 34 recommendations, said a policy for treating whistleblowers seriously must be introduced.

      "bodyText": "Public faith in the NHS's ability to deliver good patient care and act swiftly to correct mistakes would be tested by damning reports exposing failings within two health trusts and a leading heart centre, doctors warned yesterday. Surgeons, nurses and management were severely criticised after official investigations highlighted the need for hospital authorities to take more heed of whistleblowers. The commission for health improvement, the government's new watchdog on standards, criticised North Lakeland NHS trust, where elderly mentally ill patients were tied to commodes, and Carmar- thenshire NHS trust, where a patient died after having the wrong kidney removed. An independent report commissioned by the NHS executive said the Oxford heart centre was \"on its knees and riven by internal conflict\". Ian Bogle, chairman of the British Medical Association, said the reports might leave the public \"seriously concerned about the ability of the health service to deliver quality patient care, to learn from mistakes and to act swiftly when problems and concerns have been identified.\" Abuse of patients could never be justified \"but staffing shortages, excessive working hours and poor facilities can turn other, genuine, errors into tragedy\". The NHS as a whole would continue to struggle until the effects of new investment were felt. The Oxford inquiry, by a panel of experts in cardiothoracic services, highlighted staff reports of a \"drinking club\" culture within the centre, based at the John Radcliffe hospital, and found failures of leadership, antagonism between surgeons, difficulties in retaining nursing staff, complacency and secrecy. The report, which made 34 recommendations, said a policy for treating whistleblowers seriously must be introduced. A senior nurse, Colette O'Keefe, who has been on sick leave for a year, alleged she and her children had been threatened after raising concerns about public care. The health minister, John Denham, said the report \"paints a picture of a dysfunctional team and, more than that, a failure to deal with problems when they were first raised\". David Highton, chief executive of Oxford Radcliffe hospitals trust, said it would be \"a catalyst for improvements\". Degrading practices at the Garlands hospital in Carlisle, administered by the North Lakeland NHS trust, might not have been repeated if whistleblowers among student nurses had been heeded in 1996, a CHI report concluded. Patients were sworn at, tied to commodes, and denied food, clothing and blankets. The trust's chairwoman, Mary Styth, the chief executive, Alan Place, and the director of personnel, Catherine McCreadi, have been dismissed, and other senior management have received warnings. Peter Homa, chief executive of the CHI, said: \"The abuse of elderly people was appalling ... The culture of this organisation needs to change so that the rights of patients are understood across the trust.\" Nigel Woodcook, acting chief executive for the trust, apologised to patients and their families for the \"inexcusable mistreatment\" and praised the courage of students and health care assistants who drew attention to it. The CHI also criticised Carmarthenshire health trust for being slow to correct procedures following the death of a Korean war veteran, Graham Reeves, 70, of Burry Port, south Wales, who died at the Prince Philip hospital in Llanelli in February, after having his one healthy kidney removed by mistake. It said the Prince Philip and West Wales general hospital in Carmarthen were stuggling to work as one organisation following a merger of the two trusts that ran them. Failure to share procedures in operating theatres posed \"a significant risk\", and the management of nurses was outdated. Three members of the surgical team that carried out the operation remain suspended pending displinary proceedings.",

The programme involves older pupils or adults \"mentoring\" youngsters at risk of involvement in crime, parental education on the importance of listening to their children's anxieties, and a wide range of creative out-of-school activities.

      "body": "<p>When it comes to polluting the atmosphere, the US rules the world, mainly because the car is king. There are 1.3 people per car in the US compared to 125 people per car in China, and the scope of the problem from the consequent emissions is proportionately as great. </p> <p>While some individual states have made serious efforts to deal with the problem, there has, to environmentalists, been a lack of effective leadership on the issue at government level. Green groups argue that the state has done little to check the proliferation of \"gas-guzzlers\" and could have done much more to encourage domestic and commercial energy savings. </p> <p>\"Increasing the fuel efficiency of automobiles is the biggest single step that could be taken by the US government,\" said Dan Becker, Sierra Club spokesman on global warming. \"But this administration has done almost nothing to offend the automobile industry. We don't have time to spare. We have to act now.\" </p> <p>The Sierra Club and other environmentalists argue that there is a tool to achieve this goal in the form of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (Cafe) standards. Raising Cafe standards to 45 miles per gallon for cars and 34 mpg for trucks, vans, and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) is what they seek. For the past decade, the standard has been set at 27.5 mpg for cars and 20.7 mpg for light trucks. Particularly damaging to the environment are the SUVs - heavily marketed in the US and the most fashionable vehicles to own - which achieve just 13 mpg. </p> <p>Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors have successfully lobbied against changes in the Cafe standards; actions that the Sierra Club calls \"reprehensible. They are not only damaging the environment and increasing the risk of a dangerous global warming, but their gas-guzzlers are also worsening America's trade deficit and exporting more money from US consumers into the bank accounts of multinational oil corporations.\" </p> <p>Some states have taken their own action. In Arizona, a clean air act came into force in April but it has been catastrophic for the state government. Grants and tax relief were given to motorists who switched from petrol-fuelled cars to propane powered vehicles. The move was meant to cost up to $10m (\u00a36.9m) a year. Within six months the bill had reached $420m and could cost up to 10% of the annual state budget of $6bn. </p> <p>Less dramatically, California has decided that by the year 2003 some 10% of all cars offered for sale in the state must emit little or no pollution.

      "bodyText": "When it comes to polluting the atmosphere, the US rules the world, mainly because the car is king. There are 1.3 people per car in the US compared to 125 people per car in China, and the scope of the problem from the consequent emissions is proportionately as great. While some individual states have made serious efforts to deal with the problem, there has, to environmentalists, been a lack of effective leadership on the issue at government level. Green groups argue that the state has done little to check the proliferation of \"gas-guzzlers\" and could have done much more to encourage domestic and commercial energy savings. \"Increasing the fuel efficiency of automobiles is the biggest single step that could be taken by the US government,\" said Dan Becker, Sierra Club spokesman on global warming. \"But this administration has done almost nothing to offend the automobile industry. We don't have time to spare. We have to act now.\" The Sierra Club and other environmentalists argue that there is a tool to achieve this goal in the form of Corporate Average Fuel Economy (Cafe) standards. Raising Cafe standards to 45 miles per gallon for cars and 34 mpg for trucks, vans, and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) is what they seek. For the past decade, the standard has been set at 27.5 mpg for cars and 20.7 mpg for light trucks. Particularly damaging to the environment are the SUVs - heavily marketed in the US and the most fashionable vehicles to own - which achieve just 13 mpg. Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors have successfully lobbied against changes in the Cafe standards; actions that the Sierra Club calls \"reprehensible. They are not only damaging the environment and increasing the risk of a dangerous global warming, but their gas-guzzlers are also worsening America's trade deficit and exporting more money from US consumers into the bank accounts of multinational oil corporations.\" Some states have taken their own action. In Arizona, a clean air act came into force in April but it has been catastrophic for the state government. Grants and tax relief were given to motorists who switched from petrol-fuelled cars to propane powered vehicles. The move was meant to cost up to $10m (\u00a36.9m) a year. Within six months the bill had reached $420m and could cost up to 10% of the annual state budget of $6bn. Less dramatically, California has decided that by the year 2003 some 10% of all cars offered for sale in the state must emit little or no pollution. The states of New York, Maine, Massachusetts and Vermont have voted to follow suit. The California Air Resources Boards which regulates air pollution in the state - key bodies in the battle for cleaner air in the US - voted to impose the requirement last month. The move was denounced by the automobile industry. Currently an electric-powered car would cost $20,000 more than a petrol-fuelled car to buy. But green pressure is having some effect.

Together with a package of measures improving the regulatory framework in which credit unions operate, there is genuine hope for a further considerable expansion in both the number and members of this form of financial mutual. Other forms of mutual organisation also have considerable potential to aid and drive regeneration. Social enterprises use the talent and imagination of social entrepreneurs to generate mutual profit for the community they operate from. Coin Street Community Builders, on the south bank of the river Thames and owned by the local community, is one such example. It has built over 2,000 housing units exclusively for local people, with some of the best waterfront views in London. It has achieved this by investing revenues from temporary car parks to fund the redevelopment of the Oxo Tower, once a symbol of the decline of the London docks and now home to some of our brightest and most talented young designers. At the same time, the Co-op Commission is working up proposals to help modernise the oldest part of Britain's mutual sector - the co-operative retail societies. The potential of mutuals after a decade in the doldrums is beginning to be recognised. Gareth R Thomas MP",

      "bodyText": "The majority of homophobic abuse in Britain is supported by the words and actions of the Christian church, according to a report published today. The report, from the Commission of Christian Homophobia, accuses the church of institutional homophobia and claims that discrimination by the church against lesbian and gay Christians is widespread. The report will cause embarrassment to the church, which wants to be seen to be inclusive. The report claims that lesbian and gay church members are being expelled from congregations; lesbian and gay groups have been refused the use of church premises; and welfare and housing organisations run by the church have excluded gays and lesbians. The report recommends that church leaders attend homophobia awareness courses, among 75 suggestions for good practice. Richard Kirker, general secretary of the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement, said: \"If our churches are ever to become safe places for lesbian and gay people, they will have to act as is they know homophobia is evil and must be confronted whenever it surfaces.\" The report found that homophobia seriously affected the health of gays and lesbians, which could lead to absence from work, depression and suicide.

Everybody thinks appliances - simplified, dedicated systems - have great potential, but hardly anyone has managed to make any money out of them. </p> <p>The highlight of the show was undoubtedly \"the tablet\", a flat pen-operated personal computer unveiled by Bill Gates, Microsoft's chief software architect, during his show-opening keynote presentation. The tablet uses \"digital ink\", which lets users manipulate their handwritten text in exactly the same way as word-processed characters. The demonstration showed how text, written on the LCD screen, could be moved around and even turned into slanting \"italics\". </p> <p>The tablet PC is still a PC with memory and hard drive, running Whistler, the codename for the next version of Microsoft Windows 2000. </p> <p>However, it seemed to be the closest device so far to the Dynabook (Dynamic Book) computer proposed by Alan Kay, a Xerox Parc researcher, in the late 1970s. </p> <p>Most of the ideas developed at Parc, Xerox's Palo Alto Research Centre, have already become commonplace. These include graphical user interfaces (in the Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows and other systems), laser printers, and computer networks. Kay was confident that continuous annual increases in the power of microprocessors would eventually make the Dynabook feasible, and that day may now be in the foreseeable future. A large batch of prototype tablets has been produced for testing and Gates said systems could be on sale in about two years. </p> <p>The unfortunate part of the tablet demonstration was that it was not possible to get a good view of the operating system. Whistler is destined to replace both Windows 95/98/Me and new technology Windows NT/2000. It will also give Windows a new interface, which has not been seen before, though users will have the option to stay with the \"Windows classic\" look, if that is what they prefer. </p> <p>Whistler will run on any PC capable of running today's Windows 2000, but it is a safe bet that it will also trigger another \"upgrade cycle\". And users in the market for a new PC to run Whistler will be encouraged to opt for systems based on the new, more expensive Pentium 4 processors that Intel previewed at the show. </p> <p>In the past year, Intel has had its nose bloodied by the much smaller AMD, which has been selling faster, cheaper Athlon processors. Intel hopes the Pentium 4, along with price cuts on the Pentium 3 line, will shift the balance back in its favour. </p> <p>Although the PC market has also been getting a relatively bad press recently, IDC's Bruce Stephens said: \"the fact is, the growth rate is still pretty good\". The PC market grew by 19% this year, with about 140 million units sold, and Stephens expected 17% growth next year. </p> <p>According to IDC's research, said Stephens, the growth of the internet was \"benefiting the PC market, not appliances\". Only 28 million appliances had been sold in the past year, though he was predicting sales of 48 million units in the next year. </p> <p>Stephens said PC growth was particularly healthy in \"new markets\" (less developed countries), and that the growth rate for sales of portable PCs was above 30%. \"What's driving this is students, home offices and small business users responding to lower prices,\" he said. </p> <p>Jerry Purdy, president and chief executive of Mobile Insights, a Californian research company, agreed that the notebook PC was \"becoming the standard in two major markets: the enterprise and the college market\". Notebook PCs were replacing desktops as business professionals became more mobile. </p> <p>Purdy said this trend would be encouraged by the rapid acceptance of wireless networking. \"Wireless LANs [local area networks] have arrived and are going to become pervasive, thanks to the interoperability of the 802.11b standard.\" </p> <p>However, Purdy predicted that \"wide area wireless\" - based on cellular telephony - would \"continue to be a disappointment\" because of low connection speeds, while Wap (wireless application protocol) \"in its present form is never going to have wide adoption\". Purdy thought the mobile market would be a lot better when 3G (third generation) networks arrived. </p> <p>Some manufacturers have seen the appliance market and mobile computing as ways to avoid competition from PC industry giants. But the PC industry giants see these new areas as good places to expand their sales. </p> <p>Intel, for example, is targeting mobiles with its StrongArm processors, a design it acquired when Digital Equipment was taken over by Compaq, and which was ultimately derived from the British ARM (Acorn Risc Machine). </p> <p>Microsoft is also competing hard - with limited success - in the mobile markets with handheld PocketPC palmtops made by Compaq, Hewlett- Packard and Casio, and a mobile phone just launched in France by Sagem. During his keynote speech, Gates also showed a powerful prototype phone codenamed Stinger. </p> <p>The computing and telephony markets are obviously starting to overlap but this does not necessarily mean the computing companies will suffer. \"It's just as likely we'll see the death of the cellphone,\" says Jerry Purdy.

      "body": "<p><strong> Video phone</strong><br> Samsung is claiming a world first with its new streaming video mobile phone, below. </p> <p>The device, powered by a GEO Emblaze chip, has just been launched in Asia and is due to appear in Europe next year. It will allow users to tap into libraries of information and entertainment stored in the Mpeg4 format, as well as watch video mail. </p> <p>Most remarkably, GEO claims the technology can work over today's 2G networks - running as slow as 9.6kbps - as well as future 2.5G (GPRS) and 3G systems. (NM) </p> <p><strong> Ripping idea</strong><br> Samsung is claiming to have liberated MP3 from the clutches of the PC. </p> <p>Three of the Korean company's new hi-fi systems feature an MP3 encoder which directly rips tracks from CDs on to a 32MB SmartMedia card. These can be played back either via the hi-fi system or on a supplied Yepp MY-MP200 MP3 personal. </p> <p>Top of the range is the \u00a3500 NA-CP70, which houses a CD player, FM/AM radio tuner, amplifier and MP3 encoder in a PC-inspired tower configuration. </p> <p>In addition to a docking bay which is home for the 32MB Yepp personal player, the system features a parallel port that enables it to download music from a PC. </p> <p>The \u00a3400 S-P2450 integrates a similar line up of facilities in a more conventional mini system line-up. </p> <p>For music lovers who want to keep their options open, Samsung is offering the \u00a3350 MM-N7SM, a micro hi-fi that features both an MP3 encoder and a cassette deck. </p> <p>The three models, plus several MP3 playback-only hi-fi systems, go on sale later this month. </p> <p><strong> Do it digitally</strong><br> Sanyo is hoping to further blur the line between digital cameras and camcorders with a hybrid model now out in Japan. </p> <p>The IDC-1000Z iDshot uses a unique 5cm magneto-optical iD Photo technology developed by Sanyo, Hitachi and Olympus to store up to two hours of moving images complete with mono soundtrack on a single disk. </p> <p>With a resolution of 640x480 pixels the camera's video picture quality won't worry Hollywood too much, but it's more than good enough for use on the net. </p> <p>Alternatively, snap-happy photographers can archive up to 11,000 VGA-quality images on the disk. </p> <p>Sanyo also claims that the IDC-1000Z is the first digital camera on the market to feature an IEEE1394 interface for high-speed image transfer to a PC. </p> <p>Expect to see the model in the UK in the new year. </p> <p><strong> In-car MP3</strong><br> Panasonic has found an unusual home for its new high capacity SD (Secure Digital) storage media. From next month, Japanese buyers will be able to install a SD-equipped audio system, the SRX7000, in their cars. </p> <p>The system features a slot for the tiny SD card which can store music in both MP3 and the new, higher quality music compression format AAC. </p> <p> And just in case the SD card's capacity of 64MB does not deliver enough music for the owner's liking, the SRX7000 also comes with a CD player and radio tuner. </p> <p> In the UK, Panasonic is about to launch its first SD-compatible products. Very shortly stores in Britain will be able to display a trio of digital camcorders, the NV-MX300B, NV-MX7 and NV-MX5. These models offer videographers the option of using SD for storing still and moving images or music files. Prices for the models have not yet been made available. </p> <p>Panasonic is also poised to make its debut in the UK digital camera market with a model that is already on sale in Japan. </p> <p>Due in the UK some time next year is the 3.4 Megapixel PV-DC3000. </p> <p>The camera boasts a wide selection of facilities, including a 1.5 inch LCD display, 2 x optical and 3 x digital zooms, video capture, a playback speaker, built-in flash and manual controls for exposure and white balance and focus. </p> <p>It is compatible with both SD and MultiMedia cards.

Most remarkably, GEO claims the technology can work over today's 2G networks - running as slow as 9.6kbps - as well as future 2.5G (GPRS) and 3G systems. (NM) Ripping idea Samsung is claiming to have liberated MP3 from the clutches of the PC. Three of the Korean company's new hi-fi systems feature an MP3 encoder which directly rips tracks from CDs on to a 32MB SmartMedia card. These can be played back either via the hi-fi system or on a supplied Yepp MY-MP200 MP3 personal. Top of the range is the \u00a3500 NA-CP70, which houses a CD player, FM/AM radio tuner, amplifier and MP3 encoder in a PC-inspired tower configuration. In addition to a docking bay which is home for the 32MB Yepp personal player, the system features a parallel port that enables it to download music from a PC. The \u00a3400 S-P2450 integrates a similar line up of facilities in a more conventional mini system line-up. For music lovers who want to keep their options open, Samsung is offering the \u00a3350 MM-N7SM, a micro hi-fi that features both an MP3 encoder and a cassette deck. The three models, plus several MP3 playback-only hi-fi systems, go on sale later this month. Do it digitally Sanyo is hoping to further blur the line between digital cameras and camcorders with a hybrid model now out in Japan. The IDC-1000Z iDshot uses a unique 5cm magneto-optical iD Photo technology developed by Sanyo, Hitachi and Olympus to store up to two hours of moving images complete with mono soundtrack on a single disk. With a resolution of 640x480 pixels the camera's video picture quality won't worry Hollywood too much, but it's more than good enough for use on the net. Alternatively, snap-happy photographers can archive up to 11,000 VGA-quality images on the disk. Sanyo also claims that the IDC-1000Z is the first digital camera on the market to feature an IEEE1394 interface for high-speed image transfer to a PC. Expect to see the model in the UK in the new year. In-car MP3 Panasonic has found an unusual home for its new high capacity SD (Secure Digital) storage media. From next month, Japanese buyers will be able to install a SD-equipped audio system, the SRX7000, in their cars. The system features a slot for the tiny SD card which can store music in both MP3 and the new, higher quality music compression format AAC. And just in case the SD card's capacity of 64MB does not deliver enough music for the owner's liking, the SRX7000 also comes with a CD player and radio tuner. In the UK, Panasonic is about to launch its first SD-compatible products. Very shortly stores in Britain will be able to display a trio of digital camcorders, the NV-MX300B, NV-MX7 and NV-MX5. These models offer videographers the option of using SD for storing still and moving images or music files. Prices for the models have not yet been made available. Panasonic is also poised to make its debut in the UK digital camera market with a model that is already on sale in Japan. Due in the UK some time next year is the 3.4 Megapixel PV-DC3000. The camera boasts a wide selection of facilities, including a 1.5 inch LCD display, 2 x optical and 3 x digital zooms, video capture, a playback speaker, built-in flash and manual controls for exposure and white balance and focus. It is compatible with both SD and MultiMedia cards. (AN)",

The survey, by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, talked to 41 young women in Doncaster who had become pregnant at a young age and, in the vast majority of cases, continued with the pregnancy to full term. It found that almost all had been shocked to discover they were pregnant. They were not trying to please their boyfriends, and most took the decision on whether or not to keep their baby without much reference to the child's father.</p> <p>Most tellingly, they were far from irresponsible. In fact, the teenagers were so convinced of the need to take responsibility for their own actions that terminating the pregnancy was not an option considered.

It just wasn't something that people like them did.\"</p> <p>\"What is so interesting is this incredible difference when it comes to social groups and abortion,\" says Anne Weyman, chief executive of the Family Planning Association. \"Middle-class girls, we know, are less likely to get pregnant than less well-off girls, but they are also much more likely to have abortions.

Education on family planning and sexual health simply tries to sweep abortion under the carpet, argues Weyman. \"There has been a real reluctance to consider that abortion is an important option for young women, and to make sure that it is offered to them. Everything is about prevention - which is good - and support for new parents - also good - but there is nothing about the choice you can make in the middle of these two options.\"</p> <p>She points out that government guidelines on sex education have not, until this year, included a recommendation that girls be given advice on terminations.

I didn't use protection, it's not the baby's fault.'\"</p> <p>James is 19 and already the father of a one-year-old son. While he does regret his role in the pregnancy, he is convinced of the importance of taking responsibility for creating a life. \"It happened, and now I have a responsibility to my child. It is difficult trying to bring up a baby on my own, they are expensive and it limits the things I can do in my life. But it is not me that is important any more, my child is my priority.\"</p> <p>\"In this country we have a very censorious view about the unwanted consequences of sexual activity,\" says Weyman. \"It makes young people believe that, well, I've had sex, so I have to live with the outcome. It's a lack of being able to say, well I do have a choice.\"</p> <p>For teenagers who do decide to have an abortion, the decision is tough, argues 16-year-old Aisha. \"When I realised I was pregnant, I just cried and cried and cried. It's like, when you're young, you dream about having children and being with someone you love, and all that is taken from you in 10 minutes and a pregnancy test.\"</p> <p>Aisha lives in London and is at college taking A-levels. \"Having an abortion was the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with, and I don't think there can ever be anything worse. Some people are like, how can anyone kill their child? That's how I felt about myself, afterwards, but it wasn't like that. I'm 16, I couldn't support a little child financially, and I wasn't ready emotionally. How could I bring a life into this world when I knew it would suffer.\"</p> <p>Aisha explains that her background made the decision even more difficult for her. \"For any daughter to tell her parents she is 15 and pregnant is hard. But when your parents follow traditional Indian beliefs and are obsessed with keeping the family name respectful ... at least some people have their families support when they have abortions, I had nothing.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Ian Russell is bound to feel a trifle exposed when he addresses an Institute of Economic Affairs conference on energy policy next week. Scottish Power's deputy chief executive last week dared to speak out loud the private gripes of many of his colleagues in the gas and electricity industry: British Gas, the former state monopoly now part of Centrica, controls a huge slice of what is supposed to be an open, free and competitive market. </p> <p>Mr Russell, who takes over as chief executive from Sir Ian Robinson in April, suggested that Centrica's share of the retail market was 80% and the group was so dominant that the industry regulator Ofgem ought to step in. \"If we are really interested in having a strong, competitive market there have to be several strong competitors, but there are not many markets where one player has 80% and the regulator is supposed to be encouraging competition.\" </p> <p>He now regrets his comments, which are common currency among other Centrica rivals, but he has a point. Scottish Power, which also owns Manweb, the electricity company based in Manchester, has lost 200,000 customers in the past six months - almost entirely to British Gas - and now has 3.5m accounts. But Mr Russell thinks 6m to 7m is the optimum base on which to take on Centrica, and rivals can hardly match the \u00a3150m national advertising campaign British Gas is running to capture new electricity or \"dual fuel\" customers and win back those who have switched to other suppliers. </p> <p>There are 26m electricity customers and 20m gas customers in Britain and British Gas has 3.5m of the former and 14m of the latter, giving it 15% and 70% of those respective markets. \"No other company in British history has ever had so many customers - apart from BT,\" says Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at Williams de Broe. \"We have always argued that Centrica is so much in pole position that anybody competing has to face the fact they are very hard to dislodge ... It's like a horse race in which Centrica is way out in front by the first furlong.\" </p> <p>Mr Russell's problem is partly to do with his group's name, which plays well in the old South of Scotland Electricity Board region it inherited and, as Manweb, in parts of the north-west of England. But it scarcely works as a brand in other regions. Centrica can trade as British Gas in England, Scottish Gas in Scotland and Nwy Prydain in Wales. Scottish Power owns Southern Water which gives it a customer base of 5.5m but admitted last week only 8% of Southern's clients take its energy offering.

      "bodyText": "Ian Russell is bound to feel a trifle exposed when he addresses an Institute of Economic Affairs conference on energy policy next week. Scottish Power's deputy chief executive last week dared to speak out loud the private gripes of many of his colleagues in the gas and electricity industry: British Gas, the former state monopoly now part of Centrica, controls a huge slice of what is supposed to be an open, free and competitive market. Mr Russell, who takes over as chief executive from Sir Ian Robinson in April, suggested that Centrica's share of the retail market was 80% and the group was so dominant that the industry regulator Ofgem ought to step in. \"If we are really interested in having a strong, competitive market there have to be several strong competitors, but there are not many markets where one player has 80% and the regulator is supposed to be encouraging competition.\" He now regrets his comments, which are common currency among other Centrica rivals, but he has a point. Scottish Power, which also owns Manweb, the electricity company based in Manchester, has lost 200,000 customers in the past six months - almost entirely to British Gas - and now has 3.5m accounts. But Mr Russell thinks 6m to 7m is the optimum base on which to take on Centrica, and rivals can hardly match the \u00a3150m national advertising campaign British Gas is running to capture new electricity or \"dual fuel\" customers and win back those who have switched to other suppliers. There are 26m electricity customers and 20m gas customers in Britain and British Gas has 3.5m of the former and 14m of the latter, giving it 15% and 70% of those respective markets. \"No other company in British history has ever had so many customers - apart from BT,\" says Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at Williams de Broe. \"We have always argued that Centrica is so much in pole position that anybody competing has to face the fact they are very hard to dislodge ... It's like a horse race in which Centrica is way out in front by the first furlong.\" Mr Russell's problem is partly to do with his group's name, which plays well in the old South of Scotland Electricity Board region it inherited and, as Manweb, in parts of the north-west of England. But it scarcely works as a brand in other regions. Centrica can trade as British Gas in England, Scottish Gas in Scotland and Nwy Prydain in Wales. Scottish Power owns Southern Water which gives it a customer base of 5.5m but admitted last week only 8% of Southern's clients take its energy offering. Most of the 14 privatised regional electricity companies in England and Wales, now often in foreign hands, remain trapped in their original franchise area. Powergen, which bought East Midlands Electricity to move into the retail energy market, can happily trade, however, on its national brand image through sponsorship of the weather forecast on ITV. \"It's a three-horse race wherever you go,\" officials say. \"There's British Gas - the people to beat - and the regional incumbent.\" Powergen has 2.8m customers and is prepared to pay \u00a330-\u00a340 each to attract new ones on its way to reaching its target of 5m by the end of 2002 - compared to the cost of up to \u00a3250 per customer involved in acquisition.

I then played alongside him at many charity concerts around the Border country. During the last 20 years or so, along with fellow shepherds Joe Hutton and Will Atkinson, he brought the authentic sound of traditional music from Northumberland and the Borders to festival audiences from Cambridge to Sidmouth, from Whitby to Shetland, and to the Queen Elizabeth Hall, in London.</p> <p>Aly Bain, the internationally renowned Shetland fiddler, described Willie as the finest player of jigs he had ever heard. He injected a dynamic drive into every tune he played, achieving much of his attack by the use of very strong up-bows at points where most fiddlers would use a down-bow, producing some of the most rhythmic music around.</p> <p>Willie's playing has had a tremendous influence on musicians of my generation, and on Kathryn Tickell, Nancy Kerr and other younger performers. Many of the tunes he composed are now established favourites in the repertoire of musicians the length and breadth of the country. He recorded a solo album, Welcome To The Dene (1991) and with his fellow shepherds, the classic, Harthope Burn (1983). He is also featured on the Topic 20 CD set, Voice of the People (1998).</p> <p>He was born at Lilburn near Wooler, grew up in upper Coquetdale and lived all his life in north Northumberland. He learned to play fiddle as a youngster, but as a result of an accident while slicing turnips for the sheep, he lost the first finger of his left hand. He transferred his music-making to the melodeon and became a fine exponent on the box, but eventually returned to the fiddle and, with a single-minded tenacity that was characteristic of him, completely re-learned how to play, using his remaining fingers.</p> <p>As a young man, Willie worked alongside fellow hill shepherd Geordie Armstrong and lodged with him at High Bleakhope, an isolated cottage at the head of the Breamish valley. Geordie was also a fiddle player, and Willie always attributed his own style of playing to the hours they spent whiling away the long winter nights learning new tunes and going over old favourites until they achieved just the \"lift\" they wanted.</p> <p>Willie played mainly within his own community, walking miles over the hills to play at village dances, which would often continue through the night until it was light enough to walk back over the hills, arriving home just in time to start work the next day.</p> <p>All his working life was spent in the heart of the Cheviots, herding large flocks in wild hill country. He often had such a large area to cover that he used a pony to \"look\" the sheep, and it was while riding home after a hard day on the hills that he would work on the melody of his latest composition in his head, allowing the pony to find its own way home.</p> <p>The conversations in the car with Willie, Joe Hutton and Will Atkinson as we drove to engagements were always fascinating. We would start with a litany of every field we passed, discussing who had worked there, who they worked with, went to school with or were related to - keeping a mental map of their community and family links fresh in their minds. As we moved out of their home area, they would note any new agricultural practices - some of which would be welcomed whole-heartedly, others dismissed as short-term cost savings that would store up trouble for the future.</p> <p>A man of wide interests and a voracious reader of books of travel and exploration, Willie seemed to like to know how his corner of the Borders fitted into the jigsaw of the world. He would sit for hours reading an atlas and, although he travelled little himself, whenever he met someone who had been travelling abroad he would amaze them by his precise knowledge of the geography of some far distant land.</p> <p>A man of independent spirit, Willie took a deep interest in anything to which he turned his hand. His life was filled with the rhythms of the Borders: the yearly cycle of rearing sheep, the seasonal tasks of his highly productive garden and, of course, the rhythms and melodies of the music of the Borders. He will be greatly missed by lovers of traditional music throughout the country, but his music will live on.</p> <p>Willie is survived by his wife Nancy, son Neil, grand-daughters Kerry and Emma and great grand-daughters Lucy and Sumer.</p> <p>\u0095 William Cowans Taylor, shepherd and musician, born January 5 1916; died November 2 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "I first met the Cheviot shepherd, fiddle player and composer Willie Taylor, who has died aged 84, at the Alnwick music gathering in the late 1960s. I then played alongside him at many charity concerts around the Border country. During the last 20 years or so, along with fellow shepherds Joe Hutton and Will Atkinson, he brought the authentic sound of traditional music from Northumberland and the Borders to festival audiences from Cambridge to Sidmouth, from Whitby to Shetland, and to the Queen Elizabeth Hall, in London. Aly Bain, the internationally renowned Shetland fiddler, described Willie as the finest player of jigs he had ever heard. He injected a dynamic drive into every tune he played, achieving much of his attack by the use of very strong up-bows at points where most fiddlers would use a down-bow, producing some of the most rhythmic music around. Willie's playing has had a tremendous influence on musicians of my generation, and on Kathryn Tickell, Nancy Kerr and other younger performers. Many of the tunes he composed are now established favourites in the repertoire of musicians the length and breadth of the country. He recorded a solo album, Welcome To The Dene (1991) and with his fellow shepherds, the classic, Harthope Burn (1983). He is also featured on the Topic 20 CD set, Voice of the People (1998). He was born at Lilburn near Wooler, grew up in upper Coquetdale and lived all his life in north Northumberland. He learned to play fiddle as a youngster, but as a result of an accident while slicing turnips for the sheep, he lost the first finger of his left hand. He transferred his music-making to the melodeon and became a fine exponent on the box, but eventually returned to the fiddle and, with a single-minded tenacity that was characteristic of him, completely re-learned how to play, using his remaining fingers. As a young man, Willie worked alongside fellow hill shepherd Geordie Armstrong and lodged with him at High Bleakhope, an isolated cottage at the head of the Breamish valley. Geordie was also a fiddle player, and Willie always attributed his own style of playing to the hours they spent whiling away the long winter nights learning new tunes and going over old favourites until they achieved just the \"lift\" they wanted. Willie played mainly within his own community, walking miles over the hills to play at village dances, which would often continue through the night until it was light enough to walk back over the hills, arriving home just in time to start work the next day. All his working life was spent in the heart of the Cheviots, herding large flocks in wild hill country. He often had such a large area to cover that he used a pony to \"look\" the sheep, and it was while riding home after a hard day on the hills that he would work on the melody of his latest composition in his head, allowing the pony to find its own way home. The conversations in the car with Willie, Joe Hutton and Will Atkinson as we drove to engagements were always fascinating. We would start with a litany of every field we passed, discussing who had worked there, who they worked with, went to school with or were related to - keeping a mental map of their community and family links fresh in their minds. As we moved out of their home area, they would note any new agricultural practices - some of which would be welcomed whole-heartedly, others dismissed as short-term cost savings that would store up trouble for the future. A man of wide interests and a voracious reader of books of travel and exploration, Willie seemed to like to know how his corner of the Borders fitted into the jigsaw of the world. He would sit for hours reading an atlas and, although he travelled little himself, whenever he met someone who had been travelling abroad he would amaze them by his precise knowledge of the geography of some far distant land. A man of independent spirit, Willie took a deep interest in anything to which he turned his hand. His life was filled with the rhythms of the Borders: the yearly cycle of rearing sheep, the seasonal tasks of his highly productive garden and, of course, the rhythms and melodies of the music of the Borders. He will be greatly missed by lovers of traditional music throughout the country, but his music will live on. Willie is survived by his wife Nancy, son Neil, grand-daughters Kerry and Emma and great grand-daughters Lucy and Sumer. \u0095 William Cowans Taylor, shepherd and musician, born January 5 1916; died November 2 2000",

This change was not due solely, as is often suggested, to Sir William Glock and his team at the BBC. Even before the Glock ascendancy, these young composers, who had not yet made their mark, were studying in various parts of Europe, and they brought back new ideas, new techniques, and different aesthetics.</p> <p>Born and brought up in Sunderland, Sherlaw- Johnson went to Gosforth grammar school, Newcastle upon Tyne, was a student at the University of Durham from 1950-53, and studied piano and composition at the Royal Academy of Music from 1953-57. He then went to Paris to study composition with Nadia Boulanger, to attend Messiaen's epoch-defining analysis class at the Paris Conservatoire, and to study piano with Jacques F\u00e9vrier.</p> <p>At that time, Messiaen's music was little known in Britain, but Sherlaw-Johnson had phenomenal facility as a pianist, and was able to tackle some of the most demanding works in the repertory, including Messiaen's monumental cycle, the Vingt Regards sur l'Enfant J\u00e9sus, which he often performed (but never recorded). However, he did record the whole of Messiaen's Catalogue d'Oiseaux for solo piano, and Harawi (with the soprano Noelle Barker). His doctoral thesis on Messiaen's music (Leeds, 1970) was followed by his book Messiaen (1974, revised 1989), the first major study of Messiaen's music published in English. It remains a classic of an unusual kind, replete with the insights that can come when one composer retraces the steps of another.</p> <p>Inevitably, his work on Messiaen had an impact on his own music, and perhaps even more so on others' perception of it. Some early works show the influence of Messiaen, as well as of Var\u00e8se and Boulez, but later works transcend these influences. He leaves some important (and technically very demanding) piano works, including three piano sonatas, and Asterogenesis (1973). There is an opera (The Lambton Worm, 1977), and a Symphony (1999). Two works for soprano, piano and tape result from his notable collaboration with Noelle Barker: The Praises of Heaven and Earth, and Green Whispers of Gold.</p> <p>He also leaves a significant body of religious and liturgical pieces (he converted to Roman Catholicism), the most recent of which, a Mass, will be premiered next year. Sherlaw-Johnson held several teaching positions: Leeds University (1961-63); director of music at Bradford Girls' grammar school (1963-65); and the universities of York (1965-70) and Oxford (1970-99). Although he spent the last 30 years in Oxford, as university lecturer in music (latterly reader) and fellow of Worcester College, it should not be forgotten that he was a member of that \"Camelot\" of composers which Wilfred Mellers brought together at York in the 1960s (including Bernard Rands and David Blake). By comparison, Oxford was not known as a centre for composition, but Sherlaw-Johnson's arrival (succeeding Kenneth Leighton and Edmund Rubbra) certainly helped, and he was to act as mentor for many musicians who have passed through Oxford.</p> <p>In 1988, he was awarded the Oxford DMus, and was thus the only person in the country to have two \"earned\" higher doctorates of music.

      "body": "<p>There is a surefire way to tell how important a toss is; just watch the captains' reactions. Nasser Hussain's call of \"heads\" yesterday was followed immediately by his one-man stampede across the pitch to see the coin fall. Hussain said \"We'll bat\" almost before Moin Khan had realised he'd lost it. </p> <p>And so began England's biggest Test in years on a pitch tailor-made for the Pakistan spinners, all four of them if you include the debutant Qaiser Abbas, which was bound to turn almost from the first ball. That is why batting first was so crucial to England's hopes and the toss was seen to be so significant. </p> <p>Ever since spin proved England's undoing in the one-day series, Pakistan have waited for Hussain's men with a clutch of spinners ready to weave a web to sabotage their chances. Predictably Saqlain Mushtaq, the unorthodox off-spinner, proved England's chief antagonist yesterday. He is only 23 and this is just his 30th Test, but already Saqlain is a master of his art. The amount of off-spin he generates is prodigious at times, his change of pace is deceptive, and he varies his angle and position of delivery on the crease as much as that other fearsome off-spinner, the Sri Lankan Muthiah Muralitharan. </p> <p>If all this was not enough to perplex the England batsmen, Saqlain can also muster a mystery ball to furrow the brow of the best. This is the delivery that appears to be bowled with the same action as his off-spinner but in fact turns the other way, or goes straight on, quickens up and bounces a touch more. It seems that no matter how often you face him, or how fa miliar you are with his action, this ball will still catch you unawares. </p> <p>Graham Thorpe naturally knows the repertoire of his Surrey team-mate Saqlain better than most and plays him well. But this variation takes even him by surprise. Thorpe was nearly caught at silly point by Salim Elahi in the last 15 minutes of play yesterday, looking to leave a ball that should by rights have spun harmlessly away to the wicketkeeper.

      "bodyText": "There is a surefire way to tell how important a toss is; just watch the captains' reactions. Nasser Hussain's call of \"heads\" yesterday was followed immediately by his one-man stampede across the pitch to see the coin fall. Hussain said \"We'll bat\" almost before Moin Khan had realised he'd lost it. And so began England's biggest Test in years on a pitch tailor-made for the Pakistan spinners, all four of them if you include the debutant Qaiser Abbas, which was bound to turn almost from the first ball. That is why batting first was so crucial to England's hopes and the toss was seen to be so significant. Ever since spin proved England's undoing in the one-day series, Pakistan have waited for Hussain's men with a clutch of spinners ready to weave a web to sabotage their chances. Predictably Saqlain Mushtaq, the unorthodox off-spinner, proved England's chief antagonist yesterday. He is only 23 and this is just his 30th Test, but already Saqlain is a master of his art. The amount of off-spin he generates is prodigious at times, his change of pace is deceptive, and he varies his angle and position of delivery on the crease as much as that other fearsome off-spinner, the Sri Lankan Muthiah Muralitharan. If all this was not enough to perplex the England batsmen, Saqlain can also muster a mystery ball to furrow the brow of the best. This is the delivery that appears to be bowled with the same action as his off-spinner but in fact turns the other way, or goes straight on, quickens up and bounces a touch more. It seems that no matter how often you face him, or how fa miliar you are with his action, this ball will still catch you unawares. Graham Thorpe naturally knows the repertoire of his Surrey team-mate Saqlain better than most and plays him well. But this variation takes even him by surprise. Thorpe was nearly caught at silly point by Salim Elahi in the last 15 minutes of play yesterday, looking to leave a ball that should by rights have spun harmlessly away to the wicketkeeper. Instead the ball reared and went straight on, cannoning off pad and bat just short of Elahi, who was on his heels. Earlier Thorpe was dropped at slip by Abbas when he cut at Saqlain. After watching this it was no wonder that Saqlain managed to outfox Marcus Trescothick, Alec Stewart and Hussain, who charged down the pitch and slewed a catch to cover. Even Mike Atherton succumbed, sweeping Saqlain's mystery ball into square leg's hands, when the same shot to the off-spinning delivery would have sailed harmlessly away to fine leg. Spare a thought for Saqlain's compatriot in all this, Mushtaq Ahmed, who went wicketless. Before yesterday, these two had taken 297 wickets in 76 Tests between them, and they form a force that England did well to resist for most of the day. Mushtaq really deserved a wicket or two as he teased and tormented with his leg-breaks and googlies. The combination of the two different types of spinner, with all their variety, was an enticing prospect for the spectator, if not for the batsmen, and they will make fascinating viewing for the early part of the winter. A word of praise too for the umpires, Darrell Hair from Australia and the local Riazuddin, who did not put a foot wrong in the face of concerted but fair appealing from the Pakistanis. The umpire's job is at its most difficult with fielders clustered around the bat and regular appeals for catches close to the wicket, and both men performed admirably yesterday. The two sides will be hoping that standard is maintained throughout what promises to be a high-standard series all round.",

He finally settled on Saqlain's off-spin from the north and a mixture from the south. It proved decisive. </p> <p>Saqlain found his rhythm, removed Trescothick with the last ball of the opening over of his new spell, and by the day's close had added the wickets of Atherton, Stewart and Nasser Hussain, who came in down the order after receiving treatment on his back. </p> <p>In a spell of 15 overs, broken only by the tea interval, Saqlain took four for 19 and finished with four for 61 overall - deserved reward for bowling of the highest class. </p> <p>As a result, the day ended as an even contest. Much now depends on Graham Thorpe, dropped at slip by Qaiser Abbas off Saqlain when he was two during the course of almost two gritty hours at the crease, and Graeme Hick. To give their own spinners a chance, only a total of more than 300 will suffice. </p> <p>According to Atherton, the pitch offered a little help to the spinners all day and not dramatically more at the end than it had at the start. So the ease with which he and Trescothick played for the first two sessions may be a tribute to their preparation, which included much roughing of nets to try and replicate conditions. </p> <p>\"It is a different challenge here to that we are used to,\" Atherton explained. \"It is all very new for most of us. With spinners operating there are so many balls coming at you in a short space of time; it requires more intensive concentration. </p> <p>\"A key is to have a game plan but not to be too predetermined, to rely on instinct, to be aware of the field placings and to play on the hoof to some extent.\" </p> <p>Neither Atherton nor Trescothick used their feet.

But even given its friendly status, this match still represented a poor night for Scotland. The Australians confirmed their rather worrying superiority with a second goal after 66 minutes. Following Kevin Muscat's high cross on the right, none of the Scottish defence's two or three strapping sentries could respond, allowing David Zdrilic to drift in and head beyond Gould. It was a strike that hardly went against the grain of this match. Emerton, Australia's best player on the night, said: \"I thought it would be tougher but we played exceptionally well.\" Scotland (3-5-2): Gould; O'Neil, Dailly, Weir; Boyd, Burley, Ferguson, Cameron, Matteo; Dodds, Hutchison. Australia (4-4-2): Schwarzer; Muscat, Murphy, Popovic, Lazaridis; Emerton, Skoko, Okon, Tiatto; Agostino, Zdrilic. Referee: P Garibian (France). \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

A pair of lovers lose the plot of their initially decorous duet as the man tries to waddle along on his knees with his head rammed between his girlfriend's legs, and the woman in a subsequent confusion of erotic roles starts pounding her groin against his backside. Dancers sniff and rummage around each other's bodies like thieving dogs; they launch into flights of dance that lead nowhere and their bursts of hyperactivity, goaded by Gorecki's 2nd String Quartet, are stalled by fits of bewildered disorientation. </p> <p>Ek favours certain self- conscious oddities of style - duck-footed walks, waggling buttocks - that can seem like so many irksome jokes and there is a veneer of Chaplinesque goofiness that can overwhelm serious dance and psychology. </p> <p>The dancing in She Was Black may be dysfunctional but weird beauties blossom from its rich and witty bending of choreographic logic. And if the characters start out looking theatrically eccentric they become, increasingly, compellingly strange as Rambert's dancers get under the skins and into the steps of their characters with magnificent conviction. </p> <p>The company dance equally well in the revival of one of their old signature works, Christopher Bruce's Sergeant Early's Dreams. This setting of Irish, American and English folk songs was created in 1984 and, at first sight, Bruce's reflection of the mournful, ardent, comic stories contained within their lyrics may look homespun, even naive. Yet these are songs that Bruce clearly loved - and one of his greatest talents as a choreographer has always been to communicate the heart of his inspiration. </p> <p>Ballads like Barbara Allen and Geordie, performed live by the excellent Sergeant Early's Band, carry a potent emotional charge which is all the more intense for the half-disclosed secrecies of their narratives. </p> <p>And because Bruce's choreography is so direct (but also so much more knowing than it appears) the dancing always amplifies rather than muddies the effect. </p> <p>It is a work that makes Riverdance and all its Celtic fusion spin-offs look like so much cynical packaging. </p> <p>\u0095 Ends Saturday.

      "body": "<p>It is the new buzz in the world of banking, a fresh battleground in a fiercely competitive sector. It is about tapping the \"mass affluent.\" It might not trip off the tongue. It might even sound like a contradiction in terms. But Britain's big banks reckon one in 12 of the population falls into a mid-market wealthy category and they want a piece of it. </p> <p>To qualify as a member of the \"mass affluent,\" one has to have \u00a350,000 or so of spare cash and a will to do something useful with it, but a lack of certainty about quite what. </p> <p>Their ranks have no doubt been swollen by the dot.com rush, but bankers say such mid-market wealth is just as likely to have been amassed in the \"old economy\". As Tony Cohen, tax partner at Arthur Andersen, puts it, it is just that the advent of the e-era has awakened the financial industry to the trend. He claims his clients are more likely to be \"serial entrepreneurs\", creating companies and selling them on, in the old or new business world. </p> <p>The sudden awareness of this wealthy breed, however, has set the hares running, and this week Abbey National joined the ranks of banks hoping to tap the market. Apparently, having decided that its brand lacked the cachet, Abbey is creating a new name, Inscape, to try to win their business.

      "bodyText": "It is the new buzz in the world of banking, a fresh battleground in a fiercely competitive sector. It is about tapping the \"mass affluent.\" It might not trip off the tongue. It might even sound like a contradiction in terms. But Britain's big banks reckon one in 12 of the population falls into a mid-market wealthy category and they want a piece of it. To qualify as a member of the \"mass affluent,\" one has to have \u00a350,000 or so of spare cash and a will to do something useful with it, but a lack of certainty about quite what. Their ranks have no doubt been swollen by the dot.com rush, but bankers say such mid-market wealth is just as likely to have been amassed in the \"old economy\". As Tony Cohen, tax partner at Arthur Andersen, puts it, it is just that the advent of the e-era has awakened the financial industry to the trend. He claims his clients are more likely to be \"serial entrepreneurs\", creating companies and selling them on, in the old or new business world. The sudden awareness of this wealthy breed, however, has set the hares running, and this week Abbey National joined the ranks of banks hoping to tap the market. Apparently, having decided that its brand lacked the cachet, Abbey is creating a new name, Inscape, to try to win their business. This unit is being formed despite the fact that Abbey already owns a traditional private bank catering for the well-off, Cater Allen. The idea is to offer rather more than a regular current account, developing a deeper relationship and offering a broader range of services such as fund management. To create the new image, Abbey chose the plush surroundings of Mayfair for the launch of Inscape, which will have a presence on the internet but will also have advice centres where \"clients\" - rather than boring, traditional \"customers\" - can speak to someone face to face. Abbey's approach is one of many being tested by the banks, which have been forced by government to offer basic accounts for people on low incomes or those with poor credit ratings. They would much rather be wooing the growing numbers of people who have gained most from the years of economic growth, rising incomes and (until a few months ago) surging stock markets. Barclays' attempt to reward its well-heeled customers with special deals, implemented this month, involves cutting personal loan rates for those with good track records in managing their finances. Such measures should have an impact much wider than Abbey's push for wealthy custom but demonstrates that there is a variety of approaches. Royal Bank of Scotland is also making a fresh push through Coutts, the \"Queen's bankers\" which it acquired with NatWest this year. Even the most discreet and rarefied in the business of upmarket banking - the Swiss - are moving down-market a little to widen their client-base. Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, Switzerland's second biggest bank, last week showed it was ready to tolerate less than uniformly blue blood by introducing an investment and banking service targeting a larger pool of people - the 7m Brits with \u00a330,000-plus of \"invested assets\". Cr\u00e9dit Suisse's Global Investor Portfolio account, which is predominantly seeking customers who are internet savvy, allows people to hold cash in up to four currencies, deal shares on 15 stock markets and buy unit trusts from an \"investment supermarket\". The seriously wealthy and reclusive superstar may not be all that excited - the minimum opening amount is a relatively modest \u00a3600. Analysts believe the biggest impact in this contest will come from HSBC and its American partner Merrill Lynch, which in April pledged to launch a joint online banking and investment services venture.

He has retained a 32% stake, worth some \u00a3275m at last night's closing share price. </p> <p>EasyJet's flying start on the stockmarket contrasts sharply with its larger rival British Airways. It announced last week that it was pulling out of the no-frills airline business and putting its loss-making Go subsidiary up for sale. </p> <p>EasyJet - which BA tried to buy just a year after it started flights from its Luton base - is one of the success stories of the skies. Last year it carried 5.6m passengers and made a profit of \u00a322m. BA's Go carried 1.9m passengers last year and lost more than \u00a321m. </p> <p>The low cost carrier will use the money it raised from the stock market - about \u00a3200m - to buy more jets for its fleet, a move seen as a shot across the bows of its rivals. </p> <p>With its trademark orange livery, easyJet has helped revolutionise short-haul travel for UK passengers. Passengers are given no food, no tickets and no pre-allocated seats, but they do enjoy much cheaper fares than on the traditional full service airlines. </p> <p>When easyJet launched many questioned Mr Haji-Ioannou's philosophy, to which he pithily replied: \"If you want a meal, go to a restaurant.\" </p> <p><strong> Eliminated</strong><br> </p> <p> The airline industry had seen nothing like it since the days of Freddie Laker's Skytrain. Travel agents - and the commission they require for selling seats - were eliminated, with all bookings made direct. Nearly 80% of easyJet passengers now book on the internet. </p> <p>In November 1995 Mr Haji-Ioannou had one plane, one route - London to Scotland - and a loudly trumpeted \u00a329 fare, which was exactly one 10th of the price BA was demanding for the same journey. </p> <p>Now he operates a fleet of 18 Boeing 737s, serving 28 routes, and has 32 new aircraft on order. As some planes are replaced easyJet plans to have a fleet of 44 aircraft by 2004. </p> <p>It now has hubs in Liverpool and Geneva as well as Luton and is developing Amsterdam as a fourth hub. </p> <p>However, it has no plans to move into low-cost long-haul flights, which would require different aircraft and the \"expensive\" business of putting two pilots on each flight. </p> <p>The company - which Mr Haji-Ioannou started when he became bored with running a branch of the family shipping business in Athens - has doubled in size every year since its first flight in 1995 and its founder has become one of the UK's most high-profile businessmen. </p> <p>In part this is thanks to his flair for publicity. He memorably took out full page adverts attacking Bob Ayling, the then boss of BA, and Barbara Cassani, who runs Go, as \"the beauty and the beast\". </p> <p>More recently he has launched a campaign against Luton airport claiming that it was charging easyJet too much for the right to take off and land. </p> <p>Again he loudly proclaimed to the media that Luton's big shareholder, Barclays, had placed a \"\u00a35 tax on passenger's tickets\". </p> <p>Despite his penchant for publicity the day-to-day running of easyJet is in the hands of chief executive Ray Webster, a former Air New Zealand executive. He has a 1% stake in the company now worth some \u00a38m. </p> <p>The shares began trading at 310p and quickly rose to 342p. Small investors were \"locked out\" of the flotation, but big City investors scrambled to buy the shares in the airline. </p> <p>They were willing to buy nine times the number of shares on offer. </p> <p>Mr Haji-Ioannou, whose brother and sister own 32% of the airline, said: \"We are delighted by the high level of interest and support that institutional shareholders have shown.\" </p> <p>All EasyJet's employees benefited from the float. Around 1,000 junior staff, including call centre operators and cabin crew, were given free packages of around 700 shares. Last night those packages were worth nearly \u00a32,400. </p> <p>But many senior staff and management have made much bigger gains on share options. The company's pilots were each given the right to buy around 25,000 shares at 182p each. Those options are now worth some \u00a340,000. And several senior directors were given larger option packages which have turned them into paper millionaires. </p> <p>The staff must keep their shares for between one and two years before they can take their profits. </p> <p><strong>Underdog who wins</strong></p> <p>Like Sir Richard Branson, Stelios Haji-Ioannou revels in being the underdog. </p> <p>It is not the only similarity between the two. Like the Virgin chief, Mr Haji-Ioannou is a high-profile frontman. Behind both are deputies running their businesses, neither is frightened to march into court to protect his interests, and both have an eye for cheeky publicity stunts. </p> <p>When British Airways launched its low-cost carrier, go, Mr Haji-Ioannou made a block booking on the inaugural flight - and he and his staff turned up in easyJet's trademark orange sweatshirts to take the limelight. </p> <p>EasyJet is a dress-down operation. Ties are banned at the group's Luton base and Mr Haji-Ioannou has a desk in the vast open-plan office. </p> <p>Virgin-style, he is now stretching the \"easy\" branding. There is easyRentacar and easyEverything, a chain of internet cafes. </p> <p><strong>Chasing the cheap flight millions</strong></p> <p><strong> <a href=\"http://www.ryanair.com\">www.ryanair.com</a></strong></p> <p>Europe's biggest low-cost airline started flying in 1985 with one daily flight in a 15-seater from Waterford in Ireland to Gatwick. Today it carries some 7m passengers a year on 45 routes to destinations in 11 countries, and its staff number 1,400. </p> <p>The company - started by the wealthy Ryan family - now is run by Michael O'Leary, an ebullient former accountant. Ryanair is listed on the Dublin stock exchange with a valuation of \u00a32.1bn, about half the current value of British Airways. </p> <p>The carrier has 35 Boeing 737s on order, to add to its fleet of 31.

Last year easyJet's orange planes flew 5.6m passengers on 18 European routes and made a \u00a322.1m profit. </p> <p>Yesterday's float values the company at more than \u00a3850m - and the Haji-Ioannou family's 64% stake at more than\u00a3500m.</p> <p><strong> <a href=\"http://www.go-fly.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.go-fly.com</a></strong></p> <p>The British Airways subsidiary, Go, was put up for sale last week. </p> <p>It was started in 1998 in response to easyJet and Ryanair and is run by Bar-bara Cassani (above), a US-born former BA executive.
