      "body": "<p>The room was bare and cramped. Outside, in an echoing tunnel, the police and security men had gathered. Even an hour before a routine Premiership afternoon turned serious, they were prepared for trouble. As the clock ticked towards three, the noise of a growing crowd seeped through the closed door. </p> <p>Inside their tiny box, by 2.45pm, the four officials in charge of West Ham's game against Bradford City had changed into their familiar uniforms. They waited quietly for the moment when, as referee, Neale Barry reached for the buzzer which sounded in the adjoining dressing rooms. </p> <p>In the depths of an enduring crisis surrounding Premiership officiating, there was just enough time for Barry and his assistants to reflect a little longer. They knew they would be the first to be insulted and blamed by 22 bawling players, a couple of indignant managers and 25,000 vociferous supporters. \"We're easy targets,\" Barry said. \"We accept it because that's football.</p> <p>The minute you pass your Class 3 exam and take your first game in the parks your skin starts to thicken. A lot of the abuse is no different from years ago. So saying that we're less understood now implies that we were understood in the first place. I don't think we've ever been understood or valued. </p> <p>\"But refereeing in the Premiership this season has certainly been far less enjoyable. In the old first division there used to be two cameras for Match Of The Day. Now Sky have 18. Every gesture I make will be seen by millions. And it seems, because of that scrutiny, everyone is jumping on the bandwagon.\" </p> <p>Keith Hackett, a former international ref who has since become Barry's coach and an observer of refereeing standards in the Premiership, nodded wryly. Hackett has always been a big man and, in such a small space, he loomed large. But he almost shuddered when he stressed: \"Christ, I wouldn't want to be a referee today...\" </p> <p>Considering how Hackett had amused us with dark tales of how a death threat had once been issued against him at West Ham, his emphatic denial that he missed refereeing carried real resonance. He had also been at the centre of the infamous brawl between Arsenal and Manchester United in 1990 which resulted in points being docked from both clubs. He has not become timid in retirement. Yet the fevered atmosphere of the Premiership is even less forgiving. </p> <p>\"The culture has changed,\" Hackett argued. \"The traditional spectator used to pay his money and if his team lost he wanted to blame someone; the referee was the obvious culprit. There was nothing untoward in that; by Sunday it would be out of his system. But now these feelings roll on as the media feeds off itself. It's becoming an impossible situation. </p> <p>\"As referees we must join the debate. It's incumbent on us to help the public understand the intricacies of our job. We're trying to encourage referees to explain themselves. Instead of saying 'No comment' it's better they say this is the reason for that decision. But there seems to be a fog over the game...\" </p> <p>Although Hackett insisted that \"the standard of officiating is far better than when I was a ref\", excruciating gaffes have recently eroded refereeing credibility. Yet amid the justified calls for referees to be made accountable for their errors, a more disturbing trend has re-emerged. </p> <p>\"The way in which Manchester United players surrounded Andy d'Urso,\" Barry suggested, \"was appalling. But compared to the manner in which they whipped up the Tranmere and Mike Reed incidents, it seemed that the mass confrontation at Old Trafford was cut off at the stocking-tops by the media.\" </p> <p>Within 90 minutes of Barry's lament, the behaviour of United's players again prompted intense media interest; Stephen Lodge, another referee coached by Hackett, had the difficult chore of trying to police United's attempts to corrode his authority during their 3-0 defeat by Newcastle.</p> <p>But that was nothing compared with the ugly skirmishes that tarnished Elland Road and Stamford Bridge, and resulted in Leeds, Tottenham, Chelsea and Wimbledon being charged with misconduct by the FA on Monday. </p> <p>Barry's own \"challenge\", as he charitably described his encounter with Paolo di Canio, Igor Stimac and the rest, was at least leavened by a nine-goal thriller. It helped that, as he awaited the arrival of Harry Redknapp and Paul Jewell with their team-sheets, Barry regarded the managers \"as two of the reasonable ones. They might make a sarcastic comment but they won't start ranting and raving. </p> <p>\"If you look at Gordon Strachan, Martin O'Neill and George Graham, it's cabaret. They play to the crowd. It's as if they want to show their fans and directors that they're emotionally involved. But we all have to be honest; everyone makes mistakes. After the Chelsea-Tottenham game I got home at 3am and put on a video of the match. I decided then I shouldn't have cautioned Steffen Iversen. I phoned the FA the next morning and told them to rescind the caution.\" </p> <p>Graham, at least, acknowledged Barry's courage in changing his decision. \"He didn't admire me at all,\" Barry snorted. \"It was just a public relations exercise [for him]...\" </p> <p>Across such a suspicious divide, managers and players increasingly question the officials whose control they are meant to accept. \"What is the point of referees?\" Stimac asked on Saturday after Barry had rejected Di Canio's first three penalty appeals. Two of those judgments were undoubtedly correct but, for Stimac and Di Canio, Barry's refusal to cede to their demands was indicative of a \"vendetta\" against the Italian. </p> <p>When asked before the game if players such as Di Canio became victims of their own reputation, Barry murmured: \"You'd be an idiot as a referee not to notice individuals. When you prepare for any match you know some players are more likely to cause problems.\" </p> <p>It was impossible not to notice Di Canio. Apart from opening up Bradford's defence at will, he screamed constantly at Barry. With Bradford leading 4-2 he took off his shirt and pleaded to be substituted when another penalty was declined. Yet, when Barry pointed later at the spot, Di Canio and Frank Lampard wrestled over the ball like petulant seven-year-olds. After Barry's intervention, Di Canio scored to spark West Ham's stunning 5-4 win. </p> <p>Yet a darker strain had swept through the tunnel at half-time. As Barry and his assistants rushed for the dressing room only seconds after a Bradford penalty levelled the score at 2-2, a policeman urgently requested back-up. </p> <p>\"You never know what might happen,\" he muttered into his walkie-talkie, \"if the players go for the ref.\" </p> <p>\"To be fair,\" Barry countered afterwards, \"the rapport was good for most of the match.\" </p> <p>As for Di Canio's more singular rapport, Barry laughed. \"I've no idea what he was saying. It was in Italian. But he understands English. I said, 'I don't care what you say in Italian, but if you wave your arms around once more I'll give you a yellow card.' </p> <p>\"When you have a split-second to decide whether to show a card or award a penalty it's a gut reaction. I don't care if they pay me \u00a310,000 or \u00a310 as a referee [the Premiership match fee is \u00a3600], I'd still make the same decisions.\" </p> <p>Hackett had suggested that appointing a number of fully professional referees was the most logical way of undermining dissent on the pitch. </p> <p>\"We have to move that way,\" Hackett emphasised, \"because I don't think there's any perception as to how much time and effort it takes for referees to reach this level - and for such relatively small reward. They're not in it for the money but they shouldn't have to worry about money.\" </p> <p>At five o'clock on Saturday, a shirtless Neale Barry looked as though he couldn't care less about money as he conjured up an expression to match the curious Mr Happy underpants he had chosen to wear for his Upton Park cracker. </p> <p>In his own ordinary life he was a 41-year-old planner with British Steel. It was a safe bet that his daily routine in his \"proper job\" could not rival Saturday's sheer adrenalin rush - despite a massed West Ham protest which almost pinned him to an advertising hoarding. </p> <p>\"The good thing,\" Barry enthused, \"was that I didn't back off. I found neutral ground on the goal-line and put my arm out. It held them off. I was really pleased with my performance. Even the booing just made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I said to myself, 'You're in a game here.' I'd rather have that kind of match than a 0-0 where nothing happens.\" </p> <p>The war elsewhere sounded like it was being lost, but the refereeing world's own Mr Happy had survived more than another battle. He looked as if he had fallen in love with football all over again. </p> <p>\"Five-four!\" Barry marvelled. \"That was a game of English football. Di Canio won't see that in Italy. He might be crazy but he can play all right - as can a few others. Weren't there some marvellous strikes out there? Great goals, great game. That'll do for me...\"</p>",

After the 35th over they were 135 for five, and still one run behind the hosts. If terminal rain had fallen then Zimbabwe would have won. </p> <p>It was at this stage that Hick, rather like a golfer filling in his card, took a piece of paper from his pocket to work out exactly what was required. He and Mark Ealham then attacked the bowling, particularly the left-arm spin of Dirk Viljoen. After a drinks break between the 37th and 38th overs, everyone was so confused that the batsmen returned to the wrong ends, with Ealham taking strike when it should have been Hick. </p> <p>Ultimately, though, it was Hick's day. In his first international appearance for England in the country of his birth, he scored a commanding 87 not out from 108 deliveries, with four fours and two sixes. He needed this. In the recent triangular series in South Africa he scored only 62 in five innings, and in seven matches against Zimbabwe had made 78 runs at an average of 13. </p> <p>He had to be at his best because England's batting again showed its traditional soft centre after the openers Nasser Hussain and Nick Knight had both chopped on. </p> <p>Hick and Darren Maddy put on 53 for the third wicket in 12 overs but then three wickets fell for 19 runs. First Maddy paddled Grant Flower round to short fine leg for a belligerent 24. Then a nervous Vikram Solanki, back at the expense of Mark Alleyne, was bowled for 11 as he tried to force the same bowler through the off side, having been dropped on eight. </p> <p>England looked in deep trouble at 109 for five when Craig White was well caught by Olonga for a duck. But Ealham, who scored a four and a six in his 46-ball knock of 36, provided the support Hick needed, and the pair added 90 runs in as many balls. </p> <p>Hussain said afterwards: \"I'm delighted for Graeme. He showed what a tremendous player he can be. He and Mark played really well.\" Hick admitted: \"The pressure was on but the Duckworth-Lewis thing gave some urgency to our batting when it was needed.\" </p> <p>Earlier Zimbabwe, who won the toss, scored 194 for seven on a typically slow pitch. Neil Johnson and Alistair Campbell gave them a good start but their best innings was played by Grant Flower. </p> <p>He had struggled recently when opening the batting but playing down the order, alongside his brother Andy, he flourished by scoring an unbeaten 55 from 63 deliveries. </p> <p>White was the best of the England bowlers, picking up a wicket in each of his first two overs. Bowling with real pace at times and with clever use of the slower ball at others, he finished with figures of three for 29 from nine overs.

      "body": "<p>So Paul Gascoigne is out of the reckoning now for the England match against Argentina next week. If he had had even a half-decent game against Villa on Monday and left the pitch with his limbs intact, there would have been at least a murmur demanding his inclusion. </p> <p>He is the most gifted English footballer of the past 30 years. He can turn a game in a moment. We have seen him: for Tottenham in their 1991 FA Cup run, for England in Euro 96, as a youngster at Newcastle. And we want him to do it again. Deluded fools that we are, we even think it a possibility. We think that this time Gazza will not be Gazza. </p> <p>But he always is. Daft as a brush, Bobby Robson called him, and it has turned out to be one of the kinder assessments. There are five pages of quotes about Gazza in Phil Shaw's Book of Football Quotations, from Richard Littlejohn's dismissive depiction of him as \"a man capable of going three rounds with a urinal\" to Danny Baker's view that Gazza is all right really, because he always \"washes his own cereal bowl\" chez Baker. But Robson had les mots justes on the subject. </p> <p>Only Steve Jacobs, an alcohol addiction counsellor, comes closer to capturing the essence of the footballer. \"The pattern of Gascoigne's life is terrifying,\" he said. \"If his behaviour continues, the boy... will end up in the gutter, in prison or he will die. If he doesn't change, I'm certain he will never celebrate his 40th birthday.\" </p> <p>Jacobs's rumblings should be tempered by the obligatory spell Gascoigne has since spent in the Priory Clinic (the BBC should send a camera crew there; they could make Shooting Stars and A Question of Sport on the same trip) but the self-destructive streak the counsellor identified survives. What other explanation could there be for Gazza's extraordinary behaviour on Monday night? </p> <p>He always did bustle in midfield, arms akimbo - his vigorous, barely legal use of the elbows helped give him his edge - but he must have known that going further and aiming the elbow at George Boateng would get him into serious trouble, especially after a weekend of Premiership indiscipline that had the FA talking of tough action against offenders. </p> <p>Edgar Allan Poe once wrote a story called The Imp Of The Perverse, in which the hero was unable to remain on the straight and narrow because every time his life appeared to be running smoothly a strange and irresistible impulse would come over him to do something wicked or stupid. It could have been written for Gazza. </p> <p>So what now? He will not end up in the gutter. Our addiction counsellor friend, on a social worker's pay, can probably not conceive of the immense riches even a dunderhead such as Gazza can derive from a partially successful career as a footballer. </p> <p> M illionaires tend not to end up in the gutter and, unlike George Best, Gazza will not even need to spend his Saturday afternoons watching the footy on Sky TV. </p> <p>His agent Mel Stein reckons he will be back playing Premiership football in four weeks, but then Stein is probably also in negotiations for a Frank Sinatra comeback tour. </p> <p>A more likely outcome will see Gazza finishing his career in the United States where, as luck would have it, there is a resurgence of interest in soccer after the success of the American women's team and the release of two feature films with a soccer theme. But do not bet against Gazza lousing up the whole deal by arriving in Harlem blind drunk wearing a comedy Ku Klux Klan outfit. </p> <p>Another wayward star who might have to learn a new set of social conventions is Ian Wright, who may well make his debut for Burnley on Saturday against Wigan. Turf Moor, remember, was for years the domain of the meat-pie magnate Bob Lord, who dubbed the 60s Manchester United team \"a bunch of teddy boys\" because of their dangerous habit of combing their hair \"duck's-arse\" style (all except Bobby Charlton, of course).

      "bodyText": "So Paul Gascoigne is out of the reckoning now for the England match against Argentina next week. If he had had even a half-decent game against Villa on Monday and left the pitch with his limbs intact, there would have been at least a murmur demanding his inclusion. He is the most gifted English footballer of the past 30 years. He can turn a game in a moment. We have seen him: for Tottenham in their 1991 FA Cup run, for England in Euro 96, as a youngster at Newcastle. And we want him to do it again. Deluded fools that we are, we even think it a possibility. We think that this time Gazza will not be Gazza. But he always is. Daft as a brush, Bobby Robson called him, and it has turned out to be one of the kinder assessments. There are five pages of quotes about Gazza in Phil Shaw's Book of Football Quotations, from Richard Littlejohn's dismissive depiction of him as \"a man capable of going three rounds with a urinal\" to Danny Baker's view that Gazza is all right really, because he always \"washes his own cereal bowl\" chez Baker. But Robson had les mots justes on the subject. Only Steve Jacobs, an alcohol addiction counsellor, comes closer to capturing the essence of the footballer. \"The pattern of Gascoigne's life is terrifying,\" he said. \"If his behaviour continues, the boy... will end up in the gutter, in prison or he will die. If he doesn't change, I'm certain he will never celebrate his 40th birthday.\" Jacobs's rumblings should be tempered by the obligatory spell Gascoigne has since spent in the Priory Clinic (the BBC should send a camera crew there; they could make Shooting Stars and A Question of Sport on the same trip) but the self-destructive streak the counsellor identified survives. What other explanation could there be for Gazza's extraordinary behaviour on Monday night? He always did bustle in midfield, arms akimbo - his vigorous, barely legal use of the elbows helped give him his edge - but he must have known that going further and aiming the elbow at George Boateng would get him into serious trouble, especially after a weekend of Premiership indiscipline that had the FA talking of tough action against offenders. Edgar Allan Poe once wrote a story called The Imp Of The Perverse, in which the hero was unable to remain on the straight and narrow because every time his life appeared to be running smoothly a strange and irresistible impulse would come over him to do something wicked or stupid. It could have been written for Gazza. So what now? He will not end up in the gutter. Our addiction counsellor friend, on a social worker's pay, can probably not conceive of the immense riches even a dunderhead such as Gazza can derive from a partially successful career as a footballer. M illionaires tend not to end up in the gutter and, unlike George Best, Gazza will not even need to spend his Saturday afternoons watching the footy on Sky TV. His agent Mel Stein reckons he will be back playing Premiership football in four weeks, but then Stein is probably also in negotiations for a Frank Sinatra comeback tour. A more likely outcome will see Gazza finishing his career in the United States where, as luck would have it, there is a resurgence of interest in soccer after the success of the American women's team and the release of two feature films with a soccer theme. But do not bet against Gazza lousing up the whole deal by arriving in Harlem blind drunk wearing a comedy Ku Klux Klan outfit. Another wayward star who might have to learn a new set of social conventions is Ian Wright, who may well make his debut for Burnley on Saturday against Wigan. Turf Moor, remember, was for years the domain of the meat-pie magnate Bob Lord, who dubbed the 60s Manchester United team \"a bunch of teddy boys\" because of their dangerous habit of combing their hair \"duck's-arse\" style (all except Bobby Charlton, of course). The Burnley winger John Connelly now runs a fish and chip shop, a retirement option one suspects Wright has not considered. Things have changed in Burnley, but not that much. The Manchester poet John Cooper Clark says: \"My manager says I'm too sophisticated to appear in Burnley or anywhere else where they still point at aeroplanes.\"",

It also found that there were incidents of sexual abuse of girl residents, though they were comparatively rare. Physical and sexual abuse of young residents in the neighbouring county of Gwynedd also occurred.</p> <p>Local authority homes in Clwyd most affected were Bryn Estyn, where two senior officers, Peter Howarth and Stephen Norris, sexually assaulted and buggered boys over a 10-year period and Cartrefle, where Norris continued to abuse boys from 1984 until his arrest in June 1990. The tribunal also found evidence of sexual abuse at Little Acton assessment centre, Bersham Hall, Chevet Hey and Upper Downing. And there was widespread sexual abuse of boys in private residential establishments in the Clwyd area and abuse of children in five foster homes.</p> <p>The report also found physical abuse and the unacceptable use of force in six local authority community homes in Clwyd. Once again, Bryn Estyn was the worst offender. It had \"a harsh institutional regime in which, for many, there was a heavy atmosphere of fear\".</p> <p><b> 'Grossly poisoned'</b><br></p> <p>About 140 former residents of Bryn Estyn between 1974 and 1984 made allegations of physical or sexual abuse and the inquiry listened to the evidence of 48 of them. The overwhelming majority of complaints were made against Peter Howarth, assistant then deputy principal at the home.</p> <p>The report found: \"The lives of these already disturbed children were grossly poisoned by a leading authority figure in whom they should have been able to place their trust. They felt soiled, guilty and embarrassed and some of them were led to question their own sexual orientation. Most of them have experienced difficulties in their sexual relationships and their relationships with children ever since and many have continued to rebel against authority. Even more seriously, their self-respect and ability to look forward to the future have been shattered.\"</p> <p>Howarth invented a regime at the home where he would post a flat list which named boys who were invited to his flat for recreation. Staff did not remark on its inappropriateness, leading the inquiry to conclude that there was a conspiracy of silence.</p> <p>\"It was Howarth's daily practice to invite resident boys, usually from the main building, to his flat in the late evening for drinks (including some alcohol) and light food for the privilege of watching television and for other recreation such as playing cards, board games etc ... Attendance was part of the agreed programme of activities available to boys in the evening and the names of those attending would be entered into the activities log. The sessions would begin at about 8.30pm and the boys attending, usually five or six or even more at a time, were required to dress in their pyjamas without any underwear. If they were wearing underpants under their pyjamas, they were ordered to remove them.\"</p> <p>The inquiry discovered that Howarth had a number of favourites, known as \"bum boys\" and it was they who were the main victims of his sexual assaults. The report says: \"They would be detained on some pretext when others were leaving, at which point, buggery or some indecency would occur. Quite often, however, similar conduct would occur in the kitchen of the flat, for example, whilst others were still present in another room watching television.\"</p> <p>Howarth was convicted in July 1994 of one offence of buggery and seven indecent assaults and received a total of 10 years in prison. He died in April 1997. Stephen Norris's offences at Bryn Estyn and other homes were of similar nature to Howarth's but his method of operation was different. The report found he was \"a coarse man of poor general education who should never have been placed in charge of a unit providing for the needs of immature and disturbed boys\".</p> <p>Norris pleaded guilty in November 1993 to three offences of buggery, an attempted buggery and three indecent assaults involving three former Bryn Estyn boys and received seven years in prison. He had already served 3 years in prison imposed in October 1990 for sexual offences committed at Cartrefle.</p> <p>The report concludes that for two senior members of staff to be habitually engaged in major sexual abuse of many of the young residents without detection was \"truly appalling\".</p> <p>Applauding the bravery of those who gave testimony to the inquiry, the tribunal lays the blame for the failure to detect the abusers at the doors of a number of agencies. Staff at the homes were criticised for their failure to blow the whistle on their colleagues. It found there were few complaints of abuse from the children in the homes because they were discouraged from doing so. There were no procedures in any of the establishments to enable members of staff to voice concerns.</p> <p>The inquiry also found that social services failed to provide at the most senior level effective and positive leadership to ensure that the first consideration was the welfare of the child. Senior management was subject to frequent changes and was confused and defective.</p> <p>There were no coherent arrangements by Clwyd social services for the management, support and monitoring of their care homes which allowed Bryn Estyn, in particular, to be run without any guidance.</p> <p>The Welsh office comes in for a great deal of blame, with the report saying it \"cannot absolve itself of ultimate responsibility for the fate of children in care by referring to legislation that successive governments themselves initiated from time to time, whether or not with expert advice\". It discovered that \"lack of leadership\" in the Welsh office meant \"forward planning was allowed to wither and die\".</p> <p>The tribunal also concluded that central government must bear responsibility for what happened. It said that for more than half the period under review children's services were given insufficient priority, including a failure to take action before the children act 1989 to regulate private children's homes and a failure to take steps to ensure that adequate facilities were made available for the training of residential child care workers.</p> <p>The tribunal found that the police investigation of child abuse in Clwyd from 1991 was carried out \"thoroughly\" and \"sensitively\".</p> <p>The report, however, criticises investigations into complaints about Gwynedd made by care home head Alison Taylor. The police work, it says, was \"sluggish and shallow\" and \"seriously defective\". The role played by Det Supt Gwynne Owen was inappropriate and the size of the investigating team inadequate. There was no liaison with social services and relevant documents were not seized.</p> <p>The inquiry found no evidence of a paedophile ring in north Wales which was said to have involved high-profile public figures but said it had very little documentary evidence to go on. It had no evidence \"to establish that there was a wide-ranging conspiracy involving prominent persons and others with the objective of sexual activity with children in care\".</p> <p>There was nothing to suggest there was a paedophile ring operating recruitment at Bryn Estyn. But there was a paedophile ring in the Wrexham and Chester areas \"in the sense that there were a number of male persons, many of them known to each other, who were engaged in paedophile activities and were targeting young males in their middle teens\".</p> <p><b> Recommendations </b><br></p> <p>The report makes 72 recommendations. An independent commissioner for Wales should be appointed to ensure children's rights through the monitoring and oversight of the operation of complaints and whistleblowing procedures and the arrangements for children's advocacy.</p> <p>Every social services authority should be required to appoint an appropriately qualified or experienced children's complaints officer to act in the best interests of the child.</p> <p>An abused child should not be transferred to another placement unless it is in the child's best interests.</p> <p>Every local authority should promote awareness by children and staff of its complaints procedures for looked-after children and the importance of applying them without any threat or fear of reprisals.</p> <p>There should be the establishment and implementation of conscientiously clear whistleblowing procedures.

      "body": "<p>Accountability and flexibility will be the watchwords when Geoff Miller is appointed today as an England selector. The former Derbyshire and England all-rounder will join the England captain Nasser Hussain, the coach Duncan Fletcher and the chairman David Graveney on a four-man panel which will oversee a packed international summer which includes a total of seven Test matches against Zimbabwe and West Indies and 10 one-day internationals. </p> <p>Miller is a dry, deadpan individual who makes more than a crust speaking on the after-dinner circuit, and it is the availability that stems from this which has prompted his surprise elevation. </p> <p>His brief will be to watch and assess the performances of players in county cricket. International commitments make that impossible to any meaningful degree for Hussain or Fletcher, likewise to a lesser extent for Graveney despite the possibility that he will restrict his involvement during Tests to preparation and the first day. </p> <p>The search for a fourth selector, instigated at the behest of captain and coach, embraced players past and present, umpires and the media. One popular, if fanciful, suggestion was Ian Botham, who had been acting as an official adviser to the selectors. </p> <p>However, it was felt that the great majority, including Botham and others involved in the game itself or through the media, would be too bound by their schedules to be flexible enough to go to a particular match at 24 hours' notice. </p> <p>Most of those with the time and inclination, on the other hand, did not fit into the prescribed age bracket. Miller has indicated he would have no problem over availability, and at 47 he is younger than the chairman and only a year older than a previous incumbent, Graham Gooch. </p> <p>An early task will be to nominate the players to be awarded central England contracts for the next season, with an announcement due this month. There could be as many as 16, but no more than 10 or 11 are expected. </p> <p>The timing may be problematical, because unless the selectors have licence this summer to choose as many of their Test side as necessary from outside those contracted - something that will not sit kindly with the counties, many of then critical of what they see as extravagant use of board income - they are effectively being asked to select sides in February. </p> <p>It has yet to be decided whether contracts should be awarded strictly on merit: in other words, on the basis of past performance and an established place in the international framework, as with Mike Atherton and Alec Stewart. Or should recognition be given both to the potential of up-and-coming players and the welfare in particular of promising fast bowlers such as Alex Tudor and Steve Harmison? Noses are sure to be put out of joint. </p> <p>\u0095The former England seamer Mike Hendrick has been appointed Scotland's coach.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Accountability and flexibility will be the watchwords when Geoff Miller is appointed today as an England selector. The former Derbyshire and England all-rounder will join the England captain Nasser Hussain, the coach Duncan Fletcher and the chairman David Graveney on a four-man panel which will oversee a packed international summer which includes a total of seven Test matches against Zimbabwe and West Indies and 10 one-day internationals. Miller is a dry, deadpan individual who makes more than a crust speaking on the after-dinner circuit, and it is the availability that stems from this which has prompted his surprise elevation. His brief will be to watch and assess the performances of players in county cricket. International commitments make that impossible to any meaningful degree for Hussain or Fletcher, likewise to a lesser extent for Graveney despite the possibility that he will restrict his involvement during Tests to preparation and the first day. The search for a fourth selector, instigated at the behest of captain and coach, embraced players past and present, umpires and the media. One popular, if fanciful, suggestion was Ian Botham, who had been acting as an official adviser to the selectors. However, it was felt that the great majority, including Botham and others involved in the game itself or through the media, would be too bound by their schedules to be flexible enough to go to a particular match at 24 hours' notice. Most of those with the time and inclination, on the other hand, did not fit into the prescribed age bracket. Miller has indicated he would have no problem over availability, and at 47 he is younger than the chairman and only a year older than a previous incumbent, Graham Gooch. An early task will be to nominate the players to be awarded central England contracts for the next season, with an announcement due this month. There could be as many as 16, but no more than 10 or 11 are expected. The timing may be problematical, because unless the selectors have licence this summer to choose as many of their Test side as necessary from outside those contracted - something that will not sit kindly with the counties, many of then critical of what they see as extravagant use of board income - they are effectively being asked to select sides in February. It has yet to be decided whether contracts should be awarded strictly on merit: in other words, on the basis of past performance and an established place in the international framework, as with Mike Atherton and Alec Stewart. Or should recognition be given both to the potential of up-and-coming players and the welfare in particular of promising fast bowlers such as Alex Tudor and Steve Harmison? Noses are sure to be put out of joint. \u0095The former England seamer Mike Hendrick has been appointed Scotland's coach.",

Action was being taken to ensure there could be no repetition. \"To those whose lives have been shattered, to the families of those who have died, and to all decent thinking people, of course we all say 'sorry',\" he said.</p> <p>The 937-page report names about 200 people under the privilege accorded the inquiry. Some have previously been identified in court cases, but others have merely been subject of complaints assessed by the team. Still others have been named because they held responsible positions, or because the team felt it necessary to do so to address rumours about them.</p> <p>One person named is Huw Meurig Jones, former deputy head of the Little Acton assessment centre in Wrexham, who gave evidence to the inquiry denying three witnesses' allegations of physical and sexual abuse.</p> <p>Mr Jones resigned in 1981 but is known to have since worked at a private school and sought employment as head of a children's home.

      "bodyText": "A hunt was on last night to find 24 former workers in north Wales children's homes after they were named as proven or suspected abusers, or unsuitable to work with young people, in the long-awaited public inquiry report into the 20-year care scandal in the former counties of Clwyd and Gwynedd. Local and health authorities across Britain are being given 48 hours to check their staff lists and report to the government on whether any of the individuals have jobs where they might have access to children. The move followed publication of the report by a team led by Sir Ronald Waterhouse, a former high court judge, setting out how thousands of youngsters supposedly in the public care were abandoned to regimes of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. Paul Murphy, the Welsh secretary, told parliament that the report catalogued \"deeds of appalling mistreatment and wickedness\". Action was being taken to ensure there could be no repetition. \"To those whose lives have been shattered, to the families of those who have died, and to all decent thinking people, of course we all say 'sorry',\" he said. The 937-page report names about 200 people under the privilege accorded the inquiry. Some have previously been identified in court cases, but others have merely been subject of complaints assessed by the team. Still others have been named because they held responsible positions, or because the team felt it necessary to do so to address rumours about them. One person named is Huw Meurig Jones, former deputy head of the Little Acton assessment centre in Wrexham, who gave evidence to the inquiry denying three witnesses' allegations of physical and sexual abuse. Mr Jones resigned in 1981 but is known to have since worked at a private school and sought employment as head of a children's home. While making clear it could not substantiate the allegations, the team says: \"In our judgment it would be impossible for the public, with knowledge of the facts, to have the degree of confidence in his judgment and probity that is essential for employment in social work involving the care of children.\" The 24 people being urgently traced, including three teachers, are being added to the lists held by the health and education departments of people who have given cause for concern regarding children. There will inevitably be questions about why such action was authorised only yesterday, if the inquiry team has harboured doubts about the individuals for some time. The team completed taking evidence in April 1998. The inquiry, which cost \u00a313.5m, found evidence of widespread sexual abuse of boys in children's homes in Clwyd and some evidence of such abuse of girls. One of the most notorious abusers was Peter Howarth, former deputy head of the Bryn Estyn home, who was jailed for 10 years in 1994 but died in 1997. Although there was no evidence of persistent sexual abuse in children's homes in Gwynedd, there was widespread physical abuse and some evidence of abuse, both physical and sexual, in foster homes. The report finds no case for the rumoured existence of a paedophile ring in high circles, but does confirm that some male abusers in the Chester and Wrexham areas operated as a group, preying on teenage boys in care and the community at large. In a conclusion which will be seized on by opponents of the reduction in the age of consent for gay sex from 18 to 16, the inquiry team draws parliament's attention to the damaging effect of abuse on one teenage boy \"in circumstances which appear to have made him question his own sexuality for a period\". The team's 72 recommendations, applying technically to Wales alone but certain to have a broader impact, include a full review of what it would cost to bring children's services up to an acceptable level of performance. The team also calls for the appointment of a children's commissioner. Although such a move has already been signalled in Wales, the health department proposes to create a children's rights director - a lesser role that has been criticised by children's charities.",

      "bodyText": "Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet is suffering from brain damage, a Spanish newspaper reported today, breaking the conditions of \"strict confidentiality\" under which his medical report was released to four countries. Doctors judged the Pinochet was physically fit enough to stand trial on torture charges, but said the 84-year-old \"would not at the present be mentally capable of meaningful participation in a trial,\" according to a leaked copy of the report published by two Spanish newspapers this morning. The report, handed over to Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland by home secretary Jack Straw yesterday, said that Pinochet's two main medical problems were diabetes and \"recently progressive cerebrovascular brain damage\". It judged that \"further deterioration in both physical and mental condition is likely,\" particularly with any \"situational stress\" brought on by a trial on torture charges. But the four doctors who compiled the report noted that Pinochet has \"shown notable personal abilities in managing stress\" in the past. Given this, they concluded: \"We therefore do not feel able to express any useful opinion on the possible effects on his health of undergoing trial.\" The complete text of the medical report's conclusions was published on Spain's ABC newspaper's website, despite the insistence of Lord Justice Simon Brown in the high court yesterday that \"fairness demanded\" the report should be disclosed only under conditions of \"strict confidentiality\" to Belgium, France and Switzerland. The Home Office announced it would ask Spain to investigate the leaking of the report. \"Because the court stressed that the medical report was only to receive limited dissemination, we have asked the Spanish authorities, through the Crown Prosecution Service, their legal representatives, for any information they can supply about how the conclusions of the report came to be disclosed,\" it said in a statement. Lord Lamont, a prominent pro-Pinochet campaigner, condemned the publication of the confidential medical details: \"What has happened is quite disgusting and entirely predictable from our Spanish friends - it's only happened 24 hours quicker than I expected. \"We are making complete fools of ourselves and we are just being played with by a lot of unscrupulous people,\" Lord Lamont added. Pinochet underwent six hours of medical tests at Northwick Park Hospital on 5 January. The resulting report, which led to Mr Straw saying he was \"minded\" to let Pinochet return to Chile without trial, was signed by Sir John Grimley Evans, professor of clinical geratology at Oxford University, Dr Michael Denham, a consultant physician in geriatric medicine at Northwick Park Hospital, London, and Andrew Lees, professor of neurology at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London. A fourth expert, Dr Maria Wyke, conducted a neuropsychological assessment of Pinochet in Spanish. \"He was a person of superior intelligence and at present is functioning within the low average/average range,\" she said, concluding there was \"no evidence that General Pinochet is attempting to fake disability\". The report revealed that the examining doctors believed there were four mental impediments to Pinochet facing torture charges in court: \u00b7 Memory deficit for both recent and remote events; \u00b7 Limited ability to understand complex sentences and questions owing to memory impairment and consequent inability to process verbal information appropriately; \u00b7 Impaired ability to express himself audibly, succinctly and relevantly; \u00b7 Easy fatiguability. The doctors also offered an insight into the life of the ailing former dictator in the fifteen months he has spent under house arrest in Surrey. \"In recent months he has lost interest in former activities,\" the report said. \"He used to read and use the computer but now tends to sit watching television and says he has forgotten how to use the computer.\" \"Recently he has developed difficulty in shaving without cutting himself,\" it added. Media reports at the weekend suggested that Pinochet's medical condition had since deteriorated further and members of his family were poised to fly to Britain from Chile to visit him on the exclusive Wentworth Estate. Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland now have until 5pm next Tuesday to make representations to the home secretary in the light of the report.",

Mr Morgan, who was elected unopposed, said he felt \"tremendous emotion, honour and privilege\" at having been appointed to a job he had given much thought to over the past two and a half years. In a speech that mixed passion with humour, he said he wanted to inspire voters with a vision of devolution and \"rebuild the bond of trust\" between politicians of all parties and the people of Wales.

Gait was small stepped with instability on turning. The Romberg test was positive. Left-sided upper motor neuron weakness worse in leg than arm was noted as was short-term memory defect. The clinical diagnosis was of multiple small bilateral cerebral infarcts.</p> <p>When reviewed later by Dr Thomas (letter 13.10.99) further deterioration with probable further cerebral ischaemic events on September 20th and October 9th. A definite increase in parkensonian features was noted, with parkensonian speech difficulty, deterioration in handwriting, inability to dress himself, and needing help with rising from chair and with transfers. Since then the senator has had two further falls, one in the garden and one in the bathroom, both due to loss of balance without impairment of consciousness.

      "bodyText": "The Conservative leader William Hague today labelled Tony Blair \"all mouth and no delivery\" for failing to fulfil promises made last year on police numbers, NHS waiting lists and asylum-seekers. To loud cheers from his own benches, Mr Hague challenged the prime minister to read out recent official statistics which contradicted his claims that police numbers had fallen, that waiting lists had lengthened and that assessments of asylum applications had speeded up. Mr Blair dismissed the charges during heated Question Time exchanges in the Commons, and insisted all Labour's pledges would be met, as he has claimed, by the time of the next general election. Mr Blair also insisted waiting lists were lower than the level inherited from the Tories, a record 5,000 extra police were to be recruited and new measures would speed up handling of asylum cases. He claimed that currently 4,000 applications were being processed every month, with 8,000 a month by the late spring. He argued that all these measures would cost money, yet the Tories planned to put their \"tax guarantee\" policy before increases in public spending. Mr Blair said the Tory tax guarantee was a \"boom and bust guarantee\" and an \"NHS cuts guarantee\" as he claimed Labour would put investment in while the Tories would take it out. In earlier more sombre exchanges the prime minister vowed to bring to justice those named as being involved in the Welsh child abuse scandal. After Tuesday's publication of the Waterhouse report, Mr Hague called for resources to be made available to track down 28 people pinpointed as being involved but whose whereabouts was currently unknown. He demanded that such cases be investigated and, where appropriate, prosecutions brought to ensure they never worked with children again. The opposition leader, who commissioned the report when he was Welsh secretary in 1996, added: \"We now know that hundreds of the most vulnerable children in our society were cruelly betrayed. \"The inquiry has come up with many sensible recommendations. Can you give a clear timetable for responding to this report and for action particularly with regard to the creation of a children's commissioner for children in care for all parts of the UK?\" Mr Blair said the Care Standards Bill gave an opportunity for the Government to respond to the report's recommendations. He said the children's rights director would be a senior post within the national care standards commission, which would \"drive forward raising standards of care in these homes\". The prime minister pledged: \"We will implement the measures as soon as we possibly can in respect of all the other recommendations of the report.\" In answer to a challenge from the Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy, Mr Blair stressed that Britain would join the euro \"only in circumstances where it is economically beneficial to the country\". He argued that the decision on when to call a referendum would be based on the economic situation - not anti or pro-European ideology. \"The (economic) tests should surely be British jobs and British investment and British industry - that is a sensible test,\" he said. \"We should not rule out joining the euro for political reasons, which is the position of the Conservative party, but neither should we be in the position where we join regardless of the economic conditions. \"That is surely to the best benefit of the whole of British industry.\" However, Mr Kennedy called on Mr Blair \"to engage more seriously\" in the task of winning public support for euro entry, warning: \"Sentiment is slipping away from the sensible pro-euro case.\" Mr Blair insisted: \"The case of the Government is that we should apply the tests of the economic conditions. \"I believe it is where the vast majority of the British people are, that they want to be in a position where the test is one of Britain's national interest. \"The test is British jobs and British industry and British investment and they believe it is right they should have the ultimate say in a referendum.\"",

Her eyes brighten; she straightens her back. \"I will sell this house today.\" Cut to Carolyn, on her hands and knees cleaning the kitchen. \"I will sell this house today.\" She arranges flowers in the lounge. \"I will sell this house today.\" Carolyn shows a pair of sullen, middle-aged women into the house. \"Welcome! I'm Carolyn Burnham. This living room is very dramatic. But wait until you see the native stone fireplace!\" She hovers in the bedroom. \"Cream would really lighten this place up. You could even put in skylights!\" On to the kitchen. \"A dream come true for any cook!\" Outside, Carolyn stands beside the pool with her disgruntled clients. \"We were told this pool was lagoon-like. There's nothing lagoon-like about it.\" \"Except the bugs.\" \"There aren't even any plants out here.\" Carolyn's smile freezes. She motions toward a bush. \"What do you call this? Is this not a plant? If you have a problem with the plants, I can call my landscape architect.\" \"I think lagoons, I think tropical. This is a... hole.\" Back in the house, alone again, Carolyn weeps. Suddenly she slaps herself around the face. \"Shut up! You're weak! You baby! Shut up! SHUT UP!\" See also: Glengarry Glen Ross, The Two Jakes, Psycho Don't see also: Indecent Proposal Pointless trivia: Annette Bening has described Hilary Clinton's bid to become Senator of New York as the work of \"an opportunist\".",

Macpherson famously concluded \"the [murder] investigation was marred by a combination of professional incompetence, institutional racism and a failure of leadership by senior officers\".

It states: \"Whilst those working within the specialist units are beginning to see positive results, there is more to be done in securing the professional hearts and minds of non-specialist police officers.

No, make that the decade. For once, it seems, the critics got it right. Only the year was 1995, and the film was Toy Story, the magnificent computer-generated account of the travails of the inhabitants of a suburban American toybox. Now it is Groundhog Day for superlatives as reviewers unanimously welcome the arrival of Toy Story 2. Ingenious characterisation . . . superb technical effects . . . dazzling wit . . . the boundary-breaching film for all ages. This time, however, they're wrong. Whisper it soft - unless you want hate mail from under-13s and film critics - but Toy Story 2 is, in fact, not very good. </p> <p>The sequel, which made a record-breaking \u00a37.75m in the UK last weekend and has been deemed one of the 20 all-time highest grossing films in the US, is a pale, pixelated phantom of its glorious predecessor. </p> <p>The visual effects are still remarkable; the startling verisimilitude of the animation, the swooping perspectives, the vivid colours, the pristine planes and rendered textures. But wit, characterisation, dialogue, plot, jokes? No one likes to be identified as a joyless curmudgeon but it has to be said that you'll find more complexity in first generation Space Invaders than you will in this smug sequel. Where the original Toy Story bristled with swift, subversive one-liners, engaging adults and children without patronising either, this pasteurised, homogenised version relies on cheap slapstick and heavy-handed, pointedly-trailed gags: how much more humour can be milked from the near-parodic Star Wars? </p> <p>While the plot of the original movie was seamlessly structured, contrasting the Eden of life with owner Andy to the Inferno of Sid's post-punk nightmare next door, its sequel offers a hectic, one-note sequence of chase and rescue, and the bad guy's lair is simply a drab museum of 50s artefacts. </p> <p>And what has happened to the characters? In the first film, the wonderful Wally Shawn's cowardly dinosaur, Rex, suggested a reptile who had spent several years in inconclusive therapy. Now he's simply a whining kvetch. The original acerbic Mr Potato Head, whose misaligned features prompted references to Picasso portraiture, is now locked in a stereotypical henpecked relationship with an over-solicitous wife. </p> <p>There is one genuinely funny sequence involving a Busby Berkeley routine by grinning Barbie dolls but, overall, the film is a dizzying triumph of form over content. And what of Buzz Lightyear, that relic of the great days of space exploration, when the world was young, the Kennedys were the perfect American family and McDonalds were members of a blameless Scottish clan? </p> <p>In Toy Story, Buzz's epiphany - when he finally realised that he was a child's plaything rather than a pioneering astronaut - was a transcendent moment of tragedy and cathartic humour. In the new movie, he's blandly reconciled to his role as team leader of the chase-and-rescue mission and an allusion to his earlier identity crisis - he encounters a doppelg\u00e4nger, who is still convinced that infinity and beyond are in his grasp - is speedily dealt with as the frantic pursuit resumes. </p> <p>Woody the cowboy - that genial reminder of America's terrestrial pioneering days (James Stewart would have been perfect carbon-based casting) - commands what passes for complexity in this new story when he is stolen by an overweight, halitositic toy collector and meets Jessie, an assertive cowgirl. </p> <p> There is a promising plot strand when it is Woody's turn to face an identity crisis; like Odysseus's lotus eaters or the Snow Queen's Kai, he is tempted to turn his back on his past and exist, unquestioning, in an undemanding present. But it is at this point that every shred of subtlety is drenched in confectioners' sugar as Jessie, hitherto a thigh-slapping proponent of girl power, sings a song of such ghastly lachrymosity that it might well be covered by Sir Cliff on his next album. The song, devoid of a single redeeming note of the irony that enriched Toy Story, is pure Disney. Strip away the computer-generated images and we're back with the soupy, smoochy torch songs which, for children, have marred every cartoon from Bambi to the Lion King. The cowgirl's song - to quote one eminent film critic who was, alas, commenting on another movie - brought out the child in me, and the child in me wanted to throw up. </p> <p>What has gone wrong? Conspiracy theorists might find clues in the title sequences of the film - Pixar, the company responsible for the creative genius behind Toy Story, offers a witty animated sequence referring to its own humble grassroots. Disney, the global merchandiser of sentimentality, claims credit with its portentous logo. Was innovative Pixar crushed in Disney's sugar mill? </p> <p>But the clever creators of Toy Story have to take some blame for this sad falling-off. The self-congratulatory \"out-takes\" of fluffed lines and corpsing \"actors\" in the closing credits suggest that, fatally, they had begun to believe their own publicity. This problem has faced many charged with the task of making sequels to unexpected, runaway - and deserved - successes. Those involved can be too close to the project, accentuate the wrong aspects and overlook the real charm of the original. </p> <p>Perhaps a second sequel, Toy Story 3, will eschew the saccharine and bring back the subversion. Meanwhile, children will, of course, love Toy Story 2, the box office will boom and the entire thesaurus of superlatives will continue to be deployed. The picture is certainly worth seeing, but joyless curmudgeons are urged to wear earplugs. Or rent a video of the peerless Toy Story instead.</p>",

Darren Maddy is compact and eager, but once opposing captains plug his favourite shovel through square-leg, he'll be even more out of his depth than he already is. Vikram Solanki is capable of treading water at least, but he was all at sea today, and could have been dismissed three times before he was bowled going for a lazy cut shot. (His brief international cv now reads 7, 14, 16*, 10 and 11.) Craig White may have fallen to a brilliant catch by Henry Olonga, but a) he shouldn't have made a meal of a slow full-toss, and b) he shouldn't be batting as high as No.6 anyway.</p> <p>There were two other areas of concern. England shouldn't have allowed Grant Flower to be so dominant at the end of the Zimbabwean innings on a sluggish pitch. And they certainly shouldn't have allowed him to get away with figures of 10-1-27-3, when his previous 118 matches had brought him 44 wickets.</p> <p>But these are minor carps. England did it in style in the end, and there were even signs that they're beginning to think a bit more as well. With the weather a constant threat, the pressure was atmospheric too, and Hick assiduously kept one eye on a Duckworth/Lewis chart he had in his pocket. Three years ago, England probably wouldn't have managed that either. </p> <p><em>Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com</em></p>",

Darren Maddy is compact and eager, but once opposing captains plug his favourite shovel through square-leg, he'll be even more out of his depth than he already is. Vikram Solanki is capable of treading water at least, but he was all at sea today, and could have been dismissed three times before he was bowled going for a lazy cut shot. (His brief international cv now reads 7, 14, 16*, 10 and 11.) Craig White may have fallen to a brilliant catch by Henry Olonga, but a) he shouldn't have made a meal of a slow full-toss, and b) he shouldn't be batting as high as No.6 anyway. There were two other areas of concern. England shouldn't have allowed Grant Flower to be so dominant at the end of the Zimbabwean innings on a sluggish pitch. And they certainly shouldn't have allowed him to get away with figures of 10-1-27-3, when his previous 118 matches had brought him 44 wickets. But these are minor carps. England did it in style in the end, and there were even signs that they're beginning to think a bit more as well. With the weather a constant threat, the pressure was atmospheric too, and Hick assiduously kept one eye on a Duckworth/Lewis chart he had in his pocket. Three years ago, England probably wouldn't have managed that either. Lawrence Booth is assistant editor of wisden.com",

The boy takes out some felt pens and draws a picture of me. We are in an upstairs room at the Accord contact centre in north-west London, talking, but mostly waiting. In half an hour's time, the children will say goodbye to Nina, descend to the ground floor and go into another room full of toys. There they will meet their father. These days, they never meet him in any other place. But if they didn't meet him there, they might not even know him. </p> <p>Nina's children's father is an alcoholic. His drinking fuelled the violence that led to his divorce from Nina, and the courts have ruled that his continuing dependence makes it unsafe for him to exercise his right to contact - what used to be called \"access\" - with his son and daughter anywhere except under the auspices of the Accord. One of 277 contact centres in the country, the Accord is the biggest. It was set up in 1997 by Welcare Community Projects, and provides specialised services that are beyond the scope of most others. Its core purpose, though, is the same as more modest centres, which may comprise only a handful of volunteers and a church hall: to provide an impartial location where younger children - most are under 10 - may keep alive relationships with estranged parents that otherwise would lapse or even die. </p> <p>Contact centres contend with some of the rawest emotions and deepest fears that arise from family breakdown. Many of the parents who use their services are unlikely ever to make the kinds of voluntary agreements that might otherwise be achieved with the help of mediators. Most are in the thick of post-separation acrimony and although some troubled families approach centres for help of their own volition - and are welcome to do so - the great majority are referred by the courts or social workers while legal settlements are argued over, sometimes for years. There is often such ill-feeling between the parents that a contact centre is the only place where they can transfer their children to each other's care without quarrelling or worse. </p> <p>The building has good security arrangements and enough rooms to keep feuding parents separate. It helps that there is no car park - \"That's where all the fights start,\" remarks one of the Accord's staff, who has seen it happen elsewhere. </p> <p>Movement within the Accord building is managed with great care. When the parent with whom the child still lives - the \"carer parent\" - arrives at the centre they go to their own special room where they and their children await the arrival of the \"contact parent\" in the contact room (aka the \"bumblebee room\"). Nina and her children are well used to the procedure - they are Accord veterans - but for others, especially those new to it, making the move into the bumblebee room can be fraught. Children may be anxious about meeting contact parents, perhaps because they haven't seen them for some time, perhaps because of past bad experiences, perhaps because their other parent has been turning them against the contact parent. Coaxing a reluctant child can be one of the hardest parts of the job for the Accord's staff, especially if the carer parent deepens that reluctance. </p> <p>Julia Wise-St Leger, Welcare's chief executive of the Accord centre, has no doubt where responsibility lies in such situations: \"We will say to the carer parent that it is their responsibility to help the child feel happy to meet their other parent, even if it sometimes means going with them at first.\" </p> <p>Mixed feelings, inevitably, are common on all sides. In the bumblebee room, a young man plays mini-snooker with his small son; they are each clearly delighted by the other. Nina's children are happy, too. Dad used to turn up too drunk to stay awake, but not any more. Sober, he seems fragile and almost childlike himself. The three of them look totally at ease. Another father, though, is deeply unhappy. Sunil and his wife are going through a painful divorce and, at least for now, his time with his son, aged just 14 months, is restricted by court order to a short period at a contact centre every Saturday. On this occasion, though, Sunil's wife had failed to turn up with the child: further proof, he believes, that she is intent on stopping him from building a proper relationship with the child. </p> <p>In such situations a contact centre can only try to persuade defaulters to behave otherwise. Similarly, it cannot always still the fears of those who honour court orders that they are unhappy about. Another user of the centre, Mary, is happy enough for her older son to see his father at the Accord: \"I feel the boy needs contact with his father, but I wouldn't want him having it anywhere else. I feel this is a good place, a safe place. He's not capable of looking after the boy anywhere else.\" However, she would rather keep her younger son away from his father, at least for now. \"He never wanted the second boy, and has never shown the slightest concern for him. The child has become asthmatic since he started coming here to see him; I'm sure it's because of anxiety.\" As for the father, he resents having to use the contact centre at all. </p> <p>Dealing with parental resistance is part of the centre's work. Just as some carer parents don't want their children to see the estranged parent anywhere, ever, many contact parents feel stigmatised by being reduced to seeing their children in an artificial setting, however child-friendly. The Accord's approach is to stress that children's needs must come first, and that the centre aims to help everyone move forward. That entails providing more than just a physical space. All Accord clients have to make a \"pre-visit\" so that Wise-St Leger can make her own assessment of each situation and prepare suitably. Contact parents with agreements or court permission may take children off the premises during their contact period, sometimes just to a nearby McDonald's, sometimes further afield. Others have to be kept safely indoors. </p> <p>Providing \"supported contact\" can be a delicate business, requiring staff, some of whom are trained volunteers, to facilitate play and interaction between parents and children, but also to be watchful. As one volunteer acknowledges: \"You have to make sure nothing is going on, such as the wrong sort of touching. That happens very rarely, but I have sometimes been asked to keep an eye. It's an uncomfortable position to be in.\" Serious accusations can be made. One former Accord client, Harry, had precisely that experience. His former wife alleged that \"interference\" was taking place in the main contact room. Though sickened by the accusation, Harry went along with the Accord's suggestion that his contact sessions be supervised in a separate room. This meant the entire session being observed and a report compiled. There was no evidence of abuse, and the Accord's report was used to vindicate Harry in court. He now sees his children on a freer basis, but still comes back to the Accord to work as a volunteer. </p> <p>The need for more people like Harry is increasing as the demand for contact centres rises. The National Association of Child Contact Centres is aiming to increase the number of centres to 400, and its chief executive, Eunice Halliday, has recently urged the government to release more resources so that this target can be met. It is not hard to sympathise with the cause. At present, some 19,000 children use one to keep in touch with estranged parents at an intensely difficult times in their young lives. Many more would surely cherish the chance to wear smiles as wide as Nina's children's as they play in the safety of the contact centre, laughing with their dad.</p>",

A team of Italian scientists has found that exposure to some nasty bugs might actually help to prevent children from developing allergies. </p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>These days I seem to spend much of my time chasing my one-year-old through the house, extracting filthy objects from her jaws and yanking her hands from grimy crevices. I do my best to keep her clean, but as I scrape partially digested foodstuffs from floors, carpets and walls, I get the sense that she's only a mouthful away from botulism. Last week's issue of the British Medical Journal, though, seems to contain good news for people like me whose cleaning skills aren't all they should be. A team of Italian scientists has found that exposure to some nasty bugs might actually help to prevent children from developing allergies. </p> <p>Given that one in three children in Britain today suffers from allergies and that each year asthma kills 2,000 people and soaks up \u00a32bn of our taxes, any scientific breakthrough has got to be good news. The Italian team, led by Dr Paolo Matricardi, studied airforce cadets aged 17-24 years and found that those who had been exposed to microbes transmitted orally - in contaminated food for instance - were less likely to suffer from respiratory allergies than those who had been unaffected. </p> <p>The theory is simple: if your child's immune system is stimulated, it will get used to coping with foreign invaders. Too much bug-free food and bleaching of surfaces and it will stay weak and vulnerable, and your child will therefore be more likely to develop allergies. It creates a bit of a dilemma, doesn't it? Nobody wants their child to be infected with salmonella, but asthma's no picnic either. Matricardi's advice is double-edged: \"We must improve hygiene to reduce the impact of infectious diseases,\" he says. \"But at the same time, we must learn how to safely 'train' our immune system, especially during infancy, in order to prevent allergy.\" </p> <p>Dr Matricardi was studying Heliobacter pylori and the hepatitis A virus - not bugs any sane parent would want anywhere near their child. But the team found that it's not the bugs themselves that prevent allergies. It's just that when they cause infection they stimulate the immune response, and therefore help to protect the body from other invaders. The National Asthma Campaign is optimistic. \"We hope that the data from this study can be used to develop vaccines against asthma,\" said a spokesperson. </p> <p>Martyn Partridge, a consultant chest physician at Whipps Cross Hospital in London, also welcomes the research. \"It's a vital step forward in our understanding of allergies,\" he said. \"Children today are exposed to far fewer nasty bugs than they would once have been. This research shows that things children used to be routinely exposed to, such as food poisoning or contaminated drinking water, were probably also priming their immune systems.\" </p> <p>Of course, the idea that dirt might not be all bad isn't new. A study last year claimed that regular contact with farm animals makes children less likely to develop allergies. And 10 years ago Professor David Strachan of St George's hospital medical school in London advanced his \"dirt hypothesis\" after observing that children from large families who are exposed to infections at a young age are less likely to develop allergies than are children from smaller families, raised in a \"cleaner\" environment. </p> <p>But what does this new research really mean for parents today? Can we whip off our Marigolds and let our little ones wallow in muck? Absolutely not, say the experts. \"Matricardi's study isn't yet of any practical benefit to the way you bring up your children,\" says Partridge. For a start, susceptibility to allergies can be genetic. Also, many allergies are probably caused by our living conditions generally, not just our relative cleanliness: carpets, double-glazing, draught-proofing and showers all make our homes warm, damp and insulated - the perfect environment for house mites and other allergens. The National Asthma Campaign is also adamant that while Matricardi's study bolsters the \"dirt hypothesis\", backwards is not the way forwards. \"We certainly would not encourage you to let your children eat dirt.\" </p> <p>So you can't just turn your house into some kind of Angela's Ashes slum, and hope your child survives to be wheeze-free. A bit of dirt might not do much harm, but virulent filth will. Still, one day I could find myself taking a break from the hoovering to get my child vaccinated with dirt. Some things in life just don't seem fair, do they?</p>",

      "bodyText": "These days I seem to spend much of my time chasing my one-year-old through the house, extracting filthy objects from her jaws and yanking her hands from grimy crevices. I do my best to keep her clean, but as I scrape partially digested foodstuffs from floors, carpets and walls, I get the sense that she's only a mouthful away from botulism. Last week's issue of the British Medical Journal, though, seems to contain good news for people like me whose cleaning skills aren't all they should be. A team of Italian scientists has found that exposure to some nasty bugs might actually help to prevent children from developing allergies. Given that one in three children in Britain today suffers from allergies and that each year asthma kills 2,000 people and soaks up \u00a32bn of our taxes, any scientific breakthrough has got to be good news. The Italian team, led by Dr Paolo Matricardi, studied airforce cadets aged 17-24 years and found that those who had been exposed to microbes transmitted orally - in contaminated food for instance - were less likely to suffer from respiratory allergies than those who had been unaffected. The theory is simple: if your child's immune system is stimulated, it will get used to coping with foreign invaders. Too much bug-free food and bleaching of surfaces and it will stay weak and vulnerable, and your child will therefore be more likely to develop allergies. It creates a bit of a dilemma, doesn't it? Nobody wants their child to be infected with salmonella, but asthma's no picnic either. Matricardi's advice is double-edged: \"We must improve hygiene to reduce the impact of infectious diseases,\" he says. \"But at the same time, we must learn how to safely 'train' our immune system, especially during infancy, in order to prevent allergy.\" Dr Matricardi was studying Heliobacter pylori and the hepatitis A virus - not bugs any sane parent would want anywhere near their child. But the team found that it's not the bugs themselves that prevent allergies. It's just that when they cause infection they stimulate the immune response, and therefore help to protect the body from other invaders. The National Asthma Campaign is optimistic. \"We hope that the data from this study can be used to develop vaccines against asthma,\" said a spokesperson. Martyn Partridge, a consultant chest physician at Whipps Cross Hospital in London, also welcomes the research. \"It's a vital step forward in our understanding of allergies,\" he said. \"Children today are exposed to far fewer nasty bugs than they would once have been. This research shows that things children used to be routinely exposed to, such as food poisoning or contaminated drinking water, were probably also priming their immune systems.\" Of course, the idea that dirt might not be all bad isn't new. A study last year claimed that regular contact with farm animals makes children less likely to develop allergies. And 10 years ago Professor David Strachan of St George's hospital medical school in London advanced his \"dirt hypothesis\" after observing that children from large families who are exposed to infections at a young age are less likely to develop allergies than are children from smaller families, raised in a \"cleaner\" environment. But what does this new research really mean for parents today? Can we whip off our Marigolds and let our little ones wallow in muck? Absolutely not, say the experts. \"Matricardi's study isn't yet of any practical benefit to the way you bring up your children,\" says Partridge. For a start, susceptibility to allergies can be genetic. Also, many allergies are probably caused by our living conditions generally, not just our relative cleanliness: carpets, double-glazing, draught-proofing and showers all make our homes warm, damp and insulated - the perfect environment for house mites and other allergens. The National Asthma Campaign is also adamant that while Matricardi's study bolsters the \"dirt hypothesis\", backwards is not the way forwards. \"We certainly would not encourage you to let your children eat dirt.\" So you can't just turn your house into some kind of Angela's Ashes slum, and hope your child survives to be wheeze-free. A bit of dirt might not do much harm, but virulent filth will. Still, one day I could find myself taking a break from the hoovering to get my child vaccinated with dirt. Some things in life just don't seem fair, do they?",

      "body": "<p>The official term is bill shock - that numbing feeling when you open a telephone bill after spending a little too long surfing on the internet.</p> <p>The cost of access to the web has long been identified as arguably the chief barrier to the growth of the internet in Britain and chancellor Gordon Brown will tonight set new targets to halve the amount consumers and businesses are paying by 2002.</p> <p>The chancellor wants access charges to match those in the US and will suggest that regulatory action will be taken if telecoms companies and internet service providers fail to move prices downwards themselves. </p> <p>At the end of last year some 18% of people in this country were accessing the internet, ahead of most of Europe but trailing the gadget-loving Scandanavians - led by Sweden where the figure is 41%, and the US at 46%.</p> <p>Costs of internet access in Britain have fallen dramatically in the past year through the introduction of \"free\" service providers which began with Freeserve, launched by high street electrical retailer Dixons. Freeserve quickly became the biggest service provider in Britain by dropping the conventional monthly subscription fee, in most cases around \u00a312-15, and prompted a wave of copycat services. </p> <p>Even though \"free\" access is something of a misnomer - due to the continued existence of call charges - the new model for internet access underlined a near doubling of people going online across Europe last year. ISP's which offer free access make their money back on a share of call charges and theoretically e-commerce and advertising. </p> <p>But even with free access, the cost of peak-rate charges in Britain remains roughly 20% higher than Italy, 50% higher than the US and 100% higher than Canada, according to government statistics.</p> <p>A number of key developments are on the way, however, that should enable Mr Brown to achieve his aims without intervention.</p> <p>The high level of internet use in the US has largely been driven by the country's longstanding method of not charging for local calls. This \"unmetered\" access has meant that people are not discouraged from surfing by the fear of high telephone bills.</p> <p>A number of companies in Britain have started to experiment with versions of unmetered charging including cable company Telewest which launched a new tariff earlier this week charging a flat monthly fee of \u00a310 for unlimited web access.</p> <p>The major change, however, will come in the spring when British Telecom launches its own unmetered internet access product called Surftime. Not only will BT be offering the service but, because of the way the company is regulated, other internet service providers will also be able to repackage the service and sell it under their own brands. This means unmetered calling is likely to become pervasive. The other significant change approaching is the so called \"unbundling of the local loop\".

      "bodyText": "The official term is bill shock - that numbing feeling when you open a telephone bill after spending a little too long surfing on the internet. The cost of access to the web has long been identified as arguably the chief barrier to the growth of the internet in Britain and chancellor Gordon Brown will tonight set new targets to halve the amount consumers and businesses are paying by 2002. The chancellor wants access charges to match those in the US and will suggest that regulatory action will be taken if telecoms companies and internet service providers fail to move prices downwards themselves. At the end of last year some 18% of people in this country were accessing the internet, ahead of most of Europe but trailing the gadget-loving Scandanavians - led by Sweden where the figure is 41%, and the US at 46%. Costs of internet access in Britain have fallen dramatically in the past year through the introduction of \"free\" service providers which began with Freeserve, launched by high street electrical retailer Dixons. Freeserve quickly became the biggest service provider in Britain by dropping the conventional monthly subscription fee, in most cases around \u00a312-15, and prompted a wave of copycat services. Even though \"free\" access is something of a misnomer - due to the continued existence of call charges - the new model for internet access underlined a near doubling of people going online across Europe last year. ISP's which offer free access make their money back on a share of call charges and theoretically e-commerce and advertising. But even with free access, the cost of peak-rate charges in Britain remains roughly 20% higher than Italy, 50% higher than the US and 100% higher than Canada, according to government statistics. A number of key developments are on the way, however, that should enable Mr Brown to achieve his aims without intervention. The high level of internet use in the US has largely been driven by the country's longstanding method of not charging for local calls. This \"unmetered\" access has meant that people are not discouraged from surfing by the fear of high telephone bills. A number of companies in Britain have started to experiment with versions of unmetered charging including cable company Telewest which launched a new tariff earlier this week charging a flat monthly fee of \u00a310 for unlimited web access. The major change, however, will come in the spring when British Telecom launches its own unmetered internet access product called Surftime. Not only will BT be offering the service but, because of the way the company is regulated, other internet service providers will also be able to repackage the service and sell it under their own brands. This means unmetered calling is likely to become pervasive. The other significant change approaching is the so called \"unbundling of the local loop\". Eight months ago, BT was warned that it will be forced to give up its stranglehold on the local network of telephone wires in July 2001 allowing rival suppliers to take over the line to the home at the customer's request. The effective dismantling of BT is seen as key because despite almost a decade of competition in Britain's telecoms market, around 85% of homes are still connected to the erstwhile monopoly. Opening up BT's local loop to competition will have two effects. Most simply, the increased competition will put pressure on service providers and telecoms companies to reduce their prices still further. But by giving other companies access to BT's network, the government and Oftel, also hope to speed the investment needed to upgrade the wires. The \"killer\" technology which will do that is called ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) which enables existing copper wires to be used for high bandwidth applications such as high speed internet and broadcasting. The company which runs the line installs its kit at the telephone exchange and a box over the wall socket in the home which means there is no need to dig up the road and put down new cable. Oftel and Mr Brown are minded to encourage BT to get its network ready earlier than the July 2001 date although given BT's natural reluctance that seems unlikely.",

      "body": "<p>Three months after a cyclone killed 20,000 in the Indian state of Orissa, across the Bay | of Bengal, people in the vulnerable coastal areas of Bangladesh are bracing themselves for the new cyclone season. Sadly, many will die needlessly simply because there are not enough shelters for the 7m people at risk. </p> <p>Golam Rabbani, regional chief of the Red Crescent Cyclone Preparedness Programme (CPP), says the tragedy will happen even though Bangladesh has the most advanced cyclone tracking system in the world and plenty of warning will be given - through a 10-hour \"great danger\" signal on the radio and by teams with megaphones. \"When the warning comes, it is first-come-first-served at the shelters,\" he says. \"Those who cannot get in have nowhere to go and many could drown as a result.\" </p> <p>Rabbani says there are 1,841 cyclone shelters in the coastal belt of Bangladesh, capable of taking 1.3 million people. At least another 3,500 shelters are needed. </p> <p>The Red Crescent is appealing to the prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, for more funds when she visits the seaside resort of Cox's Bazaar on March 2 to talk to 2,500 CPP volunteers and meet team leaders from the region. Currently, government funding for the CPP early warning programme is the equivalent of only about one penny per head per year for those at risk. Funds are so short that there is not enough money to provide torches for all the 32,904 volunteers and half of each team of 12 are not issued with raincoats and boots. Each group is allowed one megaphone for warning purposes. </p> <p>After the terrible disaster in Chittagong in 1991, when officially 138,000 people died out of an affected population of 3 million, funds were given by foreign governments and aid agencies, but it was still not enough. Some shelters were built in places where they were not needed, while vulnerable offshore islands where many were killed were given little or no protection. </p> <p>Ten miles south of Chittagong is Patenga, which was flattened by a tidal surge in 1991. A new 30-foot-high \"bund\" - a bank topped with a road - has been built to replace the one destroyed in the last cyclone, but land donated by the villagers to build a promised cyclone shelter is still just a grassy patch. The bund would not be enough to protect the coast if the cyclone coincided with a high tide, as it did in 1991. </p> <p>Ismail Hossain, aged 45, a survivor of that disaster, says: \"Local political leaders, at the time of the elections, utter sweet words and give false hope of constructing shelters, roads and bringing electricity, but after the elections they do not turn up, nor do their promised improvements.\" </p> <p>Rezia Begum, the oldest member of the community, lost seven members of her family in 1991, including six grandchildren. Some were never found. She recalls: \"The water gushed over the embankment, sweeping away houses. It was over the roof tops. The surge carried me and I was trapped in a tree.\" Other survivors brought her down from the tree two days later, when the water receded. </p> <p>Those who survived did so by luck. Hazrat Ali jumped on the back of his cow, knowing it could swim, and clung on for an hour until it reached dry land. Afterwards, hunger forced him to sell her. \"I sold her to a butcher to fill my belly,\" he says. \"Now I think I am the most ungrateful man in the world.\" </p> <p>Near the centre of Chittagong is a shelter built with Saudi government money. It is at the base of one of Chittagong's hills, where people could scramble to safety without the need of a shelter. However, Bimal Kanti Barua is grateful. He is headmaster of the primary school which uses the shelter for its classrooms. It also doubles as a local meeting hall. </p> <p>Rabbani says: \"This shelter probably would not have been built there now. We have different rules.\" He says it would still be used to shield people against the winds, but it would not now be a priority. </p> <p>He also says that, despite the previous devastation at Patenga beach, he does not think building the bund and a shelter was a priority either, because there are roads and, with the early warning system, people could be bussed to safety. He is more concerned about low lying islands from which there is no escape. They are the most vulnerable to the next cyclone. </p> <p>One such island, Urirchar on the Meghna river, is a newly-emerged 8 sq km island formed from the washed down silt of the annual floods. In 1985, it was hit by a cyclone and half the 10,000 people on the island died. Nural Islam, aged 70, had moved to the island because his home on another silt island had been washed away in erosion. He lost his wife, three daughters and a son in the 1985 tidal surge. </p> <p>Two shelters were built subsequently and have room for 2,000 people standing up. But there are 10,000 people living on the island, with the nearest safety two days' journey away in small boats. </p> <p>One of the newer islands is Sonar Char - or \"golden island\", because of the quality of rice it produces. It has 1,500 people living on it, and Abbas Ali was the only survivor of the 1991 cyclone. \"I could not know what happened,\" he says. \"I just found myself floating in the darkness.\" He was rescued after swimming for two days. </p> <p>Now, during the cyclone season, everyone under 18 and over 40 is evacuated from the island to distant safe places. </p> <p>Rabbani says there are some places which are so dangerous that he believes people should be banned from living there are all. He supports a new \"disaster act\" proposed by the government to declare some places off limits. </p> <p>In the past 200 years, 64 major cyclones have struck the coast of Bangladesh and it is inevitable that there will be more. </p> <p>Samarendra Karmaker, regional director of the meteorological department at Chittagong, says that cyclones - which strike between April and May and from autumn up to November - can be 1,000km (600 miles) across and have winds up to 360kph (220mph). </p> <p>He believes that the early warning system is probably the best in the world, with the most sophisticated methods of tracking exactly where the storms will make landfall. But he adds: \"The most serious problem we have remaining is to educate people to leave their homes and save their lives.\" </p> <p>Poorer people, with no way of locking their homes, fear they will be looted, so they are prepared to risk their lives rather than travel to seek safety. There are often no shelters or substantial buildings nearby and those left behind on watch are killed. </p> <p> In an effort to improve the response of poorer people, the CPP has trained 2,070 imams, the local religious leaders. They will use their microphone systems - normally used for calling the faithful to prayer - to warn local people of impending danger. It is hoped their influence will get people to seek safety. </p> <p>In the 1991 cyclone, Chittagong port was devastated: 28,000 bodies were found in the area, 35 ships were sunk or badly damaged and thousands of containers were blown away. But now the port is well prepared, with special control rooms and emergency plans which are put into action during cyclone alerts. Larger ships are sent out to weather the storm in deep water, while smaller boats are sent up river for safety. Those that cannot be moved because of tide or breakdown are secured with double cyclone lines. </p> <p>Concrete buildings, strong enough to withstand the wind and high enough to be safe from a tidal surge, can shelter more than 10,000 workers. The port, at least, is ready for the next onslaught. </p> <p>\u0095 Paul Brown, the Guardian's environment correspondent, was director of a recent training course in Chittagong for the Commonwealth Journalists' Association.</p>",

We have different rules.\" He says it would still be used to shield people against the winds, but it would not now be a priority. He also says that, despite the previous devastation at Patenga beach, he does not think building the bund and a shelter was a priority either, because there are roads and, with the early warning system, people could be bussed to safety. He is more concerned about low lying islands from which there is no escape. They are the most vulnerable to the next cyclone. One such island, Urirchar on the Meghna river, is a newly-emerged 8 sq km island formed from the washed down silt of the annual floods. In 1985, it was hit by a cyclone and half the 10,000 people on the island died. Nural Islam, aged 70, had moved to the island because his home on another silt island had been washed away in erosion. He lost his wife, three daughters and a son in the 1985 tidal surge. Two shelters were built subsequently and have room for 2,000 people standing up. But there are 10,000 people living on the island, with the nearest safety two days' journey away in small boats. One of the newer islands is Sonar Char - or \"golden island\", because of the quality of rice it produces. It has 1,500 people living on it, and Abbas Ali was the only survivor of the 1991 cyclone. \"I could not know what happened,\" he says. \"I just found myself floating in the darkness.\" He was rescued after swimming for two days. Now, during the cyclone season, everyone under 18 and over 40 is evacuated from the island to distant safe places. Rabbani says there are some places which are so dangerous that he believes people should be banned from living there are all. He supports a new \"disaster act\" proposed by the government to declare some places off limits. In the past 200 years, 64 major cyclones have struck the coast of Bangladesh and it is inevitable that there will be more. Samarendra Karmaker, regional director of the meteorological department at Chittagong, says that cyclones - which strike between April and May and from autumn up to November - can be 1,000km (600 miles) across and have winds up to 360kph (220mph). He believes that the early warning system is probably the best in the world, with the most sophisticated methods of tracking exactly where the storms will make landfall. But he adds: \"The most serious problem we have remaining is to educate people to leave their homes and save their lives.\" Poorer people, with no way of locking their homes, fear they will be looted, so they are prepared to risk their lives rather than travel to seek safety. There are often no shelters or substantial buildings nearby and those left behind on watch are killed. In an effort to improve the response of poorer people, the CPP has trained 2,070 imams, the local religious leaders. They will use their microphone systems - normally used for calling the faithful to prayer - to warn local people of impending danger. It is hoped their influence will get people to seek safety. In the 1991 cyclone, Chittagong port was devastated: 28,000 bodies were found in the area, 35 ships were sunk or badly damaged and thousands of containers were blown away. But now the port is well prepared, with special control rooms and emergency plans which are put into action during cyclone alerts. Larger ships are sent out to weather the storm in deep water, while smaller boats are sent up river for safety. Those that cannot be moved because of tide or breakdown are secured with double cyclone lines. Concrete buildings, strong enough to withstand the wind and high enough to be safe from a tidal surge, can shelter more than 10,000 workers. The port, at least, is ready for the next onslaught. \u0095 Paul Brown, the Guardian's environment correspondent, was director of a recent training course in Chittagong for the Commonwealth Journalists' Association.",

But there is only one snag: because your parents failed to care for you as a child, you've grown up in foster families. And, at 16, the system is ready to pull the rug out from under your feet. The local authority's duties as a corporate parent come to an end. Homeless, unsupported, struggling to get benefits, the nearest you may come to a fulfilling future is being one more statistic in someone's thesis on unemployment. </p> <p>The current care system is flawed and everybody knows it. The government has recognised this and in 1998 announced the Quality Protects programme - a \u00a3375m initiative to transform the quality of care. </p> <p>It has also introduced the children (leaving care) bill, which is entering its committee stage in the House of Lords. This acknowledges that the current trend for young people to be discharged from local authority care at 16 is an inadequate response to the needs of this very vulnerable group. The bill will impose new and stronger duties upon local authorities to support care leavers until they are at least 18. </p> <p>But is 18 old enough to allow young people to benefit from the educational and training opportunities that many of them need to survive alone in society? </p> <p>The Action on Aftercare Consortium, a group of children's charities working with care leavers, feels that the government is missing a valuable opportunity to extend the duties of local authorities to assist these young people until they are 21 - or 24 if they are still in education or training, recognising that previously disadvantaged young people may need longer to catch up. </p> <p>\"The government is talking about giving local authorities the power to assist with education, training and employment up to 24, but a power is very different from a duty,\" says Amanda Allard, chair of the consortium and public policy officer with NCH Action For Children. </p> <p>\"I know from talking to our after-care projects that local authorities don't exercise their existing discretionary powers with regard to care leavers. If there's a hard-pressed choice between things the local authority has to do and things they would chose to do if funds were only available, the outcome is pretty obvious. I believe the government when they say they'd like to make it a duty but that they're not sure if the money is there. But if they make it a duty then the treasury will have to find the money.\" </p> <p>Allard says that promoting the education of young people in care fits well with the Quality Protects objectives for enabling young care leavers to live successful adult lives. However, she argues that what is needed is a system which supports young people rather than forcing them to fight for the help they need. Parents, she says, support their children through the ups and downs of teenage years, providing the safety net when the going gets tough. Young people who have already suffered the disadvantage of being in the care system have a right to expect the same - if not more. </p> <p>\"I came across a young care leaver who was on a training course where it was mandatory to have a particular type of boots with steel caps,\" Allard says. \"He just couldn't afford these himself and the after-care project had to threaten the local authority with going to the media in order to get him these boots. There will be other tools he needs for further parts of the course, but the local authority have said that they won't help him any more.\" </p> <p>The Action on Aftercare Consortium has supporters in high places. Sir William Utting, former chief inspector of social services and author of the Safeguards for Children Living Away from Home report in 1997, pays tribute to the government's integrated strategy for improving care, but wants to see it strike while the iron is hot. </p> <p>\"I think the government accepts the case for extending a local authority's duties until young people from care are 21 or 24, but says it's still a question of timing,\" Utting says. \"To me, this is the best and only time in which this can be achieved. At the moment, it would be in the context of the bill going through parliament. This group of young people is currently receiving sustained interests and support from politicians, the media and the public. </p> <p>\"My worry is that if extending the age limit is differed, this small and isolated group of young people may revert to their former low priority. The single measure of extending the local authority duty to 21 may soon be overtaken by other agendas.\" </p> <p>Billie Ibbidun, national coordinator for A National Voice, an organisation run by and for young people from the care system, says that young people from care are always making the distinction between what \"real\" parents give their children and what young people are offered by social services. She says that most young people do not feel cared for, and that feeling loved and cared for is the thing which enables most of us to flourish. </p> <p>\"The care system should help young people to be the best they can,\" Ibbidun says. \"For some, the best will be to find fulfilling work. For others, it will be to go on to higher education. It's different for everyone. But at the moment there's very limited opportunity.\" </p> <p>Ibbidun gives the example of Allison (not her real name), who was recently offered a place at university. However, because she had moved between authorities, neither was prepared to support her financially. She had to leave supported housing when she reached 18. She was forced to approach a charity to obtain accommodation. </p> <p>Her problems were compounded because, having no contact with her parents, she could not provide information about their income, on which her eligibility for a student loan could be assessed. She only managed to complete her first term because another charity made her a cash grant. Her second term has just started, but she has no idea how much longer she will be able to continue. </p> <p>\"Allison just wants to be like her contemporaries - embracing mainstream life,\" Ibbidun says. \"But she's being forced to seek grants from charities and queue up with homeless people. She's being shoved into a category of 'excluded' people. She's a sparkling young woman who deserves the right to make her own future.\" </p> <p>\"We must redesign the care system so that it doesn't create a heap of wasted talent,\" says Susanna Cheal, chief executive of the Who Cares? Trust. \"Surely all young people are entitled to have aspirations, but the current system is putting roadblocks in the way of those who have already encountered more problems than most of us can imagine. We welcome the government's intention to raise the duty of care to 18 - but we want them to go that further step and ensure that local authorities support young people through those vital times in their lives when new opportunities are opening up for them. Only that way can they look back and say: 'The system helped me to feel cared for and cared about. Now I have left care behind - but only when I was ready.'\" </p> <p><strong> Wanted: time to grow up</strong> </p> <p>Melanie is 18, wants to work with children, and is currently taking a three-year course in health and social care. She loves the work, her tutors are delighted with her progress, but Melanie may be forced to leave college - because she has grown up in foster care. </p> <p>\"Melanie was a very timid girl who was picked on at school,\" explains Avril McGowan, her former foster carer. \"Going on to the FE course was the turning point in her life. </p> <p>\"But she'd just started her second year at college when I had a phone call saying that because she'd reached her 18th birthday she'd have to leave. </p> <p>\"They were talking about moving her to a hostel but I knew she'd be eaten alive there. I found her a flat with a friend, paid the deposit myself and kitted it out. But she doesn't understand the bills, and there have been problems with her benefits. Melanie is a young woman who really needed a little more time for growing up.\" </p> <p>When Melanie reaches 19 she must be available for employment in order to receive benefits - which means she may have to give up her college place. </p> <p>\"This course is Melanie's real chance to do something she'll be good at,\" Avril says. \"Instead, she could end up on the dole. </p> <p>\"Children shouldn't be prevented from going into further education because they've been in care.

The review concluded, debatably, that such incentives would add too much complexity. But the government has recognised that US universities raise a lot of money through such trusts, and has therefore proposed removing one major tax barrier to giving in this way. In future, trusts in which the settlor has an interest will be able to make donations to charity without attracting a tax charge for the settlor. The government undoubtedly realises that any changes must be kept simple if it is really to stimulate increased giving. Charities need to work closely with the inland revenue over the coming months as officials work out the details, to ensure that the new measures are not strangled at birth by red tape. We at London business school are considering volunteering to be a test site for the inland revenue's new scheme to facilitate giving tax effectively through the internet. In sum, the new legislation will remove many of the obstacles that today discourage both newly wealthy entrepreneurs and older citizens doing estate planning from transferring their assets to charity. As a result, British charities will now be able to participate in the wealth created through stock market appreciation and new company listings just as their American counterparts do.",

Inside, James Ravilious's photographs capture rural life, hardship and celebration amid Devon's natural landscape. The Beaford Centre, for a couple of days twice a year, is home to the Torridge Funding Opportunities Group (Fog), a rural partnership in a community whose poverty belies the tranquil exterior. It is a district where unemployment is above the national average and isolation poses difficulties for the management of its transport and care infrastructure. Recently, it was given European Objective 2 status, alongside Plymouth and poorer parts of Bristol. The main aims of Fog are identifying funding opportunities, coordinating efforts, avoiding duplication of applications and securing inward investment. Membership of the group is open and newcomers join on a networking basis. Partnership development is tackled in two ways: thematically, covering elderly and young people, and housing; and project-based, such as Surestart programmes and healthy living centres. Steve Batt, from the county's European office, sees Fog \"integrating policy, funding streams and projects, so that groups can draw down quickly and get on\". The success of the group lies in Torridge's rural location and in the recognition by members of Torridge district council, the joint consultative committee and the partnership committee, of the need for a flexible approach in such an area. There is a sense of local identity, a well-developed network in place, and the small population allows easy mapping of existing work, key players and opportunities, which can create an atmosphere of trust. Ian Hobbs, former district manager of social services, who convenes and coordinates the network as the county council's local community development and partnership officer, says: \"There is a general sense of energy and personal commitment, a lack of jealousy over boundaries and a focus on doing what works and spending small money well.\" Importantly, the group can function with little bureaucracy because its members are already accountable to communities and organisations. Fog's function is a mix of networking, awareness-raising, training, even empowerment. It recognises that, in sustainable development, people themselves are resources, with spare capacity that can be released by relaxed conditions and action learning. A ndrew Lightfoot, of the Community Development Trust (CDT), says: \"Fog helps shape priorities for Torridge, but just as important is its role of offering mutual support to community workers struggling in isolation.\" Annie Brenton, from Capacity through Quality, agrees: \"Community groups need encouragement as well as leadership,\" she says. \"They need their real needs met, and Fog is a way of making those needs known.\" A user perspective of Fog looks for evidence of organisations taking up communities' own priorities and issues more effectively than before.

This is a gloomy scenario, but it is one that may account for the marked increase in the number of addict deaths that are now being seen in Strathclyde. </p> <p>Between 1994 and 1998, there were a total of 465 addict deaths in Strathclyde. In 1999, there were 148 drug-related deaths - a 33% increase on the previous year. </p> <p>The availability of higher-than-normal quality heroin on the streets of Glasgow and other parts of Strathclyde and the tendency of addicts in the west of Scotland to mix different drugs is part of the explanation for the number of deaths that are now being seen. It has also been shown that addicts recently released from prison are at high risk of overdosing if they resume their previous pattern of drug use. </p> <p>There is, though, another possible explanation for the marked increase in deaths that may mean we have only seen the tip of a much larger iceberg. </p> <p>In the mid-1980s, heroin use exploded in Glasgow. There were an estimated 5,000 heroin addicts in the city in 1985; by 1990, it was an estimated 8,500. On the basis of research carried out in the US, we know that after about 12 to 15 years of using illegal drugs many addicts approach the rock bottom phase of their addiction. This is a point of maximum despondency. </p> <p>In interviews carried out at Glasgow university with ex-addicts, it was clear that experiencing rock bottom could result in some addicts taking the decision to cease their drug use. Sally, an addict for 15 years, described the point when she decided to stop using illegal drugs: \"I really decided to clean up when my health was zero. I was covered in abscesses from head to toe. I was only six stone. Nobody would talk to me, nobody liked me and I didn't even like myself, and I thought that if I continued like this I was going to die. It came to the crunch and I said to myself either I'm going to die or I'm going to clean up. And that's when I decided to clean up.\" </p> <p>Other addicts hitting rock bottom may decide that their own life is hardly worth living. In interviews with addicts in hospital recovering from a non-fatal drug overdose, many were similarly pessimistic about their life but in their case they had decided to continue with the drug use that they knew could kill them. Many of these people had, it seemed, lost the will to live, and while their overdose was not necessarily a deliberate attempt to end their life, nevertheless, they had reached a point in their drug use where they were not bothered whether they lived or died. </p> <p>Karl, for example, started using illegal drugs in his early teens and was now aged 32. Homeless and recently released from prison, he said: \"A lot of people who are on drugs have got nothing to live for so they don't really care whether they live or die. That's how I go - I don't care if I catch the virus [HIV] or not.\" </p> <p>A 34-year-old female addict put it even more succinctly when she said: \"I couldn't give a shit if I died now. That's the way I feel.\" </p> <p>While the rock bottom experience of some addicts may help them to come off drugs, for others it may lead them to take ever greater risks with the drugs they are using. </p> <p>Although fatal drug overdoses are not confined to older addicts, those in their later 20s and early 30s are at particularly high risk of dying. The average age of addicts dying in Strathclyde in 1998 was 28. Many of these will have been using heroin and other illegal drugs for at least 10 years and are likely to have been experiencing the real low points of their addiction. </p> <p>In the interviews with 77 addicts recovering in hospital from an overdose, 49% said they had felt suicidal before taking the drugs that had nearly killed them, 63% had overdosed previously, 40% were currently homeless and 72% were unemployed. Many were at the end of the road of their addiction, at a point where an overdose could seem an all-too-easy way out of a life of unending misery. </p> <p>The first thing that needs to happen if the number of drug-related deaths is to be reduced is that every drug agency in contact with addicts who are in their late 20s and 30s, and who have been using illegal drugs for more than 10 years, must recognise that these individuals are at high risk of a fatal overdose. Since many of them will have been in contact with drug services for years, agency staff may have become so used to seeing them year after year that they assume they will always be there. In fact, they may be approaching a point where they are at greater risk of dying from their drug use than at any point in the past. </p> <p>Second, hospital casualty departments need to deal with drug addicts admitted for a non-fatal overdose in a much more intensive way than they do at present. While casualty staff will work valiantly to reverse the immediate effects of the drug overdose in what may be very difficult circumstances, most addicts then leave the hospital only to resume the drug use that had nearly killed them. </p> <p>There is a need to ensure that all drug users admitted for an overdose are offered the maximum help possible, including the opportunity to talk about their drug use and their risk-taking behaviour, and, if necessary, be referred to specialist psychiatric services. </p> <p>In many instances, they will also need follow-up support to reduce their risk of a subsequent fatal drug overdose. We need to ensure that, at the point where an addict is recovering from a non-fatal overdose, there is a maximum input of services. This is likely to be important not only in terms of reducing the likelihood of a subsequent fatal drug overdose but because the experience of the non-fatal overdose may help the individuals to realise that they are indeed at the end of the road of their addiction. </p> <p>There will be those who question whether we should seek to preserve the life of someone so set on his or her own self-destruction. But drug addiction is an illness, not a moral failing. If we hold back from doing our best to preserve the life of an addict, who is to say where such selective treatment may end? </p> <p>\u0095 Prof Neil McKeganey is director and Dr Joanne Neale a research fellow at the centre for drug misuse research, Glasgow university.</p>",

Last Saturday was national wood pigeon and corvid day, billed as Britain's biggest ever wild bird shoot. As wood pigeons and rooks straggled back across the sky to roost in the trees, it was time to get the hell out of there. </p> <p>Organised by the National Gamekeepers Organisation (NGO), 8,000 guns signed up to shoot wood pigeons and corvids - rooks, crows, magpies, jackdaws and jays. According to NGO, the mass shoot aimed to help farmers get rid of the wood pigeons, which damage crops, and corvids, which prey on other birds. It was, they said, about pest control and conservation. </p> <p>Or was it? Although small-scale roost shoots are a tradition at this time of year, just before the breeding season, there has not been a big national day for it since the 1950s and 1960s. The plan was to have so many guns blasting at the varmints that they would have no safe place to roost. </p> <p>A National Farmers Union survey carried out in 1992 claimed that wood pigeons did \u00a34m worth of damage annually, principally to oil seed rape and linseed crops during the winter. But this seems like a drop in the ocean compared with the \u00a3190m farmers receive in subsidies for these crops. Under the arable areas payment scheme, a farmer can get \u00a3427 per hectare of oil seed rape, even if it's poor quality or the wood pigeons ate it all. The emphasis is then on yield, with payments of \u00a3120 per ton, over and above the subsidies. So the wood pigeons affect the yield, but not the subsidy. </p> <p>However, recent research suggests that when crops like oil seed are browsed by wood pigeons it helps to thin out the individual plants, allowing the remaining ones to grow bigger - thus achieving a higher yeild. </p> <p>Given the level of public money being pumped into farming, you might expect those who want to kill wildlife to engage in some sort of public debate about it. With 40% of farmland birds lost since the mid-1970s, it seems cruelly ironic that those which have benefited from agricultural changes are now being persecuted. </p> <p>But, no. Gamekeepers and their landowning bosses were intent on firing away, regardless of any conservation concerns. </p> <p>In Shropshire, I asked the local wildlife trust what they thought of the shoot. Conservation officer John Tucker said: \"This will not have much effect on the wood pigeon population, which in winter is swollen by climatic refugees - birds from colder climates of Scandinavia and further east in Europe. A shoot will replicate conditions of a normal winter, when many die anyway. There are no ecological grounds for this shoot. It's just a day for gamekeepers to be united in a rather spurious cause.\" </p> <p>The RSPB said it was concerned that the 15-18 million winter population of wood pigeons represented a threat to crops, but was not so sure about the corvids. Crows and magpies may have a local impact on partidge, grouse and pheasants, which gamekeepers are interested in, but the jury is still out on whether they really do that much damage to other nesting birds. An RSPB spokesman says: \"We have misgivings that a general license to shoot these birds may be abused for sporting or political purposes.\" </p> <p>It seemed clear in the early reporting about national wood pigeon and corvid day that it was being used as a rally in support of the hunting community. The suggestion was that this was the alliance of rightwing countryside groups flexing more political muscle - putting on a show of strength and warning the government and the urban population what a committed and dangerous lobby they can be. </p> <p>All this was denied by Charles Nodder, acting as spokesman for NGO. \"This is not our aim at all,\" he said. \"Our aim is to tell people about the need for pest control, how useful field sports are and why we do what we do. We have been misrepresented. We have a job to do and people can draw their own conclusions.\" </p> <p>There are many people who will draw the same conclusions as Andrew Tyler, of Animal Aid. He says: \"This is disgusting. Thousand of birds have been killed and even more will have died a slow lingering death from their injuries, just so that the field sports lobby can make a point. I don't believe this had anything to do with conservation - as the gamekeepers claim. I believe it was a sick political project.\"</p>",

They can be placed in care in a variety of circumstances: under an interim or full care order made by a court; if they are subject to police protection or an emergency or child protection order; if they are committed or remanded to local authority accommodation or made the subject of a residence requirement of a supervision order in criminal proceedings; if they have been sentenced under section 53 of the Child and Young Persons Act 1933. <p>Social services for children in England and Wales are provided under the provisions of the Children Act 1989 which came into force in October 1991. In Scotland the statute is the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 which was implemented in 1997.</p> <p><b>How many are in care? </b><br> The latest figures for England show that social services departments looked after 55,300 children in 1999, a 4% increase on 1998. Of these 36,100 were in foster homes, 4,800 in community homes, 1,000 in hostels, 6,200 with their own parents and 2,900 were placed for adoption. 55% were boys.</p> <p><b>How old are they? </b><br> The largest group - 22,300 children were aged 10 to 15. There were 9,000 over 16, 12,500 aged between 5 and 9 and 11,400 under fives. </p> <p><b>What about children at risk? </b><br> Each social services department holds a central register which lists all the children in the area who are considered to be suffering from or likely to suffer significant harm. Registration takes place at a child protection conference. In England and Wales last year there were 31,000 children on registers. The peak was in 1991 with 43,300 cases. </p> <p><b>What sort of abuse do they suffer? </b><br> The main reason for being placed on a register continued to be neglect with 13,900 cases. This is defined as persistent neglect or failure to protect a child from exposure to any kind of danger, including cold or starvation, or a failure to carry out important aspects of care leading to significant impairment of a child's health or development.</p> <p>The second highest category is physical abuse with 9,100 cases. Sexual abuse accounted for 6,600 cases and emotional abuse 5,400. The number at risk from physical or sexual abuse continued to fall while the numbers at risk from neglect and emotional abuse rose. Under the Family Law Act 1997 a suspected abuser can be removed from the family home, rather than taking the child away as was the case before.</p> <p><b>How far does alcohol play a role in child abuse? </b><br> An estimated 920,000 children in the UK could be living in a family where a parent has an alcohol problem. Research shows that alcohol is a factor in a third of child abuse cases, while young people in families with a drinking parent are much more liable to suffer from psychiatric disorders. An Alcohol Concern study found that living with a problem drinking parent can take away a young person's childhood, forcing them to shoulder responsibilities for beyond what could be expected.</p> <p><b>What's the role of adoption? </b><br> About a third of all children adopted have been looked after by a local authority. Two thousand were adopted in 1999, slightly more boys than girls, with an average age of 4 years 11 months.</p> <p><b>What is the government doing to prevent any repetition of the scandal in Wales?</b><br> After the disclosure of past abuse in children's homes, the previous Conservative government set up an inquiry. The report concluded that abuse on such a scale is now unlikely to happen in children's homes, a view supported yesterday by the Association of Directors of Social Services. It recommended that the government implement a strategy to drive up the standards in children's homes. The response from the former health secretary Frank Dobson in September 1988 was the Quality Protects Programme, which instructed local authorities to draw up an action plan and appoint an official to monitor it.</p>",

Of these 36,100 were in foster homes, 4,800 in community homes, 1,000 in hostels, 6,200 with their own parents and 2,900 were placed for adoption. 55% were boys. How old are they? The largest group - 22,300 children were aged 10 to 15. There were 9,000 over 16, 12,500 aged between 5 and 9 and 11,400 under fives. What about children at risk? Each social services department holds a central register which lists all the children in the area who are considered to be suffering from or likely to suffer significant harm. Registration takes place at a child protection conference. In England and Wales last year there were 31,000 children on registers. The peak was in 1991 with 43,300 cases. What sort of abuse do they suffer? The main reason for being placed on a register continued to be neglect with 13,900 cases. This is defined as persistent neglect or failure to protect a child from exposure to any kind of danger, including cold or starvation, or a failure to carry out important aspects of care leading to significant impairment of a child's health or development. The second highest category is physical abuse with 9,100 cases. Sexual abuse accounted for 6,600 cases and emotional abuse 5,400. The number at risk from physical or sexual abuse continued to fall while the numbers at risk from neglect and emotional abuse rose. Under the Family Law Act 1997 a suspected abuser can be removed from the family home, rather than taking the child away as was the case before. How far does alcohol play a role in child abuse? An estimated 920,000 children in the UK could be living in a family where a parent has an alcohol problem. Research shows that alcohol is a factor in a third of child abuse cases, while young people in families with a drinking parent are much more liable to suffer from psychiatric disorders. An Alcohol Concern study found that living with a problem drinking parent can take away a young person's childhood, forcing them to shoulder responsibilities for beyond what could be expected. What's the role of adoption? About a third of all children adopted have been looked after by a local authority. Two thousand were adopted in 1999, slightly more boys than girls, with an average age of 4 years 11 months. What is the government doing to prevent any repetition of the scandal in Wales? After the disclosure of past abuse in children's homes, the previous Conservative government set up an inquiry. The report concluded that abuse on such a scale is now unlikely to happen in children's homes, a view supported yesterday by the Association of Directors of Social Services. It recommended that the government implement a strategy to drive up the standards in children's homes. The response from the former health secretary Frank Dobson in September 1988 was the Quality Protects Programme, which instructed local authorities to draw up an action plan and appoint an official to monitor it.",

The cyanide spill has already sparked complaints from Yugoslavia, which issued a protest note to the Rumanian embassy in Belgrade yesterday.</p> <p>The note cited \"serious damage caused by the destruction of fish in the Tisza and the hazard to the riverside\". The Geneva-based Green Cross International said the cyanide had killed all living species in its path and threatened to contaminate the Black Sea.</p> <p>The group blamed the west for its failure to provide enough funds to rebuild the destroyed economies of the region and to upgrade obsolete industrial infrastructure, or to impose the kind of regulations necessary to prevent accidents.</p> <p>Yugoslav ecologists warned of long-term food poisoning and dangerous metal concentrations that have already killed tons of fish in the contaminated Danube and Tisza rivers.</p> <p>\"Dead fish are covering the rivers, and 400,000 birds that find winter shelter in the Yugoslav part of the Danube River are threatened,\" said prominent ecologist Radoje Lausevic. He warned there was a great danger that the river pollution - which was dozens of times above normal levels - could contaminate the food chain through groundwater and water used for irrigation.</p> <p>The cyanide poured into streams from a containment dam at a gold mine near the Rumanian town of Baia Mare on January 30, returning to Rumania after passing through Hungary and Yugoslavia via the Szamos and Tisza rivers. The World Health Organisation earlier expressed concern that heavy metals such as lead and cadmium also might have escaped into the water, posing a potentially far greater health threat.</p> <p>Esmeralda, the Australian company that co-owns the Baia Mare gold mine, has denied responsibility for the cyanide spill, saying the extent of poisoning had been exaggerated. Rumania has argued that the damage was overstated and that it suffered the most. Hungary and Yugoslavia have demanded compensation from Romania; both have threatened to sue Bucharest if their demands are not met.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hungary today confirmed that it will take legal action over the cyanide spill that has destroyed the ecosystems of two of its rivers in the worst European environmental disaster since Chernobyl. Prime minister Viktor Orban said his country is planning three lawsuits: against the Rumanian-Australian gold mining joint venture, its Australian parent company and against Rumania in the international courts for compensation. Mr Orban said the aftermath of the cyanide contamination could spark tensions in bilateral relations, but added that that Hungary had to defend its interests to the fullest possible extent. The cyanide spill has already sparked complaints from Yugoslavia, which issued a protest note to the Rumanian embassy in Belgrade yesterday. The note cited \"serious damage caused by the destruction of fish in the Tisza and the hazard to the riverside\". The Geneva-based Green Cross International said the cyanide had killed all living species in its path and threatened to contaminate the Black Sea. The group blamed the west for its failure to provide enough funds to rebuild the destroyed economies of the region and to upgrade obsolete industrial infrastructure, or to impose the kind of regulations necessary to prevent accidents. Yugoslav ecologists warned of long-term food poisoning and dangerous metal concentrations that have already killed tons of fish in the contaminated Danube and Tisza rivers. \"Dead fish are covering the rivers, and 400,000 birds that find winter shelter in the Yugoslav part of the Danube River are threatened,\" said prominent ecologist Radoje Lausevic. He warned there was a great danger that the river pollution - which was dozens of times above normal levels - could contaminate the food chain through groundwater and water used for irrigation. The cyanide poured into streams from a containment dam at a gold mine near the Rumanian town of Baia Mare on January 30, returning to Rumania after passing through Hungary and Yugoslavia via the Szamos and Tisza rivers. The World Health Organisation earlier expressed concern that heavy metals such as lead and cadmium also might have escaped into the water, posing a potentially far greater health threat. Esmeralda, the Australian company that co-owns the Baia Mare gold mine, has denied responsibility for the cyanide spill, saying the extent of poisoning had been exaggerated. Rumania has argued that the damage was overstated and that it suffered the most. Hungary and Yugoslavia have demanded compensation from Romania; both have threatened to sue Bucharest if their demands are not met.",

      "body": "<p>Sentimentalism is the working off on yourself of feelings you haven't really got,\" DH Lawrence once wrote. \"Very few people really feel love, or sex passion, or kindliness, or anything else that goes at all deep. So the mass just fake these feelings inside themselves. Faked feelings! The world is all gummy with them.\" </p> <p>The Green Mile - which has Oscar nominations for best film, best sound, best screenplay adaptation and best supporting actor (Michael Clarke Duncan) - is sentimental, and not just because it stars Tom Hanks as a prison guard, playing another of his nice American Everyman roles. It's sentimental because it manipulates us into feeling a great deal, then leaves us red-eyed in the foyer, wondering if our emotion has any value. </p> <p>The Green Mile is set in a death row prison block in Louisiana in 1935. A man mountain of a black prisoner is brought into a cell to await execution for the rape and murder of two white girls. Frank Darabont's film affects to be challenging by confounding our expectations about the milieu in which it is set. The prison guards (all white) are good and non-racist, apart from one crudely drawn baddie. The black inmate, John Coffey (Duncan), is set up as an ogre, but turns out to be an innocent with magical powers. Despite several electric chair executions shown in purportedly upsetting detail, this is not - unlike Dead Man Walking - a film that proselytises against capital punishment. </p> <p>In fact, for all its cunning confounding of expectations and provoking of emotions, it's not at all clear what, if anything, the film is saying. And it takes a very long time to say it. Adapted from Stephen King's six-part novel published in 1996, it is 188 minutes long. While it's not as rambling as most recent King fiction, it still has more back story and leisurely character development than you could shake a stick at. There's even a subplot about Paul Edgecombe's (Tom Hanks's) urinary infection, which, given that the film is long enough to warrant at least one trip to the loo, is a bold move. Never before has a lead actor been to the toilet so often in a movie; never before, I'll bet, has a double Oscar winner been required to yell \"I'm pissing razor blades\" from his cubicle. </p> <p>But really. What's wrong with a good long sentimental film? You know, one of those that often involve Hanks or Meg Ryan or both. There's a huge audience for this kind of blubbathon, for a Titanic, a Schindler's List, a Saving Private Ryan or a Green Mile. Darabont's film has taken $120m in the US and is poised to fill British multiplexes later this month. </p> <p>Darabont suspects that these audiences want to purge their emotions. And perhaps - contra Lawrence - it doesn't matter too much what those feelings are about; to have them at all in the cinema is enough. \"To me the core of film- making is to stir the emotions of the audience,\" says Darabont. </p> <p>He has written, produced and worked on many films but directed just two, the other being The Shawshank Redemption. Both are based on King novels, both are set in prison, both have redemptive, humanistic messages that have proved appealing and lucrative. Darabont is becoming a latterday Frank Capra, wallowing in sentiment in an unashamedly Ameri can way that makes snooty critics sniffy. His next film, which he hopes to shoot later this year, he describes as a Capra-esque romantic comedy set during the McCarthyite blacklisting in the 50s. It will, he promises, be sentimental. \"There's nothing wrong with honest sentiment,\" he says. \"It's a Wonderful Life is my favourite movie of all time, which should tell you something. </p> <p>\"Both films I have made are very moving,\" says Darabont. \"They both say something very positive about the human heart and I think it's something people crave to hear.\" </p> <p>Even when Darabont, 41, was a film student he was trying to make movies of King's books: \"I've always been drawn to his voice as an author. To me he's up there with Dickens, who was a great populist storyteller.\" </p> <p>Doesn't he think The Green Mile is too long, that the framing devices could have been cut, and that the execution scenes are self-indulgent? \"No, and apparently neither does the audience in the US. It's been a huge success,\" he says, understandably defensive. \"I can mention precious few great 90-minute movies, but I can reel off many great films that are three hours plus, starting off with Mr Lean's work, Mr Kubrick's work and Mr Cameron's work. </p> <p>\"If you're gonna go on a rich emotional journey with the storyteller, then you need to get to know the characters. I don't think the boat started sinking until nearly two hours into Titanic. If the boat had started sinking after 30 minutes, I wouldn't have cared as much about those characters.\" </p> <p> The Green Mile is, as Darabont recognises, a cunningly manipulative film. \"Every frame of every movie is an attempt by the artist to manipulate the perceptions or emotions of the viewer. The point is, do you appreciate the manipulation or resent it? Do you notice it, or do you completely, blindly give yourself over to it?\" </p> <p>The problem is that the film constructs a reassuring moral universe out of what was a cruel prison system, and thus short-circuits our emotions, making them unproblematically uplifting and not worth reflecting upon. This, after all, was the South of Jim Crow, this was the penal system that used the chain gang, the whip and the club. Louisiana state penitentiary was one of the most violent penal institutions in America. Only last year a documentary called The Farm: Angola USA showed that racism was still rife there. Darabont's film is seemingly oblivious to all this. Shouldn't he have made a more substantial film? </p> <p>Darabont believes he has. \"I enjoy the fact that we might give the audience something to think about - the death penalty, race relations, miracles, our relationship with a higher power. But I don't want to make up people's minds for them. I love that we had an earlier era of films in which you would leave the theatre but not leave the movie behind. You'd go out with your friends and talk about it for three hours over coffee. I'm hearing from a lot of people that this is the effect it's having and I think that's wonderful.\" </p> <p>But what are they talking about? About racism in the US? Darabont thinks so. \"With The Green Mile, King is saying something very compelling about the relationship between the races at that time. Maybe not just at that time, but forever. And the message is: don't judge a book by its cover. There's magic in all of us if you look closely enough.\" </p> <p>But that message is sentimental and expresses only a facile truth. And indeed, The Green Mile's simplistic vision of the world is one in which the bad guys have shifty eyes and are sadistic to pet mice. It's one in which black men cannot be allowed to be bad and white men cannot be racist. Consequently, racism is not treated seriously. Instead, Coffey is an instinctive healer who helps Hanks with his waterworks. </p> <p>The Green Mile inhabits a soothing dreamworld in which audiences can experience strong yet vague feelings and leave the cinema thinking life is beautiful. The sentimentality is akin to that characterised by the philosopher Professor Malcolm Budd in his book Values of Art. Such sentimentality \"involves the wilful neglect of various aspects of the target of the emotion that would necessitate a more complex and less rewarding response; a false intensity of experience is gained by ignoring any features that militate against the simple, one-sided response which typically idealises, glamorises or romanticises the target, making it tug at the heartstrings.\" </p> <p>And yet there is, and perhaps always has been, a big demand for such heartstring tugging. No wonder Darabont is keen to compare King to Dickens. \"Dickens was a bleeding heart for humanism, he had a wide open heart for humanity. Now people are catching on to the fact that King is very much more like that than they thought, largely I think because of the film of Stand By Me and, I suspect, the films I've made.\" </p> <p>Darabont has undeniably caught King's gushing humanism. When Coffey walks the Green Mile (the title is a reference to the colour of linoleum on the death row floor) to the electric chair, everyone on screen seems to be crying. Coffey is crying. The guards are carrying on like they're Gwyneth Paltrow at Oscar time. Even Hanks's chin is twitching. It's Dickensian sentimental overload: like the death of Little Nell in The Old Curiosity Shop, it would take a heart of stone not to laugh at the scene. Or maybe I'm cynical. </p> <p>Maybe not. I tell Darabont that the most affecting execution scene I have seen in film was in Kieslowski's A Short Film About Killing. A young man is hanged for the vile murder of a taxi driver. Has he seen Kieslowski's film? Darabont admits he has not, but perhaps he should. It takes the viewer on an emotional journey at the end of which we question our feelings rather than merely have them and leave them in drenched Kleenexes on the cinema floor. And it makes us sit around over coffee for hours afterwards arguing about substantial things - about whether there is a moral difference between murder and state killings. DH Lawrence might have liked Kieslowski's film but not, surely, Darabont's.</p> <p>\u0095The Green Mile is released on February 25.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sentimentalism is the working off on yourself of feelings you haven't really got,\" DH Lawrence once wrote. \"Very few people really feel love, or sex passion, or kindliness, or anything else that goes at all deep. So the mass just fake these feelings inside themselves. Faked feelings! The world is all gummy with them.\" The Green Mile - which has Oscar nominations for best film, best sound, best screenplay adaptation and best supporting actor (Michael Clarke Duncan) - is sentimental, and not just because it stars Tom Hanks as a prison guard, playing another of his nice American Everyman roles. It's sentimental because it manipulates us into feeling a great deal, then leaves us red-eyed in the foyer, wondering if our emotion has any value. The Green Mile is set in a death row prison block in Louisiana in 1935. A man mountain of a black prisoner is brought into a cell to await execution for the rape and murder of two white girls. Frank Darabont's film affects to be challenging by confounding our expectations about the milieu in which it is set. The prison guards (all white) are good and non-racist, apart from one crudely drawn baddie. The black inmate, John Coffey (Duncan), is set up as an ogre, but turns out to be an innocent with magical powers. Despite several electric chair executions shown in purportedly upsetting detail, this is not - unlike Dead Man Walking - a film that proselytises against capital punishment. In fact, for all its cunning confounding of expectations and provoking of emotions, it's not at all clear what, if anything, the film is saying. And it takes a very long time to say it. Adapted from Stephen King's six-part novel published in 1996, it is 188 minutes long. While it's not as rambling as most recent King fiction, it still has more back story and leisurely character development than you could shake a stick at. There's even a subplot about Paul Edgecombe's (Tom Hanks's) urinary infection, which, given that the film is long enough to warrant at least one trip to the loo, is a bold move. Never before has a lead actor been to the toilet so often in a movie; never before, I'll bet, has a double Oscar winner been required to yell \"I'm pissing razor blades\" from his cubicle. But really. What's wrong with a good long sentimental film? You know, one of those that often involve Hanks or Meg Ryan or both. There's a huge audience for this kind of blubbathon, for a Titanic, a Schindler's List, a Saving Private Ryan or a Green Mile. Darabont's film has taken $120m in the US and is poised to fill British multiplexes later this month. Darabont suspects that these audiences want to purge their emotions. And perhaps - contra Lawrence - it doesn't matter too much what those feelings are about; to have them at all in the cinema is enough. \"To me the core of film- making is to stir the emotions of the audience,\" says Darabont. He has written, produced and worked on many films but directed just two, the other being The Shawshank Redemption. Both are based on King novels, both are set in prison, both have redemptive, humanistic messages that have proved appealing and lucrative. Darabont is becoming a latterday Frank Capra, wallowing in sentiment in an unashamedly Ameri can way that makes snooty critics sniffy. His next film, which he hopes to shoot later this year, he describes as a Capra-esque romantic comedy set during the McCarthyite blacklisting in the 50s. It will, he promises, be sentimental. \"There's nothing wrong with honest sentiment,\" he says. \"It's a Wonderful Life is my favourite movie of all time, which should tell you something. \"Both films I have made are very moving,\" says Darabont. \"They both say something very positive about the human heart and I think it's something people crave to hear.\" Even when Darabont, 41, was a film student he was trying to make movies of King's books: \"I've always been drawn to his voice as an author.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The titular hero of The Talented Mr. Ripley is a man with his nose pressed up against the glass. Through the sun-dappled resort-land of the Italian Riviera he goes; a star-struck interloper from the wrong side of the tracks. He hungers for a new lifestyle, a change of identity. Cool, easy-living Dickie Greenleaf - bumming around Europe on his daddy's allowance - embodies everything that Ripley desires. The pauper looks at the playboy and wants to possess him. </p> <p>On reading Patricia Highsmith's source novel twenty years ago, writer-director Anthony Minghella felt an immediate affinity with this gauche, questing anti-hero. Certainly the man's own upbringing on the Isle of Wight reads like a peculiarly anglicised take on the Ripley tale. The son of working-class Italian parents, Cinderella Minghella's weekends were spent working inside the family ice-cream van, serving cones and ices to the island bourgeousie. \"For me,\" he remembers, \"every English person was a Dickie Greenleaf.\"</p> <p>In a sense, then, Minghella's career history has been an uphill struggle from humble origins. The gloss and polish on show in The Talented Mr. Ripley is the result of years of careful honing. As an aspiring writer, he cut his teeth in local theatre and the TV treadmill. He wrote scripts for Inspector Morse and toiled through a regular gig on Grange Hill. During the Nineties, he began picking up speed. His debut feature --1991's Highgate-set romantic fable Truly, Madly, Deeply - was a successful calling-card, while film number-two - 1993's Mr. Wonderful - broke him into the American film industry. In 1997 he took an oblique, complicated, darn-near unfilmable novel called The English Patient and converted it into a critics' favourite, a box-office hit and Oscar-winner for Best Picture and Best Director. </p> <p>Released in the UK next week, The Talented Mr. Ripley follows The English Patient's tried-and-tested tack of translating a book to the screen. Indeed, such is Minghella's success in this area that he's even planning on doing it again - his next project will be an adaptation of Charles Frazier's Civil War novel Cold Mountain. \"I think the problem with being a playwright from an early age is that you start patrolling the same ground,\" he tells me. \"You start telling the same story, making the same film. Adapting a book stops you falling into a pattern of repetition. Also there's an attraction of almost having an argument or a discourse with the novel. It takes you to places you wouldn't normally go. I mean, Cold Mountain is about the American Civil War and the romance of nature, and none of that feels comfortable to me. In the same way, Patricia Highsmith and I are not natural bedfellows. But it's fun to have that argument with the material. It stretches you in new directions.\"</p> <p>In the case of The Talented Mr. Ripley, then, he somehow conspires to remould Highsmith's snappy pulp thriller into a sweeping, well-toned examination of class envy and identity. Minghella initially came to the project three years ago, in the fraught months when funding for The English Patient kept falling through. It was intially conceived as a smaller scale picture, until the runaway success of The English Patient beefed it into a bona-fide Hollywood spectacular. \"It wasn't so much that The English Patient inflated Ripley as the fact that I began to sense the story's possibilities,\" Minghella argues. \"I realised how what was essentially a suspense story, a thriller, could become the vehicle to enable the film to talk about more profound things than the book did. In a sense, I realised what Ripley could be, and that it couldn't be a little chamber piece any longer.\"</p> <p>Such a transformation brought its own set of problems. Because, love it or not, Ripley is an uncharacteristically dark and edgy Hollywood product. Its lead character (ably played by Matt Damon) is at once pathetic and horribly pro-active; a serial-killer with homosexual leanings. There have been rumours in the press of studio concern over aspects of the picture, and script rewrites undertaken on the insistence of co-star Gwyneth Paltrow. \"Let's just say there were appropriate anxieties about the film,\" Minghella says. \"But film-making is a long process and attitudes don't change in a day. It's much more organic than that. So yes, there was resistance to Ripley over a period of many months. Oddly enough, the more interested that Miramax were in the film the more nervous they became. It had big stars and a bigger budget, so there was much more to lose and inevitably the story's subject comes under more scrutiny. Luckily for me, The English Patient had been a big hit so my judgement was more trusted than it otherwise might have been.\"</p> <p>This is not to say that Ripley is some wild guerrilla missive in the style of Todd Solondz's Happiness or Lars Von Trier's The Idiots. Minghella doesn't make movies like that. His story's dark interiors come covered with a pristine surface (all sumptuous locations and pretty star faces). You might even feel that The Talented Mr. Ripley is just too darn refined. Reviewing the film in the online magazine Salon, Charles Taylor likened the picture to \"an expensive desert cart propelled by a discreet waiter. After a while you get the message - Anthony Minghella doesn't want to get his hands dirty.\"</p> <p>Minghella admits it - up to a point. \"The more I understand about film-making the more meticulous I want to be. And yes, there's a great deal to be said for throwing all that away. I recently made a three-minute film for Comic Relief in Nairobi where we were just shooting and moving, hanging the camera out of the back of the car, and it was wonderful. But to a certain extent you have to make peace with yourself. There is a scale of film that I naturally gravitate to - films that are larger and more formal and have this careful finish to every frame. That is the style of film-making that I find myself drawn to and I have grown to respect my own voice.\"</p> <p>On current evidence, Hollywood does too. The Talented Mr. Ripley has already eclipsed The English Patient in terms of American box-office takings, and if its sum total of five Oscar nominations is a shade down on The English Patient's tally of nine, the failure is only relative. \"Exactly,\" says the director. \"There's nothing like having such an incandescent success as The English Patient to make everything else look dim.\" </p> <p>Minghella claims to treat both monetary and Academy success with a hefty pinch of salt. The fact remains, though, that the director has carved a career making the sort of classy star-vehicles that appear tailor-made for both. If the young Minghella craved a place at Hollywood's top tabel, he's now got it, with bells on. The English Patient made his reputation. Ripley has secured it. \"I know that the commentators were looking to label me as a one-hit wonder, so I'm very comforted to have avoided that,\" he admits. \"I don't feel I've got anything to prove as a film-maker now. Having said that, Oscars and box-office don't actually have any effect on the content of a film. Certainly The English Patient wasn't any better the day after the Oscars than it was before. I can't imagine that Ripley will be either.\"</p>",

In the best-picture category, alongside the predictably board-sweeping American Beauty, there's Michael Mann's old-fashioned torn-from-today's-headlines drama The Insider; The Cider House Rules, a cosy, handsome John Irving adaptation; and The Green Mile, a three-hour-plus prison drama. I'd like to see The Sixth Sense win, because it's small but smart and doesn't stand on ceremony, and it would strike a rare Oscar blow for the genre pic. I suspect it won't win, because Oscar loves a consensus. </p> <p>That would make the winner American Beauty - also nominated for cinematography, direction, editing, score and original script, with acting nominations for Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening (but no supporting actor for Chris Cooper, who, for me, was the real star turn). This is an Oscar consensus movie par excellence: superbly acted and directed, clever and amusing, yet so much less of a big deal than it appears. The Academy can't handle messy, sprawling movies that blaze away under their own febrile inspiration - that's why it has traditionally given short shrift to directors like Altman and Scorsese, and why there are a few notable omissions this year. </p> <p>David Fincher's audacious, wildly misunderstood Fight Club gets only a derisory sound-effects-editing nomination. Paul Thomas Anderson's bustling Magnolia should have been a possible best film (it gets a screenplay mention, and one for Tom Cruise as supporting actor). Mike Leigh's Topsy-Turvy also gets short-changed, with a few technical nominations and best screenplay, but no show for the great Jim Broadbent. </p> <p>It's worth noting that one triumph doesn't guarantee you a sinecure: after The English Patient, there's a scant showing for Anthony Minghella with the far better The Talented Mr Ripley, and a rotten one for Scott Hicks's follow-up to Shine, the dreary Snow Falling on Cedars (Paint Drying on Cedars, more like). It's reassuring too that apparent Oscar certs don't always register - The End of the Affair gets only a best-actress nomination for Julianne Moore. </p> <p>Most interesting are those best actor/actress surprise nominations that are almost programmed into the event. There's the obligatory Meryl Streep showing for a heart-warming but inconsequential film (Music of the Heart). There's the congratulations-on-still-being-alive best actor for Richard Farnsworth, from The Straight Story. And there's the wild-card nomination for someone in a film no one has seen: Janet McTeer in single-mom drama Tumbleweeds. </p> <p>The most interesting nominations are among the supporting-actress nominees, for newish names with indie records - Toni Collette, Angelina Jolie, Catherine Keener, Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Samantha Morton. I'd favour Keener, from Being John Malkovich: her supervamp role is so wildly at odds with her usual ingenue parts that it reveals her to be more versatile than anyone dreamed. </p> <p>Among the best-actress names is Hilary Swank, who plays the gender-troubled Teena Brandon/ Brandon Teena in Boys Don't Cry. Her vibrant performance is more complex and unnerving than the Oscars usually reward.

      "body": "<p>Can we trust this government with the sex education of our children? I ask because they have swung between libertarian pressure groups and pro-family moralists without a single thought about what contemporary teenagers themselves might need or want. </p> <p>The government, which has done so many recent U-turns, has so far been strangely firm on repealing section 28. Campaigners are delighted at this commitment to ending discrimination and contemptuous of suggestions in the rightwing press that this unexpected firmness results from a cabinet driven by sexual sympathies. If the cabinet is a sexually motley crew, they say, so is the rest of the world. This would explain their desire to enshrine \"the live and let live\" principle in sex education. </p> <p>Forgive my cynicism, but this is not a live and let live government. Its natural instinct is to interfere, and moralise: ask any single mother if the last two years have increased or reduced tolerance of her situation. So it's safe to assume there is some deep commitment to the guiding principles of the repeal section 28 campaign: a belief that there is no such thing as \"normal\" sexuality; that no one should feel bad about their preferences; and that gay relationships should not be presented as \"pretend\" or less valuable. </p> <p>Now the government has realised the extent of Middle England's resistance to repealing section 28, they are desperately trying to pacify the traditionalists who think the precise opposite; that children should be taught the boundaries of what is normal and abnormal, desirable and undesirable. Blunkett is proposing children should be taught that marriage is the \"proper\" relationship, thus discriminating against the millions of children, like mine, whose parents are happily unmarried. Perhaps they will manage a compromise; sex comes in all shapes and sizes, all sex is good, but when it comes to children, marriage is best. But this can only ever be a face-saving formula and will spectacularly fail to address what contemporary children need. </p> <p>Over the past few weeks, endless bleeding-heart accounts of growing up gay in a homophobic society have implied nothing has changed around sex. This is nonsense. But the changes are seismic and children need different guidance in this sexually very literate society. Contemporary children are saturated with sexual imagery and information. The major soap operas regularly tackle homosexuality. It's also widely discussed in teenage magazines, along with how to do a blow job, premature ejaculation and so on. On Channel 5, there's all-night porn. With a couple of clicks they can (and do) download anything they like from the internet. Homosexual buggery is the least of it. If they prefer they can have bestiality, coprophilia, sex with tiny children. </p> <p>In such a context it is frankly absurd to be struggling over these Janet-and-John versus John-and-Jim versions of sexuality. The terrain is infinitely more difficult and all adolescents - regardless of gay or heterosexual identity - are struggling with much more complex issues. How can they avoid damaging sexual diseases? What is safe sexual behaviour? What should they agree to do or ask someone else to do in sex? Most critically, how does the experimental, transgressive sex with which they are bombarded ever become the \"normal\" family life most of them see around them? </p> <p> It is not gay adolescents who are at sea; it is all of them. None of them knows where to draw boundaries or how to understand what they really want, as opposed to what is being fed to them by outside interests. Girls remain particularly vulnerable to the flood of endorsing and inciting material. To find their way through all this, children have no need at all of these old-fashioned political ideologies, whether libertarian or conservative. They need basic facts of life, and information about health and contraception. More importantly, they need help developing self-esteem and confidence so they can chart their way through the sexual landscape, making choices which do not hurt others or damage themselves. </p> <p>Last year I visited a drug education project in Norway. There they start teaching the children at 11. It is not the sort of muddled stuff we do here: \"Now children, if you must inject, always use a clean needle.\" In fact they don't talk about drugs directly at all. Instead they help children develop confidence and self-esteem, encouraging them to speak about what matters to them and how to communicate this to others. There are important lessons for sex education. The real issues are emotional literacy, self-awareness and confidence to protect yourself. This is what the government should be addressing, not how to satisfy the outmoded ideologies of the sexual campaigners.</p>",

If the cabinet is a sexually motley crew, they say, so is the rest of the world. This would explain their desire to enshrine \"the live and let live\" principle in sex education. Forgive my cynicism, but this is not a live and let live government. Its natural instinct is to interfere, and moralise: ask any single mother if the last two years have increased or reduced tolerance of her situation. So it's safe to assume there is some deep commitment to the guiding principles of the repeal section 28 campaign: a belief that there is no such thing as \"normal\" sexuality; that no one should feel bad about their preferences; and that gay relationships should not be presented as \"pretend\" or less valuable. Now the government has realised the extent of Middle England's resistance to repealing section 28, they are desperately trying to pacify the traditionalists who think the precise opposite; that children should be taught the boundaries of what is normal and abnormal, desirable and undesirable. Blunkett is proposing children should be taught that marriage is the \"proper\" relationship, thus discriminating against the millions of children, like mine, whose parents are happily unmarried. Perhaps they will manage a compromise; sex comes in all shapes and sizes, all sex is good, but when it comes to children, marriage is best. But this can only ever be a face-saving formula and will spectacularly fail to address what contemporary children need. Over the past few weeks, endless bleeding-heart accounts of growing up gay in a homophobic society have implied nothing has changed around sex. This is nonsense. But the changes are seismic and children need different guidance in this sexually very literate society. Contemporary children are saturated with sexual imagery and information. The major soap operas regularly tackle homosexuality. It's also widely discussed in teenage magazines, along with how to do a blow job, premature ejaculation and so on. On Channel 5, there's all-night porn. With a couple of clicks they can (and do) download anything they like from the internet. Homosexual buggery is the least of it. If they prefer they can have bestiality, coprophilia, sex with tiny children. In such a context it is frankly absurd to be struggling over these Janet-and-John versus John-and-Jim versions of sexuality. The terrain is infinitely more difficult and all adolescents - regardless of gay or heterosexual identity - are struggling with much more complex issues. How can they avoid damaging sexual diseases? What is safe sexual behaviour? What should they agree to do or ask someone else to do in sex? Most critically, how does the experimental, transgressive sex with which they are bombarded ever become the \"normal\" family life most of them see around them? It is not gay adolescents who are at sea; it is all of them. None of them knows where to draw boundaries or how to understand what they really want, as opposed to what is being fed to them by outside interests. Girls remain particularly vulnerable to the flood of endorsing and inciting material. To find their way through all this, children have no need at all of these old-fashioned political ideologies, whether libertarian or conservative. They need basic facts of life, and information about health and contraception. More importantly, they need help developing self-esteem and confidence so they can chart their way through the sexual landscape, making choices which do not hurt others or damage themselves. Last year I visited a drug education project in Norway. There they start teaching the children at 11. It is not the sort of muddled stuff we do here: \"Now children, if you must inject, always use a clean needle.\" In fact they don't talk about drugs directly at all. Instead they help children develop confidence and self-esteem, encouraging them to speak about what matters to them and how to communicate this to others. There are important lessons for sex education. The real issues are emotional literacy, self-awareness and confidence to protect yourself. This is what the government should be addressing, not how to satisfy the outmoded ideologies of the sexual campaigners.",

Alison Stanley, an immigration specialist at the law firm of Bindman and Partners, said the action was legal but was neither fair nor good practice for former hostages still stressed and bewildered by the hijacking, which ended at Stansted airport last Thursday. The home office said 76 passengers were seeking asylum, including two previously arrested on suspicion of involvement in the hijacking but since released. Of those, 37 are \"principal\" applicants and the remainder wives and children. Ms Stanley said: \"All the others are being interviewed and their lawyers aren't being allowed to speak to them before they are interviewed about their full asylum claim.\" Her criticisms are believed to be shared by officials at the Refugee Legal Centre, which is now organising representation for the asylum-seekers at Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, but no one from the organisation could comment yesterday. The centre is farming out some legal help to agencies and lawyers, including Ms Stanley. After the first interview, the asylum-seekers have five days to amass further information in support of their claim. The home office said legal advice would have been provided before interview to anyone who had requested it. Ms Stanley said: \"These people are particularly vulnerable and they should have had proper legal advice before they made a legal decision about whether to seek asylum in the first place, and then subsequently having made that decision, before they were interviewed about their asylum claims.\" The criticism adds to that voiced by David Fazel, an interpreter for the hostages, who said he was \"quite disgusted\" by their treatment. He said immigration officials had warned applicants that if they were re fused asylum, \"they would be sent straight back to Afghanistan whether they were happy or not\". The asylum-seekers will be dispersed to other centres at the end of this week to await a decision by home secretary, Jack Straw, who has promised to look at each case quickly. Those turned down then have seven days to appeal. It costs \u00a31,300 a week to house and secure each asylum-seeker, a home office spokesman said. The 73 hostages who chose to return to Afghanistan on Monday were given advice on leaving the country from representatives of the International Office of Migration, an independent body supported by governments. Diane Grammer, head of the IOM office in London, said each of those who left was given the option of staying in interviews. Three changed their minds and decided to seek asylum.

      "body": "<p>The government lost almost half the ground it had gained on hospital waiting lists when queues soared more than 36,000 last December, official figures yesterday showed. </p> <p>The increase in hospital queues in December means that Labour is now again 60,000 short of its general election promise to cut the total for England by 100,000. </p> <p>Ministers remain confident of regaining the ground over the next 12 months, in time for a possible spring 2001 election. But critics are accusing them of being the victims of their own rhetoric. </p> <p>Liam Fox, Conservative shadow health secretary, said: \"We warned the government that their obsession with the waiting list initiative and running the system with no slack for common and predictable occurrences, such as winter flu, would have major ramifications for the health service.\" </p> <p>The figures for December 31 showed that the total list grew 36,600 that month to 1,108,000. The number of people waiting more than a year grew even more to 51,000. </p> <p>As many as 101 patients had been waiting more than 18 months for treatment in breach of the guarantee in the patient's charter, compared to 69 at the end of November. </p> <p>The department of health said the increase was to be expected. Many hospitals started to cancel routine surgery in the second half of December in preparation for possible problems over the millennium holiday period. </p> <p>The government's difficulty was that plans to resume surgery sessions in January were knocked off course by the flu outbreak that filled wards with emergency admissions. </p> <p>There was better news for ministers in quarterly figures for out-patient waits, the main indicator of which fell in the three months to December 31 for the first time in three years. People waiting more than 13 weeks to see a specialist dropped 16,000 to 496,000. </p> <p>However, people waiting more than 26 weeks rose 10,000 in the quarter to 159,000.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The government lost almost half the ground it had gained on hospital waiting lists when queues soared more than 36,000 last December, official figures yesterday showed. The increase in hospital queues in December means that Labour is now again 60,000 short of its general election promise to cut the total for England by 100,000. Ministers remain confident of regaining the ground over the next 12 months, in time for a possible spring 2001 election. But critics are accusing them of being the victims of their own rhetoric. Liam Fox, Conservative shadow health secretary, said: \"We warned the government that their obsession with the waiting list initiative and running the system with no slack for common and predictable occurrences, such as winter flu, would have major ramifications for the health service.\" The figures for December 31 showed that the total list grew 36,600 that month to 1,108,000. The number of people waiting more than a year grew even more to 51,000. As many as 101 patients had been waiting more than 18 months for treatment in breach of the guarantee in the patient's charter, compared to 69 at the end of November. The department of health said the increase was to be expected. Many hospitals started to cancel routine surgery in the second half of December in preparation for possible problems over the millennium holiday period. The government's difficulty was that plans to resume surgery sessions in January were knocked off course by the flu outbreak that filled wards with emergency admissions. There was better news for ministers in quarterly figures for out-patient waits, the main indicator of which fell in the three months to December 31 for the first time in three years. People waiting more than 13 weeks to see a specialist dropped 16,000 to 496,000. However, people waiting more than 26 weeks rose 10,000 in the quarter to 159,000.",

The move is set to aggravate US relations with India and anger human rights campaigners who claim a visit will legitimise last October's Pakistani military coup. Officially, the White House is still considering whether to add a Pakistan visit to Mr Clinton's India and Bangladesh trip, due to start on March 20. However, a senior Clinton administration official said privately this week that a visit to Pakistan is now \"likely to take place\" as part of the first US presidential tour of the subcontinent since Jimmy Carter's 1978 visit. A Clinton decision to visit Pakistan would deal a blow to New Delhi, which wants Washington to declare Pakistan a rogue state over its alleged role in December's hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet to Afghanistan. The Pentagon has taken the lead in pressing Mr Clinton to talk with Pakistan's new military ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, but the state department, initially cautious, is now believed to accept that a visit would be in the best interests of the US in the region. Pakistan's eagerness for the visit was underlined yesterday, when General Ghulam Ahmed, head of the intelligence service (ISI), repeatedly accused by India of masterminding the long-running conflict over Kashmir and the aircraft hijacking, gave a rare interview to the Washington Post. Gen Ahmed said the ISI is focussing on internal not external issues and he shared US fears about regional terrorism. Mr Clinton originally hoped to make a keynote tour to India and Pakistan in 1998 and 1999. Those plans collapsed, partly because of the Monica Lewinsky affair and Mr Clinton's impeachment, but also because India and Pakistan began nuclear testing.",

Last night brought a similar moment of dread: the IRA announced its withdrawal from the disarmament talks on which the entire peace process now hangs. The heart began to sink. Could it be that Northern Ireland, having come so close to a peaceful future, was about to return to the bloody past of bombs, shootings and death?</p> <p>No, thankfully, it seemed not. The interpreters who routinely fan out to decode statements from the IRA provided rapid reassurance - in time for the Six O'Clock News: there was, they said, no threat to the ceasefire. The provisionals were not returning to war; instead they were pulling out in disgust from the process that is meant to secure peace. As one senior republican put it, the IRA's latest action is a \"controlled upping of the ante\". They want the Ulster Unionists and the British government to realise how bad things have got.</p> <p>What explains this crisis? After all, little more than two months have passed since we all witnessed the once-unimaginable: Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Bruin taking their seats as Sinn Fein ministers in a new Northern Ireland executive - sharing a cabinet table with their blood-enemies in Unionism. Just a few days ago John de Chastelain, the Canadian former general charged with overseeing the disarmament process, stepped forward to deliver his first truly upbeat report - anticipating, at last, a process of IRA decommissioning. So what went wrong?</p> <p>The answer, sad to say, may lie with one man: Peter Mandelson. The republican movement is in a state of cold fury with the secretary of state, accusing him of dishonesty and unforgiveable bias - acting not as an honest broker but as an agent for unionism. Relations have not broken down. Nor have they reached the nadir plumbed by Mr Mandelson's predecessor, Mo Mowlam, in her relationship with the unionists. The distrust is not yet that bad. But, says one Sinn Fein activist, \"It's getting there.\"</p> <p>At the heart of the problem are the events of last Friday. On that day Mandelson announced the suspension of the fledgling Northern Ireland executive. From now on the province would be governed by him alone: a return to the direct rule of the last quarter century. He had no alternative, he said. If he had allowed the executive to survive, the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble would have faced his party's ruling council the next day and been forced to resign. After all, Trimble had only persuaded the UUP's hardliners to allow the executive on a promise that, if the IRA did not hand over their guns by February 12, he would quit as first minister and bring the whole body tumbling down. In the absence of any movement from the IRA, Mandelson says the only way he could save Trimble - and therefore the executive itself - was to suspend it.</p> <p>It is that decision which has so enraged Sinn Fein. For they believe the IRA had indeed moved - and moved an enormous distance. Admittedly it was at the last minute, late on Friday afternoon, but there is nothing unusual in that - not in a process which saw the Good Friday agreement negotiated at five o'clock in the morning. The IRA's shift was certainly significant enough to put a rare spring in General de Chastelain's step, after hours of intensive work. Dublin and Washington regarded it as a huge breakthrough, too. For what was in the pipeline was a statement declaring an end to the war, a promise for a symbolic yielding of arms before the May deadline agreed on Good Friday and even a possible timetable for decommissioning, dependent on an equivalent move toward demilitarisation by the British government. The critical element for the provos was a national day of reconciliation, one in which they could be seen not as a defeated force but as an army \"standing down\" along with the British.</p> <p>With all that in the air, it's easy to understand republican fury. Why on earth would Peter Mandelson have passed up this chance, just to stick to a deadline laid down by the Ulster Unionist Council? For Sinn Fein's president, Gerry Adams, it made life particularly difficult. At the end of last year he faced a grilling from republican hardliners who doubted Mandelson's bona fides. They feared the secretary of state had issued wavering unionists with a personal assurance that he would collapse the executive if the IRA gave up no guns, no matter what the Good Friday text said. When they heard Mandelson on the radio, explaining why unionist patience had finally snapped, they felt their worst fears had been confirmed - that they were dealing not with a British cabinet minister but a spokesman for the UUP.</p> <p>Their fury was stoked yet further by their belief that Mandelson is massaging the truth. He insists that he had no idea what was in the IRA statement when he ordered the suspension on Friday night. Sinn Fein say that is absolutely untrue. As secretary of state, he is kept informed of every step of these ultra-delicate negotiations. They are convinced that he sacrificed a real chance for peace last week - in order to stick to his bargain with David Trimble.</p> <p>That may be a conspiracy theory too far, but Peter Mandelson does indeed seem to have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. His error has been to give the distinct impression - so fatal in a Northern Ireland secretary - that the ultimate veto remains in unionist hands: if events don't run on their timetable, they don't run at all. He has not paused to imagine what his actions on Friday night looked like to nationalist and republican eyes. For they seemed to confirm the hardliners' constant complaint: that no matter how much you bend over backwards, no matter how much you negotiate, it will never be good enough. Adams and McGuinness have spent years arguing with their fellow republicans that politics is worthwhile, that gaining a power-sharing executive was worth trading, say, articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution, which maintained a claim on the north and which have now been dropped. Then, on Friday, a British minister removes the executive with a stroke of a pen just because the unionists insist he must.</p> <p>No wonder the hardliners are walking away. Peter Mandelson has succeeded in making the moderates in republicanism look like saps and the extremists like sages. He needs to move quickly to turn that around - for a peace process that remains deadlocked for too long can fast become a war.</p>",

As one senior republican put it, the IRA's latest action is a \"controlled upping of the ante\". They want the Ulster Unionists and the British government to realise how bad things have got. What explains this crisis? After all, little more than two months have passed since we all witnessed the once-unimaginable: Martin McGuinness and Bairbre de Bruin taking their seats as Sinn Fein ministers in a new Northern Ireland executive - sharing a cabinet table with their blood-enemies in Unionism. Just a few days ago John de Chastelain, the Canadian former general charged with overseeing the disarmament process, stepped forward to deliver his first truly upbeat report - anticipating, at last, a process of IRA decommissioning. So what went wrong? The answer, sad to say, may lie with one man: Peter Mandelson. The republican movement is in a state of cold fury with the secretary of state, accusing him of dishonesty and unforgiveable bias - acting not as an honest broker but as an agent for unionism. Relations have not broken down. Nor have they reached the nadir plumbed by Mr Mandelson's predecessor, Mo Mowlam, in her relationship with the unionists. The distrust is not yet that bad. But, says one Sinn Fein activist, \"It's getting there.\" At the heart of the problem are the events of last Friday. On that day Mandelson announced the suspension of the fledgling Northern Ireland executive. From now on the province would be governed by him alone: a return to the direct rule of the last quarter century. He had no alternative, he said. If he had allowed the executive to survive, the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble would have faced his party's ruling council the next day and been forced to resign. After all, Trimble had only persuaded the UUP's hardliners to allow the executive on a promise that, if the IRA did not hand over their guns by February 12, he would quit as first minister and bring the whole body tumbling down. In the absence of any movement from the IRA, Mandelson says the only way he could save Trimble - and therefore the executive itself - was to suspend it. It is that decision which has so enraged Sinn Fein. For they believe the IRA had indeed moved - and moved an enormous distance. Admittedly it was at the last minute, late on Friday afternoon, but there is nothing unusual in that - not in a process which saw the Good Friday agreement negotiated at five o'clock in the morning. The IRA's shift was certainly significant enough to put a rare spring in General de Chastelain's step, after hours of intensive work. Dublin and Washington regarded it as a huge breakthrough, too. For what was in the pipeline was a statement declaring an end to the war, a promise for a symbolic yielding of arms before the May deadline agreed on Good Friday and even a possible timetable for decommissioning, dependent on an equivalent move toward demilitarisation by the British government. The critical element for the provos was a national day of reconciliation, one in which they could be seen not as a defeated force but as an army \"standing down\" along with the British. With all that in the air, it's easy to understand republican fury. Why on earth would Peter Mandelson have passed up this chance, just to stick to a deadline laid down by the Ulster Unionist Council? For Sinn Fein's president, Gerry Adams, it made life particularly difficult. At the end of last year he faced a grilling from republican hardliners who doubted Mandelson's bona fides. They feared the secretary of state had issued wavering unionists with a personal assurance that he would collapse the executive if the IRA gave up no guns, no matter what the Good Friday text said. When they heard Mandelson on the radio, explaining why unionist patience had finally snapped, they felt their worst fears had been confirmed - that they were dealing not with a British cabinet minister but a spokesman for the UUP. Their fury was stoked yet further by their belief that Mandelson is massaging the truth. He insists that he had no idea what was in the IRA statement when he ordered the suspension on Friday night. Sinn Fein say that is absolutely untrue. As secretary of state, he is kept informed of every step of these ultra-delicate negotiations. They are convinced that he sacrificed a real chance for peace last week - in order to stick to his bargain with David Trimble. That may be a conspiracy theory too far, but Peter Mandelson does indeed seem to have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory. His error has been to give the distinct impression - so fatal in a Northern Ireland secretary - that the ultimate veto remains in unionist hands: if events don't run on their timetable, they don't run at all. He has not paused to imagine what his actions on Friday night looked like to nationalist and republican eyes. For they seemed to confirm the hardliners' constant complaint: that no matter how much you bend over backwards, no matter how much you negotiate, it will never be good enough. Adams and McGuinness have spent years arguing with their fellow republicans that politics is worthwhile, that gaining a power-sharing executive was worth trading, say, articles 2 and 3 of the Irish constitution, which maintained a claim on the north and which have now been dropped. Then, on Friday, a British minister removes the executive with a stroke of a pen just because the unionists insist he must. No wonder the hardliners are walking away. Peter Mandelson has succeeded in making the moderates in republicanism look like saps and the extremists like sages. He needs to move quickly to turn that around - for a peace process that remains deadlocked for too long can fast become a war.",

      "body": "<p>There was a familiar pattern to the start of the scandal: a whistleblower who was not only not believed, but suspended and later sacked. Neither internal nor police inquiries were able to stand up her allegations.</p> <p>It ended yesterday, 14 years later, after a four-year long judicial inquiry, the longest and most expensive investigation into childcare in Britain. The 500,000-word Waterhouse report paints a chilling picture of life in North Wales's children's homes over 25 years. The initial complaint involved physical abuse in a single Gwynedd home. That expanded into an investigation into more than 40 homes - public, private and voluntary - in Clwyd and Gwynedd which found not only blatant physical bullying but gross sexual, emotional and mental abuse too.</p> <p>Yet again, a system designed to protect children from abusive parents or relatives stands indicted for inflicting abuse as bad or worse on the children under its protection. Most cases go back to the 1970s or early 1980s, but a few stretch into the 1990s. In far too many homes in North Wales there was an absence of compassion, care or concern for children and \"a conspiracy of silence\" among the staff. As Paul Murphy, Welsh secretary, told the Commons, there were \"appalling misdeeds, wickedness and total abuse of trust\". The system was devoid of leadership, management or planning.

      "bodyText": "There was a familiar pattern to the start of the scandal: a whistleblower who was not only not believed, but suspended and later sacked. Neither internal nor police inquiries were able to stand up her allegations. It ended yesterday, 14 years later, after a four-year long judicial inquiry, the longest and most expensive investigation into childcare in Britain. The 500,000-word Waterhouse report paints a chilling picture of life in North Wales's children's homes over 25 years. The initial complaint involved physical abuse in a single Gwynedd home. That expanded into an investigation into more than 40 homes - public, private and voluntary - in Clwyd and Gwynedd which found not only blatant physical bullying but gross sexual, emotional and mental abuse too. Yet again, a system designed to protect children from abusive parents or relatives stands indicted for inflicting abuse as bad or worse on the children under its protection. Most cases go back to the 1970s or early 1980s, but a few stretch into the 1990s. In far too many homes in North Wales there was an absence of compassion, care or concern for children and \"a conspiracy of silence\" among the staff. As Paul Murphy, Welsh secretary, told the Commons, there were \"appalling misdeeds, wickedness and total abuse of trust\". The system was devoid of leadership, management or planning. No part of it escapes censure - social services, councillors, police, or the Welsh office. There has been a succession of internal, external and independent investigations into North Wales homes. High-profile criminal trials of key abusers have kept the scandal in the news. Yet there was much we still did not know - and a lot of rumour which needed scotching. Of the 12 internal inquiries into Clwyd, only two were relayed to councillors in comprehensive form. In Waterhouse's words, some accounts were \"positively misleading\". Yet it seems that no official has been disciplined. Then there was the 254-page Jillings report, an independent investigation which was withheld from publication by Clwyd partly because of the demands of its insurers.

      "bodyText": "Six countries from the Baltic to the Mediterranean pledged to abide by the rules and values of the European Union yesterday at the launch of talks that will almost double its membership within a decade. Ministers from Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania and Malta all hailed the \"historic\" nature of their engagement with the 15-member club, now in the throes of the biggest expansion in its history. This second wave of enlargement follows talks under way with fast-track candidates Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus. If all join, plus Turkey, the EU would one day comprise 28 countries with more than 500m citizens, which would make it the largest trading and investment bloc in the world. The EU says the first newcomers can be admitted after 2003 though entry will be staggered, according to how quickly the candidates meet the many criteria they have to fulfil. The scale of the expansion is acting as a spur to urgent institutional reforms by the existing members - launched in Brussels on Monday - that are needed to avoid paralysis when the club grows. \"After being for almost half a century on the bad side of history ... this historic moment means that Romania is now on the right side,\" the Romanian foreign minister, Petre Roman, said. In Bucharest, an EU flag was symbolically placed on a pedestal where a bronze replica of Lenin stood until a decade ago. Joseph Borg, the Maltese foreign minister, compared the significance of the occasion with the island's independence from Britain in 1964. There have been six waves of enlargement since the European Economic Community was founded in 1957. The last step involved the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden in 1995. But the entry of the former communist countries of eastern Europe poses far bigger challenges. The current crisis over Austria also poses awkward questions, as the country's far-right Freedom party exploits fears of an influx of immigrants and a loss of jobs as investors move to its low-wage neighbours. All 12 candidates face the huge task of adapting their legislation to EU rules, and respecting the union's basic principles of human rights, democracy and market economics. Negotiations must tackle complex technical issues, including agricultural and industrial subsidies, anti-trust law and environmental standards - an issue highlighted by the cyanide spill that has devastated fishing in Hungary in recent days. Turkey was also recognised as a candidate at last December's Helsinki summit, while Croatia, Macedonia, Albania and Bosnia have expressed long-term hopes of joining. Wide support exists for enlargement, though there are fears - expressed recently by the former commission president, Jacques Delors - that if the process moves too fast the EU's original values will be diluted or lost.

The anti-McCain onslaught is rising to a peak as the two men slug it out in the South Carolina Republican primary, where voters vote on Saturday in a contest that both candidates have to win. Mr Bush's lurch to the right in a state where white religious conservatives hold political sway seems to be paying dividends, according to the opinion polls. A new Gallup poll taken between Friday and Sunday shows Mr Bush with a 49%-42% lead over Mr McCain. This is Mr Bush's best poll showing since Mr McCain trounced the Texas governor in the New Hampshire primary two weeks ago. Mr Bush has a 59%-34% lead among registered Republicans, while Mr McCain has a 54%-36% advantage among independents, who are allowed to vote on Saturday. Mr Bush's tactics included the launch of 100,000 taped telephone calls to Republican voters from the iconic conservative Republican Congressman Henry Hyde, who led the impeachment drive against President Bill Clinton and is best known as a militant opponent of abortion rights. Mr Hyde praises Mr Bush's \"strong pro-life record in Texas\" and criticises suggestions \"that changes be made to the party platform on the life issue\".

Mr Bush's mobilisation of the conservative right includes a mass mailing by the National Right to Life Committee which claims that Mr McCain \"voted repeatedly to use tax dollars for experiments that use body parts from aborted babies\". The mailing carries the picture of a baby with the message: \"This little guy wants you to vote for George Bush.\" The National Smokers Alliance (NSA) - founded by the tobacco giant Philip Morris - will today launch a series of radio adverts in South Carolina accusing Mr McCain of campaigning to raise cigarette prices and ending: \"If straight talk is the issue, John McCain isn't the answer.\" The NSA has already spent at least $250,000 (\u00a3156,000) on anti-McCain television advertising in South Carolina. The final days of the campaign have been marked by the intervention of influential rightwing public figures such as the broadcaster Rush Limbaugh and the religious conservative Pat Robertson. Mr Limbaugh said on his radio show this week that Mr Bush should launch a commercial in which \"people with Clinton-Gore buttons and T-shirts with liberal slogans on them\" would talk to one another saying \"That McCain sounds like one of us\".

      "bodyText": "Drive-in movies for shoppers The Asda supermarket chain yesterday announced plans to screen drive-in movies at the car parks of its stores. The American-style shows are to be launched in York next month, with plans to screen films at 25 stores in April and May and a further 25 by September. Asda, recently bought out by American retail giant Wal-Mart, believes the idea will prove a huge hit with customers, with refreshments provided by an Asda \"snack-shack\". An Asda spokeswoman said: \"We will show family films, broadcast on a large screen. \"Customers can either listen to the movies on their car radios, or sit in the tiered seating area which will be assembled in each car park. \"The films will be shown in the early evening, so customers could either make a special journey to see a film, or combine it with a visit to do with the shopping.\" Family may sue over blood error The family of a woman who died when she was given the wrong type of blood during brain surgery threatened yesterday to take legal action against the hospital. Hilary Pearce, 62, died minutes after being given a blood transfusion by operating theatre staff at Addenbrooke's hospital in Cambridge during surgery for a burst blood vessel in her brain last November. She received half a litre of A positive blood, instead of O positive, which caused irreversible blood clotting. The grandmother from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, died of a heart attack. The hospital, which could face a huge payout to Mrs Pearce's family, will be investigated by the health and safety executive. Police are awaiting the outcome of an inquest before considering any criminal charges. Three staff were suspended during a hospital inquiry, the results of which have been passed to the woman's husband and two children. Two of the staff have returned to work and the third has since returned to the Norfolk and Norwich hospital.

Ian Black MPs want corporate killing law The government was under growing pressure last night to create a new offence of corporate killing after a court of appeal ruling confirmed that the law made it virtually impossible to bring large companies to book for mass disasters. Three judges yesterday upheld a ruling by the high court last July that Great Western Trains, the company at the centre of the Southall train crash, could not be prosecuted for manslaughter because a conviction would be impossible. The ruling came as MPs urged the government to reform the law. The parliamentary select committee on environment, transport and regional affairs said in a report yesterday: \"We recommend that the government brings forward legislation to introduce a crime of corporate killing as soon as possible.\" Clare Dyer Quids in Lighthouse going for a pound Unique lighthouse, cast iron, stunning setting on rocky outcrop off south Wales coast, approachable only for few hours every day - yours for \u00a31.

      "body": "<p>A homeless solvent abuser was yesterday jailed for life at Stafford crown court after pleading guilty to the murder of a Catholic priest who befriended him and offered him shelter.</p> <p>Father Paul Orchard, 80, was stabbed to death on the steps of the presbytery of the Church of Our Lady and St Hubert in Brandhall, near Birmingham, by Mark Massey, 33, who had a history of violent crime related to his use of solvents, which began when he was 14.</p> <p>Massey had sniffed glue on the day he stabbed Fr Orchard in September, 1998. In mitigation, Michael Birnbaum QC, said that at the time Massey had been suffering \"psychotic delusions, thinking he was the devil\".</p> <p>\"All he remembers of the offence was a flash of lightning and a pool of blood. One can only speculate what was in his mind but it must have been irrational.\"</p> <p>Fr Orchard, a former Benedictine monk, operated an open-door policy at the church and was known for his work with the homeless. He first came into contact with Massey in 1995, and over three years provided him with help and support.</p> <p>Mr Birnbaum said it was a tragic irony that Massey had killed the person who \"perhaps, above all others, had on many occasions helped him and given him food and shelter\".</p> <p>On the day of the murder Massey was found sheltering in the church by a group of women preparing for the the harvest festival. The women called Fr Orchard, who reassured them that Massey did not present a danger as he had not been drinking.</p> <p>Fr Orchard took him into his study, and after making him sandwiches and tea rang two Catholic shelters for the homeless, both of which were full. Sometime later, after sniffing glue in the toilet and telephoning his grandmother from the presbytery, Massey stabbed Fr Orchard repeatedly in the neck and heart. The body was found the following morning by parishioners.</p> <p>After killing Fr Orchard Massey went to hospital to have a cut on his hand treated, and told a policeman: \"I think I have done a terrible thing. I am a glue sniffer and I have killed a priest. I keep having flashbacks.\"</p> <p>Mr Birnbaum said: \"There is no rational motive. It happened, in a nutshell, because of the glue addiction. Massey started glue sniffing when he was 14. Most people get over this after adolescence but he continued to sniff glue into his adult life as an escape from his problems.\"</p> <p>Mr Justice Kay said: \"Leslie Paul Orchard was by all accounts a thoroughly good man who devoted his life to the service of others.</p> <p>\"He spent many years as a Roman Catholic priest. At 80 he didn't seek the retirement he should have had but went on with his life's work. One of those he sought to look after was you,\" he told Massey.</p> <p>\"He must have known there was an element of danger in this. But he shirked this. You rewarded him for several years of assisting and helping you by taking his life in a brutal and savage fashion.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Birmingham said: \"Fr Orchard was a much loved pastor to the people of St Hubert's.

      "bodyText": "A homeless solvent abuser was yesterday jailed for life at Stafford crown court after pleading guilty to the murder of a Catholic priest who befriended him and offered him shelter. Father Paul Orchard, 80, was stabbed to death on the steps of the presbytery of the Church of Our Lady and St Hubert in Brandhall, near Birmingham, by Mark Massey, 33, who had a history of violent crime related to his use of solvents, which began when he was 14. Massey had sniffed glue on the day he stabbed Fr Orchard in September, 1998. In mitigation, Michael Birnbaum QC, said that at the time Massey had been suffering \"psychotic delusions, thinking he was the devil\". \"All he remembers of the offence was a flash of lightning and a pool of blood. One can only speculate what was in his mind but it must have been irrational.\" Fr Orchard, a former Benedictine monk, operated an open-door policy at the church and was known for his work with the homeless. He first came into contact with Massey in 1995, and over three years provided him with help and support. Mr Birnbaum said it was a tragic irony that Massey had killed the person who \"perhaps, above all others, had on many occasions helped him and given him food and shelter\". On the day of the murder Massey was found sheltering in the church by a group of women preparing for the the harvest festival. The women called Fr Orchard, who reassured them that Massey did not present a danger as he had not been drinking. Fr Orchard took him into his study, and after making him sandwiches and tea rang two Catholic shelters for the homeless, both of which were full. Sometime later, after sniffing glue in the toilet and telephoning his grandmother from the presbytery, Massey stabbed Fr Orchard repeatedly in the neck and heart. The body was found the following morning by parishioners. After killing Fr Orchard Massey went to hospital to have a cut on his hand treated, and told a policeman: \"I think I have done a terrible thing. I am a glue sniffer and I have killed a priest. I keep having flashbacks.\" Mr Birnbaum said: \"There is no rational motive. It happened, in a nutshell, because of the glue addiction. Massey started glue sniffing when he was 14. Most people get over this after adolescence but he continued to sniff glue into his adult life as an escape from his problems.\" Mr Justice Kay said: \"Leslie Paul Orchard was by all accounts a thoroughly good man who devoted his life to the service of others. \"He spent many years as a Roman Catholic priest. At 80 he didn't seek the retirement he should have had but went on with his life's work. One of those he sought to look after was you,\" he told Massey. \"He must have known there was an element of danger in this. But he shirked this. You rewarded him for several years of assisting and helping you by taking his life in a brutal and savage fashion.\" A spokesman for the Roman Catholic archdiocese of Birmingham said: \"Fr Orchard was a much loved pastor to the people of St Hubert's. In a spirit of Christian hospitality he made himself available to anyone and everyone who called at his door. \"It is a sad reflection of inner city life that such generosity was the occasion of his violent death.\"",

      "body": "<p>Three Britons were among seven climbers killed in an avalanche on a notoriously difficult Russian mountain, it emerged yesterday.</p> <p>The three men - together with four Russians - were 700 metres from the peak of the 4,700 metre Ushba mountain in the Elbrus range, when an ice fall triggered the snowslide which killed all seven.</p> <p>The tragedy - early last Thursday - occurred as they rested on a plateau which they had been warned was dangerous but from which they were too exhausted to move.</p> <p>Last night, a team of 70 rescuers, assisted by helicopters, was forced to call off the search, due to worsening weather .</p> <p>The threat of a second potentially lethal ice fall, together with heavy snow and strong wind, has already hampered the rescue operation - but the Russian emergency services hope to continue trying to recover the bodies today.</p> <p>Until that time, the families of three Britons who are believed to be missing in the area will have to wait for confirmation of the deaths. The only clue to the Britons' identities came from a metal tag on a rucksack, which bore the name of a man from London. But the foreign office refused to confirm any names. It emerged that the climbers, who set off in fine conditions, had completed their first arduous day of the climb when they decided to stop on the plateau. A second group of climbers who had made it to the summit tried to deter them from doing so because of the risk of avalanches.</p> <p>But, according to the second group, the three Britons - none of whom had registered with the emergency authorities as required - were too exhausted to scale one of two ice-covered peaks to safety.</p> <p>During the night, the second group heard an avalanche. The following morning they saw the plateau had been covered with ice and began the descent to inform the rescue services, arriving back at their base on Friday morning.</p> <p>The Russians were members of a climbing club in Pyatigorsk, southern Russia, and mountaineering experts suggested the Britons would also have been highly experienced.</p> <p>The arduous route they had chosen - the most difficult by Russian standards - and their decision to climb in February instead of the summer, suggested they were experts. \"We're talking about a serious mountain expedition. It's not straightforward like Everest. Even the easier routes on it are demanding - and it's certainly not something Britons would normally attempt in the winter,\" said the climber and editor of Alpine Journal, Ed Douglas.</p> <p>\"It's a world class mountain and it's not one that list-tickers on an ego trip would go for: it's too difficult,\" said John Temple, a mountaineer who nearly died as he scaled its southern peak four years ago.</p> <p>\"It's like two Matterhorns stuck back to back - but unlike the Matterhorn, where you can walk up to the face, you have to climb up even the easier approaches.\"</p> <p>\"It's long and high and there simply isn't an easy way up. People are regularly killed on it - and in winter, with the wind coming from Siberia and temperatures of minus 20, I would think it must be hell on earth.\"</p> <p>But Russian mountaineers - notorious for their macho refusal to stop climbing throughout the winter - insisted that climbing in the Caucasus, in the Kabardino-Balkaria region of Russia on the Georgian border, held great appeal for experienced climbers. \"In this part of the Caucasus you're unlikely to come across other climbers,\" said Gennady Starikov, of the Russian Federation of Mountain Climbers.</p> <p>\"When you set out in the morning there are no footprints but your own - no trace of anyone else; it's an incredible sensation.\" Gia Ksnelanshvili, of the geographic bureau in St Petersburg, who organises climbs in the region added: \"The Caucasus doesn't have the infrastructure of the alps - there aren't the same comfortable hotels and lifts - but for genuine mountaineering enthusiasts this is precisely the attraction. People come here when they want to find out about real mountains.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Three Britons were among seven climbers killed in an avalanche on a notoriously difficult Russian mountain, it emerged yesterday. The three men - together with four Russians - were 700 metres from the peak of the 4,700 metre Ushba mountain in the Elbrus range, when an ice fall triggered the snowslide which killed all seven. The tragedy - early last Thursday - occurred as they rested on a plateau which they had been warned was dangerous but from which they were too exhausted to move. Last night, a team of 70 rescuers, assisted by helicopters, was forced to call off the search, due to worsening weather . The threat of a second potentially lethal ice fall, together with heavy snow and strong wind, has already hampered the rescue operation - but the Russian emergency services hope to continue trying to recover the bodies today. Until that time, the families of three Britons who are believed to be missing in the area will have to wait for confirmation of the deaths. The only clue to the Britons' identities came from a metal tag on a rucksack, which bore the name of a man from London. But the foreign office refused to confirm any names. It emerged that the climbers, who set off in fine conditions, had completed their first arduous day of the climb when they decided to stop on the plateau. A second group of climbers who had made it to the summit tried to deter them from doing so because of the risk of avalanches. But, according to the second group, the three Britons - none of whom had registered with the emergency authorities as required - were too exhausted to scale one of two ice-covered peaks to safety. During the night, the second group heard an avalanche. The following morning they saw the plateau had been covered with ice and began the descent to inform the rescue services, arriving back at their base on Friday morning. The Russians were members of a climbing club in Pyatigorsk, southern Russia, and mountaineering experts suggested the Britons would also have been highly experienced. The arduous route they had chosen - the most difficult by Russian standards - and their decision to climb in February instead of the summer, suggested they were experts. \"We're talking about a serious mountain expedition. It's not straightforward like Everest. Even the easier routes on it are demanding - and it's certainly not something Britons would normally attempt in the winter,\" said the climber and editor of Alpine Journal, Ed Douglas. \"It's a world class mountain and it's not one that list-tickers on an ego trip would go for: it's too difficult,\" said John Temple, a mountaineer who nearly died as he scaled its southern peak four years ago. \"It's like two Matterhorns stuck back to back - but unlike the Matterhorn, where you can walk up to the face, you have to climb up even the easier approaches.\" \"It's long and high and there simply isn't an easy way up. People are regularly killed on it - and in winter, with the wind coming from Siberia and temperatures of minus 20, I would think it must be hell on earth.\" But Russian mountaineers - notorious for their macho refusal to stop climbing throughout the winter - insisted that climbing in the Caucasus, in the Kabardino-Balkaria region of Russia on the Georgian border, held great appeal for experienced climbers. \"In this part of the Caucasus you're unlikely to come across other climbers,\" said Gennady Starikov, of the Russian Federation of Mountain Climbers. \"When you set out in the morning there are no footprints but your own - no trace of anyone else; it's an incredible sensation.\" Gia Ksnelanshvili, of the geographic bureau in St Petersburg, who organises climbs in the region added: \"The Caucasus doesn't have the infrastructure of the alps - there aren't the same comfortable hotels and lifts - but for genuine mountaineering enthusiasts this is precisely the attraction. People come here when they want to find out about real mountains.\"",

In an uncompromising statement, the IRA said it was withdrawing all the commitments it had given to the independent international commission on decommissioning since appointing its linkman in November. That included its late initiative on Friday which Gen de Chastelain believed had offered the prospect of a deal.

      "body": "<p>John Prescott is gearing up for the most important decision he might have to make as secretary of state for environment, transport and the regions. Rarely has an issue covered almost every aspect of his unwieldy empire: country towns bursting at the seams, roads permanently clogged up and builders threatening to carpet more greenfields with concrete and brick.</p> <p>While tackling the country's crumbling railway infrastructure might have been foremost in his mind until Lord Macdonald began shouldering much of the transport brief, the deputy prime minister knows development of the south-east - marginal middle-England, no less - could have far graver political consequences.</p> <p>That's why No 10, and a key cabinet committee, has been mulling over housing projections and population forecasts for the ever-prospering region - England's wealthiest - as countryside campaigners and amenity groups flood local papers with protest letters, or take to the streets. The home counties, it seems, are in revolt - partly because the issue has been so misrepresented.</p> <p>Prescott's dilemma is how to balance rising demand for new homes, often from key workers such as nurses and teachers - and, increasingly, single people - with protecting the countryside and, crucially, meeting a target of putting up to 60% of new homes on recycled, or \"brownfield\" land. The issue came to a head at a new style of planning inquiry in London last year. Two government inspectors \"tested\" proposals from a planning consortium of local councils, known as Serplan, for a maximum of 914,000 homes in the 12 counties outside London up to 2016. Even this number, the planners conceded, would probably require a string of new townships and certainly a big expansion of Milton Keynes, in Buckinghamshire, to contain further greenfield building. Any more would require \"difficult environmental choices\", warned Chris Williams, chairman of Serplan's strategy group.</p> <p>Yet that's what the inspectors recommended to John Prescott last October: 1.1m homes, with new developments of 80,000-100,000 homes around Crawley in Sussex, Ashford in Kent, Stansted in Essex and Milton Keynes. Because they suggested building over a shorter timescale, the Council for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE) calculated this represented a 64% increase on Serplan's proposals, or 430,000 homes. It provoked a storm of protest, which has rarely subsided, and a string of lurid headlines - and cheap political gestures from the opposition - bearing little relation to reality.</p> <p>Largely because of this uproar, the 1.1m figure became written in stone. It was portrayed as Prescott's plan, not as a recommendation which he could either accept, or reject. In fact, after intense discussions between Downing Street and his super-ministry, the deputy prime minister will steer a sensible, middle course, rejecting the old-fashioned, rigid \"predict and provide\" approach to house building over long time frames in favour of a more flexible system looking no more than five years ahead - with regular, five-yearly reviews afterwards. He will opt for a big expansion of the Thames Gateway area, from Greenwich east to Dartford and Medway - where there is considerable \"brownfield\" land - and earmark Ashford as a major growth point, conveniently sited for the Channel tunnel.</p> <p>Nick Raynsford, his housing minister, has already signalled much tougher planning guidelines for local councils. Under these, developers will be subject to a series of rigorous, sequential tests. They will have to prove there is no brownfield land available in a particular area before being allowed to eye greenfield sites. Crucially, they will also have to radically improve the design and standards of new houses - generally regarded by the minister as \"tacky little boxes\" - and cram many more on to building sites. Raynsford says far too much land is wasted, further extending the urban sprawl.</p> <p>But Prescott has another problem, often conveniently forgotten by the countryside lobby. While tens of thousands annually leave the sluggish north for work in the booming south-east, much of the housing demand is generated from within the region. Consequently, over the next 25 years, around 850,000 additional households are expected - and not all of them will be in a position to buy. This raises a further dilemma: the desperate shortage of lower cost, rented accommodation for people on average incomes, including young professionals. With house prices already five times average earnings in the region, even senior Tory councillors privately recognise that many more \"social\" homes will be needed - perhaps 40% of planned provision - to cope with demand.</p> <p>As he prepares for a final decision, the deputy prime minister is also facing criticism from another quarter - the old planning lobby, which strongly backs the case for 1.1m new homes. It accuses Prescott of bowing to pressure from the countryside campaigners.

      "bodyText": "John Prescott is gearing up for the most important decision he might have to make as secretary of state for environment, transport and the regions. Rarely has an issue covered almost every aspect of his unwieldy empire: country towns bursting at the seams, roads permanently clogged up and builders threatening to carpet more greenfields with concrete and brick. While tackling the country's crumbling railway infrastructure might have been foremost in his mind until Lord Macdonald began shouldering much of the transport brief, the deputy prime minister knows development of the south-east - marginal middle-England, no less - could have far graver political consequences. That's why No 10, and a key cabinet committee, has been mulling over housing projections and population forecasts for the ever-prospering region - England's wealthiest - as countryside campaigners and amenity groups flood local papers with protest letters, or take to the streets. The home counties, it seems, are in revolt - partly because the issue has been so misrepresented. Prescott's dilemma is how to balance rising demand for new homes, often from key workers such as nurses and teachers - and, increasingly, single people - with protecting the countryside and, crucially, meeting a target of putting up to 60% of new homes on recycled, or \"brownfield\" land. The issue came to a head at a new style of planning inquiry in London last year. Two government inspectors \"tested\" proposals from a planning consortium of local councils, known as Serplan, for a maximum of 914,000 homes in the 12 counties outside London up to 2016. Even this number, the planners conceded, would probably require a string of new townships and certainly a big expansion of Milton Keynes, in Buckinghamshire, to contain further greenfield building. Any more would require \"difficult environmental choices\", warned Chris Williams, chairman of Serplan's strategy group. Yet that's what the inspectors recommended to John Prescott last October: 1.1m homes, with new developments of 80,000-100,000 homes around Crawley in Sussex, Ashford in Kent, Stansted in Essex and Milton Keynes. Because they suggested building over a shorter timescale, the Council for the Protection of Rural England (CPRE) calculated this represented a 64% increase on Serplan's proposals, or 430,000 homes. It provoked a storm of protest, which has rarely subsided, and a string of lurid headlines - and cheap political gestures from the opposition - bearing little relation to reality. Largely because of this uproar, the 1.1m figure became written in stone. It was portrayed as Prescott's plan, not as a recommendation which he could either accept, or reject. In fact, after intense discussions between Downing Street and his super-ministry, the deputy prime minister will steer a sensible, middle course, rejecting the old-fashioned, rigid \"predict and provide\" approach to house building over long time frames in favour of a more flexible system looking no more than five years ahead - with regular, five-yearly reviews afterwards. He will opt for a big expansion of the Thames Gateway area, from Greenwich east to Dartford and Medway - where there is considerable \"brownfield\" land - and earmark Ashford as a major growth point, conveniently sited for the Channel tunnel. Nick Raynsford, his housing minister, has already signalled much tougher planning guidelines for local councils. Under these, developers will be subject to a series of rigorous, sequential tests. They will have to prove there is no brownfield land available in a particular area before being allowed to eye greenfield sites. Crucially, they will also have to radically improve the design and standards of new houses - generally regarded by the minister as \"tacky little boxes\" - and cram many more on to building sites. Raynsford says far too much land is wasted, further extending the urban sprawl. But Prescott has another problem, often conveniently forgotten by the countryside lobby. While tens of thousands annually leave the sluggish north for work in the booming south-east, much of the housing demand is generated from within the region. Consequently, over the next 25 years, around 850,000 additional households are expected - and not all of them will be in a position to buy. This raises a further dilemma: the desperate shortage of lower cost, rented accommodation for people on average incomes, including young professionals. With house prices already five times average earnings in the region, even senior Tory councillors privately recognise that many more \"social\" homes will be needed - perhaps 40% of planned provision - to cope with demand. As he prepares for a final decision, the deputy prime minister is also facing criticism from another quarter - the old planning lobby, which strongly backs the case for 1.1m new homes. It accuses Prescott of bowing to pressure from the countryside campaigners. David Lock, vice chairman of the Town and Country Planning Association, accuses them of a \"campaign of deliberate misrepresentation and personal vilification [against Prescott's planning inspectors], which unleashed the bigotry of ignorant bullies...\" He fears that Prescott will be forced into a policy of \"town cramming\" because of impossibly high brownfield targets. At the other extreme, Prescott has to try to satisfy the architect Lord Rogers of Riverside, whose (government appointed) urban task force last year called for tough measures - a tax on greenfield building and tax brakes for urban development - to curb the rural drift and help the repopulation of cities. The normally mild-mannered architect, a friend of Mr Prescott, is becoming frustrated. This week he wrote that the government's reaction to his report had been \"disappointingly negative\". Unless England faced reality and placed more emphasis on reviving conurbations, he warned that the south-east would become even more congested, while northern cities would continue to suffer migration \"and the blight of decline\".",

      "bodyText": "MPs yesterday demanded a substantial rise in the number of customs staff to fight a \"rapidly worsening\" increase in alcohol and tobacco smuggling. A report by the all-party Commons treasury committee warned that legitimate businesses were going bust because violent criminals were moving into the trade. The report said that in Britain more than \u00a31.2bn worth of tax revenue was lost through tobacco and alcohol smuggling last year via the Channel ports alone. The committee warned that government revenues were being \"significantly undermined\" by smuggling and there were a range of wider effects on society. The report was published on the eve of the summoning of former Tory chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, now deputy chairman of cigarette giant British American Tobacco, to answer charges that the company exploited smuggling and turned a blind eye to black marketing. He will be accompanied today by his boss, Martin Broughton, who is being recalled for the third time to answer questions by the Commons health committee. The committee's decision follows the Guardian's revelations of how London-based BAT sold billions of packets a year expecting them to be smuggled. Mr Clarke, attempting to defend the world's second largest international tobacco firm, wrote in the Guardian: \"Where any government is unwilling to act or their efforts are unsuccessful, we act, completely within the law, on the basis that our brands will be available alongside those of our competitors in the smuggled as well as the legitimate market.\" MPs believe his statement contradicts assurances given at an earlier hearing by Mr Broughton, BAT's chairman, that it always cooperated with customs authorities to combat unlawful sales. It was suggested that these led to small firms such as newsagents, pubs and off-licences being put out of business, and to violent and organised crime becoming involved in smuggling, especially in the vicinity of the Channel ports. The problem was made worse, it was said, by children being encouraged to smoke and drink because of lower prices and easy availability. In the report published yesterday, the committee dismissed calls for duty rates on alcohol and tobacco to be cut to undermine the profit margins of smugglers. Attacking proposals that are now before Gordon Brown, the chancellor, from Martin Taylor, the Barclays Bank adviser and unofficial \"smuggling tsar\", the MPs rule out any budget changes to cut duty as a means of solving the problems. They said: \"Although it is not disputed that reducing excise duty rates would stop the notorious 'white van trade' in smuggled alcohol and tobacco, it is less clear that this course would affect large-scale smuggling, which appears to be the major problem.\" The MPs attack recent cuts in front-line customs staff and say the time has come for a big increase in funds to fight smuggling.\"We believe that far more should be done to keep smuggled goods out of the UK,\" they said. \"This will require significantly more resources for customs and excise, both for front-line staff at ports, and for inland and investigative staff.\" They call for more than another \u00a335m to be diverted to fight the smuggling rise, saying it is bound to be cost-effective. A new national network of X-ray machines should be installed to stop smuggling without delay, they say. The MPs attack the treasury for covering up a six-year-old report on the need for departmental reorganisation. MPs accuse customs of not being able to stand up the case against merger to public scrutiny. Dawn Primarolo, paymaster general, commented on the findings: \"This is a very thorough report and the government will respond in detail when we have carefully considered the committee's recommendations.\"",

Whatever the outcome, the contest has already changed the political landscape, exposing the limits of the changes Tony Blair has wrought to Labour and highlighting the tensions between the party system and the mayoral model the prime minister has championed. According to Labour's Millbank headquarters, the result cannot be declared until 5pm on Saturday at the earliest - and is more likely to come on Sunday or Monday - because a three-day breathing space was agreed to allow time for appeals and complaints from members and candidates. Ken Livingstone has called the gap \"an open invitation to fraud\" and Frank Dobson's spokeswoman describes the decision to invite appeals before the result is announced as \"unprecedented\". But Millbank is adamant there will be no outcome until all the candidates agree the process has been free and fair. That might take somewhat longer than three days, as Glenda Jackson has threatened to go to court at \"any hint of impropriety\" - the former transport minister is holding a \"moral victory\" party tonight - and Mr Livingstone is demanding a police guard on the ballot boxes at Unity Security Balloting, Labour's scrutineers. Whenever the official announcement, most Labour insiders assume that the winner, if not the precise result, will begin to leak out beforehand and that Downing Street will have a pretty clear idea of who it is by tonight. Even if Millbank's three-day delay holds, the results of most of the ballots in the union and other affiliates' third of the electoral college - important pointers to the wider voting pattern - are expected to be announced over the next couple of days, though they do not have to be in until Friday. The latest union ballot to be declared -though it will not count in the final tally because of late affiliation payment - was of Aslef tube train drivers, who it was announced yesterday had given Mr Livingstone 1,479 votes, Ms Jackson 96 and Mr Dobson just 60.

The likelihood is that neither will win an outright majority and the outcome will depend on the transfers from Ms Jackson's supporters. If the former Greater London council leader does, after all, triumph over a selection system designed to see him off, Mr Blair is on record as insisting he will back an official Labour Livingstone campaign. Despite the obloquy he and other Labour leaders have heaped on Mr Livingstone - and which would be enthusiastically recycled by Tories and Liberal Democrats during the mayoral election campaign - the prime minister has always left himself the alibi that if the Labour party picks the Brent East MP, that would show he has indeed changed. A Livingstone victory this week would immediately trigger an intense round of negotiations over his choice of deputy and mayoral manifesto, with the future of the government's plans for partial tube privatisation in the balance and Mr Livingstone playing a strong hand. Secret talks began last month with Lord Whitty, transport minister and former Labour general secretary, acting as go-between. Labour's leadership is particularly anxious to avoid a humiliating climbdown over the tube and strongly opposed to Mr Livingstone's proposal to parachute Ms Jackson into Labour's assembly top-up list and appoint her as his deputy.

In 1946, she had become principal of Sydney university's womens' college. Describing her role there as \"an administrator with an academic bias\", she encouraged students who came from all sorts of backgrounds - and from Europe and the United States. She played a similar role as headmistress of Abbotsleigh, the exclusive Sydney school for girls. The pupils, unusually for the time, were given sex education. She reformed the curriculum, introducing physics and cutting back on British, in favour of Australian, history. Born in London, Archdale was the daughter of a suffragette and a Irish soldier in the British army. Her godmother was Emmeline Pankhurst. The memory of visiting her own mother, imprisoned in Holloway after a demonstration, was a lifelong inspiration. Archdale was educated at Bedales school, Hampshire, St Leonard's school, St Andrews, McGill university in Montreal - where she graduated in economics and political science - and London university, where she read law. Specialising in international law, she studied in the Soviet Union but was, she said, a socialist, not a communist. She was called to the bar in 1938. As well as a feminist, Archdale was also a cricketer, and captained the England women's first - and victorious - tour of Australia. She served as a WRNS officer in the far east, Africa, Australia and the Pacific during the second world war. Then, in 1946, she was back in Sydney. Later, at Abbotsleigh, she won the support of hitherto conservative parents and daughters and was loved by both generations. Archdale retired in 1970 and lived with her brother Alexander in a house they built themselves outside Sydney. She adored appearing on television and radio, and two years before her death was voted a \"living national treasure\".

I'm out to make a dollar.\" He made a well-received visit to Britain in 1965, but by the end of the decade was working as a comedian in a Honolulu strip club. Various recording projects in the 1970s came to nothing, and his contribution to the movie, American Hot Wax (1978), was cut to a few scenes. The Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards played on a 1979 recording of I Put A Spell On You, one of many revisions Hawkins attempted over the years, culminating in a 1991 dance version. Hawkins continued to work during the 1980s and 1990s, albeit at a lower temperature. He had cameo roles in the films Mystery Train (1989) and A Rage In Harlem (1991), and in 1998 received a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm &amp; Blues Foundation. Always popular in France, he had moved to the Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he died. Tony Russell Jalacy J Hawkins, singer, born July 18 1929; died February 12 2000",

      "body": "<p>About a month after my son, Billy, was born I took a walk on London's Hampstead Heath. It was January three years ago. We were alone. Me, an ecstatic mother in my new camel hair Christmas coat and a small boy in an old-fashioned green bouncy pram his grandmother had sent from Glasgow.</p> <p>I took the path through the trees far from the tweedy dog walkers and sniffed the sweet smell of wet rotting leaves. Then, through the wood, came a man with his shoulders rounded up towards his ears. He had a black V-neck pullover. No shirt. He wasn't wearing a coat. Although we seemed to be the only souls on that charcoal day, he walked past us. He never looked up.</p> <p>In all my years of foreign reporting - feeling the pop of a bullet beside my ear in Timor or lying under a tree trunk in Chechnya looking up at the iron belly of a Russian gunship - nothing compares to the terror of feeling someone is going to hurt your baby.</p> <p>When I met Vjolica (pronounced Volitsa) Berisha in a sunny garden in Kosovo on June 15 last year, she brought me back to that day in the Hampstead trees. Our circumstances are a million miles apart. I feel uncomfortable even writing about them on the same page. But until that wet day in the woods, I don't think I had begun to understand the real pain of war. Then I understood that war was not just about blood, bullets or bones, but about the pure, terrible fear of being unable to protect your child.</p> <p>I went into Kosovo a few hours behind the German Nato troops. It was mid-June. We moved in with a family in the town of Prizren who fed us meatballs in spicy tomato sauce and fresh mango - as though we had personally liberated Kosovo.</p> <p>Suva Reka, about 20 miles from our base, was a small town on the road to somewhere else. But for Vjolica Berisha it was the place where she was born, grew up, married and became the mother of three children. In the burned-out shopping precinct past the Beni Tours travel shop, there is a coffee shop with blue barstools. Here she saw her children murdered. In my mind I still have a picture of a woman trying to hide her toddler son between her legs, then feeling the bullet thud into his body.</p> <p>The morning I walked into the coffee house, the white pillars were still splattered in blood. There was blood on the radiators; blood from whoever was hiding behind the cappuccino machine. The lilac tablecloths were still strewn across the floor where they had been pulled on to the ground. On the coffee bar, the breadbaskets had been filled for a lunch that had never happened; in the fridge, there were a dozen eggs and tub of Belgrade yoghurt.</p> <p>More than 50 people were in here, mainly women and children. I looked across the blackened floor and imagined them lying here - mothers trying to cover the bodies of their children. A local man wandered up. There were two survivors, he said. One of them, Vjolica Berisha, was still around somewhere.</p> <p>It took a while to find her. Wounded in the attack, she had hidden from the muslim hunters. Her two daughters died that morning. When the international troops arrived she crawled out of hiding, a bullet still in her hip from two months earlier - she had been too frightened to look for a doctor. She told the story without emotion.\"It is so hard to explain the sound a child makes when they are dying,\" she said. \"You can't imagine it - it's not a scream exactly . . .\"</p> <p>She described how the group of mothers and children had hidden in the coffee shop after being chased by two armed men. \"I saw my daughter, Dalphina. We were looking at each other across the bodies and she was moving her lips as though she was saying something to me. I heard Majoinda [her niece] calling out to her mother, 'Mummy what are we going to do?' Then someone threw a hand grenade in on top of her. I saw Alton, my sister's boy, looking across the room for her then he made a noise like 'oouf' and he died.\"</p> <p>Fifty-three people, most of them women and children and most of them from the Berisha family, died in the coffee shop that morning, the day after Nato planes began their war against Serbia.</p> <p>Vjolica pretended to be dead when her body was lifted with the others onto a truck that arrived after the shooting. She was tossed on top of her own mother's dead body. As the truck took off she remembers lifting her head and looking across at her sister, Shyreta, who still had her dead two-year-old baby cradled in her arms. \"It was like she couldn't bear to put him down. She was holding on to him until the very last minute. Shyreta saw I was alive as well and said, 'I am going to jump. If I die jumping it doesn't matter because I am dead already inside.'\"</p> <p>None of her four children had survived. Vjolica remembers watching her sister gently lay down the body of her baby - a small corpse in a pile of grown-up blood. Then they jumped.</p> <p>That is the image that haunts me most from 10 years in this job - a mother clinging for those last seconds to the body of her two-year-old. The agony of watching your child die and not being able to protect it.</p> <p>On Hampstead Heath that January day, I kept walking along the muddy path, never changing my pace, never turning my head to see where the man with no eyes was. I saw a bend ahead and turned it. I yanked Billy's pram behind a tree and watched the man in the black sweater. Through what was left of the winter leaves, I saw him stop. His head up now like a gun-dog scanning, turning, then creeping after us. Slow, deliberate, alert.</p> <p>I pulled Billy's pram tight, so the shining chrome of the polished handle was buried in my stomach. Then, I heard a voice rasping in my head. I was rehearsing a primeval scream and a message for the man who was coming for my baby. My legs were weak. But I felt a dazzling strength in my body that was completely new to me. I knew that if he touched my child, I would rip his head off with my teeth. For the first time in my life, I understood real terror at being unable to protect my child.</p> <p>Suddenly the creeping man stopped. He was about 10ft from our tree. He turned around again and walked away. I waited and then ran, the big round wheels of Billy's pram crashing along the muddy path. On the other side of the wood, where the heath stretches back towards the city, I paused to stop shaking.</p> <p>I am not comparing a hairy experience on Hampstead Heath to the violent loss of a child. It is just that without my own brief, visceral moment of fear, I could not begin to understand what those women have been through. I have been writing about wars for 10 years now. When Billy arrived three years ago, I never thought of packing it in. Of course the logistics of leaving my son for three weeks at a time had to be organised. There was Paula, who picked him up from nursery, who loves him and feeds him better than I ever did. There was Sharifa from Afghanistan, who came to live with us when the Taliban made it impossible for her to stay at home, and a husband who can spoon Branflakes and talk into a mobile phone at the same time.</p> <p>Besides, most of the time I was happy to go. My thumb pressing on the reclining seat on the plane, head back - gin and tonic in front of me. Freedom. The old life, the old adventures, the old friends. Depending on how busy I was, the yearning for him did not start for a week or so. In the last three years, I've stopped carrying his photos to shove in patient people's faces, and I've learned to slice out all thoughts of him the second they sneaked up on me.</p> <p>For much of the time now I'm a 37-year-old mother concerned with the usual things: staying under 11 stone, loving a three-year-old boy. I swim a bit, gym a bit, smoke a bit. Then for half of the year, I go to places where people are killing each other - and where they often hate foreign journlists.</p> <p>The year 1999 was busy: Kosovo, East Timor, then Chechnya. In time I had found ways to forget my life as a mother when on assignment. But on my first trip, just six months after Billy was born, I understood that motherhood had changed the way I would look at war forever. In Cambodia's S21 Prison, where the Pol Pot regime executed the higher cadres and their children, the condemned were photographed before execution. Staring out from the wall of the prison museum that still smelt of their blood was a young woman with her six-month-old baby stretched out on the metal bed beside her. She had the number 320 pinned to her collar and she looked into the camera with what seemed like powerless acceptance of what was going to happen to her and her baby.</p> <p>Upstairs, somewhere in the dusty archives, were the folders of the condemned. I spent four days searching for something about her. It was an obsession. I was driven through file after dusty file, maddened by the look on her face and by her naked child beside her on the iron frame of the prison bed. I was trying to imagine her mind - knowing that, in a day or two, someone would take her baby from her and smash his head open on the trees of the Killing Field outside Phnom Penh. They never wasted bullets on children.</p> <p>In the leukemia ward of the Saddam Hussein's Children's Ward in Baghdad, I felt the same madness. The figures of two parents stooped over their 13-year-old son who would die tomorrow. The drugs he needed were forbidden under sanctions. Imagine watching your child die because some politicians in France, Britain and the US can't think of a better way of getting rid of Saddam. I had sometimes felt anger in my previous trips to Baghdad, but after Billy it was different.</p> <p>Back in Europe meanwhile, the ugly pens of the revisionists have already begun their work on Kosovo. A man called Laughland, a former lecturer at the Sorbonne, wrote an article in the Spectator under the headline: The Massacres That Never Were. He wrote that there hadn't been a single body found in Suva Reka. I contacted him. He said he'd made a couple of mistakes in that article, which he corrected later, and bodies had been found in Suva Reka.

      "bodyText": "About a month after my son, Billy, was born I took a walk on London's Hampstead Heath. It was January three years ago. We were alone. Me, an ecstatic mother in my new camel hair Christmas coat and a small boy in an old-fashioned green bouncy pram his grandmother had sent from Glasgow. I took the path through the trees far from the tweedy dog walkers and sniffed the sweet smell of wet rotting leaves. Then, through the wood, came a man with his shoulders rounded up towards his ears. He had a black V-neck pullover. No shirt. He wasn't wearing a coat. Although we seemed to be the only souls on that charcoal day, he walked past us. He never looked up. In all my years of foreign reporting - feeling the pop of a bullet beside my ear in Timor or lying under a tree trunk in Chechnya looking up at the iron belly of a Russian gunship - nothing compares to the terror of feeling someone is going to hurt your baby. When I met Vjolica (pronounced Volitsa) Berisha in a sunny garden in Kosovo on June 15 last year, she brought me back to that day in the Hampstead trees. Our circumstances are a million miles apart. I feel uncomfortable even writing about them on the same page. But until that wet day in the woods, I don't think I had begun to understand the real pain of war. Then I understood that war was not just about blood, bullets or bones, but about the pure, terrible fear of being unable to protect your child. I went into Kosovo a few hours behind the German Nato troops. It was mid-June. We moved in with a family in the town of Prizren who fed us meatballs in spicy tomato sauce and fresh mango - as though we had personally liberated Kosovo. Suva Reka, about 20 miles from our base, was a small town on the road to somewhere else. But for Vjolica Berisha it was the place where she was born, grew up, married and became the mother of three children. In the burned-out shopping precinct past the Beni Tours travel shop, there is a coffee shop with blue barstools. Here she saw her children murdered. In my mind I still have a picture of a woman trying to hide her toddler son between her legs, then feeling the bullet thud into his body. The morning I walked into the coffee house, the white pillars were still splattered in blood. There was blood on the radiators; blood from whoever was hiding behind the cappuccino machine. The lilac tablecloths were still strewn across the floor where they had been pulled on to the ground. On the coffee bar, the breadbaskets had been filled for a lunch that had never happened; in the fridge, there were a dozen eggs and tub of Belgrade yoghurt. More than 50 people were in here, mainly women and children. I looked across the blackened floor and imagined them lying here - mothers trying to cover the bodies of their children. A local man wandered up. There were two survivors, he said. One of them, Vjolica Berisha, was still around somewhere. It took a while to find her. Wounded in the attack, she had hidden from the muslim hunters. Her two daughters died that morning. When the international troops arrived she crawled out of hiding, a bullet still in her hip from two months earlier - she had been too frightened to look for a doctor. She told the story without emotion.\"It is so hard to explain the sound a child makes when they are dying,\" she said. \"You can't imagine it - it's not a scream exactly . . .\" She described how the group of mothers and children had hidden in the coffee shop after being chased by two armed men. \"I saw my daughter, Dalphina. We were looking at each other across the bodies and she was moving her lips as though she was saying something to me. I heard Majoinda [her niece] calling out to her mother, 'Mummy what are we going to do?' Then someone threw a hand grenade in on top of her. I saw Alton, my sister's boy, looking across the room for her then he made a noise like 'oouf' and he died.\" Fifty-three people, most of them women and children and most of them from the Berisha family, died in the coffee shop that morning, the day after Nato planes began their war against Serbia. Vjolica pretended to be dead when her body was lifted with the others onto a truck that arrived after the shooting. She was tossed on top of her own mother's dead body. As the truck took off she remembers lifting her head and looking across at her sister, Shyreta, who still had her dead two-year-old baby cradled in her arms. \"It was like she couldn't bear to put him down. She was holding on to him until the very last minute. Shyreta saw I was alive as well and said, 'I am going to jump. If I die jumping it doesn't matter because I am dead already inside.'\" None of her four children had survived. Vjolica remembers watching her sister gently lay down the body of her baby - a small corpse in a pile of grown-up blood. Then they jumped. That is the image that haunts me most from 10 years in this job - a mother clinging for those last seconds to the body of her two-year-old. The agony of watching your child die and not being able to protect it. On Hampstead Heath that January day, I kept walking along the muddy path, never changing my pace, never turning my head to see where the man with no eyes was. I saw a bend ahead and turned it. I yanked Billy's pram behind a tree and watched the man in the black sweater. Through what was left of the winter leaves, I saw him stop. His head up now like a gun-dog scanning, turning, then creeping after us. Slow, deliberate, alert. I pulled Billy's pram tight, so the shining chrome of the polished handle was buried in my stomach. Then, I heard a voice rasping in my head. I was rehearsing a primeval scream and a message for the man who was coming for my baby. My legs were weak. But I felt a dazzling strength in my body that was completely new to me. I knew that if he touched my child, I would rip his head off with my teeth. For the first time in my life, I understood real terror at being unable to protect my child. Suddenly the creeping man stopped. He was about 10ft from our tree. He turned around again and walked away. I waited and then ran, the big round wheels of Billy's pram crashing along the muddy path. On the other side of the wood, where the heath stretches back towards the city, I paused to stop shaking. I am not comparing a hairy experience on Hampstead Heath to the violent loss of a child. It is just that without my own brief, visceral moment of fear, I could not begin to understand what those women have been through. I have been writing about wars for 10 years now. When Billy arrived three years ago, I never thought of packing it in. Of course the logistics of leaving my son for three weeks at a time had to be organised. There was Paula, who picked him up from nursery, who loves him and feeds him better than I ever did. There was Sharifa from Afghanistan, who came to live with us when the Taliban made it impossible for her to stay at home, and a husband who can spoon Branflakes and talk into a mobile phone at the same time. Besides, most of the time I was happy to go. My thumb pressing on the reclining seat on the plane, head back - gin and tonic in front of me. Freedom. The old life, the old adventures, the old friends. Depending on how busy I was, the yearning for him did not start for a week or so. In the last three years, I've stopped carrying his photos to shove in patient people's faces, and I've learned to slice out all thoughts of him the second they sneaked up on me. For much of the time now I'm a 37-year-old mother concerned with the usual things: staying under 11 stone, loving a three-year-old boy. I swim a bit, gym a bit, smoke a bit. Then for half of the year, I go to places where people are killing each other - and where they often hate foreign journlists. The year 1999 was busy: Kosovo, East Timor, then Chechnya. In time I had found ways to forget my life as a mother when on assignment. But on my first trip, just six months after Billy was born, I understood that motherhood had changed the way I would look at war forever. In Cambodia's S21 Prison, where the Pol Pot regime executed the higher cadres and their children, the condemned were photographed before execution. Staring out from the wall of the prison museum that still smelt of their blood was a young woman with her six-month-old baby stretched out on the metal bed beside her. She had the number 320 pinned to her collar and she looked into the camera with what seemed like powerless acceptance of what was going to happen to her and her baby. Upstairs, somewhere in the dusty archives, were the folders of the condemned. I spent four days searching for something about her. It was an obsession. I was driven through file after dusty file, maddened by the look on her face and by her naked child beside her on the iron frame of the prison bed. I was trying to imagine her mind - knowing that, in a day or two, someone would take her baby from her and smash his head open on the trees of the Killing Field outside Phnom Penh. They never wasted bullets on children. In the leukemia ward of the Saddam Hussein's Children's Ward in Baghdad, I felt the same madness. The figures of two parents stooped over their 13-year-old son who would die tomorrow. The drugs he needed were forbidden under sanctions. Imagine watching your child die because some politicians in France, Britain and the US can't think of a better way of getting rid of Saddam. I had sometimes felt anger in my previous trips to Baghdad, but after Billy it was different. Back in Europe meanwhile, the ugly pens of the revisionists have already begun their work on Kosovo. A man called Laughland, a former lecturer at the Sorbonne, wrote an article in the Spectator under the headline: The Massacres That Never Were. He wrote that there hadn't been a single body found in Suva Reka. I contacted him. He said he'd made a couple of mistakes in that article, which he corrected later, and bodies had been found in Suva Reka. But he maintained his thesis was correct: that the numbers of dead were exaggerated to justify the war and that, since the numbers of dead were probably not as high as 10,000, no international force should have been sent in. In those first weeks after the international troops arrived, the people of Kosovo buried those they loved. Maybe they buried 10,000, perhaps only 5,000. Does it really matter? What happened in Kosovo in the months leading up to the war and in the awful backlash following Nato bombs - which undoubtedly made things worse - was evil. Stopping it was important. Does the fact that there were 53 women and children murdered in the coffee shop, and not 530, mean that mass graves don't exist in Kosovo and the war wasn't justified? I'd like to see Laughland sitting opposite Shyreta and listening to her talk about those last seconds holding the warm body of her baby, of jumping from the truck and leaving behind her four children. Some time during those last days in Kosovo, my second child died in my womb. It was a month later, on holiday in Italy, before I knew that the foetus was dead and had waited to miscarry. In the wonderful hospital near Florence, a fat cheerful gynaecologist scanned my then flabby belly: \"It's gone - all gone,\" she said congratulating me on the thorough job my body had done getting rid of the foetus. My husband, standing in the corner of her surgery with Billy in his arms, had tears in his eyes; I felt very little. I can't remember if it was at that moment, or during the long night that my body was rejecting the foetus, that I thought of Shyreta and her four dead children, of those final seconds when she held the body of her smallest one. Or the second when she laid him down before she jumped. That's the thing about this war business. For me, it sharpens the simple moments of joy. Watching my child discovering the children's section of the Ormeau Road library in Belfast. First there's the shock of so many books, the shining, uncontrollable moment when he simply can't bear to decide where to start. His eyes running frantically from Postman Pat to Rupert the Bear. The joy of being alive on an icy Belfast day by the River Lagan and still having a child to hold.",

The tax could wipe out more than 5,000 jobs and end Bond Street's international supremacy. </p> <p>\"We have argued tenaciously for the British art market and British artists, but we have moved to a point where an agreement is not far off,\" one official in Brussels said. </p> <p>The retreat brings to an end a battle stretching back to the early 1990s to shield Britain's world-beating auction houses and dealers from VAT and the droit de suite tax, which passes a slice of resale prices to an artist or heirs.

      "bodyText": "Britain is expected today to give up the fight against a new Euro-tax on the London art market. The tax could wipe out more than 5,000 jobs and end Bond Street's international supremacy. \"We have argued tenaciously for the British art market and British artists, but we have moved to a point where an agreement is not far off,\" one official in Brussels said. The retreat brings to an end a battle stretching back to the early 1990s to shield Britain's world-beating auction houses and dealers from VAT and the droit de suite tax, which passes a slice of resale prices to an artist or heirs. Britain is to accept a compromise tabled in the autumn, although it will try throughout today to win some improvements to that package. London art dealers claim that droit de suite will drive sellers away from the European Union altogether to rival centres such as New York, Tokyo and Switzerland, which do not levy the tax. But the government is unable to fight off the tax, which is a single-market measure and subject to majority voting. It has lost the argument that London, as the EU's premier international art market, ought to be protected.

Like Mr Dyson, they will keep current sites open but put future investment abroad. </p> <p>Last night, at the Engineering Employers Federation (EEF) biennial dinner, Bruce Ralph, president, told Stephen Byers, trade and industry secretary: \"The narrow remit of the MPC [Bank of England monetary policy committee] unsupported by other fiscal measures must inevitably reinforce the view of much of our membership that house price inflation in the south-east, perhaps in part driven by City bonuses ... is a case of the tail wagging the dog.\" </p> <p>He added: \"We understand the issues and the pressures but, with the pound at a 14-year high, large sections of our industry are now hurting - and hurting badly - and something needs to be done.\" </p> <p>Sir Brian Moffat, Corus chairman, who calculates that the old British Steel operations have lost \u00a31bn in profits over the past three years through an over-valued pound, went further last week and said manufacturing in Britain was fighting for its existence. </p> <p>Sterling, partly because it is a petro currency and oil prices have been at a nine-year high, nudging $30 (\u00a318) a barrel or three times the level of 15 months ago, is already worth in excess of 8% more than it was last year when its average value was DM2.97. </p> <p>And that, said Mr Dyson, is a 30%<strong> </strong> overvaluation, implying that a pound is now worth around DM2.40. In his designer slacks and T-shirt, Mr Dyson is an unconventional business executive who has stored up a series of pet hates, most notably Eddie George, the Bank's governor, whom he accuses of caring not a jot about manufacturing. </p> <p>\"Well, he's completely wrong about that. It's extremely important, it's a vital part of the economy,\" Mr Dyson told Five Live. Elsewhere he has said manufacturing is the engine-room of the whole economy. </p> <p>But, as ever, there is more to this than a campaign against the MPC and its so-called fine-tuning of monetary policy to meet an alleged medium-term inflationary threat. Mr Dyson, who employs 1,800 workers in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, including those at his \u00a320m hush-hush design centre, faces an outbreak of nimbyism against his plans for expansion. </p> <p>The inventor, who has long promised to come up with a brand-new idea beyond variations on a bag-less cleaner theme and has yet to do so, may want to move to the Far East to be closer to his overseas markets - he exports up to \u00a360m of output each year, including to Japan, and claims not to make a penny. He may well be seeking cheaper, more skilled labour. </p> <p>But the real targets of his ire are restrictive planning regulations, uncertain economic policy and the nimbyism which, he claims, are putting at risk Britain's technology and industrial competitiveness. Equally, however, his cleaners, which commanded some 70% of the British market, are facing stiffer competition from domestic (and foreign) rivals who used to scoff at his appliances. \"If we do not become a global player within five years we will be swallowed up.\" </p> <p>He sees the euro zone as the marketplace in which he succeeds or fails in his ambitions and is an enthusiast for early British entry. His remarks found a strong echo in Sir Ken Jackson of the AEEU, the labour movement's most active euro supporter. \"It does not mean that the jobs will go tomorrow but will drift abroad over a period and the longer-term future of Britain as a manufacturing nation will be blighted,\" he said. \"Ministers had better understand that if we delay entry too long there may be nothing left to save.\" </p> <p>But the evidence is that ministers are convinced UK industry can live with a strong pound and, indeed, cut costs further and close the productivity gap with our euro zone neighbours. Digby Jones, the new CBI director general, has suggested manufacturing can cope with a DM2.80 exchange rate - above the DM2.60 once thought propitious for Britain's entry to the euro but well short of current levels. </p> <p>Even the EEF, which identified a 6% productivity growth in its latest quarterly survey, has begun to talk of living with a strong pound and to desist from calling for instant devaluation or cuts in borrowing costs as the panacea for all manufacturing's ills. </p> <p>Last night Mr Bruce, its president, joined forces with Mr Dyson in pointing out that even services depend on industry. Manufacturing, he said, may represent just 22% of GDP -and falling - \"but you can add 15% or so for support services and businesses and it punches way above its weight in accounting for 60% of exports.\" </p> <p>At a time when investors are shunning heavyweight sectors, forcing their shares down disproportionately, Mr Bruce and Mr Dyson are putting themselves at the head of an informal campaign to save British manufacturing.

Elsewhere in the banking sector, however, Lloyds TSB shares were down 37p at 561p, while Royal Bank of Scotland shares were down 20p at 787p. Traders reckon both suffered from investors switching into Barclays and RBS is seen as having plenty on its plate in integrating National Westminster , up 4p at \u00a311.37. Another heavyweight reporting figures yesterday was BP Amoco , down 8p at 475p. The group's fourth quarter figures were seen as slightly disappointing and the absence of news on either the share buy-back programme or the ongoing dispute with the US authorities over the proposed acquisition of Atlantic Richfield was seen as a drag, too. Utilities, often overshadowed by hi-tech stocks, were back in favour with investors attracted by what are being perceived in some quarters as undemanding ratings. BG was up 8p at 267p, Scottish Power climbed 11p to 425p and Centrica was up 11p on the day at 184p. Housebuilders found themselves in the doldrums, hit by what was seen as a fairly hefty hint from the governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, on Monday night that interest rates are likely to rise again, while reports that the government was looking at the possibility of taxing housebuilding added to the sense of depression. Beazer Group was down 5p to 103p while Bryant fell 6p to 96p. Hi-tech stockbroker Durlacher continued its recent strong run as the shares powered 182p to \u00a339.50 which puts them up by more than \u00a35 so far this week. Another stock firmly in favour yesterday was Psion , climbing 634p to 4,360p as its Symbian consortium announced a link-up with IBM.",

      "body": "<p>The delicacy of the Bank of England's task in setting interest rates was starkly highlighted yesterday when the office for national statistics unveiled its latest snapshot of price pressures in the economy. </p> <p>On the face of it, the data were good. Consumers are sniffing out bargains in the shops, inflation excluding mortgages remains doggedly below the government's target and Britain is Europe's standard-bearer for price stability. Of the 2.1% increase in underlying inflation over the past 12 months, the most important single factor has been the surge in oil prices. Production curbs by the Opec cartel and stronger world demand have meant that the price of a barrel of crude has soared since this time last year, pushing up the cost of petrol by almost a fifth. </p> <p>On an admittedly rough and ready basis, the 19% increase in the cost of petrol and oil has contributed 0.7 percentage points to the 2.1% annual inflation rate. Without the increase, underlying inflation would stand at around 1.4%, below the level at which the governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, would have to write to the chancellor in explaining why inflation was so low. </p> <p>Most analysts believe that the latest inflation figures will give the Bank pause for thought, and they are probably right. Base rates have gone up four times in the past six months, and it will be hard for the monetary policy committee to justify further increases unless there is strong evidence that the government's target would be breached without further tightening. </p> <p>However, while the Bank might be prepared to suck it and see for the next few months, it is likely to be concerned by the UK's reliance on a strong pound for keeping the cost of living low. At present, the high exchange rate is making imports cheaper, keeping the lid on the prices of goods. But if sterling were to fall - as the Bank has been predicting for some time - the price of goods in the shops would rise unless retailers were prepared to reduce profit margins. </p> <p>Sellers of domestic services have had life far easier than clothing and footwear stores or shops selling videos and mobile phones.

      "bodyText": "The delicacy of the Bank of England's task in setting interest rates was starkly highlighted yesterday when the office for national statistics unveiled its latest snapshot of price pressures in the economy. On the face of it, the data were good. Consumers are sniffing out bargains in the shops, inflation excluding mortgages remains doggedly below the government's target and Britain is Europe's standard-bearer for price stability. Of the 2.1% increase in underlying inflation over the past 12 months, the most important single factor has been the surge in oil prices. Production curbs by the Opec cartel and stronger world demand have meant that the price of a barrel of crude has soared since this time last year, pushing up the cost of petrol by almost a fifth. On an admittedly rough and ready basis, the 19% increase in the cost of petrol and oil has contributed 0.7 percentage points to the 2.1% annual inflation rate. Without the increase, underlying inflation would stand at around 1.4%, below the level at which the governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, would have to write to the chancellor in explaining why inflation was so low. Most analysts believe that the latest inflation figures will give the Bank pause for thought, and they are probably right. Base rates have gone up four times in the past six months, and it will be hard for the monetary policy committee to justify further increases unless there is strong evidence that the government's target would be breached without further tightening. However, while the Bank might be prepared to suck it and see for the next few months, it is likely to be concerned by the UK's reliance on a strong pound for keeping the cost of living low. At present, the high exchange rate is making imports cheaper, keeping the lid on the prices of goods. But if sterling were to fall - as the Bank has been predicting for some time - the price of goods in the shops would rise unless retailers were prepared to reduce profit margins. Sellers of domestic services have had life far easier than clothing and footwear stores or shops selling videos and mobile phones. Prices of insurance and holidays have risen as the economy has entered its ninth year of expansion, and show little sign of responding to higher interest rates. While it is normal for inflation in services to be higher than that for goods, the extent of the divergence is unusual. According to Michael Saunders of Salomon Smith Barney Citibank, core services inflation stands at 5.6% and has been nearly 2% above overall inflation on average since 1988. If normal service were restored, inflation excluding mortgages would be 3.6%, well above the government's target.

A dude in jeans and a T-shirt marked \"Posh Boy\" urges them on. \"In Gangland, it's getting dark. It's getting late, your heart begins to palpitate, in Gangland,\" they chant, crouching on the floor. When South African author and director David Kramer calls this all-black production a \"loose reworking\" of Shakespeare's tragedy he isn't joking. Poison is set in a club on a north London housing estate and concerns Michael, a corrupt club owner, Lyric, a singer addicted to crack, Poison, his dealer, and Pam, an anti-drugs campaigner. The story tackles racism, the music business and gangsterism. The production was originally staged in Cape Town, and has been reworked for Britain by playwright Jenny McLeod.

Perhaps Lear's daughters should have had the courage to call him \"bully bottom\" and told him to stop playing the fool. </p> <p>Mitchell's latest miserable git is Mr Green, the anti-hero of Jeff Robson's New York comedy Visiting Mr Green. Mr Green is not a happy man. An orthodox Jew, he is elderly, infirm and lives four flights up in a New York tenement block. His beloved wife has recently died, and he hasn't seen his daughter for years. He wants to be left alone. But every Thursday night, Ross Gardiner, a young corporate executive ordered to do community service, insists on visiting him. Soon this odd couple forge an unlikely relationship. </p> <p>Playing Green is a bit of a stretch for Mitchell. The old man is 86; Mitchell is a stripling at 74. Although, in his food-stained shirt and with his wild haystack eyebrows, Mitchell could easily pass for Methuselah. Mitchell's approach to character owes much to method acting. Halfway through the meal I realise that I'm having lunch with two people, both the fictional Mr Green and Mitchell. One is a bit of a misery guts who complains about the food, the other is a wizened pixie with an Australian suntan, a string of anecdotes and plenty of reasons to be cheerful. </p> <p>After more than 30 years of playing Garnett, Mitchell is now hitting his prime. There's a lot of acting in the old boy yet. \"You don't retire in this business, you just notice that the phone hasn't rung for 10 years,\" he quips. He's an actor who has always made his own luck, bringing a foolish humanity to the appalling Garnett and scarring the character into the nation's psyche as he reflected all the postwar resentment and prejudice that was swilling around in the nation's consciousness. </p> <p>He wasn't even first choice for the role: Peter Sellers, Leo McKern and Lionel Jeffries all turned Alf down. But Mitchell recognised the subversive brilliance of Speight's foul-mouthed creation and gave Alf's spleen and foolishness full rein. The fact that Mitchell was Jewish was part of the joke. Although, of course, not everyone got the satire. \"There have been times when I've felt ashamed. When I've been doing Alf to a live audience and he says something like 'Enoch Powell had the right idea' or 'Adolf Hitler had his moments,' and somebody in the audience cheers.\" </p> <p>Mitchell has no time for actors who complain of being typecast. \"Either they never try to play anything else, or they're not capable of doing anything else,\" he says, in Mr Green mode. Until his 40s, when Alf came along, he was a jobbing actor who regularly turned up as the foreign baddie in series such as The Saint or Dangerman. Alf has been his bread and butter - he still does a touring one-man show called The Thoughts of Chairman Alf - but it is parts such as Lear, Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman and now Mr Green that are the jam. He likes it spread thickly, as if making up for lost time. </p> <p>\"I've been lucky, I've worked with all the greatest writers: Shakespeare, Pinter, Speight. Johnny deserves his place with them. It's part of that establishment thing that Johnny and I never got any honours - not that we'd have wanted them - whereas shows like Yes, Prime Minister did. It was good, they deserved it. But it reinforced the establishment idea that politicians are nice people.\" </p> <p>Even when he hasn't been wanted, Mitchell has the chutzpah to suggest himself. He persuaded director Michael Rudman to cast him as Willy Loman in the 1979 National Theatre production of Death of a Salesman, against the advice of others who wanted a classical actor in the role. Mitchell walked away with all the best actor awards that year, his shrimp-like, Jewish Loman giving a new spin on Miller's famous loser. When he read in the paper that Jude Kelly was thinking about directing King Lear, he wrote and suggested himself for the part. He thinks it's high time he had a go at Prospero. He doesn't understand actors who get tired of the challenges. \"I remember once hearing Anthony Hopkins interviewed on the radio and he was saying how he'd done all the wrinkly tights stuff and was happy to be a big film star. When he was asked what his idea of perfect happiness was, he said it was waking up in the morning and knowing that he wouldn't have to play Lear that night. I like nothing more than waking up and knowing I'm going to play Lear.\" </p> <p>Mr Green isn't Lear, but it is a meaty role and one he has already tried out successfully in Australia, where he now lives for a substantial part of the year. He became an Australian citizen in 1989, warms to the people's lack of guilt about enjoying themselves, and says he has used the place quite shamelessly to get to play the roles he wants and feels that he'd never be considered for here. \"I'd never have got to play Norman in The Dresser, or be in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? here.\" In Australia he played Lear 17 years before he got the chance in Britain. </p> <p>Visiting Mr Green takes him back to his own roots in London's Jewish East End. Like Green's family, Mitchell's grandparents were Russian Jews who fled to Britain in 1910. His grandmother opened a fish and chip shop in Stoke Newington, reasoning that whether times were good or bad people always ate fish and chips. \"I've always wanted a fish and chip shop to fall back on,\" says Mitchell, and he's not joking. </p> <p>But Mitchell is a million miles away from Green. \"Green is an orthodox Jew. I enjoy being Jewish, but I'm an atheist. Green is a fundamentalist and I hate fundamentalism in all its forms. Jews, Catholics, Baptists, I think they are all potty and capable of destroying the world.\" </p> <p>And of breaking up families. Green is estranged from his daughter because she has married a gentile. After Mitchell married his wife, Connie, his own father, by no means an orthodox Jew and perfectly capable of keeping a kosher house for 50 weeks then eating bacon sandwiches on the family's annual Clacton holiday, would not meet her for two years because she was not Jewish. \"He'd ring me every day and ask me 'Are you eating son?'.\" Eventually time and grandchildren healed the rift, but Mitchell understands the kind of gulf that people like Green can create. </p> <p>\"I was lucky with my dad. He was so proud of me. He loved being Alf Garnett's dad. I once made a sitcom called Men of Affairs with Brian Rix. It wasn't good. After the first episode was broadcast dad rang me and asked 'How many did you make?' 'Seventeen.' There was a long pause, then he said: 'I couldn't go to the office this morning.

After causing \u00a370,000 of damage, he was this week jailed for two and a half years, which is a long time to serve for garlic bread.",

Fears of the unquantified cuts on top of 5,300 last year were raised as Barclays revamped its incentive scheme for top executives to match a new management ethos announced yesterday by Matt Barrett, the new Irish-Canadian chief executive. Mr Barrett, addressing the City for the first time since joining Barclays in October, laid out a \"hard hitting\" strategy to double \"economic\" profit every four years while cutting \u00a31bn of costs by 2003. The City initially reacted enthusiastically, with the share price rising 8%, although eventually they closed just 5p higher at \u00a314.38p. The new management plan, similar to that adopted at Lloyds TSB, was announced as Barclays - which spent much of last year without a chief executive - reported a 30% rise in pre-tax profits to \u00a32.5bn. Mr Barrett refused to disclose how many jobs would be affected by his aim to cut costs, saying he wanted to discuss the situation with the union. He admitted, however, that it was \"inescapable\" that job numbers were declining in lower skilled sectors but stressed more jobs were being created in \"knowledge\" areas. The new incentive package - which is still to be approved by shareholders - will involve a \"higher risk of no pay-out\", Mr Barrett said. The bank will have to meet its profits forecasts and shares will have to perform better than those of 11 of its rivals. The bank increased its dividend by 16% to 50p a share. Barclays said it would continue to buy back shares but did not say how many. Mr Barrett's introduction of \"value based management\" is designed to allow him to use \"economic profit\" as benchmark to compare businesses and returns to shareholders. Businesses that fail to meet the mark would be disposed of, he said. But he offered his backing for Barclays Capital, the investment banking arm. \"As a blueprint, [value based management] is as good as anything we're aware of for a bank of this kind,\" said Richard Coleman of Merrill Lynch.",

To: Miss B. Subject: Knickers. I'm thinking of buying my girlfriend some lingerie. Do girls like crotchless pants? From: Miss B. To: Mr P. Subject: Calling the police. Leave me alone, you pervert. And so on, for pages and pages of email printouts. Not only does Mr P appear to be the world's daftest harasser, he doesn't know when to quit.

      "body": "<p>I used to think ex-pat wives spent their days teaching servants how to lay tables. Now I am one and I don't even own a table. I didn't in England and I don't in Germany. If I were to throw an ex-pat dinner party, my guests would have to eat off their laps. </p> <p>Business globalisation makes working abroad increasingly easy in many fields. If you are freelance, like me, as long as you have the technology, you can work almost anywhere. It also makes it more likely that at some point you or your partner will be able to - or have to - work abroad. So what do you do when your partner gets offered a job overseas? Can his career survive if he doesn't go? Can yours survive if you go, too? And can your relationship survive either the uprooting or the separation? </p> <p>My husband was offered an ideal new job a year ago. It so happened it was in Germany. This might be seen as an obstacle (friends' reactions ranged from confusion to sympathy and gifts of Marmite) but I could see no reason to stay at home. It came at a good time for me: I had sold a novel half-written and I had a deadline to finish it. I positively needed fewer lunch invitations and as a freelance journalist, most of my work was done over the phone. Based in Europe, the phone bill would obviously swell, but I figured I'd save money on daily travel. </p> <p>My German was enough to be able to make German friends. But it was like the first days at college, rather random. One friend I met in a coffee shop, another at the baker's. Conversation is inevitably stumbling, less interesting, more of an effort. I spend more time on my own, which I do happily, but I need a good evening. It is harder for my husband to come home in a bad mood if he is the first person I've spoken to all day. We have to negotiate nights he goes to the gym. </p> <p>As an ex-pat partner, you are initially more dependent. Eric Walters moved from the US to Germany when his partner, Claire, moved with her TV production company. Like hers, his skills were international: he is a computer consultant, English is the dominant language in his field and he knew he'd have no trouble finding a job. He now works from home, travelling to Amsterdam every few weeks. </p> <p>The difficulties he is having, he says, are related to life, not work. \"It was definitely a big change. I effectively liquidated my life in the States. I got rid of a big car, good job, great flat. I'd had all my comforts, all my favourite things, and I had to figure out new ones. Not speaking German is the biggest handicap. But I could either sit at home being miserable or go out and do something. I am learning the language - slowly.\" </p> <p>He admits the couple are \"more tied together\" now. \"Inevitably my circle of friends is made up of Claire's work colleagues. I can't meet Germans because all I can do is nod and smile. I miss having my own friends, I miss the American service culture, but it's worth it for the experience of seeing that other places are different - not necessarily wrong, just different.\" </p> <p>For a partner, the problem is isolation. Julia Alessandro gave up her job in PR and moved to LA with her boyfriend shortly after getting pregnant. \"I love everything about California,\" she says, \"except that I am so far from my friends and family. And it seems to become more important. I know people but it's not the same as friends you've had for years who you can be boring with and not worry. I want to go back to the UK but my boyfriend is reluctant as he's doing well at work. I can't work without a permit, so I feel tied to a man in a way I never envisaged. I can't even buy him a gift without knowing that he's paying for it.\" </p> <p>The alternative, of course, is for one partner to stay put. Email has made this a far more viable option, according to Michael Wright, whose girlfriend is working for a charity in Manila. \"When Anna's mother moved to Dar es Salaam in the early 60s, she got to speak to her family on the phone twice a year. It meant arranging an appointment at the exchange. Anna and I can send each other stupid jokes twice a day. That's a lifeline.\" </p> <p> Anna is on a two-year secondment and the couple talk roughly twice a week. Michael sighs. \"It was important to Anna to take this opportunity and I couldn't stand in her way. But nor would I go with her. I was not about to chuck in my job, I hate hot countries and adaptation to a more basic way of life is not something I want to try. I need home delivery, Blockbusters, rollerblading, caffe latte. But I couldn't stop Anna. If I said no, the issue would always be between us. </p> <p>\"She's having a wonderful time but I do worry that she won't want to come back. The house is empty without her. We have tried to be practical: two years is a long time, I'll probably only see her three or four times. We agreed we could have sex with other people as long as we didn't talk about it or fall in love. I feel we'll probably end up stronger. Either that or split.\" </p> <p>The key to success in the \"should I stay or should I go\" dilemma is, it seems, self-knowledge. Michael is honest enough to know that life in a developing country is not for him. Anna knows she needs to do it. There is a risk to the relationship, of course, but a split might happen anyway. </p> <p>Colin Bailey of the charity Voluntary Service Overseas agrees. \"The people who have the worst time abroad are the ones who think it will be exciting and glamorous. In fact, moving abroad can be isolating, particularly for a partner. VSO carefully vets partners as well as volunteers before they are accepted. The couples who make a go of it are adaptable and can cope with time on their own. You need initiative to make new friends and work out a new life for yourself. It is a challenge but it can be a rewarding one and both experiences, separation or travelling together, can be good for a relationship.\" </p> <p>No one knows how many Britons migrate every year, but Jean-Pierre Garson, head of international migration at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, says there is little doubt more are going. \"It is easy to do with the English language. For example, there is lots of trade between France and Germany, and the language spoken is generally English.\" There is more migration from England, he says, probably because there is more opportunity. </p> <p>But opportunity for what, exactly? What is it we gain by deliberately removing ourselves from a comfortable set-up and moving to an alien environment? Even in a country as close as Germany, when the shops shut at 4pm on Saturdays and housewives strip on prime-time game shows, it can seem a dark and weird place. The partner who moved for their job has reason enough: more money, better CV, sense of achievement. But the partner who moved for them - what reason do they have? </p> <p>It's challenging, of course, making your own career work despite obstacles, and it is probably better for the relationship that you should experience change together. And at the very least, when you want to move to Paraguay, your partner is going to have a hard time saying no.</p>",
