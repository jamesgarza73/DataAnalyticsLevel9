      "body": "<p>This has been a week of firsts. My first time in a sea kayak, first time camping by myself, first ride in a helicopter and my first time ice climbing on a glacier.</p> <p>I also finally began to think about what I'm going to do when I get back to England. \"Why - you have four months yet?\" I hear you say. Well for me this trip is as much about the travelling as finding the time and space to figure out where my life is heading.</p> <p>I didn't manage this in the US - too rushed and too soon. I started to get close in Fiji but I still needed some time out just to relax completely and leave everything behind. However, three days kayaking and hiking by myself in the empty wilderness of New Zealand's coastal Abel Tasman National Park gave me plenty of time to think about a lot of things. But first let me tell you how I got there.</p> <p>I'm travelling round New Zealand with a tour company called Magic Bus. They offer a variety of routes round both North and South Islands covering all the main highlights. Buses run every day of the week during the summer so I've been jumping on and off as I please. The downside is that I am restricted by the pre-defined route, but there are advantages: the driver books your accommodation and sorts out any activities you might want to do. And best of all, if you get a good driver (and I've only had one who wasn't really enthusiastic) you get an excellent commentary on the sights and sounds of New Zealand. These range from pointing out the small farm where the current prime minister grew up, to explaining New Zealanders' hatred of possums. They also all seem to be obsessed with telling you the population of each town you go through.</p> <p>The tours are very laid back. The majority of people on the bus are in their mid-twenties, but there are always a few older and younger people too. The other main tour bus, Kiwi Experience, is supposed to be more of a party bus. You have to wear a dress and down 10 pints before they let you into the hostel - that sort of thing.

      "bodyText": "This has been a week of firsts. My first time in a sea kayak, first time camping by myself, first ride in a helicopter and my first time ice climbing on a glacier. I also finally began to think about what I'm going to do when I get back to England. \"Why - you have four months yet?\" I hear you say. Well for me this trip is as much about the travelling as finding the time and space to figure out where my life is heading. I didn't manage this in the US - too rushed and too soon. I started to get close in Fiji but I still needed some time out just to relax completely and leave everything behind. However, three days kayaking and hiking by myself in the empty wilderness of New Zealand's coastal Abel Tasman National Park gave me plenty of time to think about a lot of things. But first let me tell you how I got there. I'm travelling round New Zealand with a tour company called Magic Bus. They offer a variety of routes round both North and South Islands covering all the main highlights. Buses run every day of the week during the summer so I've been jumping on and off as I please. The downside is that I am restricted by the pre-defined route, but there are advantages: the driver books your accommodation and sorts out any activities you might want to do. And best of all, if you get a good driver (and I've only had one who wasn't really enthusiastic) you get an excellent commentary on the sights and sounds of New Zealand. These range from pointing out the small farm where the current prime minister grew up, to explaining New Zealanders' hatred of possums. They also all seem to be obsessed with telling you the population of each town you go through. The tours are very laid back. The majority of people on the bus are in their mid-twenties, but there are always a few older and younger people too. The other main tour bus, Kiwi Experience, is supposed to be more of a party bus. You have to wear a dress and down 10 pints before they let you into the hostel - that sort of thing. You can probably guess by now that that isn't really my style, so I'd opted for Magic. By the time the bus reached the city of Nelson on the South Island the sun had come out (hooray). I had booked a three-day sea kayaking and hiking trip and after a night in Nelson I headed out to the park to grab my paddle. Abel Tasman covers a relatively small area in comparison to New Zealands's other National Parks, but it's incredibly beautiful with golden beaches, lush gullies and thick forests. Road access only extends as far as the park entrances, so to get into the wilderness you must walk in or take a boat. I was in a small group of three double kayaks, and after our guide for the day, Kea, had set out the proposed route and given a quick demonstration of what to do in the unlikely event of capsizing we got onto the water. It was a unique experience. The waters were crystal clear and quite calm. We paddled out along the coast, dipping into secluded bays. Kea pointed out the wildlife and told us the history of the park as we went along riding the waves. We pulled up on a beach for a leisurely lunch and a bit of snorkelling before setting off again. In the afternoon, the wind picked up so all three kayaks came together to form a raft and we put up a sail attached to the paddles.

I stopped to have a solitary dip in a cold, deep pool surrounded by forest. And it was now with only myself and the cicadas for company that I began to think about my life and where it was going. In London, I'd had a pretty good life with great friends, a well-paid, interesting job and I had been saving to buy a flat. I had done all the things you were supposed to do: school, university, proper grown-up job. I have ticked all the boxes but like many people my age, all I'm left with is a feeling of \"is this it?\" I'm the sort of person that will always believe the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. But looking back, I did jump into my first job without really thinking about what I actually wanted to do or what sort of quality of life I was looking for. It may well be that I decide the civil service is for me after all, but I have definitely decided that I don't want to live in London any longer. I'm fed up with urban life. I want to live by the sea or up in the mountains with clear air and beautiful views. Admittedly, I might get a little bored so that's why I need to come up with an interesting variety of jobs (rather than one single career) to keep me busy. Ideas so far include travel writing (you'll have to judge whether that's viable or not); teaching people to sail or kayak (ok I've not got much experience at the moment but it would be fun); running a Bed and Breakfast (after staying in numerous hostels, I reckon I know exactly what makes a good place). I'm sure more useful ideas will follow. I walked 11 miles that day and spent my second night camped on an empty beach, and after another day's hike across a wide estuary, I caught a water taxi back home. The next day I was back on the Magic Bus heading down the west coast and it was raining again. There's no half measures with weather here: it's either pouring or clear blue skies. The scenery was now very dramatic with steep gorges, glaciated valleys, thick rainforests and wild rocky coastlines. It all looked very young - as though everything had only just been formed and the elements hadn't had the chance to erode it all down. We passed through a series of isolated towns with dreary names like Westport and Greymouth before reaching the spectacular Westland National Park.

I'm not so naive to think that I'm somehow going to come up with the great solution and then go off to live happily ever after.

      "body": "<p>I seem to have spent the whole week getting smashed and attacked by the water in various ways, but hasn't stopped me from enjoying myself! The first day of this week I received a disturbing mail from home telling me I'd not got too much money left. It brought a bit of a reality check on to how best to spend the rest of my time in Sydney, so I decided I would try to achieve the most fun as possible on a minimal budget. And in a city as alive as this, it's extremely possible. </p> <p>So, that evening I took a walk along the coast I'd not yet explored, away from Coogee towards Maroubra beach. Surrounded by the smell of the ocean and the sound of crashing waves blown by the imminent storm I was again reminded how lucky I am. Then a storm broke. Realising that I was going to be soaked to the skin whatever, I stopped to watch the die-hard surfers at Maroubra beach before making my wet way back to the hostel. I'm just hoping this will be the last of the recent bad weather and the November floods Sydney saw aren't planning a come-back - I thought I'd escaped them when I left England! </p> <p>This week it's dawned on me how desperately I want my own place for a little while. One of my biggest fears before I left was that I'd end up alone - I'd like to reassure any other traveller in the same position that this will not happen. It will probably never happen in fact. I was sat on my bed, vainly attempting to read Bill Bryson, but failing because people were constantly coming in and out. This culminated in my talkative dormmate's return when he leapt onto my bed, and announced he was going to read with me. I was starting to long for a little bit of peace. </p> <p>The next morning I woke full of energy so rose early for a short walk/jog to neighbouring Clovelly then back. On my return I stopped for a quick dip in the sea and got a costly reminder that the ocean isn't my friend. The waves at Coogee can be reasonably strong and I'm not a brilliant swimmer, so I only just went out of my depth, but after my jog I soon needed to return to shore again. With the tide against me this was a lot harder than swimming out had been, and soon I was totally exhausted. It was at this point that I got pounded by a giant wave that held me underwater for a long time until I eventually came up coughing, with fortunately just a long graze down my back from the sand to show for it. </p> <p>After limping back to the hostel, the first guy I told laughed and told me ambulances carry people off from Coogee at least once a week - which left me wisely cautious of my next trip into the sea. The same day I had my second disturbing mail of the week, from those friendly Guardian travel people, saying they'll be getting calls from alcoholics anonymous about me! So, for the rest of this week - and the future - I'm experimenting to see how much money an average Brit in Oz would save by keeping off the drink. I'll let you know at the end of the report how it's gone. </p> <p>In the evening I went with Brian to my much loved spot, Darling Harbour. There are still so many activities being held there until the upcoming Australia Day that I can't believe I've neglected it for a while. Firstly we watched a bizarre lazer show named Fish Opera which literally was just that, then moved straight on to watch some fire jugglers. Various differences between mine and Brian's homes were becoming apparent all the time - I was impressed by the jugglers, but he told me they'd never have made it in LA! I think our sweeping generalisation on different nations is that Australians seem happiest, women from LA are most attractive and the English. . . well, we'd both got bored of hearing their voices more frequently than Australian accents! </p> <p>That evening there was also the Festival de Cuba on the harbour, and we stumbled across a brilliant Mexican band called Los Del Abajo who got a 2000-strong crowd dancing and jumping to their lively brand of Latin/ska/punk. After the brilliant band finished we headed for the Daintree Cafe to continue dancing - largely because we'd seen a cameraman enter first. We also both noticed the great ethnic diversity of Darling Harbour in comparison to Coogee which partly explains my love of the place. That evening was fantastic - dancing, salsaing and generally working up a sweat for the price of nothing and fuelled by water. Also, the main thing: that evening I got a place of my own!! </p> <p>I'd been texting a girl (the wonders of mobile phones) about an advert I'd picked up that evening, and just a few hours later after a quick look and think I decided to go ahead and take the spare bed. My new apartment may be basic but at long last I have a place to call my own. Woo-hoo!! </p> <p>Saturday morning I packed up my world into my bag again and carried everything up the hill to my new home (still in Coogee). For once I can actually describe a place as home! </p> <p>That afternoon I'd been hoping to go to Watson's Bay. This was one of the last spots in Sydney I'd been advised to go to through the feedback mails, and the writer had specified Saturday afternoon. Brian and I took the bus there, but exhaustion from the night before meant we both collapsed in a spot of shade as soon as we arrived! Watson's Bay was definitely a nicer area of Sydney. Boats were out sailing in their masses enjoying the weekend sun, no doubt from the many private jetties attached to the beachside houses. </p> <p>Late afternoon we headed back to the domain in central Sydney to enjoy another free concert, this time by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Though we arrived early we still struggled to find a spot - I guess some people must have been there all day waiting, judging by the fact that one group had a table and chairs set out for dinner! Despite it being neither of our first choices musically, the concert left us with a good feeling -especially as the last piece was accompanied by cannons and fireworks in time with the music, soaring over the top of the neighbouring skyscrapers. </p> <p>The next morning I woke and stood on the balcony of my own apartment. Gazing out across the view of uptown Coogee I felt inordinately happy. Myself and a guy named Pete from the apartment then headed to the beach so I could get back into the water. Luckily he had a snorkel with him, and remembering how much I'd loved it in Hawaii I was soon floating face-down in the ocean - even though there were no fish. I felt I'd conquered my temporary fear. </p> <p>In the evening me, Brian and a diminutive Canadian girl, Shauna, returned to Darling Harbour for the last day of the Festival de Cuba. This time we arrived early so we could participate in Learn to Merengue classes lead by a slick-looking Brazilian and his scantily dressed sexy dancers. I don't think the massed crowed achieved anything resembling their moves, but at least we had a lot of fun! After that we had our second helping of Los Del Abajo only this time we must have jumped about even more, if possible. The three of us came away tired (again) but definitely happy. </p> <p>Then on Monday I went for a walk across the harbour bridge to North Sydney, Kirribilli and beyond as I hadn't really been that way before. In a shop on the way, I got talking to the assistant, and it turned out he lives about 10 miles from my home in England. It really is a small world at times. </p> <p>I had a weekly travel pass, so took full advantage of it by spending the afternoon ferry-hopping about the harbour. My roommate Michaela then phoned to tell me I had a trial at her The French Bistro restaurant, where she worked too, the next day, so I cut short my exploration to save myself for my first day's work in a while! </p> <p>Next afternoon I was having a short amount of sun and sea before my evening's employment. I was in the water when I felt a hot pain across my legs, and looked down to see what looked like a blue string of seaweed with bobbles attached to my leg. Unfortunately I recognised this as one of the tentacles of a bluebottle jellyfish, one of the many Australian creatures that will happily cause you pain. Leaving the water I rushed to the first aid stand set up specifically for those who get stung (and who are careless enough to have not kept a closer eye on the water) to rub ice into my bright red leg. The attendant happily informed me that a girl had once swallowed one, so my sting was nothing. He was right too - though it hurt, by the evening it had totally subsided, leaving only a trail of little red dots as a reminder if where it had been. </p> <p>I hadn't been particularly nervous about my trail shift at the restaurant, but maybe I should have been. The boss was a Frenchman who was extremely particular about the running of his restaurant. After a 15-minute look at the menu I was given a pad and basically had to get to it. My evening's work certainly brought me down to earth a bit - it made me realise that, unfortunately, I can't spend my whole life enjoying the leisure I've had up until now. Even though I've been a waitress before (and hello to everyone at Holes Bay), after five hours I was completed exhausted. Which reminds me, I've got another job trial in two hours from now, so I'd best be off. . . Until next week (when I can increase my $28 total made from drinking water . . )<br> Milly</p>",

In the evening me, Brian and a diminutive Canadian girl, Shauna, returned to Darling Harbour for the last day of the Festival de Cuba. This time we arrived early so we could participate in Learn to Merengue classes lead by a slick-looking Brazilian and his scantily dressed sexy dancers. I don't think the massed crowed achieved anything resembling their moves, but at least we had a lot of fun! After that we had our second helping of Los Del Abajo only this time we must have jumped about even more, if possible. The three of us came away tired (again) but definitely happy. Then on Monday I went for a walk across the harbour bridge to North Sydney, Kirribilli and beyond as I hadn't really been that way before. In a shop on the way, I got talking to the assistant, and it turned out he lives about 10 miles from my home in England. It really is a small world at times. I had a weekly travel pass, so took full advantage of it by spending the afternoon ferry-hopping about the harbour. My roommate Michaela then phoned to tell me I had a trial at her The French Bistro restaurant, where she worked too, the next day, so I cut short my exploration to save myself for my first day's work in a while! Next afternoon I was having a short amount of sun and sea before my evening's employment. I was in the water when I felt a hot pain across my legs, and looked down to see what looked like a blue string of seaweed with bobbles attached to my leg. Unfortunately I recognised this as one of the tentacles of a bluebottle jellyfish, one of the many Australian creatures that will happily cause you pain. Leaving the water I rushed to the first aid stand set up specifically for those who get stung (and who are careless enough to have not kept a closer eye on the water) to rub ice into my bright red leg. The attendant happily informed me that a girl had once swallowed one, so my sting was nothing. He was right too - though it hurt, by the evening it had totally subsided, leaving only a trail of little red dots as a reminder if where it had been. I hadn't been particularly nervous about my trail shift at the restaurant, but maybe I should have been. The boss was a Frenchman who was extremely particular about the running of his restaurant. After a 15-minute look at the menu I was given a pad and basically had to get to it. My evening's work certainly brought me down to earth a bit - it made me realise that, unfortunately, I can't spend my whole life enjoying the leisure I've had up until now. Even though I've been a waitress before (and hello to everyone at Holes Bay), after five hours I was completed exhausted. Which reminds me, I've got another job trial in two hours from now, so I'd best be off. . . Until next week (when I can increase my $28 total made from drinking water . . ) Milly",

The decision to pardon Mr Rich, who fled to Europe 18 years ago to avoid 51 charges of tax evasion, racketeering and illegal trading with Iran, has become the most controversial of the record 140 pardons Mr Clinton issued on Saturday, just hours before he handed over the presidency to George Bush. Mr Rich's pardon covers all the charges against him, which included cheating the US government out of $48m in taxes and trading with an enemy by defying trade sanctions against Iran while more than 60 Americans were being held hostage in the US embassy in Tehran in 1978-80. Mr Rich, 65, is now free to return to the United States, though he is no longer a citizen. Most presidential pardons are given to people who have been convicted of their crimes, served their sentences or repented of what they did. Mr Rich, who never even made a court appearance to answer the charges against him, fits none of these categories. As a result, his pardon shines a fresh spotlight on the nexus of favours and influence between the Clinton White House and its richest donors. The indignation focuses on the fact that Mr Clinton and the former White House counsel Jack Quinn - who coordinated efforts on Mr Rich's behalf - kept the possibility of a pardon secret from the justice department and the prosecutors in charge of the case. This bypassing of the normal procedures left the prosecutors \"shocked and flabbergasted\", officials said. The New York Times, normally a defender of Mr Clinton, described Mr Rich's pardon as \"a shocking abuse of presidential power\" which \"undermined the pursuit of justice\". The mayor of New York, Rudolph Giuliani, who was the prosecutor who brought the case against Mr Rich in 1983, said he found it \"very, very hard to understand\" Mr Clinton's decision. Other Republicans have been less diplomatic. The lobbying effort on behalf of Mr Rich involved a Who's Who of prominent Israelis, who emphasised the financier's role as a generous backer of dozens of Jewish and Israeli causes. Among those who wrote to Mr Clinton were the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, a former head of the Mossad secret service, Shabtai Shavit, and the musical director of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, Zubin Mehta. A central role was also played by Mr Rich's former wife Denise, who has given more than $1m to the Democrats, as well as giving the maximum $10,000 donation to Mr Clinton's legal defence fund.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair last night ordered an investigation into the passport application case which led to Peter Mandelson's dramatic resignation.</p> <p>The former Treasury solicitor Sir Anthony Hammond QC begins work today on reviewing the case to ensure the application \"was properly dealt with in all respects\". The inquiry is certain to examine in detail whether Mr Mandelson's initial raising of billionaire Srichand Hinduja's proposal to apply for British citizenship with immigration minister Mike O'Brien had any influence on the outcome.</p> <p>It will also look at the role of passport application sponsors.</p> <p>Mr Blair told the Commons yesterday that he believed the application from Srichand Hinduja, who with his brother provided \u00a31m of sponsorship for the Millennium Dome's faith zone, had been handled in \"accordance with the proper criteria\".</p> <p>The home secretary, Jack Straw, is also satisfied that the proper procedures were followed and that his minister of state, Mr O'Brien, acted correctly. But a thorough inquiry could unearth new facts.</p> <p>Officially, applications for naturalisation should be handled impartially by civil servants without any ministerial influence. Mr Blair promised to publish the inquiry's findings but Downing Street said no date had been fixed for the completion of the inquiry - so it could come out after the expected May 3 date for the general election. Nor is the government committed to publishing all the details surrounding the passport application.</p> <p>Last night Srichand Hinduja said he was saddened by Mr Mandelson's resignation. He said: \"I wish to reiterate that I have never at any time linked our support for the faith zone of the Millennium Dome with a request to Mr Mandelson for information in 1998.\"</p> <p>The Hinduja foundation was created to support multicultural and cross-religious dialogue and its support for the dome was to fulfil those objectives and \"not for any other reason\", he said.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair last night ordered an investigation into the passport application case which led to Peter Mandelson's dramatic resignation. The former Treasury solicitor Sir Anthony Hammond QC begins work today on reviewing the case to ensure the application \"was properly dealt with in all respects\". The inquiry is certain to examine in detail whether Mr Mandelson's initial raising of billionaire Srichand Hinduja's proposal to apply for British citizenship with immigration minister Mike O'Brien had any influence on the outcome. It will also look at the role of passport application sponsors. Mr Blair told the Commons yesterday that he believed the application from Srichand Hinduja, who with his brother provided \u00a31m of sponsorship for the Millennium Dome's faith zone, had been handled in \"accordance with the proper criteria\". The home secretary, Jack Straw, is also satisfied that the proper procedures were followed and that his minister of state, Mr O'Brien, acted correctly. But a thorough inquiry could unearth new facts. Officially, applications for naturalisation should be handled impartially by civil servants without any ministerial influence. Mr Blair promised to publish the inquiry's findings but Downing Street said no date had been fixed for the completion of the inquiry - so it could come out after the expected May 3 date for the general election. Nor is the government committed to publishing all the details surrounding the passport application. Last night Srichand Hinduja said he was saddened by Mr Mandelson's resignation. He said: \"I wish to reiterate that I have never at any time linked our support for the faith zone of the Millennium Dome with a request to Mr Mandelson for information in 1998.\" The Hinduja foundation was created to support multicultural and cross-religious dialogue and its support for the dome was to fulfil those objectives and \"not for any other reason\", he said. The Hinduja brothers, who moved the centre of their growing business empire from India to Britain in the 1980s, were generous benefactors in the Asian community and had well-placed social connections. Among guests invited to celebrate the Hindu festival of Diwali were Mr Blair and his wife Cherie. But it was widely known at the time Srichand Hinduja applied for a British passport that the two brothers could face charges over alleged corruption over the huge Bofors gun contract to the Indian government. Last week they were granted bail by an Indian court while the allegations are investigated.

On a freezing January afternoon in Moscow when the 18-year-old should be dozing through another dull lecture in his law course at Moscow university, he is instead ensconced on the fifth floor of a plush new business centre in the east of the city clutching a day-glo green gizmo. </p> <p>\"I've been coming here every day for about a month,\" he recounts, his gaze fixed firmly on the small LCD screen in his right hand. Like teenagers everywhere, he has trouble looking you in the eye when hypnotised by a computer game. </p> <p>The room is filled with some 60 Muscovite teenagers having great fun. What's more, they get paid for it. All of them are sending each other messages via the hand-held toys, or playing games and making notes. </p> <p>Behind them, a gang of older website designers are perched at desktops drawing fantasies. On the two floors below them another 150 programmers and engineers are beavering away round-the-clock, producing instant computer games for posting on the web or new software for their pride and joy. </p> <p>Welcome to the wacky Russian world of Cybiko. The $100 handheld gizmo combines the functions of a Game Boy, a personal digital assistant, and a wireless communicator all in one. </p> <p>It might be marketed in America and made in Taiwan, but the brainpower is here in eastern Moscow, with a bunch of young boffins, graduates of the elite cybernetics schools of the old Soviet military-industrial complex, quickly adapting to the new world of virtual entertainment, taking on the Sonys and Nintendos of this world, and emerging with a winner. </p> <p>Kharchev and his mates are installed in a room echoing with giggles, whoops,and whistles as he and his chums put the new Cybiko games through their paces and make notes on the new games before they are released on to the web. There they are downloaded free of charge by the armies of American teenagers snapping up this year's must-have accessory. </p> <p>\"The response is amazing,\" says Alexei Logoshin, the Cybiko production manager who flits between Moscow and Taiwan, while his boss and Cybiko's creator, David Yang, divides his time between Moscow and Bloomingdale outside Chicago. </p> <p>\"We get around 40,000 messages on the website every day.

      "bodyText": "Maksim Kharchev just can't keep away from the Cybiko lab. On a freezing January afternoon in Moscow when the 18-year-old should be dozing through another dull lecture in his law course at Moscow university, he is instead ensconced on the fifth floor of a plush new business centre in the east of the city clutching a day-glo green gizmo. \"I've been coming here every day for about a month,\" he recounts, his gaze fixed firmly on the small LCD screen in his right hand. Like teenagers everywhere, he has trouble looking you in the eye when hypnotised by a computer game. The room is filled with some 60 Muscovite teenagers having great fun. What's more, they get paid for it. All of them are sending each other messages via the hand-held toys, or playing games and making notes. Behind them, a gang of older website designers are perched at desktops drawing fantasies. On the two floors below them another 150 programmers and engineers are beavering away round-the-clock, producing instant computer games for posting on the web or new software for their pride and joy. Welcome to the wacky Russian world of Cybiko. The $100 handheld gizmo combines the functions of a Game Boy, a personal digital assistant, and a wireless communicator all in one. It might be marketed in America and made in Taiwan, but the brainpower is here in eastern Moscow, with a bunch of young boffins, graduates of the elite cybernetics schools of the old Soviet military-industrial complex, quickly adapting to the new world of virtual entertainment, taking on the Sonys and Nintendos of this world, and emerging with a winner. Kharchev and his mates are installed in a room echoing with giggles, whoops,and whistles as he and his chums put the new Cybiko games through their paces and make notes on the new games before they are released on to the web. There they are downloaded free of charge by the armies of American teenagers snapping up this year's must-have accessory. \"The response is amazing,\" says Alexei Logoshin, the Cybiko production manager who flits between Moscow and Taiwan, while his boss and Cybiko's creator, David Yang, divides his time between Moscow and Bloomingdale outside Chicago. \"We get around 40,000 messages on the website every day. At Christmas when all the American kids got their new Cybikos, we got 143,000.\" But the teenage testers in the Moscow lab cannot buy themselves a Cybiko. The wireless networks operate on radio frequencies whose use would land them in jail in Russia. \"Besides,\" says Logoshin, \"the market here is too small. It's targeted at teenagers, but there's not many Russian teenagers who can afford $100 for a Cybiko.\" But Kharchev and his pals are extremely willing mice in the Cybiko lab and there's no stopping the infectiously enthusiastic cyberfreaks. Downstairs a bunch of hardware engineers are producing prototypes for a new model. \"Slimmer, smoother, and cooler,\" they say, proudly displaying their work. It's all a rare and cheering triumph in a Russia more noted for its collapsing infrastructure and technological backwardness than a cutting edge entertainment industry. \"Russians are great engineers and great scientists, but they need a lot of help turning good ideas into successful products,\" says Vaidyanathan Sivakumar, a Moscow-based Indian fund manager. He put together a consortium last year to plough more than $16m into Cybiko, gaining 23% of the company in the process. \"We are very happy with our investment,\" he says, not ing that the company expects to sell more than half a million gizmos in North America this year after 300,000 since last September.

In a day of high drama not equalled at Westminster since Mr Mandelson's previous resignation, over his secret home loan in 1998, the man who helped to craft New Labour's modernising image for 15 years stepped down as the Northern Ireland secretary and renounced all strategic responsibility for the coming general election. Waking up to a barrage of hostile headlines yesterday, both Tony Blair and Mr Mandelson almost certainly knew it was all over by the time they met at number 10 in mid-morning. Three hours later came an apologetic resignation statement in the street outside. Before the meeting the prime minister's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, had refused to endorse the Northern Ireland secretary when he briefed reporters. \"The prime minister has got to face the House of Commons this afternoon and there are a number of areas of fact he feels the need to pin down.\" In their hour-long meeting Mr Blair and his most trusted aide discussed why the media, Mr Campbell and ministers were misled for 48 hours about Mr Mandelson's single phone call to Mike O'Brien, the immigration minister, in June 1998. Mr Mandelson insisted he had done nothing improper, but accepted that he had not told the whole truth about his intervention in the application for naturalisation by Srichanda Hinduja, a wealthy Indian businessman. After revelations in the Observer on Sunday, Mr Mandelson had insisted that he had merely asked his private office to pass on a request for information regarding a possible application from Mr Hinduja to the Home Office in June 1998. In fact he made the crucial two-minute phone call in person. In the same month the Hinduja brothers offered to sponsor the faith zone at the Millennium Dome. Mr Mandelson, as the cabinet office minister, was in charge of the Greenwich project. Mr Mandelson, who was out of office for 10 months after the Guardian's revelations about his \u00a3373,000 home loan from Geoffrey Robinson, is now entitled to his second ministerial pay-off, of \u00a312,129, in just over two years.

In a survey published in advance of next week's local government financial settlement, the LGA says 85% of English social services departments will end up an average \u00a32m in the red. Most councils have blamed increasing pressures relating to children's services, especially the cost of providing residential accommodation for children in care. The LGA has also speculated that attempts by social services departments to tighten up child protection services in the wake of recent scandals may have contributed to the overspend.

      "body": "<p>The chief statistician yesterday identified a rise in immigration as the most significant social change in Britain of recent years.</p> <p>Len Cook, the former head of New Zealand's statistical service who took over as the UK national statistician in July, said population patterns through most of the 20th century had changed dramatically during the 1990s as migration became the main engine of population growth.</p> <p>The figures came in Social Trends, the official annual digest of facts and figures about life in Britain. It also showed growing inequalities between rich and poor, mounting consumer debt and increasing use of credit cards instead of cash or cheques.</p> <p>Mr Cook said \"homegrown\" population increases - the surplus of births over deaths - hugely exceeded net migration into the UK from 1900 to 1990. Indeed for much of the century there was a net outflow of people. But between 1991 and 1999 net immigration averaged 104,000 a year, compared with a homegrown population rise averaging 107,000.</p> <p>Mr Cook said the change was particularly stark in the closing years of the century, when migration became the predominant demographic influence. Immigration overtook natural population growth in England and Wales in 1994-95. By 1998-99 net inward migration increased to 194,000, while natural population growth fell to 72,000. \"This amounts to a huge shift in the importance of immigration to changes in the British population, with consequences for ethnic mix and age structure,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Since immigrants go disproportionately to London, it will also affect where people live.\"</p> <p>The immigrants came mainly from outside the European Union. Refugees who were granted asylum or given leave to stay made up a small proportion - just over 10,000 in 1999. On Monday the Home Office forecast between 150,000 and 175,000 immigrants from outside the EU each year until 2005.</p> <p>Barbara Roche, the immigration minister, said: \"The UK is a nation of immigrants. Immigration is a very good thing and has benefited the country.\" Advantages included skills brought by workers needed by the expanding information technology industry, and the younger age profile of immigrants that would help to balance the pressures of an ageing population.</p> <p>Social Trends estimated that the UK population would rise from 59.5m in 1999 to peak at nearly 65m in 2036. Population growth in England, Wales and Northern Ireland would be partly offset by a slight fall in Scotland.</p> <p>The survey said the British population had increased by more than half during the 20th century, but the number of households tripled in the same period to almost 24m in spring 2000.</p> <p>Almost three in 10 households comprised one person in spring 2000 - more than two and a half times the proportion in 1961.</p> <p>There were 179,000 first marriages in the UK in 1999 - less than half the number in 1970. The average age of women at childbirth in England and Wales rose over the same period from 26.2 years to 29.</p> <p>The survey found that the distribution of income became more unequal in the 80s, stabilised in the early 90s and began to widen again in 1997. In 1997-98 the income of the richest 10% rose 4% to \u00a3559.70 a week, while for the poorest it rose only 1.8% to \u00a3136.10.</p> <p>Latest official figures for 1998 showed that Britain was the most expensive European country outside Scandinavia. A British resident would find goods and services at least 10% cheaper in Italy and the Netherlands, and more than 20% cheaper in Spain, Greece and Portugal.</p> <p>The amount of consumer credit outstanding in the UK increased to \u00a3115bn in 1999, almost double the 1987 level in real terms. The volume of cash payments fell during the 1990s but still accounted for two-thirds of all transactions.</p> <p>Plastic card payments tripled, cash withdrawals doubled and there was a 75% increase in direct debits, standing orders and other automated payments. Payments by cheque declined by a quarter. About one in five debit card purchases in supermarkets involved cashback, with an average value of \u00a324.</p> <p>The survey came on the bicentenary of the first British census. In 1801 there were about 10m people in Britain and about 2m households. Since then population has increased by nearly six times and the number of households by 12 times. In 1821 half the population was aged under 20, compared with a quarter in 1999.</p> <p><b>The nation by numbers</b></p> <p>Social Trends, a 268-page snapshot of UK life published by the office of national statistics, contains 321 tables and charts. Here are some of the facts they contain:</p> <p>\u0095 Between 1981 and 1999 the number of GPs in Britain rose by a third to 36,000. But the number of nurses and other direct care staff in NHS hospitals and community health services fell by 4%</p> <p>\u0095 The proportion of three- and four-year-olds enrolled in UK schools tripled from 21% in 1970-71 to 64% in 1999-00. In spring 2000, 5.7m people of working age were studying towards a qualification in the UK, just over half of whom were aged 16-24</p> <p>\u0095 The consumption of fresh potatoes has fallen steadily from 1,300 grams a person a week in 1974 to less than 700 grams in 1999. But fresh fruit consumption rose over the same period from 500 grams to nearly 750 grams</p> <p>\u0095 In 1999 about 276,000 hectares of land had been converted, or were in the process of being converted, to organic farming. This was six times more than in 1995</p> <p>\u0095 In spring 2000 there were 27m people of working age in employment in the UK - the most since 1959 when records began. Over that period the proportion of men in work fell to 79% while the proportion of women rose from 47% to 69%</p> <p>\u0095 Among non-married women under 60, the proportion cohabiting almost doubled between 1986 and 1998-99 - from 13% to 25%. For men it more than doubled from 11% to 26%</p> <p>\u0095 Three-quarters of adults agree that \"families with working mothers need grandparents' help more and more\". One in 10 said grandparents have \"little to teach the grandchildren of today\"</p> <p>\u0095 A third of domestic water in England and Wales was used for personal washing, including baths, showers and hand basins. A quarter - between 35 and 45 litres a head a day - was used for flushing the toilet, according to environment agency statistics for 1997-98.</p> <p>\u0095 The proportion of houses fitted with a burglar alarm doubled between 1992 and 2000, from 13% to 26%</p> <p>\u0095 The breeding population of woodpigeons doubled between 1971 and 1999, while great tits, chaffinches and robins were up by at least a quarter. But the population of skylarks, yellowhammers and song thrushes fell by more than half and starlings declined by 65%</p> <p>\u0095 In spring 2000, there were 855,000 people working in IT-related occupations, an increase of 45% in five years. In 1999-00 two in five UK households had a PC - almost three times as many as in 1985</p>",

In 1997-98 the income of the richest 10% rose 4% to \u00a3559.70 a week, while for the poorest it rose only 1.8% to \u00a3136.10. Latest official figures for 1998 showed that Britain was the most expensive European country outside Scandinavia. A British resident would find goods and services at least 10% cheaper in Italy and the Netherlands, and more than 20% cheaper in Spain, Greece and Portugal. The amount of consumer credit outstanding in the UK increased to \u00a3115bn in 1999, almost double the 1987 level in real terms. The volume of cash payments fell during the 1990s but still accounted for two-thirds of all transactions. Plastic card payments tripled, cash withdrawals doubled and there was a 75% increase in direct debits, standing orders and other automated payments. Payments by cheque declined by a quarter. About one in five debit card purchases in supermarkets involved cashback, with an average value of \u00a324. The survey came on the bicentenary of the first British census. In 1801 there were about 10m people in Britain and about 2m households. Since then population has increased by nearly six times and the number of households by 12 times. In 1821 half the population was aged under 20, compared with a quarter in 1999. The nation by numbers Social Trends, a 268-page snapshot of UK life published by the office of national statistics, contains 321 tables and charts. Here are some of the facts they contain: \u0095 Between 1981 and 1999 the number of GPs in Britain rose by a third to 36,000. But the number of nurses and other direct care staff in NHS hospitals and community health services fell by 4% \u0095 The proportion of three- and four-year-olds enrolled in UK schools tripled from 21% in 1970-71 to 64% in 1999-00. In spring 2000, 5.7m people of working age were studying towards a qualification in the UK, just over half of whom were aged 16-24 \u0095 The consumption of fresh potatoes has fallen steadily from 1,300 grams a person a week in 1974 to less than 700 grams in 1999. But fresh fruit consumption rose over the same period from 500 grams to nearly 750 grams \u0095 In 1999 about 276,000 hectares of land had been converted, or were in the process of being converted, to organic farming. This was six times more than in 1995 \u0095 In spring 2000 there were 27m people of working age in employment in the UK - the most since 1959 when records began. Over that period the proportion of men in work fell to 79% while the proportion of women rose from 47% to 69% \u0095 Among non-married women under 60, the proportion cohabiting almost doubled between 1986 and 1998-99 - from 13% to 25%. For men it more than doubled from 11% to 26% \u0095 Three-quarters of adults agree that \"families with working mothers need grandparents' help more and more\". One in 10 said grandparents have \"little to teach the grandchildren of today\" \u0095 A third of domestic water in England and Wales was used for personal washing, including baths, showers and hand basins. A quarter - between 35 and 45 litres a head a day - was used for flushing the toilet, according to environment agency statistics for 1997-98. \u0095 The proportion of houses fitted with a burglar alarm doubled between 1992 and 2000, from 13% to 26% \u0095 The breeding population of woodpigeons doubled between 1971 and 1999, while great tits, chaffinches and robins were up by at least a quarter. But the population of skylarks, yellowhammers and song thrushes fell by more than half and starlings declined by 65% \u0095 In spring 2000, there were 855,000 people working in IT-related occupations, an increase of 45% in five years. In 1999-00 two in five UK households had a PC - almost three times as many as in 1985",

And press conferences are held at the far end of a very long room, so if you need to make an important announcement you have to wade through miles of luxurious knee-deep carpet.

      "bodyText": "NTL has unveiled ambitious targets in the hope of breaking BSkyB's dominance of the digital TV market. The UK's largest cable company wants to calm investors' nerves over the health of the industry. NTL aims to have 1.25m digital subscribers by the end of 2001, more than doubling its current number of 500,000. This is still far behind BSkyB, which has 4.1m. Close rival ONdigital recently announced it had passed the 1m-subscriber mark. \"This is a good move,\" said Christian Maher, cable analyst at Investec Henderson Crosthwaite. \"NTL is adding more visibility to some of its targets, which are relatively aggressive but still achievable.\" A rise in subscription fees and a cost-cutting spree will help push pre-tax earnings to \u00a3385m this year and to \u00a3825m in 2002. However, pre-tax profits will be some way off in 2005. But NTL's trump card is its ability to offer a combination of TV, internet and telephone services. It already has 2m subscribers to its analogue TV or telephone services in the UK. Despite a debt burden of \u00a38.8bn, analysts remain bullish about the company because it hits its targets and bundling services together could prove lucrative. \"These cable companies still have an innate advantage over BT and BSkyB,\" added Mr Maher. NTL also has \u00a31.45bn left to spend on acquisitions. However, NTL is now expected to concentrate on bedding in the 11 companies it bought last year. Recent stories Jan 24: NTL to ramp up prices",

But what sort of dodgy stuff can you buy over the net these days, and how do you go about finding it? You might be surprised. </p> <p> <strong> Can I buy weapons online?</strong> </p> <p> Yes. Sadly, but rather predictably, the Kalashnikov e-shop website is entirely in Russian, but <a href=\"http://kusa.guns.ru\">Kalashnikov USA Midwest</a> does offer Saiga 420s and plenty more to anyone who has a federal firearms licence on file. The site <a href=\"http://www.milparade.com\">Milparade</a> is selling a subscription to the online version of Russia's Arms 2000 brochure, \"the catalogue of Russian modern export-oriented weapons\", which includes the Tochka modernised tactical missile system and the RPG-7V1 handheld antitank grenade launcher. </p> <p>The internet is packed with sites offering guns, ammo, grenades, knives etc, mostly from US-based companies. The online ordering systems are generally quite primitive - \"Call Jim\", says one - but this may have something to do with the fact that the international shipment of deadly weaponry remains bogged down in legal red tape. </p> <p> <strong> I can buy cheap cigarettes online, though, can't I?</strong> </p> <p> Yes and no. It's perfectly legal to purchase tobacco, but only if UK vat and excise duty has been paid by the seller, which would hardly make it cheap. Without the duty being paid \"the goods are liable to forfeiture by customs at the postal depot\", according to HM customs and excise's spoilsport website. </p> <p> <strong> What about academic work?

      "bodyText": "After the revelation that you can buy twins on the internet, we have perhaps come a step closer to the day when everything will be available online, allowing each of us to purchase our heart's desire without being restricted by tiresome moral implications. But what sort of dodgy stuff can you buy over the net these days, and how do you go about finding it? You might be surprised. Can I buy weapons online? Yes. Sadly, but rather predictably, the Kalashnikov e-shop website is entirely in Russian, but Kalashnikov USA Midwest does offer Saiga 420s and plenty more to anyone who has a federal firearms licence on file. The site Milparade is selling a subscription to the online version of Russia's Arms 2000 brochure, \"the catalogue of Russian modern export-oriented weapons\", which includes the Tochka modernised tactical missile system and the RPG-7V1 handheld antitank grenade launcher. The internet is packed with sites offering guns, ammo, grenades, knives etc, mostly from US-based companies. The online ordering systems are generally quite primitive - \"Call Jim\", says one - but this may have something to do with the fact that the international shipment of deadly weaponry remains bogged down in legal red tape. I can buy cheap cigarettes online, though, can't I? Yes and no. It's perfectly legal to purchase tobacco, but only if UK vat and excise duty has been paid by the seller, which would hardly make it cheap. Without the duty being paid \"the goods are liable to forfeiture by customs at the postal depot\", according to HM customs and excise's spoilsport website. What about academic work? Say I need an essay on Ben Jonson's Volpone \"for reference\" by, say, 2:15 this afternoon? Apart from pornography, this is one of the few areas in which the internet comes into its own.

But sources say Mr Williams will have an interim tenure until new owner Richard Desmond can appoint a long-term successor. It is thought that Northern &amp; Shell have left itself between two and three months to appoint a successor. Among the long list of candidates for the role in the long term, Star editor Peter Hill seems to be current favourite. Another possible internal candidate is thought to be showbusiness editor Robert Jobson, who is believed to have made it clear to Richard Desmond that he is interested in the role. External candidates are thought to include former Mail on Sunday editor Jonathan Holborow and the News of the World's deputy editor Andy Coulson. Mr Williams, the number three at the paper, was today lunching with editorial director Paul Ashford, who was thought to be priming Mr Williams for the job of steadying the Express after the seismic shocks over the past weeks. He was spotted in the canteen with editorial director Paul Ashford and managing editor Lindsay Cook Although many Express journalists were sympathetic to Ms Boycott, one said he was \"relieved\" that the soap opera was over and that journalists were looking forward to \"getting on with their jobs\". Another said: \"Things are surreally normal here. This has been going on for so long, it is an anti-climax. It was fairly emotional when Rosie left, but now people have to get on with it and think about their futures. \"There is also a sense that the redundancies will now start happening.\" Insiders at the paper still believe Star editor Peter Hill will ultimately be made editor. As one source said Mr Desmond needs someone he can trust implicitly. \"He's not going to have anyone writing 'Fuck You Desmond' in the paper anymore,\" the insider said.

      "bodyText": "Chelsea Football Club has clinched a \u00a324m sponsorship tie-up with Emirates Airlines. The deal is the second biggest UK football branding deal in history. Emirates will splash its logo across Chelsea players' shirts for the next four seasons. The airline replaces the team's current sponsor, Autoglass, whose contract expires in the summer. The Dubai-based company will also pay the London club bonuses according to the team's success on the pitch. In addition, Chelsea training staff will coach youngsters in the middle east, where the game is developing fast. The deal may eventually involve an Emirates-branded Chelsea team tour to the region during the close season. The huge sponsorship dwarfs that of rivals Arsenal (Sega) and Leeds (Strongbow) and is not far behind Manchester United's \u00a330m tie-up with Vodafone last year. Chelsea chairman Ken Bates said: \"We are now an international team and an international club so we wanted a more high-profile international partner.\" The Autoglass deal was worth only \u00a31.2m a year to the Blues. Earlier this week, Mr Bates announced a \u00a350m kit supply deal with Umbro. The latest moves, combined with Sky's \u00a340m stake last year, will make Chelsea one of Europe's richest clubs.

      "body": "<p>Peter Mandelson's resignation could not have come at a more sensitive time for Northern Ireland. He was playing a central part in intensive negotiations to revive the dangerously beleaguered peace process.</p> <p>London and Dublin have given themselves just 10 more days to untangle the knots of disagreement which still entangle the pro-peace factions. And while they wrangle, the anti-peace elements - including extreme paramilitary groups - are doing their grisly best to derail the whole process.</p> <p>There is nothing artificial in the latest deadline for peace. The Good Friday agreement, while still alive and breathing, is in intensive care. The power-sharing executive is paralysed, the cross-border institutions have not started to function, and there has been no progress on the vital twin issues of IRA disarmament and British army withdrawal. The peace process, in short, is frozen, and now a new key player is stepping on to the fragile ice.</p> <p>John Reid, the new secretary of state, is well respected in parliament and in Edinburgh, where he has won many friends as a staunchly pro-devolution Scottish secretary. That reputation will travel with him to Belfast, where all parties are united in their distrust of Westminster. Reid also has the asset of personal warmth, being something of a wit and bon viveur.</p> <p>His Scottishness could be a questionable advantage. Scotland has close historical, cultural and political links with Northern Ireland - and a regrettably similar religious divide. Reid was born Catholic, and is a keen Celtic supporter. These things should not matter, but they do. Northern Ireland has never quite grasped the notion of political correctness.</p> <p>The British and Irish governments are wearing a brave smile this morning, as they play down the impact of Mandelson's abrupt departure, and Reid's consequent plunge into the deep end. They are stressing the continuing commitment of both governments to breaking the impasse in Belfast. In London, Tony Blair is fully involved in the talks, with an important secondary role being undertaken by his influential chief of staff, Jonathan Powell. In Dublin, the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and his foreign minister Brian Cowen are also engaged virtually full time on the peace process.</p> <p>The problem, as ever, is in Belfast, where unionists and republicans are still in eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation. Neither side shows any side of blinking over the key issues.</p> <p>The Unionist Party led by first minister David Trimble is adamant that there must be tangible moves towards IRA disarmament before they will loosen their effective veto on cross-border cooperation. Sinn Fein is equally insistent on radical police reform and 'demilitarisation' as preconditions of disarmament.</p> <p>There is an undeniable sense of urgency, as both sovereign governments chip away at the deadlock. But other, more malign elements are also at work. There has been a spate of sectarian pipe-bomb attacks on Catholic homes by extreme loyalist factions. Only last night two men were shot and wounded in paramilitary-style punishments. Dissident republican groups are also stepping up their activities, with a series of bomb and mortar attacks on security forces.</p> <p>There is also looming hiatus of the British general election, in which Northern Ireland candidates will be tempted to retrench their 'no surrender' positions.</p> <p>All in all, it's the worst possible time for a new secretary of state to be taking over at Stormont Castle.</p> <p><b>Full text</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">The resignation speech</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/nireland/\">Northern Ireland</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Mandelson: a career in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">Peter Mandelson announces his resignation (3mins 30)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124white.ra\">Michael White at Westminster (2mins 14)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/  news/politics/0124wainwright.ra\">Martin Wainwright in Hartlepool (3mins 55)</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427850,00.html\">25.01.2001: A glittering career in ruins</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427809,00.html\">25.01.2001: Hague attacks Labour's standards</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427840,00.html\">25.01.2001: Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: the Mandelson I knew</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427702,00.html\">25.01.2001: Hugo Young on the fall of Mandelson</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427669,00.html\">25.01.2001: Roy Greenslade on Mandelson's press relations</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427481,00.html\">24.01.2001: Analysis by Nicholas Watt - Farewell Mandelson, brilliant but unloved</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427605,00.html\">24.01.2001: Mandelson's potential successors</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427491,00.html\">24.01.2001: Fish and sympathy from Mandelson's Hartlepool constituency</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427558,00.html\">24.01.2001, analysis: Resignation upsets pot as Irish stew </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427475,00.html\">24.01.2001: The hands-on Hindujas</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,427264,00.html\">Profile: Srichand Hinduja</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427465,00.html\">24.01.2001: Passport row lands Mandelson in trouble</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,427941,00.html\">Steve Bell on Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e6ee\">Have your say: should Mandelson have quit?</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number-10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageID=3291\" target=\"_new\">Press briefing</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nio.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Northern Ireland Office</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a><br><a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Belfast Telegraph</a></p>",

His Scottishness could be a questionable advantage. Scotland has close historical, cultural and political links with Northern Ireland - and a regrettably similar religious divide. Reid was born Catholic, and is a keen Celtic supporter. These things should not matter, but they do. Northern Ireland has never quite grasped the notion of political correctness. The British and Irish governments are wearing a brave smile this morning, as they play down the impact of Mandelson's abrupt departure, and Reid's consequent plunge into the deep end. They are stressing the continuing commitment of both governments to breaking the impasse in Belfast. In London, Tony Blair is fully involved in the talks, with an important secondary role being undertaken by his influential chief of staff, Jonathan Powell. In Dublin, the Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and his foreign minister Brian Cowen are also engaged virtually full time on the peace process. The problem, as ever, is in Belfast, where unionists and republicans are still in eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation. Neither side shows any side of blinking over the key issues. The Unionist Party led by first minister David Trimble is adamant that there must be tangible moves towards IRA disarmament before they will loosen their effective veto on cross-border cooperation. Sinn Fein is equally insistent on radical police reform and 'demilitarisation' as preconditions of disarmament. There is an undeniable sense of urgency, as both sovereign governments chip away at the deadlock. But other, more malign elements are also at work. There has been a spate of sectarian pipe-bomb attacks on Catholic homes by extreme loyalist factions. Only last night two men were shot and wounded in paramilitary-style punishments. Dissident republican groups are also stepping up their activities, with a series of bomb and mortar attacks on security forces. There is also looming hiatus of the British general election, in which Northern Ireland candidates will be tempted to retrench their 'no surrender' positions. All in all, it's the worst possible time for a new secretary of state to be taking over at Stormont Castle.

      "bodyText": "The latest American film star heading for a West End stage debut has left it rather late: Farley Granger, best known for Alfred Hitchcock's 1948 and 1951 classics, Rope, and Strangers on a Train, is coming to London next month at the age of 72. He will appear in Semi-Monde, a Noel Coward play written in 1926, but regarded as so shocking that it has never been staged in England. The play was banned by the lord chamberlain in 1926, but was never staged even after theatre censorship was lifted in 1968 partly because of the vast cast. Coward wrote it for 37 actors, but producer Thelma Holt has ruthlessly pruned it and got it down to a cast of 28. Star gazers will have to look hard at the programme to spot Mr Farley's name.

And its increasingly multilingual character has been the most notable change since it started out as a totally English medium. </p> <p>For many people the language of the internet is English. \"World, Wide, Web: three English words\" was the headline of a piece by Michael Specter in the New York Times a few years ago. The article went on to comment: \"If you want to take full advantage of the internet there is only one real way to do it: learn English.\" Specter did acknowledge the arrival of other languages: \"As the Web grows, the number of people on it who speak French, say, or Russian will become more varied and that variety will be expressed on the Web. That is why it is a fundamentally democratic technology. But it won't necessarily happen soon.\" </p> <p>The evidence is growing that this conclusion was wrong. With the internet's globalisation the presence of other languages has steadily risen. By the mid-90s a widely quoted figure was that about 80% of the Net was in English - a figure supported by the first big study of language distribution on the internet, carried out in 1997 by Babel, a joint initiative of the Internet Society and Alis Technologies. This showed English well ahead, but with several other languages - notably German, Japanese, French and Spanish - entering the ring. </p> <p>Since then the estimates for English have been falling, with some commentators predicting that before long the Web (and the internet as a whole) will be predominantly non-English, as communications infrastructure develops in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America. A Global Reach survey has estimated that people with internet access in non-English-speaking countries increased from 7m to 136m between 1995 and 2000. In 1998 the total number of new non-English websites passed the number of new English websites. </p> <p>At a conference on search engine strategies last April, Alta Vista was predicting that by next year less than half of the Web would be in English. English-language author David Graddol has predicted an even lower figure in due course, 40%. In parts of the world the local language is already dominant. According to the Japanese internet author Yoshi Mikami, 90% of Web pages in Japan are now in Japanese. </p> <p>The Web is increasingly reflecting the distribution of language presence in the real world, and many sites provide the evidence. They range from individual businesses doing their best to present a multilingual identity to big sites collecting data on many languages. Under the first heading we encounter such newspapers as the Belgian daily Le Soir, which is represented by six languages - French, Dutch, English, German, Italian and Spanish. Under the latter heading we find such sites as the University of Oregon Font Archive, providing 112 fonts in its archives for more than 40 languages. </p> <p>A World Language Resources site lists products for 728 languages. An African resource list covers several local languages; Yoruba, for example, is illustrated by some 5,000 words, along with proverbs, naming patterns and greetings. Another site deals with 87 European minority languages. Some sites are small in content, but extensive in range: one gives the Lord's Prayer in nearly 500 languages. Nobody has yet worked out just how many languages have obtained a modicum of presence on the Web. I have found more than 1,000. It is not difficult to find evidence of a Net presence for the vast majority of the more frequently used languages, and for a large number of minority languages too. I would guess that about a quarter of the world's languages have some sort of internet presence. </p> <p>In all these examples we are encountering language presence in a real sense. These are not sites that only analyse or talk about languages; they allow us to see languages as they are. In many cases, the total Web presence, in terms of number of pages, is small. The crucial point is that the languages are out there, even if represented by only a sprinkling of sites. It is the ideal medium for minority languages, given the relative cheapness and ease of creating a Web page, compared with the costs of print, TV or radio. </p> <p>However, developing a significant cyber-presence is not easy. Until a critical mass of internet penetration in a country builds up, and a corresponding mass of content exists in the local language, the motivation to switch from English-language sites will be limited to those for whom issues of identity outweigh issues of information. The future is also dependent on the levels of English-speaking ability in individual countries, and the further growth in those levels. There are also practical problems, though a great deal has been done since the mid-90s to address them. First, the Ascii character set still fails to adequately support the array of letter shapes in Arabic, Hindi, Chinese, Korean and the many other languages in the world that do not use the Latin alphabet. The Unicode coding system, the alternative to Ascii, allows more than 65,000 characters; but the implementation of this system is still in its infancy. The Web consortium has an internationalisation activity looking specifically at different alphabets, so that operating systems can support a page in any alphabet. </p> <p>The future looks good for Web multilingualism. As Ned Thomas commented last year in an editorial for Contact, the bulletin of the European Bureau of Lesser Used Languages: \"It is not the case . . . that all languages will be marginalised on the Net by English. On the contrary, there will be a great demand for multilingual websites, for multilingual data retrieval, for machine translation, for voice recognition systems to be multilingual.\" </p> <p>And Tyler Chambers, the creator of various Web language projects, agrees: \"The future of the internet is even more multilingualism and cross-cultural exploration and understanding than we've already seen.\" I agree.

Then again, not one departing secretary of state, from Willie Whitelaw to Mo Mowlam, has ever left with paeans of praise ringing in their ears.</p> <p>Unionists tend to view the occupants of Hillsborough Castle as impatient gravediggers for the Union. Nationalists and republicans dislike whoever represents Her Majesty's Government in the six counties because that is their role in the game. As Gerry Adams said to Mandelson after the suspension of the Northern Ireland Executive last febuary, \"we're going to dump all over you, but don't worry. It's nothing personal.\"</p> <p>That said, Mandelson probably won't miss the plain speaking folk of Ulster either, despite his earnest wish to continue \"to play a part in the peace process.\"</p> <p>At one of the last shindigs he threw at Hillsborough Castle, one of his three official residences as secretary of state, he was asked what he thought about Northern Ireland. He stroked his chin and stared into the middle distance for a moment, before opining \"odd, very odd.\" Then he exited in pursuit of a journalist whose copy was, he made clear, in urgent need of a rapid rebuttal.</p> <p>Another drawback for the glamour-loving ex-SoS is the lack of cosmopolitan glitter among the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone, despite the existence of a very prosperous minority who live along the 'Gold Coast' of North Down and the Hampstead-like suburbs of south Belfast.</p> <p>He did, however, find some entertainment among a small media-celebrity clique which surround the ebullient personality of Sean Rafferty, the BBC Radio 3 presenter.

      "bodyText": "Peter Mandelson's demise has caused few tears to flow among the political class in Northern Ireland. Then again, not one departing secretary of state, from Willie Whitelaw to Mo Mowlam, has ever left with paeans of praise ringing in their ears. Unionists tend to view the occupants of Hillsborough Castle as impatient gravediggers for the Union. Nationalists and republicans dislike whoever represents Her Majesty's Government in the six counties because that is their role in the game. As Gerry Adams said to Mandelson after the suspension of the Northern Ireland Executive last febuary, \"we're going to dump all over you, but don't worry. It's nothing personal.\" That said, Mandelson probably won't miss the plain speaking folk of Ulster either, despite his earnest wish to continue \"to play a part in the peace process.\" At one of the last shindigs he threw at Hillsborough Castle, one of his three official residences as secretary of state, he was asked what he thought about Northern Ireland. He stroked his chin and stared into the middle distance for a moment, before opining \"odd, very odd.\" Then he exited in pursuit of a journalist whose copy was, he made clear, in urgent need of a rapid rebuttal. Another drawback for the glamour-loving ex-SoS is the lack of cosmopolitan glitter among the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone, despite the existence of a very prosperous minority who live along the 'Gold Coast' of North Down and the Hampstead-like suburbs of south Belfast. He did, however, find some entertainment among a small media-celebrity clique which surround the ebullient personality of Sean Rafferty, the BBC Radio 3 presenter. Mandelson and his companion, Mr de Silva, were occasional guests at Rafferty's immodestly described 'cottage' in Donegal, across the border and away from the prim and prying eyes of the Free Presbyterians of Belfast. Despite the public priggishness of many unionist politicians, Mandelson's sexuality was always a muted issue. The only time homophobic remarks were hurled in his direction was when he accompanied David Trimble to the 'Orange Citadel' of Portadown, where both spoke in favour of the Good Friday Agreement. The local Drumcree Orangemen were not amused. \"Homo!\" they screamed at Mandelson. \"Traitor!\" they screamed at Trimble, as both men ran to their armour-plated car through a cordon of RUC riot police. One of Trimble's aides later said that they had \"never seen such a look of fear in their lives, as Peter Mandelson had that night\". Speaking in Westminster at the last Northern Ireland Question Time of the Mandelson dispensation, Trimble made a point of saying that unionists \"appreciate the effort he has made\" in Northern Ireland, before adding the obligatory point about the \"hurt\" caused by the Police Bill, reforming and renaming the RUC. On the surface, not very warm praise from the First Minister, yet unionists are smarting. They would have greeted anybody as a potential friend after the Mo Mowlam experience, whose touchy-feely manner embarrassed and annoyed them. \"He was not Mo\", said one unionist close to Trimble, when asked to list Mandy's virtues. \"He marked a real change in tone. He didn't hug ex-terrorists. He was sound on the Police Bill, although we didn't get exactly what we wanted. His first stop in Ulster was to a victim's group in south Belfast. He stood up to the nationalists, the Irish government and the Americans over suspension in Febuary 2000.\" Indeed, Trimble had actively lobbied Blair for Mandelson to replace Mowlam. It is unclear if they thought that he was an instinctive unionist, but older unionists fondly remember his grandfather, Herbert Morrison, who passionately defended the unionist cause during a mini-crisis in 1949 when the Irish Free State declared itself to be the Republic of Ireland. Nationalists, in the zero-sum manner of Northern politics, will feel a warm glow. They were as offended by Mandelson's patrician manner as unionists were by Mo's feet on her office desk. Many agreed with the term \"our Proconsul\", coined by Brian Feeney in his Irish News column. One said he was \"more tory than Sir Patrick Mayhew\". In the aftermath of the suspension of the Executive, Gerry Adams stormed out of a meeting shouting \"don't patronise us!\", and the Irish government's spin doctors expressed concern that the SoS spent too much of his time on the phone to London, briefing his favourite lobby correspondents. Another constituency offended by Mandelson was the Israeli government. In late Febuary 2000, he left the tattered peace process in Ulster to see how they did things in the Middle East. According to the Israelis, Mandelson spent a couple of hours chatting with their negotiators, before disappearing for three hours to bask in the Dead Sea. In the end, he could float in the Dead Sea, but could not walk on water.

Nowadays there's ... well, Philip Seymour Hoffman and William H Macy are certainly two of the finest actors working today, but they're hardly the epitome of cool. </p> <p>There's George Clooney, perhaps - the Clooney of Out of Sight, Three Kings and O Brother Where Art Thou?, not of Batman &amp; Robin. There's the Brad Pitt of Fight Club. Sean Penn and Johnny Depp in pretty much everything. And then there's Benicio Del Toro, who has just won a Golden Globe as best supporting actor in Steven Soderbergh's new movie, Traffic. </p> <p>His very name seems to inspire reverence from his colleagues. For Brad Pitt, Del Toro's co-star in Guy Ritchie's gangster movie Snatch, \"he is about as good as they come. You'll see that in Traffic. He is amazing.\" </p> <p>\"He's very cool,\" agrees Taye Diggs, who worked alongside him in Christopher McQuarrie's modern western The Way of the Gun. \"I was watching him work, just stealing from him, waiting for the opportunity to play a character like that, where I can use his subtleties and what he does with his eyes and his furrowed brow. He's something else.\" </p> <p>Indeed. While many will remember Del Toro mainly for his hilarious performance as the mumbling, mercurial Latino hood in The Usual Suspects, the Puerto Rican-born actor's star has been rising steadily, with a series of show-stealing character parts in films such as Basquiat and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, culminating in his role as a desperately honest small-town Mexican cop in Traffic. </p> <p>A lengthy, labyrinthine drama adapted from the BBC TV series Traffik, it follows the drugs trade across the US-Mexico border and its effects on both communities. Traffic also stars Michael Douglas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Don Cheadle and Dennis Quaid, and, typically for Soderbergh, there's not one bad performance in it. But Del Toro manages to out-act them all, mostly in Spanish. </p> <p>\"My character is trying to do the right thing, and little by little comes to realise everything is corrupted and he's got to dance with situations,\" begins Del Toro over lunch in a Beverly Hills restaurant. Dressed in a baggy Lon Chaney Jr T-shirt, dark jeans and a black-and-white cap jammed down over unruly black hair, he looks more like a truck driver than a movie star. </p> <p>\"He starts to get a little corrupted but fights it. He wants to do the right thing. That's what's unique. Usually the Latin guy is the bad guy. And working with Steven is quite an experience. He's the coolest director I've ever met. He allows your creativity to flourish. He encourages.\" </p> <p>Born in Puerto Rico in 1967, Del Toro moved to Pennsylvania with his lawyer father when he was 12, after the death of his mother. \"One of the reasons moving for me wasn't so traumatic was that I wanted to see the Stones' Tattoo You tour,\" says Del Toro, who had grown up listening to the Beatles, the Stones and the Who. Filming Snatch, he says, allowed him to catch up on the British music scene. \"I rediscovered the Jam. I knew them a bit from high school but I was more of a Clash guy.\" </p> <p>After a year studying business at the University of California, he went to drama school in New York, before training with Method master Stella Adler in Los Angeles. He made his film debut as Duke the Dog-Faced Boy in Randal Kleiser's Big Top Pee-Wee, and popped up in the Bond movie The Living Daylights as well as on TV playing various drug lords. Later films included Sean Penn's directorial debut The Indian Runner, Peter Weir's underrated Fearless, and George Huang's Hollywood satire Swimming With Sharks. </p> <p>But it wasn't until Bryan Singer cast him as the unintelligible Fred Fenster in The Usual Suspects that Hollywood really noticed him. Not that Del Toro thought Singer's movie would amount to much. \"When I finished my last day of shooting I was driving home and I went, 'What the fuck have I done, doing this fucking stupid character in this stupid fucking movie? It's over.' We didn't know. Honestly, I read the script one time and it didn't make any goddamn ... the names, this and that, but it worked pretty good, yeah.\" </p> <p>The Usual Suspects won Oscars for writer Christopher McQuarrie and for Kevin Spacey as best supporting actor, and suddenly people started taking more notice of this quirky looking, quirky sounding guy. There were roles in Abel Ferrara's The Funeral and The Fan, in which he got stabbed by a psychotic Robert De Niro, before he landed his first lead as a car thief opposite Alicia Silverstone in Marco Brambilla's kidnap comedy Excess Baggage - though the less said about that the better. </p> <p>Not so Terry Gilliam's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which saw him play Gonzo to Johnny Depp's Hunter S Thompson. That movie was a trip in more ways than one, but proved a bit too odd for most audiences. \"I'm a master of movies that have life in video,\" he says with a laugh. \"They come out, they don't work and eventually in video everyone goes, 'Oh yeah, it's good.' Like Fear and Loathing, which, little by little, has picked up a crowd.\" </p> <p>Del Toro's next starring role is in Basic, directed by Lee Tamahori, but he wants to be more than an actor. \"I've been writing a little bit,\" he says. \"I've got a couple of things on the shelf.\" </p> <p>Del Toro has already written and directed a short film, Submission, starring Matthew McConaughey, and eventually he wants to try his hand at a feature. If he wasn't working, he'd like to hang out on the set of Soderbergh's next movie, Ocean's Eleven, and learn from the best. \"I did ask Steven if I could come. I want to learn how fast he goes. I'd like to learn about the lenses and the camera. And he's so unpretentious. I really like his attitude.\" </p> <p>The word is that Del Toro is a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination for Traffic. \"Yeah. Great. Can't wait,\" he says. \"I've been doing films now for a while and I've been trying to do my best in every film I've done. It would be great, the recognition. It would great for options I would get if it happens. But if it doesn't, it's not going to change anything.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Traffic is released tomorrow.</p>",

Although many cities in the world have followed suit, including Hong Kong and some in China itself, Chinatown residents have found it difficult to replace the traditional way of banishing demons and bringing good luck. \"Without firecrackers,\" says Mr Lui, the head of the Better Chinatown Association, \"It just doesn't really feel like New Year.\"</p> <p>Matters have been made even worse this year for America's largest Chinese population. The state's board of education scheduled the all-important English Regents exam - a requisite for high-school graduation - for yesterday and today.</p> <p>At a time when teenagers should be enjoying lion dances and receiving red envelopes full of money, they will be trapped in an examination room for six hours.</p> <p>Some young students have promised to circulate a petition of protest - after the exam. For its part, the board of education has blamed the changeable nature of the lunar year. New Year's Day can fall at any time during a two-week period.</p> <p>Mr Lui, an ebullient man who founded the Chinatown association last year to try to improve conditions for the area's estimated 100,000-strong population, is unabashed by this latest assault on his traditions. This year, for the second time ever, he has helped organise an American-style parade to take place this weekend throughout the area's two-square miles.</p> <p>More than 100 people are expected to join a procession of floats and marching bands. There will be traditional lion dancers for good fortune and many citizens dressed as Monkey Kings.</p> <p>The only difference between this year and last will be the absence of \"mock firecrackers\", as the manufactured pretence cost the association $20,000 last year and \"didn't make people feel the same\", according to Mr Lui.</p> <p>\"We have tried to make it a New York tradition for Chinese New Year,\" he says. \"Everyone can come. We have been trying to use it, not just to celebrate, but to make people realise that a lot of things can be done together.\"</p> <p>The association has even reached out to different ethnic groups, he says, and expects to see many American parents of adopted Chinese children participating.</p> <p>While public displays of revelry have been Americanised into a televised parade, other traditions have remained the same as they were in China. Restaurants served a range of special New Year dishes to celebrate the Year of the Snake this week as well as the staples of good fortune. Such superstitions seemed particularly apposite this year. The last Year of the Snake was in 1989, the year of Tiananmen Square and another Bush inauguration.</p> <p>Food came round (for wholeness and prosperity) and in red, gold and green (for luck and prosperity). Dishes included the brown seaweed called far chai, which rhymes with \"get rich\" and looks like hair as well as lotus roots, \"lin ngau\", eaten because it sounds like \"lin yau\", which means abundance.</p> <p>Ordinary meals, like tofu fried in an oblong shape, are also given special lucky names at this time of year to suggest good fortune. The tofu is called \"golden bricks\" because they look like gold.</p> <p>The Chinese also have a traditional greeting at New Year, which is perfect for the centre of mammon that is Manhattan. \"Gung hay fat choy,\" they say, which roughly means \"wishing you lots of money\".</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:jane.martinson@theguardian.com\">jane.martinson@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush/\">Special report: George W Bush's America</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/US_election_race/\">US election race</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/usguns/\">Gun violence in America</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28jane+martinson%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=jane+martinson&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Jane Martinson</a></p> <p><b>Useful links </b><br> <a href=\"http://www.nyc.gov/\" target=\"_new\">NYC.gov</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.nytimes.com/\" target=\"_new\">New York Times</a><br> <a href=\" http://www.nydailynews.com/\" target=\"_new\">New York Daily News</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.villagevoice.com/\" target=\"_new\">Village Voice</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.twcnyc.com/\" target=\"_new\">TV: Time Warner New York</a></p>",

This year, for the second time ever, he has helped organise an American-style parade to take place this weekend throughout the area's two-square miles. More than 100 people are expected to join a procession of floats and marching bands. There will be traditional lion dancers for good fortune and many citizens dressed as Monkey Kings. The only difference between this year and last will be the absence of \"mock firecrackers\", as the manufactured pretence cost the association $20,000 last year and \"didn't make people feel the same\", according to Mr Lui. \"We have tried to make it a New York tradition for Chinese New Year,\" he says. \"Everyone can come. We have been trying to use it, not just to celebrate, but to make people realise that a lot of things can be done together.\" The association has even reached out to different ethnic groups, he says, and expects to see many American parents of adopted Chinese children participating. While public displays of revelry have been Americanised into a televised parade, other traditions have remained the same as they were in China. Restaurants served a range of special New Year dishes to celebrate the Year of the Snake this week as well as the staples of good fortune. Such superstitions seemed particularly apposite this year. The last Year of the Snake was in 1989, the year of Tiananmen Square and another Bush inauguration. Food came round (for wholeness and prosperity) and in red, gold and green (for luck and prosperity). Dishes included the brown seaweed called far chai, which rhymes with \"get rich\" and looks like hair as well as lotus roots, \"lin ngau\", eaten because it sounds like \"lin yau\", which means abundance. Ordinary meals, like tofu fried in an oblong shape, are also given special lucky names at this time of year to suggest good fortune. The tofu is called \"golden bricks\" because they look like gold. The Chinese also have a traditional greeting at New Year, which is perfect for the centre of mammon that is Manhattan. \"Gung hay fat choy,\" they say, which roughly means \"wishing you lots of money\".

      "bodyText": "The departure from the Express of Fleet Street's Renaissance Woman is likely to mark the end of the paper's flirtation with the liberal left. In an age when every editor should be able to wax as lyrically on the consumer habits of young men as on the Kosovo crisis, Rosie Boycott's credentials were impeccable. Like a fusion of Polly Toynbee and Marianne Faithful, Rosie Boycott was a fully-paid up scourge of the right, but with a soft edge. A typical member of what William Hague would call the \"liberal elite\", she nevertheless had the humour and humility to avoid smugness. She has made her biggest splashes with \"conscience\" campaigns such as her bid while at the Independent to raise the tone of the cannabis debate. And at the Express her staff won awards for their successful campaign to stop the deportation of Ben James, a Nigerian-born commodities broker. The Express was also the first paper to turn on Blair's government for a 75p increase in state pensions, with an excoriating splash illustrated with a packet of peanuts. And she was the first to throw the spotlight on the famine in Sudan in 1998. Her year at the Independent, however, will be remembered chiefly for the notorious campaign to legalise cannabis which culminated in a march to Trafalgar Square and earned her the Guardian diary sobriquet of 'Rizla Rosie'. Likewise, her championing of the cause of the Express staff who faced sacking under Richard Desmond won plaudits with those who feared that the business of media and social responsibility were mutually exclusive. It is a sense that these campaigns are based on genuine motives that has allowed her to be forgiven for gaffes such as the Channel 4 fly-on-the-wall documentary Independent Rosie, and what critics on the right saw as the over-zealous trendiness of the cannabis campaign. Since she co-founded the feminist Spare Rib magazine in 1971, Ms Boycott has continued to champion women's rights, even as editor of men's glossy Esquire (for which she won an editor of the year award). But she would rather be recognised for her journalism and her management skills and her genuine interest in social affairs. That said, her ability to wear her heart on her sleeve is as legendary as her frankness over her youthful battles with alcohol and drug addiction. She famously burst into tears at a news conference upon hearing of the death of the veteran war correspondent Martha Gellhorn and cried like a grieving mother when the Express was taken over by Mr Desmond. However, she has not been without her critics. Her harsh email to Richard Desmond over the \"heavy-handed\" sacking of staff led to accusations, albeit whispered, of hypocrisy at the helm - but in the present climate of fear, everyone is ultimately on Rosie's side.

      "bodyText": "ITV's decision to delay its News at Ten by half-an-hour on the biggest news day of the year turned into a minor ratings disaster last night. After two successive ratings victories, Sir Trevor McDonald's bulletin was forced to take second place to the BBC. It was toppled in the ratings by the BBC's Ten O'Clock News on a day that News at Ten actually went out at 10.30pm. Some 5.6m viewers - a 27% share of the audience - tuned into the BBC's coverage of the dramatic resignation of Peter Mandelson, according to unofficial overnights. ITV News at Ten drew 4.5m half-an-hour later, but could still claim an audience share victory, with 28% of viewers at that time. However, the fact the BBC won more viewers has fuelled the corporation's public relations slogan that ITV will confuse and lose viewers with its \"News at When\". The ITV news was pushed later because the broadcaster had scheduled a 90-minute edition of drama The Vice from 9pm. As part of the deal thrashed out with the Independent Television Commission in September for the return of News at Ten, ITV only signed up to run the news at 10pm on three weekday nights between Monday and Thursday. The Vice drew 7.2m and a 33% share. The BBC1 Ten O'Clock News inherited a 6.5m audience and a 29% share from Crimewatch UK. The BBC claimed official Barb figures will show the audience for last night's News at Ten will actually be nearer 4m. A spokesman said the ITV news did not start last night until 10.34pm, so the overnight figure of 4.5m will have included some of the audience for The Vice. But ITV conceded that \"because their bulletin was first on, the BBC benefited from the extremely busy news day\". The figures also appear to support Peter Sissons's arguments that the ratings for the news are directly related to the audience levels for programme before. The Vice on ITV was down from 8.4m last Wed to 7.2m this week. Castaway was 4.7 on BBC1 last week and a strong Crimewatch did 6.5m on that slot last night.",

But that's different. </p> <p>That 1927 win is the major achievement, although personally I was not around to see it. My high points have been watching the club gain various promotions and play in Europe. But this season, to talk to and meet Sam Hammam, and see the changes going on at my club, will take some beating.</p> <p><strong>The low points</strong></p> <p>As with any other football club, it's relegation. There have been times over the years when unscrupulous chairman have led the club into danger, but we've always bounced back. Last season we were relegated.

      "bodyText": "What makes us so special Cardiff City is unique and our potential is massive. There's no Premiership club for over 100 miles and over a million people live within a 30-minute drive of the ground. The high points The club's high point is the 1927 FA Cup final. Cardiff City 1 - 0 Arsenal remains the only time the trophy has left England. Until this year, of course, when Cardiff hosts the final at the Millennium Stadium. But that's different. That 1927 win is the major achievement, although personally I was not around to see it. My high points have been watching the club gain various promotions and play in Europe. But this season, to talk to and meet Sam Hammam, and see the changes going on at my club, will take some beating. The low points As with any other football club, it's relegation. There have been times over the years when unscrupulous chairman have led the club into danger, but we've always bounced back. Last season we were relegated. That still hurts as it was not so long ago. How we're doing at the moment The whole place is buzzing. We're winning games and scoring goals for fun.

Their money will also buy them a \"scholarship scheme\" with the club, allowing Dubai youngsters to receive training from Chelsea coaching staff. \"It is not just about shirt sponsorship, there is a lot more to it than that,\" Bates said. The deal is also thought to include additional performance-related bonuses for the club. Manchester United set the record for sponsorship last summer when they signed a four-year contract with Vodafone estimated to be worth between \u00a330m and \u00a350m.",

Her deputy Chris Blackhurst has also quit. They left the Express Ludgate House HQ at 11.20am after almost three years at the helm. It is believed Ms Boycott leaves with a \u00a3200,000 plus pay-off - equivalent to 15 months salary. The deal was finally agreed yesterday after almost two months of brinkmanship with Mr Desmond. It was widely accepted that Ms Boycott, a liberal supporting feminist, would quit following Mr Desmond's arrival because her views were incompatible with a proprietor whose publishing empire included 38 soft porn magazines, including Asian Babes and Big Ones. However, she held out, partly to protect up to 100 journalists who were threatened with the sack, and partly to force Mr Desmond to honour her contract which ran until May 2002. In December relations between Mr Desmond and Ms Boycott worsened when 60 support staff were made redundant. In a letter distributed to staff, Ms Boycott condemned \"heavy-handed\" treatment of workers. She expressed outrage that management had sacked a pregnant woman as well as a disabled man who had been promised a job for life. At that stage a number of journalists had already left in protest at the changes. Columnist Peter Hitchens and political editor Anthony Bevins were among those who quit because they would not work for the new owner.

Adapted from a short story by the late Andre Dubus, the film, which marks the directing debut of Field, is an elegant human drama which traces a wealthy New England family's tumble into tragedy. In the Bedroom stars Sissie Spacek, Marisa Tomei and Britain's Tom Wilkinson.

Scripted by John Scott Shepherd and Dana Stevens, the film tells the tale of a thrusting female journalist who is forced to take stock when she is told by a homeless psychic that she has only one week left to live. Life continues Schumacher's shift towards more intimate, low-budget movies after the failure of his mega-budget Batman and Robin. Last year he attracted decent reviews for his odd-couple drama Flawless and his guerilla-style boot-camp saga Tigerland (released in the UK in March) is tipped to be his best film to date.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 The jingle of another sale enlivened an otherwise sluggish Sundance International Film Festival (see earlier story) as Miramax opened their chequebooks to purchase the distribution rights to Todd Fields' In the Bedroom (pictured) for a reported $2m (\u00a31.37m). Adapted from a short story by the late Andre Dubus, the film, which marks the directing debut of Field, is an elegant human drama which traces a wealthy New England family's tumble into tragedy. In the Bedroom stars Sissie Spacek, Marisa Tomei and Britain's Tom Wilkinson. Miramax are believed to be planning to push the film as an Oscar hopeful. \u0095 Joel Schumacher is to direct the romantic comedy, Life, or Something Like It, for New Regency Pictures. Scripted by John Scott Shepherd and Dana Stevens, the film tells the tale of a thrusting female journalist who is forced to take stock when she is told by a homeless psychic that she has only one week left to live. Life continues Schumacher's shift towards more intimate, low-budget movies after the failure of his mega-budget Batman and Robin. Last year he attracted decent reviews for his odd-couple drama Flawless and his guerilla-style boot-camp saga Tigerland (released in the UK in March) is tipped to be his best film to date. Life, or Something Like It begins production in April.",

      "bodyText": "Just three weeks into the new millennium, Japan already seems to have entered into a darkly apocalyptic mood. The newspapers are full of political scandal, Tokyo stock prices have slumped on fears of recession and economists are warning that the country could face a financial crisis in March. And as if that was not enough to satisfy the doomsayers, the word is now going round that Mt Fuji, the symbol of Japanese serenity, may be about to blow its top. Rumours about an imminent eruption of the long dormant volcano have spread since signs of heightened magma activity under the mountain were reported late last year. On average, 10 low frequencies tremors are detected deep below Mt Fuji annually. But according to the national meteorological agency, this pattern changed dramatically in the autumn with 33 minor quakes detected in September, 133 in October and 222 in November. Scientists say this increase does not mean Mt Fuji will explode into life any time soon, but they acknowledge that the change merits close attention. Their caution is understandable after a year of intense subterranean movement that is unusual even for Japan, a land that is wrinkled by more earthquakes and pimpled with more volcanoes than almost any other nation on earth. In the past 12 months, the archipelago has experienced three major eruptions and several large earthquakes, including a trembler in Tottori, western Japan, that registered 7.3 on the Richter scale, making it bigger than the Kobe quake that killed more than 6,000 people in 1995. Seismology and vulcanology are notoriously imprecise sciences, but many experts in these fields say Japan could be entering a period of heightened seismic activity. Such vague warnings along with the stirrings nine miles below Mt Fuji have been enough to prompt the weekly tabloids to raise the prospect of a devastating eruption that could threaten the 12m inhabitants of Tokyo, which sits 60 miles from the mountain's slopes. It has also prompted the local authorities around the mountain to conduct their first disaster prevention drills and to draw up hazard maps of the areas that would be most vulnerable to pyroclastic flows of molten rock and gas. Such precautions represent a breakthrough. Until now, municipal officials have refused to recognise the possibility of an eruption for fear that it would damage the lucrative Mt Fuji tourist trade. Rising 3,776 metres (12,388ft) from sea level in a nearly perfect cone, Mt Fuji is not only Japan's tallest and most beautiful mountain, it is also a national symbol and an object of worship. During the two month climbing season each summer, about 150,000 pilgrims and sightseers make the four and a half hour trek up the mountain's ash-grey slopes to a peak that is home to numerous Shinto shrines as well as a vending machine for soft drinks. For most visitors, the main concern is the rubbish that has piled up on the mountain's slopes rather than the possibility of an eruption. Mt Fuji has not blown its top since 1707, when it devastated surrounding villages and rained ash on Tokyo for two weeks. But every few years - usually after an eruption elsewhere in Japan - there are warnings that Fuji will be the next to go. The most apocalyptic scenario was painted in the 1984 bestseller, \"The Great Explosion of Mt Fuji\", which predicted that an eruption would trigger a massive earthquake in Tokyo, similar to the one that killed 140,000 people in 1923. That book was blamed for a 10% fall in tourist numbers in the Fuji area the following year, which makes the move to stage a drill this summer seem all the braver. The decision appears to reflect an important change in attitude towards disaster preparation in Japan. Despite the fact that the earth is rarely still in this part of the world, the authorities have often been criticised in the past for taking an overly rosy view of the likelihood and potential impact of natural calamities. But that certainly was not the case last year, when the government acted quickly and effectively to prevent a single volcano or earthquake fatality. In this sense at least, it would seem that the growing tendency to assume the worst is proving to be one of the best things to have happened to Japan in years.

They are calling on the UK's employers to start treating staff more fairly, by cutting back on long hours and stop bosses bullying workers. One of the UK's largest income protection insurers, Unum, says its claims for stress have risen by 88% over the last seven years, while those for chronic fatigue syndrome are up by 40%. Unum was responding to a recent survey from BMRB International among 1,200 full and part time workers which found two thirds of them were stressed, with some 73% admitting it was affecting their performance.

Other income protection insurers such as Royal &amp; SunAlliance and Norwich Union also say they have been hit by increased levels of claims for stress. The annual cost of stress-related sickness to British business is now more than \u00a34billion, according to Professor Cary Cooper, Bupa professor of organisational psychology and health at University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist). Professor Cooper warns that stress levels in Britain are higher than in any other country in Europe and that they will increase rapidly in the next decade. Although some private medical insurance policies will pay for psychiatric treatment for stress problems, those off work for long periods need to have been covered by income protection.

The twist is another complication for Mr Justice Kirkwood, the high court judge who took over the case last Tuesday. He has promised a decision soon on the twins' future. Allan Levy QC, a child law expert, said the real father might emerge as the right person to give them a home. \"If he's the natural father and he's OK, the sooner they go there the better.\" Ms Wecker said on Tuesday that she wanted the babies back. \"I have a job. I have family and friends that will help me take care of my children,\" she said. \"I miss my girls very much.\" Audio report 23.01.2001: Helen Carter at the high court Related articles 24.01.2001: 'Internet twins' to stay in care 24.01.2001: Judgment Days: Joanna Moorhead on perfect parents 24.01.2001: Where did the parents go wrong?

      "bodyText": "The Independent's arts and media correspondent, JoJo Moyes, has clinched a \u00a3200,000-plus deal to write two novels. Publisher Hodder &amp; Stoughton won a six-way bidding battle for the deal, which was based on an unfinished manuscript for her first novel. Ms Moyes, 31, is currently on maternity leave but managed to write four chapters of the first book, which goes by the working title A Temporal Kingdom, in her spare time. The story centres on three generations of women and starts off in post-war colonial Hong Kong, but finishes in County Wexford in Ireland where the grandmother settles. \"It was quite unusual to have six publishers bidding for it but one of the reasons they went for this was because it broke the mould,\" said her agent Jo Frank. \"Although JoJo is a young author, this is not 'chick lit', it is not another Bridget Jones. This is good old fashioned story-telling. It was fresh and different,\" she added. The five other publishers who bid were Viking, Random House, Little Brown, Simon &amp; Schuster and Macmillan. Ms Moyes's deal will be the envy of her colleagues in the media world, many of whom aspire to be novelists. However, she said it was a labour of love and that the money, ultimately, would simply represent a decent salary over the next few years. She has a three-year-old daughter but tried to squeeze an hour of writing in every night after returning from work, sorting out supper and bedtime for her child. \"I had already written three unpublished novels and had really resigned myself to being the 'Eddie the eagle' of publishing. \"I didn't just dash something out and win the lottery. This was a six-year slog,\" she said. She added: \"My good luck was to have written an old-fashioned saga at the right time, but there are still plenty of manuscripts under me bed.\" She is due to complete her first novel in March with publication date set for spring 2001.",

Now that he has bowed out of designing the less expensive YSL ready to wear line, the haute couture catwalk is the last remaining showcase for the veteran designer's creations.</p> <p>Yesterday it was used to full effect as a masterclass in blue-blooded Parisian style. This, the last catwalk show of the week, was haute couture as it was meant to be seen. The salon was laden with chandeliers and lined with delicate gilt chairs, the scent of lilies hung heavy in the air, the vulgar trill of mobile phones was muted by strict decree.</p> <p>First came a series of suits, in every shade of grey from mother of pearl to charcoal. The parallel lines of the sharp-shouldered jackets and wide-brimmed hats, and the seemingly endless legs of high-waisted trousers, were as impossibly elegant as fashion illustrations brought to life.</p> <p>Pale leather gloves and shiny belts gave an old-fashioned polish to the collection - the Yves Saint Laurent couture client would not dream of leaving the house without earrings, let alone consider customising her handbag or wearing pink fishnet tights.</p> <p>For a designer renowned for bringing the influence of menswear into women's wardrobes, this was a very curvy collection.

      "bodyText": "Yves Saint Laurent was a fashion grand master long before most of the industry's current high flyers could tie their shoelaces. Now that he has bowed out of designing the less expensive YSL ready to wear line, the haute couture catwalk is the last remaining showcase for the veteran designer's creations. Yesterday it was used to full effect as a masterclass in blue-blooded Parisian style. This, the last catwalk show of the week, was haute couture as it was meant to be seen. The salon was laden with chandeliers and lined with delicate gilt chairs, the scent of lilies hung heavy in the air, the vulgar trill of mobile phones was muted by strict decree. First came a series of suits, in every shade of grey from mother of pearl to charcoal. The parallel lines of the sharp-shouldered jackets and wide-brimmed hats, and the seemingly endless legs of high-waisted trousers, were as impossibly elegant as fashion illustrations brought to life. Pale leather gloves and shiny belts gave an old-fashioned polish to the collection - the Yves Saint Laurent couture client would not dream of leaving the house without earrings, let alone consider customising her handbag or wearing pink fishnet tights. For a designer renowned for bringing the influence of menswear into women's wardrobes, this was a very curvy collection. Fitted jackets were belted and worn with wiggle-inducing pencil skirts. Puff sleeves, and a millefeuille of organza at the hem of evening dresses both served to emphasise the female form. As the designs became more elaborate, colour and decoration erupted on to the catwalk. The front row madames were in raptures over classic Saint Laurent colour combinations such as cyclamen pink or jade green silk dresses cinched with black belts, and black suits with white buttons. A column dress in layers of chestnut tulle came with a gold belt, cappuccino-coloured hem frills and a mauve silk rose at one knee. For the most adventurous there was a straw hat covered in cherries, and a white organdie strapless dress with scalloped edging, embroidered with pineapples. The designer has the talent to make these flights of fancy work, but Saint Laurent is nonetheless well aware that even on the catwalk, less is often more. The bride who closed the show - Marianne Laetitia Casta - eschewed veils, trains and posies and strolled the catwalk in a cream going away skirt suit, nonchalantly smoking a cigarette. The designer himself clutched a bouquet of lily of the valley as he took his bow to a standing ovation.",

A big jotter in front of the 84-year-old writer is veined with black-ink lines about his current projects; on the other side of his worktop is a weaver's shuttle to remind him of the Blackburn he came from, if ever that were necessary. </p> <p>He darts around, snatching up and discarding pieces of evidence to flesh out a point, dropping aitches in his haste so that his 65-year-old wife is 'elga and life has become rather 'ectic. </p> <p>It is five years since Woodruff was in England and he wouldn't mind making a visit, doesn't think the trip, perhaps with a bit of book-signing, would do him any harm. Then he would be able to tell more people that The Road to Nab End was first published as Billy Boy three years before Angela's Ashes, by a small, now defunct publishing house. The Billy Boy title was rejected by Eland, the publishers which reissued the book last year, because of the German condoms that go by the same name. It has sold more than 20,000 copies. </p> <p>It is the story of Woodruff's life up to 1933 when he fled a Blackburn where people still died from hunger, for London, where they did not. He has all the ebullience and sense of mission of a new writer, but nothing could be further from the truth. \"Look,\" he says, \" that's Woodruff's best work. This one will last.\" He is talking about Vessel of Sadness, his 1969 book about the Battle of Anzio, the first chapter of which is to be reprinted in April in an anthology of war writing. \"It was compared to All Quiet on the Western Front,\" he adds. </p> <p>Woodruff believes that life, and naturally history, is random, driven by chance rather than proceeding in a linear fashion. This he illustrates with regular recourse to the nursery rhyme Hey Diddle Diddle. \"The dish ran away with the spoon, you see? You understand me?\" </p> <p>Vessel of Sadness was not understood by everyone, due to its unorthodox nature. John Wayne would not have been able to find a role in it. \"Where's the sex, they used to say when I sent it to New York. And where are the heroes? There are none - that's war, it's fragmented. There's no sex unless you go to Naples on leave and get the clap. That's the only sex.\" </p> <p>On the face of it, Woodruff wants for nothing, writing away, snug in his blue slippers and cardigan. By turns excited about the belated mainstream attention, self-effacing yet sure of his own value, he refers to himself often in the third person. \"There must be a buoyancy factor about him. You can't stifle him. You can't kill him. You can't knock him down. Great illnesses. In Africa I had everything. Too long a story, not worth telling.\" </p> <p>Woodruff does not need the money: the seven children are long since gone; he and 'elga have their home of 30 years, the pension, the social security and Brendan the black labrador. But 55 years ago, an acting colonel coming home from war, he chose a private life when he could have gone public, spurning the course that might have brought the wider recognition he wants now. </p> <p>After all, the Japanese produce beautiful editions of his books and have made a documentary about him. He has lectured there too. What is wrong with the UK? </p> <p>\"I suppose if I've done anything, if I'm worth anything, what's the big thing Nab End can do for me? ... if Preston was to give me an honorary degree. But no, Preston's too small.\" The University of Central Lancashire at Preston is where Woodruff deposits his papers (\"Handing in my cloth to God. You understand me?\"). </p> <p>\"Another university in the north of England, then. Let him boast: I think Nab End is a book that will last because it's a document of a time that would be impossible to write about these days without referring to it. </p> <p>\"The least I've heard from was Lancashire. Blackburn, you'd think the librarian would get in touch. Well, he did: don't send too many, we haven't got the shelf space. Especially Jack Straw, he represents Blackburn, doesn't he? Why doesn't he drop me a note? I've heard he likes the book.\" </p> <p>More, one supposes anyway, than Woodruff cares for Frank McCourt's Angela's Ashes. \"I started it and gave up. It was too much. Grim. I didn't want to say that. Nab End? Oh grim, yes, but joyful. There's a lot of humour in it. Oh, it was a miserable life, there's no denying it: 'ead in the oven was the normal.\" </p> <p>The young Woodruff's predilection for the abnormal took him to London and within a few years the boy who had spent most of his brief years at school sleeping - \"they were very kind to me in that way\" - was at Oxford on a scholarship. In 1952 another scholarship took him to the US. </p> <p>But before Harvard there was the second world war, in North Africa and Italy. \"I won't pretend he was a close friend at Oxford, but when I told Harold Wilson [the future prime minister] that I was going off to war he put his hand on his heart and said 'Woody, I've been called to higher things. I'm going to work with Beveridge.' </p> <p>\"Harold was a good speaker, but I was a better speaker than Harold Wilson. Gift of the gab. Oh, yes. I wanted to be an MP; I could easily have been given a district. I had a first-class war record; I had a first-class record at Oxford. I turned it down. I'd have made a damn good minister in a Labour cabinet. It's interesting that this guy didn't do it, don't you think? A mistake? Who knows? It doesn't matter. Hey diddle diddle.\" </p> <p>Woodruff turned it down because of what he calls the years the locusts ate: in five years of war he had seen his then wife for as many weeks. In the end she died of cancer after they had been together for 19 years. </p> <p>He produces a list of 61 titles - hardbacks, softbacks and translations - with his name on them and written since he left the UK, among them Impact of Western Man, A Study of Europe's Role in the World Economy 1750-1960; America's Impact on the World: A Study of the Role of the United States in the World Economy, 1750-1970; and his Concise History of the Modern World. </p> <p>\"Nothing compared to some, but not bad for a weaver's son.\" And that's without mentioning lectures on four continents and the academic positions he has held at the universities of Illinois, Melbourne, Princeton and Florida. </p> <p>The sequel to The Road to Nab End, Down the Road, which covers the years from 1933 to 1945, is finished and ready for publication, as is a novel that will come after that. \"It'll play out, it'll play out.

      "bodyText": "A British ad for a little-known canned fish brand has become an international cult phenomenon after making its way around the world via email. For a mere \u00a31m the commercial, for John West salmon, has drawn an audience that many better-known brands can only dream of after it was posted on the influential US website adcritic.com. The quirky humour of the ad, which shows a giant grizzly bear fighting a fisherman over one of his freshly-caught salmon, appealed to web watchers, who forwarded it to friends via email. Leo Burnett London, which made the ad, hired the Jim Henson company to make the convincing bear suit, which was designed to enable the stuntman playing the bear to perform a series of kung-fu kicks. The ad ends with the fisherman escaping with his booty with the help of a well-placed friend on a moped and the line, \"We endure the worst to bring you the best\". \"I think it's fair to say I was completely astonished by the reaction,\" said Paul Silburn, who wrote the ad. \"Tinned salmon is not the most inspiring of products to advertise but pretty much as soon as it launched we had retailers calling up to say how much they liked it and when it hit the adcritic site it really went mad.\" The ad was the first British commercial to appear on the site and has been its most popular since it was posted in December. The phenomenon has attracted media coverage as far afield as Australia and the US, although this is not necessarily good news for its UK owners, Heinz, because the brand is owned by rival food company Unilever outside Europe. John West follows in the famous footsteps of Mahir Cagri, the Turkish teacher who shot to stardom after his personal website was \"discovered\" by web watchers and forwarded around the world by email. More recently, Britain's Claire Squires became an overnight celebrity when a risque email she sent to her boyfriend found its way to his friends - and then around the world.

No group of children suffers worse handicaps in our schools than non-academic pupils. The cost - to individuals as well as to the country - of this deep divide between academic and vocational education was laid bare earlier this week in a grim report from the basic skills agency. The numbers are almost unbelievable: 7m adults unable to read and write as well as the average 11-year-old; one in five adults of working age unable to look up a plumber in the yellow pages, or read the instructions on a medicine bottle. Even more have trouble with numbers.</p> <p>These are not new statistics. They have been set out in report after report. One cause is the historic divide between academic and vocational education. Compared with what happens in continental Europe, vocational education has always had low esteem in Britain. One result has been a critical shortage of skilled workers. Another has been much lower productivity here than in France, Germany and the Netherlands. The problem begins at 14. There is little on offer for non-academic children. They are able to take a general national vocational qualification (GNVQ), but there is no evidence that employers value them, and masses of evidence that pupils dislike them. And for good reason: they do not lead anywhere. Hence their dismal completion rate: a mere 40%. Disaffection is rife with a system that is still geared to encouraging everyone to pursue the academic - including a ludicrous target of 95% achieving at least one GCSE, as though an F in one subject will get anyone anywhere. No wonder there is such a steep rise in truancy by non-academic children in older age groups.</p> <p>Belatedly all this is to change. David Blunkett's vocational plan will offer 14-year-olds a positive choice, rather than a second class fall back position. New links are to be made between schools, further education colleges, and work places. GNVQs were meant to be work-related, but had few work-related elements. They will be replaced by vocational GCSEs. Standards will be monitored to raise their esteem. There will be no GCSE in plumbing, but there will be a GCSE in applied technology that will gain access to apprenticeships. Construction industry estimates suggest we need an extra 30,000 plumbers and 35,000 new electricians in the next five years. Both trades pay more than does teaching.</p> <p>The programme will begin in a modest way - 40,000 part time placements in 2002/3 - but this is probably wise. To succeed, it has to win the support of employers. Better to begin modestly, and demonstrate success. The second key test of the reform is ensuring that the courses provide a genuine career ladder for the non-academic. Their needs have been overlooked for too long.</p>",

There will be no GCSE in plumbing, but there will be a GCSE in applied technology that will gain access to apprenticeships. Construction industry estimates suggest we need an extra 30,000 plumbers and 35,000 new electricians in the next five years. Both trades pay more than does teaching. The programme will begin in a modest way - 40,000 part time placements in 2002/3 - but this is probably wise. To succeed, it has to win the support of employers. Better to begin modestly, and demonstrate success. The second key test of the reform is ensuring that the courses provide a genuine career ladder for the non-academic. Their needs have been overlooked for too long.",

      "bodyText": "The Israeli cabinet decided last night to resume peace talks with the Palestinians, a day after suspending the negotiations because of the killing of two Israelis visiting the West Bank. A government statement said the talks would resume this afternoon in the Egyptian resort of Taba, after the funeral of the two in Haifa. The prime minister, Ehud Barak, recalled the leaders of his negotiating team for consultations after the joint owners of a Tel Aviv sushi bar were killed by masked gunmen. Motti Dayan, 27, and Etgar Zeituni, 36, were abducted and shot dead after entering the city of Tulkarem, looking for supplies for their restaurant. \"They went to eat houmus and were murdered,\" Yediot Ahronoth, Israel's biggest selling Hebrew language daily, said yesterday. Radio chat shows spent hours discussing the final moments of the men, who were cousins. The Palestinian negotiators spent yesterday alone in Taba, waiting to hear whether Mr Barak would send his team back. Although he has decided to do so, his advisers admit that he is going through the motions of talks to polish his image as a peacemaker before Israel's prime ministerial election on February 6. On chat shows and in parliament, Israelis strove to understand how the two Tel Aviv restaurateurs could have been so oblivious to the explosive situation in the West Bank. Although the Palestinian uprising seeped into Israel's coastal area weeks ago, with the bus bombings in Tel Aviv and Netanya, the toll of more than 370 deaths had little impact on Sheinkin Street, a strip of cafes and boutiques which is the preserve of bohemians who would rather talk about the beach than politics. Yesterday, as death notices were pasted in the windows of Yuppies, the cafe the men jointly owned, a handful of rightwing protesters arrived to jeer at the quarter's habitues for ever believing there could be peace with the Palestinians. Friends of the two also had doubts. \"Etgar had a lot of Arab Israeli friends. He be lieved in peace and coexistence but he seems to have been wrong,\" a woman called Irit told Yediot. The two visited Tulkarem with an Israeli Arab business colleague to stock up on pots and plants for their cafe, taking advantage of the lower prices in the West Bank. They were marched from a restaurant at gunpoint by four masked men and shot dead. The military wing of Hamas, the Islamist group, said it killed them. Since the uprising began in September, Israelis have been forbidden to visit the West Bank. It is easy to get around the ban and the army roadblocks, but very few Israeli reporters have bothered.

Aisha Abdel-Karim Nassar, 28, was detained for 45 minutes near Ramallah and died there, said Moussa Abu Hmeid, the director of West Bank hospitals. Despite such media self-censorship, the army said there was no excuse for casual outings to the West Bank. \"Whoever does not understand the reality here of the last four months has been out of the country or has not left the house,\" Brigadier Ron Kitrey said.

      "body": "<p>The chief statistician yesterday identified a rise in immigration as the most significant social change in Britain of recent years. </p> <p>Len Cook, the former head of New Zealand's statistical service who took over as the UK national statistician in July, said population patterns through most of the 20th century had changed dramatically during the 1990s as migration became the main engine of population growth. </p> <p>The figures came in Social Trends, the official annual digest of facts and figures about life in Britain. It also showed growing inequalities between rich and poor, mounting consumer debt and increasing use of credit cards instead of cash or cheques. </p> <p>Mr Cook said \"homegrown\" population increases - the surplus of births over deaths - hugely exceeded net migration into the UK from 1900 to 1990. Indeed for much of the century there was a net outflow of people. But between 1991 and 1999 net immigration averaged 104,000 a year, compared with a homegrown population rise averaging 107,000. </p> <p>Mr Cook said the change was particularly stark in the closing years of the century, when migration became the predominant demographic influence. Immigration overtook natural population growth in England and Wales in 1994-95. By 1998-99 net inward migration increased to 194,000, while natural population growth fell to 72,000. \"This amounts to a huge shift in the importance of immigration to changes in the British population, with consequences for ethnic mix and age structure,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Since immigrants go disproportionately to London, it will also affect where people live.\" </p> <p>The immigrants came mainly from outside the European Union. Refugees who were granted asylum or given leave to stay made up a small proportion - just over 10,000 in 1999. On Monday the Home Office forecast between 150,000 and 175,000 immigrants from outside the EU each year until 2005. </p> <p>Barbara Roche, the immigration minister, said: \"The UK is a nation of immigrants. Immigration is a very good thing and has benefited the country.\" Advantages included skills brought by workers needed by the expanding information technology industry, and the younger age profile of immigrants that would help to balance the pressures of an ageing population. </p> <p>Social Trends estimated that the UK population would rise from 59.5m in 1999 to peak at nearly 65m in 2036. Population growth in England, Wales and Northern Ireland would be partly offset by a slight fall in Scotland. </p> <p>The survey said the British population had increased by more than half during the 20th century, but the number of households tripled in the same period to almost 24m in spring 2000. </p> <p>Almost three in 10 households comprised one person in spring 2000 - more than two and a half times the proportion in 1961. </p> <p>There were 179,000 first marriages in the UK in 1999 - less than half the number in 1970. The average age of women at childbirth in England and Wales rose over the same period from 26.2 years to 29. </p> <p>The survey found that the distribution of income became more unequal in the 80s, stabilised in the early 90s and began to widen again in 1997. In 1997-98 the income of the richest 10% rose 4% to \u00a3559.70 a week, while for the poorest it rose only 1.8% to \u00a3136.10. </p> <p>Latest official figures for 1998 showed that Britain was the most expensive European country outside Scandinavia. A British resident would find goods and services at least 10% cheaper in Italy and the Netherlands, and more than 20% cheaper in Spain, Greece and Portugal. </p> <p>The amount of consumer credit outstanding in the UK increased to \u00a3115bn in 1999, almost double the 1987 level in real terms. The volume of cash payments fell during the 1990s but still accounted for two-thirds of all transactions. </p> <p>Plastic card payments tripled, cash withdrawals doubled and there was a 75% increase in direct debits, standing orders and other automated payments. Payments by cheque declined by a quarter. About one in five debit card purchases in supermarkets involved cashback, with an average value of \u00a324. </p> <p>The survey came on the bicentenary of the first British census. In 1801 there were about 10m people in Britain and about 2m households. Since then population has increased by nearly six times and the number of households by 12 times. In 1821 half the population was aged under 20, compared with a quarter in 1999. </p> <p><strong>The nation by numbers</strong></p> <p>Social Trends, a 268-page snapshot of UK life published by the office of national statistics, contains 321 tables and charts. Here are some of the facts they contain: </p> <p>\u0095 Between 1981 and 1999 the number of GPs in Britain rose by a third to 36,000. But the number of nurses and other direct care staff in NHS hospitals and community health services fell by 4% </p> <p>\u0095 The proportion of three- and four-year-olds enrolled in UK schools tripled from 21% in 1970-71 to 64% in 1999-00. In spring 2000, 5.7m people of working age were studying towards a qualification in the UK, just over half of whom were aged 16-24 </p> <p>\u0095 The consumption of fresh potatoes has fallen steadily from 1,300 grams a person a week in 1974 to less than 700 grams in 1999. But fresh fruit consumption rose over the same period from 500 grams to nearly 750 grams </p> <p>\u0095 In 1999 about 276,000 hectares of land had been converted, or were in the process of being converted, to organic farming. This was six times more than in 1995 </p> <p>\u0095 In spring 2000 there were 27m people of working age in employment in the UK - the most since 1959 when records began. Over that period the proportion of men in work fell to 79% while the proportion of women rose from 47% to 69% </p> <p>\u0095 Among non-married women under 60, the proportion cohabiting almost doubled between 1986 and 1998-99 - from 13% to 25%. For men it more than doubled from 11% to 26% </p> <p>\u0095 Three-quarters of adults agree that \"families with working mothers need grandparents' help more and more\". One in 10 said grandparents have \"little to teach the grandchildren of today\" </p> <p>\u0095 A third of domestic water in England and Wales was used for personal washing, including baths, showers and hand basins. A quarter - between 35 and 45 litres a head a day - was used for flushing the toilet, according to environment agency statistics for 1997-98. </p> <p>\u0095 The proportion of houses fitted with a burglar alarm doubled between 1992 and 2000, from 13% to 26% </p> <p>\u0095 The breeding population of woodpigeons doubled between 1971 and 1999, while great tits, chaffinches and robins were up by at least a quarter. But the population of skylarks, yellowhammers and song thrushes fell by more than half and starlings declined by 65% </p> <p>\u0095 In spring 2000, there were 855,000 people working in IT-related occupations, an increase of 45% in five years.

He also accused her of \"failing to report to me on the whereabouts of the children for weeks at a time, subjecting the twins to illegal activities and underhanded doings.\" The pair divorced before the twins were born last June. </p> <p>The order in favour of Mr Wecker has no immediate effect because the twins remain in foster care after being taken from the Kilshaws by Flintshire social services.

      "bodyText": "The battle over the fate of the internet twins became a four-way fight yesterday after the babies' real father was granted custody by a judge in their home town, St Louis, Missouri. Circuit judge Jack Garvey granted the custody order, effective until the court's next hearing on February 14, to Aaron Wecker, father of the girls and former husband of Tranda Wecker, who \"sold\" them twice over the internet. Mr Wecker, who has custody of the couple's three-year-old child, joins the battle against his ex-wife, who says she wants them back, and with the two couples who paid a California-based agency to adopt them. Kimberley and Belinda, were first given to a California couple, Richard and Vickie Allen of San Bernardino, then handed over to Alan and Judith Kilshaw, by Ms Wecker after they agreed to pay more. Court papers filed by Mr Wecker last Monday allege that Ms Wecker neglected the twins by trying to sell them twice, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch. He also accused her of \"failing to report to me on the whereabouts of the children for weeks at a time, subjecting the twins to illegal activities and underhanded doings.\" The pair divorced before the twins were born last June. The order in favour of Mr Wecker has no immediate effect because the twins remain in foster care after being taken from the Kilshaws by Flintshire social services. The Kilshaws adopted the twins in Arkansas, although the adoption may be invalid because Ms Wecker has admitting lying to get around the state's residence requirements. The twist is another complication for Mr Justice Kirkwood, the high court judge who took over the case last Tuesday. He has promised a decision soon on the twins' future. Allan Levy QC, a child law expert, said the real father might emerge as the right person to give them a home. \"If he's the natural father and he's OK, the sooner they go there the better.\" Ms Wecker said on Tuesday that she wanted the babies back. \"I have a job.

      "bodyText": "Proposals for the most radical shake up of mental health law in Scotland for more than 15 years were published today, including new arrangements for the compulsory care and treatment of people with mental health problems. A report by the government-sponsored Millan committee calls for a new Mental Health Act to be introduced north of the border, together with reforms that will enable new community orders to allow patients to be compulsorily treated in the community. The Scottish executive welcomed the review and announced that a major policy statement would be published this summer setting out proposals for legislative change. But its recommendations on compulsory treatment in the community - similar to those proposed in mental health reforms for England last month - were criticised by mental health charity Mental Health Foundation as \"unworkable and impracticable\". The Millan committee, chaired by former Scottish secretary Bruce Millan, was set up by the then Scottish health minister Sam Galbraith two years ago to review the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984. Mr Millan said: \"We believe that a new act is required, reflecting the huge changes in mental health care in recent years, and the greater recognition of the rights of mental health service users and their families. \"Compulsion should be justified by clear and specific criteria. Linking compulsory treatment to a specific plan of care is a flexible approach which should help to ensure that patients receive the treatment that they need, without unnecessary use of legal measures. \"In particular, it should be possible for compulsory treatment to be delivered in the community rather than hospital, where this is the best option for the individual patient.\" The report also calls for a new independent tribunal to replace sheriff courts in considering compulsory measures, and for the system of dealing with mentally disordered offenders to be reformed, including new arrangements for discharging restricted patients. \"For the small number of people with mental disorders who commit serious offences, there needs to be a more systematic approach to risk assessment and management. The Risk Management Authority, proposed by the MacLean committee, would have a role in this,\" said Mr Millan. Scottish health minister Susan Deacon said the executive would deliver changes to both strengthen the rights of people with mental illness and secure a comprehensive framework of measures to protect the community from the small number of mentally disordered offenders who posed a risk to the public. National Schizophrenia Fellowship (Scotland) welcomed the principles of participation of service users in all aspects of their assessment, care, treatment and support, coupled with recognition and respect for those providing informal care. \"We particularly welcome the recommendation that a new act should be based on principles which should underpin any intervention, with benefit for the service user being the main criterion for compulsory measures, rather than 'treatability', as at present,\" said spokesman Ian Harper. The Association of Directors of Social Work welcomed the review's recommendation that adequate resources should be made available. \"In its submission, ADSW argued strongly for the retention of social work-qualified mental health officers being appointed by local authorities, and are pleased to see this in the report,\" said spokesman Duncan MacAulay. The British Association of Social Workers said the review took a more holistic approach than proposals in England, which were very much focused on risk assessment. \"Unlike south of the border, where the role of the approved social worker has been diminished, it is an endorsement of the social work contribution,\" said professional officer Ruth Stark.",

      "trailText": "<p>With News at Ten back in its rightful slot and winning the ratings war, Trevor McDonald is a happy man.  <strong>Stephen Moss</strong> finds him warmer and wittier than he is on TV.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Trevor McDonald is visibly pleased to be back in the old routine. News At Ten has returned to its time-honoured slot, and on the first night, with a bit of help from Chris Tarrant, had almost double the audience of its BBC rival. Sir Trevor - McDonald seems rather cold for this living-room presence - feels vindicated: the power of the News at Ten \"brand\" has been demonstrated and ITV, rapped on the knuckles by the regulator, won't be shifting it again in a hurry. </p> <p>\"In the last few days before it came back, I could hardly walk down the street without being accosted by at least a dozen people,\" he says. \"The programme has a strong hold on the public imagination and it's nice to be part of that. There was a big campaign to bring it back, but there hasn't been the same campaign to bring back the Nine O'Clock News, which is also a venerable institution.\" </p> <p>Sir Trevor's part in that campaign was a little ambiguous. He was clearly never happy with the decision to shift the late-evening broadcast to 11pm, but reluctantly went along with it. \"I never opposed the move,\" he says. \"If I'd opposed it as strongly as people said, I wouldn't still be working here. I did the 6:30 broadcast and I quite enjoyed working in the early evening despite what people think, but I'm glad News at Ten is back.\" </p> <p>And back with a bang, if not a bong. Yesterday came the first big test, with the resignation of Peter Mandelson, and ITV quickly OK-ed ITN's request for a longer bulletin. \"ITV gave me a commitment that when there were big stories it would be possible to extend the broadcast,\" McDonald told me as the Mandelson story unfolded. \"Whenever there is a big story, we will extend. ITV recognise the value of news. We did some programmes at nine o'clock during the floods and 11 million people watched them.\" </p> <p>On a run-of-the-mill day, 16 or 17 minutes will have to suffice, but Sir Trevor reckons that will suffice. \"You have to get more into less, but I think we can do that. The multi-media environment is changing people's habits, and people watch TV news programmes for shorter times now.\" </p> <p>The switch back to 10pm has been a major climbdown for ITV's executives, who had spent 10 years wheeler-dealing around government, regulators and viewers to shift News at Ten out to 11pm. An audience of six million had been deemed unsatisfactory; now, it seems, they would be reasonably happy with that. The programme is guaranteed to be on at 10pm three times a week; ITV has the option to move it to 10.30pm once a week; and it will be on at 11pm on Friday. In a nice post-modern touch, it will be called News at Ten regardless of what time it goes out. </p> <p>McDonald was a dignified part of the mourning process in 1998 when the News at When? debacle began. The Independent Television Commission (ITC) had the power to reverse the decision, though it seemed unlikely that it would do so, but eventually it told ITV that the decline in news audiences was too great and News at Ten must return. </p> <p>In the meantime, the BBC had announced it would move the Nine O'Clock News to 10pm, a change it made late last year. Its new-look schedule initially triumphed, with help from Men in Black and The Royle Family, and then began to lose out as soon as BBC1 ran out of its top programmes. Viewing figures for news broadcasts are not primarily about the news, or even who reads it, but what is on before the news. Save for the odd petrol crisis, when viewers will watch wall-to-wall news to find out how to fill up the Micra, our choice of which bulletin to watch is governed principally by what we are watching immediately beforehand. </p> <p>With head to head bulletins, the BBC knew there was no chance of beating ITV. Senior executives have been briefing journalists for weeks that the programmes in primetime were not really up to the job of beating ITV bankers such as Who wants to be a Millionaire? and Peak Practice. BBC1 still lacks the popular drama hits which sit in primetime and produce healthy lead-in audiences to news bulletins. </p> <p>On the first night of the new News at Ten, Sir Trevor achieved 8.1m, with a handy 12.8m leg-up from Chris Tarrant. On BBC1, Peter Sissons had less help from Second Sight - one of the worst-performing dramas the BBC has made in recent times - and managed just 4.4m viewers. On Tuesday, Peak Practice handed nearly 9m viewers over to Trevor, who kept 5.9m of them. Sissons, still struggling with Second Sight, which itself lost viewers from Monday to Tuesday, got 4.3m. </p> <p>Unless the BBC's performance improves, it is sure to come under pressure to move its broadcast back to nine, a move McDonald would support. \"I'm not sure how well the audience is served at the moment,\" he says tentatively. \"I prefer choice, personally.\" </p> <p>Sir Trevor is the soul of decorum, but can't help crowing a little at News at Ten's performance. \"It is slightly churlish of our opponents, to write off an audience of 8m. Never do that. Don't ever suggest that people are stupid enough to watch the opposition.\" </p> <p>He also mocks the complaints about letting Who Wants to be a Millionaire overrun to deter channel switching. \"ITV have done that before. That's nothing new. These guys are a commercial channel. They play for audiences. They do all sorts of things like that. People seem to think this was a ploy for the return of News at Ten, but they've been doing it for several months - missing the commercial break and so on. </p> <p>\"I don't have any deep inside knowledge of what ITV now calls 'junction management', but they've been doing this for some time. They want to get more people watching their programmes than the BBC's. This may be revolutionary news to the BBC, but I assure you it is ITV's intent.\" </p> <p>This rumbustious statement, and the laughter that accompanies it, is delivered with great animation. Much more animation, in fact, than he ever displays when presenting the news, which seems a great shame. He is far warmer and wittier in person than on the screen, where it's all gravitas; his voice also seems more lyrical than when he broadcasts. Why the difference? \"One is natural, the other one isn't,\" he says succinctly. \"Going into a studio and reading off an autocue is not terribly natural. It's a performance. It's not like slipping down to the pub.\" </p> <p>McDonald has been the public face of ITN for so long - almost 20 years - that he has perhaps forgotten how to show his private face. In his little glass-walled office at ITN's London headquarters, from where he is able to keep a beady eye on News at Ten editor Nigel Dacre, he is full of fun, happy to explain why he was so po-faced about Noel Edmonds' Gotcha (\"I was tired after presenting a three-hour awards show and didn't have a clue what was going on\") and easy to talk to, not a bit like the voice-of-the-nation image. He would like to do a chatshow at some point, and he would probably be pretty good at it. </p> <p>He is 61 now, enjoying this second coming, but aware that retirement from ITN and his beloved News at Ten isn't too far away. \"I have a contract until I'm 65, and that will probably be enough. They will probably have seen enough of me by then. It's a great art to know when to go. It would be awful to hang around, with people whispering about you in the corridors.

      "bodyText": "Trevor McDonald is visibly pleased to be back in the old routine. News At Ten has returned to its time-honoured slot, and on the first night, with a bit of help from Chris Tarrant, had almost double the audience of its BBC rival. Sir Trevor - McDonald seems rather cold for this living-room presence - feels vindicated: the power of the News at Ten \"brand\" has been demonstrated and ITV, rapped on the knuckles by the regulator, won't be shifting it again in a hurry. \"In the last few days before it came back, I could hardly walk down the street without being accosted by at least a dozen people,\" he says. \"The programme has a strong hold on the public imagination and it's nice to be part of that. There was a big campaign to bring it back, but there hasn't been the same campaign to bring back the Nine O'Clock News, which is also a venerable institution.\" Sir Trevor's part in that campaign was a little ambiguous. He was clearly never happy with the decision to shift the late-evening broadcast to 11pm, but reluctantly went along with it. \"I never opposed the move,\" he says. \"If I'd opposed it as strongly as people said, I wouldn't still be working here. I did the 6:30 broadcast and I quite enjoyed working in the early evening despite what people think, but I'm glad News at Ten is back.\" And back with a bang, if not a bong. Yesterday came the first big test, with the resignation of Peter Mandelson, and ITV quickly OK-ed ITN's request for a longer bulletin. \"ITV gave me a commitment that when there were big stories it would be possible to extend the broadcast,\" McDonald told me as the Mandelson story unfolded. \"Whenever there is a big story, we will extend. ITV recognise the value of news. We did some programmes at nine o'clock during the floods and 11 million people watched them.\" On a run-of-the-mill day, 16 or 17 minutes will have to suffice, but Sir Trevor reckons that will suffice. \"You have to get more into less, but I think we can do that. The multi-media environment is changing people's habits, and people watch TV news programmes for shorter times now.\" The switch back to 10pm has been a major climbdown for ITV's executives, who had spent 10 years wheeler-dealing around government, regulators and viewers to shift News at Ten out to 11pm. An audience of six million had been deemed unsatisfactory; now, it seems, they would be reasonably happy with that. The programme is guaranteed to be on at 10pm three times a week; ITV has the option to move it to 10.30pm once a week; and it will be on at 11pm on Friday. In a nice post-modern touch, it will be called News at Ten regardless of what time it goes out. McDonald was a dignified part of the mourning process in 1998 when the News at When? debacle began. The Independent Television Commission (ITC) had the power to reverse the decision, though it seemed unlikely that it would do so, but eventually it told ITV that the decline in news audiences was too great and News at Ten must return. In the meantime, the BBC had announced it would move the Nine O'Clock News to 10pm, a change it made late last year. Its new-look schedule initially triumphed, with help from Men in Black and The Royle Family, and then began to lose out as soon as BBC1 ran out of its top programmes. Viewing figures for news broadcasts are not primarily about the news, or even who reads it, but what is on before the news. Save for the odd petrol crisis, when viewers will watch wall-to-wall news to find out how to fill up the Micra, our choice of which bulletin to watch is governed principally by what we are watching immediately beforehand. With head to head bulletins, the BBC knew there was no chance of beating ITV. Senior executives have been briefing journalists for weeks that the programmes in primetime were not really up to the job of beating ITV bankers such as Who wants to be a Millionaire? and Peak Practice. BBC1 still lacks the popular drama hits which sit in primetime and produce healthy lead-in audiences to news bulletins. On the first night of the new News at Ten, Sir Trevor achieved 8.1m, with a handy 12.8m leg-up from Chris Tarrant. On BBC1, Peter Sissons had less help from Second Sight - one of the worst-performing dramas the BBC has made in recent times - and managed just 4.4m viewers. On Tuesday, Peak Practice handed nearly 9m viewers over to Trevor, who kept 5.9m of them. Sissons, still struggling with Second Sight, which itself lost viewers from Monday to Tuesday, got 4.3m. Unless the BBC's performance improves, it is sure to come under pressure to move its broadcast back to nine, a move McDonald would support. \"I'm not sure how well the audience is served at the moment,\" he says tentatively. \"I prefer choice, personally.\" Sir Trevor is the soul of decorum, but can't help crowing a little at News at Ten's performance. \"It is slightly churlish of our opponents, to write off an audience of 8m. Never do that. Don't ever suggest that people are stupid enough to watch the opposition.\" He also mocks the complaints about letting Who Wants to be a Millionaire overrun to deter channel switching. \"ITV have done that before. That's nothing new. These guys are a commercial channel. They play for audiences. They do all sorts of things like that. People seem to think this was a ploy for the return of News at Ten, but they've been doing it for several months - missing the commercial break and so on. \"I don't have any deep inside knowledge of what ITV now calls 'junction management', but they've been doing this for some time. They want to get more people watching their programmes than the BBC's. This may be revolutionary news to the BBC, but I assure you it is ITV's intent.\" This rumbustious statement, and the laughter that accompanies it, is delivered with great animation. Much more animation, in fact, than he ever displays when presenting the news, which seems a great shame. He is far warmer and wittier in person than on the screen, where it's all gravitas; his voice also seems more lyrical than when he broadcasts. Why the difference? \"One is natural, the other one isn't,\" he says succinctly. \"Going into a studio and reading off an autocue is not terribly natural. It's a performance. It's not like slipping down to the pub.\" McDonald has been the public face of ITN for so long - almost 20 years - that he has perhaps forgotten how to show his private face. In his little glass-walled office at ITN's London headquarters, from where he is able to keep a beady eye on News at Ten editor Nigel Dacre, he is full of fun, happy to explain why he was so po-faced about Noel Edmonds' Gotcha (\"I was tired after presenting a three-hour awards show and didn't have a clue what was going on\") and easy to talk to, not a bit like the voice-of-the-nation image. He would like to do a chatshow at some point, and he would probably be pretty good at it. He is 61 now, enjoying this second coming, but aware that retirement from ITN and his beloved News at Ten isn't too far away. \"I have a contract until I'm 65, and that will probably be enough. They will probably have seen enough of me by then. It's a great art to know when to go. It would be awful to hang around, with people whispering about you in the corridors. It would be really sad after you've had such a great time. Go quickly when the time comes - that's the best advice. But I won't retire completely. The concept of retire ment as stasis, when you do absolutely nothing is not one I understand.\" Which is where he hopes the chat shows and one-off interviews come in. He is healthy, plays tennis, and doesn't spend quite as long in the ITN building as he used to. He arrives at lunchtime, attends all the meetings and starts tinkering with his script around seven. \"If you are going to make this thing your own, if you are going to stamp your personality on it, you have to be comfortable with what you are saying,\" he explains.

      "body": "<p>There was a rueful irony in two downpage reports in this newspaper yesterday. A news page told of celebrations in Cornwall to mark the precise centenary the day before of the first long-distance wireless \"broadcast\" - the 200-mile message delivered to the Lizard from the Isle of Wight by the Italian Guglielmo Marconi - and these sports pages told of a commercial row which may threaten television coverage of England's upcoming tour of Sri Lanka.</p> <p>That is a hundred years to show how money, not enlightenment, really keeps the score in sport - although I daresay Marconi might have approved. He was as much fat-cat businessman as far-seeing inventor.</p> <p>Unquestionably the excitement at the Lizard 100 Januaries ago was to trigger a fundamental revolution for sport and games. Mind you, after that wintry Cornish breakthrough in 1901 it took an awful long time for sport and broadcasting even to make eyes at each other. And, when they did, the relationship seldom made for cosy cohabitation.</p> <p>Nor has it always been money that has come between them. For instance, three-score years after Marconi's 200-mile Eureka the Football League still maintained a total ban on any live radio broadcasting of its matches, however much it was offered; and, when it did allow one experimental televised match to be covered - Bolton v Blackpool in 1960 - the 0-0 draw had the League at once reimposing its prohibition, \"intensely worried,\" as it put it, \"that broadcasting such boring matches could seriously damage the game's image\". (Oh, for such philosophic generosity now).</p> <p>Marconi's historic broadcast on January 23 1901 transmitted only Morse code dots and dashes, as did his first transatlantic signal from Cornwall to Newfoundland in December that same year. The first long-range voice-speaking \"entertainment\" radio broadcast was on Christmas Eve five years later when the Canadian inventor Reginald Fessenden accompanied on his violin an un-named female voice singing Silent Night and from transmission at Brant Rock, Massachusetts, it was heard by a wireless operator on board a United Fruit company's banana boat in mid-Atlantic.</p> <p>Sport did not catch on till 1916 - and then only by the by when sponsors on the first experimental \"wireless station\", New York's thrice-a-week 2XG, began randomly mentioning that night's baseball scores between playing scratchy phonograph recordings.</p> <p>In 1919 two New York reporters transmitted by wireless the result to their papers from Toledo of Jack Dempsey's third-round slam-dunk of Jess Willard. Two years later, on July 2 1921, Dempsey's successful title defence against Georges Carpentier in New Jersey is generally accepted as the first live wireless commentary of a sports event - at the microphone was a Major Andrew White - although the fact is that, for practice and by way of a technical run-through, he had begun commentating towards the end of the previous, preliminary, bout, so in fact it is two unknown pugs, Packie O'Gatty and Frankie Burns, who should be indelible in history.</p> <p>In Australia the following winter a reporter named Len Watt was dispatched with a microphone from Sydney's pioneering 2BL wireless station and told to \"stand on the boundary and keep talking\" about Charles Bannerman's testimonial match at the SCG.</p> <p>Britain caught on five years later, when the BBC covered, live, the England v Wales rugby international in January 1927, followed at once that spring with the Boat Race and Cup final and, in October, its first ringside boxing commentary - Teddy Baldock v Willie Smith at the Royal Albert Hall - a fortnight after which a letter in the Radio Times summed up, for sport anyway, this Tuesday's Marconi centenary: \"... cosmic, a wonder, a miracle, as I followed each three minutes seated in an armchair with a cigarette\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "There was a rueful irony in two downpage reports in this newspaper yesterday. A news page told of celebrations in Cornwall to mark the precise centenary the day before of the first long-distance wireless \"broadcast\" - the 200-mile message delivered to the Lizard from the Isle of Wight by the Italian Guglielmo Marconi - and these sports pages told of a commercial row which may threaten television coverage of England's upcoming tour of Sri Lanka. That is a hundred years to show how money, not enlightenment, really keeps the score in sport - although I daresay Marconi might have approved. He was as much fat-cat businessman as far-seeing inventor. Unquestionably the excitement at the Lizard 100 Januaries ago was to trigger a fundamental revolution for sport and games. Mind you, after that wintry Cornish breakthrough in 1901 it took an awful long time for sport and broadcasting even to make eyes at each other. And, when they did, the relationship seldom made for cosy cohabitation. Nor has it always been money that has come between them. For instance, three-score years after Marconi's 200-mile Eureka the Football League still maintained a total ban on any live radio broadcasting of its matches, however much it was offered; and, when it did allow one experimental televised match to be covered - Bolton v Blackpool in 1960 - the 0-0 draw had the League at once reimposing its prohibition, \"intensely worried,\" as it put it, \"that broadcasting such boring matches could seriously damage the game's image\". (Oh, for such philosophic generosity now). Marconi's historic broadcast on January 23 1901 transmitted only Morse code dots and dashes, as did his first transatlantic signal from Cornwall to Newfoundland in December that same year. The first long-range voice-speaking \"entertainment\" radio broadcast was on Christmas Eve five years later when the Canadian inventor Reginald Fessenden accompanied on his violin an un-named female voice singing Silent Night and from transmission at Brant Rock, Massachusetts, it was heard by a wireless operator on board a United Fruit company's banana boat in mid-Atlantic. Sport did not catch on till 1916 - and then only by the by when sponsors on the first experimental \"wireless station\", New York's thrice-a-week 2XG, began randomly mentioning that night's baseball scores between playing scratchy phonograph recordings. In 1919 two New York reporters transmitted by wireless the result to their papers from Toledo of Jack Dempsey's third-round slam-dunk of Jess Willard. Two years later, on July 2 1921, Dempsey's successful title defence against Georges Carpentier in New Jersey is generally accepted as the first live wireless commentary of a sports event - at the microphone was a Major Andrew White - although the fact is that, for practice and by way of a technical run-through, he had begun commentating towards the end of the previous, preliminary, bout, so in fact it is two unknown pugs, Packie O'Gatty and Frankie Burns, who should be indelible in history. In Australia the following winter a reporter named Len Watt was dispatched with a microphone from Sydney's pioneering 2BL wireless station and told to \"stand on the boundary and keep talking\" about Charles Bannerman's testimonial match at the SCG. Britain caught on five years later, when the BBC covered, live, the England v Wales rugby international in January 1927, followed at once that spring with the Boat Race and Cup final and, in October, its first ringside boxing commentary - Teddy Baldock v Willie Smith at the Royal Albert Hall - a fortnight after which a letter in the Radio Times summed up, for sport anyway, this Tuesday's Marconi centenary: \"... cosmic, a wonder, a miracle, as I followed each three minutes seated in an armchair with a cigarette\".",

They are calling on the UK's employers to start treating staff more fairly, by cutting back on long hours and stop bosses bullying workers. One of the UK's largest income protection insurers, Unum, says its claims for stress have risen by 88% over the last seven years, while those for chronic fatigue syndrome are up by 40%. Unum was responding to a recent survey from BMRB International among 1,200 full and part time workers which found two thirds of them were stressed, with some 73% admitting it was affecting their performance. Eugene McCormack, Unum's marketing director said: \"This survey should be seen as a wake up call for the UK's business community. They appear to be allowing the working environment to become increasingly stressful and it cost could them.\" Unum is campaigning for employers to move away from long working days, which it says do not result in increased efficiency, only increased levels of illness. Other income protection insurers such as Royal &amp; SunAlliance and Norwich Union also say they have been hit by increased levels of claims for stress. The annual cost of stress-related sickness to British business is now more than \u00a34billion, according to Professor Cary Cooper, Bupa professor of organisational psychology and health at University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist). Professor Cooper warns that stress levels in Britain are higher than in any other country in Europe and that they will increase rapidly in the next decade. Although some private medical insurance policies will pay for psychiatric treatment for stress problems, those off work for long periods need to have been covered by income protection. This type of insurance pays for the amount of time someone is off work and typically offers a tax-free monthly benefit of around 60% of salary. But, only around 11% of the UK population is covered by income protection. It is expensive if bought on an individual basis and while some companies provide it, many people in high pressure jobs have no insurance at all. Critical illness insurance, which is more popular than income protection, does not cover stress. Instead this pays out on diagnosis of a number of severe conditions such as heart attack, stroke or cancer. Yet the most likely reasons for long term absence from work are stress and back problems. Many people though are just not able to afford both income protection and critical illness cover - someone in their 30s, for example, could be paying over \u00a380 a month in premiums.

      "body": "<p>Telephone calls before 7am are usually bad news. I received one from Peter Mandelson at 6:30am on the day of his home loan resignation. He was more downcast then than he was yesterday morning when he called again, this time at 6:45am and remarkably upbeat.</p> <p>I was asleep when the phone rang. What's going on, I asked. \"I'll tell you exactly what's going on: I'm being attacked by the right and the left.\" He then gave an encyclopaedic breakdown of what had happened since the weekend. Despite the obvious pressure he seemed calm. Unlike our similar conversation two years ago, the idea of resignation never arose.</p> <p>On the face of it the passport story was not that serious. Peter acknowledged that the answer his office had given the Observer on Saturday afternoon had been unclear, though perhaps no more so than similar responses given by him or many of his colleagues to journalists over the years. The conversation ended with Peter's typical sign-off: \"Speak to you later.\"</p> <p>Yet in little more than five hours he had thrown in the towel and ended his career as a frontline politician. This was so different to my time with him in December 1998 when he clung on to ministerial office for as long as possible until the prime minister effectively asked him to resign. That time I had the surreal responsibility of typing up the resignation letter; which had been drafted by Alastair Campbell. This time there were no letters; he made a swift decision and fell on his sword. There were no tears in front of the cameras or last-ditch attempts to haul himself out of the hole.</p> <p>His resignation is a personal tragedy, but also a release. The assistance, though misguided, he offered to Srichand Hinduja came at a time when the London chatterati and powerful industrial figures pursued him relentlessly. He was undoubtedly enjoying the fruits of office. He may have sailed close to the wind, as he did on this occasion, but there is no evidence of any wrongdoing. On my watch I often questioned, as he did, whether he should be seeing this person or that. There was usually a good reason for the meetings, though appearances with the likes of Elle Macpherson might have been a photo-opportunity too far. His fondness for rightwing socialites also exposed him to accusations that he was turning his back on old friends, but Peter always had an explanation for his seemingly incongruous new chums: it was part of what was called the \"Hoover strategy\", an attempt to draw traditional Tories into the New Labour tent. It is a fact of life - often forgotten by old-fashioned liberals - that successful politicians come into contact with influential figures who occupy other arenas.</p> <p>In fact he largely turned his back on such company after his first resignation. He reluctantly sold his house, which was not half as glamorous as the Daily Mail would have you believe. He was quite happy to give up the parties that had kept him so busy in the 18 months after the 1997 election. Indeed over the past two years, when I have asked him how he's been and what he's been up to, he has often sounded rather proud of the fact that he has spent most evenings at home. The first time I called him at his flat in Hillsborough, he told me gleefully that he was \"just cooking some lamb chops and watching a video.\"</p> <p>His first few months out of office were a shock to the system. He particularly missed his chauffeur driven car. After selling his house, buying a secondhand Fiat Punto was the first big challenge of his new life. He also found clearing out his ministerial study in the Commons after Christmas a humiliating experience. But despite these indignities he came to relish his new freedom. At the 1999 Labour party conference he told a friend: \"It's great. I've just been sitting in my room watching the Cartoon Network.\" It was almost convincing.</p> <p>During his 10 months on the back benches he had kept in regular touch with Tony Blair, speaking to him about three times a week. It meant a lot to him during those wilderness months that Blair took care to keep him in the loop. Peter kept up a stream of regular memos to Downing Street, helping to draft speeches, particularly on Europe. He played a key role in securing the support of senior Tories like Clarke and Heseltine for the government's position on Europe.</p> <p>He had also helped Millbank campaigners in their early planning of the election campaign. His rare forays into the political arena had been met with praise by a number of surprising allies, from Sir Ken Jackson of the AEEU to old Labour colleagues. He occasionally spoke out in favour of Europe but actually spent more time attending Labour party meetings out of London.</p> <p>He never seriously entertained the idea of returning to the cabinet so early. However, he was delighted with his new role in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>Crucially his new job allowed him to maintain his new regime of avoiding the parties and dinners that many of his critics associated, as he would say, with \"Old Mandelson\". He had never been happier than when he was working in Hillsborough Castle grappling with fascinating and serious issues away from the Westminster village.</p> <p>He also had two new close friends to look after - his dogs. Bobby, a very excitable Labrador and Jack, a playful Parson Russell Terrier. Phonecalls that had previously been interrupted by bleeper messages from Number 10 were now stalled by shrieks as one or other of the puppies peed on the carpet.</p> <p>While in Belfast he would occasionally be dragged into stories from his past, for example last October when Geoffrey Robinson published his memoirs. In the main he was determined to keep out of trouble, which to a great extent he did.</p> <p>Seasoned New Labour kremlinologists suspected that Peter's power was weakened by his distance from Whitehall and the pressures of peace process. It's probably true that he didn't enjoy the influence he did at the height of his career but, he insisted, he was \"well out of it\" and pleased that his distant posting kept him out of trouble.</p> <p>This weekend \"Old Mandelson\" came back to haunt him. He was visiting Paris when the Observer called his office asking for a comment on the written parliamentary answer which Barbara Roche, the immigration minister, had given the Lib Dem MP Norman Baker, a long-time Peter tormentor. He was aware that the answer had been published after discussions with the Home Office last week.</p> <p>I was not surprised that a story about his relationship with the Hindujas had appeared in print. In my time I had often received telephone calls from them and was aware of their reputation. It was inevitable that Mandelson would have been drawn into the picture as the Indian criminal investigation into their businesses reached its closing stages.</p> <p>While working for him I had encountered many similar stories. The simplest response is always to establish the facts and give the least damaging, though truthful answer. Peter was annoyed by the Observer story, though not unduly concerned. The answer that he provided seemed strong enough. However, on this occasion something went wrong. So wrong that Alastair Campbell, one of his oldest friend's, misled the press and Chris Smith, the culture secretary, misled the Commons. How could Peter have got himself in such a mess?</p> <p>I do not believe he deliberately lied to the press; he provided an answer that was at best economical and at worst evasive. However, if he had been more open he would never have had to resign. It was also an error to highlight the role his private secretary had played, though it is easy to see why he wanted to put more daylight between him and the Hindujas. Nothing unusual about that; politicians are brought up to answer difficult questions in a way which reflect most positively on them. You see it every day on the television and nine times out of 10 the fudge does the trick - unfortunately for Peter, this time he came unstuck.</p> <p>I was asked countless times yesterday why a man in his position, with precious little political capital, took a chance like that. The answer is simply that Peter is a born gambler. That's why he was able to change the Labour party, and also why he was never going to survive at the top for long. He wore his appetite for risk-taking as a badge of honour. \"That's how I got where I am,\" he would say when asked why he seemed so willing to play with fire.</p> <p>While even he acknowledges that he was well and trully cornered yesterday morning - \"they [the media] got me,\" he said - it was still surprising to anyone who knows him that he went so quickly. During his stoic Commons performance yesterday he made little reference to his resignation - other than to talk in the past tense.</p> <p>His statement outside Downing Street was typically abrupt. There will be many who suspect he is simply spinning again, but I'm convinced that the reason for his swift resignation is that he is at last happy in his own personal life. Most importantly, his time in Belfast showed that high political office is not the only thing in life. \"I just realised that this can't go on for ever,\" he said last night.</p> <p>He has now withdrawn from the many battles he has fought since he first started to work with Neil Kinnock in 1985. He has lived with his critics inside the Labour party and often relished the argument. However the more recent attacks from rightwing commentators, particularly on Europe, have been little more than homophobic rants Richard Littlejohn and others in the Sun have been disgusting.</p> <p>I for one am pleased that he has retreated from the Whitehall fray. Indeed I made the case to him two years ago that he should turn his back on Westminster and find a more fulfilling (and possibly better remunerated) life outside politics. He told me then, as he did yesterday: \"I am a public servant.\" Though I've always chuckled when he delivers it, the statement has a ring of truth. More importantly, he was a better-organised and more efficient minister than many of his colleagues, though more abrasive than most. While he will move out of ministerial office, he currently has no plans to step down at the next election.</p> <p>Nowhere will his departure be mourned more than in the Northern Ireland Office and Millbank Tower. Civil servants and campaign staff respect his clear thought and swift decision-making, though they won't miss the occasional tantrums and unreasonable demands.

      "bodyText": "Telephone calls before 7am are usually bad news. I received one from Peter Mandelson at 6:30am on the day of his home loan resignation. He was more downcast then than he was yesterday morning when he called again, this time at 6:45am and remarkably upbeat. I was asleep when the phone rang. What's going on, I asked. \"I'll tell you exactly what's going on: I'm being attacked by the right and the left.\" He then gave an encyclopaedic breakdown of what had happened since the weekend. Despite the obvious pressure he seemed calm. Unlike our similar conversation two years ago, the idea of resignation never arose. On the face of it the passport story was not that serious. Peter acknowledged that the answer his office had given the Observer on Saturday afternoon had been unclear, though perhaps no more so than similar responses given by him or many of his colleagues to journalists over the years. The conversation ended with Peter's typical sign-off: \"Speak to you later.\" Yet in little more than five hours he had thrown in the towel and ended his career as a frontline politician. This was so different to my time with him in December 1998 when he clung on to ministerial office for as long as possible until the prime minister effectively asked him to resign. That time I had the surreal responsibility of typing up the resignation letter; which had been drafted by Alastair Campbell. This time there were no letters; he made a swift decision and fell on his sword. There were no tears in front of the cameras or last-ditch attempts to haul himself out of the hole. His resignation is a personal tragedy, but also a release. The assistance, though misguided, he offered to Srichand Hinduja came at a time when the London chatterati and powerful industrial figures pursued him relentlessly. He was undoubtedly enjoying the fruits of office. He may have sailed close to the wind, as he did on this occasion, but there is no evidence of any wrongdoing. On my watch I often questioned, as he did, whether he should be seeing this person or that. There was usually a good reason for the meetings, though appearances with the likes of Elle Macpherson might have been a photo-opportunity too far. His fondness for rightwing socialites also exposed him to accusations that he was turning his back on old friends, but Peter always had an explanation for his seemingly incongruous new chums: it was part of what was called the \"Hoover strategy\", an attempt to draw traditional Tories into the New Labour tent. It is a fact of life - often forgotten by old-fashioned liberals - that successful politicians come into contact with influential figures who occupy other arenas. In fact he largely turned his back on such company after his first resignation. He reluctantly sold his house, which was not half as glamorous as the Daily Mail would have you believe. He was quite happy to give up the parties that had kept him so busy in the 18 months after the 1997 election. Indeed over the past two years, when I have asked him how he's been and what he's been up to, he has often sounded rather proud of the fact that he has spent most evenings at home. The first time I called him at his flat in Hillsborough, he told me gleefully that he was \"just cooking some lamb chops and watching a video.\" His first few months out of office were a shock to the system. He particularly missed his chauffeur driven car. After selling his house, buying a secondhand Fiat Punto was the first big challenge of his new life. He also found clearing out his ministerial study in the Commons after Christmas a humiliating experience. But despite these indignities he came to relish his new freedom. At the 1999 Labour party conference he told a friend: \"It's great. I've just been sitting in my room watching the Cartoon Network.\" It was almost convincing. During his 10 months on the back benches he had kept in regular touch with Tony Blair, speaking to him about three times a week. It meant a lot to him during those wilderness months that Blair took care to keep him in the loop. Peter kept up a stream of regular memos to Downing Street, helping to draft speeches, particularly on Europe. He played a key role in securing the support of senior Tories like Clarke and Heseltine for the government's position on Europe. He had also helped Millbank campaigners in their early planning of the election campaign. His rare forays into the political arena had been met with praise by a number of surprising allies, from Sir Ken Jackson of the AEEU to old Labour colleagues. He occasionally spoke out in favour of Europe but actually spent more time attending Labour party meetings out of London. He never seriously entertained the idea of returning to the cabinet so early. However, he was delighted with his new role in Northern Ireland. Crucially his new job allowed him to maintain his new regime of avoiding the parties and dinners that many of his critics associated, as he would say, with \"Old Mandelson\". He had never been happier than when he was working in Hillsborough Castle grappling with fascinating and serious issues away from the Westminster village. He also had two new close friends to look after - his dogs. Bobby, a very excitable Labrador and Jack, a playful Parson Russell Terrier. Phonecalls that had previously been interrupted by bleeper messages from Number 10 were now stalled by shrieks as one or other of the puppies peed on the carpet. While in Belfast he would occasionally be dragged into stories from his past, for example last October when Geoffrey Robinson published his memoirs. In the main he was determined to keep out of trouble, which to a great extent he did. Seasoned New Labour kremlinologists suspected that Peter's power was weakened by his distance from Whitehall and the pressures of peace process. It's probably true that he didn't enjoy the influence he did at the height of his career but, he insisted, he was \"well out of it\" and pleased that his distant posting kept him out of trouble. This weekend \"Old Mandelson\" came back to haunt him. He was visiting Paris when the Observer called his office asking for a comment on the written parliamentary answer which Barbara Roche, the immigration minister, had given the Lib Dem MP Norman Baker, a long-time Peter tormentor. He was aware that the answer had been published after discussions with the Home Office last week. I was not surprised that a story about his relationship with the Hindujas had appeared in print. In my time I had often received telephone calls from them and was aware of their reputation. It was inevitable that Mandelson would have been drawn into the picture as the Indian criminal investigation into their businesses reached its closing stages. While working for him I had encountered many similar stories. The simplest response is always to establish the facts and give the least damaging, though truthful answer. Peter was annoyed by the Observer story, though not unduly concerned. The answer that he provided seemed strong enough. However, on this occasion something went wrong. So wrong that Alastair Campbell, one of his oldest friend's, misled the press and Chris Smith, the culture secretary, misled the Commons. How could Peter have got himself in such a mess? I do not believe he deliberately lied to the press; he provided an answer that was at best economical and at worst evasive. However, if he had been more open he would never have had to resign. It was also an error to highlight the role his private secretary had played, though it is easy to see why he wanted to put more daylight between him and the Hindujas. Nothing unusual about that; politicians are brought up to answer difficult questions in a way which reflect most positively on them. You see it every day on the television and nine times out of 10 the fudge does the trick - unfortunately for Peter, this time he came unstuck. I was asked countless times yesterday why a man in his position, with precious little political capital, took a chance like that. The answer is simply that Peter is a born gambler. That's why he was able to change the Labour party, and also why he was never going to survive at the top for long. He wore his appetite for risk-taking as a badge of honour. \"That's how I got where I am,\" he would say when asked why he seemed so willing to play with fire. While even he acknowledges that he was well and trully cornered yesterday morning - \"they [the media] got me,\" he said - it was still surprising to anyone who knows him that he went so quickly. During his stoic Commons performance yesterday he made little reference to his resignation - other than to talk in the past tense. His statement outside Downing Street was typically abrupt. There will be many who suspect he is simply spinning again, but I'm convinced that the reason for his swift resignation is that he is at last happy in his own personal life. Most importantly, his time in Belfast showed that high political office is not the only thing in life. \"I just realised that this can't go on for ever,\" he said last night. He has now withdrawn from the many battles he has fought since he first started to work with Neil Kinnock in 1985. He has lived with his critics inside the Labour party and often relished the argument. However the more recent attacks from rightwing commentators, particularly on Europe, have been little more than homophobic rants Richard Littlejohn and others in the Sun have been disgusting. I for one am pleased that he has retreated from the Whitehall fray. Indeed I made the case to him two years ago that he should turn his back on Westminster and find a more fulfilling (and possibly better remunerated) life outside politics. He told me then, as he did yesterday: \"I am a public servant.\" Though I've always chuckled when he delivers it, the statement has a ring of truth. More importantly, he was a better-organised and more efficient minister than many of his colleagues, though more abrasive than most. While he will move out of ministerial office, he currently has no plans to step down at the next election. Nowhere will his departure be mourned more than in the Northern Ireland Office and Millbank Tower. Civil servants and campaign staff respect his clear thought and swift decision-making, though they won't miss the occasional tantrums and unreasonable demands. While the peace process will continue and the election campaign will roll on his influence will be missing and his successors will not live up to his reputation. After a little time I suspect his enemies will miss him too. He took them on singlehandly, faced them down and gave them a bloody good run for their money. \u0095 Benjamin Wegg-Prosser was an aide to Peter Mandelson from 1995-1998.

Without an action plan UK farmers will continue to lose out to overseas competitors.\" A Friends of the Earth food campaigner, Sandra Bell, said: \"We are disappointed that the committee's report falls short of recommending targets for organic farming. \"However, it contains some sound advice, not least that a more strategic approach is needed to develop the organic sector and more resources should be put into training and research to maximise the considerable benefits of organic farming.\" Patrick Holden, director of the Soil Association, said \"With British agriculture facing such a serious crisis of environmental damage, food scares, the decline of rural employment and thousands of farmers on the brink of bankruptcy, organic farming does seem to be the one ray of hope. \"The question is whether the government can play a more positive role in enabling the expansion of organic farming. That would send a signal to farmers that there is a better long-term security in organic production.\"",

Visiting Ealing police station in west London, where she was held for 28 days in the autumn of 1970 after an attempt to commandeer an El Al flight, Ms Khaled said the peace process had failed to solve the Palestinian problem and predicted an intensification of the uprising against Israel. Ministers intervened to give the go-ahead for a last minute visa for the Haifa-born revolutionary and member of the Palestinian parliament, who was due to speak last night at a Westminster meeting on Iraq and Palestine organised by the Labour MP George Galloway. Ms Khaled was at the centre of an international crisis which engulfed Edward Heath's government in September 1970, sparked by the seizure of five civilian airliners by the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The PFLP blew up three of the aircraft for cameras in the Jordanian desert and bargained for the release of seven Palestinian prisoners, including Ms Khaled, who was handed over to British authorities at Heathrow by Israeli guards after the failed hijacking. Speaking to the Guardian after her return to London yesterday, Ms Khaled defended her role in the hijackings - she also successfully hijacked a TWA airliner in 1969 - which made her a heroine in the Middle East. \"Until then, the world only dealt with us as refugees.

A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed last night that Peter Hain, the minister in charge of Middle East affairs, had intervened in the case at the request of Mr Galloway and that the government was satisfied that there was \"now no reason why she shouldn't be allowed into the country\".

      "body": "<b> Friday January 19</b> <p>Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker receives a written Home Office answer, dated the previous day, on applications for British passports by Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja. Immigration minister Barbara Roche confirms that Mr Mandelson, when minister for the dome, \"made inquiries about how an application might be viewed given the government's wider policy of encouraging citizenship from long-standing residents who fulfilled the criteria.\" </p> <p><b> Saturday January 20</b> </p> <p>Mr Mandelson plays down his role, telling the Observer: \"To the limited extent that I was involved in this matter, I was always very sensitive to the proprieties. The matter was dealt with by my private secretary. At no time did I support or endorse this application for citizenship.\" </p> <p><b> Sunday January 21</b> </p> <p>As the Observer's story is followed up, the Northern Ireland office insists: \"Mr Mandelson did not assist in this passport application. He did not support or endorse any passport application, nor would he have considered doing so.\" </p> <p><b> Monday January 22</b> </p> <p>The prime minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell, tells journalists: \"This was an issue raised by the Hindujas and it was passed to the Home Office and when specifically they asked Peter to endorse or support any application, he refused, perfectly properly and appropriately.

      "bodyText": "Friday January 19 Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker receives a written Home Office answer, dated the previous day, on applications for British passports by Srichand and Gopichand Hinduja. Immigration minister Barbara Roche confirms that Mr Mandelson, when minister for the dome, \"made inquiries about how an application might be viewed given the government's wider policy of encouraging citizenship from long-standing residents who fulfilled the criteria.\" Saturday January 20 Mr Mandelson plays down his role, telling the Observer: \"To the limited extent that I was involved in this matter, I was always very sensitive to the proprieties. The matter was dealt with by my private secretary. At no time did I support or endorse this application for citizenship.\" Sunday January 21 As the Observer's story is followed up, the Northern Ireland office insists: \"Mr Mandelson did not assist in this passport application. He did not support or endorse any passport application, nor would he have considered doing so.\" Monday January 22 The prime minister's official spokesman, Alastair Campbell, tells journalists: \"This was an issue raised by the Hindujas and it was passed to the Home Office and when specifically they asked Peter to endorse or support any application, he refused, perfectly properly and appropriately. He did exactly what any other minister would do, which is pass it to the relevant department, which is the Home Office. Peter did not get involved.\" In the afternoon, during culture questions, the culture minister, Chris Smith, dismisses calls from Mr Baker for an inquiry - reiterating that it was Mr Mandelson's private secretary, not the minister, who contacted the Home Office.

Perhaps one or more paced around the office while the details of the process were hammered out.</p> <p>In 1998 Mr Blair had needed to lead his friend to the conclusion that he must quit rather than brazen it out. This time both men knew that there was no way out.</p> <p>Circumstance had not helped. For a start, they were both set to face fierce questioning in the Commons within a few hours, first during Northern Ireland question time then at the prime minister's own inquisition. They knew the Tories would be on the rampage. There was no chance the matter would blow itself out.</p> <p>Then there was the general election. If there might have been a lingering trace of uncertainty, an appraisal from Mr Campbell of how the controversy was playing in the media must surely have persuaded them that the status quo was not an option.</p> <p>During the hour-long meeting, Mr Blair asked Mr Mandelson to tell him in depth what had happened so that he would be prepared for William Hague's inevitable questions. They also decided that they should ask a QC to carry out an inquiry.</p> <p>They also decided not to exchange public letters of resignation and acceptance, as happened two years ago. Instead Mr Mandelson would make a statement outside Number 10 and Mr Blair would have his say during question time.</p> <p>After half an hour, Mr Campbell left to attend the daily briefing for lobby journalists in the Number 10 basement. He is often a little tardy but his arrival 15 minutes late added to the feeling that something very big was about to break.</p> <p>Mr Campbell is not good at hiding his feelings and it was clear he was either angry or upset. He confirmed that the meeting between Mr Blair and Mr Mandelson was underway, that things had to be \"ironed out\". By now there could be little mistake - for the second time Mr Blair's close confidant was on his way out.</p> <p>Earlier, a bright, cloudless sky would have greeted Mr Mandelson if he had peeked out of the windows of his \u00a3249,000 two-bedroomed flat in an elegant Edwardian villa just off Notting Hill Gate yesterday morning. If he had glanced down, he would also have seen a pack of reporters, photographers and television crews ready to record the start of his last day as Northern Ireland minister.</p> <p>The newspapers gave him little solace. \"How many more lies Mr Mandelson,\" asked the Mail. \"Mandy told a porky\" claimed the Sun. Perhaps prompted by the cruel headlines, he was later to take a swipe at media scrutiny.</p> <p>There was no sign of life chez Mandelson before 9.30am. Then a female assistant arrived to take Mr Mandelson's dogs, golden retriever Bobby and terrier Jack, for a walk. A normal day for them, so different for their master.</p> <p><b>Speculation</b><br></p> <p>Just before 10am Mr Mandelson's ministerial blue Jaguar pulled up. He was waiting just inside the black front door - a more modest version of 10 Downing Street - and strode down the steps as the car came to a halt, clutching two red boxes.</p> <p>There was no smile and no comment as a security officer ushered him into the back of the car, which was shadowed by a silver four-wheel drive carrying two more security officers. At 10.30am Mr Mandelson's car was spotted at the rear of Downing Street, fuelling speculation that he was on the brink of resignation.</p> <p>Back at Mr Mandelson's house, a Rastafarian cycled by shouting: \"Is this where you get the passports?\"</p> <p>The political pack outside Downing Street were speculating that Mr Mandelson had sneaked out of a back door when his spokesman, Tom Kelly, emerged to say that his boss would be out shortly.</p> <p>At 1.33pm the famous black door swung open and Mr Mandelson strode over to face the cameras.</p> <p>Wearing a blue suit, pale blue shirt and dark patterned tie, Mr Mandelson fingered a stray lock of his hair which a troublesome breeze was toying with.</p> <p>Last time, red rings around his eyes showed that the ordeal of resignation had reduced Mr Mandelson to tears. This time he appeared determined to keep his emotions in check.</p> <p>He began reading his resignation statement strongly, confidently, but his voice faltered as he insisted that his \"sole desire\" had been to emphasise that he had not sought to influence the Home Office over the passport application. The emotion came when he turned to the role of the press. He licked his lips nervously and his voice cracked as he said: \"There must be more to politics than the constant media pressure and exposure that has dogged me.\" He was back in his stride and even managed a half smile when he said that he wanted a \"more normal life\".</p> <p>Unfortunately, when he had finished, he turned the wrong way as he looked for his car, heading back towards Number 10 before spinning almost 360 degrees when he realised his car was further up Downing Street.</p> <p>At 2.30pm Mr Mandelson rose from the government front bench and buttoned his jacket up to answer questions about the RUC. His deputy Adam Ingram sat next to him, but not too closely. He flicked through papers as David Trimble thanked him for his work in Northern Ireland and ignored a question about his resignation.</p> <p>Then he sat at Tony Blair's right hand - perhaps for the last time - for prime minister's questions. Mr Mandelson sat arms crossed as the onslaught from William Hague began. When Mr Blair sat down he did not lean back beside his friend but perched on the front of the bench. At one point Mr Mandelson whispered something to the prime minister and managed a \"hear hear\" when Mr Blair attacked the Tories over rural schools. But for the most part remained impassive, even when his friend paid warm tribute to him.</p> <p>Half an hour after question time Mr Mandelson was at the Northern Ireland office to clear his desk.</p> <p>Back at the Mandelson home, a male assistant called to take the dogs out. Then at 4.15 Mr Mandelson's partner Reinaldo Da Silva carried two bags into a chauffeur-driven car. They drove out of the street, picked up the dogs and were away.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson's immediate plans were unclear. But already by last night the Northern Ireland office had moved on, replying to questions about his movements with a curt: \"Mr Mandelson is now a private citizen. His privacy is his own.\"</p> <p><b>Full text</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">The resignation speech</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/nireland/\">Northern Ireland</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Mandelson: a career in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">Peter Mandelson announces his resignation (3mins 30)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124white.ra\">Michael White at Westminster (2mins 14)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/  news/politics/0124wainwright.ra\">Martin Wainwright in Hartlepool (3mins 55)</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427479,00.html\">24.01.2001: Mandelson resigns</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427569,00.html\">24.01.2001: Blair backs 'courageous' Mandelson </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427562,00.html\">24.01.2001: Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: the Mandelson I knew</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427481,00.html\">24.01.2001: Analysis by Nicholas Watt - Farewell Mandelson, brilliant but unloved</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427491,00.html\">24.01.2001: Fish and sympathy from Mandelson's Hartlepool constituency</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427558,00.html\">24.01.2001: Analysis: Resignation upsets pot as Irish stew </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427475,00.html\">24.01.2001: The hands-on Hindujas</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,427264,00.html\">Profile: Srichand Hinduja</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427465,00.html\">24.01.2001: Passport row lands Mandelson in trouble</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,427417,00.html\">Steve Bell on Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e6ee\">Have your say: should Mandelson have quit?</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number-10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageID=3291\" target=\"_new\">Press briefing</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nio.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Northern Ireland Office</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a><br><a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Belfast Telegraph</a></p>",

At 1.33pm the famous black door swung open and Mr Mandelson strode over to face the cameras. Wearing a blue suit, pale blue shirt and dark patterned tie, Mr Mandelson fingered a stray lock of his hair which a troublesome breeze was toying with. Last time, red rings around his eyes showed that the ordeal of resignation had reduced Mr Mandelson to tears. This time he appeared determined to keep his emotions in check. He began reading his resignation statement strongly, confidently, but his voice faltered as he insisted that his \"sole desire\" had been to emphasise that he had not sought to influence the Home Office over the passport application. The emotion came when he turned to the role of the press. He licked his lips nervously and his voice cracked as he said: \"There must be more to politics than the constant media pressure and exposure that has dogged me.\" He was back in his stride and even managed a half smile when he said that he wanted a \"more normal life\". Unfortunately, when he had finished, he turned the wrong way as he looked for his car, heading back towards Number 10 before spinning almost 360 degrees when he realised his car was further up Downing Street. At 2.30pm Mr Mandelson rose from the government front bench and buttoned his jacket up to answer questions about the RUC. His deputy Adam Ingram sat next to him, but not too closely. He flicked through papers as David Trimble thanked him for his work in Northern Ireland and ignored a question about his resignation. Then he sat at Tony Blair's right hand - perhaps for the last time - for prime minister's questions. Mr Mandelson sat arms crossed as the onslaught from William Hague began. When Mr Blair sat down he did not lean back beside his friend but perched on the front of the bench. At one point Mr Mandelson whispered something to the prime minister and managed a \"hear hear\" when Mr Blair attacked the Tories over rural schools. But for the most part remained impassive, even when his friend paid warm tribute to him. Half an hour after question time Mr Mandelson was at the Northern Ireland office to clear his desk. Back at the Mandelson home, a male assistant called to take the dogs out. Then at 4.15 Mr Mandelson's partner Reinaldo Da Silva carried two bags into a chauffeur-driven car. They drove out of the street, picked up the dogs and were away. Mr Mandelson's immediate plans were unclear. But already by last night the Northern Ireland office had moved on, replying to questions about his movements with a curt: \"Mr Mandelson is now a private citizen. His privacy is his own.\" Full text The resignation speech Special reports New Labour in power Northern Ireland Photo gallery Mandelson: a career in pictures Audio Peter Mandelson announces his resignation (3mins 30) Michael White at Westminster (2mins 14) Martin Wainwright in Hartlepool (3mins 55) Related articles 24.01.2001: Mandelson resigns 24.01.2001: Blair backs 'courageous' Mandelson 24.01.2001: Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: the Mandelson I knew 24.01.2001: Analysis by Nicholas Watt - Farewell Mandelson, brilliant but unloved 24.01.2001: Fish and sympathy from Mandelson's Hartlepool constituency 24.01.2001: Analysis: Resignation upsets pot as Irish stew 24.01.2001: The hands-on Hindujas Profile: Srichand Hinduja 24.01.2001: Passport row lands Mandelson in trouble Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour Mandelson resigns over his home loan Rivals in the Labour party How Mandy replaced Mo Cartoon Steve Bell on Peter Mandelson Talk about it Have your say: should Mandelson have quit?

Ms Bahl, 44, a former chairman of the equal opportunities commission, denies that she was a bully and accuses the society of discrimination in the way it handled the allegations. The hearing continues today.",

      "bodyText": "Scotland's coalition administration was under threat last night after the first minister, Henry McLeish, failed to offer free long-term care for the elderly. Mr McLeish had hinted he would implement in full the Sutherland royal commission recommendatons on funding of this care, creating the biggest policy rift to date between Holyrood and Westminster. Yesterday Susan Deacon, the executive's health minister, announced a care package for the elderly that stopped short of the universal free care recommended by the commission, chaired by Sir Stewart Sutherland. Pensioners' groups and opposition parties accused Mr McLeish of betraying devolution for Downing Street. Ten Liberal Democrat MSPs tabled a motion calling for an unequivocal commitment to free care for all, and efforts were under way last night to force a debate on the issue in the parliament. Under the proposals announced by Ms Deacon, free personal care will be extended to cover people suffering from dementia; a development group will be set up to make further recommendations on elderly care; and a single needs assessment scheme will be adopted. She said that she was offering Scotland's elderly a new deal, and claimed that many more would receive free nursing and personal care. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish National party health spokesman, said the minister and Mr McLeish had sold out. It has been reported that Downing Street was dismayed by Mr McLeish's plans and put pressure on him not to adopt a vastly superior care package to that provided to the rest of Britain, where nursing care is free but personal care is means tested. \"All of this comes after three months of Scotland being led to believe by the first minister that his government would implement Sutherland in full, but today we are being told that is not what he said,\" said Ms Sturgeon. \"It seems the only people that didn't agree with this was London Labour, and when faced with the choice of doing what is right by Scotland or appeasing London Labour, this government will always choose keeping London sweet, and let Scotland down.\" Ms Deacon denied that the executive had bowed to pressure, saying: \"We are here to deliver policies and solutions which meet Scotland's needs.\" To jeers and shouts from the opposition benches, she added: \"We will not make promises that we know we cannot keep.\" Margaret Smith, Liberal Democrat MSP and convener of the health committee that unanimously backed full implementation of the Sutherland recommendations, said her party intended to keep forcing the issue. Its motion demanded a commitment to free care and a timetable in which to achieve it. \"The question now is: is Mr McLeish on London's leash, or is he on this government's leash?\" she said. When it was suggested that her actions might lead to a defeat for the executive and possibly the end of the Labour-Lib Dem coalition, Mrs Smith said she did not see why that should be the case. If the motion was endorsed by the parliament, she said, \"That will be the will of the parliament being exercised, and I think that would be a good day for this parliament.\"",

I would like to pay the warmest possible tribute to him for the tireless efforts he has made in securing peace in Northern Ireland and also for his personal courage and sense of duty in coming to the house this afternoon to answer questions on Northern Ireland before departing the government.\"</p> <p><b>William Hague:</b> \"Now you've notched up the historic achievement of being forced to sack the same minister for the same offence, twice in 25 months, do you recognise that your career-long dependency on Mr Mandelson has been a monumental error of judgment?\"</p> <p><b>Blair:</b> \"I don't suppose I ever expected you to behave graciously at all over his resignation. But I believe that the job that Mr Mandelson has done in Northern Ireland well merited his position as secretary of state.</p> <p>\"I think he has made an enormous contribution to it (the peace process). Indeed, I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that I doubt the process in Northern Ireland would have been sustained so well, except with his commitment. I therefore believe it was right that he occupied that position and I also believe that he is a bigger man than many of his critics.\"</p> <p><b>Hague:</b> \"The fact is that to reappoint in September 1999 a disgraced minister 10 months after he was forced to resign, in breach of every convention and precedent, was a demonstration of the arrogance with which you wield your power. To spare yourself and the country going through this a third time, will you now guarantee that Mr Mandelson will not be running the election campaign of the Labour party and will not return to office in any government led by you?\"</p> <p><b>Blair:</b> \"Mr Mandelson has already made that clear in the statement he made earlier. I think that he has done the right thing. I think he has done the honourable thing. It is a long tradition in this house that when someone does do that, we pay tribute to it. I am only sorry that once again you have lived down to my expectations.\"</p> <p><b>Hague:</b> \"Mr Mandelson has done the right thing, but it's a pity your judgment led him to have to do it twice within the space of one parliament. Doesn't this go wider... because Mr Mandelson has been central to everything you have done. It was Mr Mandelson who picked you out, who briefed the press for you, who stabbed the chancellor (Gordon Brown) in the back for you, who spun all of your campaigns for you.</p> <p>\"The fact that his statement sadly could not be relied upon is not only the reason he has had to go, but it is the reason that he has been at the heart of the entire New Labour project.\"</p> <p><b>Blair:</b> \"I repeat that I believe it was the right thing for him to do, that he came back into government as the Northern Ireland secretary.

      "body": "<p>Six years ago, on the Tuesday evening of the Labour party conference, I was a guest at a party in Tony Blair's Brighton hotel room. Earlier that day, the prime minister (as he was soon to become) had made the best speech of his then brief leadership. So, as is the habit on such occasions, the assembled company took it in turns to congratulate him on his eloquence. One of our number, fearing that all the most convincing compliments had been exhausted, expressed his gratitude that the hand of friendship had been held out to old Labour. Peter Mandelson immediately took centre stage. \"Let's get it clear,\" he said. \"No room for old Labour, but a welcome to old Labour individuals who realise they have to change\".</p> <p>I felt a momentary fury. Then irritation at his impertinence combined with amusement at his presumption and disbelief that anyone who claimed to possess such acute political antennae could imagine that egalitarian socialism would quietly fade away. Looking back, I realise that I was witnessing an exhibition of the fatal flaw which yesterday made Peter Mandelson fall like Lucifer. The Greeks had a word for it. That word is hubris. It is the quality which lay at the heart of all the Mandelson mistakes and made his fate inevitable. He believed that he was above the rules of personal discipline and public conduct which constrained his colleagues. So he made mistakes which a more humble man would have avoided.</p> <p>None of the mistakes were inherently unforgivable. Borrowing \u00a3300,000 from Geoffrey Robinson was not a heinous crime. It was absurd to suggest that the Legacy Consortium had become preferred purchaser of the Greenwich dome because the company chairman's wife gave a party to celebrate Peter Mandelson's birthday. And I am perfectly prepared to believe that his telephone call to the Home Office was an indication of interest in the Hinduja brothers' passport application rather than an attempt to persuade ministers to behave improperly. But his explanations invariably contain so much extraneous detail that the facts are sometimes difficult to detect. The problem was the frequency, not the size, of his indiscretions - and his belief that he could brush them aside as minor obstacles in his path to greatness.</p> <p>A byproduct of that attitude was Peter Mandelson's almost total lack of political friends. When a cabinet minister is in trouble he needs the support of backbenchers, not the sort of people who were Mandelson's preferred companions. I have, in my time, organised MPs telephone calls to Downing Street in support of a beleaguered secretary of state. Lady Powell - wife of Margaret Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and apparently one of Mandelson's favourite society hostesses - cannot provide the same service.</p> <p>There is no doubt that Mandelson was a first-class minister who fully deserved the tribute which the prime minister paid him for the work he did in Northern Ireland. Perhaps he was too good - or at least so good that he thought that his ability was a protection against all adversity. In politics it never is. So in the end he was destroyed by his own arrogance.</p> <p>Until yesterday, I always assumed that another consequence of that dangerous characteristic would be his undoing. He felt little instinctive loyalty to colleagues with whom he had nothing in common except Labour party membership. There are at least half a dozen cabinet ministers who believe, with good cause, that Peter Mandelson regularly briefed compliant journalists about their supposed incompetence. And as many have been infuriated by his willingness to speak, often against official policy, on matters outside his departmental concern. I suspect that he enjoyed living dangerously. He has fallen off the high wire.</p> <p>The prime minister's response to the mini-crisis which Mandelson has caused was impeccable. Regret, mixed with determination to protect the government's reputation, was the right note to strike. No doubt William Hague enjoyed his moment of Schadenfreude. But party leaders have not much to gain from behaving like starved terriers who has at last got his teeth into a mouldy bone. Nothing that happened yesterday will have much influence on the outcome of the general election. It ought, however, to have an influence on Tony Blair.</p> <p>Peter Mandelson's rise and fall were built on the belief that the Labour party could be converted into no more than a vehicle for propelling men and women of talent into the government of the country. He had no time for its tradition, prejudices, foibles and weaknesses and believed that it had to be taught continual lessons about the need to embrace new values. So he behaved in a way which would have been acceptable in a director of a limited company. But politics is more than running the UK PLC. If Peter Mandelson had realised that, he would still be the secretary of state for Northern Ireland. As it is, he is lost to politics forever.</p> <p><b>Full text</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">The resignation speech</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/nireland/\">Northern Ireland</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Mandelson: a career in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">Peter Mandelson announces his resignation (3mins 30)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124white.ra\">Michael White at Westminster (2mins 14)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/  news/politics/0124wainwright.ra\">Martin Wainwright in Hartlepool (3mins 55)</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427479,00.html\">24.01.2001: Mandelson resigns</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427569,00.html\">24.01.2001: Blair backs 'courageous' Mandelson </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427562,00.html\">24.01.2001: Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: the Mandelson I knew</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427481,00.html\">24.01.2001: Analysis by Nicholas Watt - Farewell Mandelson, brilliant but unloved</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427491,00.html\">24.01.2001: Fish and sympathy from Mandelson's Hartlepool constituency</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427558,00.html\">24.01.2001: Analysis: Resignation upsets pot as Irish stew </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427475,00.html\">24.01.2001: The hands-on Hindujas</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,427264,00.html\">Profile: Srichand Hinduja</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427465,00.html\">24.01.2001: Passport row lands Mandelson in trouble</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,427417,00.html\">Steve Bell on Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e6ee\">Have your say: should Mandelson have quit?</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number-10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageID=3291\" target=\"_new\">Press briefing</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nio.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Northern Ireland Office</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a><br><a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Belfast Telegraph</a></p>",

The effect of that is that cabinets can leap in the air and make an enormous bang, which is really quite a frightening experience.\" Although the problem has only emerged in a few units, Mr Myerscough said it was \"not a niggle but a fundamental issue\". Mr Myerscough said Mr Austin felt \"personally responsible\" for the debacle and had abruptly quit. The setback is Monotub's second in three months. It had planned to launch Titan by the end of last year but problems with water seals prompted a delay until February.",

There is no way round this. This is a critical situation.\" </p> <p>An area from north of Scotland to the east of England will be closed to trawlermen who take cod, haddock and whiting in the same nets. Cod stocks have fallen to their lowest levels in the last hundred years and quotas for the white fish were cut by as much as 40% by EU fisheries ministers last month. </p> <p>Supplies to consumers will not be hit by the ban because the big buyers get most of their fish from outside the North sea. Today they are launching the Frozen at Sea Fillets Association to restore confidence in the industry. </p> <p>The North sea ban will last from mid-February until the end of April - the crucial spawning period for cod and will be rigorously policed. Some fishermen will be allowed into the so-called \"controlled zone\" - namely those on the look out for species which swim at higher levels such as mackerel. But they will have to put up with on-board observers making sure that they do not catch any cod. </p> <p>Commission officials said yesterday that they were also considering bringing in a similar scheme for hake and made it clear that shutting off large parts of the North sea for cod fishermen could be an annual event. A five-year plan for stock recovery is being developed and will be put to ministers in June. If stocks recover the North sea could produce more than 10 times as many fish as were caught last year. </p> <p>Norway, which manages North sea fishing along with the EU, has already agreed to the plan which also includes other emergency measures such as forcing fishermen to apply for special permits and reporting what they catch in greater detail. </p> <p>The UK has been heavily involved in negotiations. \"I welcome this conservation initiative. Taken together with the big cuts in cod fishing effort agreed at December's fisheries council in Brussels this is the most significant conservation measure since the common fisheries policy was set up in 1983,\" said fisheries minister Elliot Morley. </p> <p>Other measures such as forcing fishermen to use special meshed nets, which allow juvenile cod to escape, are likely to be agreed shortly, he added. </p> <p>But Mike Park, chairman of the Scottish White Fish Producers' Association, claimed the plan was too harsh and called for government compensation. </p> <p>\"If the fleet were affluent just now, this measure would seem fine. But the fleet is just managing to exist at the moment. By the end of April we are going to see several casualties in the industry.\" </p> <p>WWF joined the fishermen in asking for compensation to tide the fleet over. It said: \"We feel for the fishermen but this is a positive step in the right direction.\" </p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/fish/story/0,7369,420713,00.html\">11.01.2001: Prince backs label to conserve fish</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/fish/story/0,7369,411756,00.html\">15.12.2001: Cod quotas reduced to an all-time low </a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/fish/story/0,7369,369534,00.html\">17.09.2000: Mediterranean fish colonise North Sea</a></p> <p><strong>Interactive guides</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,351825,00.html\">Fish farming</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/flash/0,5860,351828,00.html\">Go fishing!</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/s-enviro/stresses/3abs-removals/3fishing/3-3b.html\">Environment Agency's estimates of fish stocks</a> <br><a href=\"http://odin.dep.no/md/html/conf/map/\">Fishing areas in the North Sea</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.nffo.org.uk/\">National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations</a> <br><a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/comm/dgs/fisheries/index_en.htm\">EU fisheries directorate general</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.stemnet.nf.ca/cod/history4.htm\">Cod - a matter of survival</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/cm199899/cmselect/cmagric/141/14102.htm\">www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk</a><br> Agriculture committee fisheries report, July 1999 <a href=\"http://www.wwf-uk.org/orca\">www.wwf-uk.org/orca</a> <br>WWF Oceans Recovery Campaign <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/fi\">www.fao.org/fi</a> <br>UN Food and Agriculture Organisation: fisheries</p>",

But they will have to put up with on-board observers making sure that they do not catch any cod. Commission officials said yesterday that they were also considering bringing in a similar scheme for hake and made it clear that shutting off large parts of the North sea for cod fishermen could be an annual event. A five-year plan for stock recovery is being developed and will be put to ministers in June. If stocks recover the North sea could produce more than 10 times as many fish as were caught last year. Norway, which manages North sea fishing along with the EU, has already agreed to the plan which also includes other emergency measures such as forcing fishermen to apply for special permits and reporting what they catch in greater detail. The UK has been heavily involved in negotiations. \"I welcome this conservation initiative. Taken together with the big cuts in cod fishing effort agreed at December's fisheries council in Brussels this is the most significant conservation measure since the common fisheries policy was set up in 1983,\" said fisheries minister Elliot Morley. Other measures such as forcing fishermen to use special meshed nets, which allow juvenile cod to escape, are likely to be agreed shortly, he added. But Mike Park, chairman of the Scottish White Fish Producers' Association, claimed the plan was too harsh and called for government compensation. \"If the fleet were affluent just now, this measure would seem fine. But the fleet is just managing to exist at the moment. By the end of April we are going to see several casualties in the industry.\" WWF joined the fishermen in asking for compensation to tide the fleet over. It said: \"We feel for the fishermen but this is a positive step in the right direction.\" Related articles 11.01.2001: Prince backs label to conserve fish 15.12.2001: Cod quotas reduced to an all-time low 17.09.2000: Mediterranean fish colonise North Sea Interactive guides Fish farming Go fishing!

Radio chat shows spent hours discussing the final moments of Motti Dayan, 27, and Etgar Zeituni, 36, cousins and business partners. Their death on Tuesday brought a temporary halt to the peace talks. The Palestinian negotiators spent yesterday on their own at the Red Sea resort of Taba, waiting to hear whether the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, would send his team back to the talks soon. Mr Barak called a cabinet meeting last night to make the decision. The talks could resume today, after the two men are buried. But with less than two weeks to go until Israel votes for a new prime minister, Mr Barak may be calculating that there is no advantage in keeping them going. His advisers admit that he is going through the motions of talks to polish his image as a peacemaker before the vote on February 6, and with Israelis steeling themselves against further compromises to the Palestinians he may change his strategy. On radio chat shows and in parliament Israelis strove to understand how two Tel Aviv restaurateurs could have been so oblivious to the explosive situation less than an hour's drive from the coastal capital that they went shopping for bargains in the West Bank. Although the Palestinian uprising seeped into the coastal area weeks ago with the bus bombings in Tel Aviv and Netanya, the toll of more than 370 deaths had little impact on Sheinkin Street, a strip of cafes and boutiques which is the preserve of body-piercing bohemians who would rather talk about the beach than politics. Yesterday, as death notices were pasted in the windows of Yuppies, the cafe the men jointly owned, a handful of rightwing protesters arrived to jeer at the quarter's habitues for ever believing there could be peace with the Palestinians. Friends of the two men also had their doubts. \"Etgar had a lot of Arab Israeli friends. He believed in peace and coexistence, but he seems to have been wrong,\" a woman called Irit told Yediot. The two men visited the West Bank town of Tulkarem with an Israeli Arab business colleague to stock up on pots and plants for their cafe, taking advantage of the lower prices in the West Bank. They were marched away from a restaurant at gunpoint by four masked men and shot dead. The military wing of the Islamist group Hamas said it killed them. Since the uprising began in late September, Israeli citizens have been forbidden to visit the West Bank. It is easy to get around the ban and the army roadblocks, but very few Israeli reporters have bothered. Local press coverage of the uprising has been based overwhelmingly on government and army sources. Although the killing of the two cafe owners was the main story yesterday, no one linked their death with the murder of a middle-aged Palestinian dentist, Thabet Thabet, by the Israeli security forces in Tulkarem on January 1. There was little attention paid either to the Palestinian woman who died of a heart attack yesterday when Israeli soldiers at a checkpoint stopped the car taking her to hospital. Aisha Abdel-Karim Nassar, 28, was detained for 45 minutes at the checkpoint near Ramallah and died there, said Moussa Abu Hmeid, the director of West Bank hospitals. Despite such media self-censorship, the army said there was no excuse for casual outings to the West Bank. \"Whoever does not understand the reality here of the last four months has been out of the country or has not left the house,\" Brigadier Ron Kitrey said.",

      "byline": "Leader",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was not his warm relationship with the Hinduja brothers which did for him; the Blairs themselves were scarcely less friendly. It was not his readiness to lift the phone and courteously check a detail or two with the Home Office on Srichand Hinduja's behalf. That was survivable. Nor was it some sleazy deal to speed Mr Hiduja's passport application on its way and take, in return, a large sum for funding the dome: all sides deny that any such deal was done, and no proof has been adduced for it. It was not even his addiction to the company of fashionable people and people loaded with money - an addiction which seemed to be under better control after the Geoffrey Robinson crisis, but which none the less persisted.</p> <p>No, what did for Peter Mandelson in the end was the defect which so many had identified in him over the years, and which Tony Blair, his friend and his shield and comforter in times of trouble, had so often been warned against by good friends of Labour's best interests - his apparently incurable deviousness.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson has left the government for the second time - and very likely, for good - because he did not come clean. When the Observer talked to him on Saturday before publishing its report about Srichand Hinduja's passport application, his version seemed straightforward enough: \"The matter was dealt with by my private secretary. At no time did I support or endorse this application for citizenship.\" But by Tuesday, the prime minister's press spokesman was having to alter that story. Now Mr Mandelson had after all been involved - though only to the extent of a two-minute call to his Home Office colleague, Mike O'Brien. That phone call, we were assured, had somehow slipped Mr Mandelson's mind. But on Tuesday night, a further version surfaced. Mr Mandelson denied having said he had forgotten the phone call: \"Nobody asked me about a phone call on Saturday, Sunday or Monday. Nobody asked me these questions.\"</p> <p>Alastair Campbell's undisguisedly angry Downing Street briefing signalled the end. Both he and his colleague Chris Smith had been badly misled and on the basis of wrong information had made false statements themselves. And fatally, by failing to come clean to Alastair Campbell, Mr Mandelson had done something unforgivable: he had failed to come clean with the prime minister. Especially after the Robinson crisis, he had every cause to know better. Twice in the past few weeks, first in the context of its embarrassment over donations to party funds, then in that of the MoD's shifty handling of the row over depleted uranium, we have recommended this precept for people in government: at times like this, do not try to wriggle your way out of trouble; come as clean as you can, as soon as you can. Had Mr Mandelson adopted that course right from the time the Observer phoned him, he would still have had a horrible week, but he might still have a worthwhile career in politics ahead of him now.</p> <p>Because this strand of deviousness links the two cases, what happened yesterday is bound to revive the question of whether Tony Blair was right to recall him to government a mere 10 months after his last expulsion. Ever since he won the leadership, Mr Blair has depended heavily - often too heavily - on Mr Mandelson's friendship and guidance. He has called him his rock and counsellor. He once joked that the New Labour project would not be complete until the party learned to love Peter. When Mr Mandelson had to resign over the Robinson loan, Mr Blair could not disguise his distress, and emphasised right from the start how much he looked forward to welcoming his errant minister back. To stand by a friend in trouble is a virtuous act in anyone, and not to be disparaged. But prime ministers need to be critical, for if they are not, they find themselves in the kind of predicament Mr Blair is mired in today. His dependence on Mr Mandelson had even threatened the party with an election campaign managed by two astute politicians who can barely stand the sight of each other - Mr Mandelson and the chancellor, Gordon Brown. That was never a sensible notion, and at least Mr Mandelson's going will spare Mr Blair the embarrassing consequences.</p> <p>There are also to be considered the consequences for Northern Ireland, at a moment when Mr Blair is doing his best to keep the peace process alive, and when, as ever, the imminent prospect of a general election makes every calculation more awkward and more sensitive. This was a job that Mr Mandelson always coveted, and one to which he brought conspicuous dedication, seeming at first to bring a new stability too after the last uneasy days of Mo Mowlam. He regained some of the trust she had lost among the Unionists, though Sinn Fein and the SDLP found it a change for the worse. Yet the fate of the process was always less in Peter Mandelson's hands than those of Tony Blair. And at least two able candidates with experience at the Northern Ireland Office are available in the deputy, Adam Ingram, and his predecessor, Paul Murphy, now at the Wales Office.</p> <p>What happens to Peter Mandelson next is anyone's guess. His statement yesterday seemed to hint at a future both in and outside politics.

      "bodyText": "It was not his warm relationship with the Hinduja brothers which did for him; the Blairs themselves were scarcely less friendly. It was not his readiness to lift the phone and courteously check a detail or two with the Home Office on Srichand Hinduja's behalf. That was survivable. Nor was it some sleazy deal to speed Mr Hiduja's passport application on its way and take, in return, a large sum for funding the dome: all sides deny that any such deal was done, and no proof has been adduced for it. It was not even his addiction to the company of fashionable people and people loaded with money - an addiction which seemed to be under better control after the Geoffrey Robinson crisis, but which none the less persisted. No, what did for Peter Mandelson in the end was the defect which so many had identified in him over the years, and which Tony Blair, his friend and his shield and comforter in times of trouble, had so often been warned against by good friends of Labour's best interests - his apparently incurable deviousness. Mr Mandelson has left the government for the second time - and very likely, for good - because he did not come clean. When the Observer talked to him on Saturday before publishing its report about Srichand Hinduja's passport application, his version seemed straightforward enough: \"The matter was dealt with by my private secretary. At no time did I support or endorse this application for citizenship.\" But by Tuesday, the prime minister's press spokesman was having to alter that story. Now Mr Mandelson had after all been involved - though only to the extent of a two-minute call to his Home Office colleague, Mike O'Brien. That phone call, we were assured, had somehow slipped Mr Mandelson's mind. But on Tuesday night, a further version surfaced. Mr Mandelson denied having said he had forgotten the phone call: \"Nobody asked me about a phone call on Saturday, Sunday or Monday. Nobody asked me these questions.\" Alastair Campbell's undisguisedly angry Downing Street briefing signalled the end. Both he and his colleague Chris Smith had been badly misled and on the basis of wrong information had made false statements themselves. And fatally, by failing to come clean to Alastair Campbell, Mr Mandelson had done something unforgivable: he had failed to come clean with the prime minister. Especially after the Robinson crisis, he had every cause to know better. Twice in the past few weeks, first in the context of its embarrassment over donations to party funds, then in that of the MoD's shifty handling of the row over depleted uranium, we have recommended this precept for people in government: at times like this, do not try to wriggle your way out of trouble; come as clean as you can, as soon as you can. Had Mr Mandelson adopted that course right from the time the Observer phoned him, he would still have had a horrible week, but he might still have a worthwhile career in politics ahead of him now. Because this strand of deviousness links the two cases, what happened yesterday is bound to revive the question of whether Tony Blair was right to recall him to government a mere 10 months after his last expulsion. Ever since he won the leadership, Mr Blair has depended heavily - often too heavily - on Mr Mandelson's friendship and guidance. He has called him his rock and counsellor. He once joked that the New Labour project would not be complete until the party learned to love Peter. When Mr Mandelson had to resign over the Robinson loan, Mr Blair could not disguise his distress, and emphasised right from the start how much he looked forward to welcoming his errant minister back. To stand by a friend in trouble is a virtuous act in anyone, and not to be disparaged. But prime ministers need to be critical, for if they are not, they find themselves in the kind of predicament Mr Blair is mired in today. His dependence on Mr Mandelson had even threatened the party with an election campaign managed by two astute politicians who can barely stand the sight of each other - Mr Mandelson and the chancellor, Gordon Brown. That was never a sensible notion, and at least Mr Mandelson's going will spare Mr Blair the embarrassing consequences. There are also to be considered the consequences for Northern Ireland, at a moment when Mr Blair is doing his best to keep the peace process alive, and when, as ever, the imminent prospect of a general election makes every calculation more awkward and more sensitive. This was a job that Mr Mandelson always coveted, and one to which he brought conspicuous dedication, seeming at first to bring a new stability too after the last uneasy days of Mo Mowlam. He regained some of the trust she had lost among the Unionists, though Sinn Fein and the SDLP found it a change for the worse. Yet the fate of the process was always less in Peter Mandelson's hands than those of Tony Blair. And at least two able candidates with experience at the Northern Ireland Office are available in the deputy, Adam Ingram, and his predecessor, Paul Murphy, now at the Wales Office. What happens to Peter Mandelson next is anyone's guess. His statement yesterday seemed to hint at a future both in and outside politics. It would be no great surprise if, contemplating a record which no previous politician in memory has matched - two enforced resignations from the same cabinet in the course of a single parliament - he decided to cut his losses, give up his seat at Hartlepool, and seek his fortune elsewhere. That would be a conspicuous sacrifice in a man whose hopes for the highest political office were never really disguised. Indeed, had his ways of proceeding been as open and shining bright as his ambition, he might have survived far longer.

      "body": "<p>The architect Roderick Gradidge, who has died aged 71, spent most of his life in opposition to the trends of his profession. He enjoyed the romantic, the decorative and the excessive, and awakened many people to aesthetic pleasures denied by modernism.</p> <p>Gradidge seemed born to be a rebel. His father was a brigadier in the Corps of Guides, stationed on the north-west frontier of India, and, although he was born in Norfolk, his childhood was spent in India until he was sent to Stowe school in 1943. There, Gradidge was steered towards architecture. At the Architectural Association School in London, he denounced not only the rigours of modernism, but also the decorative style of the Festival of Britain. The principal, Robert Furneaux Jordan, declared that Gradidge could only have been an architect in pre-war England, but he got launched by building petrol stations in East Anglia and then working for Benskins breweries in Watford, sensitively converting pubs, for which he had a lifelong passion.</p> <p>From the early 1960s, Gradidge designed pub interiors of legendary elaboration, all long since destroyed. The Three Greyhounds in Soho was a neo-Tudor pub, in which he turned up the decorative volume. The Markham Arms in King's Road, Chelsea, was in the spirit of JM Whistler. By the mid-1960s, the Victorian revival was at its height, and Gradidge became an active member of the Victorian Society. He produced a scheme showing how the Midland Grand Hotel at St Pancras could be returned to hotel use when this was deemed a technical impossibility, contributing to the consensus for its preservation.</p> <p>His most original contribution to architectural interpretation was to lead the rehabilitation of Sir Edwin Lutyens, then dismissed as an anachronistic stylist. Gradidge demonstrated in an essay that Lutyens's three-dimensional geometry could be traced back to the \"vigorous\" Gothic of William Butterfield and George Edmund Street, who were \"approved\" by those inclined to modernism. In his view, the Arts and Crafts movement did not lead towards modernism, but to inter-war neo-Georgian and neo-Tudor. He wrote a monograph on Lutyens, published in 1981 to coincide with the Lutyens exhibition at the Hayward Gallery. Gradidge was also a founder committee member of the Thirties Society (after 1992, the Twentieth Century Society).</p> <p>He was a good writer on architecture, setting a cultural context, while analysing plan form and composition with an insight that few non-architect historians achieve. His book Dream Houses, The Edwardian Ideal, 1980, was a celebration of the Edwardian house, turning Robert Jordan's modernist condemnation of Lutyens as the designer of a dream into a post-modern term of praise. Gradidge developed this theme through an operetta, Grey Roses, with music by Huw Spratling, performed at the Art Workers Guild during the year of his mastership, 1987. The Surrey Style, 1991, was a manual on the Gradidge doctrine of how to alter and enlarge houses in the Lutyens heartland, showing his own sensitive, inventive and seamless operations on houses such as Lutyens's Fulbrook and Harold Falkner's Tancred's Ford.</p> <p>He also designed grand country house libraries for Easton Neston and Mount Stuart, and alterations to major Gothic Revival churches, such as Pugin's St Chad's, Birmingham, and St Augustine, Ramsgate. At Northampton Guildhall, the early Gothic masterpiece of EW Godwin, Gradidge reintroduced painted decoration. Working for the National Portrait Gallery, he transformed the interiors of Bodelwyddan Castle, Clwyd, and the entrance hall of the London gallery, where his revolving doors and decorative paint scheme were lately deemed too unmodern to survive. The major additions to St Edmund's College, Cambridge, 1990-93, show how he could spice up a dull building in fulfilment of a practical brief.</p> <p>Two institutions were the subject of Gradidge's particular loyalty: the church of St Mary, Bourne Street, where he recently completed a new columbarium, and the Art Workers Guild, which he joined in 1969. This he saw as a secret cell of anti-modern resistance, and he was planning a major Arts and Crafts exhibition during the last year.</p> <p>In the 1980s, the architectural world was inclining his way, and he ought to have had greater opportunities. He had a hybrid approach to things and people, as an intelligent anti-intellectual, a lover of low life and stickler for correctness, an eccentric dresser and tattoo enthusiast who could act like a peppery Colonel of Horse. The masquerade could become excessive, but a genuine human sympathy and boyish enthusiasm always shone through.</p> <p><b> Edward Greenfield writes:</b> To have a Georgian house redesigned around one by Roderick Gradidge was an exciting experience.

      "bodyText": "Turkey stepped up its economic and diplomatic reprisals against France yesterday as a wave of fury swept the country at the French national assembly's formal decision to recognise the killing of Armenians in eastern Turkey in 1915 as genocide swept the country. After street protests in Istanbul and Ankara, rightwing members of the coalition government warned that Turkey would consider imposing sanctions on any country that accused it of a deliberate policy of genocide. The health minister, Osman Durmus, said medical imports from France would be banned unless the French began to \"think more healthily\". Turkey scrapped a \u00a3176m spy satellite deal with the French firm Alacatel earlier this week and barred French companies from tendering for a \u00a34.76bn defence contract. It also recalled its ambassador from Paris. Several Turkish universities have threatened to close their French-language departments. The Turkish parliament will be asked to vote on a declaration accusing France of genocide during Algeria's 1955-62 war of independence. The prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, said at the weekend that officials were examining other measures. The results of our study on what kind of sanctions Turkey can impose on France, without causing itself any economic harm, will emerge in a few days,\" he said. On Thursday the French lower house of parliament unanimously adopted a declaration \"recognising the Armenian genocide of 1915\". The declaration, the result of prolonged lobbying by France's large Armenian community, did not mention Turkey by name, lacked any practical effect, and was opposed by both the prime minister, Lionel Jospin, and President Jacques Chirac. But its impact in Turkey was explosive. The Armenians say that 1.5m people died between 1915 and 1923, killed outright or in the epidemics and starvation that attended their forced deportations from eastern Turkey to Syria and Mesopotamia during the break-up of the Ottoman empire. Turkey is adamant that there was no genocide as such, that the figures are exaggerated, and that those who died were just some of the many victims of the geo-strategic turbulence of the first world war period, which included the Russian occupation of parts of Anatolia and many-sided partisan fighting. But the independent post-Soviet state of Armenia and the broadly dispersed Armenian diaspora - there are 1m people of Armenian descent in both the US and Russia, and sizeable communities in Canada, Georgia, Iran and Lebanon - put the blame squarely at Turkey's door. An official statement issued in the Armenian capital, Yerevan, welcomed the French declaration, saying that it \"strengthens historical justice\". Ankara is reported to have protested to Britain \"in the strongest terms\" about plans to commemorate the Armenian dead in ceremonies on Saturday marking Britain's first Holocaust memorial day. The row with France has potentially serious ramifications for Turkey's application to join the European Union, which is already beset by problems. Turkey is at the bottom of the queue of 13 aspiring EU members. The EU set out a route map for Turkish entry at its Nice summit last month and Mr Ecevit is due to respond soon. The main issue to be resolved is Turkey's much criticised human rights record. Ankara is regularly accused by human rights groups of torturing and maltreating detainees, particularly Kurds, leftwing radicals and militant Islamists. Its curbs on freedom of speech and publication are also at odds with EU standards, as is its retention of the death penalty. To cap it all, Turkey is embroiled in a separate row with France over the EU plan to create a European rapid reaction force. \u0095 Guardian Weekend will carry a special investigation into the Armenian massacres on Saturday.",

The surrender of the remaining two in a Holiday Inn in Colorado squared a popular culture circle. Their legend enhanced by media speculation, they were identified through a television show and wrapped up the chase by giving interviews to the presenter of a local news programme before being arrested. With murder, kidnapping, armed robbery, rape and child abuse on their records, the fugitives saw their flight spun into movie material. The gang, of which one committed suicide and four surrendered two days earlier, is accused of shooting dead a 29-year-old policeman while on the run. The denouement came when Patrick Murphy, 39, a rapist, and Donald Newbury, 38, a robber, said they would give up peacefully if they were allowed to speak to the local television station in Colorado Springs, 60 miles south of Denver. Each was given five minutes to speak by telephone to Eric Singer of KKTV, and they used the occasion to criticise Texan justice. \"Our judicial system in the state of Texas is gone to bits,\" Newbury said. \"We had a statement to make that the system is as corrupt as we are. I don't see how the system is working.

He talked about how they had blended into the community at the nearby Coachlight motel and trailer park, where they made their base, posing as Christians on their way from Texas to California. A neighbour on the site said they played religious music and one even went to a Bible class. \"It was really just by downplaying ourselves, changing our hair colour and such,\" Murphy said. \"We tried to remain as calm as possible at all times, but vigilant. We tried to be as friendly and as neighbourly as we could.\" The police were led to the motel by residents who recognised the men last weekend while watching a television programme called America's Most Wanted. The men broke out of a maximum security prison 60 miles south-east of San Antonio on December 13, raided an electrical goods shop in Houston, and then a sports shop in a Dallas suburb, where the policeman was shot 11 times. By then they were heavily armed and had about $70,000 (\u00a348,000). Each new \"sighting\" - there were more than 1,200 in the South and north to New York City and Canada - increased the belief that the hunt would end in a bloody showdown. The surviving six could be sentenced to death in Texas if they are convicted of murdering the policeman. Jayne Hawkins, the mother of the dead officer, said after the two surrendered: \"They're talking about rehabilitation. I suggest they go to work and not commit a crime and then come into a prison system and expect to be educated.\"",

The claim was made by a Chinese scientist in a case against the Japanese government brought by 180 relatives of those who were killed in experiments carried out by the imperial army's notorious Unit 731 during the second world war. Huang Ketai, a bacteriologist, said at least 109 people were killed in an outbreak of plague in Ningbo, south of Shanghai, in November and December 1940. Just a few days before the onset of the disease, several people saw Japanese planes drop fleas and grain over houses in the city, leading him to conclude that the population was being used as a guinea pig for a deadly pathogen. \"It is very clear that the outbreak was caused deliberately,\" he said in response to questions from the three judges hear the case, which is nearing the end after more than four years. \"The timing and geographical spread of the disease all point to the conclusion that its origin was the cargo dumped by the planes.\" Ningbo was no stranger to the plague, which at the time struck north-east China every few years. But Dr Huang, the first scientist to give evidence in the case, said there were several differences in the 1940 outbreak: it came in winter rather than summer, killed humans but few rats, and was carried by a flea that was not native to the region. It was also unusual in the the rapid rate at which the outbreak spread, the number of lives it claimed and its short duration. \"This was a particularly virulent form of the plague that could only have been created artificially by Unit 731,\" he told the court. According to the plaintiffs' case, Unit 731 killed at least 2,100 - mostly Chinese - people in an attempt to develop a biological weapon that could win the war for Japan. Witnesses have said that the effects of the unit's germ warfare experiments are still being felt in China, because the germ bombs released pathogens which continue to return. As well as the psychological fear of a fresh outbreak of disease, people in north-east China have to bear the cost of razing properties suspected of being infected. For years after the war, the activities of Unit 731 remained veiled in secrecy. According to academics, its actions were barely covered in the proceedings of the Tokyo war crimes tribunal because the United States wanted to use the results on live subjects. Recently, after a series of confessions by veterans, the Japanese government acknowledged the unit's existence. But it still refuses to reveal the scope of the scientists' activities.

      "bodyText": "There is one revelation from Richard Tomlinson (What's in that book, January 24) which should cause concern: the fact that MI6 forged a National Union of Journalists membership card as part of Tomlinson's cover in the Balkans is disturbing. Many journalists have been killed around the world in the past few years, a number because they were suspected of either being part of the state machinery or \"agents of influence\" of hostile intelligence agencies. Is it not time that the recruitment of journalists and the use of journalist cover by the security services was outlawed? It would be a step forward if journalists themselves acknowledged that acting as agents for MI6 is unethical. The recent obituaries of Observer journalist Gavin Young illustrates how widespread is the practice. Stephen Dorril Holmfirth, West Yorkshire \u0095 Exactly how many more times do we have to read Richard Tomlinson's escapade in Portsmouth to obtain passport numbers from two nurses for MI6? Thankfully it was only twice yesterday (Comment, and Francis Wheen in G2). Ian Traynor's article yesterday struggled to fill half of page 3 with only a few more newsworthy incidents. Francis Wheen says MI6 recruits \"deadballs and oddballs and outright fantasists\", and I am adamant I fall into one of those categories (as do many of my friends). However I sincerely doubt whether much recruitment takes place at Newcastle University, my current abode. Or perhaps I'm a spy. I'm afraid I must conceal my email address. My name has been changed (numerous times). Jake Lee Newcastle-upon-Tyne",

      "bodyText": "Yvonne Roberts's ramble (Jobs for the lads, January 19) contains so many errors of fact that it would probably take up the whole Letters page to respond in detail. She says of the lord chancellor's appointment of his special adviser that he is a \"law breaker\". This is untrue. The employment appeal tribunal, applying the relevant legislation, has found quite clearly that there was no discrimination, direct or indirect, in relation to the appointment of Garry Hart. Ms Roberts has also misunderstood the criminal defence service, which comes into being on April 2. The purpose of reform is to ensure that legally-aided services provided by private practitioners (solicitors and barristers) are quality-assured for their clients' benefit, and provide good value for money for the taxpayer. There will also be a tiny number of salaried defenders: the legal services commission plans to open six offices on a pilot basis. Hardly a threat to the 3,000 odd solicitors' firms who will have a criminal contract. The lord chancellor has repeatedly made clear that the legal professions will continue to consist predominantly of private practitioners. There is simply no evidence for Ms Roberts's casual assertion that salaried defenders will not be independent. They will be every bit as professionally independent as those in private practice.

The killing and the exodus of many other Armenians was an early 20th century version of what we now call ethnic cleansing.

For several centuries the Armenians lived peacefully in the Ottoman empire, but towards the end of the 19th century the rise of competing Turkish and Armenian nationalism, as the power of the Ottoman sultans went into terminal decline, began to create serious unrest. During the first world war the the Ottoman Turks, who were allied with Germany, saw the Armenian minority siding with the Russians against them, and came to look on them as the enemy within.

      "body": "<p>Oh Peter, how could you? You want the world to believe that you are a media victim and your epitaph to read: \"Peter Mandelson. Unrecognised Genius. Hounded from office by the press. Twice.\"</p> <p>Good try, but it just doesn't wash, I'm afraid. You have certainly suffered from some pretty beastly journalism at times. I know of several occasions when allegations in newspapers have been well wide of the mark.</p> <p>When I approached you at the Guardian's last summer party to sympathise about one obvious case you told me that there had been so many inaccurate stories, so much spite, such persistent innuendo, you had virtually given up issuing denials.</p> <p>Employing that odd mixture of world weariness and curtness that has become your trademark - the sigh, the swift turning of the back and a clipped phrase delivered over the shoulder as you aim for the door - you damned the whole lot of us.</p> <p>Odd, I thought, for here you were at a newspaper party, and funnily enough, the last time I saw you was at a soiree for the Independent. You obviously love mixing with the enemy.</p> <p>That's the point, though, isn't it? Almost all that we know of your talents as the Labour party's greatest political campaign strategist, as a fixer and a mixer, as the foremost eminence guise of modern times, have come from the media.</p> <p>While spinning for Neil Kinnock and then for Tony Blair, you have never shied away from spinning for Peter Mandelson. You have made it clear to journalists that you have been the man in the know, the key player.</p> <p>Your currency has been inside information: the dropped word to this correspondent, the unattributable tip to that one, the nod and wink to yet another. But the coinage has long since been debased, not because what you have said has not been true, but because of its intent.</p> <p>Journalists, and their editors, have long rankled at the obvious attempt at manipulation.</p> <p>That might have been okay, too, but once the spinner turns on the people he spins, it's no wonder that papers grew both wary and weary of your activities (and there might well be a lesson there for our old chum, Alastair Campbell, too).</p> <p>In other words, you have chosen to play that most dangerous of games - poacher and gatekeeper - using the press in private while attacking it in public. That's why, during your home loan fiasco, the press attacked you so forcibly. Did you not understand? It wasn't political, it was personal.</p> <p>Truly, the press was doing its proper job. Exposing your secret financial deal with another minister, and all the circumstances surrounding it, was in the public interest. But there was undoubtedly an edge to the headlines, the cartoons and the commentary. This wasn't just another minister in trouble.</p> <p>It was Mandelson.</p> <p>Journalists leapt at your throat with a glee I have rarely witnessed. Indeed, after researching the last 55 years of British newspapers, in which there have been all manner of political witch-hunts and smears, I am fairly sure you took the biggest and most sustained hammering any politician - aside from a prime minister or party leader - has endured. You were getting your come-uppance from the people you sought so long, but so crudely, to influence.</p> <p>You said at the time of that resignation that you felt humbled and, for a while, I believed you. You seemed to have realised that you had made a terrible error and, in the unlikely event of a come-back, everything would be different.</p> <p>By the way, in case this thought crosses your mind, I don't think you should attribute press hostility to homophobia. The way you were outed on Newsnight was unfortunate and, after an initial, and possibly understandable bout of hysteria from you, you did handle it well.</p> <p>There may be individual journalists who are anti-gay, but don't fool yourself into thinking that's why you have been getting the rough treatment all over again.</p> <p>Though I was surprised at your return to the cabinet, I expected that you would be a different man. You would now be squeaky clean. You would know, after the last round, that you had few friends in the press. Indeed, implicit in what you said to me that summer evening, was a recognition that newspapers were your implacable enemy. So why Peter, why did you not stop and think before making that call on behalf of Srichand Hinduja?</p> <p>I can only attribute it to your arrogance. Having returned to high office, you felt invulnerable all over again. You were entertaining Northern Ireland's finest in Hillsborough castle at weekends. You were back inside the beltway, briefing correspondents about many more subjects than Ulster's faltering peace process. You could, you probably thought, do anything.</p> <p>But your enemies are not confined to the press, as you also know. Some time, that call - however innocently you wish to portray it - was bound to come to light.</p> <p>It may well have come sooner had Mr Hinduja and his brothers made a successful bid for Express Newspapers. Journalists from competing papers would have expended hours of otherwise good drinking time trying to discover why Mr Hinduja got his British passport so soon after giving \u00a31m to the dome's faith zone.</p> <p>The revelation has taken longer to emerge than I expected when I first questioned the oddity of that arrangement last October.</p> <p>Mention of the dome reminds me about the way in which you acted as lightning rod for the early press criticism of that project.

      "bodyText": "Oh Peter, how could you? You want the world to believe that you are a media victim and your epitaph to read: \"Peter Mandelson. Unrecognised Genius. Hounded from office by the press. Twice.\" Good try, but it just doesn't wash, I'm afraid. You have certainly suffered from some pretty beastly journalism at times. I know of several occasions when allegations in newspapers have been well wide of the mark. When I approached you at the Guardian's last summer party to sympathise about one obvious case you told me that there had been so many inaccurate stories, so much spite, such persistent innuendo, you had virtually given up issuing denials. Employing that odd mixture of world weariness and curtness that has become your trademark - the sigh, the swift turning of the back and a clipped phrase delivered over the shoulder as you aim for the door - you damned the whole lot of us. Odd, I thought, for here you were at a newspaper party, and funnily enough, the last time I saw you was at a soiree for the Independent. You obviously love mixing with the enemy. That's the point, though, isn't it? Almost all that we know of your talents as the Labour party's greatest political campaign strategist, as a fixer and a mixer, as the foremost eminence guise of modern times, have come from the media. While spinning for Neil Kinnock and then for Tony Blair, you have never shied away from spinning for Peter Mandelson. You have made it clear to journalists that you have been the man in the know, the key player. Your currency has been inside information: the dropped word to this correspondent, the unattributable tip to that one, the nod and wink to yet another. But the coinage has long since been debased, not because what you have said has not been true, but because of its intent. Journalists, and their editors, have long rankled at the obvious attempt at manipulation. That might have been okay, too, but once the spinner turns on the people he spins, it's no wonder that papers grew both wary and weary of your activities (and there might well be a lesson there for our old chum, Alastair Campbell, too). In other words, you have chosen to play that most dangerous of games - poacher and gatekeeper - using the press in private while attacking it in public. That's why, during your home loan fiasco, the press attacked you so forcibly. Did you not understand? It wasn't political, it was personal. Truly, the press was doing its proper job. Exposing your secret financial deal with another minister, and all the circumstances surrounding it, was in the public interest. But there was undoubtedly an edge to the headlines, the cartoons and the commentary. This wasn't just another minister in trouble. It was Mandelson. Journalists leapt at your throat with a glee I have rarely witnessed. Indeed, after researching the last 55 years of British newspapers, in which there have been all manner of political witch-hunts and smears, I am fairly sure you took the biggest and most sustained hammering any politician - aside from a prime minister or party leader - has endured. You were getting your come-uppance from the people you sought so long, but so crudely, to influence. You said at the time of that resignation that you felt humbled and, for a while, I believed you. You seemed to have realised that you had made a terrible error and, in the unlikely event of a come-back, everything would be different. By the way, in case this thought crosses your mind, I don't think you should attribute press hostility to homophobia. The way you were outed on Newsnight was unfortunate and, after an initial, and possibly understandable bout of hysteria from you, you did handle it well. There may be individual journalists who are anti-gay, but don't fool yourself into thinking that's why you have been getting the rough treatment all over again. Though I was surprised at your return to the cabinet, I expected that you would be a different man. You would now be squeaky clean. You would know, after the last round, that you had few friends in the press. Indeed, implicit in what you said to me that summer evening, was a recognition that newspapers were your implacable enemy. So why Peter, why did you not stop and think before making that call on behalf of Srichand Hinduja? I can only attribute it to your arrogance. Having returned to high office, you felt invulnerable all over again. You were entertaining Northern Ireland's finest in Hillsborough castle at weekends. You were back inside the beltway, briefing correspondents about many more subjects than Ulster's faltering peace process. You could, you probably thought, do anything. But your enemies are not confined to the press, as you also know. Some time, that call - however innocently you wish to portray it - was bound to come to light. It may well have come sooner had Mr Hinduja and his brothers made a successful bid for Express Newspapers. Journalists from competing papers would have expended hours of otherwise good drinking time trying to discover why Mr Hinduja got his British passport so soon after giving \u00a31m to the dome's faith zone. The revelation has taken longer to emerge than I expected when I first questioned the oddity of that arrangement last October. Mention of the dome reminds me about the way in which you acted as lightning rod for the early press criticism of that project. It may have been unfair, but did it not give you pause for thought? Did it not suggest that you should step carefully in future? Peter, you cannot really blame the press for your downfall. You brought all this on yourself. You set out to make newspapers dance to your tune, but they didn't like your music or your lyrics. Now, at the moment of your defeat, the papers are on song again. \u0095 Roy Greenslade is a former editor of the Daily Mirror Full text The resignation speech Special reports New Labour in power Northern Ireland Photo gallery Mandelson: a career in pictures Audio Peter Mandelson announces his resignation (3mins 30) Michael White at Westminster (2mins 14) Martin Wainwright in Hartlepool (3mins 55) Related articles 24.01.2001: Mandelson resigns 24.01.2001: Blair backs 'courageous' Mandelson 24.01.2001: Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: the Mandelson I knew 24.01.2001: Analysis by Nicholas Watt - Farewell Mandelson, brilliant but unloved 24.01.2001: Fish and sympathy from Mandelson's Hartlepool constituency 24.01.2001: Analysis: Resignation upsets pot as Irish stew 24.01.2001: The hands-on Hindujas Profile: Srichand Hinduja 24.01.2001: Passport row lands Mandelson in trouble Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour Mandelson resigns over his home loan Rivals in the Labour party How Mandy replaced Mo Cartoon Steve Bell on Peter Mandelson Talk about it Have your say: should Mandelson have quit?

      "body": "<p>From the start this New Labour government has been permeated by contrasting cultures. Ideological division is close to zero. Left and right factions that were accorded formal status by every former Labour prime minister no longer exist, though Blairites v Brownies is a battle sometimes made to stand proxy for them. There is really no such contest. But there has always been a contrast of tone, of style, of milieu, of social aspiration, between what one might call flash politics and drudge politics. Peter Mandelson's resignation heralds, not to Labour's disadvantage, a decisive victory for the drudgery style.</p> <p>One can imagine the scene in Downing Street yesterday morning. Tony Blair had undeviating faith in Mr Mandelson's judgment and fraternity. The parting of the ways was necessary, because once too often, and close to an election, Mandelson skated beyond the edge of the truth. The sundering would be terrible, because the prime minister has a personal instinct for loyalty, as well as a political desire to offer no scalp to the other side. He showed this in the House with decent, eloquent and repeated recognition of what the now-defunct minister did for Ireland. The end had a pain reaching beyond the normal purlieus of political cynicism.</p> <p>But the departure also marked a cultural shift. Peter Mandelson, though he has other qualities, personifies the flash side of New Labour. He occupied the junction where the new rich met showbusiness, and aspiring socialites made their bids to climb aboard the new establishment. New Labour needed to be friends with royalty. Peter was their friend. It needed business acceptance. Peter was one of the guarantors. It proved the non-existence of the class war by turning up at all the right parties. Nobody better than Peter demonstrated that Labour had no enemies on the boogying, socialising, upwardly mobile right.</p> <p>This may have been a necessary part of Labour's transformation into a party for all types of people. Its disadvantage was that it distracted attention from so much else. What often got lost - is still largely unnoticed - in the Mandelsonian images that tend to define the Blair government is how large a proportion of its ministers are, in a drudge-like way, competent.</p> <p>Jack Straw is not one of my favourites, and has single-handedly cut the party off from its liberal constituency. But he is an able minister. He has handled the political minefield of the Home Office with sure feet. David Blunkett is another capable drudge: industrious, creative, committed. Geoff Hoon, Alan Milburn and Alistair Darling fall into the same category. They are unglamorous, and none of them looks like a potential leader. But they get diligently on with the job. They are not sleazy. There are no signs of exhaustion. The opposition can't lay a glove on any of them. This government includes no Hogg or Redwood or Mawhinney, to name but three disasters from the last one.</p> <p>But the drudges tend to be overshadowed. The public profile of the government barely includes them. They're the victims of the presidentialism that puts Tony Blair at the top and the rest nowhere, around which much of the flashiness and all Labour's image-building rotated. That was a style of politics that Mandelson was most influential in inventing when Labour was in opposition. And Mr Blair, of course, is complicit in the fact that he personally has become the only name and face with which most of the public associate his party.</p> <p>Yet such a concentration has bad effects. The predominant image of the government - its divisions, its bitcheries, its rivalries, not to mention its apparent obsession with appearance over content - comes from a relentless focus on the lives and work of four men, Blair, Brown, Mandelson and Alastair Campbell, with a few acolytes and hangers-on thrown in. Here's where the glamour and excitement are. Much of the other work is almost wholly obscured. In terms of plodding competence, this is beginning to show itself as one of the best governments of the last half-century. Yet the flash-dancing gets just about all the attention.</p> <p>Mandelson's withdrawal will help to change that. As he said, the scrutiny of his every move became intolerable, especially when one move turned out to be wrong. His absence won't, on the other hand, make cabinet reshuffling any easier after the election. Yesterday's emergency surgery doesn't diminish Mr Blair's problem which is, unusually, a surfeit rather than a scarcity of talent.</p> <p>It was never likely that Mandelson would become foreign secretary any time soon. This was less because of his defects than the incumbent's burgeoning talents, after early turmoil in his private life, as a brilliant drudge. Robin Cook will almost certainly succeed Robin Cook. He's regularly singled out for praise in private conversation. His command of detail and negotiating skills, as well as the respect he enjoys abroad, are much valued by the prime minister. Replacing him with Jack Straw, his plausible rival, would be a Eurosceptic signal the leader won't want to give. So that's one non-vacancy.</p> <p>The Treasury is also unlikely to change hands. Some see Gordon Brown's shift to the FCO as the way to finesse his anti-euro sway at the Treasury, as well as proving Blair's domination. It doesn't make sense. Brown would loathe and fight it. Besides, unlike a succession of Tory chancellors, this Labour one has no serious economic argument with his leader. However, the shuffling field is thereby further narrowed. Plainly there will be some forced departures. The names of Smith, Brown (N), Beckett and, now, Byers, appear in the frame. The main problem, however, is strength not weakness. For down below too, there are able people whose names you have barely heard of behind the incessant static generated by the prime minister's domination: Clarke, Denham, Hewitt, several others.</p> <p>I regret seeing Peter Mandelson go. He has the breadth and many of the skills our public life always needs. He probably thought he was doing his national duty, giving a minor leg-up to someone who was going to help rescue Blairism's biggest calamity down in Greenwich. He plainly has incautious judgment when it comes to his own affairs and contacts. But he's right about Europe, being one of the few ministers to give that keynote subject the priority it deserves. He also showed a lot of political guts in trying to progress the peace process.</p> <p>On the other hand, a distraction has departed. Having helped refashion Labour into an electable party of the centre, he leaves the field to people who are more old Labour in style if not content: decent, earnest, often incredibly dull, but, I guess, the kind of types with whom voters feel more comfortable. Mr Blair himself has been moving that way for some time, stressing competence and continuity rather than the exuberant flash of 1997. It's through his own folly that Mandelson went. But his going says a certain style of politics has, quite regrettably, had its day.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:&quot;hugoyoung@compuserve.com&quot;\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p> <p><b>Full text</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">The resignation speech</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">New Labour in power</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/nireland/\">Northern Ireland</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Mandelson: a career in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">Peter Mandelson announces his resignation (3mins 30)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124white.ra\">Michael White at Westminster (2mins 14)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/  news/politics/0124wainwright.ra\">Martin Wainwright in Hartlepool (3mins 55)</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427479,00.html\">24.01.2001: Mandelson resigns</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427569,00.html\">24.01.2001: Blair backs 'courageous' Mandelson </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427562,00.html\">24.01.2001: Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: the Mandelson I knew</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427481,00.html\">24.01.2001: Analysis by Nicholas Watt - Farewell Mandelson, brilliant but unloved</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427491,00.html\">24.01.2001: Fish and sympathy from Mandelson's Hartlepool constituency</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427558,00.html\">24.01.2001: Analysis: Resignation upsets pot as Irish stew </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427475,00.html\">24.01.2001: The hands-on Hindujas</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,427264,00.html\">Profile: Srichand Hinduja</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427465,00.html\">24.01.2001: Passport row lands Mandelson in trouble</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,427417,00.html\">Steve Bell on Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e6ee\">Have your say: should Mandelson have quit?</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number-10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageID=3291\" target=\"_new\">Press briefing</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nio.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Northern Ireland Office</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a><br><a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Belfast Telegraph</a></p>",

This government includes no Hogg or Redwood or Mawhinney, to name but three disasters from the last one. But the drudges tend to be overshadowed. The public profile of the government barely includes them. They're the victims of the presidentialism that puts Tony Blair at the top and the rest nowhere, around which much of the flashiness and all Labour's image-building rotated. That was a style of politics that Mandelson was most influential in inventing when Labour was in opposition. And Mr Blair, of course, is complicit in the fact that he personally has become the only name and face with which most of the public associate his party. Yet such a concentration has bad effects. The predominant image of the government - its divisions, its bitcheries, its rivalries, not to mention its apparent obsession with appearance over content - comes from a relentless focus on the lives and work of four men, Blair, Brown, Mandelson and Alastair Campbell, with a few acolytes and hangers-on thrown in. Here's where the glamour and excitement are. Much of the other work is almost wholly obscured. In terms of plodding competence, this is beginning to show itself as one of the best governments of the last half-century. Yet the flash-dancing gets just about all the attention. Mandelson's withdrawal will help to change that. As he said, the scrutiny of his every move became intolerable, especially when one move turned out to be wrong. His absence won't, on the other hand, make cabinet reshuffling any easier after the election. Yesterday's emergency surgery doesn't diminish Mr Blair's problem which is, unusually, a surfeit rather than a scarcity of talent. It was never likely that Mandelson would become foreign secretary any time soon. This was less because of his defects than the incumbent's burgeoning talents, after early turmoil in his private life, as a brilliant drudge. Robin Cook will almost certainly succeed Robin Cook. He's regularly singled out for praise in private conversation. His command of detail and negotiating skills, as well as the respect he enjoys abroad, are much valued by the prime minister. Replacing him with Jack Straw, his plausible rival, would be a Eurosceptic signal the leader won't want to give. So that's one non-vacancy. The Treasury is also unlikely to change hands. Some see Gordon Brown's shift to the FCO as the way to finesse his anti-euro sway at the Treasury, as well as proving Blair's domination. It doesn't make sense. Brown would loathe and fight it. Besides, unlike a succession of Tory chancellors, this Labour one has no serious economic argument with his leader. However, the shuffling field is thereby further narrowed. Plainly there will be some forced departures. The names of Smith, Brown (N), Beckett and, now, Byers, appear in the frame. The main problem, however, is strength not weakness. For down below too, there are able people whose names you have barely heard of behind the incessant static generated by the prime minister's domination: Clarke, Denham, Hewitt, several others. I regret seeing Peter Mandelson go. He has the breadth and many of the skills our public life always needs. He probably thought he was doing his national duty, giving a minor leg-up to someone who was going to help rescue Blairism's biggest calamity down in Greenwich. He plainly has incautious judgment when it comes to his own affairs and contacts. But he's right about Europe, being one of the few ministers to give that keynote subject the priority it deserves. He also showed a lot of political guts in trying to progress the peace process. On the other hand, a distraction has departed. Having helped refashion Labour into an electable party of the centre, he leaves the field to people who are more old Labour in style if not content: decent, earnest, often incredibly dull, but, I guess, the kind of types with whom voters feel more comfortable. Mr Blair himself has been moving that way for some time, stressing competence and continuity rather than the exuberant flash of 1997. It's through his own folly that Mandelson went. But his going says a certain style of politics has, quite regrettably, had its day. hugoyoung@compuserve.com Full text The resignation speech Special reports New Labour in power Northern Ireland Photo gallery Mandelson: a career in pictures Audio Peter Mandelson announces his resignation (3mins 30) Michael White at Westminster (2mins 14) Martin Wainwright in Hartlepool (3mins 55) Related articles 24.01.2001: Mandelson resigns 24.01.2001: Blair backs 'courageous' Mandelson 24.01.2001: Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: the Mandelson I knew 24.01.2001: Analysis by Nicholas Watt - Farewell Mandelson, brilliant but unloved 24.01.2001: Fish and sympathy from Mandelson's Hartlepool constituency 24.01.2001: Analysis: Resignation upsets pot as Irish stew 24.01.2001: The hands-on Hindujas Profile: Srichand Hinduja 24.01.2001: Passport row lands Mandelson in trouble Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour Mandelson resigns over his home loan Rivals in the Labour party How Mandy replaced Mo Cartoon Steve Bell on Peter Mandelson Talk about it Have your say: should Mandelson have quit?

To this end a partnership deal has been set up that will see money ploughed back into the game for every new customer who joins Npower. In announcing the sponsorship the chief executive of the ECB Tim Lamb added that as a further encouragement, under-16s will be admitted free to the last scheduled day of Tests and will pay half price otherwise. \"We look forward to developing an excellent relationship with Npower in our efforts to broaden the game's appeal to a new generation of cricket-watchers,\" he said. \"Npower is a modern thriving company with a very forward-looking and consumer-focused attitude to its business, and these are attributes with which cricket wants to be associated.\"",

But choosing his words to avoid embarrassing the Labour government in the run-up to the general election, he stressed that greater integration among the countries of Europe did not mean the end of the nation state. And he avoided saying federalism, referring to it as the \"German f-word\". Mr Fischer, who emerged in a Berlin speech last year as the leading proponent of a more powerful and more democratic European Union, struck out in his London address at all the bulwarks of British Euroscepticism: Conservative MPs, Lady Thatcher, and the press. In one of the most pro-European speeches made on British soil by a foreign leader, he set out what he referred to as \"mega-projects\" for the EU. This would create a union with wider powers, a more straightforward system of making decisions, and greater democratic accountablity. He described Europe's single currency, which Britain has not joined, as a success, claiming that the euro was more stable than even the deutschmark had been in the 1990s. The Foreign Office, which saw an advance copy of the speech, had warned Mr Fischer to be careful what he said, so as not to be misinterpreted by Eurosceptic media. Mr Fischer, who joked in the speech about being labelled by Eurosceptics \"the most dangerous man in Europe\", partly heeded the advice. \"The EU is never going to be a state, let alone some kind of superstate,\" he said. \"No one - in Germany, France or anywhere else in Europe - wants a centralised superbureaucracy.\" He also tried to allay fears that US-European relations could be weakened. The Conservative MP John Redwood, who was in the audience, said that in spite of a few cosmetic changes, the speech showed that the German minister had not repented and was saying things the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, believed but was embarrassed to say. Mr Fischer said the sceptics had misread what was happening in Europe. \"The nightmare of British Eurosceptics, the so-called superstate, a new sovereign that would abolish the old nation states along with their democratic governments - is therefore nothing but a synthetic construct that has nothing whatsoever to do with European reality.\" In a piece of mischief, he said he agreed with the sceptics' heroine, Margaret Thatcher, who said in 1975 there was a need to pool sovereignty to create more effective political bodies.

      "bodyText": "Two clear winners have emerged from an affair that will shift the balance of power at the very top of the government. Gordon Brown's position is strengthened further, his arch enemy's departure tightening his grip on power and removing an obstacle to him running for, and quite possibly winning, the Labour leadership if Tony Blair steps down after the election. Mr Mandelson was an opposing force within cabinet and more widely in the media, briefing against Mr Brown in a feud that stretched back to 1994, when \"Bobby\" backed Mr Blair for the party's crown. The chancellor benefits, too, from the hit Mr Blair will inevitably take from the fall of one of his closest political allies and the inevitable questions about his judgment in bringing back Mr Mandelson nine months after he had to go. Tellingly, Mr Brown yesterday asked his aides and supporters to say absolutely nothing, to avoid accusations he had \"won\" the seven-year feud with the Hartlepool MP. The second clear winner is Alastair Campbell, victorious in what, despite Downing Street denials, looked like a \"me or him\" showdown after Mr Mandelson's casualness with the truth required the prime minister's official spokesman to apologise for misleading the media. Relations had been strained between the two masters of spin since Mr Mandelson returned as Northern Ireland secretary in September 1999, and the resignation will reinforce the influence of a press secretary dubbed the real deputy prime minister. Other winners include Robin Cook, virtually stalked by Mr Mandelson, who coveted his job as foreign secretary, and the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, who is close to Gordon Brown and who Mr Mandelson wanted sacked after the election. On top of the reshuffle triggered yesterday, Mr Mandelson was due to be brought back from Belfast after the election and the line-up of the cabinet will be considerably different without him at Mr Blair's right elbow. The Paisley South MP, Douglas Alexander, a protege of the chancellor's who was given a Millbank role in November 1999, will also benefit by plotting Labour's election campaign as Mr Mandelson, made joint co-ordinator with the chancellor, takes a back seat. The option of an April election has probably been closed off by the events of the past few days, yet whether the Mandelson row will help the Tories in May is difficult to gauge, though it cannot have done William Hague any harm. The biggest loser after Mr Mandelson is Mr Blair. He brought his ally back less than a year after the first resignation in the teeth of warnings that he could prove a disruptive influence. The prime minister yesterday found himself under fire on two contradictory fronts. One prominent Labour backbencher said it had exposed his reliance on \"Tony's cronies\" - appointing friends to key posts and overlooking their failings in return for their loyalty. A close acquaintance of Mr Mandelson took a contrary view, claiming the prime minister's presentation to the Tories of such a prized scalp betrayed the prime minister's unwillingness to stand by his friends. \"He's got the job he wants so he's not bothered about what jobs other people have,\" is the harsh view of one member of the Millbank tendency. Whatever the truth, saying goodbye to Mr Mandelson so soon after welcoming him back into the cabinet casts a shadow over the prime minister's judgment in the eyes of both camps. A number of policy wonks in Downing Street, and thinktanks and pressure groups who owe their positions largely to the patronage of the great manipulator may also be sleeping less soundly in their beds. Mr Mandelson's departure is a major blow for \"the project\", the Blairite drive to take the Labour party away from its trade union roots and get closer to the Liberal Democrats, introducing proportional representation in an attempt to guarantee government from the centre. The diaries of the former Liberal Democrat leader, Paddy Ashdown, detail Mr Mandelson's desire to push forward co-operation between the two parties, attending crucial meetings and helping to set up the joint cabinet committee. With Mr Mandelson gone, Mr Blair has few supporters at the heart of government to push ahead with the plan and his opponents, particularly over electoral reform, may be emboldened by the fall. Mr Mandelson was also one of the government's most enthusiastic supporters of the euro, initially arguing that Britain should have held a referendum on joining the single currency shortly after the last election, before pressing for the plebiscite to be held soon after the next. With Mr Cook and the trade secretary, Stephen Byers, he championed the benefits of campaigning to sell the euro to the public against the cautious approach of the chancellor. Out of government and freed of the constraints of collective responsibility, Mr Mandelson may be more vocal in his support for the euro. But Mr Cook and Mr Byers are more isolated in the cabinet as a duo rather than part of a trio that included a minister with the prime minister's ear, so Mr Mandelson's exit in all likelihood will strengthen the hand of the chancellor.

      "body": "<p>Peter Mandelson's glittering political career collapsed yesterday for the second and final time over an unnecessary act of deception - his fatal refusal to be frank with the prime minster about his role in brokering a British passport for a \u00a31m donor to the Millennium Dome.</p> <p>In a day of high drama not equalled at Westminster since Mr Mandelson's previous resignation, over his secret home loan in 1998, the man who helped to craft New Labour's modernising image for 15 years stepped down as the Northern Ireland secretary and renounced all strategic responsibility for the coming general election.</p> <p>Waking up to a barrage of hostile headlines yesterday, both Tony Blair and Mr Mandelson almost certainly knew it was all over by the time they met at number 10 in mid-morning. Three hours later came an apologetic resignation statement in the street outside.</p> <p>Before the meeting the prime minister's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, had refused to endorse the Northern Ireland secretary when he briefed reporters. \"The prime minister has got to face the House of Commons this afternoon and there are a number of areas of fact he feels the need to pin down.\"</p> <p>In their hour-long meeting Mr Blair and his most trusted aide discussed why the media, Mr Campbell and ministers were misled for 48 hours about Mr Mandelson's single phone call to Mike O'Brien, the immigration minister, in June 1998.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson insisted he had done nothing improper, but accepted that he had not told the whole truth about his intervention in the application for naturalisation by Srichanda Hinduja, a wealthy Indian businessman.</p> <p>After revelations in the Observer on Sunday, Mr Mandelson had insisted that he had merely asked his private office to pass on a request for information regarding a possible application from Mr Hinduja to the Home Office in June 1998. In fact he made the crucial two-minute phone call in person.</p> <p>In the same month the Hinduja brothers offered to sponsor the faith zone at the Millennium Dome. Mr Mandelson, as the cabinet office minister, was in charge of the Greenwich project.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson, who was out of office for 10 months after the Guardian's revelations about his \u00a3373,000 home loan from Geoffrey Robinson, is now entitled to his second ministerial pay-off, of \u00a312,129, in just over two years.</p> <p>Yesterday insiders emphatically denied that Mr Campbell had threatened to resign if Mr Mandelson did not. There was no need to do so, MPs agreed. The minister's inconsistencies, in private and on also television on Tuesday night, were all too evident.</p> <p>\"If Tony ever had to choose between Peter and Alastair, Alastair would win. He is the long distance runner, Peter the sprinter,\" one Labour veteran explained.</p> <p>Mr Campbell later confirmed that Mr Mandelson would not be taking part in Labour's general election campaign. \"I think Peter's making clear from his statement that he is clearly looking to wind down his political activity,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson's exit leaves the chancellor, Gordon Brown, in a much stronger position. He and his close ally, Douglas Alexander, will now be in complete charge at Millbank, the party's headquarters. Mr Mandelson had been responsible for the nuts and bolts planning for the election.</p> <p>Last night there was even doubt about whether Mr Mandelson would stay on as an MP. Tim Allan, a former Downing Street press officer and friend of Mr Mandelson, said the member for Hartlepool would think \"long and hard\" before dropping his constituency, and insisted that he would want to remain in public life.</p> <p>In his statement Mr Mandelson denied \"acting improperly\" over Mr Hinduja's passport bid, but admitted: \"I do accept that when my office spoke to a Sunday newspaper at the weekend I should have been clear that it was me personally, not my officials, who spoke to a Home Office minister.\"</p> <p>He also attacked the media for its relentless vilification of his political role as a pro- European, pro-Lib-Lab moderate, and for its interest in his private life. \"I want to remove myself from the countless stories of controversy, feuds and division and all the rest. I want in other words to lead a more normal life, both in politics and, in the future, outside,\" he said.</p> <p>In the Commons, William Hague gleefully denounced the prime minister's \"monumental error of judgment\" in giving his old friend a second chance in 1999 - leaving Mr Blair loyally to defend the achievements of the flawed colleague who sat grim-faced at his side.</p> <p>But few Tories believe their own election chances have been much improved. \"William has 24 hours to make this stick to Blair,\" said one MP. The Tory leader did so by claiming that Mr Mandelson had been \"central to everything you have done\" - from spin to smears on colleagues. The Liberal leader, Charles Kennedy, joined Mr Blair in saying it was Mr Hague who had demeaned himself.</p> <p>Downing Street last night moved to replace Mr Mandelson at what is seen as a crucial stage in the Northern Ireland peace process, giving the job to the Scottish secretary, John Reid. He is replaced, in turn, by Helen Liddell.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr Blair appointed a leading QC, the former Treasury counsel Sir Anthony Hammond, to examine the way the Hinduja passport was eventually granted in March 1999 - although the prime minister told MPs that he and Jack Straw, the home secretary, were satisfied that it was properly done.</p> <p>But the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, wrote to Mr Straw last night demanding the he makes a Commons statement on the whole affair.</p> <p><b>Full text</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427516,00.html\">The resignation speech</a></p> <p><b>Special report</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/nireland/\">Northern Ireland</a></p> <p><b>Photo gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gall/0,8542,427511,00.html\">Mandelson: a career in pictures</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124mandelson.ra\">Peter Mandelson announces his resignation (3mins 30)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124white.ra\">Michael White at Westminster (2mins 14)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/  news/politics/0124wainwright.ra\">Martin Wainwright in Hartlepool (3mins 55)</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427479,00.html\">24.01.2001: Mandelson resigns</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427569,00.html\">24.01.2001: Blair backs 'courageous' Mandelson </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427562,00.html\">24.01.2001: Benjamin Wegg-Prosser: the Mandelson I knew</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427481,00.html\">24.01.2001: Analysis by Nicholas Watt - Farewell Mandelson, brilliant but unloved</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427491,00.html\">24.01.2001: Fish and sympathy from Mandelson's Hartlepool constituency</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427558,00.html\">24.01.2001: Analysis: Resignation upsets pot as Irish stew </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427475,00.html\">24.01.2001: The hands-on Hindujas</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,427264,00.html\">Profile: Srichand Hinduja</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427465,00.html\">24.01.2001: Passport row lands Mandelson in trouble</a></p> <p><b>Andrew Rawnsley: inside New Labour</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369240,00.html\">Mandelson resigns over his home loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,369238,00.html\">Rivals in the Labour party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/Story/0,2763,366690,00.html\">How Mandy replaced Mo</a></p> <p><b>Cartoon</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,427417,00.html\">Steve Bell on Peter Mandelson</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e6ee\">Have your say: should Mandelson have quit?</a></p> <p><b>The 1998 home loan row</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427485,00.html\">Text of resignation letter</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427469,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson, the minister and the \u00a3373,000 loan</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mandelson/story/0,7369,427471,00.html\">24.12.1998: Mandelson: undone by a story that could not be done</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.hindujagroup.com/history.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hinduja group history</a><br><a href=\"http://www.number-10.gov.uk/default.asp?PageID=3291\" target=\"_new\">Press briefing</a><br><a href=\"http://www.nio.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Northern Ireland Office</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hartlepoolmail.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Hartlepool Mail</a><br><a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Belfast Telegraph</a></p>",

In a day of high drama not equalled at Westminster since Mr Mandelson's previous resignation, over his secret home loan in 1998, the man who helped to craft New Labour's modernising image for 15 years stepped down as the Northern Ireland secretary and renounced all strategic responsibility for the coming general election. Waking up to a barrage of hostile headlines yesterday, both Tony Blair and Mr Mandelson almost certainly knew it was all over by the time they met at number 10 in mid-morning. Three hours later came an apologetic resignation statement in the street outside. Before the meeting the prime minister's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, had refused to endorse the Northern Ireland secretary when he briefed reporters. \"The prime minister has got to face the House of Commons this afternoon and there are a number of areas of fact he feels the need to pin down.\" In their hour-long meeting Mr Blair and his most trusted aide discussed why the media, Mr Campbell and ministers were misled for 48 hours about Mr Mandelson's single phone call to Mike O'Brien, the immigration minister, in June 1998. Mr Mandelson insisted he had done nothing improper, but accepted that he had not told the whole truth about his intervention in the application for naturalisation by Srichanda Hinduja, a wealthy Indian businessman. After revelations in the Observer on Sunday, Mr Mandelson had insisted that he had merely asked his private office to pass on a request for information regarding a possible application from Mr Hinduja to the Home Office in June 1998. In fact he made the crucial two-minute phone call in person. In the same month the Hinduja brothers offered to sponsor the faith zone at the Millennium Dome. Mr Mandelson, as the cabinet office minister, was in charge of the Greenwich project. Mr Mandelson, who was out of office for 10 months after the Guardian's revelations about his \u00a3373,000 home loan from Geoffrey Robinson, is now entitled to his second ministerial pay-off, of \u00a312,129, in just over two years. Yesterday insiders emphatically denied that Mr Campbell had threatened to resign if Mr Mandelson did not. There was no need to do so, MPs agreed. The minister's inconsistencies, in private and on also television on Tuesday night, were all too evident. \"If Tony ever had to choose between Peter and Alastair, Alastair would win. He is the long distance runner, Peter the sprinter,\" one Labour veteran explained. Mr Campbell later confirmed that Mr Mandelson would not be taking part in Labour's general election campaign. \"I think Peter's making clear from his statement that he is clearly looking to wind down his political activity,\" he said. Mr Mandelson's exit leaves the chancellor, Gordon Brown, in a much stronger position. He and his close ally, Douglas Alexander, will now be in complete charge at Millbank, the party's headquarters. Mr Mandelson had been responsible for the nuts and bolts planning for the election. Last night there was even doubt about whether Mr Mandelson would stay on as an MP. Tim Allan, a former Downing Street press officer and friend of Mr Mandelson, said the member for Hartlepool would think \"long and hard\" before dropping his constituency, and insisted that he would want to remain in public life. In his statement Mr Mandelson denied \"acting improperly\" over Mr Hinduja's passport bid, but admitted: \"I do accept that when my office spoke to a Sunday newspaper at the weekend I should have been clear that it was me personally, not my officials, who spoke to a Home Office minister.\" He also attacked the media for its relentless vilification of his political role as a pro- European, pro-Lib-Lab moderate, and for its interest in his private life. \"I want to remove myself from the countless stories of controversy, feuds and division and all the rest. I want in other words to lead a more normal life, both in politics and, in the future, outside,\" he said. In the Commons, William Hague gleefully denounced the prime minister's \"monumental error of judgment\" in giving his old friend a second chance in 1999 - leaving Mr Blair loyally to defend the achievements of the flawed colleague who sat grim-faced at his side. But few Tories believe their own election chances have been much improved. \"William has 24 hours to make this stick to Blair,\" said one MP. The Tory leader did so by claiming that Mr Mandelson had been \"central to everything you have done\" - from spin to smears on colleagues. The Liberal leader, Charles Kennedy, joined Mr Blair in saying it was Mr Hague who had demeaned himself. Downing Street last night moved to replace Mr Mandelson at what is seen as a crucial stage in the Northern Ireland peace process, giving the job to the Scottish secretary, John Reid. He is replaced, in turn, by Helen Liddell. Meanwhile, Mr Blair appointed a leading QC, the former Treasury counsel Sir Anthony Hammond, to examine the way the Hinduja passport was eventually granted in March 1999 - although the prime minister told MPs that he and Jack Straw, the home secretary, were satisfied that it was properly done. But the shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, wrote to Mr Straw last night demanding the he makes a Commons statement on the whole affair.

He arrived to a crisis and he leaves in the middle of another, although he achieved what no one else has done for 30 years - handing over power to a locally elected government. From the outside, the timing of his departure, at such a critical juncture in the peace process, seems devastating. His successor, however experienced, will have to spend some time getting into position, and with the general election looming and unionist disillusionment with the Good Friday agreement hardening, every day counts. However, a change of personnel might not prove too problematic and Tony Blair as always is sure to keep a tight rein on proceedings. As Mr Mandelson became aware the minute he set foot in the province, Ulster politics is a zero sum game - when one side cries foul the other cheers. Just as his predecessor, Mo Mowlam, was seen as more sympathetic to nationalists, he was thought to lean toward unionists, who lobbied for his appointment.

      "bodyText": "Even Jesus Christ did not earn a second resurrection, and there is no chance of Peter Mandelson ever rising again inside the Labour party he did so much to recreate. On the verge of a historic second term, Labour's election campaign will not benefit from Mr Mandelson's strategic mind, and it is unlikely that the former Northern Ireland secretary will even stand again in Hartlepool. At 47, he is part of Labour's history, albeit a large partfor his role in making Labour electable again. Any attempt by Blair to restore his friend again, even in five years time, would be met with an armed phalanx of cabinet members, MPs and party activists blocking his path. Mr Mandelson once said of himself: \"I was the agent, the publicist and the spin doctor of the modernisers' cause\". But his departure does not mark the end of the Blairites. Instead it probably marks the final stage in the party's over-long transition from a campaigning party of opposition to a party of day to day government. It is very different from his first resignation in December 1998 over the \u00a3373,000 loan from the paymaster general, Geoffrey Robinson. Then the possibility of redemption was explicit.

Denis MacShane, the Rotherham MP and Labour chairman of a group of 70 MPs interested in the industry - said Corus seemed determined to push ahead with its closure plans despite offers of help and a turnaround in its fortunes caused by the strengthening euro against the pound. He said: \"We were surprised to learn from [industry secre tary] Stephen Byers that Corus had turned down a generous financial package from Whitehall and the Welsh administration which would have helped Corus get through their short-term difficulties caused by the pound-euro imbalance.\" Part of a Welsh aid package, worth up to \u00a320m, would include measures to ease Corus's liabilities under the new climate change levy or energy tax, which comes into force on April 1, the defer business rates and training grants. The measures are explicitly designed to escape scrutiny by the European Union competition authorities. Corus insisted, however, that it had received no formal offer of a financial package but said it was continuing to talk to the Department of Trade and Industry about assistance for the company in future. Sir Brian is under pressure from the City to act because losses in British carbon steelmaking last year approached \u00a3500m.",

      "bodyText": "Disaster workers were preparing to straighten the wrecked and half-submerged tanker Jessica yesterday, hoping to pump out the few thousand litres of diesel fuel remaining in its tanks. The vessel, whose cargo has been threatening the Galapagos Islands with a major ecological disaster since it ran aground last week, lies on a reef less than a mile from the main island, San Cristobal. Commander Jaime Samariego of the Ecuadorian navy, who is directing operations on the pier outside the island's naval base, from where the stricken ship is clearly visible, said that if the good conditions were to continue the ship could be straightened in a matter of hours. A US coastguard team called in to help manage the emergency declared by the Ecuadorian government estimated that 34,000 litres (9,000 gallons) of the original cargo of 946,000 litres of diesel and bunker fuel remained. Favourable winds and currents have been crucial in helping to save the Galapagos from total catastrophe by pushing the spill away from the shore, further diluting it, and allowing accelerated evaporation during several helpfully sunny days. Such weather has reduced the chances of permanent ecological damage to the archipelago, whose many unique species of wildlife inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. But the high swells accompanying the new moon have so far deterred the Ecuadorian navy and its US helpers from trying to put the Jessica back on an even keel: surf crashing over a deck pitched at a 50-degree angle is hampering the attachment of the necessary cables. \"The ship is in a really bad shape,\" the US coastguard commander, Captain Edwin Stanton, said after a morning visit to the wreck. But he insisted that it was unlikely to break up. Nevertheless, the danger remains. The Galapagos has notoriously unpredictable currents which could cause havoc to the islands' wildlife if it sends the spill back towards the shore. The rusting ship, built in 1973, ran aground on Tuesday last week, apparently as a result of sloppy navigation as it attempted to enter port and deliver its cargo, including the dangerous bunker fuel for the tourist boats which operate on of the island. Most of the cargo leaked out at the weekend, leaving one tank with 72,000 litres of bunker fuel intact. But it, too, cracked on Tuesday night, prompting a scramble to encircle the new spill with an absorbent necklace while workers doused it with dispersants. The local authorities warned people yesterday not to bathe around the islands because the still water could be hiding chemicals. The Charles Darwin research centre on the island reported that damage had so far been limited, primarily affecting pelicans, more than a dozen of which had been found coated with oil. Several other species are also threatened, including sea lions and blue-footed booby birds. Winds and currents have taken the spill away from the colonies of lava gulls, unique to the archipelago. The world-famous giant turtles were never thought to be in danger, because they live inland. Local and international ecological groups continue to monitor the situation, however, and some have warned that the real ecological impact could still prove significant, given the delicacy of the islands' ecosystem. www.darwinfoundation.org Darwin Foundation cleanup appeal www.gct.org Galapagos Conservation Trust (UK charity) www.uscg.mil/hq/nsfcc/nsfweb US coastguard's national strike force",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If you go to northern Chile, the windy desert strip between the Andes and the Pacific, you may find yourself wondering about all the soldiers. There are signs for army reservations by the empty roadsides, screened-off military sections at each dusty airport, barracks in the dry distance on the edge of every town. But deserts suit soldiers, here and elsewhere - they can secretly test new weapons in the dunes, race their tanks around without offending farmers, and, if so inclined, do bad things to civilians without people learning the details. </p> <p>The latter, at least, was the theory in October 1973. General Pinochet's military junta had seized overall control of Chile the previous month, using surprise and armoured vehicles to capture the capital, Santiago, and the country's main port, Valparaiso. But up in the Atacama desert, these events were hundreds of miles distant and could have been deemed irrelevant. Chile had a history of rebellions by the north against new regimes in Santiago. Early on the morning of October 16, Pinochet dispatched a heavily armed helicopter northwards from the capital. Its journey became known as the Caravan of Death. </p> <p>In three days, over 70 people were executed. The helicopter would land in a town and unload its troops in full combat dress. They would march into the local barracks, and demand a list of those still being held there after the coup. The commander of the helicopter would produce a red pencil. Names would be ticked - prominent trade unionists, left-wingers, alleged coup opponents, and \"subversives\" of all kinds. The commander would retire for lunch. Once he'd eaten, and the blinding sun had lowered a little, a firing squad would be assembled. Afterwards, the helicopter would fly on. </p> <p>The Caravan of Death would probably make a grim footnote for historians, rather than a whole documentary, presented by Isobel Hilton, in BBC2's Correspondent series, had it not had unintended consequences. The lonely shootings and burials were never as discreet as planned - the victims had determined rela tions, and the killings could be linked, quite directly, to General Pinochet. Since his arrest in London in October 1998, and during the resulting steady erosion of his reputation at home and abroad, the desert murders have become his pursuers' central piece of evidence. </p> <p>Here is an episode of deliberate state cruelty, they say, that melts the fog of euphemism and evasion with which Pinochet and his supporters usually cloak the activities of his regime. The purpose of the Caravan was explicitly to cause suffering and terror - parts of victims' faces were torn off before burial - and so discourage dissent for good across a vast, hard-to-police region. From 1973 until Pinochet's reluctant handover of power in 1990, this strategy essentially succeeded. Since then, people have begun to poke around in the cemeteries of northern Chile. </p> <p>The appeal of all this as a TV investigation is obvious. There's the horrible melodrama of the progress of the helicopter. Then there's its continuing news value, with Pinochet being questioned in Chile for the first time this week, specifically about the atrocities in the north. And, perhaps most enticing of all, there are the glimpses that can be provided of this thin, mysterious country whose internal agonies came recently but fleetingly to British attention. </p> <p>After the indoor complexities of the Pinochet case in London, the great caramel-coloured vistas of the Atacama Desert used in this programme come as a bracing surprise. Films about Pinochet rarely leave grey, modern Santiago; this one has the remote mining towns, telegraph poles and towering barren hills that have made Chile the slightly feverish, claustrophobic society it is. In a couple of memorable scenes, Juan Guzman, the magistrate leading the investigation into Pinochet's cruelties in Chile, is filmed out in the desert looking for traces of the Caravan. He and his detectives form a tiny dark knot in their official windcheaters and sunglasses, busily criss-crossing the dunes and scrub. But when the camera draws back, you see the physical immensity of their task. </p> <p>There's a depressing interview with a retired general, moustache grey and stiff as the ex-dictator's, who still talks unblinkingly about the need in 1973 to \"neutralise the extremists\". Guzman himself speaks, carefully pursing his mouth and keeping his small eyes on the journalists to all sides.

      "bodyText": "If you go to northern Chile, the windy desert strip between the Andes and the Pacific, you may find yourself wondering about all the soldiers. There are signs for army reservations by the empty roadsides, screened-off military sections at each dusty airport, barracks in the dry distance on the edge of every town. But deserts suit soldiers, here and elsewhere - they can secretly test new weapons in the dunes, race their tanks around without offending farmers, and, if so inclined, do bad things to civilians without people learning the details. The latter, at least, was the theory in October 1973. General Pinochet's military junta had seized overall control of Chile the previous month, using surprise and armoured vehicles to capture the capital, Santiago, and the country's main port, Valparaiso. But up in the Atacama desert, these events were hundreds of miles distant and could have been deemed irrelevant. Chile had a history of rebellions by the north against new regimes in Santiago. Early on the morning of October 16, Pinochet dispatched a heavily armed helicopter northwards from the capital. Its journey became known as the Caravan of Death. In three days, over 70 people were executed. The helicopter would land in a town and unload its troops in full combat dress. They would march into the local barracks, and demand a list of those still being held there after the coup. The commander of the helicopter would produce a red pencil. Names would be ticked - prominent trade unionists, left-wingers, alleged coup opponents, and \"subversives\" of all kinds. The commander would retire for lunch. Once he'd eaten, and the blinding sun had lowered a little, a firing squad would be assembled. Afterwards, the helicopter would fly on. The Caravan of Death would probably make a grim footnote for historians, rather than a whole documentary, presented by Isobel Hilton, in BBC2's Correspondent series, had it not had unintended consequences. The lonely shootings and burials were never as discreet as planned - the victims had determined rela tions, and the killings could be linked, quite directly, to General Pinochet. Since his arrest in London in October 1998, and during the resulting steady erosion of his reputation at home and abroad, the desert murders have become his pursuers' central piece of evidence. Here is an episode of deliberate state cruelty, they say, that melts the fog of euphemism and evasion with which Pinochet and his supporters usually cloak the activities of his regime. The purpose of the Caravan was explicitly to cause suffering and terror - parts of victims' faces were torn off before burial - and so discourage dissent for good across a vast, hard-to-police region. From 1973 until Pinochet's reluctant handover of power in 1990, this strategy essentially succeeded. Since then, people have begun to poke around in the cemeteries of northern Chile. The appeal of all this as a TV investigation is obvious. There's the horrible melodrama of the progress of the helicopter. Then there's its continuing news value, with Pinochet being questioned in Chile for the first time this week, specifically about the atrocities in the north. And, perhaps most enticing of all, there are the glimpses that can be provided of this thin, mysterious country whose internal agonies came recently but fleetingly to British attention. After the indoor complexities of the Pinochet case in London, the great caramel-coloured vistas of the Atacama Desert used in this programme come as a bracing surprise. Films about Pinochet rarely leave grey, modern Santiago; this one has the remote mining towns, telegraph poles and towering barren hills that have made Chile the slightly feverish, claustrophobic society it is. In a couple of memorable scenes, Juan Guzman, the magistrate leading the investigation into Pinochet's cruelties in Chile, is filmed out in the desert looking for traces of the Caravan. He and his detectives form a tiny dark knot in their official windcheaters and sunglasses, busily criss-crossing the dunes and scrub. But when the camera draws back, you see the physical immensity of their task. There's a depressing interview with a retired general, moustache grey and stiff as the ex-dictator's, who still talks unblinkingly about the need in 1973 to \"neutralise the extremists\". Guzman himself speaks, carefully pursing his mouth and keeping his small eyes on the journalists to all sides. And there are painful close-up interrogations of the still grieving friends and relations of those murdered that October. The survivors' steady gazes and concrete memories suggest why Pinochet hasn't escaped a form of retribution. The only problem is the absence of actual footage of the General's roving shock troops. This is often a difficulty for documentaries about hidden state brutalities - the viewer has to imagine what happened, via black and white family snaps of the victims, taken long before the crime; through the belated return of the film-makers to the place where blood was spilled; and by testimony lacking any detailed contribution from the people responsible. At times, the programme relies too heavily on spooky recreations, ominous tracking shots of guard towers and barbed wire, and pictures of modern Chilean soldiers, who weren't born in 1973, standing in for the men in the helicopter. Then again, the army still isn't cooperating fully with Guzman. Recent efforts to excavate bodies supposedly hidden nearer Santiago have ended in false trails. And the find of the film is probably a retired junior officer, himself a torture victim of the Caravan of Death for being too lenient to prisoners. He is still banned from all military bases. \u0095 Correspondent: Caravan of Death, Saturday, 7pm, BBC2. Andy Beckett is currently writing a book about Britain and Chile.",

      "body": "<p>The trumpeter Don Cherry once defined world music as the sound \"of those who have been listening and travelling\". Cherry did a great deal of both, visiting village musicians on three continents. A widening throng has since inherited his vision, including pianist Nikki Yeoh and vocalist and DJ Cleveland Watkiss. </p> <p>This pair's travels, inside and outside their heads, will inform their appearance together tomorrow at London's Spitz as part of the Serious Sampler series, a project set up to bring together players who are not regular partners. Yeoh and Watkiss disarmingly say their repertoire will be \"our experiences\". </p> <p>Yeoh's recent experiences have included hanging out in New York with McCoy Tyner and Rachel Z (\"doing a bit of playing, but a lot more checking out\") and piano lessons in Cuba with Chucho Valdes and Reuben Gonzalez.

Cherry did a great deal of both, visiting village musicians on three continents. A widening throng has since inherited his vision, including pianist Nikki Yeoh and vocalist and DJ Cleveland Watkiss. This pair's travels, inside and outside their heads, will inform their appearance together tomorrow at London's Spitz as part of the Serious Sampler series, a project set up to bring together players who are not regular partners. Yeoh and Watkiss disarmingly say their repertoire will be \"our experiences\". Yeoh's recent experiences have included hanging out in New York with McCoy Tyner and Rachel Z (\"doing a bit of playing, but a lot more checking out\") and piano lessons in Cuba with Chucho Valdes and Reuben Gonzalez. Watkiss, a disciple of Bobby McFerrin, Al Jarreau and Cassandra Wilson who strays far beyond jazz, has been recording, DJ-ing, and pursuing his Club 21st Century project, \"uniting impro, technology and DJ culture\".

This is a question difficult even to raise. The relation between mother and child has for centuries, and in every culture, been sacrosanct. Worship of the Virgin Mary did not arise out of the blue: it was built upon an already deep mythology. When Christ on the cross said to his mother: \"Woman, behold thy son\" and to his beloved disciple: \"Behold thy mother\", it was to this mythology he so movingly appealed. Swearing on one's mother's grave is the most solemn oath and even to this day it is mildly shocking to hear people speaking ill of their mothers.</p> <p>This may lie at the root of the very common assumption that women who have never had children have never entered the most profound relationship that there could be and are therefore less than fully human. \"Nature\" has been denied or defied. This assumption is still made, without any conscious thought. On the scale of those to be pitied, the women at the top are those who are thought to have no sexual relations with men (\"spinsters\"); but as a close second come those who do have such relations, but have no children.</p> <p>It is astonishing that such almost instinctive reactions, usually quickly suppressed, still exist, for example in people seeking to appoint women to senior posts such as those of head teacher or consultant. The irrational thing is that ever since contraception became readily available and almost morally obligatory, it must have been obvious women had the option of not having children. Yet such women are often regarded as somehow defective.</p> <p>I have to admit to finding the decision not to have children depressing. It suggests a Larkin-like pessimism: \"Man hands on misery to man/It deepens like a coastal shelf/Get out as early as you can/And don't have any kids yourself.\"</p> <p>But people are not defective if they are pessimistic - and their decision may even be a sign of optimism. They may be confident that there is enough purpose and value in their lives without needing children to give them a reason for living.</p> <p>Of course attitudes to the childless are not consistently held. Motherhood may be sacred but it has to be embarked upon in the right conditions. Teenage girls who become pregnant and do not consider abortion, who actually enjoy and love their babies and want to look after them and give them everything they can, are not much admired by society.</p> <p>Even respectably married women who do not go out to work are apologetic about being \"just a mother\". (They are also increasingly rare: financially, it is a difficult path to choose and in any case most women admit that they would find the role too tedious in the long run.) And there is an increasing recognition that whatever may be said about the wonders of having a baby, there are great drawbacks. \"There is no more sombre enemy of good art than the pram in the hall,\" as Cyril Connolly put it.</p> <p>So what are we to think about the obsessively maternal Bezant? Most people pronounce her mad, then go on to suggest that her twins, if they survive, will have a pretty weird childhood. Similarly, Alan and Judith Kilshaw, who adopted their twins via the internet, have been pilloried for \"buying\" them.</p> <p>But many people are led to more general reflections about the so-called commodification of babies, exemplified by the choices that can now be made (and which will become even wider) about what kind of baby you want, or don't want, whether you would like to have a stock of embryos refrigerated so that you can have a baby when it fits in with your other plans, and so forth.</p> <p>It seems to me that it is certainly justifiable to make such choices if they will prevent the birth of children who will suffer from disastrous inherited diseases. But beyond that, \"designer babies\" are, in my view, to be deeply deplored. I used to think that my moral objection to the concept was based on the fact, as I believe it to be, that such children would suffer, if they did not come up to scratch; and that, in any case, they were being treated as instruments to satisfy their parents' ambitions or other tastes. But I now think that, besides these relatively rational arguments, there are deep sentiments involved.</p> <p>Consider the case of surrogacy, where a man, whether he does or does not have a female partner, may choose from a catalogue a woman to give birth to his child. She, the surrogate, contracts to become pregnant using his sperm and to hand over the baby when it is born. I used to think that this was simply a vulgarisation of childbirth, both on the part of the commissioning man or couple and on the part of the surrogate herself. And it is true that some of the agencies to be found in the US are supremely vulgar.</p> <p>But perhaps my objection to the process derives, after all, from an ineradicable sense of what motherhood is like, a sense arising from experience. There is, literally, nothing like the excitement of the eventual existence of a new life that you yourself have caused to exist, or which at least could not have existed without you. The perhaps trivial element of surprise - not knowing which sex the baby would be or what it would look like - was, for me, part of the pleasure, like a secretly saved up Christmas present. But the non-trivial part was the amazingness of nature.</p> <p>So perhaps what I am saying is that motherhood is somehow sacred, as other aspects of nature may be; and if babies become commodities, we shall have lost something irreplaceable. Not all women need have babies; they are neither morally nor biologically defective if they do not. Women are more than their wombs.

      "body": "<p>How much ink can you get on a sheet of paper? A lot if, like Rembrandt, you use a drypoint needle to roughen the surface of your copper printing plate, leaving burred canals into which ink pools and clogs, so that when a sheet of paper is pressed against it, it is drowned in blackness. </p> <p>Take his print The Entombment (circa 1654), currently on display in London as part of Rembrandt the Printmaker, an exhibition by the British Museum and Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum that brings together the two greatest collections of Rembrandt's prints. Even today, after all the black paintings of modernism, the second \"state\" of this print is a baffling thing to be confronted with. </p> <p>The \"states\" of a print are the various versions an artist makes from the same copper plate, adding or removing effects. The Entombment begins as a shadowy but legible picture of the dead Christ being mourned by his followers inside a vaulted tomb. But then Rembrandt so overloads it with ink that looking at the resulting print is like closing your eyes and looking at your eyelids. Shapes emerge out of what at first seems absolute darkness. There is the body of Christ, lit by the weak glow of the last light in the world. It is unforgettable. </p> <p>Prints rarely get people going like paintings. Rembrandt's prints are the exception because they seize on the starkness of the medium. The second state of The Entombment is printed on vellum, which is less absorbent than paper. So the ink stays on the surface, which makes it all the more liquid, more profound. You could never get this particular yielding yet indestructible, smooth yet matt blackness in oil paints. It is a property of ink. For Rembrandt, the technical becomes metaphysical. The values he attaches to black and white are not simple. Black ink massed on the paper can look rich, solid, consoling; paper left blank can be terrifying. </p> <p>Blackness for Rembrandt can evoke the secluded, inner sanctum of the soul, or the world of sleep: a state he depicts repeatedly, in a study of a dog in its kennel, or another of his sick wife Saskia in bed - a moment that makes you want to cry, though not as much as the one of her in bed awake, her eyes listless and despairing. </p> <p>Indeed, the first thing that takes your breath away in this chronological exhibition is The Angel Appearing to the Shepherds, Rembrandt's earliest nocturne, from 1634. Rembrandt loves the dark, relishes each obscure tendril of ivy, each woody recess, as the shepherds' night is disturbed by the shining apparition. </p> <p>Rembrandt etched 300 images in his life. Why? It would be nice to think that it was to make his art available to a wider audience. In Amsterdam in the 17th century, prints were used for everything from political propaganda to advertising to disseminating fine art. Rembrandt never went to Italy, but he owned prints of the work of Raphael, Michelangelo and Titian, as well as classics of printmaking by artists such as D\u00fcrer. Rembrandt emulated these printmakers early in his career in Leiden, and his first fumbling attempts - which were followed by a rapid assimilation of the medium's possibilities - are here. </p> <p>It is tempting to believe that Rembrandt turned to printing to make his art more accessible, but this is not so. His prints were made in small editions and were astronomically expensive. In fact, he ensured that his prints were as costly as possible by using rare, highly priced papers - he even imported some from Japan - and his favourite drypoint technique, which could produce only a few copies before the plate became worn. One of his most famous editions is known as the Hundred Guilder Print because of its record price. </p> <p>Rembrandt etched everything: nudes, a pig about to be slaughtered, street sellers, a man and woman pissing and shitting, Amsterdam burghers, Christ presented to the crowd by Pontius Pilate. His landscapes are so acutely drawn that it is thought he sometimes took a copper plate into the countryside and drew on it directly from nature. Then there are strange prints consisting of several loose sketches, including very private ones of Saskia, which he released. The only explanation is that there was a demand not just for his finished masterpieces, but for evidence of his creative process. </p> <p>Rembrandt was the first artist to set himself apart as an autonomous creator whose sole concern was to express his inner feelings. This is why he relished printing several, varying states of the same copper plate - so we can see him struggling for the perfect expression of his thoughts. </p> <p>In the five states exhibited here of Christ Presented to the People (1655), done entirely in drypoint with its sensual massing of ink, you can see him increase the iconic power of the image by deciding after a couple of attempts to remove a crowd of beautifully drawn figures from the front of the picture, wiping them out, so what all we see is Christ standing directly before us. The stone wall below him is devastating in its blankness. </p> <p>The most awe-inspiring image in a show of pure, inky magnificence, full of things that etch themselves permanently on the imagination, is The Three Crosses (1653). Veils of blackness swallow up the crying crowd, choke and blind the world. The blinding is carried out with sharp, hard rods of ink - straight, emotionless lines that Rembrandt sends down from above. </p> <p>The ink parts to delineate a pyramid of light aimed from heaven straight at Christ. Yet this light is the most violent thing of all. It is a remorseless searchlight beam. You would not want to be caught in it, guilty, at this crime scene.</p> <p>\u0095 Rembrandt the Printmaker is at the British Museum, London WC1 (020-7323 8000), until April 8.</p>",

Blackness for Rembrandt can evoke the secluded, inner sanctum of the soul, or the world of sleep: a state he depicts repeatedly, in a study of a dog in its kennel, or another of his sick wife Saskia in bed - a moment that makes you want to cry, though not as much as the one of her in bed awake, her eyes listless and despairing. Indeed, the first thing that takes your breath away in this chronological exhibition is The Angel Appearing to the Shepherds, Rembrandt's earliest nocturne, from 1634. Rembrandt loves the dark, relishes each obscure tendril of ivy, each woody recess, as the shepherds' night is disturbed by the shining apparition. Rembrandt etched 300 images in his life. Why? It would be nice to think that it was to make his art available to a wider audience. In Amsterdam in the 17th century, prints were used for everything from political propaganda to advertising to disseminating fine art. Rembrandt never went to Italy, but he owned prints of the work of Raphael, Michelangelo and Titian, as well as classics of printmaking by artists such as D\u00fcrer. Rembrandt emulated these printmakers early in his career in Leiden, and his first fumbling attempts - which were followed by a rapid assimilation of the medium's possibilities - are here. It is tempting to believe that Rembrandt turned to printing to make his art more accessible, but this is not so. His prints were made in small editions and were astronomically expensive. In fact, he ensured that his prints were as costly as possible by using rare, highly priced papers - he even imported some from Japan - and his favourite drypoint technique, which could produce only a few copies before the plate became worn. One of his most famous editions is known as the Hundred Guilder Print because of its record price. Rembrandt etched everything: nudes, a pig about to be slaughtered, street sellers, a man and woman pissing and shitting, Amsterdam burghers, Christ presented to the crowd by Pontius Pilate. His landscapes are so acutely drawn that it is thought he sometimes took a copper plate into the countryside and drew on it directly from nature. Then there are strange prints consisting of several loose sketches, including very private ones of Saskia, which he released. The only explanation is that there was a demand not just for his finished masterpieces, but for evidence of his creative process. Rembrandt was the first artist to set himself apart as an autonomous creator whose sole concern was to express his inner feelings. This is why he relished printing several, varying states of the same copper plate - so we can see him struggling for the perfect expression of his thoughts. In the five states exhibited here of Christ Presented to the People (1655), done entirely in drypoint with its sensual massing of ink, you can see him increase the iconic power of the image by deciding after a couple of attempts to remove a crowd of beautifully drawn figures from the front of the picture, wiping them out, so what all we see is Christ standing directly before us. The stone wall below him is devastating in its blankness. The most awe-inspiring image in a show of pure, inky magnificence, full of things that etch themselves permanently on the imagination, is The Three Crosses (1653). Veils of blackness swallow up the crying crowd, choke and blind the world. The blinding is carried out with sharp, hard rods of ink - straight, emotionless lines that Rembrandt sends down from above. The ink parts to delineate a pyramid of light aimed from heaven straight at Christ. Yet this light is the most violent thing of all. It is a remorseless searchlight beam. You would not want to be caught in it, guilty, at this crime scene. \u0095 Rembrandt the Printmaker is at the British Museum, London WC1 (020-7323 8000), until April 8.",

      "bodyText": "A highway code for wheelchair users and drivers of electric scooters was launched yesterday. Campaigners hope the government-backed code will help reduce accidents involving the rising number of people who use electric scooters. About three quarters of a million people in the UK use a wheelchair and thousands of elderly and disabled people drive electric scooters. But reports of pensioners driving their eight-mile-an-hour scooters along motorways and other dangerous incidents have raised concerns that many people are not in control of their vehicles. The Highway Code for Electric Scooter and Wheelchair Users has been produced by the British Healthcare Trades Association and is backed by the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions. Disabled scooter drivers do not fit into the traditional highway code categories as they are not considered to be cars or motorbikes but are not legally allowed to use cycle lanes. Electric scooter drivers must abide by a legal speed limit of 4mph on the pavement and 8mph on a road. The new code, called Get Wise, says: \"Remember pedestrians always have the right of way - do not yield to the temptation to ram them!\" Scooter drivers are also warned to reduce their speed when in shops and buildings. Another guide gives wheelchair users advice on how to travel safely on public transport. The code was written by Margaret Godfree, from Evington, Leicester, who has used an electric scooter for 12 years. Press Association",

      "body": "<p>Britain might be about to wave goodbye to the venture capital pickup club First Tuesday, but in the meantime Silicon Valley is saying hello to the Pink Slip party, the new bash of choice for the dot.com unemployed. </p> <p>Outside a trendy little nightclub in the SoMa (South of Market Street) district of San Francisco, at the epicentre of the dot.com revolution, the queue of ex-marketeers, managers, designers and the occasional programmer is stretching up the street. They are waiting - in the biting wind and driving rain - for a chance to party, and find themselves a new job. </p> <p>Inside the Glas Kat, DJ Spoon is spinning out some fashionably obscure European dance music while recruiters (they are wearing the green badges) and hopefuls (they have got pink) shuffle round the tightly packed dance floor, giving each other the once-over to determine their orientation before moving in with their line, and a firm handshake. \"Hi - you looking for a job?\" and \"Hey - you recruiting?\" are the chat-up lines de jour. </p> <p>While there are cheap drinks ($2 a pint) and cool sounds, there is no buffet and free goodies are few on the ground, bar a few t-shirts and caps from the evening's sponsors. A lot has changed since the glory days. </p> <p>Patti Beron, one of the night's organisers and editor of community site SFgirl.com, sums up the change in atmos phere. \"SFgirl.com had ridden the internet wave, listing all the launch parties and events, and built up this audience of people in the industry,\" she says. \"But suddenly all the talk on the notice boards was of 'hey, I'm losing my job' or 'we've had layoffs here'. </p> <p>\"And then I had a bunch of friends who were laid off and we were all sitting around drinking on the day they lost their jobs, and thought these parties would be a good idea.\" </p> <p>Boom time in Silicon Valley had brought with it some unexpected benefits. For Marcus Ronaldi, web developer and another leading light in the San Francisco social scene, the good times meant he didn't need to spend very much on groceries, or drink. </p> <p>\"Looking back on the, you know, the parties were just amazing,\" says Ronaldi, founder of the SFbayhappyhour.com party listings. He stares into the middle distance as he recalls the heady days when dot.coms were awash with venture capital - and full of great ideas on how to spend it. \"It was just phenomenal - I didn't go out at the weekends because the weekdays were so busy,\" he says. </p> <p>\"You would go to these launch parties and there would be fine food - lobster, bay shrimp, only the best. And the swag! There were T-shirts, of course, but they were also giving away things like Palm Pilots and digital cameras.\" </p> <p>The scene hit its high with a do thrown to celebrate the renaming of what is now Acteva.com. Acteva was a new e-commerce operation with a vague purpose - a \"marketplace for activities\" - but a very clear desire to party in a fashion which was, even by 1999 standards, lavish.

      "bodyText": "Britain might be about to wave goodbye to the venture capital pickup club First Tuesday, but in the meantime Silicon Valley is saying hello to the Pink Slip party, the new bash of choice for the dot.com unemployed. Outside a trendy little nightclub in the SoMa (South of Market Street) district of San Francisco, at the epicentre of the dot.com revolution, the queue of ex-marketeers, managers, designers and the occasional programmer is stretching up the street. They are waiting - in the biting wind and driving rain - for a chance to party, and find themselves a new job. Inside the Glas Kat, DJ Spoon is spinning out some fashionably obscure European dance music while recruiters (they are wearing the green badges) and hopefuls (they have got pink) shuffle round the tightly packed dance floor, giving each other the once-over to determine their orientation before moving in with their line, and a firm handshake. \"Hi - you looking for a job?\" and \"Hey - you recruiting?\" are the chat-up lines de jour. While there are cheap drinks ($2 a pint) and cool sounds, there is no buffet and free goodies are few on the ground, bar a few t-shirts and caps from the evening's sponsors. A lot has changed since the glory days. Patti Beron, one of the night's organisers and editor of community site SFgirl.com, sums up the change in atmos phere. \"SFgirl.com had ridden the internet wave, listing all the launch parties and events, and built up this audience of people in the industry,\" she says. \"But suddenly all the talk on the notice boards was of 'hey, I'm losing my job' or 'we've had layoffs here'. \"And then I had a bunch of friends who were laid off and we were all sitting around drinking on the day they lost their jobs, and thought these parties would be a good idea.\" Boom time in Silicon Valley had brought with it some unexpected benefits. For Marcus Ronaldi, web developer and another leading light in the San Francisco social scene, the good times meant he didn't need to spend very much on groceries, or drink. \"Looking back on the, you know, the parties were just amazing,\" says Ronaldi, founder of the SFbayhappyhour.com party listings. He stares into the middle distance as he recalls the heady days when dot.coms were awash with venture capital - and full of great ideas on how to spend it. \"It was just phenomenal - I didn't go out at the weekends because the weekdays were so busy,\" he says. \"You would go to these launch parties and there would be fine food - lobster, bay shrimp, only the best. And the swag! There were T-shirts, of course, but they were also giving away things like Palm Pilots and digital cameras.\" The scene hit its high with a do thrown to celebrate the renaming of what is now Acteva.com. Acteva was a new e-commerce operation with a vague purpose - a \"marketplace for activities\" - but a very clear desire to party in a fashion which was, even by 1999 standards, lavish. The entire crowd was bussed to a barracks and treated to a spectacular night's entertainment, complete with ice sculptures with shots of spirits running through them, and a presentation to the staffer who had come up with the name Acteva - he was given a Porsche. Dot.com staff were valued then. \"At that time,\" says Marcus, \"it was easier to find a job than get a parking ticket\". But then, as it had to, the bubble burst. Stock values plunged - dot.com bell wethers like Yahoo! lost over over 80% of their stock market value, and many smaller ventures which had ridden the wave of high-tech hype were wiped out. \"The statistic I've heard is that a dot.com dies a day,\" laughs Debbie Bonacci, a relentlessly cheerful partygoer who sports a pink sticker but who hasn't had to clear out her cubicle yet.

I moved here from New Jersey about a year and a half ago, wanted to experience the dot.com industry, and now I have.\" She is plotting a return to the east coast, and a move into old fashioned advertising. For Catherine Edwards, another pink dot, the business of finding a new job is a little more urgent. She was laid off just before Christmas from her job at an education startup serving primary-school age children - one of 30 people told they were no longer needed as the cash-starved business changed direction in a bid to survive.

These companies are clearly waking up to the possibilities of B2B e-commerce. </p> <p>\"I think the reason why the corporates are in a good position to make exchanges work is because they can push a big volume of trade through the exchanges,\" says Neil Cameron, Andersen's head of e-business. He points out that non-industry B2B exchanges, which do not have established relationships with suppliers, are struggling to get buyers and sellers trading online. \"There are very few levers they can pull to get them into the exchange.\" </p> <p>One of the leading retail B2B exchanges is the <a href=\"http://www.worldwideretailexchange.org\">Worldwide Retail Exchange</a> which can be accessed through a standard internet browser.

The offline process of ordering corned beef and seeing the suppliers agree the necessary specifications would normally take months.

Galvanised by its initial auction, the UK's leading supermarket chain is now considering which other contracts it can put out to an online auction. </p> <p>Meanwhile, suppliers are growing extremely nervous about these new online B2B developments. Many fear that major retailers are ganging up in exchanges to beat them down on price. But Knichel insists that trading through the exchange is not compulsory for Tesco's suppliers. \"We are not saying you must pay this price and you must work in this way. It's not something we are going to make a condition of trade,\" he explains. \"If we have a long-standing good working relationship with a supplier, it's unlikely that their contract is going to go through an auction.

In October last year it was announced that AirNewco was going to merge with MyAircraft <a href=\"http://www.myaircraft.com\" target=\"_new\">www.myaircraft.com</a>, a B2B exchange led by aerospace manufacturers. The new expanded venture is scheduled to go live early this year and will link buyers and sellers in key aviation operational areas such as fuel services, maintenance, engineering and catering. With headquarters in Washington DC, the new aviation exchange will offer exchange members supply chain management tools and auctions as part of its online services. </p> <p>Paul Alexander, procurement manager for British Airways, believes the exchange will reduce the number of aircraft spares that are created each year because manufacturers will have clearer and easier access to what the market is actually demanding. But he denies the exchange is just about price transactions and argues that the web will promote greater collaboration and faster product innovation. \"We think it will enable us to interact more efficiently with our suppliers.\" </p> <p>For example, designing aircraft seats can take up to 18 months from the drawing stage to being installed on a plane. But this could be significantly speeded up by doing the design work online. Alexander points out that the web will enable greater visibility right up the supply chain as the airline, design agency and the manufacturer will be able to log on to the same web pages to approve specifications and monitor the progress of design work. </p> <p>One of the most startling developments of industry-sponsored B2B e-commerce exchanges has been the level of cooperation between different retailers. Long-standing arch rivals such as Marks and Spencer, Safeway and Tesco have been sitting down together and discussing the way ahead.

Knichel adds, \"There are things we can do collectively better than we ever could individually.\" </p> <p> A constant issue for corporates is deciding which technology to invest in as it is changing so rapidly. One of the latest fashionable ideas emerging from Silicon Valley is the possible 'Napsterisation' of B2B. The idea is that companies will be able to use the same technology Napster uses to bypass central B2B exchanges and exchange information directly with one another. At the moment peer-to-peer networking technology is not sophisticated enough to handle complex business transactions on the web but it could soon be ready and would mean that companies would not have to pay the fees that central exchanges charge. </p> <p>Inevitably, software companies, whose business models are based on supplying platforms to centralized B2B exchanges, are defensive about the possible impact of new Napster-like technologies. \"Functionality within centralised exchanges is continually improving,\" argues Nick Mayo, head of e-markets for Clarus, a B2B software company. \"If transaction fees were high, there would be an economic incentive to find a way around that.

Colin McRae Rally 2.0 requires more skilful use of the brakes, and the trick is to slide round corners without hitting anything. Well, not too often, anyway. </p> <p>The other thing that sets it apart from most racing games is that you need to be sensitive to the road surface, which may of course be gravel, mud, sand or snow. Realism is the thing. CMR2 is reasonably forgiving, so even if you run straight into a tree, the car is not totalled, and you can continue after a second or two. </p> <p>On the other hand, the cars do take - and show - damage, which has to be repaired between races. Also, if you hit more than a couple of things, you may not finish high enough to earn a new track. This makes winning hard work. Without the co-driver who calls out the corners it would be even harder. </p> <p>In the latest version, the graphics are superb, and there are the expected new cars and extra tracks. CMR2 offers five different racing views: behind the car (near and far), a cockpit view, from the bonnet, and (road only) from the front bumper. The last is the most exciting way to play. It is also the hardest to win. If it is not enough to pit yourself against the elements and the times recorded by unseen opponents, CMR2 provides for both network and online play. There's also an alternate-play championship mode. For people who buy rally games by mistake, there's also a new arcade mode, which lets six boy racers go wheel-to-wheel round eight looped circuits. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the simulation does break down eventually. Even if you win the World Rally Championship at the highest level, there won't be an agent round to offer you \u00a35m a year to drive a Ford Focus. However, you will be able to earn bragging rights by uploading your high scores to the web. (JS)</p> <p><strong> Gunman Chronicles</strong> <br>PC CD-rom \u00a319.99 Valve/Sierra Studios *** <br> An \"all-new action experience powered by the Half-Life engine!\" proclaims the box. Sorry, box, but I have to take issue with that \"all-new\" bit. </p> <p>Certainly, the story and characters are new. Well, newish: instead of sharpshooting scientist Gordon Freeman, trying to stop an alien infestation wiping out the human race, you now play a sharpshooting soldier, at some indeterminate point in our future, trying to stop an alien infestation wiping out the human race. And in a nifty little addition, you can now commandeer vehicles to use against your foe. Well, you get to climb into a tank. Twice. </p> <p>Another minor difference: whereas Half-Life had a nice, easy learning curve that cranked up the difficulty level beautifully, Gunman Chronicles rather throws you in at the deep end (against a tank and a fortified gun turret). Once that's out of the way, though, things don't get an awful lot harder. </p> <p>Mastering the controls may be a problem, thanks to the only real innovation - your arsenal. There are about as many different weapons available as in Half-Life, but this time they are \"customisable\" - that is to say, each has up to 32 different configurations. Which means that in the later stages of the game, you'll have well over 100 firepower options to choose from. While it sounds impressive, selecting the correct weapon and the ideal configuration in the heat of battle is about as easy as taking candy from a 22-stone wrestler with a sweet tooth. </p> <p>These points aside, Gunman Chronicles will give all Half-Life fans a serious case of deja vu. The graphics are identical, right down to the endless list of video card compatibility issues. The gameplay is still frustratingly (and yet ingeniously) linear. The credits sequence once again takes place on a monorail accompanied by a PA system, and there are even little creatures that leap out at you from the shadows. </p> <p>Most first-person shooter fans would be well advised to wait for Half-Life 2. For those who can't, however, Gunman Chronicles (aka Half-Life One and a Half) is a passable way of killing 20 hours or so. (AB) </p> <p><strong> Resident Evil 3: Nemesis </strong> <br> Sega Dreamcast \u00a339.99 Virgin/Capcom *** <br> Never mind zombies and ghoulish adversaries, the scariest thing about Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is that Capcom has released it at all. It's not that this is a bad game - although it is the weakest of the series - but releasing it on the Dreamcast is pointless. The reason? Code Veronica. </p> <p>Released last year, this Sega exclusive was the fourth Resident Evil game but, crucially, the first in proper 3D. Now your characters could interact with all their spooky surroundings while the processing oomph of the Dreamcast ensured no loss in graphical quality. </p> <p>It was a runaway success and effectively raised the bar for survival-horror games. So, it's odd then, that the game's markedly inferior prequel - albeit a hit on the aging PlayStation - has now made its way to the Dreamcast. </p> <p>Of course there have been plenty of additions, right? Er, not really. The graphics, 2D backdrops and all, have been slightly cleaned up while heroine Jill Valentine gets additional costumes to wear. Not exactly compelling reasons for Dreamcast owners to rush to the shops, then. </p> <p>However, it's not all bad news. If you haven't played it before then this is the best version available and, like all RE games, it has the addictive power to keep you going from dusk till dawn. This instalment also has more violence and fewer puzzles with the constant threat from the Nemesis himself an absorbing accompaniment. </p> <p>Still, minor enhancements or not, this is no match for the eight-month-old Code Veronica and is only recommended if you haven't played the PlayStation version.

Released last year, this Sega exclusive was the fourth Resident Evil game but, crucially, the first in proper 3D. Now your characters could interact with all their spooky surroundings while the processing oomph of the Dreamcast ensured no loss in graphical quality. It was a runaway success and effectively raised the bar for survival-horror games. So, it's odd then, that the game's markedly inferior prequel - albeit a hit on the aging PlayStation - has now made its way to the Dreamcast. Of course there have been plenty of additions, right? Er, not really. The graphics, 2D backdrops and all, have been slightly cleaned up while heroine Jill Valentine gets additional costumes to wear. Not exactly compelling reasons for Dreamcast owners to rush to the shops, then. However, it's not all bad news. If you haven't played it before then this is the best version available and, like all RE games, it has the addictive power to keep you going from dusk till dawn. This instalment also has more violence and fewer puzzles with the constant threat from the Nemesis himself an absorbing accompaniment. Still, minor enhancements or not, this is no match for the eight-month-old Code Veronica and is only recommended if you haven't played the PlayStation version. (GH)",

All that is asked in return is that anything built on the work of others must also be freely available and able to be modified. </p> <p>If this sounds quaintly idealistic but hopelessly irrelevant in the early 21st century, consider the fact that this free software not only made the net possible in the first place, but keeps it running to this day. The Bind program, software that ensures that the billions of pieces of data routed over the internet's wiring every second reach their correct destination, was written nearly 20 years ago, and given away. Sendmail, created by Eric Allman around the same time, is responsible for delivering over three-quarters of all email sent across the internet.

For example, two of the top internet business sites, Amazon.com and Yahoo, depend for their rich user experience on a programming language called Perl. Like the others, Perl was given away by its creator, Larry Wall, from the moment it existed. </p> <p>Free software has a deeply symbiotic relationship with the internet: it gave rise to it but also depends critically on it. Behind its creation lies no army of programmers in cubicles, as in conventional software companies, but a loose, net-based confederation of self-styled hackers - not to be confused with the malevolent \"crackers\", who break into computer systems. </p> <p>This novel way of crafting programs has little in common with the traditional, hierarchical approach based on centralised teams working in a directed way. Instead, free software builds on the fact that its underlying lines of programming - the source code - are always freely available for all to inspect and improve. </p> <p>As a result, anyone can contribute improvements to any part: all that matters is the quality of the code. This Darwinian dynamic allows free software to progress in a uniquely efficient way. The fact that nobody gets paid to work on the code turns out to be an advantage. Since hackers tend to work on areas they are passionate about, they generally produce better code than unmotivated software grunts ordered to work on a product feature they may have little sympathy for. </p> <p>Moreover, the free software approach scales: it can tackle ever-bigger and more complex projects without the managerial overhead that eventually brings conventional software production to its knees. </p> <p>The ability to focus on code quality, and the lack of corporate agendas that so often override engineering considerations elsewhere, means that free software possesses a reliability that is second to none. One reason that few people are aware there are programs running the internet is that they never crash in any significant way: the free software underlying the internet is reliable to the point of invisibility. </p> <p>This reliability, combined with zero cost, poses a serious challenge to commercial outfits trying to sell their often bug-ridden programs. No one is more affected by this dichotomy than Microsoft, the most successful company ever built on the traditional software model. </p> <p>Microsoft's flagship product, Windows 2000, not only has a direct competitor but a serious rival in GNU/Linux, a free clone of the commercial Unix operating system (see below, left). Earlier this month, Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's generally upbeat chief executive officer, publicly acknowledged this for the first time: \"I'd put the Linux phenomenon really as threat number one,\" he said. </p> <p>The motives for developing free software vary enormously. Some, like Richard Stallman, who started the GNU project which forms the framework for GNU/Linux and who drew up what amounts to a constitution for the free software world (see above, right), are driven by lofty ideals. For them, writing software for anyone to use and modify is about liberty - one reason why this wing prefers the label \"free software\" to \"open source\". </p> <p>Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, sees a religious dimension. Originally trained as a linguist, Wall had intended to become a Christian missionary in remote parts of the world before food allergies made that impractical. Instead, he started writing software and giving it away, in part so that others might have a similar opportunity for generosity by passing on their own improvements to his work - an effect that Wall has no qualms about describing as \"theological\". Many other hackers believe the sharing and sense of community engendered among users of their programs is a crucial facet. </p> <p>Hackers also seem to agree on one other key factor that drives their work. Within their world, the highest praise for code is that it is \"cool\", that it possesses a kind of hacker beauty. One of the free software patriarchs, Donald Knuth, has spent the past 40 years of his life on a monumental series of books called simply The Art of Computer Programming.

      "body": "<p>A Russian handheld computer is sweeping the American market, and should reach the UK before Christmas. But this is only the first part of a plan for world domination. The Cybiko \"inter-tainment computer\" may be aimed at teenagers, but an adult version is planned. Palm may not know, but it faces a stiff challenge. </p> <p>The Cybiko is a small, cheap ($99.95), plastic handheld computer: its looks give no indication of its potential impact. Its real power only emerges when you flip up the aerial on the back and find yourself in immediate contact with up to 99 more Cybiko users. The handheld's built-in two-way radio makes it a digital walkie-talkie. You can swap text messages with other users, and play games. </p> <p>Since it is based on short-range radio, text messaging is instant and free. That makes the Cybiko much more attractive than a mobile phone. </p> <p>Games are free, too. Cybiko Inc puts a new game on the web every day, and there are already more than 200. If you have a PC, you can download games and copy them to your Cybiko. If you don't have a PC, you can get someone else with a Cybiko to send them to you using the built-in radio. </p> <p>While a Cybiko is connected to a PC, it can also pick up electronic mail, although it is clearly not practical unless the handheld also has a $19.95 memory module plugged into the expansion slot on the back. Other plug-ins on the way include an MP3 player, an FM radio, a GSM phone, and a wireless modem. </p> <p>The Cybiko was developed in Moscow by Cybiko Inc, which was founded in 1999 by a young Chinese-Armenian, David Yang. He was already running a successful software company, <a href=\"http://www.abbyy.\">Abbyy</a>, which develops artificial intelligence products. He came up with the Cybiko when stuck in hospital, he says, \"and for the first time in my life, I had nothing to do.\" </p> <p>Yang researched the idea in six countries including the UK. \"Originally, we were targeting people about 20-30 years old,\" Yang says, \"but we found the highest interest was in the 13-17 range. We decided to go for that market because it is huge - 200m kids - and they don't have anything today. I invested my own money, my father invested, my company invested_\" Today, Cybiko Inc also has investment backing from Sun Technology and its subsidiary, Vesta Capital Partners, which are owned mainly by the Khemka family, from India. America Online's AOL Investments is another backer, and AOL will provide Cybiko with access to its proprietary instant messaging systems. </p> <p>With Cybiko computers being made in Taiwan for the US market, the Russian company is already operating globally, though the software and hardware development is still done in Moscow. </p> <p>The Cybiko is now spreading across the US like influenza. Launched in April,\"full-scale commercial sales\" began in September with a shipment of 42,000 units. That has now climbed to 500,000. </p> <p>The growth pattern follows from the Cybiko's limited range, which in the US is only 50-100m indoors, and 100-200m out of doors. If you have the only Cybiko for miles around, its uses are limited. However, once a few people have them, there is a strong incentive for their friends to get them as well. And as with mobile phones, once critical mass is reached, almost everyone has to have one. </p> <p>The free chat facilities and continuous supply of free games could make the Cybiko a \"must have\" accessory for teenagers in many schools. </p> <p>Better still, the Cybiko also has the ability to \"hop\" signals. Two Cybiko owners can thus communicate via a series of intermediate machines, owned by other people, in a peer-to-peer network. Yang says: \"It will be able to go over up to 10 hops. In big markets, we already have enough density to cover the whole of Manhattan.\" </p> <p>In Europe, things should be better still. Yang says the European system will use a different radio frequency, and local laws allow more power. This will give Cybikos a range of up to 1km outdoors. </p> <p>\"For the adult market, we have different usage scenarios,\" he says. The Cybiko already synchronises with Microsoft Outlook 2000, and the new hardware will be more like an organiser than a games machine. \"And,\" says Yang, \"not only will we provide Cybiko computers, we will also provide cartridges for Palms and PocketPCs like the [Compaq] iPaq.\" Rival devices will thus be absorbed into Cybiko networks. </p> <p>Cybiko Inc also offers \"a wireless internet gateway to connect [handhelds] to the local network in your office,\" he says. \"When you are walking across the car park, or going up in the elevator, you will already be reading your email and checking your messages.\" The CyWIG software - which is free and runs on a PC - is also being tested in shopping malls in America. (See <a href=\"http://www.cybiko.com/download/application/cwig.asp\">www.cybiko.com/download/application/cwig.asp</a>). </p> <p>The fact that Cybiko communications are free is a big incentive for companies to use the system. Yang says people don't want to pay $30 or $40 a month to a mobile phone or pager company for connectivity in their own homes and offices. </p> <p>Of course, many companies are already planning to install systems that perform the same functions as the Cybiko, using Bluetooth and standard Wi-Fi wireless networking (see <a href=\"http://www.wi-fi.org\">www.wi-fi.org</a>). </p> <p>Yang says: \"The second generation Cybiko will be Bluetooth-compatible, but Bluetooth has several disadvantages for us: the range is only 10m, and it does not do peer-to-peer networking.\" Basically, he thinks Bluetooth devices will add to the appeal of Cybiko networks, not replace them. </p> <p>Wi-Fi wireless networking offers more serious competition but Yang says it has the disadvantage of requiring a base station. Also, wireless networking with handheld computers such as Palms and PocketPCs is more expensive than with Cybiko's proprietary system, which is already available in a device that costs less than $100. </p> <p>Yang says Cybiko Inc considered using an existing operating system before writing its own. However, Palm OS was not up to the job, which required multi-tasking and multi-processing, while Microsoft's Windows CE, used in PocketPCs, needed too much expensive memory. Cybiko's operating system has a 30K core and the whole thing only takes up 70K. </p> <p>Bluetooth is the agreed standard for personal area networking: it is expected to become ubiquitous once it has been reduced to a single cheap chip and the software drivers are included in things like Windows. Wi-Fi is the agreed standard for wireless local area networks, and for connecting PCs and handhelds to internet networks: it could become ubiquitous by the same route. </p> <p>But the Cybiko is hard to resist, and at the price, it should sell by the shed-load. Whether the system will still be around in 10 years is another matter, but it will be fun while it lasts.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A Russian handheld computer is sweeping the American market, and should reach the UK before Christmas. But this is only the first part of a plan for world domination. The Cybiko \"inter-tainment computer\" may be aimed at teenagers, but an adult version is planned. Palm may not know, but it faces a stiff challenge. The Cybiko is a small, cheap ($99.95), plastic handheld computer: its looks give no indication of its potential impact. Its real power only emerges when you flip up the aerial on the back and find yourself in immediate contact with up to 99 more Cybiko users. The handheld's built-in two-way radio makes it a digital walkie-talkie. You can swap text messages with other users, and play games. Since it is based on short-range radio, text messaging is instant and free. That makes the Cybiko much more attractive than a mobile phone. Games are free, too. Cybiko Inc puts a new game on the web every day, and there are already more than 200. If you have a PC, you can download games and copy them to your Cybiko. If you don't have a PC, you can get someone else with a Cybiko to send them to you using the built-in radio. While a Cybiko is connected to a PC, it can also pick up electronic mail, although it is clearly not practical unless the handheld also has a $19.95 memory module plugged into the expansion slot on the back. Other plug-ins on the way include an MP3 player, an FM radio, a GSM phone, and a wireless modem. The Cybiko was developed in Moscow by Cybiko Inc, which was founded in 1999 by a young Chinese-Armenian, David Yang. He was already running a successful software company, Abbyy, which develops artificial intelligence products. He came up with the Cybiko when stuck in hospital, he says, \"and for the first time in my life, I had nothing to do.\" Yang researched the idea in six countries including the UK. \"Originally, we were targeting people about 20-30 years old,\" Yang says, \"but we found the highest interest was in the 13-17 range. We decided to go for that market because it is huge - 200m kids - and they don't have anything today. I invested my own money, my father invested, my company invested_\" Today, Cybiko Inc also has investment backing from Sun Technology and its subsidiary, Vesta Capital Partners, which are owned mainly by the Khemka family, from India. America Online's AOL Investments is another backer, and AOL will provide Cybiko with access to its proprietary instant messaging systems. With Cybiko computers being made in Taiwan for the US market, the Russian company is already operating globally, though the software and hardware development is still done in Moscow. The Cybiko is now spreading across the US like influenza. Launched in April,\"full-scale commercial sales\" began in September with a shipment of 42,000 units. That has now climbed to 500,000. The growth pattern follows from the Cybiko's limited range, which in the US is only 50-100m indoors, and 100-200m out of doors. If you have the only Cybiko for miles around, its uses are limited. However, once a few people have them, there is a strong incentive for their friends to get them as well. And as with mobile phones, once critical mass is reached, almost everyone has to have one. The free chat facilities and continuous supply of free games could make the Cybiko a \"must have\" accessory for teenagers in many schools. Better still, the Cybiko also has the ability to \"hop\" signals. Two Cybiko owners can thus communicate via a series of intermediate machines, owned by other people, in a peer-to-peer network. Yang says: \"It will be able to go over up to 10 hops. In big markets, we already have enough density to cover the whole of Manhattan.\" In Europe, things should be better still. Yang says the European system will use a different radio frequency, and local laws allow more power. This will give Cybikos a range of up to 1km outdoors. \"For the adult market, we have different usage scenarios,\" he says. The Cybiko already synchronises with Microsoft Outlook 2000, and the new hardware will be more like an organiser than a games machine. \"And,\" says Yang, \"not only will we provide Cybiko computers, we will also provide cartridges for Palms and PocketPCs like the [Compaq] iPaq.\" Rival devices will thus be absorbed into Cybiko networks. Cybiko Inc also offers \"a wireless internet gateway to connect [handhelds] to the local network in your office,\" he says. \"When you are walking across the car park, or going up in the elevator, you will already be reading your email and checking your messages.\" The CyWIG software - which is free and runs on a PC - is also being tested in shopping malls in America. (See www.cybiko.com/download/application/cwig.asp). The fact that Cybiko communications are free is a big incentive for companies to use the system. Yang says people don't want to pay $30 or $40 a month to a mobile phone or pager company for connectivity in their own homes and offices. Of course, many companies are already planning to install systems that perform the same functions as the Cybiko, using Bluetooth and standard Wi-Fi wireless networking (see www.wi-fi.org). Yang says: \"The second generation Cybiko will be Bluetooth-compatible, but Bluetooth has several disadvantages for us: the range is only 10m, and it does not do peer-to-peer networking.\" Basically, he thinks Bluetooth devices will add to the appeal of Cybiko networks, not replace them. Wi-Fi wireless networking offers more serious competition but Yang says it has the disadvantage of requiring a base station. Also, wireless networking with handheld computers such as Palms and PocketPCs is more expensive than with Cybiko's proprietary system, which is already available in a device that costs less than $100. Yang says Cybiko Inc considered using an existing operating system before writing its own. However, Palm OS was not up to the job, which required multi-tasking and multi-processing, while Microsoft's Windows CE, used in PocketPCs, needed too much expensive memory. Cybiko's operating system has a 30K core and the whole thing only takes up 70K. Bluetooth is the agreed standard for personal area networking: it is expected to become ubiquitous once it has been reduced to a single cheap chip and the software drivers are included in things like Windows. Wi-Fi is the agreed standard for wireless local area networks, and for connecting PCs and handhelds to internet networks: it could become ubiquitous by the same route. But the Cybiko is hard to resist, and at the price, it should sell by the shed-load. Whether the system will still be around in 10 years is another matter, but it will be fun while it lasts.",

They feed voraciously on their photosynthesising cousins the phytoplankton that float in almost every body of natural water, much as cows and sheep munch on juicy blades of grass and dandelions. Now, Georg Pohnert at the Max Planck Institute of Chemical Ecology in Jena, Germany, has discovered that phytoplankton, like many of their very distant relatives on dry land, can hit back with chemical weapons when attacked. </p> <p>Previous researchers had discovered that the diatom Thalassiosira rotula - a type of single-celled algae and one of the many types of phytoplankton - produce the toxic aldehydes decadienal and decatrienal. These molecules are more complex versions of the all-preserving compound formaldehyde used by the artist Damien Hirst to pickle his sheep and cow's heads. The algal aldehydes seem to prevent the eggs of copepods, tiny crustaceans of which there are more than 14,000 known species, from hatching successfully. Copepods might find algae a rather tasty meal full of nutritional value but they usually have little success in attempts to graze on it simply because of the presence of these potent aldehyde toxins. Pohnert has now discovered that the use of toxic aldehydes is a far more widespread means of protection against being eaten, among the diatoms, than previously thought. </p> <p>Diatoms such as thalassiosira are small, single-celled algae belonging to one special group with silica cell walls, he explains. \"They are among the most important carbon dioxide fixing plants.\" He has found that several such algae produce not only decadienal and decatrienal, but a whole range of related chemical weapons, in a molecular call to arms against physical attack. These compounds block the onslaught of the amphipodae, for instance. These are another kind of tiny crustacean of which there are tens of thousands of different unnamed species. The aldehydes and their chemical cousins stop amphipodae in their tracks. They can also help the algae ward off attempted invasion by parasitic fungi. Pohnert reveals in a recent issue of the journal Angewandte Chemie, that none of the defensive sub stances are present inside healthy diatoms. They only appear at the time of attack. Within seconds of being wounded by an alien organism, these chemical weapons pour out and destroy the invaders. </p> <p>To help find out how the diatoms make these chemical weapons so quickly Pohnert swapped the normal hydrogen atoms in various nutrients with \"heavy\" hydrogen - deuterium. This acts as a kind of marker. The diatoms were then \"fed\" in his fish tank individual nutrients labelled with heavy hydrogen. Pohnert could then use mass spectrometry, which basically \"weighs\" the nutrient molecules, to spot which was used to make the toxic aldehydes. It turns out that long chain-like fatty acid molecules provide the starting materials for the diatom's bank of chemical weapons. The diatom's enzymes can transform these fatty acid chains very rapidly into its weapons of defence. The diatom's aldehydes are well trained on their target of zooplankton. The latest evidence from Pohnert's laboratory hints that the zooplankton might be their own worst enemy. They harbour in their guts the chemical trigger that ultimately stimulates the diatoms to release their battery of weapons against them. By only making its chemical weapons in times of trouble, the diatom not only saves energy and resources but also avoids the risk of poisoning itself by carrying an active arsenal inside it. When it is in no danger, the fatty acids are simply used as food and converted into its cellular machinery or used as an energy source. </p> <p>But, the instant an enemy arrives on the scene, the diatom can set in motion its rapid response. Plankton are right at the bottom of the oceanic food chain so play a critical role in the ecology of the seas, explains Pohnert. \"Research into the chemical defence mechanisms of plankton is still in its infancy but nevertheless it is important in order for us to gain a better understanding of the complex processes in marine habitats,\" he explains. </p> <p>Pohnert's research could ultimately have practical ecological applications. His team is studying the molecular marvels of various other algae, such as the tropical green species Caulerpa taxifolia. This alga was accidentally introduced into the Mediterranean Sea several years ago and is rapidly colonising the waters. </p> <p>Figuring out what makes this and other algae so successful might lead to ways to eradicate them from such non-native habitats. \"We are trying to understand the defence of Caulerpa taxifolia from a mechanistic perspective,\" Pohnert said. </p> <p>\"This is done with a focus on the interaction of caulerpa with its predators such as sea slugs.\" He suggests that by identifying the way the ecosystem works at the molecular level one could look for predators of the algae that might be used to control it.</p>",

Pohnert's research could ultimately have practical ecological applications. His team is studying the molecular marvels of various other algae, such as the tropical green species Caulerpa taxifolia. This alga was accidentally introduced into the Mediterranean Sea several years ago and is rapidly colonising the waters. Figuring out what makes this and other algae so successful might lead to ways to eradicate them from such non-native habitats. \"We are trying to understand the defence of Caulerpa taxifolia from a mechanistic perspective,\" Pohnert said. \"This is done with a focus on the interaction of caulerpa with its predators such as sea slugs.\" He suggests that by identifying the way the ecosystem works at the molecular level one could look for predators of the algae that might be used to control it.",

How can that be?'\" </p> <p>As victory speeches go, that one takes some topping though Chapple, the Alex Ferguson of non-league football, may have outdone it after the Staines game. </p> <p>Chapple is seeking an eighth league scalp at Ashton Gate, having claimed his first as Woking boss in 1991, when Tim Buzaglo scored a hat-trick in a 4-2 win at West Brom. Kingstonian have not lost a Trophy game for almost three years and have reached the fourth round of the Cup for the first time; they had not been in the third before. Yet, even allowing for kidology, Chapple sounds genuinely gloomy about their chances. </p> <p>Hearing that the Bristol City manager Danny Wilson had left at half-time on Monday, he said: \"I'm not surprised. I expect Danny went back down the motorway thinking that his lads might as well play in whites on Saturday cos, if we play like that again, they're likely to run up a cricket score. They'll declare at half-time.\" </p> <p>Chapple has dreamed not just of beating league opposition but of joining them, coming closest with a Conference runners-up spot at Woking in 1995. Although his magic had an immediate effect when he brought Kingstonian into the Conference as Ryman League champions in his first season, 1997-98, and to fifth position last season, they are now flailing in the bottom three, having failed to record a league win since November. </p> <p>Chapple says: \"We can't play at home; we've been useless. So we've certainly got a better chance of beating Bristol at their place, though for me, the FA Cup is the least of our priorities. The Conference is the main one, followed by the FA Trophy.\" </p> <p>Kingstonian have managed only two Conference home wins, the last in October against Southport. And, if they beat Bristol City and draw Premiership opposition at home in the fifth round, Chapple will push to switch the tie away to raise money to strengthen his squad. They are not only lacking in numbers but injuries have forced them to use six goalkeepers this season. </p> <p>Chapple recently completed a brilliant piece of business by signing the 22-year-old striker Ian Duerden, knocking Doncaster Rovers down from \u00a310,000 to nothing. Shuffling from foot to foot like Del Boy, he explained: \"I was a bit cagey there. I waited until the price went down to \u00a35,000 then, knowing Doncaster had a few wage bills, waited a bit longer until they agreed to a free with them retaining some sell-on rights. </p> <p>\"I'm delighted to have him because he can play a bit and hold things up.

Embroiled in the Watergate scandal, he had no one left to turn to. The meeting resulted in Nixon's resignation. Russell Lees's clever, often funny, play condenses their conference to 90 minutes of frantic self-analysis, during which Nixon and Kissinger try to find a way of vouchsafing a respectable place in history. </p> <p>As well as bearing an uncanny resemblance to their characters, both actors give a masterful display of bravado and nervous wit. One moment, Keith Jochim's Nixon is all big mouth and blubber, strutting the stage, delivering bolshie one-liners (\"I appeal to the Richard Nixon in everybody\"); the next, he's lumbering like a lost boy, clumsy and round-shouldered in defeat. </p> <p>Tim Donohue as Kissinger, the German Jewish immigrant, is equally captivating, and his deliberate pronunciation means that his every sentence sounds at best like moralising, and at worst like a condemnation of the president. Yet his ponderous demeanour and fastidiousness with words are the perfect foil to the president's strident slang. Not only that, Kissinger cannot afford to tarnish his reputation if he is to retain his post under the incoming president, Gerald Ford, and Donohue's delivery weighs every word in terms of the damage it might do. </p> <p>Although a political play about power and vulnerability could be rather static with the loaded dialogue and a cast of only two, Nixon's Nixon is saved by the quality of the writing and acting, and by an oft-repeated and wonderful device by means of which the two politicians impersonate the great leaders they have had successful dealings with. Jochim's Nixon is brilliant playing the saggy jowls and seriousness of Brezhnev, while Donohue's Kissinger (minus the Groucho Marx glasses) plays Chairman Mao \"being inscrutable all over the place\". Nixon then does a death-defying Napoleon, and even considers taking on the Pope. </p> <p>Of course, this admiration for great leaders (a kind of hubris by proxy) returns to his own failings (and the despairing acknowledgment of the hundreds of thousands killed in Vietnam and Cambodia under his presidency). As the evening advances, and the brandy recedes, Nixon finally accepts that his last heroic gesture will be to do the honourable thing. </p> <p>\u0095 Until Saturday. Box office: 0161-876 2000.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Richard Nixon, the beleaguered president of the United States, called his right-hand man, secretary of state Henry Kissinger, to the White House's Lincoln Sitting Room on the evening of August 7, 1974, it was with some desperation. Embroiled in the Watergate scandal, he had no one left to turn to. The meeting resulted in Nixon's resignation. Russell Lees's clever, often funny, play condenses their conference to 90 minutes of frantic self-analysis, during which Nixon and Kissinger try to find a way of vouchsafing a respectable place in history. As well as bearing an uncanny resemblance to their characters, both actors give a masterful display of bravado and nervous wit. One moment, Keith Jochim's Nixon is all big mouth and blubber, strutting the stage, delivering bolshie one-liners (\"I appeal to the Richard Nixon in everybody\"); the next, he's lumbering like a lost boy, clumsy and round-shouldered in defeat. Tim Donohue as Kissinger, the German Jewish immigrant, is equally captivating, and his deliberate pronunciation means that his every sentence sounds at best like moralising, and at worst like a condemnation of the president. Yet his ponderous demeanour and fastidiousness with words are the perfect foil to the president's strident slang. Not only that, Kissinger cannot afford to tarnish his reputation if he is to retain his post under the incoming president, Gerald Ford, and Donohue's delivery weighs every word in terms of the damage it might do. Although a political play about power and vulnerability could be rather static with the loaded dialogue and a cast of only two, Nixon's Nixon is saved by the quality of the writing and acting, and by an oft-repeated and wonderful device by means of which the two politicians impersonate the great leaders they have had successful dealings with. Jochim's Nixon is brilliant playing the saggy jowls and seriousness of Brezhnev, while Donohue's Kissinger (minus the Groucho Marx glasses) plays Chairman Mao \"being inscrutable all over the place\". Nixon then does a death-defying Napoleon, and even considers taking on the Pope. Of course, this admiration for great leaders (a kind of hubris by proxy) returns to his own failings (and the despairing acknowledgment of the hundreds of thousands killed in Vietnam and Cambodia under his presidency). As the evening advances, and the brandy recedes, Nixon finally accepts that his last heroic gesture will be to do the honourable thing. \u0095 Until Saturday. Box office: 0161-876 2000.",

It could have been dully academic; this was anything but. </p> <p>The pianist, Robert Levin, flung himself into the Emperor Concerto with visible relish. He plays it with a combination of epic opulence and filigree delicacy, avoiding any self-conscious bravura. Equally majestic and refined, Mackerras perfectly judged the work's ebb and flow, moving the adagio on with a gentle tension that avoids the sentiment and religiosity that many interpreters bring to it. </p> <p>The Konzertst\u00fcck was done with equal brilliance, though you gradually became aware of the reasons for its neglect. Soloist and orchestra function as an indivisible unit rather than being forced into opposition. Its dramatic power derives from jolting contrasts of mood, not inner dialogue.

During the opening, in which a series of woodwind and brass solos slowly unfurl over rippling piano arpeggios, the audience sat spellbound. </p> <p>Yet Schumann's Second Symphony was in many respects the high point. Written in 1845, it dramatises the composer's lifelong struggle with depression, passing through intense chromatic anguish before culminating in a mood of rickety optimism. The drier sound of period forces adds to its sombreness. Mackerras's approach is white-hot, unleashing a torrent of dangerous emotion, ambiguous in tone throughout.

It would be pushing it to call Wilde's Gilbertian fantasy with social undercurrents explicitly feminist. But, unlike Orton, Wilde was no misogynist.

This is no wilting violet but a woman determined to get her man. When she announces that the name of Ernest \"produces vibrations\", her whole body shudders with sexual delight and at one point she grabs Mr Worthing and kisses him with undisguised ferocity. But Davis also reminds one of Chekhov's point that, when someone \"spends the least possible number of movements over some definite action, that is grace\". In the rural scenes she combines a fastidious physical economy with a clear-eyed matrimonial certainty.
