      "body": "<p>If the build-up to a big match is a time for frayed nerves and gnawed fingernails, Matt Elliott has had more reasons than most to find himself reduced to a bundle of nerves this week. </p> <p>On Sunday there is every chance the Leicester City captain will hold aloft his first major trophy. But even if Dave Challinor's long throws do not prevent that, the danger is that mother nature will. </p> <p>Like every good punchline, it is all about the delivery. Elliott's wife Cathy is pregnant with their fourth child and, with impeccable timing, the baby is due the same day that the captain should be leading out Leicester City against Tranmere Rovers in the Worthington Cup final. </p> <p>It is a dilemma that has left Elliott not knowing whether to laugh or cry. And it is not beyond the realms of possibility that his only involvement at Wembley will be to send a good-luck message before dashing to a maternity ward. </p> <p>\"I don't know what will happen if I get a late call, that's an awkward one. There's a no-man's-land from 8pm on Saturday to 10am on Sunday when I would be in a quandary about what to do,\" he says. \"I've not really spoken to the gaffer but he knows the situation. </p> <p>\"Ideally she would have had it already and at one stage she was talking about being induced but she decided against that, so now it's a case of playing it by ear and seeing what happens. </p> <p>\"I've been sitting here for the last 10 days thinking it could be any time now. You can't be on tenterhooks all the time but the closer it gets to the due date the likelihood increases.\" </p> <p>Provided he is not brow-mopping beside a hospital bed, Elliott will be assigned to combat Challinor's world-record throw-ins rather than the emergency attacking role which has brought him unexpected success during Leicester's recent injury problems. Despite the prospect of a cricked neck, the 31-year-old is glad to leave goalscoring duties to Emile Heskey and Tony Cottee. </p> <p>\"There are a lot of centre-forwards who go into defence and say it's a piece of cake, but you don't hear too many people saying it the other way around,\" he says. \"It's a totally different game, all the stuff about bending your runs and all that bollocks, it totally loses me.

      "bodyText": "If the build-up to a big match is a time for frayed nerves and gnawed fingernails, Matt Elliott has had more reasons than most to find himself reduced to a bundle of nerves this week. On Sunday there is every chance the Leicester City captain will hold aloft his first major trophy. But even if Dave Challinor's long throws do not prevent that, the danger is that mother nature will. Like every good punchline, it is all about the delivery. Elliott's wife Cathy is pregnant with their fourth child and, with impeccable timing, the baby is due the same day that the captain should be leading out Leicester City against Tranmere Rovers in the Worthington Cup final. It is a dilemma that has left Elliott not knowing whether to laugh or cry. And it is not beyond the realms of possibility that his only involvement at Wembley will be to send a good-luck message before dashing to a maternity ward. \"I don't know what will happen if I get a late call, that's an awkward one. There's a no-man's-land from 8pm on Saturday to 10am on Sunday when I would be in a quandary about what to do,\" he says. \"I've not really spoken to the gaffer but he knows the situation. \"Ideally she would have had it already and at one stage she was talking about being induced but she decided against that, so now it's a case of playing it by ear and seeing what happens. \"I've been sitting here for the last 10 days thinking it could be any time now. You can't be on tenterhooks all the time but the closer it gets to the due date the likelihood increases.\" Provided he is not brow-mopping beside a hospital bed, Elliott will be assigned to combat Challinor's world-record throw-ins rather than the emergency attacking role which has brought him unexpected success during Leicester's recent injury problems. Despite the prospect of a cricked neck, the 31-year-old is glad to leave goalscoring duties to Emile Heskey and Tony Cottee. \"There are a lot of centre-forwards who go into defence and say it's a piece of cake, but you don't hear too many people saying it the other way around,\" he says. \"It's a totally different game, all the stuff about bending your runs and all that bollocks, it totally loses me. I just try to make a nuisance of myself. \"But it's better for the side if I'm in defence. If I'm up front it just shows we have problems in the squad.\" Although he is too diplomatic to say as much, victory would also be one in the eye for the detractors whose sneering derision would have neutrals wondering whether the midlands club had changed their name to Leicester-nil. Chelsea's chairman Ken Bates and the Arsenal manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger can count themselves honorary members of the Leicester-baiting union, and Aston Villa's manager John Gregory applied for membership by expressing the sardonic wish that \"they would actually cross the halfway line\" for the second leg of their semi-final.

It took me quite a while to get Josephine to say what had happened. She is the 18-year-old daughter of my domestic servant here in Johannesburg. Josephine, like her two sisters, is a boarder at a school near Pietersburg, 350 kilometres away. In the school holidays the three girls come and stay with their mother, Doris, who lives in a cottage in my garden - I had waved them off back to school only a few weeks before, Josephine, the eldest, shepherding her smaller sisters. </p> <p>Josephine had left her school to visit cousins in the area over the weekend and, late on the Sunday, had got a taxi back to the school. The driver had dropped his other two passengers and then driven Josephine to his house in a nearby township where he had overpowered and raped her. He had then locked her in a back room, told her that he would keep her there for his pleasure for a month, and then kill her. After that he had gone off to a shebeen, saying he might bring back some of his friends later that night to 'have some fun' with her too.</p> <p> Josephine had managed to attract the attention of two small boys in the street and they had helped her escape. She had been back at school for a day but all she could do was cry, she said. I told her I would send her mother to fetch her right away. Doris was almost hysterical when she heard the news but I bundled her into a taxi and told her to hurry. </p> <p>I rang my friend Brian who runs an epidemiological unit mainly concerned with HIV/Aids. It'll cost you, he said, but if she can get AZT and 3TC in the first 12 hours you can cut the Aids risk by 80 per cent. Brian has twice had to apply such emergency treatment to nurses working in his unit after they pricked themselves with needles used to draw blood from the HIV positive prostitutes who are the central figures in his unit's attempt to control the scourge. I explained that it was already more than 24 hours since Josephine had been raped and that 36 hours would probably have elapsed before she arrived. It might still be worth a try, he said, but the antibodies in her blood would be replicating at a terrifying rate by now. </p> <p>When Josephine arrived I rushed her to a top specialist - a calm Englishman who'd been out here for 18 years. 'I can't do without the drama, the dynamism of being here,' he explained almost apologetically when I asked what a man of his eminence was doing in a crowded, chaotic hospital. He was a keen Chelsea supporter and in between carrying out the tests on Josephine he and I chatted about the great days of Charlie Cooke, David Webb and Peter Osgood. </p> <p>He told me it was already too late to try AZT and 3TC on Josephine but he was cautiously hopeful. 'To get Aids there has to be mixing of blood, which means there has to be a break in the skin or an open sore due to some other sexually transmitted disease. Chances are that the taxi-driver is a sexually reckless fellow and has at least one of these STDs, so Josephine's chances of syphilis and gonorrhoea are high but I can deal with that,' he explained. 'The key question is whether he was so rough while he was raping her that he broke her skin. It's because rape is so traumatic that it so often results in Aids transmission. Especially gang rape, of course, which is almost bound to do it.' That Josephine escaped before the collective 'fun' began had, I now realised, been crucial. </p> <p>After examining Josephine, the specialist told me he could find no break in the skin but he wouldn't have the results of the tests for another six weeks. 'In any case,' he pointed out, 'at least 20 per cent of all black 18-year-old girls are HIV positive already and that figure is rising rapidly towards 30 per cent. She could have been HIV positive before the attack.' I told him I didn't think so: I have lectured Josephine endlessly on the perils of Aids since she was 15, and she is a religious girl. Josephine stayed with us for a week but, despite my efforts, would not talk to the rape counsellor I sent her to. </p> <p>Jo had told the police about the rape. She had given them the driver's name and address, and there was even a corroborating witness who knew about other rapes he'd carried out. Josephine remained nervous: the man had told her that he'd kill her if the case ever came to the attention of the police. I phoned several times but they never seemed to know anything about it and there was a lot of fruitless hunting around for a case number. The taxi driver was seen walking around as if nothing had happened. Clearly nothing would be done. Jo recovered bit by bit. Then, at last, test results came through: HIV negative, praise the Lord. With many misgivings she returned to school. </p> <p>A few days later I looked at my phone bill and realised something was wrong. It was enormously high and I didn't recognise some of the numbers at all. I left the print-out in the kitchen and next morning Doris's manner told me everything I needed to know. We all make mistakes, she said with a grin. We learn only from our mistakes. The really big mistake, I said, is that you've been stealing from me. Over half this phone bill is yours and you've been coming into the house specially to make calls, many of them very long distance and for half an hour at a time.</p> <p> I told you the alarm code of the house and you've been coming in when I was away and on days when you weren't working in the house. You have systematically lied to me and cheated me. At a time when I was doing everything I could, paying for Josephine's schooling, lending you money, spending money on the Aids doctor, the lot. How long has this been going on? It's just this month, she said, crying now. Sometimes I get lonely in the house and want to chat to my friends so I call them. </p> <p>I go and check. It's actually been going on for many months, the amount creeping up all the time. Doris obviously thought I never checked a bill and for a long time she was right. I call her in furiously. I could sack you for this, I say. I told you when I first employed you, I have to trust someone who works in my house, that's the only rule. You'll never be happy again with me now, she wept, you'd better sack me. </p> <p>In the end I say: look, the deal is this. I won't sack you and you can stay if you want. But the reason I do this is for your daughters, especially Jo. You should beat me, Doris says. You can beat me all afternoon, I will deserve it. I don't want to beat you, I tell her. It's not about beating, it's about trust. It takes time to rebuild trust. I change the alarm code, keep it secret, make her pay for the last month's calls. It's all very difficult and sullen for a while. </p> <p>Jo rings again, an incoherent, frantic message on the answering-machine. As so often with phone calls from Africans made from caf\u00e9s or friends' houses, there were loud background voices, slamming doors and much general clatter, but I half-imagined that I heard the phrase 'raped again'. That couldn't be right. Then Doris comes tearing in, eyes wild, getting ready to scream.</p> <p> It was right. In South Africa, the rape capital of the world, the odds were in favour of its being right. They reckon that only in 1 in 20 rapes gets reported but even so 131 are reported every day, one every 11 minutes. If you believe the 1-in-20 thing then it's one every 33 seconds. It's quite possible: many African men still believe (and will even tell you) that it is their right to have their way with any woman they want, whenever they want. </p> <p>So we had to go through the whole ghastly thing over again. Jo came down to Jo'burg, this time so traumatised that she couldn't speak about it to her mother or me for several days. There'd been this man - the husband/boyfriend of a teacher from another school who stayed near where Jo lived. He was a big strong man and he 'was 'painted silver around his waist'. He'd begun to tell Jo he loved her; she was alarmed, and told his wife. In the end the man had come to her and told her she already owed him her life, not just because she'd caused so much trouble between him and his wife, but because he'd had to protect her from his wife's wrath. </p> <p>Anyway, whatever the bullshit, he'd raped her. We told the police, though without much hope. More than 1,300 policemen have been killed in South Africa since 1994; the court system isn't working; criminal justice is a mess; and rape an epidemic. The officers who called dutifully took notes but you got the feeling that one more rape victim wasn't too big a deal. </p> <p>This time I phoned the Aids doctor but didn't go myself. Maybe because it all seemed a bit more routine. In any case, Jo and her mum went without me. It turned out that the test would be far quicker this time, thanks to whatever tests were still relevant from the first occasion. Within five days the doctor phoned me: 'Well,' he said. 'I have the test results. Jo is HIV negative.' </p> <p>I nearly died twice over before he got to the negative. I phoned Doris immediately. She virtually swooned away. I saw Jo, she rushed to me, clung to me with big hugs, told me that I was the only man she knew who wasn't a bastard. I tried to work on that. Look, there are a lot of nice men out there, don't let this thing spoil your life. Only white men are nice, she said. Or some of them. Not all that many, I said. </p> <p>I was walking on the slopes of Table Mountain that weekend when the call came through on my cell phone: there'd been another attempt to rape Jo. A neighbour phoned. An intruder had unscrewed the handle of the cottage door and let himself in. Doris and her boyfriend Ernest had been asleep in the double bed and Jo had been stretched out on a mat in the passage. First thing she'd known the man was pulling off her pants and trying to lie on top of her. She screamed, Doris woke up and pressed the remote-control button which brings armed men running. They were there within a minute but the man was gone. Jo had no sight of him, just a torchlight in her face. </p> <p>Back in Jo'burg, I sat Jo down. I've installed all manner of extra security, I pointed out: locks here, bolts there, gates padlocked. And whoever it was never realised that your mother had a remote control for the alarm and could bring armed men running like that. No one's going to try it again. You'll be safe. But are you telling me the truth? Was this the man who raped you in Pietersburg following you down here? No, she said. So did she have a jilted boyfriend somewhere in the background? No. </p> <p>The point is this, I said. No one's ever tried to break into my house: it has a big notice on it saying Instant Armed Response. But people who do want to break in do so because they want to steal, and because they want to steal they try to break into the main house, not the servants' quarters. But this guy broke in to rape you. The odds against this are millions to one and the odds against it happening just after you've been raped up in Pietersburg are billions to one. So what on earth is going on? I don't know, she said, I only saw the torch in my face. I asked her mother. I don't know, she said, I can't understand it, something's wrong, I agree with you. But she had no more light to shed. </p> <p>Jo was so scared of being on her own now that she went everywhere with her mother. She couldn't bear to be in the cottage on her own, a fact I cursed, for I had wanted, above all, for her to feel that this one place, at least, was safe for her. I decided she'd better come and work in my office. It was a perfect solution. Connie, my assistant, made a big fuss of her, introduced her to computers, showed her how to e-mail and fax, how to pull things off the Internet. Jo, a country girl with poor English who'd never seen a modern office, was thrilled, couldn't wait each day to go to work - and gradually she became useful, a real help. </p> <p>She didn't want to go back to school - she was scared the rapists would kill her. It was impossible to have much confidence in the police. In the end she and her mother came up with a solution: they wanted to get the help of Mapogo a Mathamaga ('the colours of the leopard'), the giant vigilante organisation which centres on Pietersburg. </p> <p>Founded by a black businessman, John Magolego, Mapogo now has 35,000 paid up members, 10,000 of them white - it's a booming business. It moves into an area, rounds up criminal suspects, beats the hell out of them, drags them behind vans on rocky roads or dangles them over crocodile-infested rivers and gets the 'truth' out of them. It doesn't bother with courts, evidence or the police and it claims remarkable success. Once it moves into an area the crime rate falls to zero. Jo and her mum had heard all about Mapogo. So now they wanted me to phone John Magolego. </p> <p>I don't approve of vigilantes, I said. I know the police and the courts are hopeless but once you start with vigilantes where does it stop? Some of the people they beat up - and kill - are quite innocent. What if the taxi driver who raped Jo is himself a Mapogo member? Doris just looked straight through this. Jo must be safe, she said. Here is the number, please phone him. The assumption being that any black man will always take more notice if it's a white man who calls. </p> <p>John Magolego, it turned out, was a very calm, pleasant-sounding and well-spoken man. But this is terrible, he said. Raped twice? Of course we will deal with this. She has the names? Good. She must contact my man in Pietersburg and join Mapogo. He gave me the numbers and explained that the Mapogo office was next to a bakery in a township and one of the bakery staff had to run and summon the Mapogo officer to the phone. The first few times he wasn't there so I rang Magolego again. 'That is not very good,' he said carefully. 'But we have been having a big rally - many thousands came to celebrate our anniversary. I saw our officer there. He must have stayed over. By tomorrow he will be back and I can promise he will deal with your problem.' </p> <p>Which was just what happened. It will cost you money, the man said in English, and then broke into Afrikaans. After a while I handed the phone over to Doris. She spoke for a while in Sepedi and then put the phone down. You must borrow me 730 rands (\u00a373) she said: 165 rands to join, 50 rands monthly subscription, 15 rands for the Mapogo sticker with the two leopard heads and a 500-rand fine for not having joined Mapogo before. I'm not paying for any of that, I said, you'll have to borrow from your friends. </p> <p>My daughter must be safe, she said. Good God, I want her to be safe too, I said, but I don't approve of vigilantes. Magolego is a big man, she said, he can make her safe. Well don't ask me for money, I said. This could well be tantamount to taking out a contract on these two guys. Do you want them to live? Doris asked. Not especially, I said. But you're a Christian, Doris, you go to church every morning. God does not want them to live, she said. </p> <p>Doris disappeared for a while over the weekend. On Monday she said, you must borrow me five hundred rands: I borrow the money for Mapogo from my friends in Alexandra but now I must pay them back. She knew I knew that her friends there lived in shacks. The whole thing was simple and circular, a nonsense to cater for white foolishness. She was full of protestations of gratitude as I counted the money out but the truth was that I had been pulled more and more into her world and she was calling the shots. </p> <p>We're waiting to hear from Jo but I realise that I am quite fatalistic about whatever Mapogo does. I don't really feel differently from Doris about those two guys. If they are removed from the scene many more girls will be safe, and if they just get the shit beaten out of them they're lucky. More troubling is the possibility that there's a whole lot going on here that I'm not being told - the usual white dilemma, the fear of being made a fool of.</p> <p> The talk I'd given Jo about trust and telling the truth was pretty much the same one I'd given Doris. And Doris had deceived me about the phone all the time I was helping her. For all I knew Jo was still holding out on me about the intruder. Probably Doris's story about borrowing R730 in Alexandra was nonsense too; probably what I'd given her had been paid directly to Mapogo. There was no way of knowing for sure. </p> <p><strong>Technology</strong></p> <p>In my office in Johannesburg we always seem to have a lot of computer trouble. To sort it out I had inherited from my predecessor a computer troubleshooter called Villiers Strydom, a tall, slim, mustachioed Afrikaner. Villiers, who appeared to live by mobile phone (it was never switched off and you never got him any other way), was famous with the secretaries for promising to come to fix the latest glitch and not quite managing to get there.</p> <p> The resulting aggravation would produce earnest discussions as to whether we shouldn't dispense with his services and find someone else. But we never did. Villiers did seem very good at his work; and he always arrived in the end, even if not when promised, and he was cheap. He was nice, too: soft, gentle, good-humoured and nothing like the stereotypical bull-of-the-pampas Afrikaner rugger bugger that his name led you to expect. In fact, Villiers greatly disliked that sort of person: he was a passionate citizen of the new South Africa - not just non-racist but strongly anti-racist, anti-sexist and the rest of it. </p> <p>When he talked of the things he so passionately disliked in traditional Afrikanerdom - the straitlacedness, the crude bully-boy racism, the Calvinist parochialism - he could get quite upset, and at those times he seemed quite frail: tears would well in his eyes, his voice would tremble and you would notice again how slender his tall, thirty-something frame was.</p> <p> What turned Villiers on was hi-tech gizmos, the new, the laid-back. Like not a few of his peers, he was a natural Californian born of Boers. He was also, we soon realised, gay. After a while he introduced a young friend, Arthur, who came around with him and learnt his trade, devotedly watching Villiers as he fixed our errant Windows, e-mail and printers. </p> <p>One day Villiers let us down even more badly than usual and I was getting ready to fire him when I ran into my predecessor. You can't do that, he said. Villiers really likes all the people in your office. He says they're the nicest people he's ever worked with, he's always going on about it, it would break his heart. Besides, he's HIV positive. He's being very brave about it, going to a gym, keeping super-fit. He told me all that one day when he was working after hours. He was tired and because of that got rather tearful and it sort of came out. He says he knows the normal HIV-Aids cycle is only six years long but he's determined to extend his life by achieving and maintaining perfect health. But you can't let him know you know.</p> <p> Not long after that we had another breakdown. 'My fucking machine has got cyber-Aids,' Helen, one of our secretaries, said in exasperation. After that I had to take her into the secret, too, so that she didn't say something similar in front of Villiers. Soon everyone in the office knew, but no one said a word. All it meant was that Villiers got a lot more sympathetic mothering, which seemed to bemuse and delight him. </p> <p>Another day he came in to install some new programs, looking dreadful. His brother had been shot dead over the weekend, he said, and the whole family was in uproar, his mother in hysterics and everyone leaning on him for support as the remaining man in the family. He wept openly over the Windows 98 and Word 97 and seemed about to snap. </p> <p>Next week it was even worse. The bloody police, he said, have got this crazy idea that my sister-in-law shot him. It was bad enough for her already, having her husband mown down, but now they're accusing her, pushing her around, forcing her to make statements. Now she, too, is in hysterics. </p> <p>Things went on in this way for a week or so until Villiers looked as if he was going to burst. He fled to lie on a beach with Arthur somewhere up the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal. I spoke to him there on his mobile phone. He was chortling with the sheer pleasure of getting away. When he was back I asked him about his sister-in-law. Oh, that's sort of settled down, he said. The police have left her alone so she's calmer now. We're all calmer now. Anyway, I reckon maybe she did shoot him. My brother was a difficult guy, she might have had her reasons. He winked. </p> <p>Not long after that, Villiers was upgrading my colleague Susan's machine when she saw his T-shirt was bulging at the back. What's that, she asked. Villiers pulled out a giant gun, the sort of Magnum you see in the movies. He was really serious about it all, taking shooting classes, learning how to be fast on the draw, the lot. In Dirty Harry, Villiers said, Clint Eastwood says this is the most powerful handgun in the world so I reckon, OK, they got my brother but they're sure as hell not getting me. </p> <p>But we thought your sister-in-law did it, we said. Maybe she did, he said. Quite possibly. But anyway they're not getting me. I always keep it loaded. No use having it otherwise, but don't worry, there's a safety catch. This seemed fair enough and we all got used to Villiers moving about the office all rodded up. </p> <p>Then we got a note saying that Villiers's one-man show was now to be called Monet Systems. I just like the name, sort of French, was all he would say. A little while later he announced that he was changing his name to Lanchester Monet. English or French? we asked. Sort of both, he said. I just don't like being an Afrikaner so I've decided to stop being one. After a while we got his new business card: Lanchester Jean-Paul Monet. You're getting more French, we said, but you can't speak French. I'm working on it, he said: the key lifestyle decision is the name change. You have to call me 'Lanchester' now. </p> <p>What with work, Arthur, the gym, the shooting classes and French lessons Lanchester was now frantically busy. We saw him less and less. Our computers were held together with rubber bands, literally. The fax machine would only work if you had it jammed against the wall in a certain position and the printers wouldn't work unless you unplugged and replugged them at each go. Finally, we called in someone else. Every now and again we get an e-mail from Villiers/Lanchester, but we just say the computers are working OK. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/lrb/articles/0,6109,140305,00.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Read on: a road accident, a boy called Hitler and a blessing in interesting times</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The reality of rape The voice on the phone was terrified and tearful. 'I'm in such trouble, such trouble.' It took me quite a while to get Josephine to say what had happened. She is the 18-year-old daughter of my domestic servant here in Johannesburg. Josephine, like her two sisters, is a boarder at a school near Pietersburg, 350 kilometres away. In the school holidays the three girls come and stay with their mother, Doris, who lives in a cottage in my garden - I had waved them off back to school only a few weeks before, Josephine, the eldest, shepherding her smaller sisters. Josephine had left her school to visit cousins in the area over the weekend and, late on the Sunday, had got a taxi back to the school. The driver had dropped his other two passengers and then driven Josephine to his house in a nearby township where he had overpowered and raped her. He had then locked her in a back room, told her that he would keep her there for his pleasure for a month, and then kill her. After that he had gone off to a shebeen, saying he might bring back some of his friends later that night to 'have some fun' with her too. Josephine had managed to attract the attention of two small boys in the street and they had helped her escape. She had been back at school for a day but all she could do was cry, she said. I told her I would send her mother to fetch her right away. Doris was almost hysterical when she heard the news but I bundled her into a taxi and told her to hurry. I rang my friend Brian who runs an epidemiological unit mainly concerned with HIV/Aids. It'll cost you, he said, but if she can get AZT and 3TC in the first 12 hours you can cut the Aids risk by 80 per cent. Brian has twice had to apply such emergency treatment to nurses working in his unit after they pricked themselves with needles used to draw blood from the HIV positive prostitutes who are the central figures in his unit's attempt to control the scourge. I explained that it was already more than 24 hours since Josephine had been raped and that 36 hours would probably have elapsed before she arrived. It might still be worth a try, he said, but the antibodies in her blood would be replicating at a terrifying rate by now. When Josephine arrived I rushed her to a top specialist - a calm Englishman who'd been out here for 18 years. 'I can't do without the drama, the dynamism of being here,' he explained almost apologetically when I asked what a man of his eminence was doing in a crowded, chaotic hospital. He was a keen Chelsea supporter and in between carrying out the tests on Josephine he and I chatted about the great days of Charlie Cooke, David Webb and Peter Osgood. He told me it was already too late to try AZT and 3TC on Josephine but he was cautiously hopeful.

Look, there are a lot of nice men out there, don't let this thing spoil your life. Only white men are nice, she said. Or some of them. Not all that many, I said. I was walking on the slopes of Table Mountain that weekend when the call came through on my cell phone: there'd been another attempt to rape Jo. A neighbour phoned. An intruder had unscrewed the handle of the cottage door and let himself in. Doris and her boyfriend Ernest had been asleep in the double bed and Jo had been stretched out on a mat in the passage. First thing she'd known the man was pulling off her pants and trying to lie on top of her. She screamed, Doris woke up and pressed the remote-control button which brings armed men running. They were there within a minute but the man was gone. Jo had no sight of him, just a torchlight in her face. Back in Jo'burg, I sat Jo down. I've installed all manner of extra security, I pointed out: locks here, bolts there, gates padlocked. And whoever it was never realised that your mother had a remote control for the alarm and could bring armed men running like that. No one's going to try it again. You'll be safe. But are you telling me the truth? Was this the man who raped you in Pietersburg following you down here? No, she said. So did she have a jilted boyfriend somewhere in the background? No. The point is this, I said. No one's ever tried to break into my house: it has a big notice on it saying Instant Armed Response. But people who do want to break in do so because they want to steal, and because they want to steal they try to break into the main house, not the servants' quarters. But this guy broke in to rape you. The odds against this are millions to one and the odds against it happening just after you've been raped up in Pietersburg are billions to one. So what on earth is going on? I don't know, she said, I only saw the torch in my face. I asked her mother. I don't know, she said, I can't understand it, something's wrong, I agree with you. But she had no more light to shed. Jo was so scared of being on her own now that she went everywhere with her mother. She couldn't bear to be in the cottage on her own, a fact I cursed, for I had wanted, above all, for her to feel that this one place, at least, was safe for her. I decided she'd better come and work in my office. It was a perfect solution. Connie, my assistant, made a big fuss of her, introduced her to computers, showed her how to e-mail and fax, how to pull things off the Internet. Jo, a country girl with poor English who'd never seen a modern office, was thrilled, couldn't wait each day to go to work - and gradually she became useful, a real help. She didn't want to go back to school - she was scared the rapists would kill her. It was impossible to have much confidence in the police. In the end she and her mother came up with a solution: they wanted to get the help of Mapogo a Mathamaga ('the colours of the leopard'), the giant vigilante organisation which centres on Pietersburg. Founded by a black businessman, John Magolego, Mapogo now has 35,000 paid up members, 10,000 of them white - it's a booming business. It moves into an area, rounds up criminal suspects, beats the hell out of them, drags them behind vans on rocky roads or dangles them over crocodile-infested rivers and gets the 'truth' out of them. It doesn't bother with courts, evidence or the police and it claims remarkable success. Once it moves into an area the crime rate falls to zero. Jo and her mum had heard all about Mapogo. So now they wanted me to phone John Magolego. I don't approve of vigilantes, I said. I know the police and the courts are hopeless but once you start with vigilantes where does it stop? Some of the people they beat up - and kill - are quite innocent. What if the taxi driver who raped Jo is himself a Mapogo member? Doris just looked straight through this. Jo must be safe, she said. Here is the number, please phone him. The assumption being that any black man will always take more notice if it's a white man who calls. John Magolego, it turned out, was a very calm, pleasant-sounding and well-spoken man. But this is terrible, he said. Raped twice? Of course we will deal with this. She has the names? Good. She must contact my man in Pietersburg and join Mapogo. He gave me the numbers and explained that the Mapogo office was next to a bakery in a township and one of the bakery staff had to run and summon the Mapogo officer to the phone. The first few times he wasn't there so I rang Magolego again. 'That is not very good,' he said carefully. 'But we have been having a big rally - many thousands came to celebrate our anniversary. I saw our officer there. He must have stayed over. By tomorrow he will be back and I can promise he will deal with your problem.' Which was just what happened. It will cost you money, the man said in English, and then broke into Afrikaans. After a while I handed the phone over to Doris. She spoke for a while in Sepedi and then put the phone down. You must borrow me 730 rands (\u00a373) she said: 165 rands to join, 50 rands monthly subscription, 15 rands for the Mapogo sticker with the two leopard heads and a 500-rand fine for not having joined Mapogo before. I'm not paying for any of that, I said, you'll have to borrow from your friends. My daughter must be safe, she said. Good God, I want her to be safe too, I said, but I don't approve of vigilantes. Magolego is a big man, she said, he can make her safe. Well don't ask me for money, I said. This could well be tantamount to taking out a contract on these two guys. Do you want them to live? Doris asked. Not especially, I said. But you're a Christian, Doris, you go to church every morning. God does not want them to live, she said. Doris disappeared for a while over the weekend. On Monday she said, you must borrow me five hundred rands: I borrow the money for Mapogo from my friends in Alexandra but now I must pay them back. She knew I knew that her friends there lived in shacks. The whole thing was simple and circular, a nonsense to cater for white foolishness. She was full of protestations of gratitude as I counted the money out but the truth was that I had been pulled more and more into her world and she was calling the shots. We're waiting to hear from Jo but I realise that I am quite fatalistic about whatever Mapogo does. I don't really feel differently from Doris about those two guys. If they are removed from the scene many more girls will be safe, and if they just get the shit beaten out of them they're lucky. More troubling is the possibility that there's a whole lot going on here that I'm not being told - the usual white dilemma, the fear of being made a fool of. The talk I'd given Jo about trust and telling the truth was pretty much the same one I'd given Doris. And Doris had deceived me about the phone all the time I was helping her. For all I knew Jo was still holding out on me about the intruder. Probably Doris's story about borrowing R730 in Alexandra was nonsense too; probably what I'd given her had been paid directly to Mapogo. There was no way of knowing for sure. Technology In my office in Johannesburg we always seem to have a lot of computer trouble. To sort it out I had inherited from my predecessor a computer troubleshooter called Villiers Strydom, a tall, slim, mustachioed Afrikaner. Villiers, who appeared to live by mobile phone (it was never switched off and you never got him any other way), was famous with the secretaries for promising to come to fix the latest glitch and not quite managing to get there. The resulting aggravation would produce earnest discussions as to whether we shouldn't dispense with his services and find someone else. But we never did. Villiers did seem very good at his work; and he always arrived in the end, even if not when promised, and he was cheap. He was nice, too: soft, gentle, good-humoured and nothing like the stereotypical bull-of-the-pampas Afrikaner rugger bugger that his name led you to expect. In fact, Villiers greatly disliked that sort of person: he was a passionate citizen of the new South Africa - not just non-racist but strongly anti-racist, anti-sexist and the rest of it. When he talked of the things he so passionately disliked in traditional Afrikanerdom - the straitlacedness, the crude bully-boy racism, the Calvinist parochialism - he could get quite upset, and at those times he seemed quite frail: tears would well in his eyes, his voice would tremble and you would notice again how slender his tall, thirty-something frame was. What turned Villiers on was hi-tech gizmos, the new, the laid-back. Like not a few of his peers, he was a natural Californian born of Boers. He was also, we soon realised, gay. After a while he introduced a young friend, Arthur, who came around with him and learnt his trade, devotedly watching Villiers as he fixed our errant Windows, e-mail and printers. One day Villiers let us down even more badly than usual and I was getting ready to fire him when I ran into my predecessor. You can't do that, he said. Villiers really likes all the people in your office. He says they're the nicest people he's ever worked with, he's always going on about it, it would break his heart. Besides, he's HIV positive. He's being very brave about it, going to a gym, keeping super-fit. He told me all that one day when he was working after hours. He was tired and because of that got rather tearful and it sort of came out. He says he knows the normal HIV-Aids cycle is only six years long but he's determined to extend his life by achieving and maintaining perfect health. But you can't let him know you know. Not long after that we had another breakdown. 'My fucking machine has got cyber-Aids,' Helen, one of our secretaries, said in exasperation. After that I had to take her into the secret, too, so that she didn't say something similar in front of Villiers. Soon everyone in the office knew, but no one said a word. All it meant was that Villiers got a lot more sympathetic mothering, which seemed to bemuse and delight him. Another day he came in to install some new programs, looking dreadful. His brother had been shot dead over the weekend, he said, and the whole family was in uproar, his mother in hysterics and everyone leaning on him for support as the remaining man in the family. He wept openly over the Windows 98 and Word 97 and seemed about to snap. Next week it was even worse. The bloody police, he said, have got this crazy idea that my sister-in-law shot him. It was bad enough for her already, having her husband mown down, but now they're accusing her, pushing her around, forcing her to make statements. Now she, too, is in hysterics. Things went on in this way for a week or so until Villiers looked as if he was going to burst. He fled to lie on a beach with Arthur somewhere up the north coast of KwaZulu-Natal. I spoke to him there on his mobile phone. He was chortling with the sheer pleasure of getting away. When he was back I asked him about his sister-in-law. Oh, that's sort of settled down, he said. The police have left her alone so she's calmer now. We're all calmer now. Anyway, I reckon maybe she did shoot him. My brother was a difficult guy, she might have had her reasons. He winked. Not long after that, Villiers was upgrading my colleague Susan's machine when she saw his T-shirt was bulging at the back. What's that, she asked. Villiers pulled out a giant gun, the sort of Magnum you see in the movies. He was really serious about it all, taking shooting classes, learning how to be fast on the draw, the lot. In Dirty Harry, Villiers said, Clint Eastwood says this is the most powerful handgun in the world so I reckon, OK, they got my brother but they're sure as hell not getting me. But we thought your sister-in-law did it, we said. Maybe she did, he said. Quite possibly. But anyway they're not getting me. I always keep it loaded. No use having it otherwise, but don't worry, there's a safety catch. This seemed fair enough and we all got used to Villiers moving about the office all rodded up. Then we got a note saying that Villiers's one-man show was now to be called Monet Systems. I just like the name, sort of French, was all he would say. A little while later he announced that he was changing his name to Lanchester Monet. English or French? we asked. Sort of both, he said. I just don't like being an Afrikaner so I've decided to stop being one. After a while we got his new business card: Lanchester Jean-Paul Monet. You're getting more French, we said, but you can't speak French. I'm working on it, he said: the key lifestyle decision is the name change. You have to call me 'Lanchester' now. What with work, Arthur, the gym, the shooting classes and French lessons Lanchester was now frantically busy. We saw him less and less. Our computers were held together with rubber bands, literally. The fax machine would only work if you had it jammed against the wall in a certain position and the printers wouldn't work unless you unplugged and replugged them at each go. Finally, we called in someone else. Every now and again we get an e-mail from Villiers/Lanchester, but we just say the computers are working OK.

Mr Tumilowcz, 26, had agreed to transport \u00a319,000 worth of heroin from his home in West Lothian to a drop-off at a bar in Aberdeen. He had duly arrived at the bar, and ensconced himself in a corner to await his rendezvous. What he failed to notice, however, was that he had sat down directly beneath a police e-fit poster of a man wanted in connection with a series of flashing incidents in a local park. That in itself didn't necessarily constitute a problem. What did was that by a vicious twist of fate Mr Tumilowicz happened to be the spitting image of the computer-generated picture above him. Whilst he innocently sipped his pint of heavy, suspicious staff, convinced he was the so-called Torry Tickler, contacted the police, who arrived at the bar and began questioning him. Even then he might have got away with it, for it soon became evident that he hadn't been anywhere near Aberdeen at the times of the alleged incidents. Unfortunately, however, his insistence that he wasn't carrying any drugs when police officers hadn't asked him if he was aroused suspicion, and he was duly searched, revealing a bag of what Mr Tumilowicz claimed were \"sweeties\", but closer examination proved to be 58.58mg of heroin with a street-value of \u00a319,000.

      "body": "<p><strong>Victims</strong></p> <p>We were driving in a two-car convoy through the Transkei when the thing you're always being warned about happened. In my rear-view mirror I saw a little girl dash out in front of Carol's white Nissan. The impact of the bumper lifted her briefly into the air before she landed, rolled over and scurried away down the hillside fringed with huts. </p> <p>We stopped - a bad move. There are endless stories of white motorists driving through the Transkei, hitting a child and, when they stop, being set on and sometimes killed by angry mobs. One is always warned not to stop in such an event, the assumption being that the non-existent traffic sense of Transkei peasant children makes such accidents reliably frequent. </p> <p>But we stopped. What else can you do when you've hit a child? Leaving Carol, my 80-year-old mother and my daughter relatively secure in the cars, my son Richard and I plunged down the hill, going from hut to hut asking for the little girl. Directed ever further down we soon found ourselves accompanied - 'surrounded' does more justice to the tenseness of the situation - by a crowd of young men with knobkerries. At length we found the girl.</p> <p> She was eight but looked younger, and was being looked after by an old man who had bandaged her knee. She seemed to be basically all right, but extremely fearful as if waiting to be scolded. When I pressed all the money I had on me into her hand she was evidently amazed. I told the old man that she probably needed to lie down. He nodded and took the child inside. As we headed back uphill our escort of young men melted away. </p> <p>Back at the top two burly Xhosa women had somehow ensconced themselves in the car alongside Carol and my mother, one claiming to be the child's mother, while the other - who was clearly in charge - was introduced as her friend. The mother, showing no sign of wanting to be with her daughter, had despatched a youth to bring her up while she stuck close to the car. Within a minute the little girl was produced. Carol suggested that we take all three of them to the nearest hospital at Mount Frere in case there was an internal injury of some kind. Once we were in the car the mother's friend suggested I give her a lift some two hundred miles in another direction while the mother herself began talking of the taxi fare back home. I said I couldn't help with the lift but would of course pay the taxi fare. </p> <p>Mount Frere hospital lay in a back street thronged with tribesmen and traders. The town itself is as bone-poor as the rest of the Transkei and there'd been a lot of gang violence in the area in previous months, including several good-sized massacres. Carol and Richard said they'd go into the hospital but that I had better stay and guard my mother and daughter. As she left, Carol beckoned me over and to my surprise pulled a tiny revolver out of her shorts. I shouldn't need this in the hospital, she said, but you might need it out here. It's loaded. If there's trouble just keep the trigger pressed and it will keep on firing.</p> <p> I hid the gun down my shorts and pulled my shirt over it to try to disguise the fact that I was armed. My mother and daughter certainly never suspected that I had a gun. An hour later there was still no sign of Carol, the women or the girl and dusk was approaching. We had miles to go on terrible roads on which animals and people were liable to wander heedless of approaching cars. If we didn't leave soon the drive would be impossible. I went inside the hospital to investigate. There were no doctors, no nurses, no one even at reception. The place was filthy, the toilets solid with shit and flies buzzed busily everywhere. It was difficult to imagine that conditions could have been worse than this under any preceding regime. </p> <p>The little girl was stretched out on a bare table staring unseeing at the ceiling - in a trance or in shock. Carol and Richard had tried to persuade the two women attendants present that she needed attention or at least a blanket but had got nowhere: looking around I could see no evidence that the hospital had blankets and sheets. In the end we just left our phone numbers and addresses and gave something like twenty times the taxi fare to the girl's mother and her friend - though we were still unsure as to whether this really was the girl's mother. </p> <p>The following day we went to a police station in KwaZulu-Natal to report the incident. The constable we dealt with clearly had a hangover and expressed incredulity that we thought it worth doing. In the end I took the report form from him and filled it in myself. He filed it with the air of a man throwing away waste paper. The regional administrative centre of the Eastern Cape Government in Kokstad professes itself unable to make contact with the Eastern Cape capital of Bisho, so what chance was there that a report filed in KwaZulu-Natal would somehow get through to the authorities in the Eastern Cape?</p> <p> Moreover, the area where the accident had happened had recently seen a great deal of cattle-rustling as well as political violence: minor road accidents were an irrelevant distraction. Later we phoned the hospital and were told that a doctor had seen the girl and discharged her. The main consequence of the accident was that a couple of hundred extra rands had been injected into the Transkei economy, a sort of tariff which might have been exacted over an incident of any kind. Friends shook their heads: that was the Fourth World, they said; welcome back to the Third. We were treated as if we were the victims of the accident, though it didn't feel like that. The two women, one of whom may have been the girl's mother, had successfully put themselves forward as victims and got the lion's share of the money. The money I had given to the real victim, the little girl, was doubtless confiscated by an adult. Throughout the whole drama she never spoke a word. </p> <p><strong>A boy called Hitler</strong></p> <p>Not long ago I was trying to locate my friend Michael, and phoned his daughter, Annie, who lives at Hillcrest, in the hills outside Durban. It's always just a bit tricky ringing her up, because you never know which of her husbands you might get. The first one was Dave, but a few years after she married him she met Jim. She explained to Dave that she wanted to live with Jim and have babies with him, which Dave said was OK, but he looked sad and said it would make him lonely, so Annie said: 'Well you could stay on if you like.' He did and is very sweet with the kids.</p> <p> Anyway, this time I got neither husband, but a strange male voice which said no, Michael wasn't there, or if he was, he was asleep. Who is that, by the way? I asked. Hitler, the voice said. I was a bit puzzled and rang Michael's great friend, David Cohen. I know, he said, that happened to me too. But I didn't press it. If you're Jewish you don't want to quarrel with someone called Hitler. </p> <p>Hitler, it turned out, was a little Xhosa boy. Africans quite often name children after qualities they like - Beauty, Perfect, Fairness, Golden Miles or Happiness. I've even known a Psychology Ndlovu and an Electricity Bengu. But sometimes they use names of people they think are just generally famous (eg Nelson). Hitler's mother, a peasant woman in the Transkei, had heard that Hitler was a pretty famous man. </p> <p>When her Hitler was eight she had her sixth child and told Hitler that there was just no money or food for him. If you stay here in the Transkei you'll starve, so you'd better go to Durban, she said. It's a huge city. In a place like that there is always bound to be more money and things that come loose so you can take them. Just keep walking north. It'll take you several weeks, but you'll be OK if you keep the sea on your right. </p> <p>Hitler's marathon walk must have been quite something: it would have been testing for a 28-year-old, let alone a boy of eight. How he managed to find food as he walked, I don't know. But one day he reached the big city and became a street child on the Durban beachfront. Unfortunately, there were already many hundreds of other street children there, begging, stealing, mugging and fighting. Once white tramps had slept there but they've mostly gone now, either stabbed or chased away by the kids. </p> <p>The competition is rough and after a while Hitler decided to migrate out of town. He found a shopfront in Hillcrest, where he slept under cardboard and begged for his breakfast. During the day he attended a little village school, then came back and begged for his supper in the evening. He'd been doing this for a year and was 10 years old when Annie, doing her Saturday supermarket shop, bumped into him and said he'd better come home with her. </p> <p>Annie's idea was that Hitler would make a good friend for her own eight-year-old, Ben, and could go to school with him. Everyone told her that street children are ruined by the trauma they've already been through, that they are often on drugs or glue, that they all steal and will probably go on to rape and murder, too. The weight of evidence is heavily on the side of such advice, but Hitler did indeed become Ben's great friend, was utterly delighted to have found a place where you got TLC and square meals, and realised that his mother had been right to kick him out: this was much better than starving in the Transkei. At school he was a bit behind but tried hard. </p> <p>One thing he tried hard at was running, and he soon revealed a great talent, winning just about every event at the school sports day. At which point he was, inevitably, asked if he was any good at rugby. (By this stage he'd had enough ribbing to understand that there was something wrong with his name, and he announced that he would be Timothy from now on.) But no, he'd no idea how to play rugby. He soon did though: was quickly in the school team and before long in the provincial side, which means that he could one day be a prospect for the Springbok team itself.</p> <p> Lately he had found himself on a rugby tour in the Eastern Cape, which gave him a chance to drop off to see his mother back home in the Transkei. She had done the right thing, he reported: life in Durban was something else, which caused her to wonder whether she shouldn't kick another few chickens out of the nest. The last I heard, Timothy, as well as the rugby and keeping Annie and her husbands happy with his homework, had taken up marathon running, at which he was looking distinctly promising. </p> <p><strong>Grace</strong></p> <p>During the 1994 election I went out to a township with a friend who is an extremely literal-minded and evangelical Christian. The township, he explained, was torn between the ANC and Inkatha and their two leaders, Teaspoon Mkhize and Spitfire Dhlamini. At one point in the day I found myself interviewing an ANC warlord while a drugged teenager sat at the door, watching us menacingly, a Kalashnikov across his lap. </p> <p>At day's end I sat down to dinner with my friend and his wife and he said grace. 'Lord,' he said, eyes tight shut, holding each of us by the hand, 'what about that young boy with the AK-47, what of your plans for him? I think about him especially.' When he said grace again at the end of the meal, he simply said: 'Lord, thank you for sending us such a wonderfully interesting country to live in.' </p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books, visit the <a href=\"www.lrb.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">LRB</a>.

Six months later at a cost of nearly \u00a31 million we closed it. Still, nothing ventured, nothing gained - I have no regrets about it because all of us learn most from mistakes!\"",

After working for a number of companies as a designer, she decided to launch her own label's spring/ summer 2000 collection at London Fashion Week last autumn; orders are healthy, the buzz strong and fashion trade bible Women's Wear Daily is tipping her alongside Patty Shelabarger and former Prada menswear designer Neil Barrett as one of this year's Milan-based up-and-comers. </p> <p>Jong's career path has been conventional but fast-track. After graduating in fashion design at the Royal College of Art, she came to Italy in 1992 and built a reputation with her work for major design groups. In 1996, Giorgio Armani personally recruited her as design director for his Le Collezione womenswear line. Having established her international credentials - and an impressive contacts book - she left Armani last year to work on Yulan and maintains her income by working as a freelance consultant to big design houses. Her Yulan collection for spring/summer 2000 is notable for its high standards of craftsmanship. The tailoring and design are based on folding, wrapping and layering, but it is the colour that has drawn the attention of the cognoscenti. Each of the 30 pieces is dyed precisely the same shade of red which, Jong says, is a feat generally regarded as difficult-to-impossible, given the use of different fabrics and textures. </p> <p>Jong is the kind of designer Milan needs in order to maintain its unique tradition of fostering creativity and business nous in tandem. Of the four fashion capitals, this is the one to which graduates have come if they want to pursue directional, creative design and learn to make it sell. London is innovative but so lacking in infrastructure and business support that young designers have to set up their own, small labels, which then suffer from naive management; New York is too corporate and market-led to allow much experiment; Paris is class-bound and hierarchical, which makes it hard for the young to get a foothold. Milan, by contrast, likes to recruit our talent (\"If you're good and a little bit crazy-British, you can get very well rewarded in Italy,\" explains one London designer working here) and though it works people hard, Milan usually trains them well. </p> <p>However, that tradition may be under threat and future graduates could find it hard to follow a career path like Jong's. In the bar of the Principe de Savoia hotel, the international fashion community's preferred Milanese drinking venue, the talk is of economic conditions squeezing out the middle-sized fashion production companies; of northern family-based fashion businesses closing because of new developments in their markets; and, of course, of designers suffering as a result. </p> <p>The problem is the growth of the big fashion conglomerates. Over the past five years, Prada, Gucci Group and the French LVMH have been buying up companies and bringing hard-headed, expansionist policies to the European fashion industry. In Italy, smaller, artisan concerns are finding their prices undercut and their margins undermined by the conglomerates' economies of scale; those looking to cut costs are hampered by Italian employment laws that render it prohibitively expensive to make staff redundant. </p> <p>\"They [the conglomerates] have created a monopoly and there's nothing we can do,\" says Leonardo Baratella, head of LEBA, an independent production company based in Vicenza, near Milan. \"I have always run this company in a flexible way and tried to keep ahead of things, yet I'm now forced to close down.\" </p> <p>Smaller companies suffer as price margins are cut: \"But they cannot afford to close down because to sack a whole factory floor of staff would cost hundreds of millions of lire. If they can't close, they end up with no alternative but to accept decreased prices which pushes them further into difficulties. In the end, they will sell at the first chance to a big company at a reduced price. </p> <p>\"The other day,\" he sighs, \"a machine representative came to show me some new machines. He had seen four companies that day; each had asked if they could sell him their machines, instead of buying them from him.\" </p> <p>Of course, the big companies will argue that they are only bringing modern, globally-oriented business techniques to an old-fashioned market. Some observers would say the smaller companies have let themselves down, with their innate conservatism in business and design. What seems indisputable is that, for the next few years at least, it will become harder for young designers to break through with their own collections. One British woman, who prefers not to be named, tells how last year she left a senior post at one of the biggest Milan houses to design her own collection. After showing it in Paris, she had good reviews and sold it into shops around Europe, but it was never manufactured because her Italian production company could not afford the initial outlay and the fabric supplier could no longer accept deferred payment. She has gone back to consulting for established labels. </p> <p>Mark Strong, a St Martins graduate who's been designing for a company based near Milan for just over a year, is pessimistic. \"It has always been hard for British graduates coming here,\" he says. \"They work you really hard and you usually end up stuck in grotty company flats in small factory towns miles from Milan. A lot of people think that if they make it, they can start their own label, but that seems to be getting harder and just working for the companies is horrible because they're panicking. They are still doing business like they were in the 80s and early 90s, and they know they're getting out of date, but they don't know how to compete. They know they need to take more risks with their design but they can't afford a drop in their old customers while they build up a new base.\" </p> <p>This need for newness with guaranteed public appeal means that for those who can break through, the potential interest and rewards are high - Jong is currently considering offers from several powerful backers who want to launch her internationally. For the less fortunate or gifted however, the future is less bright; right now, it's business as unusual in Milano.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Growing old is neither easy nor graceful. It is particularly angst-ridden if you're in the fashion business, where youthful beauty is prized over everything. At the shows, you see the Milan grans, powdered and buffed and dressed in their \u00a35,000 outfits, and you wonder what possible relevance a wisp of see-through chiffon blouse or a sequined miniskirt can have to their lives. True, they can appreciate these things on an aesthetic level, but how can you get excited about clothes you can't wear? You can't. That's why there is such an outcry when hotpants are revived, or yellow, or sheer. Only a model can look good in those, nary a real woman. And so fashion editors (who are real women, honest) dismiss these trends in their journals and avidly wait for black to come back again. Which, of course, it always does. </p> <p>There is no mystery attached to why the Italians sell such a lot of clothes. Women want to look thinner. Taller. More powerful. Comfy in the daytime and sexy in the evening. And that's what Milan does. That's why, however creative and wonderful London might be, it will never, ever have the clout of Milan because there is only a limited market for flesh-coloured leather corsets and chair covers that turn into dresses. </p> <p>It was a vibrant season, literally. Not only was colour everywhere but pattern, too. Geometric prints zigzagged their way down the catwalk so loudly that donning pretentious black shades was a sensible idea. Clothes that give you a headache? Not instantly desirable, but wait. </p> <p>Let's start with the most influential designers, since Milan is all about pecking order. Gucci staged a strong show. Faded optic print minidresses with plunging necklines sparkled in bronze and gold Lurex, while burnished gold leather coats were fastened with jewel-encrusted belts. Was this the 60s or the 70s? A mixture, with a dash of Easy Rider chic thrown in. You've worn the biker jacket, but for autumn Mr Ford presents the biker coat, in black leather or soft brown herringbone. It will sell and sell, as will his elegant jewelled slingbacks. </p> <p>That was the \"Look at me\" end of the spectrum. There were also narrow hipster trousers, high-collared jackets with fluted edges and wet black jersey dresses that made for easy elegance. </p> <p>Why must fashion move so fast? It barely has one good idea before tossing it aside for the next. Of course, this keeps the tills ker-chinging. Miuccia Prada would have done better to stick with the \"sincere chic\" look she pioneered last season, but instead she went back to the 40s with floral-printed chiffon tea dresses and cashmere coats topped with fox fur collars tied askew. These looked lovely, as did the ribbon Prada used as belts on daffodil yellow coats and velvet dresses. Harder to wear were trapeze-line cropped jackets in thick crushed velvet, calf-length pleated bowling skirts and stiff herringbone dresses with diagonal purple stripes. Shoes and bags - the things everyone will buy - were strong as usual.

      "bodyText": "Growing old is neither easy nor graceful. It is particularly angst-ridden if you're in the fashion business, where youthful beauty is prized over everything. At the shows, you see the Milan grans, powdered and buffed and dressed in their \u00a35,000 outfits, and you wonder what possible relevance a wisp of see-through chiffon blouse or a sequined miniskirt can have to their lives. True, they can appreciate these things on an aesthetic level, but how can you get excited about clothes you can't wear? You can't. That's why there is such an outcry when hotpants are revived, or yellow, or sheer. Only a model can look good in those, nary a real woman. And so fashion editors (who are real women, honest) dismiss these trends in their journals and avidly wait for black to come back again. Which, of course, it always does. There is no mystery attached to why the Italians sell such a lot of clothes. Women want to look thinner. Taller. More powerful. Comfy in the daytime and sexy in the evening. And that's what Milan does. That's why, however creative and wonderful London might be, it will never, ever have the clout of Milan because there is only a limited market for flesh-coloured leather corsets and chair covers that turn into dresses. It was a vibrant season, literally. Not only was colour everywhere but pattern, too. Geometric prints zigzagged their way down the catwalk so loudly that donning pretentious black shades was a sensible idea. Clothes that give you a headache? Not instantly desirable, but wait. Let's start with the most influential designers, since Milan is all about pecking order. Gucci staged a strong show. Faded optic print minidresses with plunging necklines sparkled in bronze and gold Lurex, while burnished gold leather coats were fastened with jewel-encrusted belts. Was this the 60s or the 70s? A mixture, with a dash of Easy Rider chic thrown in. You've worn the biker jacket, but for autumn Mr Ford presents the biker coat, in black leather or soft brown herringbone. It will sell and sell, as will his elegant jewelled slingbacks. That was the \"Look at me\" end of the spectrum. There were also narrow hipster trousers, high-collared jackets with fluted edges and wet black jersey dresses that made for easy elegance. Why must fashion move so fast? It barely has one good idea before tossing it aside for the next. Of course, this keeps the tills ker-chinging. Miuccia Prada would have done better to stick with the \"sincere chic\" look she pioneered last season, but instead she went back to the 40s with floral-printed chiffon tea dresses and cashmere coats topped with fox fur collars tied askew. These looked lovely, as did the ribbon Prada used as belts on daffodil yellow coats and velvet dresses. Harder to wear were trapeze-line cropped jackets in thick crushed velvet, calf-length pleated bowling skirts and stiff herringbone dresses with diagonal purple stripes. Shoes and bags - the things everyone will buy - were strong as usual. Two-tone mules with a slight wedge and herringbone/leather weekend bags will sell out before they hit the shops. Versus had an excellent season. Here was Gisele in a tight turquoise Lycra dress, all big backcombed hair and bright red lips. This was the 80s, but with no New Romantic ruffles, just clean colours (red, yellow, purple, green) and happy patterns.

      "body": "<p>Like most anniversary dates this one is open to quibbles. There had been plenty of revolutionary socialist parties formed in late Victorian England and trade unionists elected to parliament in alliance with the Liberals. At Bradford in 1893 an Independent Labour Party, the famous ILP, had been formed, five years after Keir Hardie's Scottish Labour Party.</p> <p>But the modest gathering at the Memorial Hall in Farringdon Street, not far from the Guardian's London home, on February 27 1900 was the one that would matter in terms of continuity and achievement. By forming the Labour Representation Commitee, with the ''tepid'' support of the TUC, the mixture of trade unionists, middle class Fabians and assorted leftwing socialists created a parliamentary platform for Labour's coalition that would see it elbow aside the historic Liberal Party and form the first Labour government 24 years later.</p> <p>That divergence is now a matter of controversy since Tony Blair (though few of his senior colleagues) has repeatedly argued that the Lib-Lab split delivered the bulk of 20th British government into Conservative hands. Centre-left progressives, he believes, should edge towards cooperation and coalition to keep the Tories out in the 21st.</p> <p>What reinforces Blair's concern (and his obsession with re-election) is grim awareness that the progressive landslides of 1906, 1945 - Labour's annus mirabillis - and 1966 all melted away within 5 years, though many of their achievements in public education, welfare, health and housing (above all, Nye Bevan's NHS) endure.</p> <p>In 1900 two LRC MPs were elected, Hardie in Merthyr Tydfil, and Richard Bell, a railway worker in Derby. By 1906 the number of Labour MPs had risen to 29, largely thanks to the notorious (and Thatcherish) Taff Vale judgement which put union funds at risk from strike damages. With Labour support the new Liberal government reversed it, though the issue rumbled on. It still does.</p> <p>Radical though it was on social reform, Lords reform and tax, the New Liberalism failed to address falling wages. The result, famously recorded in George Dangerfield's Strange Death of Liberal England, was rising militancy, strikes and syndicalist thinking. Along with militant feminism and Ireland, it was all very New Labour.</p> <p>The situation was close to revolutionary. Then World War I broke out in August 1914 and most socialist parties across Europe went patriotic. Strictly speaking the Labour Party, as it was now called, was not yet socialist and its most charismatic leader, James Ramsay MacDonald, opposed the war. Arthur Henderson, Hardie's successor, joined the war coalition.</p> <p>The Fabian intellectual Beatrice Webb had already written in her diary ''Ramsay MacDonald is no longer a socialist,'' reflecting a nose for betrayal that would characterise Labour history. Only this week, the writer Hanif Kureishi, told the Guardian that New Labour deserves credit for improving race relations - ''much as one hates to admit it.''</p> <p>MacDonald's split with his party over the global financial crisis of 1929-31 ensured that he remains public enemy No 1 in Labour's pantheon of betrayal. When Neil Kinnock succeeded Michael Foot as Labour leader in 1983 one Trot magazine dubbed him ''The New MacDonald'' in huge type - on his first day.</p> <p>For most of its history Labour was dogged by the Communist Party of Great Britain, politically weak but industrially strong. But small Trotskyite groups linger on, sometimes in open hostility, entryist in the 80s (until Kinnock turned the tide), today rallying optimistically to ''help'' Ken Livingstone become London mayor on May 4.</p> <p>The old Labour adage was that it owed ''more to Methodism than to Marx.'' But the party's constitution became quasi-socialist in 1918. The war had made the state powerful and prestigious, as wars do, and Clause IV's pledge ''to secure for the workers by hand or by brain the fruits of their industry...on the basis of the common ownership of the means of production'' was intended to impress the middle class - and help squeeze the Liberals.</p> <p>In 1918 Labour duly got 2 million votes and 60 MPs. By 1924 there were 191. MacDonald's first 10 month minority government sought desperately to prove itself competent and respectable - shades of the 90s again - yet ended in the fiasco over the forged Zinoviev Letter. It was published by M16 courtesy of the Daily Mail, ''the Forgers Gazette'' as Michael Foot still calls the Tory tabloid which also hounded him.</p> <p>Modestly reformist the 1924 and 1929 governments hardly frightened the propertied classes. Even the TUC general strike of 1926 lasted barely a week, with the parliamentary leadership keen to see it end. '' Who are the leaders of the Labour Party in England,'' asked a French intellectual in 1931. ''Not intellectuals, but trade unionists...hard working, rather timid, very conservative negotiators, they are born parliamentarians.''</p> <p>Reduced from 289 to just 46 seats in the national government election of 1931 - Labour's worst moment - the 30s were Auden's ''low dishonest decade'' for a party which embraced pacifism more readily than the radical economics of Keynes and such diverse disciples as Oswald (ex-Labour) Mosley, Nye Bevan, Lloyd George, even Harold Macmillan.</p> <p>But if the 30s were bad the 40s were to be Labour's finest hour. Its benches, not the Tories, cheered Churchill when he first appeared in the Commons as prime minister in 1940. Its leaders, Bevin, Morrison ( Peter Mandelson's grandpa) Greenwood and their deceptively mild stop-gap leader (1935-55), Clem Attlee, sustained the coalition in war.</p> <p>In peace Labour ejected Churchill and (''we are the masters now'') finally got the chance to liquidate the empire, create the post-war order ( Nato, the UN, the cold war) and implement domestic reform. Clause IV had its moment as even the hated mine-owners saw their pits nationalised. In 1951 Labour won record votes, but lost power for 13 years.</p> <p>The prosperous 50s were also damaging and divisive, Gaitskell's proto-modernisers versus the Bevanites. Harold Wilson skillfully reunited them around an inclusive moderniser's slogan - ''the white heat of technology'' - in 1964. He mocked the Tories out of power with the help of a new magazine, Private Eye. But Wilson's over- nimble footwork gave opportunism a bad name.</p> <p>Far from becoming ''the natural party of government'' (Wilson's boast) Labour was now in trouble. With old industries crumbling the unions funked reform on Barbara Castle's terms in 1969, thwarted Ted Heath's version - in another cycle of revived industrial militancy in 1974 - only to be hammered by Margaret Thatcher after 1979.</p> <p>She launched the most sustained assault on all Labour had painstakingly built since 1900. Not every citidel fell, the NHS was cherished in Bath as well as Barnsley. But the old industries crumbled still faster while the new ones - more often services not manufacturing - did not inspire the kind of collectivist solidarity around the factory, the Labour club and the Daily Mirror which had sustained the party.</p> <p>Higher education for everyone, largely a Labour legacy, enticed what would one day be called the ''aspirational'' and upwardly mobile'' to the suburbs, leaving behind what Blairism now dubs the socially-excluded. '' They have rottweillers, wear shell suits and read the Sun,'' one Old Labour MP observed bitterly. Attlee's grandchildren became Thatcher's kids.</p> <p>If Wilson's 1964-70 governments had fluffed the big economic issues (we still bask in its social reforms, which Mrs Thatcher attacked, but did not repeal), Jim Callaghan's was under-appreciated. His deputy, the literary Michael Foot liked nautical metaphor. Sailor Jim sailed through a typhoon of global financial disorder, strikes and layoffs, hyper-inflation, war and terrorism, from 1976-79 - with no Commons majority at all.</p> <p>But it was ''Maggie'' who inherited the North Sea oil boom and those assertive young voters (''deference is dead''), while Labour engaged in yet another bitter internal war. It was fought between the realists-cum-modernisers, Foot, Kinnock, Smith, Blair and Brown ( Peter Mandelson usually in the background), and the socialist core which had rallied to the mesmerising sound of Tony Benn, Labour's golden boy turned radical prophet.</p> <p>His family had followed the 20th century path: from Liberal to Labour to socialist - but not back again, though son, Hilary, got elected in 1999 as ''a Benn, but not a Bennite.'' The modernisers had won, the voters had rewarded them with that record 179-seat majority.</p> <p>As Tony Blair heads towards his third anniversary with a 50:29:15% lead in this week's polls, it looks all-but-certain that he will get that elusive second working majority at Westminster. Yet it would be a rash, not to say complacent, New Labour apparatchik who believes that the the globalised world, managerial and pragmatic, which Blair inherited and seeks to harness will last for ever.</p> <p>If nothing else, Labour's turbulent history shows how the pendulum swings back in circumstances none too hard to forsee. World depression, war, environmental crisis\u0085 any of them could shift the political fulcrum away from laid-back individualism and consumer power towards collectivism, ideology renewed egalitarianism. Eco-militancy is already thriving.</p> <p>If that happens plenty of people inside Labour's ranks will be quick to say ''told you so'' and seize the hour, as Ken Livingstone may be tempted to attempt to seize it this week. ''Fairness and efficiency'' is Blair's equivalent of Wilson's white heat. But, as always, Labour pride in its achievements is mixed with Labour disappointment at its failures.</p> <p>The party may be disciplined and quiet, but it is not dead.

The explosives were made safe by an army bomb disposal expert, close to the perimeter fence of Shackleton Barracks at Ballykelly, Co Londonderry. No-one was injured in the explosion, but Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis said it underlined the need for disarmament. \"There have now been a series of disturbing incidents, clearly intended to intimidate government,\" said the party's security spokesman. \"All of these incidents vindicate those who want to achieve an end to violence, the threat of violence and an early start to decommissioning.\" There was no warning for the attack and no immediate claim of responsibility. However, suspicion may fall on the dissident republican Continuity IRA, the only republican group not to declare a ceasefire, who were responsible for the bombing which caused extensive to a hotel in Irvinestown, Co Fermanagh nearly three weeks ago. It was the first attack on an army base since the dissident republican campaign of 1997 and 1998 which ended with the bombing of Omagh, Co Tyrone, and the deaths of 29 people and injury of hundreds more. An investigation will be mounted into how the explosives were smuggled into the base on a disused airfield, which is currently home to battalions of the Royal Welch Fusiliers and Royal Irish Regiment. Democratic Unionist Party assembly member Gregory Campbell condemned the attack and said it showed it would be wrong to scale down security precautions. Mr Campbell said: \"I think it would be a mistake in the times in which we live if the government or if the GOC or chief constable were to scale down unnecessarily routine security arrangements which mean that attacks like this can take place. \"Last night's events show they can and do take place, so it is foolish to routinely run down security arrangements. \"Security must be maintained and improved where there is a risk to human life.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The fragmentation of the rail industry since privatisation and a breakdown of the safety system were cited last night as the underlying causes of the Southall rail crash in September 1997.</p> <p>Strongly worded statements by Professor John Uff, chairman of the Southall rail inquiry, and Bill Callaghan, chairman of the health and safety commission, yesterday brought new pressures to bear on the government to reverse the rail sell-off.</p> <p>Prof Uff highlighted the industry's post-privatisation fragmentation in his report and strongly criticised Railtrack for replacing one set of rules \"with a hotchpotch of different rules\".</p> <p>He said that the accident, in which seven people died when a Great Western Trains passenger express hit a freight train, occurred in \"circumstances which were exacerbated by privatisation\".</p> <p>In a determined attempt to forestall more criticism, Mr Callaghan said that he had summoned all those involved in the Southall crash to an action meeting.</p> <p>\"Let them be in no doubt that those who use and work on the railway will not tolerate any delay,\" he declared.</p> <p>\"The system broke down as a result of the fragmentation of the industry. There is a need to look at human behaviour as much as equipment in effective safety systems.\"</p> <p>Prof Uff's conclusions particularly expose the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, on the issue of privatisation of the rail network. However, Mr Prescott welcomed the \"very thorough report\", saying that many of the issues raised had already been addressed by measures since the crash.</p> <p>Although the train driver, Larry Harrison - who went through two yellow lights and a third, red, light before applying the brakes - is primarily held responsible for the accident, Prof Uff's report is mainly concerned with the failure of safety systems.</p> <p>The automatic train protection (ATP) was not functioning on Mr Harrison's train, and the in-cab automatic warning system (AWS) broke down the day before and had not been repaired.</p> <p>Prof Uff said yesterday that Railtrack should put into place clear rules to stop any train running that did not have an operative AWS. \"The train should be taken out of service immediately,\" he said.</p> <p>But Railtrack admitted later that it was consulting rail companies on a variation to Prof Uff's recommendation. Rather than immediately stopping any passenger train that proves to have ineffective safety equipment, Railtrack argues that so long as the cab is double manned and its speed does not exceed 70mph, it is safe to allow it to proceed to a convenient stopping point.</p> <p>Rod Muttram, Railtrack's safety director, said the company had pledged to seek continuous safety improvements \"to ensure that safety remains the number one priority of the industry\". Railtrack would also have to look at AWS in the light of the report's recommendations, he added.</p> <p>Relatives of the Southall victims welcomed the report but blamed the rail companies for the failure of safety regimes. They also blamed Mr Prescott for allowing Railtrack to keep control of safety in a separate subsidiary company.</p> <p>Mr Prescott said he had already taken steps to build on the sort of problems highlighted by Prof Uff. The health and safety executive would be directly responsible for deciding whether train companies were operating safely.</p> <p>He expected GWT to be among the first of the rail companies to be subjected to a new regime of annual audits. AWS would be replaced in two years by an improved safety system costing \u00a3250m, and within 10 years ATP would be installed throughout the network at a cost of \u00a32bn.</p> <p>Prof Uff also criticised the inexperience of some of those running the industry.</p> <p>Within hours of his remarks an outspoken statement from Go-Ahead, the transport company operating the Thames Trains service involved in the Paddington rail crash last October, claimed that the Paddington crash would not harm its bids to take over further rail franchises.</p> <p>Martin Ballinger, Go-Ahead's managing director, said: \"From our own indications, we reckon that at the time of the accident, our safety procedures were as good as the vast majority of the industry, and better than an awful lot.</p> <p>\"I don't think our personal reputation is at stake, and we can hold our head up high and say we operated safely within the safety standards.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The fragmentation of the rail industry since privatisation and a breakdown of the safety system were cited last night as the underlying causes of the Southall rail crash in September 1997. Strongly worded statements by Professor John Uff, chairman of the Southall rail inquiry, and Bill Callaghan, chairman of the health and safety commission, yesterday brought new pressures to bear on the government to reverse the rail sell-off. Prof Uff highlighted the industry's post-privatisation fragmentation in his report and strongly criticised Railtrack for replacing one set of rules \"with a hotchpotch of different rules\". He said that the accident, in which seven people died when a Great Western Trains passenger express hit a freight train, occurred in \"circumstances which were exacerbated by privatisation\". In a determined attempt to forestall more criticism, Mr Callaghan said that he had summoned all those involved in the Southall crash to an action meeting. \"Let them be in no doubt that those who use and work on the railway will not tolerate any delay,\" he declared. \"The system broke down as a result of the fragmentation of the industry. There is a need to look at human behaviour as much as equipment in effective safety systems.\" Prof Uff's conclusions particularly expose the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, on the issue of privatisation of the rail network. However, Mr Prescott welcomed the \"very thorough report\", saying that many of the issues raised had already been addressed by measures since the crash. Although the train driver, Larry Harrison - who went through two yellow lights and a third, red, light before applying the brakes - is primarily held responsible for the accident, Prof Uff's report is mainly concerned with the failure of safety systems. The automatic train protection (ATP) was not functioning on Mr Harrison's train, and the in-cab automatic warning system (AWS) broke down the day before and had not been repaired. Prof Uff said yesterday that Railtrack should put into place clear rules to stop any train running that did not have an operative AWS. \"The train should be taken out of service immediately,\" he said. But Railtrack admitted later that it was consulting rail companies on a variation to Prof Uff's recommendation. Rather than immediately stopping any passenger train that proves to have ineffective safety equipment, Railtrack argues that so long as the cab is double manned and its speed does not exceed 70mph, it is safe to allow it to proceed to a convenient stopping point. Rod Muttram, Railtrack's safety director, said the company had pledged to seek continuous safety improvements \"to ensure that safety remains the number one priority of the industry\". Railtrack would also have to look at AWS in the light of the report's recommendations, he added. Relatives of the Southall victims welcomed the report but blamed the rail companies for the failure of safety regimes. They also blamed Mr Prescott for allowing Railtrack to keep control of safety in a separate subsidiary company. Mr Prescott said he had already taken steps to build on the sort of problems highlighted by Prof Uff. The health and safety executive would be directly responsible for deciding whether train companies were operating safely. He expected GWT to be among the first of the rail companies to be subjected to a new regime of annual audits. AWS would be replaced in two years by an improved safety system costing \u00a3250m, and within 10 years ATP would be installed throughout the network at a cost of \u00a32bn. Prof Uff also criticised the inexperience of some of those running the industry. Within hours of his remarks an outspoken statement from Go-Ahead, the transport company operating the Thames Trains service involved in the Paddington rail crash last October, claimed that the Paddington crash would not harm its bids to take over further rail franchises. Martin Ballinger, Go-Ahead's managing director, said: \"From our own indications, we reckon that at the time of the accident, our safety procedures were as good as the vast majority of the industry, and better than an awful lot. \"I don't think our personal reputation is at stake, and we can hold our head up high and say we operated safely within the safety standards.\"",

      "body": "<p>How does it feel to be an international pariah? Offer British blood to save the life of a Canadian, American or New Zealander and you will be politely turned down. To make matters worse, any of the citizens of these three countries who visited Britain for a six-month period between 1980 and the end of 1996 are also banned from giving blood.</p> <p>The reason is that Britain's national dish is tainted. Visitors from the former colonies are certain to have wanted to sample the delights of roast beef and yorkshire pudding. As a result, so the blood-donor agencies of these countries have decided, their citizens might be infected with the \"British disease\" of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human equivalent of mad cow disease. These visitors may already have unwittingly sentenced themselves to an early death from this terrible disease by visiting Britain and they do not want them to pass it on to fellow citizens back home in their pints of blood. Now the French, who claim their would not eat our beef anyway, are anxious to rub salt in the wounds by banning any of their citizens, who have so much as set foot in Britain in the same period, from giving blood.</p> <p>A visitor from outer space might be forgiven for avoiding Britain as a place of pestilence.</p> <p>Let's examine the evidence for our quarantine as unclean inhabitants of an offshore island. So far there have been 52 victims of the human variant of this disease (known as nvCJD). It is a crippling and always fatal disease that rots the brain and reduces people to cabbages. The tragedy is that it strikes mostly at teenagers and young adults; middle-aged parents face watching their children die slowly and painfully.</p> <p>The problem is that the scientists do not know where it will all end. They believe that the incubation period is so long that eventually 400,000 of us may die of it - although this is an absolute upper estimate it is a terrifying possibility. Who will live and who will die no one knows, the only certainty is that anyone who ate beef in the 15 years or so after the early 80s might get the disease.</p> <p>It has taken a long time for the awfulness of this all this to sink in. From the first it was clear that the scandal had wrecked an export industry. It has also made Britain a byword for disgraceful farming practices, cutting corners to make a fast buck by turning cows into cannibals.</p> <p>It was some time before we realised that this in turn made our blood contaminated - or at least potentially so. In 1998 the UK expert advisory committee said there was a theoretical chance that transmission could come from infected blood. This would be through the white blood cells. As a result all white blood cells were removed from all donated blood in the UK. As a further precaution all plasma used for the manufacture of blood products, like the factor VIII, used as a clotting agent by haemophiliacs, is imported from abroad.</p> <p>The shame of all this was compounded last year when our former colonies began to single out their own citizens who had visited the mother country as potentially unclean too - and now the old enemy, the French, have joined in.</p> <p>The department of health in London is taking a balanced view. There was no evidence that nvCJD had ever been transmitted in human blood. The two cases of nvCJD in France has almost certainly come from French people eating cattle exported from Britain which were already carrying the disease.</p> <p>The action of the four countries in banning British blood is understandable.

      "bodyText": "How does it feel to be an international pariah? Offer British blood to save the life of a Canadian, American or New Zealander and you will be politely turned down. To make matters worse, any of the citizens of these three countries who visited Britain for a six-month period between 1980 and the end of 1996 are also banned from giving blood. The reason is that Britain's national dish is tainted. Visitors from the former colonies are certain to have wanted to sample the delights of roast beef and yorkshire pudding. As a result, so the blood-donor agencies of these countries have decided, their citizens might be infected with the \"British disease\" of new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the human equivalent of mad cow disease. These visitors may already have unwittingly sentenced themselves to an early death from this terrible disease by visiting Britain and they do not want them to pass it on to fellow citizens back home in their pints of blood. Now the French, who claim their would not eat our beef anyway, are anxious to rub salt in the wounds by banning any of their citizens, who have so much as set foot in Britain in the same period, from giving blood. A visitor from outer space might be forgiven for avoiding Britain as a place of pestilence. Let's examine the evidence for our quarantine as unclean inhabitants of an offshore island. So far there have been 52 victims of the human variant of this disease (known as nvCJD). It is a crippling and always fatal disease that rots the brain and reduces people to cabbages. The tragedy is that it strikes mostly at teenagers and young adults; middle-aged parents face watching their children die slowly and painfully. The problem is that the scientists do not know where it will all end. They believe that the incubation period is so long that eventually 400,000 of us may die of it - although this is an absolute upper estimate it is a terrifying possibility. Who will live and who will die no one knows, the only certainty is that anyone who ate beef in the 15 years or so after the early 80s might get the disease. It has taken a long time for the awfulness of this all this to sink in. From the first it was clear that the scandal had wrecked an export industry. It has also made Britain a byword for disgraceful farming practices, cutting corners to make a fast buck by turning cows into cannibals. It was some time before we realised that this in turn made our blood contaminated - or at least potentially so. In 1998 the UK expert advisory committee said there was a theoretical chance that transmission could come from infected blood. This would be through the white blood cells. As a result all white blood cells were removed from all donated blood in the UK. As a further precaution all plasma used for the manufacture of blood products, like the factor VIII, used as a clotting agent by haemophiliacs, is imported from abroad. The shame of all this was compounded last year when our former colonies began to single out their own citizens who had visited the mother country as potentially unclean too - and now the old enemy, the French, have joined in. The department of health in London is taking a balanced view. There was no evidence that nvCJD had ever been transmitted in human blood. The two cases of nvCJD in France has almost certainly come from French people eating cattle exported from Britain which were already carrying the disease. The action of the four countries in banning British blood is understandable. After all there is the terrible memory of the tainted blood scandal of the 80s when 1,200 haemophiliacs were infected with HIV from imported human plasma products and 600 died. Three thousand got hepatitis C. In France this is currently an emotive issue, because a former prime minister and two other ministers were tried last year for failing to prevent the use of Aids-infected blood by the French health service in the 80s. The current crop of politicians does not want to risk the same with CJD-contaminated blood. The problem for the French is that up to 22% of their blood donors have visited Britain in the last 15 years and they are already critically short of supplies in the hospital service. The risk of losing lives because of shortage of blood in hospitals is greater than the chance of getting nvCJD. But the stigma of Britons being classed as unclean remains. The long running CJD inquiry is still to report and the evidence of the appalling behaviour of the ministry of agriculture in trying to cover it all up still haunts us.

Folk thought highly of it then. Devotees think highly of it now. It's nice to know that some things remain constant while all around is change, if not decay. There are generous helpings of ashak (leek stuffed with lamb and lentils), maushawa (yoghurt, chickpea and meatball soup) and mash pilaw (rice and lentils). The cooking has a flavour of India, Turkey and North Africa, and there is ample evidence of those countries' love of carpets, as well as Afghanistan's own, as interior decoration. Easy to eat for less than \u00a315, lunch at \u00a36.95 is a bargain. Quick bites... where to eat out in under 15 minutes De Gustibus, 53 Blandford Street, London W1. Tel: 0171-486 6608 Bakery, cafe, deli, all things to all people. Well, perhaps not quite. It's tiny, for a start, cheery, cluttered and cosy. Seats maybe 12. But then there's the queue out into the street come breakfast and lunch, and all for the bread and fillings or the short list of hot dishes. Nothing costs less than \u00a31.25 or more than \u00a34.25. The tortino - double-filled focaccia with mozzarella, vegetables and olives - is a megastar among sandwiches. Less a sandwich than a lunch in the hand. Other sarnies, savoury dishes and puddings are made with the same mad-cap enthusiasm. Chatty service. Fine coffee. On the menu: seakale What is it? Crambe maritima, a hardy perennial that grows wild on our shingle beaches. A long-lost vegetable, much loved by Victorians. Loved for what? Its delicate young shoots which, when blanched under a forcing pot, are ivory white with delicate pink and yellow leaf curls at the top. And taste? As ethereal as its appearance and as delicate, with a hint of bitterness. Brilliant blanched or steamed and served with fish. Making a bit of a comeback? -Ish. What's with this -ish? Hardly anyone seems to grow it in this country any more. So how can I get some? Ask at your greengrocer - no, not Sainsbury's. A real greengrocer; they might be able to get it from France. Cheat's kitchen Spicy tomato sauce One onion Two cloves garlic One can tomatoes Worcester sauce Tomato puree Red wine vinegar Sugar, white wine 1 Slice the onion and garlic and fry until soft. 2 Whizz up in processor, adding the other ingredients according to taste, using a teaspoon. 3 Heat up and serve on pasta with grated parmesan. Julie Frew, Birmingham Food on the net www.lobster.co.uk Catering for those who like a bit of online luxury, this Rocco Forte-backed site boasts its intention to be \"the Harrods food hall of cyberspace\". It's certainly stocked with fine foods, from caviar and foie gras to, well, lobster (which, for the squeamish, arrives cooked). Deluxe hampers too, of course. Pros: Great choice of food, freshly and speedily delivered, at surprisingly reasonable prices. A snappily designed site. Cons: Our delivery was a bit late. Lobster can only be delivered to London addresses. Delivery: Next day nationwide, same day in London (between 5pm and 9pm) if you order before 10am. Charge: \u00a34.95, orders over \u00a375 free.",

Mr Straw announced the change when he unveiled his second bill to limit the right of defendants to choose a crown court trial in front of a jury. A cross-party coalition in the House of Lords inflicted a crushing defeat on his first bill to introduce the change last month and 59 Labour MPs have already indicated that they object to the measure and want the whole question referred to an official government inquiry into the criminal justice system. It reports this summer. The government has threatened to invoke the parliament act and overrule the Lords if they try to reject it again after it has gone through the Commons. The second reading of the new bill is likely to be within three weeks. The home secretary's new mode of trial (number two) bill drops a requirement for magistrates to take account of the effect of a conviction on the reputation or livelihood of a defendant. Magistrates will also have to give reasons if they refuse to allow a case to be heard in the crown court. The bill will take away from about 18,000 defendants the right to choose whether their case is heard in front of a jury in the crown court or in the magistrates court. Most serious offences are automatically tried in front of a jury and most minor offences are heard by magistrates but there is a group of \"middle-ranking\" crimes, such as theft and burglary - most of which involve questions of personal honesty - in which defendants currently have a choice. Mr Straw's critics had claimed that the \"reputation and livelihood\" test would lead to a two-tier system of justice whereby a middle-class bank manager with no previous convictions would automatically qualify for the more expensive jury trial while the homeless and unemployed would be restricted to the magistrates court. The home secretary announced that he had dropped the test from the new bill and that instead magistrates will have to take into account the nature of the case, the circumstances of the offence and whether the punishment they have the power to impose is adequate to match the offence.

BBC TV quoted a statement from Lara saying he had decided to step down after \"moderate success and devastating failures.\" Lara was first appointed captain in the 1996-97 season when Courtney Walsh was injured. He took over on a permanent basis for the home series against England in 1997-98. A successor has yet to be named for the upcoming series with Zimbabwe, with the first Test on March 16. Lara said: \"There is a need for me to withdraw from my present leadership position.\" Lara still holds the world record for the highest Test and first-class scores but a run of disastrous results under his captaincy made his position untenable. The most recent blow was losing all five one-day internationals in New Zealand after a 2-0 Test-series defeat. After one of the one-day defeats Lara was said to be close to tears when he talked about \"trying to salvage a legacy.\" There had also been massive disappointment on the 1998-99 tour of South Africa. It began with a row between the players and the West Indies cricket board over pay and conditions, and ended in a humiliating 5-0 defeat in the Test series. A home series with Australia last year finished 2-2 with Lara's supreme batting saving the day, but the trip to New Zealand looks to have been the final straw.",

      "trailText": "<p>The Dardenne brothers tell Jonathan Romney how the down-at-heel Belgian steel town they grew up in inspired their film Rosetta</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Seraing is a down-at-heel steel town that is effectively a suburb of Li\u00e8ge, in eastern Belgium. It has an unemployment rate of about 25%, and most of its smelting furnaces and rolling mills have closed down, although two chimneys on the banks of the Meuse still belch out sulphurous yellow fumes.</p> <p>In the lower town, at the foot of a hill, conveyor belts and ramps hang over canyons of disused factory walls, and a drab red-light district glows with more of a chemical purple and blue. It's the last place on earth you'd expect to inspire great cinema; even Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, who grew up and continue to work here, admit: \"It's rather gloomy - not a fun place.\" </p> <p>Yet against all odds, Seraing has inspired the Dardenne brothers for more than 20 years as film-makers, and most recently produced a world-class feature, the surprise outsider at Cannes last year. Their film Rosetta hit Cannes like an unaccustomed bombshell of real cinema. Its kinetic, morally tough, no-frills realism won not only the Palme d'Or, but a shared best actress prize for Emilie Dequenne, aged 17 when she won the award in May last year, as a taciturn girl living on a campsite with an alcoholic mother, and doggedly battling through a succession of no-hope jobs. </p> <p>It seems the ultimate Cannes fairy tale, and with a new brotherly duo for the press to file alongside the Coens, Tavianis, Farrellys, Wachowskis et al. But the Dardennes are no fresh-faced debutants. They are in their mid- to late 40s and have been making films since the 70s, although the world only heard of them four years ago when their feature La Promesse (The Promise) got them on the festival circuit for the first time. </p> <p>But it's no accident they have been Belgium's best-kept secret: they're none too anxious to sell themselves. Jean-Pierre, the older brother, says of the post-Cannes press attention, \"I find it all a bit pornographic. I don't like talking that much, explaining why I do this, why I do that - it goes against my nature.\" Both confess they tend to be afflicted by doubt and find it emotionally difficult to get films made. </p> <p>The brothers have an office in a stately, austere building by the river in central Li\u00e8ge. It's home to two companies, their feature outlet, Les Films du Fleuve, and D\u00e9rives, their video workshop, which produces half a dozen documentaries a year by other film-makers. Until recently, Jean-Pierre ran an audio-visual workshop at Li\u00e8ge university, while Luc still teaches screenwriting in Brussels, where he lives. It's a tight family set-up: Jean-Pierre's wife is also their set photographer. </p> <p>The general assumption with siblings in film - especially if they're this reclusive - is that they must be desperately weird, but the Dardennes seem as normal as you can get. Luc is chattier, Jean-Pierre more solemn, and they're a little spiky with each other. When I arrive, Luc, the more dapper of the pair, is grumbling about a doctor's appointment he thinks he might miss, and there's a testy altercation over one of my questions. \"No, what he's saying...\" Luc begins to explain. \"No, I understand what he's saying,\" mutters the burlier Jean-Pierre, who has a slight look of Ronnie Biggs. But they muster up sandwiches and coffee, and are genial as can be. </p> <p>When they began making films, their work was strictly a local concern. Although neither brother ever belonged to a political party, they started making videos as a form of direct action. \"We didn't think of ourselves as film-makers,\" Luc says. \"We went to local housing estates, strikes, factories, trying to do political work, making interventions as film-makers. We thought: people don't know each other, no one knows who's living next to them, so we'll make portraits of people and show them on Sundays in a garage or a cafe. People would see them and think, 'Oh look, there's old what's-his-name.' We tried to form bonds between people.\" </p> <p>In a sense, they're still making community portraits. Rosetta and its predecessor, La Promesse - about a teenage boy whose slum landlord father ruthlessly exploits illegal immigrants - have the hardened edge of reality about them. The term \"gritty\" has never been more apposite, but the Dardennes insist they aim for realism, not naturalism. \"Naturalism,\" Jean-Pierre explains, \"is something picturesque, like a historical TV mini-series - it's when you pile on the details. We call our cinema 'realism' because it's inspired by the everyday world we live in.\" </p> <p>\"Our realism,\" says Luc, \"is stripped down to the bone. We try and take away as much as we can and keep what's really significant.\" Everything comes directly from Seraing, Luc says. \"When we're writing, we immediately see the streets, the houses, the people - even if they don't exist any more, because much of the town has disappeared. It's a sort of womb for us - we like to dive back into it when we're working on a character.\" </p> <p>They're not in a hurry to turn their attention to the outside world. \"It might seem weird, but we're not great travellers,\" Jean-Pierre admits. Luc adds, \"We need a place where we can sweat it out - a sort of sauna. If we were anywhere else, we'd have to recreate that sort of closed space for ourselves.\" But, Jean-Pierre speculates, \"it could be the Seraing in our heads doesn't actually have that much to do with the real one. We grew up here so the place inhabits us, in a way.\" </p> <p>The brothers are no spoilt bourgeois scions moonlighting with tales of the hard-scrabble life. Sons of a factory draughtsman, they've struggled throughout their career. Originally working for theatre and film director Armand Gatti, they were inspired by him to do their own work; and to raise money for their first equipment, both worked as labourers on a nuclear plant. For years, they were absolute outsiders: when I ask how they were seen by other Belgian directors, they reply, \"We weren't.\" </p> <p>Later, when their second fiction feature was a flop, they ran up enormous debts, which took years to pay off. Even a Palme d'Or, they emphasise, hardly means they're raking it in, especially since they're slow workers and it may be a long time before they complete their next film. Cannes success has, however, made a difference in other ways: received by both public and media as a national triumph, Rosetta also inspired the passing of a bill, known as the \"Plan Rosetta\", that aims to protect the interests of young, low-paid workers. </p> <p>In the 80s, the brothers clocked up several documentaries, on topics ranging from the Walloon resistance movement to Polish emigration. But their start in fiction was difficult. They started tentatively by adapting a play, Falsch, in 1986. The follow-up, Je Pense \u00e0 Vous, six years later, about a steelworker who loses his job, was a disaster - and not only commercially.</p> <p>They were out of their depth, they admit. \"We're always stressed when we shoot, and that can be good, but on that film, it was negative stress. We were afraid of our own fear.\" They still sound shell-shocked talking about it. They didn't know their own minds, and ended up being dominated by their director of photography. \"We learned that what happens on set is a power struggle,\" says Jean-Pierre. \"If they know you're afraid, you're screwed.\" </p> <p>Left with nothing to lose, they realised they needed to be in charge on La Promesse. \"Deciding that we'd be responsible for the work every day, from eight in the morning to six at night, it got us moving on our own track.\" Putting together a team they were comfortable with, they returned to the way they'd started out, with Jean-Pierre supervising photography and editing and Luc overseeing the sound. </p> <p>The brothers like the viewer to be part of the collaborative process. Theirs is not a realism that lays down the law and shows you how the world is: you have to find your own way in it. Hence the telegraphic, sketchy nature of their narratives, which let us work out for ourselves who these characters are and where they've been. \"We're interested in telling stories that happen in the present, and the backstory is something the viewer constructs. If you put it there on the screen, the present becomes nothing more than the consequence of the past. But because certain things stay in the shadows, you feel things are happening in the present - you have to have shadow to have light.\" </p> <p>The Dardennes' latter features are exciting, athletic films in which space feels like an obstacle course to be negotiated at some peril - the treacherous building sites of La Promesse, the mud-steeped, inhospitable trailer park where Rosetta lives. The films' ragged feel makes it seem as if they fell into shape by accident, but the brothers are sticklers for working out timing and positioning. On Rosetta, they even devised a system of poking the actors with rods to nudge them into place. You clearly need to be in shape to make a film like Rosetta, set in inclement weather with key scenes by a filthy lake. </p> <p>The brothers crack up laughing, thinking of technicians coming a cropper during fast manoeuvres: \"There were a few casualties.\" Most notable is the final scene, a marathon five-minute single take, in which Emilie Dequenne struggles with a hefty gas canister, herself apparently at physical breaking point. \"We did let out five kilos of gas - it weighed 13 kilos rather than 18.\" </p> <p>Dequenne was selected for more than her ability to heave canisters. Her performance, exuding traumatically repressed fury, absolutely merits the Cannes award. An unknown who had done some local theatre and taken elocution lessons, Dequenne was chosen from 300 applicants.</p> <p>The brothers were amused by her letter - \"wildly pretentious\", they say, still smiling at her chutzpah - but immediately knew they had their Rosetta when she acted out a chunk of the script. The performance is all the more astounding in that Dequenne clearly isn't the film's stubbornly uncommunicative feral child, but - when I briefly met her last year - an articulate and rather glamorous young woman who clearly has her showbiz future sorted out. She's now living in Paris and due to appear in her first costume drama. </p> <p>After the interview, Luc returns to Brussels, while Jean-Pierre takes me to Seraing to show me one of their key locations - a shabby, grey bus depot where Rosetta works at a waffle van. There's not much to see - just a boarded-up pizza restaurant tucked away beneath a crumbling network of brutalist flyovers, all looking even smaller and dingier than it does on screen.</p> <p>Further into Seraing, Jean-Pierre points out a row of shops. Rosetta walked up the street, he explains, and Igor, hero of La Promesse, walked down it: they were just shot from different angles. A portly character in a mouldy-looking fur cap emerges from a nearby house. Jean-Pierre waits till he's gone, then explains that he was the original model for the slum landlord in La Promesse. </p> <p>Seraing wouldn't seem to be the most fertile terrain for a filmic fictional world, yet the Dardennes seem to have teased their entire imaginative universe out of it. There are, as they say, a million stories in the naked city - and cities don't come any more naked than this.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Seraing is a down-at-heel steel town that is effectively a suburb of Li\u00e8ge, in eastern Belgium. It has an unemployment rate of about 25%, and most of its smelting furnaces and rolling mills have closed down, although two chimneys on the banks of the Meuse still belch out sulphurous yellow fumes. In the lower town, at the foot of a hill, conveyor belts and ramps hang over canyons of disused factory walls, and a drab red-light district glows with more of a chemical purple and blue. It's the last place on earth you'd expect to inspire great cinema; even Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, who grew up and continue to work here, admit: \"It's rather gloomy - not a fun place.\" Yet against all odds, Seraing has inspired the Dardenne brothers for more than 20 years as film-makers, and most recently produced a world-class feature, the surprise outsider at Cannes last year. Their film Rosetta hit Cannes like an unaccustomed bombshell of real cinema. Its kinetic, morally tough, no-frills realism won not only the Palme d'Or, but a shared best actress prize for Emilie Dequenne, aged 17 when she won the award in May last year, as a taciturn girl living on a campsite with an alcoholic mother, and doggedly battling through a succession of no-hope jobs. It seems the ultimate Cannes fairy tale, and with a new brotherly duo for the press to file alongside the Coens, Tavianis, Farrellys, Wachowskis et al. But the Dardennes are no fresh-faced debutants. They are in their mid- to late 40s and have been making films since the 70s, although the world only heard of them four years ago when their feature La Promesse (The Promise) got them on the festival circuit for the first time. But it's no accident they have been Belgium's best-kept secret: they're none too anxious to sell themselves. Jean-Pierre, the older brother, says of the post-Cannes press attention, \"I find it all a bit pornographic. I don't like talking that much, explaining why I do this, why I do that - it goes against my nature.\" Both confess they tend to be afflicted by doubt and find it emotionally difficult to get films made. The brothers have an office in a stately, austere building by the river in central Li\u00e8ge. It's home to two companies, their feature outlet, Les Films du Fleuve, and D\u00e9rives, their video workshop, which produces half a dozen documentaries a year by other film-makers. Until recently, Jean-Pierre ran an audio-visual workshop at Li\u00e8ge university, while Luc still teaches screenwriting in Brussels, where he lives. It's a tight family set-up: Jean-Pierre's wife is also their set photographer. The general assumption with siblings in film - especially if they're this reclusive - is that they must be desperately weird, but the Dardennes seem as normal as you can get. Luc is chattier, Jean-Pierre more solemn, and they're a little spiky with each other. When I arrive, Luc, the more dapper of the pair, is grumbling about a doctor's appointment he thinks he might miss, and there's a testy altercation over one of my questions. \"No, what he's saying...\" Luc begins to explain. \"No, I understand what he's saying,\" mutters the burlier Jean-Pierre, who has a slight look of Ronnie Biggs. But they muster up sandwiches and coffee, and are genial as can be. When they began making films, their work was strictly a local concern. Although neither brother ever belonged to a political party, they started making videos as a form of direct action. \"We didn't think of ourselves as film-makers,\" Luc says. \"We went to local housing estates, strikes, factories, trying to do political work, making interventions as film-makers. We thought: people don't know each other, no one knows who's living next to them, so we'll make portraits of people and show them on Sundays in a garage or a cafe. People would see them and think, 'Oh look, there's old what's-his-name.' We tried to form bonds between people.\" In a sense, they're still making community portraits. Rosetta and its predecessor, La Promesse - about a teenage boy whose slum landlord father ruthlessly exploits illegal immigrants - have the hardened edge of reality about them. The term \"gritty\" has never been more apposite, but the Dardennes insist they aim for realism, not naturalism. \"Naturalism,\" Jean-Pierre explains, \"is something picturesque, like a historical TV mini-series - it's when you pile on the details. We call our cinema 'realism' because it's inspired by the everyday world we live in.\" \"Our realism,\" says Luc, \"is stripped down to the bone. We try and take away as much as we can and keep what's really significant.\" Everything comes directly from Seraing, Luc says. \"When we're writing, we immediately see the streets, the houses, the people - even if they don't exist any more, because much of the town has disappeared. It's a sort of womb for us - we like to dive back into it when we're working on a character.\" They're not in a hurry to turn their attention to the outside world. \"It might seem weird, but we're not great travellers,\" Jean-Pierre admits. Luc adds, \"We need a place where we can sweat it out - a sort of sauna. If we were anywhere else, we'd have to recreate that sort of closed space for ourselves.\" But, Jean-Pierre speculates, \"it could be the Seraing in our heads doesn't actually have that much to do with the real one. We grew up here so the place inhabits us, in a way.\" The brothers are no spoilt bourgeois scions moonlighting with tales of the hard-scrabble life. Sons of a factory draughtsman, they've struggled throughout their career. Originally working for theatre and film director Armand Gatti, they were inspired by him to do their own work; and to raise money for their first equipment, both worked as labourers on a nuclear plant. For years, they were absolute outsiders: when I ask how they were seen by other Belgian directors, they reply, \"We weren't.\" Later, when their second fiction feature was a flop, they ran up enormous debts, which took years to pay off. Even a Palme d'Or, they emphasise, hardly means they're raking it in, especially since they're slow workers and it may be a long time before they complete their next film. Cannes success has, however, made a difference in other ways: received by both public and media as a national triumph, Rosetta also inspired the passing of a bill, known as the \"Plan Rosetta\", that aims to protect the interests of young, low-paid workers. In the 80s, the brothers clocked up several documentaries, on topics ranging from the Walloon resistance movement to Polish emigration. But their start in fiction was difficult. They started tentatively by adapting a play, Falsch, in 1986. The follow-up, Je Pense \u00e0 Vous, six years later, about a steelworker who loses his job, was a disaster - and not only commercially. They were out of their depth, they admit. \"We're always stressed when we shoot, and that can be good, but on that film, it was negative stress. We were afraid of our own fear.\" They still sound shell-shocked talking about it. They didn't know their own minds, and ended up being dominated by their director of photography. \"We learned that what happens on set is a power struggle,\" says Jean-Pierre. \"If they know you're afraid, you're screwed.\" Left with nothing to lose, they realised they needed to be in charge on La Promesse. \"Deciding that we'd be responsible for the work every day, from eight in the morning to six at night, it got us moving on our own track.\" Putting together a team they were comfortable with, they returned to the way they'd started out, with Jean-Pierre supervising photography and editing and Luc overseeing the sound. The brothers like the viewer to be part of the collaborative process. Theirs is not a realism that lays down the law and shows you how the world is: you have to find your own way in it. Hence the telegraphic, sketchy nature of their narratives, which let us work out for ourselves who these characters are and where they've been. \"We're interested in telling stories that happen in the present, and the backstory is something the viewer constructs. If you put it there on the screen, the present becomes nothing more than the consequence of the past. But because certain things stay in the shadows, you feel things are happening in the present - you have to have shadow to have light.\" The Dardennes' latter features are exciting, athletic films in which space feels like an obstacle course to be negotiated at some peril - the treacherous building sites of La Promesse, the mud-steeped, inhospitable trailer park where Rosetta lives. The films' ragged feel makes it seem as if they fell into shape by accident, but the brothers are sticklers for working out timing and positioning. On Rosetta, they even devised a system of poking the actors with rods to nudge them into place. You clearly need to be in shape to make a film like Rosetta, set in inclement weather with key scenes by a filthy lake. The brothers crack up laughing, thinking of technicians coming a cropper during fast manoeuvres: \"There were a few casualties.\" Most notable is the final scene, a marathon five-minute single take, in which Emilie Dequenne struggles with a hefty gas canister, herself apparently at physical breaking point. \"We did let out five kilos of gas - it weighed 13 kilos rather than 18.\" Dequenne was selected for more than her ability to heave canisters. Her performance, exuding traumatically repressed fury, absolutely merits the Cannes award. An unknown who had done some local theatre and taken elocution lessons, Dequenne was chosen from 300 applicants. The brothers were amused by her letter - \"wildly pretentious\", they say, still smiling at her chutzpah - but immediately knew they had their Rosetta when she acted out a chunk of the script. The performance is all the more astounding in that Dequenne clearly isn't the film's stubbornly uncommunicative feral child, but - when I briefly met her last year - an articulate and rather glamorous young woman who clearly has her showbiz future sorted out. She's now living in Paris and due to appear in her first costume drama. After the interview, Luc returns to Brussels, while Jean-Pierre takes me to Seraing to show me one of their key locations - a shabby, grey bus depot where Rosetta works at a waffle van. There's not much to see - just a boarded-up pizza restaurant tucked away beneath a crumbling network of brutalist flyovers, all looking even smaller and dingier than it does on screen. Further into Seraing, Jean-Pierre points out a row of shops. Rosetta walked up the street, he explains, and Igor, hero of La Promesse, walked down it: they were just shot from different angles. A portly character in a mouldy-looking fur cap emerges from a nearby house. Jean-Pierre waits till he's gone, then explains that he was the original model for the slum landlord in La Promesse. Seraing wouldn't seem to be the most fertile terrain for a filmic fictional world, yet the Dardennes seem to have teased their entire imaginative universe out of it. There are, as they say, a million stories in the naked city - and cities don't come any more naked than this.",

      "body": "<p>At 10am, no more than a few score of us gathered in a modest cinema, grandly named Le M\u00e9li\u00e8s in Montreuil, one of those chill eastern suburbs of Paris where workers have won the right to live in cheerless concrete batteries and socialise in malls where environmental wretchedness is the architectural endowment. </p> <p>Actors, crew and some visitors were going to sit for five hours 45 minutes (bring your own sandwiches) to see a film called La Commune, in which 220 people from this and other workers' areas of Paris re-enact an experience of their forebears: the socialist Commune uprising of 1871, a nadir in French history. </p> <p>In the wake of the disastrous Franco-Prussian war, following three months of fierce defiance, of heady aspirations for justice and democracy, months of solidarity and pitiful bungling, government troops assailed the barricades and in one \"semaine sanglante\" slaughtered, street by street, more than 30,000 of their fellow countrymen and women, and children over 14. It was worse than anything in the Terror of 1793, so persistently chronicled by historians. Even today, the French education curriculum skates evasively over this event. </p> <p>The energy, conviction and skill with which the players of La Commune perform is startling; few had any previous acting experience. So genuine is the force of their passion that at moments you feel they might be about to erupt and carry the revolt live into the auditorium. </p> <p>The director is Peter Watkins, outlawed genius, accomplishing again what he achieved decades ago in Culloden and The War Game: giving a demonstration of what can be achieved when programme makers are willing to use the public as creative participants, rather than passive viewers. The only director you can compare with Watkins's working methods is Peter Brook, also exiled by negligence and resentment. In both cases, the contribution from actors is creatively nurtured, but there is never any doubt that the outcome has been forged in an individual furnace. The project was backed by funds from a number of sources, notably Sept Arte and the French Centre du Cinema. </p> <p>La Commune, while pillorying oppression (the Parisian working-class were under martial law for the following five years), also contains direct criticism of media manipulation. The events are \"covered\" by national television as if it existed at the time: once again a fastidious newscaster tells the public what is deemed desirable for it to know and in moments of crisis turns to the obligatory pundit for a supposedly civilised analysis. (Watkins put ads in the conservative Le Figaro to find people willing to give the \"royalist\" view of La Commune - and came up with, as splendid royalist stalwart, historian Fran\u00e7ois Foucart.) </p> <p>Neither does Watkins overlook left-wing oppression within the Commune; his radio reporters behind the barricade get into a dispute in reporting the banning of one of the insurgent newspapers which became too critical of the movement. Ironically the paper banned was... La Commune. </p> <p>Media manipulation and the abuse of television power are issues which have preoccupied Watkins since the banning of The War Game by the BBC in 1965. (It was eventually shown in 1985, to Watkins's indignation, marking the 40th anniversary of the Hiroshima bomb.) For 30 years, he has lectured from Australia to the US to Scandinavia on this theme. Outlawed is the appropriate word to describe the status of one of Britain's most talented film-makers, working in exile now for over 40 years. </p> <p>Watkins's crime was that he not only fell foul of the BBC but, he felt at the time, the defence establishment. We now know that, from 1954, subsequent Tory and Labour administrations were in agreement that the government would \"retain control of the manner in which the effect of nuclear weapons were made known to the public\". The BBC declared its duty not to frighten the old or very young - thereby committing itself (ironically during its most liberal period under Hugh Carleton Greene), to arms race censorship. </p> <p>Watkins's mistake was to be inflexibly principled; he carried his fight against the BBC - for whom he made the film - around the world and became regarded as unemployable by any television institution. After being deprived of its TV showing, The War Game was released as a feature film instead in the 60s. But in those years the image of Watkins as a paranoid drifter, hopelessly incapable of mature collaboration, was created and perpetuated by the the media. He moved to Scandinavia and now lives in Lithuania with his second wife. </p> <p>But how is it that a supposedly constitutionally disobliging film-maker can persuade 220 foreigners to work their guts out for months, rehearsing and performing in absurdly cramped conditions? La Commune was shot in the cramped Armand Gatti workshop at Montreuil, site of film pioneer Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s's original studio.</p> <p>And how did this supposedly rebarbative creature manage so successfully in the past with a Norwegian cast and crew (as he did for Edvard Munch in the mid-1970s). Nowadays, silence (used wonderfully in Munch) is despised; contemplativeness outlawed. The result is that museums have become one of the rare places where you can see truly responsible or artistic work - the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay in Paris is La Commune's final destination. </p> <p>Patrick Murphy, a British academic who is co-authoring with John Cook a biography of Watkins to be published next year by Manchester University Press, frequently watched Watkins at work on La Commune. \"They all work in complete unity with him,\" Murphy said. \"Cast and crew are for him and he is for them.</p> <p>\"He has a remarkable ability to communicate with the cast. He deals on a very personal level; he knows every one of them, has respect for them and this comes back through them to him. He is able to raise their awareness of the actors to a remarkably intense degree. Watkins's casts do not act in the normal sense of the word - they become. It is a remarkable experience to see him at work. This explains how he got those performances from the people in Culloden and The War Game.\" </p> <p>So where is the problem for television? Is it that ordinary people have respect for integrity, however uncomfortably inflexible, and that institutions - particularly TV, in recent years corrupting itself at vertiginous speed - simply cannot afford it? </p> <p>The BBC washed its hands of The War Game and, in a move which would rid it of responsibility but allow it to maintain that there was no real \"ban\", gave the film to the BFI. But when The War Game was nominated for an Oscar (winning the best feature length documentary award of 1967, although it only looked like a documentary), the BBC did something which would have made even Pilate blush.</p> <p>The director of BBC television, Kenneth Adam, was chosen to go to Hollywood to receive the award as he happened to be a governor of the BFI too. It is long forgotten that by 1967, Watkins, who made Culloden at the age of 29, was regarded as the new Orson Welles of the film world and had showbusiness friends throughout the world. He rang his pal Elizabeth Taylor and asked her to circumvent the BBC and pick up the award for him. </p> <p>I can personally attest to the permanence of the BBC's vindictive attitude towards Watkins. In 1975, he made Edvard Munch, for Norwegian and Swedish television. This four-hour film of extraordinary beauty is a work of startling originality in narrative structure, in use of colour, sound and hugely confident deployment of non-professionals. Watkins's film is perhaps the most persuasive depiction of the artistic process; of an artist's inner anguish and of the environment which haunts, torments and nurtures him that has ever been screened. In other words it is a work of genius, far beyond the modest War Game. </p> <p>In 1976 the BBC, which at least had the gumption to recognise its worth, bought it and gave it a champagne launch. Senior BBC executives fronted the press reception with an absurdly proprietorial air (although the corporation had put nothing into the production). As television critic of The Sunday Times at the time, I expressed my admiration for the work to one of the corporation's most senior executives. But even as the champagne bubbled for what took on the aspect of some kind of BBC cultural triumph, one senior executive at least had a more pressing task: to convince me of what a totally untrustworthy and impossible creature Watkins was. Nine years after the banning, revenge still dripped from every corporate word. </p> <p>It is futile to pretend that Peter Watkins handles the media well. It took months to establish enough trust for him to agree to any meeting. When we met in a Montreuil cafe one Sunday he was wary, rather rigid and given to a kind of managerial tetchiness, ready to abandon the interview on the spot if I appeared to be straying from what he considered (mostly rightly) to be essential issues. But there is a detectable vulnerability in his unsubtle attempts to protect himself - and even a hint that if he could only trust you, the media, as he does his cast and crew, the relationship could be quite different. At one point he made it clear that, even aged 65, exile was still painful for him. </p> <p>The media slaughtered Privilege, his sci-fi parable starring Paul Jones as a pop star who becomes a vessel for social control, which he made just a year after The War Game. Despite two years of work, the Swedish Film Institute pulled the plug on his almost-complete Strindberg. When the BFI gave it a single showing some years ago, they refused to introduce him to the audience. Contrary to its usual practice, the Halliwell guide makes no mention of the Oscar for The War Game in the 70s and 80s editions of either the Television or Film Companions. It's enough to make you paranoid. </p> <p>Watkins admits that he is \"a product of the British educational system\" - educated at Brecon, a small public school in Wales, although his family is English. \"But, thank God, I had no university education. Instead I went to drama school.\" </p> <p>There is an extraordinary consistency in his development. While doing military service (\"I did not intend to point my rifle at a human being\") at Canterbury, he made his first film, Forgotten Faces, a 20-minute model of what was to come. He recreated the Budapest uprising in the back streets of Canterbury, with locals and a couple of Hungarians. It won him the top Amateur Cin\u00e9 Camera Award (\"A very nice object depicting a hand-cranked camera.\") This got him a job as PA and then programme-maker at the BBC. </p> <p>A few years later he was defiantly going around the world showing The War Game in schools, colleges, public meetings. </p> <p>\"But you did not have copyright,\" I said, \"How did you get a print?\" </p> <p>\"I don't play the game entirely by the rules of the BBC establishment,\" he said. \"What could the BBC do - send in the police in Australia or America? They were too embarrassed to deal with me physically.\" </p> <p>There is a glimpse here of why television companies find him intimidating. </p> <p>But Watkins insists that the BBC \"must not be made an Aunt Sally\". CBS, NBC, all the big television institutions are equally at fault, as is \"so-called community television\". </p> <p>\"The discussion about my position must be in a broader context,\" he said. \"Not just about somebody who produced a film on nuclear weapons which was squashed. Basically I am someone who has been working for 30 years to help shift the power balance between public and TV. The crisis is so severe in television.\" </p> <p>\"On the basis of what?\" </p> <p>\"Everything.\" </p> <p>\"Financial? Political?...\"</p> <p>\"Go on,\" he said, his smile getting tighter. \"Any word you care to use.\" </p> <p>\"Cultural?\" </p> <p>\"Creative?\" he suggested. \"Moral?\" </p> <p>\"I have no doubt,\" Watkins continued, \"that had TV taken an alternative direction during the 1960s and 1970s and worked in a more open way, global society today would be vastly more humane and just.\" </p> <p>His thesis, which few honest citizens can quarrel with, is that there has been an \"accumulation of global media power with no accountability that is not only not being challenged but is not even being debated\". </p> <p>\"Dennis Potter is dead,\" he concludes. \"The people who were once able to work critically within the media have been marginalised.\"</p> <p>\u0095 La Commune will premiere at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris, on March 13, and will run at least until March 25.</p>",

The director of BBC television, Kenneth Adam, was chosen to go to Hollywood to receive the award as he happened to be a governor of the BFI too. It is long forgotten that by 1967, Watkins, who made Culloden at the age of 29, was regarded as the new Orson Welles of the film world and had showbusiness friends throughout the world. He rang his pal Elizabeth Taylor and asked her to circumvent the BBC and pick up the award for him. I can personally attest to the permanence of the BBC's vindictive attitude towards Watkins. In 1975, he made Edvard Munch, for Norwegian and Swedish television. This four-hour film of extraordinary beauty is a work of startling originality in narrative structure, in use of colour, sound and hugely confident deployment of non-professionals. Watkins's film is perhaps the most persuasive depiction of the artistic process; of an artist's inner anguish and of the environment which haunts, torments and nurtures him that has ever been screened. In other words it is a work of genius, far beyond the modest War Game. In 1976 the BBC, which at least had the gumption to recognise its worth, bought it and gave it a champagne launch. Senior BBC executives fronted the press reception with an absurdly proprietorial air (although the corporation had put nothing into the production). As television critic of The Sunday Times at the time, I expressed my admiration for the work to one of the corporation's most senior executives. But even as the champagne bubbled for what took on the aspect of some kind of BBC cultural triumph, one senior executive at least had a more pressing task: to convince me of what a totally untrustworthy and impossible creature Watkins was. Nine years after the banning, revenge still dripped from every corporate word. It is futile to pretend that Peter Watkins handles the media well. It took months to establish enough trust for him to agree to any meeting. When we met in a Montreuil cafe one Sunday he was wary, rather rigid and given to a kind of managerial tetchiness, ready to abandon the interview on the spot if I appeared to be straying from what he considered (mostly rightly) to be essential issues. But there is a detectable vulnerability in his unsubtle attempts to protect himself - and even a hint that if he could only trust you, the media, as he does his cast and crew, the relationship could be quite different. At one point he made it clear that, even aged 65, exile was still painful for him. The media slaughtered Privilege, his sci-fi parable starring Paul Jones as a pop star who becomes a vessel for social control, which he made just a year after The War Game. Despite two years of work, the Swedish Film Institute pulled the plug on his almost-complete Strindberg. When the BFI gave it a single showing some years ago, they refused to introduce him to the audience. Contrary to its usual practice, the Halliwell guide makes no mention of the Oscar for The War Game in the 70s and 80s editions of either the Television or Film Companions. It's enough to make you paranoid. Watkins admits that he is \"a product of the British educational system\" - educated at Brecon, a small public school in Wales, although his family is English. \"But, thank God, I had no university education. Instead I went to drama school.\" There is an extraordinary consistency in his development. While doing military service (\"I did not intend to point my rifle at a human being\") at Canterbury, he made his first film, Forgotten Faces, a 20-minute model of what was to come. He recreated the Budapest uprising in the back streets of Canterbury, with locals and a couple of Hungarians. It won him the top Amateur Cin\u00e9 Camera Award (\"A very nice object depicting a hand-cranked camera.\") This got him a job as PA and then programme-maker at the BBC. A few years later he was defiantly going around the world showing The War Game in schools, colleges, public meetings. \"But you did not have copyright,\" I said, \"How did you get a print?\" \"I don't play the game entirely by the rules of the BBC establishment,\" he said. \"What could the BBC do - send in the police in Australia or America? They were too embarrassed to deal with me physically.\" There is a glimpse here of why television companies find him intimidating. But Watkins insists that the BBC \"must not be made an Aunt Sally\". CBS, NBC, all the big television institutions are equally at fault, as is \"so-called community television\". \"The discussion about my position must be in a broader context,\" he said. \"Not just about somebody who produced a film on nuclear weapons which was squashed. Basically I am someone who has been working for 30 years to help shift the power balance between public and TV. The crisis is so severe in television.\" \"On the basis of what?\" \"Everything.\" \"Financial? Political?...\" \"Go on,\" he said, his smile getting tighter. \"Any word you care to use.\" \"Cultural?\" \"Creative?\" he suggested. \"Moral?\" \"I have no doubt,\" Watkins continued, \"that had TV taken an alternative direction during the 1960s and 1970s and worked in a more open way, global society today would be vastly more humane and just.\" His thesis, which few honest citizens can quarrel with, is that there has been an \"accumulation of global media power with no accountability that is not only not being challenged but is not even being debated\". \"Dennis Potter is dead,\" he concludes. \"The people who were once able to work critically within the media have been marginalised.\" \u0095 La Commune will premiere at the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, Paris, on March 13, and will run at least until March 25.",

      "body": "<p>Show Me Love is a really terrific film from Sweden which has outgrossed all the US competition, including Titanic, in Scandinavia. Like Festen (shot entirely on a domestic digital video camera) it is part of a refreshing re-emergence of Scandinavia. It is not a Dogme film, though. It was shot on Super 16mm with a small budget and lots of inexperienced teenage actors and it really crackles with life and energy. As such it falls into a genre of Swedish youth movies. The plot is very simple and not particularly original except that here two teenage girls are in love with each other rather than the conventional boy and girl stuff. </p> <p>Both this film and Festen are better than any other film I have seen in recent years. They are certainly better than anything in the Oscars this year and last year. On every level of film excellence - writing, acting, directing, cinematography and editing - they were superior to those big overblown films with their overblown vistas and production values and over-sentimentalised morals. I urge everyone who likes good film-making to go and see this film. Like I said, it's just my opinion that this is a good film, but I am a film-maker fascinated by the emergence of small films such as The Blair Witch Project and the Dogme films and my own efforts over the last six years. </p> <p>I prefer small films and rarely get excited by big, expensive films. I feel shut out of big films, as if I am not being asked to participate in the event. It would be true to say that I feel the same about big theatre and big music. There comes a point where you know you are being manipulated by tricks rather than connecting with emotions and ideas and truths. It is much harder to tell the truth to a lot of people than a few. Glenn Gould retreated into the recording studio rather than play the big concert halls. It is a bald fact that bigger means more expensive to produce - as soon as you cross that line, you have to make compromises. </p> <p>It is very difficult to sell foreign-language films in America and Britain. Audiences are not used to making that much effort because they have become accustomed to the idea that a film is there to entertain them and that their role is essentially passive. What a sad state of affairs that is. Film is something that can be so involving.</p> <p>I was in LA when Show Me Love was released. I do not know a single person who went to see the film despite some good reviews and I think it got stuck in the gay film circuit. I hope the same thing does not happen in Britain. I wonder how many prints have been struck. I wonder how much they will spend on advertising. </p> <p>My last released film, The Loss of Sexual Innocence, has two prints for the entire UK, no poster and managed to hang on in two cinemas in London for a couple of weeks before setting off on a tour of the rest of the UK. Reviews were either terrible or very good. The film took 17 years to make it to the screen and involved complex deals with foreign distributors to get its relatively small budget together.</p> <p>The same was true of my next film, Miss Julie. Neither film has any British money behind it. A healthy revolution is taking place and I'm pleased to have been a small part of it. I've been urging the use of 16mm for some years now and have just shot a feature on video, so I am aware of the problems that exist within the industry. The biggest challenge now is not shooting the film for a small budget, but getting it seen, getting distribution. </p> <p>The problem is the studio system. And it isn't possible to talk about these new, interesting, smaller films without acknowledging this context that all films still have to function within. There is no conspiracy, nothing as smart as that. It's just that the studio system is a vast pyramid that has executives at the top and beneath them thousands of film people who deal with the plethora of junk that comes with a studio film.</p> <p>Vast rental houses provide equipment to make the films. Very expensive stuff: cranes and Steadicams and gadgets by the thousand. Every year they make this equipment even more complex. And if you make a studio film, you should be using this stuff. In the film business, which is male-dominated, there is a macho attitude about equipment. Many times I have heard directors talk about the fact that they like to make commercials because they get to use all the new equipment. Consequently the style of film-making came to be influenced by the style of commercials. Many British directors have made their mark this way. </p> <p>After Leaving Las Vegas came out, I heard on the grapevine that the camera rental companies were pissed off because new film-makers wanted to try Super 16 cameras and they had invested in 35mm. People make such a good living in this business that the idea of shooting a low-budget film because you want to is heresy. </p> <p>But the biggest problem with studio films is that they are not good enough any more. And the reason they are not good enough is because they cannot trust the individual vision of the film-maker. There is simply too much money at stake. An interesting date is the day Fatal Attraction was tested in front of an invited audience. As a result of that test the ending was re-shot and the film was a huge hit. This proved... whatever the studio wanted it to prove. The theory now is that any film can be fixed by spending money on it. And very few execs will have the courage to back a film that is not right in the middle of the taste-buds of an average audience. It is far simpler to say no than to say yes to an idea. </p> <p>I will not labour the point here but it is impossible to talk about the emergence of the new, smaller, cheaper cinema without putting it into the context of the studio system. All the fat and waste of the studios is dragging down the art of story-telling for obvious reasons. It is quite natural, therefore that groups of film-makers with good ideas might want to do it a different way, a way that gives them some freedom and control. But the real revolution has to be a reappraisal of the way in which films are distributed. British cinema is saturated by the American product and it is very difficult to hold a cinema for more than a couple of weeks with a small film. It would be interesting to know how the Swedes managed to do so well with Show Me Love. </p> <p>There is much interest in the Dogme movement. Most actors and younger directors have been influenced by it and everyone talks of wanting to do it Dogme style. This will inevitably produce a lot of bad films, but that is OK. But Dogme is also in danger of becoming a semi-religious cult. There is nothing like a set of rules to get everyone excited.</p> <p>My impression is that Lars von Trier and his mates did it as a bit of a serious joke, never thinking that it would take hold of the aspiring film-makers' imagination in the way that it has. My sense is that they wanted to make films with a strong individualism. There is nothing new in any of this. The French new wave, British 60s cinema, Cassavetes and Pennebaker, Ken Loach have consistently produced fine cinema. But they were considered to be on the fringe and when a small film had a success it was never seen as an indication of public taste changing, merely as a one-off. The problem always came back to distribution, or lack of it. </p> <p>Add to this the way films are reviewed. With the exception of this publication and perhaps one or two others, a film such as Festen or Show Me Love will not get much notice. Even a really bad review of an American studio film will get a main photo and first place on the film review page.</p> <p>Why is this? It's surely not a conspiracy, but the fact is that we get most of our information about new films from newspapers and magazines, which must compete in a free market, and most of the time they opt for a generic product. Film and sport stars and supermodels all rate the same. All that is about to change. The days of critics as we know them are numbered. The internet will offer a better choice - yet another aspect of the digital revolution that very few of us saw coming: their job function is no longer secure. </p> <p>The advent of the digital video camera is going to have such a far-reaching effect on the film business. I've been in LA for the last month and I am very aware of how nervous the studio people are. Job security is a huge issue. The idea that all those big machines and trucks and equipment may suddenly be out of date is deeply worrying to many of them. There is much talk about loss of quality, and the erosion of standards, and how film is such a complex and deeply complicated business that it can't be entrusted to any old Tom, Dick or Harry. </p> <p>But the truth is that it is no longer that difficult to make a film. One cheap camera and a laptop will get you there. This will open the doors to so many great artists who would certainly have been denied the opportunity five years ago. Film has been such an elite occupation for so long, it is going to be very difficult for some of the old guard to deal with this influx of lower-caste geniuses. But it is far too important a medium to allow it to continue in this tired fashion. Film-making belongs to the people and it is high time they took it back from the bankers.</p> <p>\u0095 Show Me Love is released on March 3.</p> <p>\u0095 Mike Figgis is finishing <a href=\"http://www.timecode2000.com\">Timecode 2000</a>.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>En route to Ice Cube's hotel, I had his 1992 album The Predator on my Walkman. It made a strange accompaniment to the stroll down Park Lane. Then again, Ice Cube records weren't made for trips to the Dorchester. They were made for Compton, Inglewood, Long Beach and South Central. And, much to the chagrin of countless suburban (read white) US parents, for well-appointed teenage bedrooms from Maine to the Pacific. </p> <p>Because Ice Cube records were made by the self-styled Nigga Ya Love To Hate, founder member of seminal gangsta rappers Niggaz Wit' Attitude, whose solo career later chronicled a decade of crisis for urban (read black) America; a decade of Rodney King, LA riots, gangs, crack and OJ Simpson. But they were also made by the affable 30-year-old film star and entrepreneur sitting opposite me, sipping Evian in a PR suite while a make-up artist hovers outside (\"just a little powder, man\"). With two movies and an NWA reunion on the way, Ice Cube has business to discuss. </p> <p>In fact, he's barely shaken hands before he's on to his role in Three Kings, indie luminary David O Russell's inspired account of a gaggle of US troops causing havoc amid the detritus of the Gulf War. Stretching out in his seat, he admits his involvement owed less to his enthusiasm for Russell's previous films, Spanking the Monkey and Flirting With Disaster (neither of which he's seen), than for sharing agents with co-star George Clooney. \"And even then,\" he explains, \"I wasn't sure about it. Wasn't sure at all. Because it's offbeat, it's not your typical... movie. But once David O Russell explained what he wanted to make then, yeah, I was cool with it.\" </p> <p>It's hardly surprising: the stylish absurdity of Three Kings provides him with easily his best screen vehicle since his debut, John Singleton's mordant 1989 gang drama, Boyz N The Hood (although, to be honest, the likes of Anaconda don't offer much competition). The only irony comes from his playing a grunt. After all, when George Bush was dropping smart bombs on Baghdad, Ice Cube was Amerikkka's Most Wanted; the title of his first solo album proved prophetic when his name subsequently appeared on a far-right death list.</p> <p>He beams serenely at the memory. \"You know, it's funny, 'cause if you asked me back in '91 would I ever be in a movie as a soldier, a US soldier, I'd have said get the hell out of here. Hell no! But that's what I like about the film - we showed there were a lot of people on both sides who really didn't want to be there.\" </p> <p>Indeed, other than its freewheeling comic swagger, Three Kings' most startling aspect is its willingness to point the finger at both Saddam and the White House. Presumably that cold-eyed pragmatism appealed to him? \"Oh yeah,\" he responds. \"Of course. I love any time you can enlighten people to mistakes, that's how I started my career. It definitely turned me on. Plus I like the interaction of the soldiers and the Shi'ite Muslims.\" </p> <p>As he's raised the subject, I ask whether - having converted in the early 90s - he's still Muslim himself. \"Yeah. Oh yeah.\" And still involved with the Nation of Islam, the militant faction he once called \"the best place for any young black male\"? This time he hesitates. \"Ah, when you say involved with the Nation, it's tricky. I never was in the Nation of Islam... I mean, what I call myself is a natural Muslim, 'cause it's just me and God. You know, going to the mosque, the ritual and the tradition, it's just not in me to do. So I don't do it.\" </p> <p>Although he's entirely gracious about it, something in his manner suggests now isn't the time to go into the small print of his relationship with Islam. Instead, we turn to his status as an ascendant multimedia potentate. Describing his movie career as \"opportunistic\", he happily admits the film gigs are part of a bigger game plan. For example, having seen his 1998 directorial debut - the ambitious if confused The Players Club - perform disappointingly, a follow-up depends on \"getting my name a little bigger through acting, so next time I direct, it'll come out a little stronger\". </p> <p>Then there's Cubevision, the film production company recently established to accessorise his existing music set-up, Street Knowledge. \"Cubevision is there to develop the shit that other people are shaky on,\" he muses. \"Raw shit, ideas from the street. When people see the Cubevision logo, they should know it's something good, something worth checking out.\" </p> <p>What it also does, of course, is grant him autonomy from the studios. Prior to The Players Club, three of his pitches were unceremoniously bounced around Hollywood's executive suites before disappearing over the horizon. He nods enthusiastically.</p> <p>\"And now I would never rely on the studio system. Because their system is too goddamn fickle. Executives get fired, executives get hired, and you don't even know if your guy is gonna be there when the movie's done. Or is another cat gonna come in and say 'What? I don't want this'? Man, I went through that, and I vowed I'd never do it again.

It's interesting for three reasons. The first lies in the film's temperament: a relentlessly crass but wholly congenial comedy - wherein the leading man returns as uber-homie Craig, now ensconced in the SoCal suburbs - whose prevailing themes (family is good, bullies get their comeuppance) could have come straight out of the Eisenhower 1950s.</p> <p>It may be enveloped in a haze of blunt smoke, but that's about its only connection with the casually atavistic world of Boyz N The Hood. \"Well,\" he shrugs, \"that's the many faces of Ice Cube.

Well, that's on the soundtrack: a classic slab of bellicose West Coast hip-hop, it's called Chin Check and it marks the return of NWA, the hugely influential group Ice Cube quit in 1989 over an exponentially bitter business dispute; without him, NWA stumbled to a halt two years and one shoddy album later. </p> <p>Now, however, a summer stadium tour and more recording await, with the peerlessly nasal Snoop Doggy Dogg drafted in to replace the late Eazy E.

Then the self-assurance re-enters his voice: \" 'Cause everyone knows that the album's gonna be the big record.\" </p> <p>It will, both because of the nostalgia invoked by the memory of their brutally anthemic debut, Straight Outta Compton, and their post-split legacy (chiefly the solo work of Cube and fellow member Dr Dre, inspiration for rap's pre-eminent late 90s G-Funk sound). When he refers to his group as\"hip-hop royalty\", it doesn't come across as merely the hyperbole of a man with something to sell. </p> <p>But why, when none of the interested parties can need the money, get back together now? \"We were tired of talking about it,\" comes the response. \"For years, every time we'd see each other we'd be like 'You know what we should do?

Yet he must be aware there's a lot of baggage involved: the shadow cast by Eazy's Aids-related death, their involvement with deeply unsavoury music mogul (and current resident of the federal California Men's Colony) Suge Knight, the spat over money still vexatious enough for Cube to declare \"fuck [former manager] Jerry Heller\" on Chin Check... </p> <p>\"Aw no, that doesn't bother me,\" he replies. \"History is history, there's no point trying to get away from that.

      "bodyText": "En route to Ice Cube's hotel, I had his 1992 album The Predator on my Walkman. It made a strange accompaniment to the stroll down Park Lane. Then again, Ice Cube records weren't made for trips to the Dorchester. They were made for Compton, Inglewood, Long Beach and South Central. And, much to the chagrin of countless suburban (read white) US parents, for well-appointed teenage bedrooms from Maine to the Pacific. Because Ice Cube records were made by the self-styled Nigga Ya Love To Hate, founder member of seminal gangsta rappers Niggaz Wit' Attitude, whose solo career later chronicled a decade of crisis for urban (read black) America; a decade of Rodney King, LA riots, gangs, crack and OJ Simpson. But they were also made by the affable 30-year-old film star and entrepreneur sitting opposite me, sipping Evian in a PR suite while a make-up artist hovers outside (\"just a little powder, man\"). With two movies and an NWA reunion on the way, Ice Cube has business to discuss. In fact, he's barely shaken hands before he's on to his role in Three Kings, indie luminary David O Russell's inspired account of a gaggle of US troops causing havoc amid the detritus of the Gulf War. Stretching out in his seat, he admits his involvement owed less to his enthusiasm for Russell's previous films, Spanking the Monkey and Flirting With Disaster (neither of which he's seen), than for sharing agents with co-star George Clooney. \"And even then,\" he explains, \"I wasn't sure about it. Wasn't sure at all. Because it's offbeat, it's not your typical... movie. But once David O Russell explained what he wanted to make then, yeah, I was cool with it.\" It's hardly surprising: the stylish absurdity of Three Kings provides him with easily his best screen vehicle since his debut, John Singleton's mordant 1989 gang drama, Boyz N The Hood (although, to be honest, the likes of Anaconda don't offer much competition). The only irony comes from his playing a grunt. After all, when George Bush was dropping smart bombs on Baghdad, Ice Cube was Amerikkka's Most Wanted; the title of his first solo album proved prophetic when his name subsequently appeared on a far-right death list. He beams serenely at the memory. \"You know, it's funny, 'cause if you asked me back in '91 would I ever be in a movie as a soldier, a US soldier, I'd have said get the hell out of here. Hell no! But that's what I like about the film - we showed there were a lot of people on both sides who really didn't want to be there.\" Indeed, other than its freewheeling comic swagger, Three Kings' most startling aspect is its willingness to point the finger at both Saddam and the White House. Presumably that cold-eyed pragmatism appealed to him? \"Oh yeah,\" he responds. \"Of course. I love any time you can enlighten people to mistakes, that's how I started my career. It definitely turned me on. Plus I like the interaction of the soldiers and the Shi'ite Muslims.\" As he's raised the subject, I ask whether - having converted in the early 90s - he's still Muslim himself. \"Yeah. Oh yeah.\" And still involved with the Nation of Islam, the militant faction he once called \"the best place for any young black male\"? This time he hesitates. \"Ah, when you say involved with the Nation, it's tricky. I never was in the Nation of Islam... I mean, what I call myself is a natural Muslim, 'cause it's just me and God. You know, going to the mosque, the ritual and the tradition, it's just not in me to do. So I don't do it.\" Although he's entirely gracious about it, something in his manner suggests now isn't the time to go into the small print of his relationship with Islam. Instead, we turn to his status as an ascendant multimedia potentate. Describing his movie career as \"opportunistic\", he happily admits the film gigs are part of a bigger game plan. For example, having seen his 1998 directorial debut - the ambitious if confused The Players Club - perform disappointingly, a follow-up depends on \"getting my name a little bigger through acting, so next time I direct, it'll come out a little stronger\". Then there's Cubevision, the film production company recently established to accessorise his existing music set-up, Street Knowledge. \"Cubevision is there to develop the shit that other people are shaky on,\" he muses. \"Raw shit, ideas from the street. When people see the Cubevision logo, they should know it's something good, something worth checking out.\" What it also does, of course, is grant him autonomy from the studios. Prior to The Players Club, three of his pitches were unceremoniously bounced around Hollywood's executive suites before disappearing over the horizon. He nods enthusiastically. \"And now I would never rely on the studio system. Because their system is too goddamn fickle. Executives get fired, executives get hired, and you don't even know if your guy is gonna be there when the movie's done. Or is another cat gonna come in and say 'What? I don't want this'? Man, I went through that, and I vowed I'd never do it again. That's why I'm intent on bringing my own shit into the movie house.\" Which leads on to Next Friday (the sequel, unsurprisingly, to 1995's Friday), his other imminent release, in which he takes on the triple-header role of producer, screenwriter and star.

      "body": "<p>Nothing indicts this year's Oscar list more than the omission of Rosetta from the list of nominees for best foreign film. For the stupidity and ignorance of this oversight, the constituent members of the \"Academy\" deserve to have their ears nailed to the bumpers of their hired limos. Because this film, a deserving winner of the Palme d'Or at Cannes, is a stunning and remarkable achievement. </p> <p>Written and directed by Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardennes, using mostly one hand-held camera, and without a musical score, Rosetta is broadly in the tradition of Bresson's Mouchette and Fellini's Nights of Cabiria: an uncompromising depiction of real poverty and the terrible gravitational pull of ennui and despair that this exerts. It is also a luminous and compassionate account of a young woman struggling to climb out of the swamp of want: by turns furious, frustrated, and strangely impassive. </p> <p>Emilie Dequenne is the 18-year-old non-professional that the Dardennes brothers discovered to carry the burden of this film, and what an astounding discovery she is: we have 90 minutes in which she is rarely out of shot, and often in the most searching close-up, the camera recording every flinch, every grimace, and - in one very moving moment - her single, radiantly beautiful smile. It is one of the most extraordinary, unselfconscious performances in the cinema at present, and Dequenne makes most \"acting\", with its tinpot cliches of gesture and hand-me-down inanities, look very paltry indeed. </p> <p>Rosetta lives with her slatternly, alcoholic mother on a Belgian caravan site and burns with nothing more than a desire for what the bourgeoisie take for granted: a regular job, a regular life. She gets by on a sort of tinker existence, selling second-hand clothes that her mother mends in rare moments of sobriety. But even the dire blue-collar jobs she wants are in short supply; the scent of her angry desperation repels nervous managers and she always returns to the arena of her domestic shame. This is the terrible trailer-park where her mute mother, catatonic with drink and self-loathing, exemplifies the dizzying abyss of futility over which Rosetta now finds herself teetering. </p> <p>This picture focuses with cold, resolute clarity on what poverty means. It finds its locations in both the town and in a kind of degraded pastoral: Rosetta is expelled from the grisly Edens of shop and factory work and has to scrape an existence poaching on a riverbank accessed through a torn fence: trapping fish in broken bottles. </p> <p>The material detail of all this is conveyed with compelling neutrality, and with a subtlety that rewards repeat viewings. It was only when I watched it for a second time that I noticed that Rosetta appears to have had her mother customise the apron she wears as a saleswoman on a waffle stand: the word \"Rosetta\" is tinily embroidered. How she loves that terrible job. Discharging its obligations looks like a living death, but to Rosetta it is a badge of human dignity, of existence, worth doing anything for, including a terrible act of betrayal against Riquet (Fabrizio Rongione), a boy who is clearly in love with her. </p> <p>The Dardennes' camera is always there, jogging alongside Rosetta as she grimly walks everywhere, rarely or never able to afford the bus. It peeps warily around corners, the way Rosetta does; it is breathlessly at her side, like an anxious child or nervy younger sibling, concerned at all times to keep Rosetta's face in plain view. It may whip-pan round, nervously to confront whatever deceitful man is standing in Rosetta's way, but always swings compulsively back to Rosetta's face like a compass needle. </p> <p>Often she and it are on the run. Rosetta is always running: running like a devastated child from employers who are taking her job away, running to catch her truant mother, running away from Riquet. And the camera scrambles after her, seeming to join in with the desperate and demeaning grapple that invariably ensues. There is an element of absurdity here, almost farce, but the effect is one of pathos, rather than black comedy: Rosetta is still struggling and has not collapsed into despair. </p> <p>There is a clarity and severity in this film that takes it beyond an Anglo-Saxon realm of social realism or miserabilism: this is a film with a rigorous transforming gaze, a strange and passionate urgency. Every time I watch it, it becomes more moving, more commanding, more exceptional. It is a film whose grace and lyricism has earned it, simply, the status of classic: something of real greatness.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The Presidents' Day long weekend is Hollywood's equinox, a short period in which you become totally disoriented by what's suddenly on the nation's screens. The future and the recent past seem simultaneously to jostle for our attention.</p> <p>Last weekend was the last chance for all the stale old Christmas and New Year movies before they were retired to make room for the first wave of spring contenders. This week it's the turn of several mid-budget tragicomedies, \"dramedies\" and other ill-conceived generic hybrids no less abominable in conception than they were execrable in execution.</p> <p>In the same week, one opens the LA Times and finds the suddenly double-thick issues smeared with dozens of full-page ads for all the movies that have been nominated for Academy awards. In the case of the movies that garnered the most nominations, the ads are accompanied by national re-release campaigns to cash in on the intensive Oscar coverage.</p> <p>This is one of the reasons there were no big-budget studio releases this weekend, no Godzillas, no ID4s. No one wants to risk a big release when attention is elsewhere. For bombast and brainlessness we must wait until Memorial Day in May.</p> <p>Among the newcomers, we were favoured with a tie at the top between Hanging Up, the latest date-movie from the profoundly tiresome Ephron sisters, Nora and Delia, and the latest Bruce Willis movie, a hit-man comedy called The Whole Nine Yards, co-starring Matthew Perry.</p> <p>This, believe it or not, is the third Willis movie since The Sixth Sense was released in the summer. First came Alan Rudolph's Breakfast of Champions, which did zero business, although it only got made because of Willis's involvement - proof of his occasionally excellent taste. The next, simpering family drama The Story of Us, was adequate proof that, on his bad days, Willis has the tastebuds of a meths connoisseur.</p> <p>The Ephron sisters have yet to overcome their pathological urge to cast the irksomely ditzy, rinky-dink Meg Ryan in everything they write or direct. We've had Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail, both of which were several leagues the other side of nauseating, and now we have Hanging Up, the story of three sisters - Ryan, Diane Keaton, Lisa Kudrow - and their randy old single dad, played by Walter Matthau, apparently on day-release from Grumpier Old Men or The Odd Couple 2.</p> <p>Men who took their dates to see Scream 3 a fortnight ago paid for it this week as they were dragged screaming to endure Hanging Up, which I'm pleased to see earned a 21-toilet-flush salute of rancid reviews.</p> <p>The Whole Nine Yards was better received by the critics. It plays to Willis's strengths, his geniality and tough-guy image, and leaves the clowning and the pratfalls to second-billed Matthew Perry. Perry is playing Chandler Bing yet again, with only the merest variations, but it's a good turn wherever he does it, so no one complained.</p> <p>Natasha Henstridge fans (and yes, I mean you, the spotty youths in rows four and five holding your Game Boys under your desks) will be pleased to note her cameo as Willis's estranged wife, and disappointed to learn that she remains fully clad throughout the movie. I can hear them wailing now, \"But full-frontal nudity's the whole point of Natasha Henstridge! Waaah!\"</p> <p>Elsewhere there was the kiddie comedy Snow Day at number three, competing for the under-nines market alongside Disney's The Tigger Movie. The big movies of last week saw disastrous drop-offs in attendance. Scream 3, which was number one for two weeks, fell to number six, and Leonardo DiCaprio's anaemic comeback The Beach washed up at number seven.</p> <p>\"It's a dark movie,\" claimed Fox's distribution chieftain Tom Sherak by way of explanation. No, Tom. Clean, Shaven is a dark movie. Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is a dark movie. The Beach is a dork movie, a lightweight movie, and it got the kicking it deserved.</p> <p>Which left the Oscar race re-issues to fill out the bottom of the chart. The Green Mile and The Cider House Rules tied at number 10, and American Beauty rose from number 59 to number nine. This is good news for a rather good movie, but is less surprising when you learn that last week it was in only seven cinemas, and this week it's in 1,287.</p> <p>I confess a total lack of interest in the whole Oscar process. It occupies the first three months of the year in LA, a dark spell that resembles the depressing period after the clocks go back in the autumn. The papers are clogged with the many award ceremonies that precede the Oscars: the Golden Globes, the New York Critics Association, its LA equivalent, followed by all the different guilds within the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, directors, writers, actors, and so on.</p> <p>Then the hacks weigh in to handicap the race, we get endless boring behind-the-ceremony features, and the usual nonsense about dresses, hairdos and what big rock Shazza's gonna wear. A long time ago Oscar night was a good excuse for an at-home knees-up, 20 drunks in a suburban living-room all screaming at the TV as Dances With Wolves beats GoodFellas for best picture.

      "bodyText": "The Presidents' Day long weekend is Hollywood's equinox, a short period in which you become totally disoriented by what's suddenly on the nation's screens. The future and the recent past seem simultaneously to jostle for our attention. Last weekend was the last chance for all the stale old Christmas and New Year movies before they were retired to make room for the first wave of spring contenders. This week it's the turn of several mid-budget tragicomedies, \"dramedies\" and other ill-conceived generic hybrids no less abominable in conception than they were execrable in execution. In the same week, one opens the LA Times and finds the suddenly double-thick issues smeared with dozens of full-page ads for all the movies that have been nominated for Academy awards. In the case of the movies that garnered the most nominations, the ads are accompanied by national re-release campaigns to cash in on the intensive Oscar coverage. This is one of the reasons there were no big-budget studio releases this weekend, no Godzillas, no ID4s. No one wants to risk a big release when attention is elsewhere. For bombast and brainlessness we must wait until Memorial Day in May. Among the newcomers, we were favoured with a tie at the top between Hanging Up, the latest date-movie from the profoundly tiresome Ephron sisters, Nora and Delia, and the latest Bruce Willis movie, a hit-man comedy called The Whole Nine Yards, co-starring Matthew Perry. This, believe it or not, is the third Willis movie since The Sixth Sense was released in the summer. First came Alan Rudolph's Breakfast of Champions, which did zero business, although it only got made because of Willis's involvement - proof of his occasionally excellent taste. The next, simpering family drama The Story of Us, was adequate proof that, on his bad days, Willis has the tastebuds of a meths connoisseur. The Ephron sisters have yet to overcome their pathological urge to cast the irksomely ditzy, rinky-dink Meg Ryan in everything they write or direct. We've had Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail, both of which were several leagues the other side of nauseating, and now we have Hanging Up, the story of three sisters - Ryan, Diane Keaton, Lisa Kudrow - and their randy old single dad, played by Walter Matthau, apparently on day-release from Grumpier Old Men or The Odd Couple 2. Men who took their dates to see Scream 3 a fortnight ago paid for it this week as they were dragged screaming to endure Hanging Up, which I'm pleased to see earned a 21-toilet-flush salute of rancid reviews. The Whole Nine Yards was better received by the critics. It plays to Willis's strengths, his geniality and tough-guy image, and leaves the clowning and the pratfalls to second-billed Matthew Perry. Perry is playing Chandler Bing yet again, with only the merest variations, but it's a good turn wherever he does it, so no one complained. Natasha Henstridge fans (and yes, I mean you, the spotty youths in rows four and five holding your Game Boys under your desks) will be pleased to note her cameo as Willis's estranged wife, and disappointed to learn that she remains fully clad throughout the movie. I can hear them wailing now, \"But full-frontal nudity's the whole point of Natasha Henstridge! Waaah!\" Elsewhere there was the kiddie comedy Snow Day at number three, competing for the under-nines market alongside Disney's The Tigger Movie. The big movies of last week saw disastrous drop-offs in attendance. Scream 3, which was number one for two weeks, fell to number six, and Leonardo DiCaprio's anaemic comeback The Beach washed up at number seven. \"It's a dark movie,\" claimed Fox's distribution chieftain Tom Sherak by way of explanation. No, Tom. Clean, Shaven is a dark movie. Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is a dark movie. The Beach is a dork movie, a lightweight movie, and it got the kicking it deserved. Which left the Oscar race re-issues to fill out the bottom of the chart. The Green Mile and The Cider House Rules tied at number 10, and American Beauty rose from number 59 to number nine. This is good news for a rather good movie, but is less surprising when you learn that last week it was in only seven cinemas, and this week it's in 1,287. I confess a total lack of interest in the whole Oscar process. It occupies the first three months of the year in LA, a dark spell that resembles the depressing period after the clocks go back in the autumn. The papers are clogged with the many award ceremonies that precede the Oscars: the Golden Globes, the New York Critics Association, its LA equivalent, followed by all the different guilds within the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, directors, writers, actors, and so on. Then the hacks weigh in to handicap the race, we get endless boring behind-the-ceremony features, and the usual nonsense about dresses, hairdos and what big rock Shazza's gonna wear. A long time ago Oscar night was a good excuse for an at-home knees-up, 20 drunks in a suburban living-room all screaming at the TV as Dances With Wolves beats GoodFellas for best picture. Not any more, though. I gave up on it after Forrest Gump cleaned up, at just about the time I lost interest in presidential politics. Actually, the politicians are suddenly managing to make things much more interesting in their race. I wouldn't dream of voting for a Goldwater Republican (or any other kind) like John McCain, but anyone who can make jokes about Alzheimer's disease (\"You can hide your own Easter eggs!\") and still expect an endorsement from Nancy Reagan, earns my admiration for sheer effrontery and a guffaw-prompting lack of tact.

      "bodyText": "Frank Dobson last night made his most determined attempt to throw off his image as the creature of the Labour machine in London's mayoral race, backtracking on his support for Tony Blair's plans for partial privatisation of the tube and declaring that the government would have a \"fight on their hands\" if it opposed him. Using the first public debate between the three main parties' mayoral candidates - organised by the Guardian - and facing Ken Livingstone, who was sitting 15 yards away in the audience, the former health secretary attacked the Labour leadership as \"prats\" and said the decision to use an electoral college to pick the party's candidate had been \"stupid\". Warning that he did \"not trust the officials at the department of transport to get these things right\", Mr Dobson - who earlier this week derided Mr Livingstone's public-sector bond alternative as \"pie in the sky\" - announced that he planned to appoint an independent panel to look at the financing of each scheme on its merits. His new line, revealed at the Guardian debate in Church House, Westminster, came only a day after Mr Livingstone said the mayoral election would become a \"referendum on London's right to govern itself\" unless Labour dropped its scheme to part-privatise the tube. But last night, the former Greater London council leader - who said he was at the meeting as part of his effort to \"listen to Londoners\" before making up his mind on his next move - appeared unimpressed by Mr Dobson's shift in his direction. \"The question is: will we have partial privatisation of the tube or not?\" Mr Livingstone's spokesman said after the meeting. \"A public-private partnership for the tube was overwhelmingly rejected by the party membership. Labour needs a candidate who has a clear policy on the tube. It's not going to be possible to get through the election without a policy.\" But the Brent East MP, who was given a standing ovation by a large part of the 500-strong audience as he arrived, came under attack from Susan Kramer, the Liberal Democrat mayoral candidate, for failing to vote against the government's plans for London Underground in parliament. Ms Kramer, who also backs a bond-financed modernisation public-sector scheme, taunted Mr Livingstone to declare his expected independent candidacy: \"I just wish anybody who wants to get into this race will get into it.\" The Tory candidate, Steve Norris, called Labour's selection an \"utterly shameful gerrymandered and corrupt process\". Meanwhile, trade union leaders last night issued a cautiously worded statement aimed at putting pressure on Mr Livingstone not to stand as an independent and calling for \"unity around the official Labour candidate\". After a meeting of the trade union Labour liaison committee, an umbrella group for Labour-affiliated unions, its chairman, Bill Morris, urged Mr Livingstone not to leave the party and to meet Labour's general secretary, Margaret McDonagh, and himself to discuss his concerns. The statement comes after a decision by the London regional council of the Rail Maritime and Transport union on Wednesday to call on Mr Livingstone to stand as an independent. Yesterday, the Communication Workers' Union executive voted down a motion pressing Mr Livingstone to accept the outcome of Labour's selection and back Mr Dobson. A Labour spokesman said Mr Morris's statement was \"potentially an important development\" in moves to end the stand-off between the party leadership and Mr Livingstone, who has also been approached directly by Ms McDonagh asking for a meeting. But the party's Millbank headquarters rejected any suggestion that Mr Dobson's change of tune on the underground represented a u-turn on policy or that the party leadership might be prepared to shift its own ground on the controversy. \"Basically, Frank can say what he likes about the tube modernisation,\" a senior spokesman said last night. \"But the policy is the policy and it doesn't matter whether it's Frank or Ken, that's the situation.

Every detail of the orchestral writing sparkles, every rhythm is irrepressible. The cast is led by Tito Gobbi, who encompasses every facet of Falstaff's larger-than-life personality, Rolando Panerai is an imposing Ford, and the merry wives themselves are led by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf's Alice. Wonderfully guided by Karajan, the performance becomes the glorious, life-affirming celebration it should be. </p> <p><strong> Key recording: Karajan (EMI 5 67162 2, two CDs)</strong></p>",

Disruption to routine and changes to where the baby sleeps could be partly to blame, it is thought. The study by the office for national statistics found that between 1993 and 1998, 1,431 babies died from sudden infant death syndrome during the week and 705 at the weekend or on a public holiday. Experts had assumed that there was an equal chance of death whatever the day, but found that 50 more babies than expected died on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. The trend was not seen in other deaths among infants aged between 28 days and one and there is uncertainty over why there was an increased risk of cot death on weekends. The report's author, Nirupa Dattani, said: \"It could be attributed to a number of factors, including changing parental routines, changes in the environment.\" Cot deaths fell by a third between 1993 and 1998, while the overall infant mortality rate decreased by a tenth. The reduction in cot deaths was mainly due to better guidance about how babies should sleep to avoid the risk of the syndrome. In 1998 there were 280 cot deaths in England and Wales, compared with 453 in 1993. The report found that low birth weight babies, twins and triplets, and children born outside marriage are at increased risk of cot death. More than 60% of cot deaths occurred in babies where the parents were not married, according to the ONS. There are also regional variations in the rate of cot deaths, the study revealed. The north west consistently had the highest rate while north Thames boasted the lowest. Cot death rates by region for 1998 were as follows (rate is deaths per 1,000 live births): North west: 0.55; Northern and Yorkshire: 0.51; Trent: 0.41; West Midlands: 0.35; Anglia and Oxford: 0.41; North Thames: 0.39; North Thames: 0.29; South and West: 0.65; Wales: 0.42.

Important details about their deaths are not being collected and analysed nationally, so vital information is being lost that could save lives.\"",

Health authority officials have decided that it would be \"inappropriate\" for relatives to have to use or even pass by the surgery in the centre of Hyde, Greater Manchester. Shipman operated a one-man practice from the surgery for six years during which he set out on a killing spree which led to him receiving 15 life sentences at Preston crown court last month. The decision to move to new premises was endorsed last night by the Tameside and Glossop community health council. \"We think it would be very unsettling for patients to be treated in premises where at least five women have died at the hands of their GP,\" said Pauline Davenport, chair of the council. \"We need to restore some of the trust in the patient-doctor relationship that has been eroded by recent events.

      "body": "<p>Anniversaries can exercise a lunar pull on events. That was the effect, last year, of Nato's 50th anniversary, the imminence of which hardened western policy toward Serbia and helped bring on the Kosovo war. This year the March anniversary of the beginning of that war has set off efforts by the Milosevic regime to undo what there is of a settlement in Kosovo, with dramatic results in Mitrovice. The shock of Mitrovice, where international troops face the hostility, and perhaps the bullets, of both sides, could be salutary. As we approach the date when Nato's bombing campaign began last year, it is urgent that there should be a review of the failures of western policy not only in Kosovo, but also in Bosnia and in the wider region.</p> <p>It is election year in America, and European states have their domestic preoccupations. But the temptation to let the Balkans slide ought to be resisted because of two important changes, one hopeful and one threatening. The first is the replacement of the Tudjman regime in Croatia last month by a genuinely democratic government, which does not want to continue running part of Bosnia as a covert dependency. This could mean a new start in Bosnia, the beginning of an end to \"soft partition\" between the three ethnic zones, and have wider beneficial effects. The second, threatening, development is that Slobodan Milosevic is going on the offensive, or preparing to do so, in northern Kosovo, Montenegro, and the Albanian populated parts of southern Serbia.</p> <p>The standard approach in both Bosnia and Kosovo has been to avoid trouble, especially trouble which might lead to military casualties.

      "bodyText": "Anniversaries can exercise a lunar pull on events. That was the effect, last year, of Nato's 50th anniversary, the imminence of which hardened western policy toward Serbia and helped bring on the Kosovo war. This year the March anniversary of the beginning of that war has set off efforts by the Milosevic regime to undo what there is of a settlement in Kosovo, with dramatic results in Mitrovice. The shock of Mitrovice, where international troops face the hostility, and perhaps the bullets, of both sides, could be salutary. As we approach the date when Nato's bombing campaign began last year, it is urgent that there should be a review of the failures of western policy not only in Kosovo, but also in Bosnia and in the wider region. It is election year in America, and European states have their domestic preoccupations. But the temptation to let the Balkans slide ought to be resisted because of two important changes, one hopeful and one threatening. The first is the replacement of the Tudjman regime in Croatia last month by a genuinely democratic government, which does not want to continue running part of Bosnia as a covert dependency. This could mean a new start in Bosnia, the beginning of an end to \"soft partition\" between the three ethnic zones, and have wider beneficial effects. The second, threatening, development is that Slobodan Milosevic is going on the offensive, or preparing to do so, in northern Kosovo, Montenegro, and the Albanian populated parts of southern Serbia. The standard approach in both Bosnia and Kosovo has been to avoid trouble, especially trouble which might lead to military casualties. The international authorities installed in both territories face entrenched ethnic attitudes, a one-party mentality in politics, distorted economic structures that reinforce patronage and communal separation, corruption and organised crime. But the \"internationals\", as they are called, have serious problems of cohesion, because so many organisations and nationalities are involved.

Making the claim that a national newspaper is in the secret grip of the IRA is a good enough wheeze. Mr Johnson's naivety on Ireland is a bonus for his columnist, Stephen Glover, a fanatical unionist. Mr Glover, who is the only son of the late character actor Brian, is regularly \"used\" by intelligence sources. In this role as an MI5/6 \"asset\", he is in a long line of obliging Spectator figures from Dominic Lawson to Alan Judd. Mr Johnson also enjoys the social cachet of dining with spooks.

      "bodyText": "The Spectator has announced that the Guardian's line on Northern Ireland is covertly dictated by a republican cell, which has cleverly infiltrated its staff, taking its editor on pub crawls of the Bogside, impregnating its deputy editor and luring its columnists to secret fishing trips in Co Donegal. It is a disturbing claim by the magazine, which has lurched uncertainly under the new editorship of Boris Johnson, a tousled-haired Old Salopian who once stood for a Scottish constituency in the hope of acquiring the gravitas which some feel he lacks as a journalist. Mr Johnson has little understanding of Northern Ireland, but appreciates that his career prospects depend on increasing circulation. Making the claim that a national newspaper is in the secret grip of the IRA is a good enough wheeze. Mr Johnson's naivety on Ireland is a bonus for his columnist, Stephen Glover, a fanatical unionist. Mr Glover, who is the only son of the late character actor Brian, is regularly \"used\" by intelligence sources. In this role as an MI5/6 \"asset\", he is in a long line of obliging Spectator figures from Dominic Lawson to Alan Judd. Mr Johnson also enjoys the social cachet of dining with spooks. He will never admit error. As he often tells his sister, Ulrika: \"If it's only half true it's only half wrong.\" Some Guardian readers may find some of the above hard to believe. They are right. Some of it is true, some is half-baked gossip and some is garbage. But the fun of Doughty Street journalism is working out which is which. You decide.",

      "body": "<p>Hillary Clinton has already been accused of running a Mickey Mouse campaign in her run for a New York senate seat this November - her latest blunder was to fail to leave a tip after eating in a restaurant - but further evidence emerged yesterday when it was revealed that her biggest cash backers were the employees of Walt Disney.</p> <p>Mrs Clinton raised at least $437,000 (\u00a3272,500) from the entertainment industry last year - $56,550 from Disneyland - second only to the number of contributions from those in the law field.</p> <p>Lawyers, a traditional Democrat constituency, gave $667,000. They have particular reason to be grateful to the Clintons, who have so far paid $5.9m in fees for their various legal battles and who still owe $4.3m.</p> <p>The first lady and her opponent, Rudolph Giuliani, the mayor of New York, aim to raise $25m each to finance their campaigns for the seat in the US senate, making it the most expensive electoral race of its kind.</p> <p>Mrs Clinton may have the big names, but Mr Giuliani has the big money. By the end of last year Mrs Clinton had raised $8.07m but her rival easily topped that with $11.78m. Both spent most of their money on mailshots asking for more cash.</p> <p>She says that he is taking money from extreme rightwingers around the country; he has not yet formally announced that he will run. Bruce Teitelbaum, Mr Giuliani's campaign spokesman, said: \"Hillary's Hollywood pals are paying big bucks to elect someone from Illinois and Arkansas to represent the people of New York. Maybe she should run in California.\"</p> <p>Howard Wolfson, spokesman for Mrs Clinton, said the volume of contributions from the entertainment industry came because she was \"a champion of the arts\". \"She's running against a guy who tried to shut down a museum,\" he added.</p> <p>This was a reference to Mr Giuliani's attempt to withdraw funds from the Brooklyn Museum of Art because it hosted the Sensation exhibition of works by young British artists. The mayor took particular exception to the work of Chris Ofili, the Turner Prize-winning artist whose painting the Holy Virgin Mary was created using elephant dung.</p> <p><b> Styron's choice</b><br></p> <p>Mrs Clinton's starrier list of contributors also included members of the literati, such as William Styron, author of Sophie's Choice, and his wife Rose who gave $3,000 between them. Jean Auel, who wrote Clan of the Cave Bear, gave $1,000 and even Gail Sheehy, whose biography of Mrs Clinton was none-too-friendly, came up with $500.</p> <p>Tina Brown, the British editor of Talk magazine, came through with $1,000 - a month after publishing the interview with Mrs Clinton that helped to generate a buzz for the first issue.</p> <p>Not all the offerings were so unequivocally fragrant: Sean \"Puffy\" Combs - also known as Puff Daddy - the rap music entrepreneur who gave $1,000, has just been charged with bribery. He already faces firearms charges.</p> <p>Mr Wolfson said that the Clinton camp had no intention of returning Puffy's money. \"We believe in the presumption of innocence,\" he said.</p> <p>But Mr Giuliani's roll-call of the Republican establishment also accommodates supporters in keeping with his combative personality. Among them are Mike Ditka, one of the most widely disliked coaches in professional football, and Charlton Heston who, in addition to his responsibilities to the cinema audience, is president of the National Rifles Association. Paradoxically, the caustic Mr Giuliani is in favour of tighter gun control.</p> <p>Like Mrs Clinton, Mr Giuliani has supporters in the gay community: she has Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Fund ($2,000) and Virginia Apuzzo of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force ($1,000); he has members of the Log Cabin Republicans ($3,000).</p> <p>The mayor has also received money from prominent restaurateurs in New York City, including Warner LeRoy who reopened the Russian Tea Room recently, and Sottha Khunn, the chef at Le Cirque 2000.</p> <p>Each candidate has designer supporters but other kings and queens of the catwalk hedged their bets. Oscar de la Renta, for instance, gave $1,000 to the mayor and to Mrs Clinton.

      "bodyText": "Hillary Clinton has already been accused of running a Mickey Mouse campaign in her run for a New York senate seat this November - her latest blunder was to fail to leave a tip after eating in a restaurant - but further evidence emerged yesterday when it was revealed that her biggest cash backers were the employees of Walt Disney. Mrs Clinton raised at least $437,000 (\u00a3272,500) from the entertainment industry last year - $56,550 from Disneyland - second only to the number of contributions from those in the law field. Lawyers, a traditional Democrat constituency, gave $667,000. They have particular reason to be grateful to the Clintons, who have so far paid $5.9m in fees for their various legal battles and who still owe $4.3m. The first lady and her opponent, Rudolph Giuliani, the mayor of New York, aim to raise $25m each to finance their campaigns for the seat in the US senate, making it the most expensive electoral race of its kind. Mrs Clinton may have the big names, but Mr Giuliani has the big money. By the end of last year Mrs Clinton had raised $8.07m but her rival easily topped that with $11.78m. Both spent most of their money on mailshots asking for more cash. She says that he is taking money from extreme rightwingers around the country; he has not yet formally announced that he will run. Bruce Teitelbaum, Mr Giuliani's campaign spokesman, said: \"Hillary's Hollywood pals are paying big bucks to elect someone from Illinois and Arkansas to represent the people of New York. Maybe she should run in California.\" Howard Wolfson, spokesman for Mrs Clinton, said the volume of contributions from the entertainment industry came because she was \"a champion of the arts\". \"She's running against a guy who tried to shut down a museum,\" he added. This was a reference to Mr Giuliani's attempt to withdraw funds from the Brooklyn Museum of Art because it hosted the Sensation exhibition of works by young British artists. The mayor took particular exception to the work of Chris Ofili, the Turner Prize-winning artist whose painting the Holy Virgin Mary was created using elephant dung. Styron's choice Mrs Clinton's starrier list of contributors also included members of the literati, such as William Styron, author of Sophie's Choice, and his wife Rose who gave $3,000 between them. Jean Auel, who wrote Clan of the Cave Bear, gave $1,000 and even Gail Sheehy, whose biography of Mrs Clinton was none-too-friendly, came up with $500. Tina Brown, the British editor of Talk magazine, came through with $1,000 - a month after publishing the interview with Mrs Clinton that helped to generate a buzz for the first issue. Not all the offerings were so unequivocally fragrant: Sean \"Puffy\" Combs - also known as Puff Daddy - the rap music entrepreneur who gave $1,000, has just been charged with bribery. He already faces firearms charges. Mr Wolfson said that the Clinton camp had no intention of returning Puffy's money. \"We believe in the presumption of innocence,\" he said. But Mr Giuliani's roll-call of the Republican establishment also accommodates supporters in keeping with his combative personality. Among them are Mike Ditka, one of the most widely disliked coaches in professional football, and Charlton Heston who, in addition to his responsibilities to the cinema audience, is president of the National Rifles Association. Paradoxically, the caustic Mr Giuliani is in favour of tighter gun control. Like Mrs Clinton, Mr Giuliani has supporters in the gay community: she has Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights Fund ($2,000) and Virginia Apuzzo of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force ($1,000); he has members of the Log Cabin Republicans ($3,000). The mayor has also received money from prominent restaurateurs in New York City, including Warner LeRoy who reopened the Russian Tea Room recently, and Sottha Khunn, the chef at Le Cirque 2000. Each candidate has designer supporters but other kings and queens of the catwalk hedged their bets. Oscar de la Renta, for instance, gave $1,000 to the mayor and to Mrs Clinton. Nicole Miller found $2,000 for him and $1,000 for her. However the contest is not being fought exclusively at the level of who can attract the most famous followers. Mrs Clinton's camp has accused Mr Giuliani of allying with the extreme right because his fund-raising letters were written with the assistance of Richard Viguerie, whose record includes helping Jerry Falwell to set up the rightwing group Moral Majority 21 years ago. \"If these are Rudy Giuliani's allies, what kind of senator would he be?\" Mr Wolfson asked.

The group had initially sued for \u00a3218,000 in unpaid royalties from the Italian firm, sponsors of their world tour in 1998, but Mrs Justice Arden dismissed that action and found in favour of a counter-claim by the company. Aprilia claimed \u00a3434,000 for misrepresentation following Geri Halliwell's departure from the group shortly after they had signed a \u00a3500,000 sponsorship agreement. A further claim of \u00a31.6m for breach of contract was dismissed. Mrs Justice Arden upheld Aprilia's argument that the group had known Ms Halliwell was leaving the Spice Girls when they signed the sponsorship agreement in May, 1998. Her departure undermined Aprilia's marketing campaign and promotional material, which had featured all five group members, the judge ruled. Damages, costs and interest owed will be set at a future hearing, but yesterday it emerged that the group had rejected an offer to pay Aprilia a smaller sum in damages. The total cost is expected to reach seven-figures. Mrs Justice Arden accepted the band had entered into the agreement in good faith. \"There is no suggestion whatever that the misrepresentation was intentional.\" A spokesman for Aprilia said that before receiving a writ they had been willing to write off their losses, and been \"astonished\" when the group sued in October, 1998. \"Aprilia would not have sued if the Spice Girls had not brought their claim, and were deeply disappointed when they did.\" When the Spice Girls began negotiations with Aprilia in the early part of 1998 the group consisted of Ms Halliwell, Victoria Adams, Emma Bunting, Melanie Brown and Melanie Chisolm. But at a meeting backstage at Wembley arena on April 25, 1998, Ms Halliwell told the other group members she would be leaving at the end of the world tour the following September. Just 10 days later they signed a one-year sponsorship agreement with Aprilia. The agreement covered participating in commercials, photo shoots and providing a logo featuring all five band members for a special edition scooter, the Spice Sonic. Roberto Brovazzo, head of Aprilia's marketing department, said that the group was \"symbolic of the fashionable, fresh and a bit cheeky image that Aprilia wanted to convey for the Sonic scooter which it had recently launched\".

      "bodyText": "The government's hopes of selling part of British Nuclear Fuels took a fresh battering yesterday when a German reactor to which the firm sold fuel with falsified documents suspended operations and asked for compensation. The decision threatened the future of BNFL's contracts for the sale of reprocessed fuel to German power stations. The company has already lost its only firm order from Japan because of a continuing row over its falsification of quality control guarantees. PreussenElektra, the utility which runs the Unterweser reactor near the Dutch border, said the shutdown was ordered so that it could replace fuel elements delivered with falsified papers four years ago. The German firm said it was satisfied that the fuel rods had not compromised safety at the plant. \"Nevertheless, the fact that documents had been falsified by a supplier is, in the opinion of PreussenElektra, so serious that the firm opted for the replacement of the relevant fuel elements.\" The suspension represented a victory for political consid erations over technical advice. PreussenElektra officials had previously made it clear that they did not consider it necessary to suspend operations on safety grounds . This is bad news for BNFL. Germany's Green environment minister, J\u00fcrgen Trittin, is a determined opponent of nuclear reprocessing. The move will strengthen his drive to persuade the utilities to break off dealings with BNFL. The Unterweser plant, a boiling water reactor with a capacity similar to that of the Sizewell B plant, has been in operation since 1979.",

      "bodyText": "Motorists who break speed limits will face toughened penalties, including more penalty points and earlier disqualification, under a new offence of excessive speeding to be unveiled by minsters next week. Measures stemming from the long-awaited road safety review, to be unveiled next Wednesday, will target unsafe and careless drivers as part of government efforts to make speeding as socially unacceptable as drink driving. However, though the high penalties for those who break limits by a wide margin will please safety campaigners, there will be disappointment if speed limits are left at current levels, as expected. Despite receiving advice, according to a BBC Panorama programme, that 2,500 children a year could be saved from serious injury if a nationwide 20mph speed limit were introduced on all roads frequented by children, the review will leave the decision about whether to cut speed limits in built-up areas to local authorities, possibly with an extended remit to introduce low-speed zones. Ministers are also understood to have shied away from imposing a national speed limit of 50mph on rural roads - down from 60mph. Maintaining current speed limits will leave the government open to accusations that a fear of angering motorists, particularly in rural areas, has overtaken safety concerns. The review, announced in a white paper in 1998, is expected to include measures to clamp down on drink drivers, including tougher punishments and steeper fines. Strict new US-style retraining schemes for offenders, including those guilty of violence, are expected to form part of the package. So are proposals for fast new digital breathalysers. The government decided not to cut the drink-drive limit from 80mg to 50mg of alcohol per 100mls of blood. This is despite the fact that its own consultation paper suggested that a cut to 50mg would save 50 lives and nearly 1,500 serious injuries a year. John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, originally spoke out strongly in favour. But the concerns of Downing Street advisers that such a measure would damage country pubs and be widely resented have won out. As well as looking at tougher penalties, in conjunction with the home office, the review will cover all aspects of road safety, including the training of drivers and vehicle standards. Consultation is expected on a mandatory six-month L-plate period for all learner drivers, together with a proposal that drivers should be required to carry special continental-style provisional plates for the first year after they qualify. Fixed penalty fines for traffic offences - such as jumping a red light - are also expected to rise from the current \u00a340. The speed limits issue has proved the trickiest element of the review for the government. Last autumn, there were reports that Downing Street had intervened to veto plans to cut speed limits on single-carriageway rural roads. The environment minister, Lord Whitty, announced new legislation last summer allowing local authorities to create reduced speed zones in residential areas without prior government approval. More than 600 20mph schemes have been introduced and have proved successful, reducing overall pedestrian casualties by 60% and child pedestrian and child cyclist casualties by 67%. However, local authorities are concerned that imposing new local speed limits without adequate enforcement powers will merely anger motorists and traders to no useful effect.",

The days of carrying around heavy batteries for laptop computers and mobile phones will be numbered.\"</p> <p>Other labs around the world, looking ahead to the day about a 10 years away when it will be impossible to crowd more transistors onto silicon chips, have tried to fashion magnetic ones. But they have only been able to make them work at a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.</p> <p>Shirt pocket computers and mobiles small enough to fit into the palm of the hand are already commonplace, but their processing power and battery life is limited.</p> <p>\"Mobile phones will soon need to have a lot more computing power on board,\" said Dr Cowburn.</p> <p>\"It's a question of packing more computer power into the same space so you can use the internet.\"</p> <p>What the Cambridge team has done is to create a magnetic transistor one ten millionth of a metre across, consisting of a nickel-iron dot.</p> <p>This basic building block of the new chip could one day be 40,000 times smaller than its silicon equivalent, making it possible to squeeze 250 bn transistors into a square centimetre.</p> <p>Fizzing with electricity, silicon chips gobble up power and generate heat. They use millions of voltage fluctations to \"think\". In the new chip, millions of sub-microscopic magnets \"think\" by continually switching polarity, requiring only a little battery power to feed in data and extract the results.</p> <p>The Cambridge team, whose research is published in the latest edition of the journal Science, has patented its discovery, but commercial exploitation is about 10 years away. It took Cowburn and Welland three years to develop their minute magnetic dots and the means to control them. The magnetic chip relies on the peculiarities of quantum physics - the weird physical behaviour of matter and energy at the atomic level. It would not work if it were any bigger.</p> <p>The magnetic chip is the most advanced of a range of exotic technologies looking to make ever tinier, ever more powerful computers once silicon has reached its limits. Other scientists are working towards light-based computers, quantum computers built from individual atoms, and biological computers.</p> <p>Dr Cowburn said the brains of future computers could be hybrid chips - part magnetic, part biological and part light-based.</p>",

In a breakthrough which could give ultra-light mobiles computing power far in excess of today's most souped-up desktop PC, British scientists have made a chip which uses magnetism instead of electricity to process data. As well as packing a greater data processing punch, magnetic chips require a fraction of the power used by silicon chips. The bulky batteries used by today's laptop computers could be replaced by watch batteries. \"It's a completely new type of microchip,\" said Russsell Cowburn, who developed the technology with Mark Welland at Cambridge university. \"We're the first to demonstrate anything like this working at room temperature. \"Computers developed using magnetic microchips will need much less power to work. The days of carrying around heavy batteries for laptop computers and mobile phones will be numbered.\" Other labs around the world, looking ahead to the day about a 10 years away when it will be impossible to crowd more transistors onto silicon chips, have tried to fashion magnetic ones. But they have only been able to make them work at a fraction of a degree above absolute zero. Shirt pocket computers and mobiles small enough to fit into the palm of the hand are already commonplace, but their processing power and battery life is limited. \"Mobile phones will soon need to have a lot more computing power on board,\" said Dr Cowburn. \"It's a question of packing more computer power into the same space so you can use the internet.\" What the Cambridge team has done is to create a magnetic transistor one ten millionth of a metre across, consisting of a nickel-iron dot. This basic building block of the new chip could one day be 40,000 times smaller than its silicon equivalent, making it possible to squeeze 250 bn transistors into a square centimetre. Fizzing with electricity, silicon chips gobble up power and generate heat. They use millions of voltage fluctations to \"think\". In the new chip, millions of sub-microscopic magnets \"think\" by continually switching polarity, requiring only a little battery power to feed in data and extract the results. The Cambridge team, whose research is published in the latest edition of the journal Science, has patented its discovery, but commercial exploitation is about 10 years away. It took Cowburn and Welland three years to develop their minute magnetic dots and the means to control them. The magnetic chip relies on the peculiarities of quantum physics - the weird physical behaviour of matter and energy at the atomic level. It would not work if it were any bigger. The magnetic chip is the most advanced of a range of exotic technologies looking to make ever tinier, ever more powerful computers once silicon has reached its limits. Other scientists are working towards light-based computers, quantum computers built from individual atoms, and biological computers. Dr Cowburn said the brains of future computers could be hybrid chips - part magnetic, part biological and part light-based.",

During the 1980s he was a regular traveller to apartheid South Africa. Some of his rhetoric came back to haunt Mr Colvin when Nelson Mandela was swept to power on a wave of worldwide popularity. In 1990 Mr Colvin deplored \"the continued condemnation of South Africa on the basis of largely obsolete disinformation sedulously propagated by the anti-apartheid movement\". Mr Colvin's interest in South Africa landed him in difficulty with Commons authorities when, along with the disgraced former MP Neil Hamilton, he failed to declare an interest with a lobbying firm linked to the apartheid regime. Mr Colvin said in 1994 that he was guilty of no more than an \"oversight\" when he failed to register a paid consultancy with Strategy Network International, which lobbied against the imposition of economic sanctions on apartheid South Africa. Mr Temple-Morris, who never shared his friend's views on South Africa, believes that Mr Colvin's stance before the fall of apartheid should not detract from his record as an MP. \"Michael had a Conservative colonial attitude which was not in the same league as some rightwing Tories. \"He believed in gentle change and would not have believed in agitating against the regime.\" As a wealty landowner - he farmed 855 acres in Hampshire - and a passionate defender of country sports, Mr Colvin was one of a handful of Tory MPs who became close to the Prince of Wales. His admiration for the prince prompted him to speak in 1992 of his \"profound disquiet at the thought that the Princess of Wales might one day become Queen\". Despite his wealth, Mr Colvin complained earlier this week that he too was suffering in the present farming crisis.

Clement Attlee, whose post-war premiership saw the creation of the national health service and the modern welfare state, was selected as Labour's greatest leader. Also finishing higher than the prime minister in the poll, carried out by the New Statesman magazine, were Harold Wilson - who won four elections for Labour in the 1960s and 70s - and John Smith, who died in 1994 after just two years as leader. Not all votes cast for Mr Blair by 80 of Labour's 418 MPs who responded were favourable, with one naming him as the party's worst leader. However, that dubious honour went to Ramsay MacDonald, Labour's first prime minister, who was expelled from the party for his \"betrayal\" of 1931 when he formed a national coalition government with Liberals and Conservatives. When the government split and fell over financial problems caused by high unemployment, MacDonald did not tender his resignation to the king, but instead offered to form a national government, turning his back on the party he helped create. Mr Brown won the \"best leader who never was\" vote by a whisker from Denis Healey, followed by Aneurin Bevan, Ernest Bevin, Tony Benn and Robin Cook. The creation of the NHS was selected as the party's proudest achievement by 63 of the participants, with mentions also for the minimum wage, the welfare state and the abolition of the death penalty.

      "body": "<p>Extolling the virtues of management consultants is not an activity to be indulged in lightly. But watching the first episode of <strong> Great Military Blunders</strong> (C4) left one with the impression that nothing would have helped save the British and US armies from their greatest battlefield balls-ups so much as a few months of the McKinsey treatment. It was the programme's intent to demonstrate that these tragic disasters all stemmed from the destructive vanity of impossibly ignorant military leaders - but what was even more glaringly obvious was how the army hierarchies simply weren't designed to allow for the existence of anyone to question them. </p> <p>\"We lost about 200 men before the fighting started. And that was when we realised things were starting to go wrong\", one former soldier noted with comical understatement of Operation Market Garden, the doomed attack at Arnhem in 1944 that sacrificed numerous British lives to Montgomery's towering arrogance. Meanwhile, General MacArthur's terrifying nuclear brinkmanship with Mao (as we learned by means of the kind of hurried juxtapositions that pass for psychoanalysis when you've only got 15 minutes per war leader) was all down to his mother, who hired a hotel room overlooking her son's room at the West Point military academy for four years, to check that the future atom bomb enthusiast was doing his homework properly. </p> <p>But the film did find time for some less well-thumbed pages of military history. Charles Townshend's doomed quest to conquer Baghdad, culminating in the humiliating siege of Kut, was revealed, true to the pro gramme's somewhat monomaniacal argument, to be nothing more than an attempt to kick-start a stagnating career. His strategy failed, but the Turks gave Townshend a first-class ticket to Constantinople, luxury accommodation and a free yacht, while tens of thousands of his men were killed or languished in prison. He never asked after them. </p> <p>It's tempting to draw parallels between such mindless self-certainty and the similarly destructive arrogance on display in <strong> Dispatches: Tax Wars</strong> (C4), which took a trawl through some of the more incomprehensible and infuriating VAT decisions of HM Customs and Excise, who are prone to slap ruinous tax liabilities on formerly zero-rated businesses for no discernible reason. The same cavalier disregard for the possibility of alternative viewpoints was certainly on display at one biscuit factory, forced to spend thousands in legal bills defending the notion that marshmallows in wafer cones are biscuits not cakes - before Customs grudgingly admitted that it had probably misread its own rulebook. But the truly interesting revelation of this otherwise unremarkable documentary was that the motive isn't arrogance at all, but a craven fear of internally imposed revenue targets - where failure can mean a reduced pay packet or even disciplinary proceedings. </p> <p>There's absolutely no reason why <strong> Fred Dibnah's Magnificent Monuments</strong> (BBC2, 8pm) should work. It's hard to imagine a metropolitan BBC commissioning editor responding positively to the idea of sending any other bumbling gent in a flat cap and collarless shirt with a heavy Lancastrian accent motoring around Britain to poke around old buildings aimlessly, regularly emitting a gurgling chuckle that would sound frankly lecherous if its objects weren't wattle and daub and well crafted roof tiles. But there has been no real explanation for Dib nah ever since his early work as a pioneer of televised steeplejacking, and nobody seems to mind. The series has the feel of having slipped, fully formed, through a gap in time from an era when pointing a camera at something interesting - the intricate oak panelling of Hampton Court Palace, in this case, and the windows of Lacock Abbey in Wiltshire, where Fox Talbot invented photography - counted as good television. Oddly, it still does. </p> <p>There's evidence, too, that Dibnah's is not a persona honed for the small screen: he seems to have been like this as a teenager, as he revealed in last night's episode. Eschewing conventional adolescent pursuits, he built a spindly replacement chimney on his parents' house. He didn't design it first. \"I just kept altering it in shape and size as it went up... The new owners want to dismantle it, but the council's put a preservation order on it\", said Dibnah. And chuckled.</p>",

And that was when we realised things were starting to go wrong\", one former soldier noted with comical understatement of Operation Market Garden, the doomed attack at Arnhem in 1944 that sacrificed numerous British lives to Montgomery's towering arrogance. Meanwhile, General MacArthur's terrifying nuclear brinkmanship with Mao (as we learned by means of the kind of hurried juxtapositions that pass for psychoanalysis when you've only got 15 minutes per war leader) was all down to his mother, who hired a hotel room overlooking her son's room at the West Point military academy for four years, to check that the future atom bomb enthusiast was doing his homework properly. But the film did find time for some less well-thumbed pages of military history. Charles Townshend's doomed quest to conquer Baghdad, culminating in the humiliating siege of Kut, was revealed, true to the pro gramme's somewhat monomaniacal argument, to be nothing more than an attempt to kick-start a stagnating career. His strategy failed, but the Turks gave Townshend a first-class ticket to Constantinople, luxury accommodation and a free yacht, while tens of thousands of his men were killed or languished in prison. He never asked after them. It's tempting to draw parallels between such mindless self-certainty and the similarly destructive arrogance on display in Dispatches: Tax Wars (C4), which took a trawl through some of the more incomprehensible and infuriating VAT decisions of HM Customs and Excise, who are prone to slap ruinous tax liabilities on formerly zero-rated businesses for no discernible reason. The same cavalier disregard for the possibility of alternative viewpoints was certainly on display at one biscuit factory, forced to spend thousands in legal bills defending the notion that marshmallows in wafer cones are biscuits not cakes - before Customs grudgingly admitted that it had probably misread its own rulebook. But the truly interesting revelation of this otherwise unremarkable documentary was that the motive isn't arrogance at all, but a craven fear of internally imposed revenue targets - where failure can mean a reduced pay packet or even disciplinary proceedings. There's absolutely no reason why Fred Dibnah's Magnificent Monuments (BBC2, 8pm) should work. It's hard to imagine a metropolitan BBC commissioning editor responding positively to the idea of sending any other bumbling gent in a flat cap and collarless shirt with a heavy Lancastrian accent motoring around Britain to poke around old buildings aimlessly, regularly emitting a gurgling chuckle that would sound frankly lecherous if its objects weren't wattle and daub and well crafted roof tiles. But there has been no real explanation for Dib nah ever since his early work as a pioneer of televised steeplejacking, and nobody seems to mind. The series has the feel of having slipped, fully formed, through a gap in time from an era when pointing a camera at something interesting - the intricate oak panelling of Hampton Court Palace, in this case, and the windows of Lacock Abbey in Wiltshire, where Fox Talbot invented photography - counted as good television. Oddly, it still does. There's evidence, too, that Dibnah's is not a persona honed for the small screen: he seems to have been like this as a teenager, as he revealed in last night's episode. Eschewing conventional adolescent pursuits, he built a spindly replacement chimney on his parents' house. He didn't design it first. \"I just kept altering it in shape and size as it went up... The new owners want to dismantle it, but the council's put a preservation order on it\", said Dibnah. And chuckled.",

Bannister is now chief executive of BBC Production - the in-house BBC department which makes Blood On The Carpet along with a number of Thirkell specials such as Trouble and The Big Top.

But to the waiting crowd at last night's Guardian London mayoral debate, he was the king in waiting. The debate, in Westminster's Church House, had been billed as the first chance to see the three main party's official candidates put their policies to Londoners. Mr Livingstone, who is enjoying a self-imposed week-long purdah while he waits for Mr Dobson's \"honourable resignation\", was not among the panel. The arrival of the Brent East MP was greeted like the return of the prodigal son by the 500-strong audience, who applauded, cheered and whistled as he made his way down the long narrow aisle to his seat, not on the podium alongside Labour's Frank Dobson, the Tories' Steven Norris and Liberal Democrat Susan Kramer, but four rows back, alongside the voters of London. The standing ovation from many in the audience, if embarrassing for the Brent East MP, delighted his entourage of supporters, one of whom remarked: \"That's the middle class people with nothing to do on a wet Thursday night vote sewn up.\" Unfortunately for Tony Blair and the apparatchiks at Millbank, the applause for the three official candidates was lukewarm in contrast. Mr Dobson and Mr Norris - both dressed in the obligatory uniform of sober politicians - dark suit, white shirt and burgundy tie - joined Ms Kramer and Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland on the podium, while Mr Livingstone smiled and blushed his way through the debate. After a show of hands revealed that the support among the audience was in favour of Mr Livingtone standing as either the official Labour or an independent candidate for the May 4 elections, it was time to get down to business. Mr Dobson said: \"I'm sick of what's wrong with London. There's a job to be done and I believe I can get that job done.\" He promised to tackle the problems on the tube, crime levels, lack of jobs and racism. Mr Dobson offered an olive brach to Mr Livingstone's supporters opposed to his policy of partial privatisation of the tube. He promised to set up an independent panel to review the best financing option for the tube and vowed to publish their findings. In a small climb-down from his previously stated policy, he said: \"Some people are dogmatically in favour of bonds and against PPP [public private partnership].

      "bodyText": "Michael Colvin, the 67-year-old Conservative MP who has died with his heiress wife in a fire at his Tangley House mansion, near Andover, would have made a presentable US-type presidential candidate. With handsome aquiline features and wavy white hair, the son of a naval captain who married into the Cayzer shipping fortune had the background to pursue his political ambitions. And the cushion of a 1,000-acre farming estate to fall back on. He was a friend of the Prince of Wales, but a sharp critic of Princess Diana. He was a leader of the post-Hungerford and post-Dunblane \"gun lobby\" and a supporter of field sports. He was also a somewhat secretive former propagandist for apartheid South Africa and a friend of other lobbyists such as Ian Greer, Neil Hamilton and Derek Laud. But he was not monochromatic. He was liberal on abortion, favoured free eye and dental treatment, and would have preferred the whites he backed in southern Africa to be more reformist Above all, he was a defence and aviation specialist, serving actively until last month on the defence select committee, which he chaired from 1995 to 1997. On Tuesday, two days before he died, he made a 25-minute speech, the longest in the Commons defence debate. His swansong deplored the forces' manpower shortage, which he attributed to the ministry of defence losing battles with the treasury. Colvin came by such interests naturally. He was born the son of Captain Ivan Beale Colvin RN and Joy Arbuthnot. His family had a political background: a great-great uncle had successfully introduced a bill to ban bear-baiting.

      "body": "<p>The deaths of more than 300 people this week in religious violence prompted by plans for the introduction of Islamic sharia law in the northern Nigerian state of Kaduna has brought fresh warnings that Africa's most populous country is fracturing.</p> <p>Nigeria's principal Islamic leader, the Sultan of Sokoto, warned that the bloody clashes between Muslim and Christian elements in the city of Kaduna posed a \"dangerous and very serious threat to the peace and unity of this great nation\".</p> <p>In a televised address to the nation, President Olusegun Obasanjo said that ethnic and religious violence - which has claimed more than 1,000 lives since democracy was restored in May - threatens Nigeria's revival after years of military rule which plundered the nation's wealth.</p> <p>\"To be engaged in activities that so unsettle public peace is not only criminal but highly unpatriotic, particularly now that the international community is beginning to regain its confidence in our nation,\" he said.</p> <p>But General Obasanjo's critics, who include some of the parliamentary leaders of his own People's Democratic party, say he is also to blame for the crisis. They accuse him of running an \"imperial presidency\", and say he remains aloof from ethnic and religious tensions while concentrating on solving Nigeria's enormous economic problems and staving off the threat of another army coup.</p> <p>In particular, they say his failure to take a stand on critical issues such as the introduction of sharia in some Muslim-dominated states has exacerbated the crisis by giving the impression that the government is uninterested in the concerns of ordinary people.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the national assembly called on President Obasanjo to make a \"categorical statement\" on the adoption of Islamic laws which, among other things, segregates the sexes in transport and schooling.</p> <p>Many Nigerians fear that if the violence intensifies, or if the country seems to be breaking up, there are military men waiting for an excuse to seize power.</p> <p>In an interview before the latest bloodshed, President Obasanjo acknowledged that ethnic and religious tensions were increasing, but insisted they would die down as the government turned the economy around: \"A lot of this violence happens because when you push people to that crescendo over an issue you have trouble pulling them back. But what leads to division and conflict is inequality. We have to tackle that first,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We have stabilised the currency. We have raised foreign exchange reserves. Inflation has gone from 14% to 8%. We know there is a lot of poverty. There are problems with education and water supply. But things are moving.\"</p> <p>Even Gen Obasanjo's critics acknowledge that in the past nine months he has achieved some notable successes. He took advantage of the near total disgrace of the army, and his own position as a former general and military ruler, to dismiss almost an entire layer of corrupt senior officers with barely a murmur of protest.</p> <p>Gen Obasanjo's anti-corruption programme has also been praised for sending the right message, even if it has a long way to go before significantly curbing graft. But the president is virtually at war with parliament, which has passed just one bill in nine months, and accuses its members of wanting to be bribed to do their work, particularly after they were granted huge \"furniture allowances\".</p> <p>\"The national assembly has a problem,\" the president said. \"The average age of the members is probably 29 or 30.

      "bodyText": "The deaths of more than 300 people this week in religious violence prompted by plans for the introduction of Islamic sharia law in the northern Nigerian state of Kaduna has brought fresh warnings that Africa's most populous country is fracturing. Nigeria's principal Islamic leader, the Sultan of Sokoto, warned that the bloody clashes between Muslim and Christian elements in the city of Kaduna posed a \"dangerous and very serious threat to the peace and unity of this great nation\". In a televised address to the nation, President Olusegun Obasanjo said that ethnic and religious violence - which has claimed more than 1,000 lives since democracy was restored in May - threatens Nigeria's revival after years of military rule which plundered the nation's wealth. \"To be engaged in activities that so unsettle public peace is not only criminal but highly unpatriotic, particularly now that the international community is beginning to regain its confidence in our nation,\" he said. But General Obasanjo's critics, who include some of the parliamentary leaders of his own People's Democratic party, say he is also to blame for the crisis. They accuse him of running an \"imperial presidency\", and say he remains aloof from ethnic and religious tensions while concentrating on solving Nigeria's enormous economic problems and staving off the threat of another army coup. In particular, they say his failure to take a stand on critical issues such as the introduction of sharia in some Muslim-dominated states has exacerbated the crisis by giving the impression that the government is uninterested in the concerns of ordinary people. On Wednesday, the national assembly called on President Obasanjo to make a \"categorical statement\" on the adoption of Islamic laws which, among other things, segregates the sexes in transport and schooling. Many Nigerians fear that if the violence intensifies, or if the country seems to be breaking up, there are military men waiting for an excuse to seize power. In an interview before the latest bloodshed, President Obasanjo acknowledged that ethnic and religious tensions were increasing, but insisted they would die down as the government turned the economy around: \"A lot of this violence happens because when you push people to that crescendo over an issue you have trouble pulling them back. But what leads to division and conflict is inequality. We have to tackle that first,\" he said. \"We have stabilised the currency. We have raised foreign exchange reserves. Inflation has gone from 14% to 8%. We know there is a lot of poverty. There are problems with education and water supply. But things are moving.\" Even Gen Obasanjo's critics acknowledge that in the past nine months he has achieved some notable successes. He took advantage of the near total disgrace of the army, and his own position as a former general and military ruler, to dismiss almost an entire layer of corrupt senior officers with barely a murmur of protest. Gen Obasanjo's anti-corruption programme has also been praised for sending the right message, even if it has a long way to go before significantly curbing graft. But the president is virtually at war with parliament, which has passed just one bill in nine months, and accuses its members of wanting to be bribed to do their work, particularly after they were granted huge \"furniture allowances\". \"The national assembly has a problem,\" the president said. \"The average age of the members is probably 29 or 30. They have power without knowl edge or experience, which is dangerous. They seem to get carried away by emotion or personal interest.\" The president's advisers say he is so sick of the national assembly that he will use his powers to bypass it if it fails to cooperate. Some parliamentarians, who say he has already carried out his threat, have threatened to impeach him for allegedly \"riding roughshod\" over every other arm of government and the courts after his administration ignored an order to release from prison a former senior army officer arrested for corruption. There is also considerable bitterness among representatives from the Niger Delta over the heavy-handed use of the army to deal with unrest in the oil-rich region, particularly in the village of Odi where soldiers massacred several hundred people and destroyed every house in November. Gen Obasanjo denies that he is out of touch: \"All the things I have done for the last eight months have been nothing but populist. The returning of looted goods, the ending of the queues at petrol stations, the going into human rights issues of the past are all popular.\" \"Democracy is a means to an end not an end in itself. If I go to my village and say, I will bring you democracy, they will say I am mad. But if I say I will bring you piped water and tarred roads because of democracy they will want to hear about it. That is what the people want and that is what I am doing.\"",

      "bodyText": "Japan's beleaguered nuclear industry suffered a new blow yesterday when a fire broke out at one of the country's power plants. Although no radiation was leaked, it is the latest of many accidents in recent years that has undermined public confidence in atomic energy, which Japan relies on for more than a third of its electricity. The fire broke out at the Onagawara nuclear power plant in Miyagi prefecture, about 200 miles north-east of Tokyo. Employees called the fire department after noticing smoke curling up from the power supply room, which is located below the control centre of the number-one reactor. According to the operator, Tohoku Electric Power, the fire burnt itself out before firemen arrived - half an hour after the accident was reported. The company said there were no injuries and no release of radiation because the 524-megawatt reactor had been shut down since last month for regular maintenance. Questions are likely to be raised, however, about the cause of the fire and the slow response of the emergency services. The accident comes five months after Japan's worst nuclear disaster, the uncontrolled chain reaction at a uranium-processing facility in Tokaimura, which killed one worker and exposed more than 400 people to radiation. A string of fires and leaks has exposed the industry's lax safety standards and crisis management. In 1997, an explosion at a reprocessing plant in Tokaimura exposed 37 workers to low-level radiation. Two years earlier, radioactive sodium had been released from the Monju fast-breeder reactor. In these and other cases, plant officials were criticised for slow responses that appeared to focus more on covering-up mishaps than dealing with them. In December, the government enacted new laws to tighten supervision of nuclear plants and speed up the process for dealing with accidents.

      "bodyText": "Turkey's judiciary launched a fresh offensive against Kurdish political activism yesterday, sending 18 people to prison for supporting the rebel Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), and charging three prominent Kurdish mayors with similar offences. The leader of Turkey's main pro-Kurdish party, Ahmet Turan Demir, and his predecessor, Murat Bozlak, were among the group of Kurds who received sentences of at least three years each. They were found guilty of organising demonstrations and hunger strikes early last year in support of the imprisoned Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. Their party, the People's Democracy party (Hadep), was already facing a legal challenge that could close it down. The new campaign against Hadep has dashed hopes that the Turkish establishment may relax restrictions on peaceful forms of Kurdish politics following the capture and sentencing of Ocalan. European institutions have been quick to express concern about the detention of the three Kurdish mayors from the towns of Siirt, Bingol and Diyarbakir, who were also members of Hadep. Under emergency regulations, they were detained at the weekend and questioned for four days without legal representation before being formally arrested yesterday. Diplomats in Ankara were particularly concerned about the way in which the three men were detained; the mayor of Diyarbakir, Feridun Celik, was taken from his car in the middle of the street shortly after he attended several days of meetings with western officials to discuss Kurdish political issues. The Council of Europe has already criticised Turkey for \"imprisoning elected leaders\", whom it believes were campaigning for peaceful reform. Meanwhile, a delegation from the European Union visited the Turkish foreign ministry yesterday to request further details of the charges against Hadep's members. Turkish prosecutors, however, say that they have evidence that the mayors were taking their instructions from the PKK, and supplying the rebel group with money. Ankara has criticised European politicians for siding with Hadep, and for meeting human rights groups during official visits to Turkey. \"[EU countries] have a plan to put us under greater pressure than before,\" the prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, said this week. \"But we will not play that game.\" The fear now is that the crackdown on Hadep could mark the end - at least temporarily - of the most peaceful period the south-east has experienced for a long time. After 15 years of conflict between the security forces and the PKK, a rebel ceasefire has been holding. \"It's very tense at the moment,\" said one Diyarbakir resident yesterday. \"People are worried about what might happen next.\" Hadep won significant popular support in the south-east in the last elections, but officials in Ankara have consistently refused to treat its party leaders as representatives of wider Kurdish political issues. The government believes that Hadep is a front for the PKK, and that time will prove its caution justified. \"Do we want to treat the PKK like the IRA, and Hadep like Sinn Fein in Northern Ireland?\" wrote a columnist, Mehmet Ali Kislali, in the Radikal newspaper. \"If that's what anyone expects, they are living in a fantasy world.\" Turkey's relations with the EU are bound to be negatively affected by the events of the last few days. Before Ankara can enter into formal negotiations with the EU, it has to satisfy what are known as the \"Copenhagen criteria\", which, among other things require the candidates to \"achieve stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities\". No one ever believed that Turkey's progress towards membership would be easy, but the first big bump in the road seems to have come much sooner than expected.",

It is said to be restoring the three stars lost by the Paris restaurant Le Grand V\u00e9four in 1983. For the past nine years the chef of the historic restaurant at the Palais Royal has been 43-year-old Guy Martin, who was promoted to top rank by the less cautious guides, such as Le Guide Pudlowski, as long ago as 1995.</p> <p>Anyone who has used Michelin regularly can't help but be sentimental about the thick red book. I remember my first meal in a three-star establishment. It was the early 70s and I was driving to the south of France with my mother. That night we were stopping in Tours, at a small hotel chosen from the guide because it had two towers (\"comfortable\").</p> <p>We walked to our dinner at Charles Barrier (now demoted to one star and under new ownership, following M Barrier's six months in prison in 1984, for destroying discarded bills paid in cash and failing to note their amounts in his accounts). Dressed to kill, we were shocked to see that our fellow diners were tie-less and shirt-sleeved. There was worse to come before the warm oysters with endives and the baby pigeon cooked with an infusion of thyme flowers, garlic and preserved cabbage. We didn't know whether to giggle or weep when the terrine de canard was served in its ceramic Donald Duck pot.</p> <p>Since then I have been led by Michelin to a two-star eatery in Digoin decorated with stalactites and stalagmites; a one-time three-star in Bordeaux that was a huge papier-mch\u00e9 grotto; and a hotel room in Paris with a lurid 60s orange carpet. It's only in the Michelin-rated upper echelons of hotels and restaurants that you are treated to this display of specifically French Bad Taste.</p> <p>The first restaurant guide was published in 1803; the next year Grimod de la Reyni\u00e8re's Almanach des Gourmands listed 500 restaurants in Paris. (Pretty rapid expansion, considering that the first use of the word \"restaurant\" was by Boulanger in 1765, and the first real one, Beauvillier's La Grande Taverne de Londres, only opened in 1782.)</p> <p>In 1900 the Michelin tyre company published its first motorist's guide to hotels and restaurants in France. The company also sponsored a gastronomic column in several newspapers, and for a time this was written, as \"Bibendum\", by Maurice Edmond Sailland (1872-1956), better known by his nom de fourchette , \"Curnonsky\". Michelin introduced its star ratings with a single star in 1926, then one to three in the 1931 edition.</p> <p>\"Because of difficulties of provisioning,\" says Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Mespl\u00e8de's Trois \u00c9toiles au Michelin, a history of three-star restaurants, \"the classification of three stars\" vanished with the 1939 edition, only to reappear after the war. The first three-star ratings were given in 1951, with three Paris restaurants (Caf\u00e9 de Paris, La Tour d'Argent and Lap\u00e9rouse) and four provincial ones (La M\u00e8re Brazier near Lyons, La Cte d'Or of Alexandre Dumaine at Saulieu, L'Auberge du P\u00e8re Bise at Talloire and La Pyramide of Fernand Point at Vienne).</p> <p>Last year there were 21 three-star eateries, as there were in 1981 and 1982 - the heyday of nouvelle cuisine. The new culinary phenomenon had been noticed as early as 1972, by Raymond Sokolov, who reported in the New York Times that a chef called Paul Bocuse was serving a new style of food in his restaurant near Lyons.</p> <p>The next year, two Paris journalists, Henri Gault and Christian Millau, christened the movement la nouvelle cuisine, and the guide that bore their names (founded in 1969) began to challenge Michelin for supremacy. Poor Fat Mich just didn't get it.</p> <p>Many of their three-stars, the Troisgros brothers, Barrier, Roger Verg\u00e9, Michel Gu\u00e9rard, and another eight chefs, were all practising a lighter sort of cooking with a new emphasis on the visual appearance of the food. Gault-Millau printed their names in red, to distinguish them from the traditional chefs printed in black. Michelin never did find a way to identify the nouvelle cuisine chefs. This wasn't so serious at the three-star level, as the chefs had become celebrities in their own right by the 80s, and punters knew what to expect from them.</p> <p>But if you took a chance on an unfamiliar two-star-or-less listing in Michelin you could not predict whether you would get what the American food writer Calvin Trillin called heavy-heavy stuff-stuff, or a food picture painted on your plate. As for those shabby places with great food we all treasure, the wordless Michelin symbols just don't have the means to convey such secrets.</p> <p>Then there was the issue of stars for the amenities of the restaurant. Having three stars had been a licence to print money; suddenly, in the late 90s, for the first time in the history of the guide, two three-stars went bust.</p> <p>Pierre Gagnaire at St Etienne and Marc Veyrat on Lake Annecy had borrowed and invested too much in their premises and furnishings. The third Michelin star seems always to have been awarded for surroundings and service as well as food, but in the 80s it seemed to many two-star restaurateurs that you could, in effect, buy your third star by investing in marble loos and expensive china. Every cook aspired to be a chef-patron and own an elaborately furnished dining room, plus some (high-profit) bedrooms and, if possible, like Georges Blanc at Vonnas, a heli-pad.</p> <p>For Blanc, whose mother before him had owned the premises, this was possible but heaven help the chef-patron paying rent - plus rates, and the social wage to the army of chefs and waiters needed to get and keep the third star. The chief reason there are so many good little places to eat in France and so relatively few here is that restaurants there are still usually a family business, the freehold owned and the family living off the business rather than paying themselves wages. It works differently at the top of the foodie chain.</p> <p>So who cares that the British Michelin is a joke by comparison, more useful for its (scrupulously checked) telephone numbers than its recommendations? There is only one (French) restaurant left in Britain with three stars, Michel Roux's Waterside Inn at Bray.</p> <p>Those terrors of the dining room, Marco Pierre White and Nico Ladenis, have handed back their three stars. They now have none; while Gordon Ramsay and Raymond Blanc have not achieved their ambitions to gain a third. Never mind that Blanc has been serving three-star nosh for years, and that the best high-end meal I ate last year was at Ramsay's.</p> <p>Of course, we British eat Indian or Chinese or Thai, given the choice, and Michelin's French-biased inspectors don't know which end of a samosa or a chopstick to hold. We shouldn't take it personally: the Michelin volumes for Germany, Italy and Spain are even worse. But the maps are great. And now that nouvelle cuisine is dead, the Guide Michelin France is again at least reliable. Many happy returns of the day, old man.</p>",

Many of their three-stars, the Troisgros brothers, Barrier, Roger Verg\u00e9, Michel Gu\u00e9rard, and another eight chefs, were all practising a lighter sort of cooking with a new emphasis on the visual appearance of the food. Gault-Millau printed their names in red, to distinguish them from the traditional chefs printed in black. Michelin never did find a way to identify the nouvelle cuisine chefs. This wasn't so serious at the three-star level, as the chefs had become celebrities in their own right by the 80s, and punters knew what to expect from them. But if you took a chance on an unfamiliar two-star-or-less listing in Michelin you could not predict whether you would get what the American food writer Calvin Trillin called heavy-heavy stuff-stuff, or a food picture painted on your plate. As for those shabby places with great food we all treasure, the wordless Michelin symbols just don't have the means to convey such secrets. Then there was the issue of stars for the amenities of the restaurant. Having three stars had been a licence to print money; suddenly, in the late 90s, for the first time in the history of the guide, two three-stars went bust. Pierre Gagnaire at St Etienne and Marc Veyrat on Lake Annecy had borrowed and invested too much in their premises and furnishings. The third Michelin star seems always to have been awarded for surroundings and service as well as food, but in the 80s it seemed to many two-star restaurateurs that you could, in effect, buy your third star by investing in marble loos and expensive china. Every cook aspired to be a chef-patron and own an elaborately furnished dining room, plus some (high-profit) bedrooms and, if possible, like Georges Blanc at Vonnas, a heli-pad. For Blanc, whose mother before him had owned the premises, this was possible but heaven help the chef-patron paying rent - plus rates, and the social wage to the army of chefs and waiters needed to get and keep the third star. The chief reason there are so many good little places to eat in France and so relatively few here is that restaurants there are still usually a family business, the freehold owned and the family living off the business rather than paying themselves wages. It works differently at the top of the foodie chain. So who cares that the British Michelin is a joke by comparison, more useful for its (scrupulously checked) telephone numbers than its recommendations? There is only one (French) restaurant left in Britain with three stars, Michel Roux's Waterside Inn at Bray. Those terrors of the dining room, Marco Pierre White and Nico Ladenis, have handed back their three stars. They now have none; while Gordon Ramsay and Raymond Blanc have not achieved their ambitions to gain a third. Never mind that Blanc has been serving three-star nosh for years, and that the best high-end meal I ate last year was at Ramsay's. Of course, we British eat Indian or Chinese or Thai, given the choice, and Michelin's French-biased inspectors don't know which end of a samosa or a chopstick to hold. We shouldn't take it personally: the Michelin volumes for Germany, Italy and Spain are even worse. But the maps are great. And now that nouvelle cuisine is dead, the Guide Michelin France is again at least reliable. Many happy returns of the day, old man.",

But the revelation last week that, despite separation by a barred gate, a couple locked in the cell area below Swansea Crown Court had managed to enjoy a sexual encounter while the guards were looking elsewhere, showed that you can lock people up, but you can't stop them doing what comes naturally if the opportunity arises.</p> <p>For most prisoners, however, a monk-like existence is the best that they can hope for as far as sex is concerned. Of course, it takes a strong will and a disciplined mind to understand the demands of the primal urge for any significant length of time. Long hours confined without the succour of human warmth serve only to intensify a sense of carnal deprivation.</p> <p>The landings of long-term prisons are littered with wan individuals, hollow-eyed through years of unrestrained masturbation. Pathetic maybe - but for those unable to master their instincts there are few options available from which to gain relief from the torment of Priapus. Some are reduced to desperate measures. One man I knew of some years ago found himself in an extremely embarrassing situation, as well as a painful one, after apparently attempting to achieve some pleasure from performing an act upon himself involving four RS20 batteries, taped together in a clump.</p> <p>The man ended up being rushed to an outside hospital when the tape came apart and two of the batteries were left lodged deep inside his colon. When news of his \"accident\" reached the wings ruthless jail wags christened him Torchy - and the name stuck for the remainder of his sentence. Likewise \"HP\" was utilising a sauce bottle in a similar manner when it broke.

      "bodyText": "Conjugal visits are unavailable for prisoners in British jails, officially that is. But the revelation last week that, despite separation by a barred gate, a couple locked in the cell area below Swansea Crown Court had managed to enjoy a sexual encounter while the guards were looking elsewhere, showed that you can lock people up, but you can't stop them doing what comes naturally if the opportunity arises. For most prisoners, however, a monk-like existence is the best that they can hope for as far as sex is concerned. Of course, it takes a strong will and a disciplined mind to understand the demands of the primal urge for any significant length of time. Long hours confined without the succour of human warmth serve only to intensify a sense of carnal deprivation. The landings of long-term prisons are littered with wan individuals, hollow-eyed through years of unrestrained masturbation. Pathetic maybe - but for those unable to master their instincts there are few options available from which to gain relief from the torment of Priapus. Some are reduced to desperate measures. One man I knew of some years ago found himself in an extremely embarrassing situation, as well as a painful one, after apparently attempting to achieve some pleasure from performing an act upon himself involving four RS20 batteries, taped together in a clump. The man ended up being rushed to an outside hospital when the tape came apart and two of the batteries were left lodged deep inside his colon. When news of his \"accident\" reached the wings ruthless jail wags christened him Torchy - and the name stuck for the remainder of his sentence. Likewise \"HP\" was utilising a sauce bottle in a similar manner when it broke. Heaven knows what the local hospital thought about what was going on in that prison. The \"married quarters\" (or, more crudely, Vaseline Alley) is the section of a wing or landing where men who prefer to adopt a gay lifestyle in private tend to congregate. The need for physical intimacy is so great that inhibitions may be sacrificed for the palliative effect of warm skin upon warm skin. Because not all who locate themselves within this community are necessarily full-time homosexuals. Some are \"jail gays\" only and often have wives or girlfriends who visit regularly, unaware of their imprisoned partner's complex coping strategy. Visiting-room sex also used to cause major headaches for the authorities. While most couples managed to confide their intimacies to discreet fumblings under tables, others were not so inhibited. I remember once in the visiting room of a maximum security prison a female visitor sat blatantly astride the man she was visiting, chatting and laughing while gently moving her hips backwards and forwards. Though nothing could be seen beneath the camouflage of her long dress, it did not take a great deal of imagination to work out what was going on. At the end of visiting time prisoners would form an orderly queue at one end of the room and visitors would form another at the other end by the exit. Both groups would remain in the room until everyone had been counted. On this particular occasion the visits ended and the two groups duly waited at either end of the room in silence - all except the amorous couple, who by then had become vigorously animated in their endeavour to achieve satisfaction. It was a surreal scene, made even more absurd when the action was over and the woman simply climbed off her partner, straightened her dress and walked briskly across the room to join the other visitors. The man stood up, adjusted his denims and then sauntered over to tag on to the end of the prisoners' queue. \"All complete!\" shouted the prison officer monitoring the prisoners, to his colleague standing by the visitors. \"Thank you, sir!\" came the reply. Once the control room had been informed by walkie-talkie that everyone in the visitoring room had been accounted for, the two groups vacated the premises in the usual way, as if nothing untoward had ever taken place. That was the old nature of prison visiting rooms, however. Such exhibitions are rare nowadays, what with CCTV and robust floor patrols. But the tensions generated by forced celibacy continue. Sadly, and perhaps surprisingly in view of the current social climate, the issue of how prisoners are meant to manage their sexual needs while incarcerated and later upon release remains unacknowledged by the authorities. An associate of mine, recently released after 18 years, was so concerned about the prospect of renewed sexual relations that shortly before his day of liberation he decided to broach the subject with the prison psychologist, a woman. \"What should I expect with regard to my first sexual experience?\" he asked sheepishly. \"What do you mean?\" replied the psychologist. \"Is there anything I should be aware of that might or, er, . . . might not happen,\" he said, even more sheepishly.

      "bodyText": "The London stock exchange is to create a new market to allow Barclays Global Investors to sell iShares, its new investment products. BGI, the fund management arm of Barclays which yesterday confirmed the creation of the new fund-cum-share, will be the first company to list products on the exchange's new Extramark once it has gained regulatory approval. Aimed at professional and private investors, iShares will be BGI's version of exchange-traded funds, which are a cross between shares and unit and investment trusts and already active in the United States and Canada, where more than $35bn is invested in similar investment products. \"iShares essentially try to combine the benefit of shares with the benefits of funds. \"They are simple from the perspective of the user,\" said John Demaine, director of iShares at BGI. BGI, one of the world's biggest index-tracking fund managers, will offer a number of iShares to track a range of stock market indices. As their name suggests, the iShares will trade like ordinary shares during normal exchange hours but give investors' exposure to more than one company. Private investors should be able to trade them through their internet broker, although Mr Demaine admitted iShares are more likely to interest pro fessional investors at first. The stock exchange aims to attract other companies to Extramark, which it describes as an \"attribute\" market designed to provide innovative new products. It is its second such market after the introduction of Techmark last year for technology stocks. \"Tracking an index helps to spread risk and exposes investors to a wider variety of companies, but can be difficult and expensive for most private investors to do on their own.\"",

The Goldfish operation, to be augmented by a dot.com business, has 1m customers and, according to Mark Clare, finance director, is worth \u00a3400m on a conventional valuation. Mr Gardner said the idea of offering - like Egg, the Prudential's online bank to be partially floated this year - a current account was \"pretty interesting\". It is clear an eventual float has been pencilled in. AA membership, Mr Gard ner said, rose to an all-time high of 9.7m and the motoring body's financial operations have been folded into Centrica's, making an operating profit of \u00a311m. More than 1,000 jobs in the AA have gone since Centrica bought it, with more likely to be shed. It now claims to be the UK's largest home and motor insurance intermediary with 1.6m policies. Mr Clare said the aim was to push non-energy sales to 40% of turnover within 10 years but British Gas lays claim to 14.8m gas customers and 2.8m electricity customers - netting 35,000 new contracts a week. The group, which aims to be the biggest electricity supplier, with 4m contracts by the end of the year, said lower prices and increased output from its own gas fields helped boost profits to \u00a3461m from \u00a3248m in 1998. The only blot on the horizon is global warming which knocked an estimated \u00a324m off last year's bottom line.",

We want to help the Co-operative in any we can to deal with its existing problems.\" </p> <p>He denied that trying to make the Co-operative more competitive with the big supermarkets would be difficult, given its strong association with the union. \"I don't think the co-operative is a patsy employer,\" he said. </p> <p>The commission's other members include Alan Donnelly, former leader of the European parliamentary Labour party, Mervyn Pedelty, chief executive of the Co-operative Bank and former trade minister Lord Simon of Highbury. </p> <p>However, the lack of retailing expertise among the commission members surprised industry experts. </p> <p>Richard Hyman, chairman of retail research firm Verdict, said: \"Is this a quasi-government inquiry? Why are there no retailers involved? Why are there only politicians looking to identify commercial opportunities? Because they are not good at that.\" </p> <p>Graham Melmoth, chief executive of the CWS, said: \"It's about the future and not the past. I think the process of mergers does continue and it's possible the commission will encourage more of this.\" </p> <p>He said the commission would look at the areas where the movement could improve its productivity and the possible cross-selling of products to members. Mr Melmoth said he put the idea of a commission to senior Labour party members last summer and in the past few months has held talks with Mr Blair. </p> <p>Mr Melmoth said the response from briefings to CRS members indicated the vote on Saturday week would be in favour of a merger. \"The fact that those members are, as far as we can tell, very persuaded, is very encouraging.\"</p>",

The CRS reported a loss of almost \u00a360m last year and it is expected that the commission could highlight the need for more mergers if the group is to capitalise on its huge asset base - which includes prop erty, retail shops, travel agencies, the Co-op bank and CIS insurance operation, and funeral parlours. Asked about the need for the review, Mr Monk said: \"I think the time is ripe for giving the plcs a run for their money. We want to help the Co-operative in any we can to deal with its existing problems.\" He denied that trying to make the Co-operative more competitive with the big supermarkets would be difficult, given its strong association with the union. \"I don't think the co-operative is a patsy employer,\" he said. The commission's other members include Alan Donnelly, former leader of the European parliamentary Labour party, Mervyn Pedelty, chief executive of the Co-operative Bank and former trade minister Lord Simon of Highbury. However, the lack of retailing expertise among the commission members surprised industry experts. Richard Hyman, chairman of retail research firm Verdict, said: \"Is this a quasi-government inquiry? Why are there no retailers involved? Why are there only politicians looking to identify commercial opportunities? Because they are not good at that.\" Graham Melmoth, chief executive of the CWS, said: \"It's about the future and not the past. I think the process of mergers does continue and it's possible the commission will encourage more of this.\" He said the commission would look at the areas where the movement could improve its productivity and the possible cross-selling of products to members. Mr Melmoth said he put the idea of a commission to senior Labour party members last summer and in the past few months has held talks with Mr Blair. Mr Melmoth said the response from briefings to CRS members indicated the vote on Saturday week would be in favour of a merger. \"The fact that those members are, as far as we can tell, very persuaded, is very encouraging.\"",

Combining the medieval idea of like curing like (snow was a folk remedy for chilblains, for example) with the notion that the more you dilute a tincture, the more potent it is, it has been under attack from the start. It was one of the first targets of the American Medical Association when it was formed in 1847. One of the few CM approaches born in this century is clinical ecology, or environmental medicine. Based on the idea that many disorders are caused by environmental factors, such as the relationship between food allergies and exposure to synthetic chemicals, it has no single founder. The term 'allergy' was coined by a Viennese paediatrician in 1906, and in the 20s several US doctors studied delayed or hidden reactions to food. Most of these systems almost vanished in the golden age of drugs after the last war, but began gradually to re-emerge in the 70s.",

The two unnamed ministers were not suspected of any security breaches but the former prime minister is believed to have thought they disagreed with her on policy matters, according to Mike Frost, a former Candadian agent. Mr Frost made the allegations to the American news programme 60 Minutes, according to released comments from the programe. Last night, no comment was available from Lady Thatcher but a spokeswoman for Number 10 said the government would draw the allegations to her attention. \"We will make sure Baroness Thatcher is aware of these allegations so she can judge whether they merit a response.\" Mr Frost, who said he worked for Canadian intelligence from 1972-1992, told the programme the five countries involved in the Echelon global surveillance system could get around domestic laws preventing spying by asking another member nation to do it for them. \"The British parliament now have total deniability,\" he said, referring to the alleged spying on the two ministers, whom he did not identify. \"They didn't do anything... We did it for them. \"[Thatcher] had two ministers that she said \"weren't 'on side'... so my boss went to London and did intercept traffic from those two ministers,\" Mr Frost told 60 Minutes, which is due to be broadcast in America on Sunday. The Echelon system, which is run by the US, Canada, Britain, Australia and New Zealand, is capable of intercepting phone conversations, faxes and e-mail messages around the world for any of the five countries involved in the network. Mr Frost's allegations come in the same week that a European parliament report said the Echelon surveillance network, a series of listening posts around the world, was used for industrial espionage. On Wednesday the government denied it used Echelon for industrial spying in Europe. Echelon was designed to eavesdrop on suspected terrorists, drug lords and governments hostile to the five members.Each member state has a \"dictionary\" of codewords which when they appear a certain number of times or in connection with other words, are monitored.

Moby Dick by Herman Melville</strong><br>I first read it at the age of 11, when I greatly enjoyed it, but found it a bit slow. Reading it again as an adult it had the same effect, but I had more patience for the slow discursive bits. Any novel that can be appreciated by such an age range is very impressive.</p> <p><strong>2. Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll</strong><br>It's a toss-up between them for the best all time children's book. I love them - I'll even watch the Disney Looking Glass film any chance I get. Ordered it up in a hotel during an acid trip.<br><strong><br>3. Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller</strong><br>My dad handed me this one when it was freshly unbanned in the US; I was about 16. \"You've got to read this!\" he said excitedly. Not for the dirty bits, though. \"What prose! What use of language!\" He was dead right.</p> <p><strong>4. The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch by Philip K Dick</strong><br>My favourite by both the best SF writer of all time and the best metaphysical novelist of all time.<br><strong><br>5. The Stars My Destination by Alfred Bester</strong><br>A stupendous novel that breaks entirely out of both the form and straight prose at the end and into something indescribable. His Golem 100 is even more radical, combining prose,poetry, collage, musical score, illustration, but it's not as successful on a narrative level.</p> <p><strong>6. Le Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine by Alexandre Dumas</strong><br>The ultimate cook book. 566 pages on how to cook anything, and I do mean ANYTHING, by the great French novelist and obsessive gourmet. Cook book as literature.</p> <p><strong>7. Looking for the Mahdi by N Lee Wood</strong><br>It admittedly takes chutzpah to choose a novel written by my own wife, but not as much chutzpah as it took a non-Arabic non-Muslim American woman to write an SF novel with a Palestinian-American heroine in the political atmosphere of the late 1980s.</p> <p><strong>8. The Once and Future King by TH White</strong><br>The best all time fantasy novel, for both literary form and inventiveness. I'm no big fan of Arthurian fantasy, but this one is written as if no one had done it before, and no one need bother since.</p> <p><strong>9. Thirty Six Views of Mt Fuji by Hokusai</strong><br>My all time favourite art book.</p> <p><strong>10. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain</strong><br>My favourite novel by one of my favourite writers. When I reread it recently, I was staggered by how contemporary it was a century after it was written. Here Twain not only invented the time-travel novel and the alternate history novel, but worked out all the paradoxes and techniques. And in a serious-minded comic novel whose humour remains sharp as a scalpel and still crazy after all these years.</p>",

The Stars My Destination by Alfred Bester A stupendous novel that breaks entirely out of both the form and straight prose at the end and into something indescribable. His Golem 100 is even more radical, combining prose,poetry, collage, musical score, illustration, but it's not as successful on a narrative level. 6. Le Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine by Alexandre Dumas The ultimate cook book. 566 pages on how to cook anything, and I do mean ANYTHING, by the great French novelist and obsessive gourmet. Cook book as literature. 7. Looking for the Mahdi by N Lee Wood It admittedly takes chutzpah to choose a novel written by my own wife, but not as much chutzpah as it took a non-Arabic non-Muslim American woman to write an SF novel with a Palestinian-American heroine in the political atmosphere of the late 1980s. 8. The Once and Future King by TH White The best all time fantasy novel, for both literary form and inventiveness. I'm no big fan of Arthurian fantasy, but this one is written as if no one had done it before, and no one need bother since. 9. Thirty Six Views of Mt Fuji by Hokusai My all time favourite art book. 10. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain My favourite novel by one of my favourite writers. When I reread it recently, I was staggered by how contemporary it was a century after it was written. Here Twain not only invented the time-travel novel and the alternate history novel, but worked out all the paradoxes and techniques. And in a serious-minded comic novel whose humour remains sharp as a scalpel and still crazy after all these years.",

She shows her violence to stem, in part, from her domestic background: her common-law father beats her mother who, in turn, is driven to retaliatory killing. Prix is also the product of a culture in which male, middle-aged violence is either exculpated or seen as the social norm. But, just when you think Corthron is going soft on her heroine, she reminds you that she is an extremely cold fish: while in jail she rehearses a deeply sincere speech for the benefit of her captors - \"my home was violent, my teachers suspicious, potential employers uninterested\" - that she herself greets with derisive laughter. </p> <p>Corthron pins down the mixed motives that drive teenage gangsters; she also shows how they are supplanted by even more ruthless successors. But, while Corthron brings Prix to vivid life, she too often lets her gift for language run away with her: a counselling session, for instance, spools on, adding sociological rather than dramatic information. She also provides a number of false endings so that the play constantly seems to be reaching a climax. </p> <p>Indeed, my one criticism of Gemma Bodinetz's excellent production, which I saw at a last preview in the handsomely restored Jerwood Theatre Upstairs, is that it treats Prix's park-square Fourth of July firework display too much as a climactic spectacle.
