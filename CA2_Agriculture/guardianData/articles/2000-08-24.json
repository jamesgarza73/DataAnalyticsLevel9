Coloured spotlights sweep the stage as various session musicians and backing singers assemble. Does Jamelia make the flamboyant entrance worthy of a young R'n'B diva? No; she creeps in from the side, grinning bashfully. She looks fantastic, though: a vision in diamante, and her vocals cut smoothly and sweetly through a funky opener. </p> <p>Jamelia's set draws on her well-received album, Drama; the problem, however, is that drama is what she lacks. Things really go awry when she performs Call Me. It has a plush soul melody, with a sharply-choreographed video. Onstage, however, we're distracted by Jamelia's pubescent backing dancers, bounding all over the stage (and the song) like excitable puppies, affecting \"manly\" expressions. Luckily, they disappear for a bit after that, but the awkwardness persists. Although Jamelia exudes charm, vacillating from American vocals to introduce numbers in Birmingham brogue, she can't bring herself to make eye contact with the audience. </p> <p>Choosing this glamorous club venue for Jamelia's debut is a mistake; its age restrictions exclude the kids who buy her records (although, sadly, it hasn't deterred her backing dancers). Jamelia is essentially a pop star. She's an approachable pin-up and sings catchy tunes, but certain moments during this show almost swallow themselves with self- consciousness. Like when Jamelia raps that her \"Room 101\" is \"a little hideaway that nobody knows\" (so it's not an Orwellian nightmare, then). Or when a wooden guest vocalist joins her to cover Barbra Streisand's Guilty; he gets his chest out, but at least he looks past the age of consent. </p> <p>Jamelia plays her Baroque-swingbeat hit Money as an encore (with ragga hero Beenie Man on backing tapes), but she's clearly had more enjoyable appearances on CDUK. She'll prove she's capable of greater things when she performs with a tighter ensemble to a more responsive pop crowd. Right now, merely emulating American acts makes British R'n'B more shopping precinct than ghetto fabulous.</p>",

The new rule was introduced by the banking industry to help customers remember their personal identification numbers so that they do not write them down, thereby increasing the risk of this information falling into the wrong hands. </p> <p>All banks and building societies subscribing to the voluntary code of banking practice were supposed by July 1 this year to allow customers to change their Pin number to one which they select themselves. Most have complied but 21 have not yet carried out the necessary IT systems changes to allow this to happen, said the BCSB, which monitors compliance with the code. </p> <p>The institutions were given the deadline three years ago, and the public have the right to know which institutions have not met it, the watchdog said. The change was made following pressure from consumer groups. </p> <p>The 21 institutions have been set new deadlines ranging from October this year to March 31 2001. Several million Lloyds TSB customers with debit cards are among those affected, though its credit card holders and former customers of TSB are unaffected. More than 2m Bank of Scotland customers will also be unable to choose their own Pin for another few months.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Twenty-one banks and building societies were yesterday named by a financial watchdog for failing to meet a deadline for allowing customers to choose their own personal identification numbers for their debit and credit cards. The 21 include Lloyds TSB, Bank of Scotland, Sainsbury's Bank and Bradford &amp; Bingley building society. Yesterday's announcement by the Banking Code Standards Board coincides with renewed debate about banking security and card fraud. The new rule was introduced by the banking industry to help customers remember their personal identification numbers so that they do not write them down, thereby increasing the risk of this information falling into the wrong hands. All banks and building societies subscribing to the voluntary code of banking practice were supposed by July 1 this year to allow customers to change their Pin number to one which they select themselves. Most have complied but 21 have not yet carried out the necessary IT systems changes to allow this to happen, said the BCSB, which monitors compliance with the code. The institutions were given the deadline three years ago, and the public have the right to know which institutions have not met it, the watchdog said. The change was made following pressure from consumer groups. The 21 institutions have been set new deadlines ranging from October this year to March 31 2001. Several million Lloyds TSB customers with debit cards are among those affected, though its credit card holders and former customers of TSB are unaffected. More than 2m Bank of Scotland customers will also be unable to choose their own Pin for another few months.",

      "body": "<p>In the end last night was one of wild celebration in the Toon as goals from two home debutants and a forgotten man beat a stubborn Derby side. Not even the dismissal of Warren Barton for hauling back Deon Burton or Seth Johnson's late second could spoil the party. </p> <p>Summer building work has increased the capacity to more than 52,000 and Tyneside hosted its largest crowd since 1973 with the darling of the Gallowgate that day, Malcolm Macdonald, back to mark the occasion. It was clear they expected Derby, without six regulars, to be torn apart - Rams to the slaughter. </p> <p>The breathtaking start suggested as much. With four minutes gone Kieron Dyer fed Nolberto Solano down the right. The Peruvian tricked his way past Danny Higginbotham and crossed for Carl Cort who, under challenge from Otto Bragstad, headed into the corner of the net. </p> <p>But, while the Newcastle whirlwind continued to rage, it rapidly blew out of control. Burton might have levelled had Nicos Dabizas not intevened and, when United did emerge from midfield with the ball, Solano's pass was just too strong for the on-rushing Dyer. </p> <p>Rhythm was further disrupted by Cort's withdrawal after the half-hour as County's midfield steadily took control. Stefano Eranio teased his way past two players before curling an effort over the bar and Burton should have done better moments later when through on goal. </p> <p>The crowd, starved of their goal feast, vented their frustrations. Their disappointment was complete on the stroke of half-time as Johnson's innocuous ball into the area caught the home defence dithering and Branko Strupar calmly placed an equaliser beyond Shay Given. </p> <p>But parity was retained only for the duration of the interval. A minute after the break Stephen Glass's cross was half-cleared by the beleaguered Bragstad and Cordone nipped in to restore United's lead. </p> <p>This time there would be no revival. Glass, who spent most of last season on the treatment table or the transfer list and was seizing his chance with some glee, saw to that by curling a magnificent left-foot shot into the top corner from 30 yards. </p> <p>Higginbotham's last ditch challenge prevented Alan Shearer adding a fourth but Derby's defence had long since descended into blind panic. Macdonald must have fancied his chances.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the end last night was one of wild celebration in the Toon as goals from two home debutants and a forgotten man beat a stubborn Derby side. Not even the dismissal of Warren Barton for hauling back Deon Burton or Seth Johnson's late second could spoil the party. Summer building work has increased the capacity to more than 52,000 and Tyneside hosted its largest crowd since 1973 with the darling of the Gallowgate that day, Malcolm Macdonald, back to mark the occasion. It was clear they expected Derby, without six regulars, to be torn apart - Rams to the slaughter. The breathtaking start suggested as much. With four minutes gone Kieron Dyer fed Nolberto Solano down the right. The Peruvian tricked his way past Danny Higginbotham and crossed for Carl Cort who, under challenge from Otto Bragstad, headed into the corner of the net. But, while the Newcastle whirlwind continued to rage, it rapidly blew out of control. Burton might have levelled had Nicos Dabizas not intevened and, when United did emerge from midfield with the ball, Solano's pass was just too strong for the on-rushing Dyer. Rhythm was further disrupted by Cort's withdrawal after the half-hour as County's midfield steadily took control. Stefano Eranio teased his way past two players before curling an effort over the bar and Burton should have done better moments later when through on goal. The crowd, starved of their goal feast, vented their frustrations. Their disappointment was complete on the stroke of half-time as Johnson's innocuous ball into the area caught the home defence dithering and Branko Strupar calmly placed an equaliser beyond Shay Given. But parity was retained only for the duration of the interval. A minute after the break Stephen Glass's cross was half-cleared by the beleaguered Bragstad and Cordone nipped in to restore United's lead. This time there would be no revival. Glass, who spent most of last season on the treatment table or the transfer list and was seizing his chance with some glee, saw to that by curling a magnificent left-foot shot into the top corner from 30 yards. Higginbotham's last ditch challenge prevented Alan Shearer adding a fourth but Derby's defence had long since descended into blind panic. Macdonald must have fancied his chances.",

Given that a hip ailment has restricted him to fewer than 100 championship overs, Lewis has been about as useful as Banquo's ghost, and only marginally more visible. Patience is thinning. </p> <p>\"It'll all come out in the wash,\" said Leicestershire's coach Jack Birkenshaw, somewhat obliquely. One can only guess whether Lewis is seeking revenge for a perceived slight, trying to earn a few bob for his dotage or has genuine cause to shatter English cricket's holier-than-thou self-image.</p>",

Now he has promised, should he make a century, to grow a beard of Sherwood Forest proportions, so the abrupt end to his sturdy knock, bowled by Glen Chapple, was bad news for those despairing of the current rash of slapheads and hankering after the new WG. After the way Kumble bowled, mind, that upper lip may soon be restored to its familiar shrubbery. Playing into Crawley's deft hands, he strayed all too frequently to leg and waited 19 overs for his sole wicket. Perhaps this novel attempt to reverse the Samson principle is wearing off. Amid it all buzzed the Chris Lewis grapevine. The former England all-rounder is said to be so fed up with what he sees as the reluctance of officialdom to take his allegations of bookmaker approaches seriously that he is threatening to retire in order to \"write\" a book naming the England players he was asked to approach by a bookmaker. Not that Leicestershire would be distraught. Given that a hip ailment has restricted him to fewer than 100 championship overs, Lewis has been about as useful as Banquo's ghost, and only marginally more visible. Patience is thinning. \"It'll all come out in the wash,\" said Leicestershire's coach Jack Birkenshaw, somewhat obliquely. One can only guess whether Lewis is seeking revenge for a perceived slight, trying to earn a few bob for his dotage or has genuine cause to shatter English cricket's holier-than-thou self-image.",

      "body": "<p>The belief that overcrowding in southern England is caused by migration from the north is scotched today by a fresh analysis of population trends from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an independent research body. </p> <p>It shows that the most powerful motor of population growth in the southern counties is the flight of relatively prosperous families from suburban London. </p> <p>People moving out of the capital were responsible for 50% of the population growth elsewhere in the south between 1991 and 1998, whereas migration from the north, midlands, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales accounted for only 8%, the researchers said. </p> <p>Other factors explaining a 623,000 increase in the southern population outside London over the period were a higher than expected birth rate and immigration. </p> <p>The report said an extra 4.3m households would need accommodation in the UK by 2021. The demand for homes would fall disproportionately on the south-east, where the population was expected to grow by 50,000 a year, putting pressure on greenfield sites. </p> <p>But a continuing middle class exodus from London would not reduce its population, because it had a high birth rate and it was the main destination for migration from within and beyond the EU. </p> <p>London's migrant population was expected to increase by 31,000 a year for the foreseeable future and would include extremes of rich and poor. This would put pressure on central London house prices and increase demand for affordable \"social\" housing for rent. </p> <p>The report accepted that there had been some population drift from north to south. Net migration from the north and west midlands was about 30,000 people a year during the 1990s, although this was expected to fall. </p> <p>A more significant trend was a move in all regions from towns and cities to the suburbs and rural areas. This had not been one-way traffic. Typically 500,000 left the cities each year and 400,000 moved in. </p> <p>\"There is a clear life cycle feature, with net movement by people aged 15-19 out of almost all regions and into London,\" the report said. \"However, London is shedding people in all other age groups, and this net outward movement is on a much bigger scale than any other kind of migration.\" </p> <p>Those moving out tended to be relatively wealthy families with children, or retiring couples. </p> <p>Richard Best, the foundation's director and joint editor of the report, said: \"The decline of great cities is a national problem demanding action to regain and retain economically active people on the scale urged by Lord Rogers and his urban task force. </p> <p>\"But our analysis shows that attempts to achieve an 'urban renaissance' by blocking migration from north to south would be misconceived. Most movement from cities only takes people as far as the suburbs and surrounding areas. </p> <p>\"There is no escaping the conclusion that population pressures will remain intense in the southern regions, and that London will be unable to meet all its housing needs within its own boundaries.\" </p> <p> On the Move: Housing consequences of migration, edited by Richard Bate, Richard Best and Alan Holmanis; Joseph Rowntree Foundation; \u00a313.95</p>",

      "bodyText": "The belief that overcrowding in southern England is caused by migration from the north is scotched today by a fresh analysis of population trends from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an independent research body. It shows that the most powerful motor of population growth in the southern counties is the flight of relatively prosperous families from suburban London. People moving out of the capital were responsible for 50% of the population growth elsewhere in the south between 1991 and 1998, whereas migration from the north, midlands, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales accounted for only 8%, the researchers said. Other factors explaining a 623,000 increase in the southern population outside London over the period were a higher than expected birth rate and immigration. The report said an extra 4.3m households would need accommodation in the UK by 2021. The demand for homes would fall disproportionately on the south-east, where the population was expected to grow by 50,000 a year, putting pressure on greenfield sites. But a continuing middle class exodus from London would not reduce its population, because it had a high birth rate and it was the main destination for migration from within and beyond the EU. London's migrant population was expected to increase by 31,000 a year for the foreseeable future and would include extremes of rich and poor. This would put pressure on central London house prices and increase demand for affordable \"social\" housing for rent. The report accepted that there had been some population drift from north to south. Net migration from the north and west midlands was about 30,000 people a year during the 1990s, although this was expected to fall. A more significant trend was a move in all regions from towns and cities to the suburbs and rural areas. This had not been one-way traffic. Typically 500,000 left the cities each year and 400,000 moved in. \"There is a clear life cycle feature, with net movement by people aged 15-19 out of almost all regions and into London,\" the report said. \"However, London is shedding people in all other age groups, and this net outward movement is on a much bigger scale than any other kind of migration.\" Those moving out tended to be relatively wealthy families with children, or retiring couples. Richard Best, the foundation's director and joint editor of the report, said: \"The decline of great cities is a national problem demanding action to regain and retain economically active people on the scale urged by Lord Rogers and his urban task force. \"But our analysis shows that attempts to achieve an 'urban renaissance' by blocking migration from north to south would be misconceived. Most movement from cities only takes people as far as the suburbs and surrounding areas. \"There is no escaping the conclusion that population pressures will remain intense in the southern regions, and that London will be unable to meet all its housing needs within its own boundaries.\" On the Move: Housing consequences of migration, edited by Richard Bate, Richard Best and Alan Holmanis; Joseph Rowntree Foundation; \u00a313.95",

In German, the corresponding figures were 63% of girls and 49.1% of boys, while in Spanish the figures were 65.8% for girls and 51% for boys.</p> <p>This year the most popular GCSE subject continued to be maths, which was taken by 673,056 candidates and accounted for around one-eighth of all the entries.</p> <p>In maths, 3% of boys were awarded A*, up from 2.6% last year, while girls achieved 2.6%, up from 2.1%.</p> <p>Close behind was English, with 647,436 entrants. Here, girls achieved 3.7% of A* grades in English, compared with 2% for boys, while they also picked up more As, Bs and Cs. Entries in the more traditional GCSE subjects such as biology, chemistry, physics, history and modern languages remain strong, while art continues to be the most popular examination subject outside the national curriculum, attracting 201,296 entries. But there was a slump in entries in geography and home economics.</p> <p>The subject most likely to attract the A* grade this year was again Greek. This time it was taken by only 934 candidates but nearly half of them got the top grade.</p> <p>Entries for information technology were increasing significantly at all levels and types of qualification, the results show, reflecting recognition of the importance of computer skills in today's workplace.</p> <p>At GCSE, for example, IT had the biggest single rise in any one subject with a 10% leap in full course entries on last year, and a corresponding 8% increase in short course entries.</p> <p>The exam boards also reported that numbers of entries for GCSE short courses increased year on year by 20,698 to 275,751. They are designed to be the same standard as a full GCSE, but take half the study time.</p> <p>Short course subjects with the biggest increases in entries include religious education and information technology. Despite an overall decline in registrations for GNVQs, there was a sizeable increase in part one GNVQ entries, available to schools only last year.</p> <p>Congratulating candidates on the results, the school standards minister, Estelle Morris, urged young people to consider staying on in further or higher education rather than quitting.</p> <p>\"There are plenty of opportunities to progress to higher qualifications and a more secure future,\" she said, \"whether in full-time education at school or college, an apprenticeship or other vocational learning.\"</p> <p>Paul Sokoloff, convenor of the joint council, commented: \"The good GCSE results this year are a testimony to the hard work of students and teachers, who deserve congratulations.</p> <p>\"The increase in entries for GCSE, short course GCSE and part one GNVQ is good news, showing that students are taking a broader range of subjects at 16, particularly those they see as relevant to today's world. Awarding bodies will continue to innovate and to provide qualifications to meet the needs of a changing society\".</p> <p>The Professional Association of Teachers welcomed the small rise in standards at GCSE and urged critics to give credit to pupils and their teachers.</p> <p>But the PAT general secretary called for a large scale inquiry into gender differences .</p> <p>\"At university - where there are more male than female lecturers and few senior women academics - male students still gain more first class degrees, while in the workplace men still dominate the top jobs in the professions, academia, politics and business,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Even in schools, where women outnumber men, 80 per cent of secondary school headships are held by men\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "Girls are outperforming boys both at the top grades and across subjects, it was confirmed last night after the publication of the first GCSE results broken down by gender. Even in mathematics - the only subject where boys won more A* grades than girls - achievement by the two sexes was broadly the same, the exam boards said. The joint council for general qualifications last night published details of examination results on behalf of the regional boards not only for GCSEs, but also for GCSE short courses, certificates of achievement and the vocational part one, and foundation and intermediate GNVQs. The figures confirmed that youngsters took more exams than the previous year - the number of GCSE entries increased by 5.4%, compared with an increase in the number of 15- to 16-year-olds of just 2%. The results published by the awarding bodies and released to candidates today cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland relate to all entrants regardless of their age or where they took the exam. Overall, the percentage of candidates achieving A* to C in full GCSE courses rose to 56.6% from last year's figure of 55.7%. Last week's A-level results showed girls getting more A grades than boys for the first time, triggering a national debate about boys' so-called under-achievement. The breakdown in GCSE results according to gender reveals some interesting trends within individual subjects. In modern languages, for example, girls showed superior linguistic skills to their male classmates in contrast with this year's A-level results where boys' performance was ahead. In GCSE French, 60.1% of girls got a grade C or higher, compared with 44.5% of boys. In German, the corresponding figures were 63% of girls and 49.1% of boys, while in Spanish the figures were 65.8% for girls and 51% for boys. This year the most popular GCSE subject continued to be maths, which was taken by 673,056 candidates and accounted for around one-eighth of all the entries. In maths, 3% of boys were awarded A*, up from 2.6% last year, while girls achieved 2.6%, up from 2.1%. Close behind was English, with 647,436 entrants. Here, girls achieved 3.7% of A* grades in English, compared with 2% for boys, while they also picked up more As, Bs and Cs. Entries in the more traditional GCSE subjects such as biology, chemistry, physics, history and modern languages remain strong, while art continues to be the most popular examination subject outside the national curriculum, attracting 201,296 entries. But there was a slump in entries in geography and home economics. The subject most likely to attract the A* grade this year was again Greek. This time it was taken by only 934 candidates but nearly half of them got the top grade. Entries for information technology were increasing significantly at all levels and types of qualification, the results show, reflecting recognition of the importance of computer skills in today's workplace. At GCSE, for example, IT had the biggest single rise in any one subject with a 10% leap in full course entries on last year, and a corresponding 8% increase in short course entries. The exam boards also reported that numbers of entries for GCSE short courses increased year on year by 20,698 to 275,751. They are designed to be the same standard as a full GCSE, but take half the study time. Short course subjects with the biggest increases in entries include religious education and information technology. Despite an overall decline in registrations for GNVQs, there was a sizeable increase in part one GNVQ entries, available to schools only last year. Congratulating candidates on the results, the school standards minister, Estelle Morris, urged young people to consider staying on in further or higher education rather than quitting. \"There are plenty of opportunities to progress to higher qualifications and a more secure future,\" she said, \"whether in full-time education at school or college, an apprenticeship or other vocational learning.\" Paul Sokoloff, convenor of the joint council, commented: \"The good GCSE results this year are a testimony to the hard work of students and teachers, who deserve congratulations. \"The increase in entries for GCSE, short course GCSE and part one GNVQ is good news, showing that students are taking a broader range of subjects at 16, particularly those they see as relevant to today's world. Awarding bodies will continue to innovate and to provide qualifications to meet the needs of a changing society\". The Professional Association of Teachers welcomed the small rise in standards at GCSE and urged critics to give credit to pupils and their teachers. But the PAT general secretary called for a large scale inquiry into gender differences . \"At university - where there are more male than female lecturers and few senior women academics - male students still gain more first class degrees, while in the workplace men still dominate the top jobs in the professions, academia, politics and business,\" she said. \"Even in schools, where women outnumber men, 80 per cent of secondary school headships are held by men\".",

The commission's response is that Camelot's probity was compromised by its problems with software supplied by the US firm GTech. Camelot suffered a software glitch which resulted in some players being short-changed over a four-year period up to 1998.

Faced with two bidders for the next seven-year licence to run the lucrative game, the commission ruled out both the present operator, Camelot, and its challenger, Sir Richard Branson's People's Lottery (of which our retiring managing director, Caroline Marland, is a non-executive director). Camelot was rejected on three grounds: doubts about its software; concern over its breaches of its current licence, which could still lead to fines; and \"unresolved concern\" over the propriety of its arrangements with GTech, the American software firm, against which there have been serious allegations over lottery licences obtained in the US. </p> <p>Dame Helena Shovelton, chairwoman of the commission, told reporters that despite reservations over the Branson bid, her members would now proceed with a new single bidder process, negotiating with his consortium about its shortcomings. This looked like the best of all possible worlds: Camelot, with its history of fat cat payments to directors, rejected; Branson's consortium told to improve its bid. But when reporters asked what would happen if the new negotiations failed, Dame Helena suggested negotiations with Camelot could be reopened. Given her earlier damning rejection, this looked illogical and unfeasible. But there is one reason for keeping the door open to Camelot: with no other bidder around - no Littlewoods or Ladbrokes this time - it maintains the pressure on Sir Richard to improve his bid. </p> <p>Unlike her hapless predecessor, Dame Helena, an experienced audit commissioner, is proving a hard-nosed regulator. The evaluation has involved 2m words of evidence and 360 checks on the 100 companies involved in the two bids. We hope Branson wins: a not-for-profit consortium is more in tune with charitable goals. But the licence has to be earned.</p>",

Camelot was rejected on three grounds: doubts about its software; concern over its breaches of its current licence, which could still lead to fines; and \"unresolved concern\" over the propriety of its arrangements with GTech, the American software firm, against which there have been serious allegations over lottery licences obtained in the US. Dame Helena Shovelton, chairwoman of the commission, told reporters that despite reservations over the Branson bid, her members would now proceed with a new single bidder process, negotiating with his consortium about its shortcomings. This looked like the best of all possible worlds: Camelot, with its history of fat cat payments to directors, rejected; Branson's consortium told to improve its bid. But when reporters asked what would happen if the new negotiations failed, Dame Helena suggested negotiations with Camelot could be reopened. Given her earlier damning rejection, this looked illogical and unfeasible. But there is one reason for keeping the door open to Camelot: with no other bidder around - no Littlewoods or Ladbrokes this time - it maintains the pressure on Sir Richard to improve his bid. Unlike her hapless predecessor, Dame Helena, an experienced audit commissioner, is proving a hard-nosed regulator. The evaluation has involved 2m words of evidence and 360 checks on the 100 companies involved in the two bids. We hope Branson wins: a not-for-profit consortium is more in tune with charitable goals. But the licence has to be earned.",

      "bodyText": "The return to prison of Johnny \"Mad Dog\" Adair may have been welcomed by law-abiding citizens in Northern Ireland, but he was the last person the prison officers at Maghaberry jail wanted to see. Loyalist paramilitaries have threatened action against prison officers and their families unless segregation is introduced at the County Antrim jail. The prison operates a policy of integration, with loyalist and republican prisoners living side by side with other inmates. Sources with an intimate knowledge of Maghaberry said yesterday that staff feared he would become a rallying point for the loyalist prisoners, who are demanding the same rights as they were given inside the Maze. Following the suspension of his licence for early release, Adair was dragged from his car on the Shankill road on Monday night by officers from the RUC's SAS-trained headquarters mobile support unit. He was driven to Girdwood Barracks in Belfast, and flown to Maghaberry in a helicopter. Once hailed as a model prison, Maghaberry has become a powder keg since the Good Friday agreement was signed. It was built to house \"good honest criminals\" not associated with terrorism, but members of paramilitary groups convicted or charged after the agreement have been sent there instead of the Maze, due to close in the autumn. About 120 of the jail's 493 prisoners are affiliated to the Ulster Freedom Fighters and Loyalist Volunteer Force, a breakaway group set up by the infamous Portadown loyalist Billy Wright, who was shot dead in the Maze prison by the INLA two days after Christmas in 1997. It was a spokesman for the LVF prisoners, who do not qualify for early release as the terrorist organisation has not declared a ceasefire, who issued the threat against the prison staff and their families. Since Adair was freed from the Maze last September after serving five years of a 16-year sentence for directing terrorism, he has tried to forge close links with the LVF to muscle in on the lucrative drugs trade in Portadown. Adair has publicly aligned himself with the LVF prisoners' demands, and prison sources fear a worsening of the violence that has already seen more than 60 officers injured in Maghaberry this year and several petrol bomb attacks on their homes. But the prison authorities are adamant that they will not introduce the policies that resulted in the Maze being run by inmates. The Maze was a home from home for Adair, who even had a mobile phone to direct operations on the streets of Belfast. Maghaberry remains a much stricter regime than the H blocks. Yesterday the Northern Ireland prison service stressed that mobile phones were not tolerated in the jail and that Adair would be afforded no special privileges.",

      "bodyText": "A Sikh police officer wrongfully accused of sending racist hate mail to himself and his colleagues was racially discriminated against by the Metropolitan police, an employment tribunal found yesterday. There was no evidence to show that Sergeant Gurpal Virdi was responsible for racist letters distributed within the Ealing division of the Metropolitan police in December 1997 and January 1998, the tribunal said. It also found that he was the subject of racial discrimination by the police force during its investigation of him. Mr Virdi, 41, was sacked in March after an internal disciplinary panel decided he had sent racist hate mail to himself and other black and Asian staff. The letters, delivered by the Met's internal mail system, told the officers to leave the force and were signed with the initials of the National Front. Some of the messages were allegedly linked to his computer. In April 1998 his home was searched by police and he was suspended. The hearing concluded that Mr Virdi, who had 16 years unblemished service in the Met, was motivated by frustration after being turned down for promotion and was planning a claim of racial discrimination against the force. The Sikh officer, who gave evidence of racism in the Met at the Stephen Lawrence inquiry, claimed he was framed and discriminated against after challenging white officers on race crime and threatening to expose them. The tribunal found yesterday that during the investigation Mr Virdi was treated differently to a white female officer, PC Jackie Bachelor, who was also a suspect in the investigation. It found that as well as the search of his home, the Met at tempted to entrap Mr Virdi in a taped interview in February 1998 and failed to interview him in an informal way as it did PC Bachelor. It concluded: \"The explanations put forward by the respondents, the Metropolitan police, as representing good investigation practice are not sustainable or justifiable. \"We therefore infer and conclude that the reason for their failures is not incompetence but is because of Sergeant Virdi's race.\" Speaking after the decision, a delighted Mr Virdi said: \"It is a very sad day for the Metropolitan police again.

The doughty Dame Helena Shovelton and her four lottery commissioners put paid to the bidder's ambitions, and it seems certain that Camelot's chief executive-designate, Dianne Thompson, will have to lay down her amulet. Her \u00a3334,000-a-year job was conditional on the bid's success. </p> <p>Camelot was muttering darkly about taking the decision to judicial review last night. But it seems certain that its lottery dream is over: 800 staff, spread around 13 sites, face an uncertain future. Camelot is a one-trick pony, a consortium formed specifically to run Britain's national lottery. Without the licence to run the contest, it is game over for Camelot. </p> <p><strong> Ignominious</strong><br> </p> <p> The end is as ignominious as the beginning was glorious. The birth of the national lottery in 1994 was one of the most successful product launches ever. With the It Could Be You slogan, devised by Saatchi and Saatchi, Camelot ensured maximum publicity and Saturday night queues at supermakets, petrol stations and corner shops around the country. It captured the national imagination and even now, after interest has waned, six out of 10 adults regularly participate. </p> <p>It was not just a commercial success: the consortium was hailed as the saviour of rural retail industry. Installing thousands of simple-to-operate machines in retailers all over the country ensured a weekly influx that boosted grocery sales and saved some stores from certain closure. Soon, the cash started to flow to arts organisations and sporting groups across the nation. And later, landmark projects such as Tate Modern in London and the Dynamic Earth exhibition in Edinburgh emerged as the crowning glory of the lottery's achievements. The lottery was doing everything it said it would, delivering millions to good causes, uniting the nation in a shared philanthropic experience and, whisper it, sending huge profits the way of Camelot shareholders. </p> <p>But behind the sweet successes lay bitter acrimony. Early on, there were concerns over the process of awarding the lottery to Camelot. The first lottery regulator, Peter Davis, was criticised for accepting hospitality and free trips from the Camelot partner GTech, and concerns have been raised about Camelot's profits, which have topped \u00a370m a year. </p> <p>Chris Smith, the culture secretary, had an early showdown with Camelot bosses over \"fat cat\" pay, but the embarrassing encounter was swept under the carpet when Camelot agreed to pay an unspecified amount to charity. More recently, ICL, one of the Camelot partners, dropped its long-planned flotation on the stock exchange. </p> <p>But it was, in the end, the developer of that technology that was to prove the undoing of Camelot. GTech, the most successful lottery operator in the world and in the early days a shareholder in Camelot, came up with the software that links up the network of lottery machines. From the start, there were concerns that GTech's business practices were not all they should have been. And it was GTech's cover-up of a problem with its lauded software system that eventually put paid to Camelot, despite Gtech's chief executive, president and principal PR man falling on their swords. </p> <p>Since then, a new board structure has been put in place at GTech, and Camelot has pledged to exert tighter controls. But it was not enough for the commissioners. \"The commission ... decided that, given the inability of both GTech's board and Camelot to ensure proper behaviour by GTech's most senior executives in the past, it could not presently be satisfied that the arrangements proposed by Camelot were sufficiently likely to secure that the national lottery would be run with all due propriety for it to accept Camelot's application and award it a seven-year licence,\" they said. </p> <p>It is a hard pill for Camelot to swallow. The commissioners, however, are adamant they have taken the right decision. They are still to rule on what sanctions Camelot should suffer for breaching its licence over the software fiasco, and the commissioners feel they could not hand a seven-year contract to the consortium with that particular cloud hanging over it. </p> <p>The conspiracy theorists have also been having a field day. One suggestion yesterday was that the commissioners wanted to delay handing the contract to Branson for a month to give them time to review the damaging allegations expected in a forthcoming book about Britain's favourite business tycoon. </p> <p>As the champagne corks popped in Holland Park and the winds of Hurricane Debby eased to allow safe passage home from the Caribbean for Sir Richard, Camelot's executives were left spluttering their disgust. Camelot has said in the past that, should it lose the bid, it would not stand in the way of a smooth handover. But such is the acrimony over the way the end has been hailed, it seems unlikely that the mists will fall quietly around this Camelot.</p>",

The lottery was doing everything it said it would, delivering millions to good causes, uniting the nation in a shared philanthropic experience and, whisper it, sending huge profits the way of Camelot shareholders. But behind the sweet successes lay bitter acrimony. Early on, there were concerns over the process of awarding the lottery to Camelot. The first lottery regulator, Peter Davis, was criticised for accepting hospitality and free trips from the Camelot partner GTech, and concerns have been raised about Camelot's profits, which have topped \u00a370m a year. Chris Smith, the culture secretary, had an early showdown with Camelot bosses over \"fat cat\" pay, but the embarrassing encounter was swept under the carpet when Camelot agreed to pay an unspecified amount to charity. More recently, ICL, one of the Camelot partners, dropped its long-planned flotation on the stock exchange. But it was, in the end, the developer of that technology that was to prove the undoing of Camelot. GTech, the most successful lottery operator in the world and in the early days a shareholder in Camelot, came up with the software that links up the network of lottery machines. From the start, there were concerns that GTech's business practices were not all they should have been. And it was GTech's cover-up of a problem with its lauded software system that eventually put paid to Camelot, despite Gtech's chief executive, president and principal PR man falling on their swords. Since then, a new board structure has been put in place at GTech, and Camelot has pledged to exert tighter controls. But it was not enough for the commissioners. \"The commission ... decided that, given the inability of both GTech's board and Camelot to ensure proper behaviour by GTech's most senior executives in the past, it could not presently be satisfied that the arrangements proposed by Camelot were sufficiently likely to secure that the national lottery would be run with all due propriety for it to accept Camelot's application and award it a seven-year licence,\" they said. It is a hard pill for Camelot to swallow. The commissioners, however, are adamant they have taken the right decision. They are still to rule on what sanctions Camelot should suffer for breaching its licence over the software fiasco, and the commissioners feel they could not hand a seven-year contract to the consortium with that particular cloud hanging over it. The conspiracy theorists have also been having a field day. One suggestion yesterday was that the commissioners wanted to delay handing the contract to Branson for a month to give them time to review the damaging allegations expected in a forthcoming book about Britain's favourite business tycoon. As the champagne corks popped in Holland Park and the winds of Hurricane Debby eased to allow safe passage home from the Caribbean for Sir Richard, Camelot's executives were left spluttering their disgust. Camelot has said in the past that, should it lose the bid, it would not stand in the way of a smooth handover. But such is the acrimony over the way the end has been hailed, it seems unlikely that the mists will fall quietly around this Camelot.",

      "body": "<p><strong>SAME AGAIN</strong></p> <p>In the aftermath of England's Euro 2000 shambles, Kelvin Koogan faced a baying press-pack that smelt blood. His blood. \"It's all your fault Koog!\" the Fiver howled, although Brian Woolnough's lacquered bouffant was in our way and probably filtered out much of our venom. In any case, Koog ignored us. Instead, he concentrated his fire on that good-for-nothing bunch of wasters that made up his squad. \"The last thing I am going to do is say anything detrimental about the players in the hotel,\" Koog said conspiratorially. \"But we were not good enough.\"</p> <p>At last the man has started making some sense, thought the Fiver, and we were so relieved we wept. And this time it was with joy. So imagine our shock when we found out that cuddly Kelv has named the same failures in his 28 man squad to face France next week! A whopping 20 out of the 22 man Euro 2000 squad are kept in - only Shearer and Richard Wright aren't there - and Koog's only attempt at experimentation is recalling Rio Ferdinand, Kieron Dyer, Andy Cole and the injury-free Darren Anderton. Which isn't much at all. </p> <p>\"I still believe we have the players,\" Koogan said today, deftly ignoring his Euro 2000 debriefing. \"I can find good enough reasons not to experiment for this game.\" Thirty seconds later he found one. \"This one game against France is the only one I have to prepare for the qualifiers against Germany and Finland and I need to get this right,\" Koog spluttered. But surely there will be some change, at left-back perhaps? Don't bet on it. \"Because of the shortage of time together and the fact you never get the chance to play a settled side you don't get a chance to experiment,\" Koog concluded, as the sighs and moans around the country grew louder and louder.</p> <p>The full squad: Seaman, Martyn, James; P Neville, G Neville, Barry, Adams (capt), Keown, Campbell, Southgate, Ferdinand, Gerrard, Dyer, Wise, Barmby, Ince, Anderton, McManaman, Heskey, Owen, Phillips, Cole, Beckham, Scholes.</p> <p><strong>PENNY DROPS ONTO CAMEL'S BACK CAUSING UNTOLD DAMAGE</strong></p> <p>It's taken Steve McManaman a while to figure out that Real Madrid don't want him any more. The Spanish giants forked out \u00a343m for a player who plays in the same position as him, but he didn't bat an eyelid. He was told by his manager that he has little or no chance of playing first-team football this season, and he couldn't even be bothered to shrug insouciantly. When the entire Real squad was ordered to stand outside his house at three in the morning and scream \"bugger off back to Liverpool you scruffy scouse get\" through large paper cones, Steve did not wake up.</p> <p>But now the penny seems to have finally dropped, the camel's back has been broken, etc., and so on. Because Macca has been left out of the Real squad for tomorrow's Super Cup clash with Galatasaray, and he's not happy. \"I deserve respect,\" a seething McManaman told Spanish paper Marca this morning. \"They should have to give an explanation about why I am not travelling to Monaco, but nobody has given it to me.\" The normally placid flopster didn't stop there, either. \"I need to play,\" he ranted. \"I want to play for England in the next World Cup and therefore my situation is very complicated. I am going to speak with my agent to study the situation and make the decision which suits me best.\"</p> <p>Now, we could be wrong, but this may signal some frenetic transfer activity as a host of top clubs - and Middlesbrough - battle for his signature. But even though Macca looks to have accepted his situation, he's still desperately clinging on to the hope that Real will learn to love him again. \"Nobody has told me that Real wants to sell me,\" he insisted, \"and until somebody says it to me, I will not consider leaving.\" Let's hope he sets his alarm for 2.59am before he goes to bed this evening, or this could go on for ever.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"We've got to look to professional referees.

Twenty-four hours later and Ferg has completely changed his mind. \"I feel really sorry for referees now,\" he said today having had time to think about it. \"It is hard for them to determine what is a tackle and what is not a tackle.

      "body": "<p>New security procedures may soon make it safer to use your Visa card or MasterCard online than in person. From next April, all Visa card and MasterCard holders in the UK will have to give out a three-digit security number printed on the card signature strip during online and telephone based transactions. As an additional means of identification, they will also have to give their house name or number and postcode . </p> <p>The security number is calculated from your card's 16-digit number and other numeric data unique to your account. In theory, only cash machines, electronic point of sale machines and your card issuer's computer systems can confirm this number. </p> <p>Credit card fraud in the UK cost a staggering \u00a3189m last year, and is rising. </p> <p>Stolen till rolls or restaurant receipts are all that is needed for someone to take your card number and expiry date and then use your details for buying goods over the telephone or online. Alternatively, your card details can easily, and quickly, be copied by a less than scrupulous shop assistant using a simple magnetic strip reader costing around \u00a350. These gizmos, when hooked up to a laptop computer - which could easily be under the checkout - can record all of the existing data on your card. But they will not be able to record the new security number as it is printed on your signature strip. </p> <p>Thanks to the new security number, known as the card verification value, and the extra identification checks, Visa and MasterCard say it will be easier for online merchants and telephone mail-order houses to spot fraudulent card activity. </p> <p>Some UK online retailers, most notably Quip (<a href=\"http://www.quip.co.uk\">www.quip.co.uk</a>), the discount telecoms company, have already implemented the card verfication value and house number safeguards, so if you do find these details requested when you make a transaction over the phone or online, rest assured that it's for your own protection. If, on the other hand, you see a shop assistant or waiter noting down the card verfication value or other data from the signature strip of your card, alarm bells should start ringing in your head. Don't be afraid of asking for an explanation and if necessary calling for the manager. </p> <p> The \"consumer tips\" section on Visa's main website (which is at <a href=\"http://www.visa.com/ct\">www.visa.com/ct</a>) has a useful selection of dos and don'ts for when using your card at a retailer, online or at a cash machine. </p> <p>Many recommendations are commonsense, but some are less than obvious, such as cancelling a cash machine transaction at any stage if you see anything suspicious about the machine, a simple procedure that can save a lot of hassle. </p> <p>Visa also recommends that you don't let your card out of your sight in a shop or a restaurant. Although this can involve a trip to the till from your table, the minor inconvenience could save a lot of grief further down the line. </p> <p>Not all problematic transactions are fraudulent. Suppose you order a product online and nothing arrives at all. Or, perhaps, the product arrives, but your bill is for more than you agreed. Unravelling these messes takes time and effort, not to mention a lot of brain strain. </p> <p>Now a new web-based service aims to solve these problems by providing a service which allows you to prove to your card issuer - and to the online retailer - what really happened. The Card-Guard (<a href=\"http://www.card-guard.com\">www.card-guard.com</a>) service allows all types of e-commerce transactions, including Switch and Visa Delta, to be securely recorded on a your PC for later playback. </p> <p>The Card-Guard software sits in the background on your PC, recording any transactions you make. Copies of these transactions are then encrypted and saved to your hard disk. </p> <p>If a dispute occurs, you simply send a copy of the encrypted transaction to Card-Guard. The firm then allows you secure access to the decrypted copy. Basically, if something goes wrong with a transaction you can prove your side of the story. </p> <p>The service is free to use except when users retrieve their encrypted transaction records from the company's servers, for which it charges a modest fee. </p> <p>There are currently two ways of paying for this service: a pay-as-you-go model at \u00a35.50 per retrieved transaction or an annual subscription model for prepaid transaction retrievals. </p> <p>The first charging model allows users to test the service and, if nothing goes wrong with any of your online transactions, you won't have to pay a penny. </p> <p>Under the subscription model, users can pay either \u00a317.50 or \u00a335 a year for, respectively, 10 or 20 free transaction retrievals in that given year. </p> <p>Plans are also in the pipeline for the company to develop an approved retailers programme on its site.

      "bodyText": "New security procedures may soon make it safer to use your Visa card or MasterCard online than in person. From next April, all Visa card and MasterCard holders in the UK will have to give out a three-digit security number printed on the card signature strip during online and telephone based transactions. As an additional means of identification, they will also have to give their house name or number and postcode . The security number is calculated from your card's 16-digit number and other numeric data unique to your account. In theory, only cash machines, electronic point of sale machines and your card issuer's computer systems can confirm this number. Credit card fraud in the UK cost a staggering \u00a3189m last year, and is rising. Stolen till rolls or restaurant receipts are all that is needed for someone to take your card number and expiry date and then use your details for buying goods over the telephone or online. Alternatively, your card details can easily, and quickly, be copied by a less than scrupulous shop assistant using a simple magnetic strip reader costing around \u00a350. These gizmos, when hooked up to a laptop computer - which could easily be under the checkout - can record all of the existing data on your card. But they will not be able to record the new security number as it is printed on your signature strip. Thanks to the new security number, known as the card verification value, and the extra identification checks, Visa and MasterCard say it will be easier for online merchants and telephone mail-order houses to spot fraudulent card activity. Some UK online retailers, most notably Quip (www.quip.co.uk), the discount telecoms company, have already implemented the card verfication value and house number safeguards, so if you do find these details requested when you make a transaction over the phone or online, rest assured that it's for your own protection. If, on the other hand, you see a shop assistant or waiter noting down the card verfication value or other data from the signature strip of your card, alarm bells should start ringing in your head. Don't be afraid of asking for an explanation and if necessary calling for the manager. The \"consumer tips\" section on Visa's main website (which is at www.visa.com/ct) has a useful selection of dos and don'ts for when using your card at a retailer, online or at a cash machine. Many recommendations are commonsense, but some are less than obvious, such as cancelling a cash machine transaction at any stage if you see anything suspicious about the machine, a simple procedure that can save a lot of hassle. Visa also recommends that you don't let your card out of your sight in a shop or a restaurant. Although this can involve a trip to the till from your table, the minor inconvenience could save a lot of grief further down the line. Not all problematic transactions are fraudulent. Suppose you order a product online and nothing arrives at all. Or, perhaps, the product arrives, but your bill is for more than you agreed. Unravelling these messes takes time and effort, not to mention a lot of brain strain. Now a new web-based service aims to solve these problems by providing a service which allows you to prove to your card issuer - and to the online retailer - what really happened. The Card-Guard (www.card-guard.com) service allows all types of e-commerce transactions, including Switch and Visa Delta, to be securely recorded on a your PC for later playback. The Card-Guard software sits in the background on your PC, recording any transactions you make. Copies of these transactions are then encrypted and saved to your hard disk. If a dispute occurs, you simply send a copy of the encrypted transaction to Card-Guard. The firm then allows you secure access to the decrypted copy. Basically, if something goes wrong with a transaction you can prove your side of the story. The service is free to use except when users retrieve their encrypted transaction records from the company's servers, for which it charges a modest fee. There are currently two ways of paying for this service: a pay-as-you-go model at \u00a35.50 per retrieved transaction or an annual subscription model for prepaid transaction retrievals. The first charging model allows users to test the service and, if nothing goes wrong with any of your online transactions, you won't have to pay a penny. Under the subscription model, users can pay either \u00a317.50 or \u00a335 a year for, respectively, 10 or 20 free transaction retrievals in that given year. Plans are also in the pipeline for the company to develop an approved retailers programme on its site. Under the programmme, users will be assured of a basic level of service from such approved retailers. Users will get confirmation of their orders by e-mail and several other guaranteed services. These are basic features which many e-commerce sites ignore at their peril. Card safety \u0095 Ensure that you get your credit card back after every purchase. If possible, do not let it out of your sight. \u0095 Never give your card number over the phone, unless you are dealing with a reputable company or you have initiated the call yourself. \u0095 If you feel pressured by a tele-marketing salesperson, be suspicious and never give out your account number unless you've decided to make a purchase. \u0095 Do not volunteer any personal information when you use your card. \u0095 After completing an ATM or Debit transaction, remember to take your card and, if provided, your transaction record \u0095Make sure that anyone waiting to use a cash machine after you cannot see you entering your PIN or transaction amount. \u0095 Never write down your PIN - memorise it. And never disclose it to anyone. No one from a financial institution or the police should ask for it. Nor should a retailer. You are the only person who should know it. \u0095 When selecting a PIN, avoid the obvious such as your name, telephone number, or date of birth. \u0095 If your card becomes stuck inside a cash machine, be suspicious of anyone offering help, even if they appear to be a bank security officer.

We wanted to share our experiences and our information,\" said a Scotland Yard source. </p> <p>The British embassy in Prague yesterday also confirmed that there had been \"contact\" between senior detectives in both countries. </p> <p>The Foreign Office is advising Britons against holiday and non-essential travel to Prague between September 23 and September 28. The US state department has also advised Americans not to visit the city at the end of September. </p> <p>Although the Czech interior ministry has told Prague's residents to \"relax and put your faith in the authorities\", the build-up to the summit has convinced many that violence in inevitable. </p> <p>Eleven thousand police have been assigned to the event and 5,000 soldiers will be on standby. </p> <p>The health ministry has warned Prague's four main hospitals to prepare for the worst. They are taking on extra staff and will be stocked with drugs to combat biological and chemical attacks. </p> <p>Keeping wounded delegates and protesters apart is another practical concern. </p> <p>\"If you have the delegates in one room and the protesters in another, they could fight in the corridor,\" warned a doctor at the Kralovske Vinohrady Teaching Hospital, which has set aside three luxury bedrooms for high profile financiers. </p> <p>Fast food restaurants have already ordered replacement panes of glass, knowing they are likely to be targeted. </p> <p>Managers of the supermarket chain, Tesco, which has a large branch in the centre of Prague, say they are considering closing during the summit. </p> <p>Schools and theatres in the centre of the capital have been ordered to close and Prague residents have been advised it may be wise to leave the capital or stock up on medicines and food and stay at home. </p> <p>Tabloid newspapers have added to the growing alarm by telling people to barricade their doors and windows against the \"barbarian protesters.\" </p> <p>Around 800 safety vests are to be handed out to journalists covering the summit, which is due to be attended by 23,000 delegates and politicians. </p> <p>Scores of British protesters have already moved to Prague and hundreds more are expected to arrive in the next fortnight. </p> <p>In the recent demonstrations in Britain and the US, police were accused of underestimating the resourcefulness and determination of the demonstrators and of showing little understanding of the loose-knit groupings suspected of masterminding the violence. </p> <p>Most police attention has focused on a coalition of Czech environmental, human rights and anarchist groups, called Inpeg, Initiative Against Economic Globalisation, which plans a counter summit at the same time as the financial meeting. But Inpeg has described the police's plans as \"hysterical\" and insist it is preparing \"non-violent activist training.\" </p> <p>With growing trepidation, the police have also been monitoring the numerous websites that have sprung up in recent weeks urging protesters to head for Prague. One of the websites, called DestroyIMF, urges participation in S26 - the demonstrators' nickname for the event. </p> <p>\"We're going to Prague to make the IMF summit in September 2000 into Seattle II. The IMF summit will be protected by a Czech police operation run by the FBI. The challenge to the workers' movement is to shutdown that summit with the biggest demo Europe has ever seen.\" </p> <p>It adds: \"We don't just want to disrupt their summits - we want to scrap the profit system that allows institutions like the World Bank, the IMF and WTO to rule the world and the former Stalinist countries. We want to end debt, poverty and capitalist exploitation. This site is a protest portal.\" Protesters have been advised of the Czech for useful phrases such as \"You fascist pig\" and \"Where is the nearest McDonalds?\" </p> <p>Police are also worried that protesters will target a new nuclear power plant in Bohemia which is due to be activated around the time of the IMF conference. </p> <p>The Czech president, Vaclev Havel, has tried to downplay concern, criticising the coverage given to security arrangements. He said: \"It is as if we were getting ready for a civil war.\" </p> <p> <strong> A world of protest against the global economy</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> June 18 1999</strong> </p> <p>Demonstrations were held in 27 cities worldwide, from the Czech Republic to Nigeria, in what was dubbed the \"global carnival against capital\". </p> <p>In the City of London, the 3,000-strong peaceful protest turned into the worst riots seen in the capital since the poll tax demonstration of 1990, resulting in 46 people needing hospital treatment and an estimated bill of more than \u00a35m. </p> <p><strong> November 30 1999</strong> </p> <p>The biggest protest in the US since the Vietnam war took place on the streets of Seattle, where the World Trade Organisation was meeting. </p> <p>An estimated 100,000 people protested peacefully until masked activists hijacked the demonstration and police in full riot gear responded with teargas and rubber pellets. </p> <p>A smaller protest of 2,000 people at Euston station in London led to 40 arrests. </p> <p><strong> April 16-17 2000</strong> </p> <p>Anti-globalisation protesters descended on Washington to disrupt meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Between 6,000 and 10,000 people managed to close the American capital for six hours and the human chain prevented some finance ministers from getting to their meetings. </p> <p>Largely peaceful but violent clashes with police officers - many in riot gear, which had them being compared to Power Rangers - resulted in 600 arrests. </p> <p><strong> May 1 2000</strong> </p> <p>May Day protests took place around the world. In London, where 4,000 people took to the streets, activists performed \"guerrilla gardening\" in Parliament Square and daubed paint and graffiti on monuments. What had been planned as peaceful protests ended in ugly scenes and 42 arrests. </p> <p><strong> August 15 2000</strong> </p> <p>Rubber bullets were fired by police in Los Angeles at the end of a protest concert by the band Rage Against the Machine.

The Foreign Office is advising Britons against holiday and non-essential travel to Prague between September 23 and September 28. The US state department has also advised Americans not to visit the city at the end of September. Although the Czech interior ministry has told Prague's residents to \"relax and put your faith in the authorities\", the build-up to the summit has convinced many that violence in inevitable. Eleven thousand police have been assigned to the event and 5,000 soldiers will be on standby. The health ministry has warned Prague's four main hospitals to prepare for the worst. They are taking on extra staff and will be stocked with drugs to combat biological and chemical attacks. Keeping wounded delegates and protesters apart is another practical concern. \"If you have the delegates in one room and the protesters in another, they could fight in the corridor,\" warned a doctor at the Kralovske Vinohrady Teaching Hospital, which has set aside three luxury bedrooms for high profile financiers. Fast food restaurants have already ordered replacement panes of glass, knowing they are likely to be targeted. Managers of the supermarket chain, Tesco, which has a large branch in the centre of Prague, say they are considering closing during the summit. Schools and theatres in the centre of the capital have been ordered to close and Prague residents have been advised it may be wise to leave the capital or stock up on medicines and food and stay at home. Tabloid newspapers have added to the growing alarm by telling people to barricade their doors and windows against the \"barbarian protesters.\" Around 800 safety vests are to be handed out to journalists covering the summit, which is due to be attended by 23,000 delegates and politicians. Scores of British protesters have already moved to Prague and hundreds more are expected to arrive in the next fortnight. In the recent demonstrations in Britain and the US, police were accused of underestimating the resourcefulness and determination of the demonstrators and of showing little understanding of the loose-knit groupings suspected of masterminding the violence. Most police attention has focused on a coalition of Czech environmental, human rights and anarchist groups, called Inpeg, Initiative Against Economic Globalisation, which plans a counter summit at the same time as the financial meeting. But Inpeg has described the police's plans as \"hysterical\" and insist it is preparing \"non-violent activist training.\" With growing trepidation, the police have also been monitoring the numerous websites that have sprung up in recent weeks urging protesters to head for Prague. One of the websites, called DestroyIMF, urges participation in S26 - the demonstrators' nickname for the event. \"We're going to Prague to make the IMF summit in September 2000 into Seattle II. The IMF summit will be protected by a Czech police operation run by the FBI. The challenge to the workers' movement is to shutdown that summit with the biggest demo Europe has ever seen.\" It adds: \"We don't just want to disrupt their summits - we want to scrap the profit system that allows institutions like the World Bank, the IMF and WTO to rule the world and the former Stalinist countries. We want to end debt, poverty and capitalist exploitation. This site is a protest portal.\" Protesters have been advised of the Czech for useful phrases such as \"You fascist pig\" and \"Where is the nearest McDonalds?\" Police are also worried that protesters will target a new nuclear power plant in Bohemia which is due to be activated around the time of the IMF conference. The Czech president, Vaclev Havel, has tried to downplay concern, criticising the coverage given to security arrangements. He said: \"It is as if we were getting ready for a civil war.\" A world of protest against the global economy June 18 1999 Demonstrations were held in 27 cities worldwide, from the Czech Republic to Nigeria, in what was dubbed the \"global carnival against capital\". In the City of London, the 3,000-strong peaceful protest turned into the worst riots seen in the capital since the poll tax demonstration of 1990, resulting in 46 people needing hospital treatment and an estimated bill of more than \u00a35m. November 30 1999 The biggest protest in the US since the Vietnam war took place on the streets of Seattle, where the World Trade Organisation was meeting. An estimated 100,000 people protested peacefully until masked activists hijacked the demonstration and police in full riot gear responded with teargas and rubber pellets. A smaller protest of 2,000 people at Euston station in London led to 40 arrests. April 16-17 2000 Anti-globalisation protesters descended on Washington to disrupt meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Between 6,000 and 10,000 people managed to close the American capital for six hours and the human chain prevented some finance ministers from getting to their meetings. Largely peaceful but violent clashes with police officers - many in riot gear, which had them being compared to Power Rangers - resulted in 600 arrests. May 1 2000 May Day protests took place around the world. In London, where 4,000 people took to the streets, activists performed \"guerrilla gardening\" in Parliament Square and daubed paint and graffiti on monuments. What had been planned as peaceful protests ended in ugly scenes and 42 arrests. August 15 2000 Rubber bullets were fired by police in Los Angeles at the end of a protest concert by the band Rage Against the Machine. A total of 39 people were arrested in four days in a series of protests against corporate greed. Sally James Gregory",

      "bodyText": "Divers have retrieved the two \"black box\" recorders from the Gulf Air Airbus A320 which crashed into the sea last night, killing all 143 people on board, an airline official said today. The rescue teams, which included US Navy helicopters and destroyers, managed to reach the wreckage of the plane - lying in shallow waters a few miles off the northern coast of Bahrain - within hours, but there were no survivors. Two Britons and 36 children are among those who died on board GF072, an evening flight from Cairo to Manama. Relatives spent the morning identifying victims of the crash from photos taken after all the bodies were recovered. There was no immediate word on what caused the crash. Ali Ahmadi, a Gulf Air vice president, said investigations have begun, but Bahraini officials will wait for experts from France's Airbus Industrie and the US-based national transportation safety board for a more thorough probe. The aircraft, which Gulf Air said was carrying 135 passengers and eight crew, crashed north of Bahrain airport at about 5.30pm yesterday. Most of the passengers were Arab nationals - including 63 Egyptians, 34 Bahrainis, 12 Saudi Arabians, nine Palestinians, six United Arab Emirates nationals, a Kuwaiti and an Omani. There were also two Britons, an Australian, a Canadian, three Chinese people, one Sudanese national and a Korean. There were also unconfirmed reports that one of the passengers was a US diplomatic courier. It is not yet known why flight GF072 crashed but an air traffic controller at Bahrain airport described watching from the tower as the plane circled the runway twice in an attempt to land, then on the third attempt plunged into the sea and exploded into flames. The controller, who asked to remain anonymous, saw no sign of trouble before the crash and said the plane's crew had not reported anything out of the ordinary. However, the ministry of transportation in Bahrain released a statement saying reports of an engine fire was \"pure speculation\". The statement said: \"It appeared that the aircraft had made two previous attempts to land and as it was turning to make another approach, it veered into the sea. \"Contrary to some initial reports, suggestions that an engine was on fire is pure speculation. The Air Traffic Control recordings confirm the crew made no distress call.\" US navy helicopters based in Bahrain, the home of the US fifth fleet, joined the rescue operation last night, according to a Pentagon spokesman, Bryan Whitman.

He was bailed on the condition that he lived with his brother Philip in Wimbledon, south-west London, and was also given permission to stay with a friend on Teesside so he could watch Saturday's match against Leeds United at the Riverside Stadium. Mr Shayler appeared calm and relaxed as he stood in the dock of court one at Bow Street magistrates court, central London. Outside the court he said he was \"very glad\" the legal process had got under way, adding: \"I'm very glad that the magistrate was sympathetic enough to me to let go and see Middlesbrough.\" He faces two charges of breaking section one of the 1989 Official Secrets Act, over an article in the Mail on Sunday in which he made allegations about his former employer, MI5. In the article, he claimed that security chiefs had kept files on prominent Labour politicians, including Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson, Home Secretary Jack Straw - who was described as a \"communist sympathiser\" - and had also kept files on former Beatle John Lennon and punk band the Sex Pistols. The formal charge read: \"On or before the 24th day of August 1997 within the jurisdiction of the Central Criminal Court being a person who has been a member of the security and intelligence services without lawful authority disclosed documents relating to security or intelligence which were in your possession by virtue of your position.\" Mr Shayler's solicitor John Wadham, of the civil rights group Liberty, told the magistrate that the 34-year-old former agent would be pleading not guilty at a later hearing. Mr Shayler claims that his allegations were made in the public interest and did not damage national security. New European human rights legislation, that will become part of English law in October, may provide him with a defence against the charges. Mr Shayler, 34, was arrested by Special Branch officers at Dover on Monday after returning from three years self-imposed \"political exile\" in France, and immediately taken to Charing Cross police station where he was charged and released on bail. The charges do not include the more serious allegations Mr Shayler went on to make in the media, including claims that MI6 was behind a bungled plot to assassinate Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi that left several civilians dead.",

There is a recall for Tottenham's Darren Anderton, currently free from injury, and a promotion for Tony Adams who, as predicted, takes over from Shearer as England captain. David James also reclaims the position of third choice keeper ahead of Richard Wright. Elsewhere however, change is notable by its absence.</p> <p>There is space in the 28-man squad for both Neville brothers, as well as old-timers like Paul Ince, Dennis Wise and David Seaman. Of the younger generation, only Gareth Barry, Kieron Dyer and Steven Gerrard have made the grade - two of whom were selected for Euro 2000.</p> <p>Keegan defended his cautious selection at a press conference this afternoon. \"I can find good enough reasons not to experiment for this game,\" he said. \"This one game against France is the only one I have to prepare for the qualifiers against Germany and Finland and I need to get this right.\"</p> <p>Keegan refused to be downbeat following England's failure in Holland and Belgium and remains confident that his team can prove their ability on the international stage. \"I still believe we have the players. We didn't perform at Euro 2000 as a team,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We see the ability every week in the Premiership, playing well in excellent sides, but because of the shortage of time together and the fact you never get the chance to play a settled side you don't get a chance to experiment.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Andy Cole has been given the chance to stake his claim as Alan Shearer's successor after he was called into Kevin Keegan's England squad for the friendly against France in Paris on Saturday week. Cole is one of the few changes from the squad that Keegan unsuccessfully took to Euro 2000. There is a recall for Tottenham's Darren Anderton, currently free from injury, and a promotion for Tony Adams who, as predicted, takes over from Shearer as England captain. David James also reclaims the position of third choice keeper ahead of Richard Wright. Elsewhere however, change is notable by its absence. There is space in the 28-man squad for both Neville brothers, as well as old-timers like Paul Ince, Dennis Wise and David Seaman. Of the younger generation, only Gareth Barry, Kieron Dyer and Steven Gerrard have made the grade - two of whom were selected for Euro 2000. Keegan defended his cautious selection at a press conference this afternoon. \"I can find good enough reasons not to experiment for this game,\" he said. \"This one game against France is the only one I have to prepare for the qualifiers against Germany and Finland and I need to get this right.\" Keegan refused to be downbeat following England's failure in Holland and Belgium and remains confident that his team can prove their ability on the international stage. \"I still believe we have the players. We didn't perform at Euro 2000 as a team,\" he said. \"We see the ability every week in the Premiership, playing well in excellent sides, but because of the shortage of time together and the fact you never get the chance to play a settled side you don't get a chance to experiment.\"",

As the machine was now out of warranty he'd have to pay for the work himself. McCarthy reminded them of the engineer's all clear and Epson then seized on this as proof that, \"as previously stated\", no fault had been found with the printer.

No, the DVLA couldn't tell him why, but said that the vehicle certifications agency would oblige. </p> <p>The VCA, alas, refuses to speak to the public and referred him back to the DVLA - which said its lips were sealed. Eventually he was directed to single vehicle approval which exists for vehicles not approved under EU manufacturing regulations and is based on a quota of 50 vehicles a year. Munjee then had to fork out an extra \u00a360 to have his brand-new EU-manufactured van registered this way. \"The inspector who carried out the test was surprised when I showed him my certificate of conformity and Renault UK confirmed the paperwork was legal and correct,\" he says. \"I wonder how many other people importing vehicles privately are put through all this.\" </p> <p><strong> \u0095The difficulty, according to the DVLA, is that vehicles have to conform to UK safety stan dards.

England start with two Tests against Pakistan, at Lord's (May 17-21) and Old Trafford (May 31-June 4). The three-way NatWest one-day competition, also involving Australia, starts on June 7, with the final at Lord's on June 23. Then England try to regain the Ashes from Australia, who have held them since 1989. The five Tests are at Edgbaston (July 5-9), Lord's (July 19-23), Trent Bridge (August 2-6), Headingley (August 16-20), and The Oval (August 23-27). Those last two Tests start on successive Thursdays, in an attempt to cram three matches into the prime holiday month of August. It will be the first time England have played back-to-back Tests at home since 1912.</p> <p><strong>I am trying to complete my collection of Wisden Almanacks. Where would be the best place to start looking, and would they be expensive? </strong></p> <p>The Wisden office in Guildford (Tel: 01483 570358) has most recent back issues dating from around 1980. If you want older Almanacks, your best bet would be to try a specialist cricket-book dealer. A list of them appears each year in Wisden - in the 2000 book it's on page 1565. You might well find that the early editions are rather expensive, and a cheaper alternative might be to contact the Willows Publishing Company (17 The Willows, Stone, Staffordshire ST15 0DE), who have produced facsimile editions of the early years of Wisden.</p> <p><strong>What are England's international dates this winter? </strong></p> <p>After the \"Mini World Cup\" in Kenya, England are making their first tour of Pakistan since 1987-88. They will be making a nervous return to the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad, scene of the ugly incident between Mike Gatting and umpire Shakoor Rana which disfigured that last tour. There will be three one-day internationals - at Karachi (Oct 24), Lahore (Oct 27) and Rawalpindi (Oct 29) - followed by three Tests, at Lahore (Nov 15-19), Faisalabad (Nov 29-Dec 3), and Karachi (Dec 7-11). After a break for Christmas, England undertake a similar programme in Sri Lanka. The Tests will be at Galle (Feb 22-26), Kandy (March 7-11) and Colombo (March 15-19), and the ODIs will all be in Colombo (March 23, 25 and 27).</p> <p><strong>When was the last time England won a Test series in Pakistan? </strong></p> <p>England have only won one series in Pakistan - indeed they have only ever won one Test there, the first one played, at Lahore in 1961-62. Ted Dexter was England's captain in that series, which England won 1-0: he finished with 66 not out as his side reached 209-5 to win by five wickets, and in the third match at Karachi Dexter made 205, his highest Test score. That 1961-62 series was a peculiar one: the first Test was played in October 1961, and the second in January 1962, after England played five Tests in India. Since then England have made five Test-playing tours of Pakistan: the 1968-69, 1972-73 and 1977-78 series were drawn 0-0, then Pakistan won 1-0 in both 1983-84 and 1987-88.</p> <p><strong>Is it true that a Test match was once left drawn because one team had to leave to catch the boat home? </strong></p> <p>It actually happened twice. The most famous occasion was the \"Timeless Test\" of 1938-39 at Durban, when England, set 696 to win by South Africa, had reached 654-5 on the tenth day when they had to leave to catch the train to Cape Town to meet the boat home. But it had also happened nine years before, in Jamaica. England batted first and made 849 (Andy Sandham 325, the first Test triple-century). West Indies then made 286, but England, 563 ahead, didn't enforce the follow-on: instead they batted again and made 272-9. The declaration left West Indies the little matter of 836 to win: by the end of the seventh day they had reached 408-5 (George Headley 223). Rain washed out the next two days, at which point England had to go home - so another \"Timeless Test\" was left drawn.</p> <p><strong>Can you please explain the many variations in the legspinner's armoury? </strong></p> <p>You have come to the right place, because I'm a legspinner, although not quite in the Shane Warne class (who is?). The flipper is a difficult-to-bowl delivery which is squeezed out under the wrist, with an action rather like that used to click the fingers. When it's bowled properly, the ball hurries on to the batsman, who can be beaten by the unexpected pace. Shane Warne has often dismissed Daryll Cullinan with this ball. Warne claims to have invented the \"zooter\", so we asked Mark Ray, the Australian journalist who helped write Warne's autobiography, how you bowl it. He said: \"It's difficult to explain without drawings ... but basically the zooter comes out of the front of the hand, with the fingers running across it sideways, like a legbreak - but the ball is propelled more by the palm. It's not unlike a knuckle ball, but not as slow. The zooter does very little in the air or off the pitch - which is part of the point. It's not flatter like the flipper, which is under-spun - the zooter sort of wobbles down.\" So now we know! </p> <p><strong>Has a team ever won a Test after following on? </strong></p> <p>It has been done twice - both times by England! The only recent occasion was the famous match at Headingley in 1981, when Ian Botham turned the match on its head with a rollicking 149 not out after England, following on, had been 135 for 7 and still 92 behind Australia. Botham's heroics lifted England to 356, a lead of 129. Bob Willis, with 8 for 43, then bowled Australia out for 111 and England had won by 18 runs. The other time was in 1894-95, when England (325 and 437) came from behind to beat Australia (586 and 166) by ten runs after following on at Sydney. </p> <p><strong>Who scored most Test runs in the 1990s? </strong></p> <p>This was Alec Stewart of England, who made 6407 runs in 93 Tests in the 1990s, just ahead of Mark Waugh (6371 from 99 matches), Mark Taylor (6306 from 93), Mike Atherton (6217 from 91) and Steve Waugh (6213 from 89). In sixth place was Sachin Tendulkar, with 5626 runs from only 69 matches, at a higher average (58.00) than any of the five men above him. </p> <p><strong>How can I get hold of past issues of Wisden Cricket Monthly? </strong></p> <p>Details of available back issues are given each month in WCM: you'll find it on page 37 of the current (September) issue. The usual price (in the UK) is \u00a32.90, but several cost only \u00a31. You should send a cheque, payable to Wisden Cricket Magazines Ltd, to Wisden, 25 Down Road, Merrow, Guildford, Surrey GU1 2PY. Back issues should soon be available on wisden.com - watch this space. </p> <p><strong>Who has hit the most sixes in an over in a first-class match? </strong></p> <p>Two people have hit the maximum six sixes in an over: Garry Sobers, while playing for Nottinghamshire against Glamorgan at Swansea in 1968 (the bowler was Malcolm Nash), and the Indian Test allrounder Ravi Shastri, who struck Tilak Raj for six sixes for Bombay v Baroda at Bombay in 1984-85. In contrived circumstances at Christchurch in 1989-90 the future New Zealand captain Lee Germon actually hit eight sixes in one over from Wellington's Bert Vance, but he was bowling deliberate no-balls (the over lasted for 22 deliveries) to encourage the batsmen to attack a target. It was a farcical situation: the scoreboard attendants couldn't keep up, while the umpires lost track of the number of legitimate balls bowled, and called \"over\" after only five non-no-balls. The match eventually finished as a draw with the scores level. </p> <p><strong>Where can you find cricket stats on the net? </strong></p> <p>You can find updated records elsewhere on this site (www.wisden.com). CricInfo (www.cricket.org) has an extensive archive of records and past scorecards. It also has a handy \"Stats Guru\" page where you can work out combinations of statistics for players against particular countries or between certain dates: the Indian site www.khel.com has a similar feature. There are lots of other cricket websites as well: just search for \"cricket\" and see what happens! </p> <p><strong>Where can I find the new 2000 Code of Laws? </strong></p> <p>The new laws were approved by MCC members at a recent meeting, and will come into force on October 1, after the current English season finishes. The new Laws are given in the new edition of the Wisden Almanack, and can also be found on MCC's website (<a href=\"http://www-uk.cricket.org/link_to_database/ABOUT_CRICKET/LAWS/2000_CODE/\">click here</a>). </p> <p><strong>How does the County Championship points system work? </strong></p> <p>The points system has changed a lot over the years - and it has changed again for the current season. The easy part is that the side winning the match gets 12 points, and both sides receive four points in a drawn game (six points each for a tie; no points for losing). The complicated bit is the bonus points, which are only available in the first 130 overs of each side's first innings. You can earn a maximum of five batting bonus points, for passing 200, 250, 300, 350 and 400. And you get bowling points - a maximum of three - for taking three, six and nine wickets. So the maximum number of points a county can score in a game is 20. </p> <p><strong>Is there a layman's guide to the Duckworth-Lewis system on the web? </strong></p> <p>The Duckworth-Lewis method of deciding targets in rain-affected one-day games is not easy to understand, but basically the system works out what resources are left to the batting side - if you have all ten wickets standing, that's 100% of your wicket resources, and if you have used up 20 of your 50 overs when it rains, that's 60% of your overs left. You put the two together, find out the overall resources available and compare that to the other team's total. You can find an explanation of the system, written by Messrs (or Professors) Duckworth and Lewis themselves, on CricInfo (<a href=\"   http://www-uk.cricket.org/link_to_database/ABOUT_CRICKET/RAIN_RULES/DUCKWORTH_LEWIS_1999.html\">click here</a>).</p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

      "bodyText": "To celebrate a year of Ask Steven, this week we've collected together some FAQs - Frequently Asked Questions. Have next year's Test dates in England been announced yet? Yes, they have. England start with two Tests against Pakistan, at Lord's (May 17-21) and Old Trafford (May 31-June 4). The three-way NatWest one-day competition, also involving Australia, starts on June 7, with the final at Lord's on June 23. Then England try to regain the Ashes from Australia, who have held them since 1989. The five Tests are at Edgbaston (July 5-9), Lord's (July 19-23), Trent Bridge (August 2-6), Headingley (August 16-20), and The Oval (August 23-27). Those last two Tests start on successive Thursdays, in an attempt to cram three matches into the prime holiday month of August. It will be the first time England have played back-to-back Tests at home since 1912. I am trying to complete my collection of Wisden Almanacks.

What are England's international dates this winter? After the \"Mini World Cup\" in Kenya, England are making their first tour of Pakistan since 1987-88. They will be making a nervous return to the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad, scene of the ugly incident between Mike Gatting and umpire Shakoor Rana which disfigured that last tour.

      "bodyText": "The A320 was the state of the art in airliner design when it entered service in April 1988 as the world's first fully computerised civil aircraft. The 150-seat short- to medium-haul aircraft was the first commercial airliner to employ fly-by-wire technology using a computer to optimise the plane's performance. The computer control prevents the plane from going too fast or making dangerous manoeuvres as well as ensuring efficient use of fuel. The A320, with a range of 3,000 nautical miles, boasts 840 planes in service with 82 operators worldwide. By the end of March 2000, the fleet had accumulated over 10.5m flight hours in over 6.1m departures. It is the fastest-selling commercial aircraft in the world alongside the Boeing 737. David Learmount, operations and safety editor of Flight International magazine said: \"There were three fatal accidents in the first three years of the A320's life which had more to do with crews getting used to the new control systems than anything else.\" In one accident, 87 people were killed near Strasbourg, in eastern France, when the aircraft flew into a mountain. Mr Learmount said: \"It was not because the control system went wrong, but because the pilots were not used to it.\" Previous accidents 1988 An A320 crashed at the Mulhouse-Habsheim air show in eastern France, killing four people. 1990 Ninety-two people died when an Indian airlines A320 crashed near Bangalore airport in February 1990. 1992 87 killed when A320 crashed in Strasbourg 1995 The pilot of an Excalibur Airways A320 jet carrying 185 holidaymakers and seven crew could not turn left because British Airways engineers failed to reconnect controls after maintenance. The plane made a high-speed crash landing at Gatwick. 1998 Three killed when A320 crashed on landing in the Philippines. 1998 A Monarch Airlines A320 made two emergency landings at Luton airport on its way to Verona, Italy, from Manchester.

      "body": "<p>The bitter feud between rival loyalist factions in Belfast is threatening to escalate further after another man was shot dead last night.</p> <p>The shooting came 27 hours after the re-arrest of Ulster Freedom Fighter boss Johnny Adair, who vowed to fight the decision to send him back to jail.</p> <p>The victim, 21-year-old Sam Rocket, was gunned down last night just a few hundred yards from the scene of a double murder by the UVF on Monday.</p> <p>Bobby Mahood, a close associate of Adair, and fellow militant Jackie Coulter, were shot in Belfast's Crumin Road. Mr Mahood will be buried today.</p> <p>Mr Rocket was was shot as he sat in the living room of his girlfriend's home in Summer Street, off Cliftonpark Avenue on the north of the city, and died in hospital a short time later. His young daughter was also believed to have been in the room at the time of the attack. His family were reportedly expelled from the Ulster Defence Association - aligned to the UFF - in the mid-1990s and had switched allegiance to the rival Ulster Volunteer Force. The finger is already being pointed at the UFF, who blamed the UVF for the murders of Mr Mahood and Mr Coulter.</p> <p>Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson condemned last night's murder as a \"cowardly act bringing the loyalist feud to new depths\".</p> <p>Mr Mandelson yesterday stood by his decision to send \"Mad Dog\" Adair back to prison.</p> <p>The UFF leader is planning legal action to overturn the decision and met his legal team at Co Antrim's Maghaberry prison to make preparations for a possible high court judicial review.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson promised to fight any court action. He said: \"I will maintain my decision in whatever forum I have to. I am entirely confident I was right.</p> <p>\"There is always a risk that maverick individuals will want to pursue this blood feud and we must be on our guard. But over time I believe the removal of Mr Adair will cause tension to subside.</p> <p>\"The Shankill community leaders I have been speaking to have said things are calm on the ground. There is no sense of any backlash.\"</p> <p>He insisted recent violence did not mean the loyalist ceasefires had been broken, because he argued, an individual's wrongdoing was not necessarily directed by an organisation.</p> <p>\"By no means do all the UDA or UFF support or subscribe to the actions of Johnny Adair,\" he said.</p> <p>Police yesterday questioned a man in connection with the double murder but released him without charge.</p> <p>John White, of the Ulster Democratic Party, the UFF's political wing, said: \"I have been trying to encourage people to start talking again. I have been told in no uncertain terms there will be no talking. The UFF want to extract their retribution.\"</p> <p>Progressive Unionist Billy Hutchinson, whose party represents the rival Ulster Volunteer Force, said: \"I think both organisations need to take a step back and look at where they are going but I would be concerned there will be more attacks.</p> <p>\"I understand that people will want revenge but there will have to be mediation eventually between the two organisations.</p> <p>The sentence review commission will now examine Mr Mandelson's decision, taking written submissions from both the secretary of state and Adair's legal team. It will give a preliminary finding which either side can challenge at an oral hearing, which could lead to a high court judicial review if it is contested. If Adair loses, his earliest release date will be May 2002.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The bitter feud between rival loyalist factions in Belfast is threatening to escalate further after another man was shot dead last night. The shooting came 27 hours after the re-arrest of Ulster Freedom Fighter boss Johnny Adair, who vowed to fight the decision to send him back to jail. The victim, 21-year-old Sam Rocket, was gunned down last night just a few hundred yards from the scene of a double murder by the UVF on Monday. Bobby Mahood, a close associate of Adair, and fellow militant Jackie Coulter, were shot in Belfast's Crumin Road. Mr Mahood will be buried today. Mr Rocket was was shot as he sat in the living room of his girlfriend's home in Summer Street, off Cliftonpark Avenue on the north of the city, and died in hospital a short time later. His young daughter was also believed to have been in the room at the time of the attack. His family were reportedly expelled from the Ulster Defence Association - aligned to the UFF - in the mid-1990s and had switched allegiance to the rival Ulster Volunteer Force. The finger is already being pointed at the UFF, who blamed the UVF for the murders of Mr Mahood and Mr Coulter. Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson condemned last night's murder as a \"cowardly act bringing the loyalist feud to new depths\". Mr Mandelson yesterday stood by his decision to send \"Mad Dog\" Adair back to prison. The UFF leader is planning legal action to overturn the decision and met his legal team at Co Antrim's Maghaberry prison to make preparations for a possible high court judicial review. Mr Mandelson promised to fight any court action. He said: \"I will maintain my decision in whatever forum I have to. I am entirely confident I was right. \"There is always a risk that maverick individuals will want to pursue this blood feud and we must be on our guard. But over time I believe the removal of Mr Adair will cause tension to subside. \"The Shankill community leaders I have been speaking to have said things are calm on the ground. There is no sense of any backlash.\" He insisted recent violence did not mean the loyalist ceasefires had been broken, because he argued, an individual's wrongdoing was not necessarily directed by an organisation. \"By no means do all the UDA or UFF support or subscribe to the actions of Johnny Adair,\" he said. Police yesterday questioned a man in connection with the double murder but released him without charge. John White, of the Ulster Democratic Party, the UFF's political wing, said: \"I have been trying to encourage people to start talking again. I have been told in no uncertain terms there will be no talking. The UFF want to extract their retribution.\" Progressive Unionist Billy Hutchinson, whose party represents the rival Ulster Volunteer Force, said: \"I think both organisations need to take a step back and look at where they are going but I would be concerned there will be more attacks. \"I understand that people will want revenge but there will have to be mediation eventually between the two organisations. The sentence review commission will now examine Mr Mandelson's decision, taking written submissions from both the secretary of state and Adair's legal team. It will give a preliminary finding which either side can challenge at an oral hearing, which could lead to a high court judicial review if it is contested. If Adair loses, his earliest release date will be May 2002.",

      "bodyText": "Hell Atlantic they called it, before America's largest telecommunications company changed its name. But the name change from Bell Atlantic to Verizon in June has done little to end the local telephone company's customer service problems. This week, the company more or less settled a damaging 15-day fight with its largest unions. During this time, 90,000 repair requests piled up and at least one customer did the company a favour and voluntarily removed herself from its 200,000 backlog waiting for services or new lines to be installed. After more than four months of waiting for an ironically named high-speed network, I gave up. Few foreigners arriving in America can believe how awful the telephone services are in some of the most developed cities in the world. We are not talking about mobile phones, which everybody knows work better in a Mongolian yurt than on Madison Avenue. Just basic telephone services. One friend working in Washington this summer had to wait weeks to be allowed to make international calls from home. Another in Brooklyn had to wait in for six consecutive days until they returned her dial tone. My own problems started in April when I knew I had to do something about running a phone, fax and computer from one line at home. Opting for for a digital subscriber line, or DSL, which is meant to offer a speedier web connection over an ordinary telephone line, I half hoped that choosing Mindspring, the internet service provider, to deliver the service would make a difference. But I failed to realise that because Bell Atlantic, like all the former US telephone monopolies, operates the copper wires into homes and offices, it insists on sending its own engineers to make sure they work. The initial email from Mindspring warned that the installation of a DSL line needed two engineering appointments. The first would involve a Bell Atlantic technician working on something called a network interface device. This appointment would be an \"all-day\" one, meaning that somebody had to wait in from 8am to 6pm, just in case. I worked at home all day and saw nobody.

There are complaints about its high-speed internet access service but at least I was given a weekend appointment with a wait time of just four hours. Verizon, as it is now called, has admitted to some problems with its DSL services. It has blamed the east coast's ageing infrastructure and dense population for some of them. Earlier this month, it teamed up with a dedicated high-speed company called Northpoint communications to improve its DSL service. A company spokesman said this week that most customers of this service had to wait just 15 working days from order to installation. The strike had doubled this \"average\" waiting time for new customers this week. He said waiting more than four months without being much closer to delivery was unusual. Companies such as Mindspring, which have had some success with their DSL services, have complained about the local telephone companies.

The UDA had vowed to retaliate by killing UVF supporters in the area.</p> <p>Despite the rising violence, Northern Ireland minister Peter Mandelson, insisted that a joint UDA-UVF cease-fire remained intact. Speaking before the latest shooting, Mandelson said he had no doubt that most commanders of the UDA and UVF did not want their feud to degenerate into a total breakdown of their 1994 truce, a pillar of Northern Ireland's shaky peace accord.</p> <p>\"It is possible for an organization to be on cease-fire but for individuals associated with it to be involved in unlawful activity,\" he said.</p> <p>Mandelson also defended his decision on Tuesday to order the immediate arrest and reimprisonment of the most notorious militant, Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair, who was seized at police gunpoint and delivered by helicopter back to prison. The brawny UDA commander was paroled early from prison last year under terms of the 1998 peace accord, but he had been accused of stoking up an increasingly violent turf war with UVF members, particularly in his Shankill Road power base.</p> <p>Adair led a raucous UDA parade up the Shankill Road last weekend, inspiring gun attacks on a UVF-linked pub and several leading UVF members' homes. The UVF retaliated on Monday by fatally shooting two men, one of them an Adair subordinate, as they sat in a parked car on the nearby Crumlin Road.</p> <p>Britain deployed police and troops into the Shankill district to deter an expected UDA counterstrike. Last night's shooting on a residential street just off the Crumlin Road happened not far from a joint police-army checkpoint. No arrests were reported in response.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a Protestant man being questioned about involvement in Monday's lethal shootings was freed late Wednesday without charge. Detectives continued to question five others arrested on Monday during police raids on houses that contained eight guns and ammunition. Two were scheduled to appear in court today to face charges of illegal arms possession.</p> <p>Had Mandelson ruled that the joint UDA-UVF truce had broken down, he could have ordered more than 150 convicted members of both groups to be returned to prison to continue serving their suspended sentences. Instead, he focused criticism on Adair, calling him the leading member of a small group of \"gangsters and thugs who operate on the black side of Northern Ireland society.\"</p> <p>He said Adair had been \"given a chance to go straight,\" but had instead \"whipped up the feud.\" The viability of the Good Friday peace accord depends in part on the maintainance of cease-fires by the Irish Republican Army, which draws support from the most militant Catholic areas, and Protestant-based gangs such as the UDA and UVF. Before calling their joint cease-fire, those two Protestant groups were responsible for slaying more than 800 Catholic civilians.</p> <p>The cease-fire period has seen rivalry rise between the two groups, particularly once Adair returned home to the Shankill last year. Adair, 36, was convicted in 1994 of \"directing terrorism,\" a previously unheard-of charge, after being taped by undercover police officers bragging about his pivotal role in terrorizing Belfast Catholics. He served just five years of his 16-year sentence.</p> <p>Adair's close friend in the UDA-linked Ulster Democratic Party, John White, said Wednesday that lawyers had been hired to challenge Mandelson's reimprisonment order on grounds of lack of evidence.</p> <p>Adair's wife, Gina, insisted her husband was being unfairly singled out. \"There's loads of people out there inciting violence. Why just John?\" she said. \"Because of who he is.\"</p> <p>But Mandelson said he didn't expect Adair to get back out any time soon.

This motion was regarded as a little strong for some of those present, in particular the Egyptians. They pointed to the danger of the plan misfiring \"as the English would then have the moral support of the whole world in refusing to evacuate Egypt\". The proposal was finally rejected by a majority, according to the report, based on information from what the special branch described as \"Indian sources\". Instead there was \"general approval\" that \"sentence of death\" be passed on Lloyd George who \"represented unhappiness for the whole of the Orient\". Similar sentences were passed on two others, including one Colonel Maxwell. \"Have you any idea who Colonel Maxwell can be?\" asked Colonel Carter, a senior special branch officer, to his colleague, Inspector Randall. The documents released yesterday shed no further light on the matter. However, Carter advised Randall, the prime minister's protection officer: \"I think you ought to be most careful to keep an eye open for the Turks or lower-class Greeks who may be wandering about and endeavouring to get too near to Mr Lloyd George\". That was not the only plan to assassinate Lloyd George. An earlier report of a plot to kill the prime minister was sent to special branch by Sir Mansfield Cumming, a monocled retired naval officer who was the first head of MI6. The letter is signed in green ink, then as now the practice of the Chief, as he is officially called, of MI6.",

Only Hall has ever been shortlisted before.</p> <p>But Perrier director Nica Burns insisted there had been no behind the scenes rows.</p> <p>\"There was no plot against Scott Capurro, the judges simply found five shows that were funnier. There was quite a long discussion about Scott before the final five were decided, but the judges' feelings were clear.\"</p> <p>She said that for her Garth Marenghi's Fright Knight had been the real find of the festival. \"They are what the Perrier is all about, finding fresh, exciting talent.</p> <p>\"No one had heard of them when they came to Edinburgh. They had no organisation behind them and now they are in there with a chance of the Perrier.\"</p> <p>They leave, however, having been snapped up by Avalon, the management company who now dominate the comedy scene.</p> <p>Capurro, a previous Perrier best newcomer, was doing his yoga yesterday when the news came through and did not want to ruin his karma by carping. \"I think they are all great choices. Maybe they wanted someone who would be good to promote the product [Perrier], and I guess I wouldn't be their first choice for that,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Primarily, I think they are looking for someone who will translate to TV, so you get these surprises. Something similar happened a few years ago with Johnny Vegas when everyone thought he would win but he didn't.\"</p> <p>Capurro said that for him the biggest shock was that the highly rated Belfast stand-up Colin Murphy did not make the final five.</p> <p>Nor was there a nomination for the cult football comic, Bob Doolally, who has been persuading hundreds of native Edinburghians to break the habit of a lifetime and actually go to something on the Fringe.</p> <p>With a few exceptions, such as Ben Keaton and Brown Blues who won in the late 1980s, a Perrier award is a guarantee of much wider fame and all the riches that go with a TV deal.</p> <p>In Lee Evans's case, it brought him to Hollywood.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Perrier award rediscovered its touch for controversy last night by snubbing the comedian who has garnered the best reviews and the most headlines at the Edinburgh Festival. Scott Capurro, whose insistence that even the Holocaust can be joked about has sparked a series of walkouts from his shows, was pointedly left off the shortlist of five for the \u00a35,000 prize, traditional ticket to the big time for struggling stand-ups. The gay American comic leads a procession of holy cows to the slaughter every night in his show at the Pleasance theatre, and his taste for confrontation and for challenging the orthodoxies has on occasion left more sensitive audience members in tears. With nothing to match the unholy row kicked up last year by the exclusion of Al Murray, and his eventual triumph after a u-turn by the Perrier committee, many critics have been complaining about how bland, safe and TV oriented most of the acts on the Fringe this year are. A contest between Dave Gorman, Capurro, and Rich Hall's country and western singing ex-con creation, Otis Crenshaw, had been widely predicted. In the event, Capurro was left out in favour of the talented surrealist Sean Locke, Lee Mack's sketch show, and Garth Marenghi's Fright Knight, a Stephen King spoof. Only Hall has ever been shortlisted before. But Perrier director Nica Burns insisted there had been no behind the scenes rows. \"There was no plot against Scott Capurro, the judges simply found five shows that were funnier. There was quite a long discussion about Scott before the final five were decided, but the judges' feelings were clear.\" She said that for her Garth Marenghi's Fright Knight had been the real find of the festival. \"They are what the Perrier is all about, finding fresh, exciting talent. \"No one had heard of them when they came to Edinburgh. They had no organisation behind them and now they are in there with a chance of the Perrier.\" They leave, however, having been snapped up by Avalon, the management company who now dominate the comedy scene. Capurro, a previous Perrier best newcomer, was doing his yoga yesterday when the news came through and did not want to ruin his karma by carping. \"I think they are all great choices. Maybe they wanted someone who would be good to promote the product [Perrier], and I guess I wouldn't be their first choice for that,\" he said. \"Primarily, I think they are looking for someone who will translate to TV, so you get these surprises. Something similar happened a few years ago with Johnny Vegas when everyone thought he would win but he didn't.\" Capurro said that for him the biggest shock was that the highly rated Belfast stand-up Colin Murphy did not make the final five. Nor was there a nomination for the cult football comic, Bob Doolally, who has been persuading hundreds of native Edinburghians to break the habit of a lifetime and actually go to something on the Fringe. With a few exceptions, such as Ben Keaton and Brown Blues who won in the late 1980s, a Perrier award is a guarantee of much wider fame and all the riches that go with a TV deal. In Lee Evans's case, it brought him to Hollywood.",

      "bodyText": "The number of Scottish school leavers being accepted for places in universities has dropped by 6.6% as the exam results delay continues. Officials at Ucas, the university admissions service, expressed concern at the figures, which contradict assurances by Scottish ministers that pupils will not lose out in the race for a place. The Ucas chief executive, Tony Higgins, said universities were trying to be flexible with students disadvantaged by the results debacle, and they hoped the numbers accepted would rise in the coming weeks. Scotland's first minister, Donald Dewar, told parents and students that everything possible was being done to address the situation, which has left thousands of students with incomplete or incorrect certificates. He said the ultimate responsibility for the crisis lay with him, and he again gave his backing to the education minister, Sam Galbraith. The Scottish qualifications authority, which is responsible for the marking and distribution of results, has blamed data management problems and claimed that only 5% of students are affected. But concerns about the standards of marking are growing, with schools across Scotland reporting unusually poor results and markers themselves questioning the validity of the system. David Cooney, a teacher and exam marker with 24 years experience, said inexperienced markers had been drafted in at the last minute, the number of papers to be marked had increased and the time in which to mark them had been reduced. \"There were a lot of irregularities this year,\" he said. At St Columba's school in Kilmacolm, Inverclyde, the rector, Andrew Livingstone, said teachers had been stunned by the grades awarded. The school had expected 95 grade A passes among fifth year pupils, but the final figure was 60. \"We are an accurate school,\" he said. \"The drop is so marked that there must be some reason for this to have occurred.\" Mr Galbraith has continued to insist that he will not resign over the issue, despite repeated calls by opposition parties for him to stand down. The qualifications authority has said that more than 5,000 students received incomplete or erroneous certificates, and 2,000 of them are still waiting to learn their true grades, two weeks after they should have been issued. Officials said their cases would be dealt with in a matter of days but they have been unable to say exactly when.",

Health professionals said the attack at St George's hospital in Tooting, south London, highlighted the dangers hospital staff and GPs face each day and said it was time the NHS \"learned the lessons\" prompted by a proliferation of assaults. While there are no figures for the number of attacks against hospital doctors, 40% of GPs and half of all nurses have been assaulted while at work, according to surveys by the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing. The attack happened on August 8 at around 2am as Paul Trotman, a 28-year-old auxiliary nurse, returned from a break. As he made his way down a corridor, a woman screamed for help and he rushed to her aid. Her accomplice then hit him over the head and stabbed him five times before snatching his credit cards. Mr Trotman managed to call for help before being taken to the accident and emergency department, where he was treated and sent home. Police are hunting for the woman and her accomplice.

It shows that the most powerful motor of population growth in the southern counties is the flight of relatively prosperous families from suburban London. People moving out of the capital were responsible for 50% of the population growth elsewhere in the south between 1991 and 1998, whereas migration from the north, midlands, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales accounted for only 8%, the researchers said. Other factors explaining a 623,000 increase in the southern population outside London over the period were a higher than expected birth rate and immigration. The report said an extra 4.3m households would need accommodation in the UK by 2021. The demand for homes would fall disproportionately on the south-east, where the population was expected to grow by 50,000 a year, putting pressure on greenfield sites. But a continuing middle class exodus from London would not reduce its population, because it had a high birth rate and it was the main destination for migration from within and beyond the EU. London's migrant population was expected to increase by 31,000 a year for the foreseeable future and would include extremes of rich and poor.

He reported that Sir William Penney, deputy chairman of the Atomic Energy Authority, agreed. Penney said the chances against achieving a successful defence was \"probably a thousand to one or a million to one against\". Another government adviser, Sir Robert Cockburn, chief scientist at the Ministry of Aviation, is reported as saying: \"In the last resort, the offence would have advantage over the defence through the simple processes of surprise and saturation.\" The views echo growing criticism now of US plans to build a multi-billion dollar national missile defence shield. President Clinton is expected soon to make a decision about whether to go ahead with the project which has been dogged with technical problems. Russia, China, and most of Washington's allies are strongly opposed to the plan, which, they say, will be deeply destabilising. In 1962, Zuckerman noted that an anti-ballistic defence system \"if achievable, could undoubtedly be critical in disturbing the strategic balance\". The Zuckerman documents were drawn up at a time when the US was considering resuming nuclear tests, partly to try out such a system and partly to raise the morale of nuclear scientists - \"an issue\", Zuckerman noted, \"which obviously could not be raised in public\". Documents released yesterday also reveal how another prominent government adviser questioned the purpose of Britain's nuclear deterrent. \"The United Kingdom can be effectively eliminated as a viable country by a mere 10 [Russian] nuclear bombs\", warned Lord Victor Rothschild. Ten bombs dropped on 10 large towns would kill 13.6 m people, up to 70% of their combined population, he said. Since it could not distinguish between a US or a British nuclear missile, he added, Russia might respond to a US attack by attacking Britain. \"Whatever the US may say or believe about the acceptability of megadeaths in the US\", he said, \"the effective elimination of the UK by a small number of H-bombs must raise very serious doubts about the desirability of our having Polaris missiles at all.\" Rothschild, then chairman of research for the Shell oil company, and with strong links to the Whitehall establishment, made his comments in a minority report in 1968 on the future of the atomic weapons research establishment at Aldermaston, Berkshire.

      "bodyText": "Muslim rebels fighting to create a hardline Islamic state in central Asia were yesterday closing in on the Uzbek capital, Tashkent, after battling their way across three countries. Up to 200 gunmen, who crossed into the country at the weekend, fought their way to within 60 miles of the capital, killing several Uzbek soldiers. Last night they were hiding in Bostanlyk, a holiday resort north-east of Tashkent. Health spas in the town have been emptied of holidaymakers and the roads to the capital are under heavy guard. Government artillery and troops were being moved into the resort. \"The area has been surrounded, but we have so far failed to locate the gunmen,\" an Uzbek government source said yesterday. The rebels are believed to be members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which opposes the secular government of the Uzbek president, Islam Karimov, and wants to create an Islamic state in the rugged mountains of Central Asia. They are thought to have crossed from their bases in Tajikistan through mountain passes into Kyrgyzstan, where they fought fierce battles with government troops in the past fortnight, leaving at least 18 soldiers and 40 rebels dead. Last week the Kyrgyz president, Askar Akayev, said 50 gunmen were engaged in heavy fighting with government troops after entering the country from Tajikistan, where he said more fighters were massing. \"Another group of over 150 is right by the border,\" he said. \"We know that around 800 well-armed bandits are operating from the Tajik border region.\" Leaders of the central Asian states accuse Afghanistan's fundamentalist Islamic Taliban regime of training the men, who include well-armed snipers, among them Arabs, Pakistanis, Chechens, Russians, Ukrainians, Kyrgyz, Uzbeks and Tajiks. The Taliban, who have imposed a brutally strict interpretation of Islamic law across most of Afghanistan, says they only give the rebels moral support. Russia keeps several thousand troops in a border security force along the Tajik-Afghan border to counter what it sees as a threat from terrorism and religious extremism, spreading north into the former Soviet states of central Asia. Russian border guards killed six gunmen who were trying to cross from Afghanistan late on Tuesday. Many of those crossing are smuggling drugs. Last week, Russian guards shot dead 10 smugglers on the border and recovered 118kgs of heroin.",

While flags were flown at half-mast on all government buildings, special services of commemoration held in churches throughout the country, and light entertainment cancelled, Mr Putin returned to Moscow from the Arctic circle abruptly early yesterday, calling off plans to go out to the site of the disaster in the Barents Sea to cast funeral wreaths on to the water. The sudden cancellation of the ceremony followed several hours of tense, deeply emotional, and at times hostile discussions between the president and the grieving families at the Kursk's base of Vidyayevo outside Murmansk. The abandoning of the Barents Sea ritual was unique for Russia. It marked the first time that analysts could recall a Kremlin chief cancelling an official ceremony under public pressure, highlighting the scale of the popular outrage gripping Russia at the loss of the seamen and also the increasing role public opinion is playing in Russian politics. Hundreds of relatives crowded into the Vidyayevo naval officers' hall for Mr Putin's belated first appearance in the far north 10 days after the submarine sank in still unexplained circumstances. He listened intently to the bitter complaints of the navy widows. For the first time in a crisis that has dealt a severe blow to his authority the president emerged with his reputation relatively intact, according to some of those present. But despite the widespread public disgust with the navy commanders, a senior admiral yesterday sounded unrepentant at the conduct of his peers throughout the Kursk tragedy. Admiral Vladimir Yegorov, the chief of Russia's Baltic fleet, insisted there had been no failure to supply information, that the navy was in sound financial shape, and that its rescue personnel and equipment were second to none. By contrast, the defence minister, Igor Sergeyev, the navy chief, Vladimir Kuroyedov, and the commander of the Northern Fleet, Vyacheslav Popov, have all offered to resign, but Mr Putin refused to accept their resignations. Mr Putin was supposed to lead the national mourning yesterday by going out to sea with the relatives to cast flowers at the scene of the tragedy, but many of the wives refuse to accept that their husbands are dead and feared that such a ceremony at sea would absolve the government of responsibility to bring out the corpses. \"The grief is immeasurable, there are not enough words of comfort. My heart hurts, but yours hurt even more,\" Mr Putin told the families. They were promised compensation payments amounting to 10 years' salary. On one of the rare occasions when the authorities have been frank and direct with the families, Mr Putin told them it would take months to raise the stricken submarine and bring out the bodies, even if it was possible. In a letter leaked to the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda and which they gave the president's entourage, more than 20 widows and mothers called for the defence minister and the three top navy officers to be put on trial. In a further sign of their mistrust of officialdom the widows demanded that the search for the bodies in the sunken vessel be carried out in the presence of independent witnesses. Mr Putin's trip to Vidyayevo marked his first serious attempt to claw back some moral high ground after his catastrophic decision to stay on holiday at the other end of Russia for the first week of the drama. The scale of his miscalculation emerged clearly from a poll published yesterday in the largest circulation paper, Trud. It found that 28% of those surveyed thought worse of him now than before the tragedy. Based on a sample of 500 Muscovites, it also found that 22.5% blamed him for the sailors' deaths. Another 35% put the blame on the naval high command. The All-Russian Public Opinion Centre, which polled 1,574 people across Russia in its regular monthly survey, announced yesterday that confidence in the president had fallen by 8%. Emerging from a special memorial mass in Moscow's cathedral of Christ the Saviour, Yevgeni Levlampiyev, a 20-year-old history student, said he had not voted for Mr Putin because he had no confidence in the president's commitment to free speech and democracy. \"But he got to power by exploiting the very strong nostalgia people have for the past, their national sense of humiliation, and the Chechen issue.

      "bodyText": "Britain's trading gap with countries outside the European Union widened last month to its highest recorded level, official figures showed yesterday. Imports from non-EU countries outstripped British exports by \u00a32.8bn in July, according to the Office for National Statistics. The non-EU deficit over the last quarter stands at \u00a36.2bn, also a record. While the trade gap with countries outside the European Union is deteriorating, ONS data for European trade suggests that performance with EU countries has been surprisingly robust, given the ongoing strength of sterling against the euro. The trade gap with EU countries for June stood at \u00a3131m, its narrowest since March 1997. Analysts said robust growth in the euro area is helping to close the deficit with the EU, while the slowdown in the US appeared to be the force behind the widening trade gap with the rest of the world. On a volume basis, which strips out price changes, non-EU exports fell by a massive 5.7% in July, as imports continued to rise. With the EU, the position was reversed, with exports rising 5% in June, while imports fell by 1%. \"The main feature of the latest data is the surge in EU export volumes,\" said Neil Parker, UK economist of Royal Bank of Scotland. However, he warned that exporters were improving their performance to the EU by cutting prices. Other analysts said that surveys of business order books suggested the position is likely to deteriorate. \"Although the figures show little sign that the strong pound is providing a drag on export growth, weakening export orders suggest that this might not last,\" said Jonathan Loynes, UK economist with Capital Economics. The better than expected performance on trade to the EU helped stabilise the whole world goods deficit in June at \u00a32.3bn, the same as the previous month. However, the more up to date figures for non-EU countries point to there being a record whole world deficit when the July figures are published next month. Separate ONS data showed that the economy grew by 0.9% in the second quarter of the year, the same figure published in their initial estimate. More detailed expenditure information, available for the first time showed a pickup in household spending, from 0.6% in the first quarter, to 0.8% in the second, a figure which could alarm members of the Bank of England's key rate setting committee. \"[This is] not particularly good news for interest rates,\" said Adam Chester, economist at the Halifax bank. But other analysts said it merely reflected a bounceback after the first quarter's millennium induced slump. \"Domestic demand in the first half was dramatically slower than in the second half of last year,\" said Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics. \"The 0.8% increase in household spending was surprisingly weak.\" Much of the overall growth in the second quarter was a result of higher demand for energy supply and extraction. The ONS said bad weather and higher oil prices explained much of the strength in these sectors. Without it, overall growth in the second quarter would have been 0.6%. The GDP deflator - the widest measure of inflation - fell to 1.8%, the lowest for five years, a further encouraging sign for those hoping interest rates have peaked. The household consumption deflator, a measure of the inflation facing households, fell to its lowest level for 37 years.",

Viag Interkom is Germany's third-ranking player with 2m mobile customers and is still upgrading its network for next-generation mobile services. Stephen Pentland, partner at Spectrum Strategy Consultants, said entrenched competitors such as Vodafone's Mobilfunk and Deutsche Telekom's T-Mobile would make it difficult for BT to adopt a premium price position in Germany. \"In terms of cost and value the German customer has never had it better. It's an enormously risky strategy for BT given they are not the main player,\" he said. Mobile operators will be seeking to recoup the cost of their licences through revenues from access, content, e-commerce, advertising and location-based services.",

The Tories are in a mess and nothing that they are doing at the moment is likely to improve things.</p> <p>One reason why this should be has come my way. It is not - alas - another sensational leak. It is not even a particularly impressive document. It is the transcript of part of a Question Time programme on BBC Television and it is the contribution to that programme by Amanda Platell, press secretary to William Hague. It was released by the Labour party to at least one other newspaper some days ago but very little attention was paid to it. I cannot imagine why not - it is extraordinarily revealing, in a number of different ways, about the nature of the political process. And about Ms Platell.</p> <p>First, an explanation which itself says much about the issues involved. Why was the Labour party in possession of this transcript? Perhaps they had asked the BBC for a copy because some bright spark at the party's headquarters in Millbank remembered that Amanda Platell had appeared on the programme and thought it might be worth finding out what she said in the hope of embarrassing the Tories? Wrong. The Labour party had this material because when Ms Platell was a guest on Question Time she was the Managing Editor of the Mirror Group of Newspapers and, in that responsible position, was briefed for the programme by the appropriate department within the Labour party itself. They made a recording and kept the transcript.</p> <p>But why did the briefing occur? Why would someone deemed smart enough to be the managing editor of anything - let alone a mass circulation tabloid newspaper - need to be briefed about what she thought about any area of current affairs? It might perhaps have been understandable if she had asked the public affairs department of MGN to furnish her privately with the up-to-date political position on the coal industry, care in the community or proportional representation before the programme. All of these subjects were among those discussed and were clearly in the news at the time. But it says something very bizarre about public affairs and the way current news issues are handled on television that it should be necessary for such a briefing to be offered by the Labour party and, even more, that it should be accepted by a high-profile public figure.</p> <p>It is known and understood by journalists that in the hermetic conditions of today's clinically controlled politics, most MPs are briefed to the eyeballs. Their bleepers tell them what to think and say about everything. Should they be invited to express their views in public and if, of course, their appearance is approved by their minders at HQ, they will secure a run-down from their own parties on the correct line to take on every subject before daring to tiptoe before a microphone. Anything to avoid the shame and horror of having to risk expressing any kind of individuality or personal political commitment.</p> <p>Yet it is rather odd to discover that this also extends to executives of the once great Mirror. The obvious implication is that Amanda Platell was expected to express views consistent with those supported by the Labour party, which was then in opposition. There is no date on the transcript but it seems evident from the context that the programme was broadcast some time in early 1993. But whenever it was, it will have been a relief to those involved on the party's side that Ms Platell performed her role to perfection.</p> <p>She spoke with sympathy about the problems of striking miners, forced to work extra hours for less pay by a (Conservative) government seeking to sell off their industry. She spoke powerfully about the Mirror's support for the leftwing. \"As long as we have breath,\" she said of her newspaper, \"it will continue to support the Labour party.\" She spoke of \"fighting against social injustice\", for the views of \"our readers\" who were Labour supporters. Later she boasted of the newspaper's coverage attacking the closure by the (Conservative) government of Westminster Hospital and how they had exposed the \"outrageous\" expenditure by Peter Lilley, the then (Conservative) secretary of state for social security on his travel to and from his home in France.</p> <p>She was a bit woolly about PR but said that \"you would not have had the poll tax in a million years if there had been any chance - if we'd had proportional representation.\" And she spoke about being \"terribly terribly worried\" walking down any street in this country and seeing \"people in doorways who obviously should be in hospitals, who should be in institutions and who've been kicked out by this (Conservative) government because they didn't have the funds to keep them in the hospitals.\"</p> <p>Now I have no idea whether Amanda Platell believed what she was saying when she said it, but I rather suspect that she cannot possibly have done so.

He may have got a free suit from Prada for the American premiere of Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, but he was small fry nonetheless. And he knew it. Like All Bran, humbling experiences may not taste great but they are good for you. </p> <p>With a supporting \"cast\" including Anjelica Huston, Adrian Lester and Billy Bob Thornton all giving insiders' critiques of the business we call show, Starstruck once again probed the inner workings of celebrity like a master surgeon. While all had interesting points to make - Rufus Sewell's anger at his cooperation with his own humiliation at auditions was particularly memorable - it was to Sienna Guilroy that Starstruck belonged.

With all that space and nice coloured cushions, you could cartwheel from the dining table to the front windows at least three times without fear of smashing any ornaments. </p> <p>Unlike Lowri Turner's, which - if it is her house from which she presents <strong> The Lipstick Years</strong> (BBC2) - is jam-packed full of hideous ornaments culled from a jumble sale at Lady Tavistock's country pile. </p> <p>This week, concentrating on housewives, there were moments of The Lipstick Years which were surely cues for country and western songs. There was Shirley Conran's \"No One's Going To Strangle You If The Mantelpiece Is Dusty\", Nigella Lawson's \"I'm No Scrubber But I Bake A Mean Biscuit\", and my personal favourite, \"Feed The Baby, Load The Twin-Tub And Pass the Mogadon\".

And, just as Nick Ross saying \"Don't have nightmares. Do sleep well\" has absolutely no periaptic properties but is still oddly comforting, so the Crimewatch music irrationally stirs one's civic conscience. A call to arms, no less. </p> <p>These are the dog days of August however (the dogs having eaten the salad days) and there is no crime, so <strong> Crimewatch UK: Solved</strong> (BBC1) was dedicated to crimes \"you, the public\" helped solve. The happiest endings you could expect from some thoroughly nasty crimes (child abuse, murder, armed robbery and football hooliganism), it was part self-congratulatory and part public relations exercise for the police.

They were Scottish, naturally. </p> <p>Whatever this bunch of officers were investigating, their gravitas was tempered by humour and their determination by concern for their victims.

It is a political film about the war on drugs in America that is bound to court controversy. \"This is a movie that could be the toast of critics and film buffs everywhere. It deals with a tough subject matter, though, and I'm not convinced that the US public have the stomach for a moral debate during their popcorn.\" </p> <p>Hanging on in there with an outside chance is the latest by Australian director Baz Luhrmann. \"The presence of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge guarantees at least half a chance of success. But it's hard to see this one troubling the year's real blockbusters in the rankings. </p> <p>\"As for Dancer In The Dark, while few people dislike the elfin Nordic songstress Bj\u00f6rk, how many people will like her enough to sit through a Lars von Trier musical?

Tom Hanks and Castaway head the list. \"We've been tempted to bet against Tom Hanks before, particularly in our Oscars markets, and it's definitely a case of once bitten twice shy\", warns Sean. \"This looks a complex and demanding movie, but the combination of Hanks and Zemeckis means that it could strike gold.\" With Bruce Willis back on board, young director M Night Shyamalan is after a repeat of the success of The Sixth Sense. \"But the track record of young directors' second films is not great\", says Sean. \"My spies tell me that that young Mr Shyamalan has given free reign to his creativity here, and I fear a self-indulgent flop could be the result.\" Steven Soderbergh has been describing Traffic as \"The French Connection meets Nashville\". It is a political film about the war on drugs in America that is bound to court controversy. \"This is a movie that could be the toast of critics and film buffs everywhere. It deals with a tough subject matter, though, and I'm not convinced that the US public have the stomach for a moral debate during their popcorn.\" Hanging on in there with an outside chance is the latest by Australian director Baz Luhrmann. \"The presence of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge guarantees at least half a chance of success. But it's hard to see this one troubling the year's real blockbusters in the rankings. \"As for Dancer In The Dark, while few people dislike the elfin Nordic songstress Bj\u00f6rk, how many people will like her enough to sit through a Lars von Trier musical? Nuff said.\"",

Cream throw by Ralph Lauren, \u00a3199. Five sets of Arthur Price cutlery, \u00a3152.50 each. (Maybe they don't like washing up.) Tanzanian tablecloth, \u00a3102. And so on.</p> <p>Funnily enough, a list of an entirely different kind grabbed headlines yesterday, too, one that also concerned itself with a romantic destination of a sort. Rod Baber, a 29-year-old telecoms consultant, spoke of a travel itinerary that included such exotic names as Gran Paradiso, Monte Titano, Olympus. On closer inspection, these were found to be not chic five-star hotels but names on a 47-strong list of Europe's highest peaks. And for those of you for whom these things matter, he cut four years off the previous tour record. Yes, astoundingly, someone had tried it before.</p> <p>Now, let's be agreed on this: mountains are great things, sexy and life-affirming and compelling, in a way that perhaps Anthea Turner is not. But the notion that someone would one day wake up and make a list of every top peak in every European country, then climb each and every last one of them until the list was ticked off, smacks of dull-minded obsession.</p> <p>The motivation for going somewhere just because it is featured on a list is hard to comprehend. While women's lists are about desire and acquisitiveness, men's tend to be about being master of all they survey. The fact is, men don't make the same lists as women, as anyone who has read or seen Nick Hornby's High Fidelity will know. Theirs are sturdy, lovingly fact-checked mini versions of the Guinness Book of Hit Singles.</p> <p>\"I'm sorry but, at the risk of becoming a Hornby-esque clich\u00e9, I really do lie awake at night trying to remember whether it was The Fall who made the most appearances in the top 10 of John Peel's Festive 50 since 1980,\" confesses one male friend. \"And another thing, I just don't understand why you carry around little lists of things like 'Buy lampshade' and 'Find cake recipe', which you then never do.\"</p> <p>I'm not entirely sure why I do it either because writing a list of things to do, as with new year resolutions, is no guarantee that you're going to take action. There was a time when I used to keep a diary but now I don't bother, I just make lists, which I keep and laugh about at a later date.</p> <p>Frankly this is worrying since the nadir of all female list-making is Bridget Jones' Diary. That book is basically a diary in list form. The compulsive daily bulletins on weight, calorie, alcohol and cigarette intake, as well as the odd time inventory featuring moments wasted in the pursuit of unavailable men, amount to a journey with no destination.</p> <p>Helen Fielding's list-making is curiously male in its obsessive precision and accuracy. The most engaging women's lists are like mini narratives, the sorts of lists you read in the journals of exotic adventurers like Amelia Earhart or Anais Nin. Some women's lists have been transformed into works of art - look at Tracey Emin's patchwork creation Everyone I've Ever Slept With 1963-1995. Video artist Jenny Holzer, who has an installation at Tate Modern, also thrives on lists, in her case alphabetical lists of mocking self-improvement slogans such as Boredom Makes You Do Crazy Things and Protect Me From What I Want.</p> <p>Gender experts would doubtless posit that this difference in approach is rooted in biology. In their excellent book Why Men Don't Iron (And Women Can't Map Read), Anne and Bill Moir explore the reasons why women tend to seek order over their environments and men just want to go out there and stake out their territory. Yes, you've guessed it, they agree that a Darwinian theory is the only one that makes any sense.</p> <p>Men apparently have a biological need to go off and conquer various aspects of nature (and by \"nature\" we can include odd anoraky terrain such as railway platforms), while women are left at home making sad lists about cake mix and plants. This is helpful at least when it comes to understanding why it is that in general men are incapable of making shopping lists; now we know it's because they are biologically programmed to go out and conquer the shelves, filling the trolley with as many useless items as possible, rather than making a list of things that might actually make a meal.</p>",

Theirs are sturdy, lovingly fact-checked mini versions of the Guinness Book of Hit Singles. \"I'm sorry but, at the risk of becoming a Hornby-esque clich\u00e9, I really do lie awake at night trying to remember whether it was The Fall who made the most appearances in the top 10 of John Peel's Festive 50 since 1980,\" confesses one male friend. \"And another thing, I just don't understand why you carry around little lists of things like 'Buy lampshade' and 'Find cake recipe', which you then never do.\" I'm not entirely sure why I do it either because writing a list of things to do, as with new year resolutions, is no guarantee that you're going to take action. There was a time when I used to keep a diary but now I don't bother, I just make lists, which I keep and laugh about at a later date. Frankly this is worrying since the nadir of all female list-making is Bridget Jones' Diary. That book is basically a diary in list form. The compulsive daily bulletins on weight, calorie, alcohol and cigarette intake, as well as the odd time inventory featuring moments wasted in the pursuit of unavailable men, amount to a journey with no destination. Helen Fielding's list-making is curiously male in its obsessive precision and accuracy. The most engaging women's lists are like mini narratives, the sorts of lists you read in the journals of exotic adventurers like Amelia Earhart or Anais Nin. Some women's lists have been transformed into works of art - look at Tracey Emin's patchwork creation Everyone I've Ever Slept With 1963-1995. Video artist Jenny Holzer, who has an installation at Tate Modern, also thrives on lists, in her case alphabetical lists of mocking self-improvement slogans such as Boredom Makes You Do Crazy Things and Protect Me From What I Want. Gender experts would doubtless posit that this difference in approach is rooted in biology. In their excellent book Why Men Don't Iron (And Women Can't Map Read), Anne and Bill Moir explore the reasons why women tend to seek order over their environments and men just want to go out there and stake out their territory. Yes, you've guessed it, they agree that a Darwinian theory is the only one that makes any sense. Men apparently have a biological need to go off and conquer various aspects of nature (and by \"nature\" we can include odd anoraky terrain such as railway platforms), while women are left at home making sad lists about cake mix and plants. This is helpful at least when it comes to understanding why it is that in general men are incapable of making shopping lists; now we know it's because they are biologically programmed to go out and conquer the shelves, filling the trolley with as many useless items as possible, rather than making a list of things that might actually make a meal.",

It seems the mystery of men's emotional DNA has finally been revealed.</p> <p>According to Pasini, Stage One is the teenage years when males experience a surge of romantic passion that is really a form of puppy love. Real love turns up in Stage Two, when men in their 20s form the kind of emotional bonds that lead to marriage. Come their 30s and men enter Stage Three, known as the libertine phase, which means exploring sex inside and outside of marriage.</p> <p>Between 40 and 50, men hit Stage Four, start getting restless and are ripe for the middle-aged crisis.

In other words, they fall in love.\" Well, at least a third of the Italian men Pasini interviewed had fallen in love again in their 50s.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Pasini forgot to mention Stage Six in a man's life - the stage at which he's old enough to know that studies like this should be taken with a pinch of salt. Men are not programmed like washing machines to go through certain definite emotional, erotic and romantic cycles. I know men in their 40s and 50s who have experienced the puppy love passion of a teenager - and I have known teenagers who have experience the quiet desperation and disappointment of the middle-aged man with the midlife crisis.</p> <p>As for the \"libertine impulses\" that supposedly kick in around the 30s and 40s, I suspect for most men they first surface in puberty and stick around till death do part them from a lifetime of erotic desire.</p> <p>But while Pasini's study may seem like a piece of Aren't Men OK Research, it is in fact just the opposite.

The unstated subtext of their snigger is this: women in their 40s and 50s don't get restless and long for romantic passion. No, these sexually contented women stand by their men, no matter what! So while men are biologically programmed to fall in love at 50, women are built to stay faithful.</p> <p>Now, that's something worth laughing at. Of course some women do, but then so do many men. To his credit, Pasini's study does make the important and often forgotten point that some men faced with a midlife crisis feel a surge of passion and fall in love with their wives all over again.</p> <p>What his research doesn't reveal is that there are many women who have a Fifth Stage of their own and it's called: I'm Bored With This Marriage, Goodbye! I know because that's what my wife said to me one day and that's fair enough.

It is a view that has become the common wisdom of our age, simply because of high-profile celebrity splits like that of Michael Douglas and his wife Diandra.</p> <p>But for every fiftysomething male star who found love with a younger woman, there is a woman's tale, too. Take Francesca Annis, who dumped her long-term partner in favour of the younger Ralph Fiennes. If you think only men are prone to the midlife crisis sex fling, well, you should tell that to Meg Ryan who recently left her husband of many years, Dennis Quaid, to go off and make whoopee with Russell Crowe.</p> <p>And let us not forget the tabloids' favourite tale of the middle-aged man in search of young crumpet, Grant Bovey and Anthea Turner. What people forget is that not only did Grant, who was only 38 and thus should have been in Stage Four, leave his wife of seven years, but Anthea Turner left her husband, too.</p> <p>The real issue Pasini's study raises is not about how long-term marriages can survive men's biological drives. Rather, we have to deal with the fact that increasingly both men and women are no longer prepared to put up with the boredom and familiarity that comes when the fireworks of love have faded from a marriage. For when it comes to discovering true love or the reality of getting dumped, men and women are for once truly equal.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It is almost like a clich\u00e9 from a Mills &amp; Boon romance, but there is no escaping the reality that it was the passionflower cascading down the front of his handsome house beside the river Thames that changed the life of Leo Abse so completely and so unexpectedly. The old man was on his doorstep above the public towpath in Chiswick one sunny afternoon a couple of years ago when a beautiful young woman stopped to admire and ask about the flower.</p> <p>He is the wealthy retired solicitor and former Labour MP who was once the author of much private member's legislation on homosexual, marriage and family law reform. More latterly, since leaving the House of Commons in 1987, he has written books about the psychology of politics. He is 83 years old.</p> <p>She is Ania Czeputkowska, a former electrician from Gdansk in Poland, who came to Britain without a word of English, acquired a diploma in general arts and design, took a degree and got a first while working as a cleaning lady, won a bursary to the Royal College of Arts to study printed and textile design and has now just been awarded her master's. She has sold designs for fabric production in New York and to one of Britain's best-known wallpaper firms. She is 33 years old, and three weeks ago in the rather unglamorous surroundings of Hounslow register office she married Leo Abse. They have returned from honeymoon in a castle at Sintra in Portugal; they are tanned and happy, and exude a delighted contentment in each other. It is an unusual and enchanting story.</p> <p>Leo Abse was widowed five years ago. Marjorie, his wife of more than 40 years and the mother of his two grown children, died and left him desolate. He cut a sorry, bereft figure. \"Although I was holding on, it was tough,\" he says. \"It was an arid period. You behave stoically, but not happily.\" He has two brothers: the poet Danny and an elder brother, Wilfred, a distinguished psychoanalyst in the United States who rather shocked him by suggesting that he should snap out of himself and find a young woman. \"I had thought, 'I'm going to die a widower and this is the way of life I have to endure until my death.' \" Wilfred changed his thinking, and shortly afterwards Ania strolled into his life.</p> <p>In some ways the attraction was a classic one. Her father died of cancer when she was just one year old. Her mother, an administrator with the Polish national transport system, never remarried and raised Ania and her elder brother alone. As a child, Anya was a brilliant mathematician but an undiagnosed dyslexic until the age of 18. She found her Polish examinations, in subjects except maths, incredibly difficult. She fled them one year to come to England with a friend and spent two happy months picking strawberries near Colchester, living in a tent.</p> <p>Although she went home and worked as a precision mechanic, repairing irons and hair dryers, then as a technical demonstrator in the physics department at Gdansk University, she wanted to return to Britain. She supplemented her income at home by working as a florist, or selling vegetables, or being a parking warden, and eventually came to study art and learn English in London. She had one or two boyfriends, but they were not serious or didn't work out. Leo, she says, was the first man to make her feel like a woman.</p> <p>She was fascinated by him when they met. She knew nothing of British politics and little of psychology. He invited her and her girlfriend for tea to talk about passionflowers, he asked them round for a meal and then again. Her girlfriend teased her that he was \"after her\", and she became suspicious. He took her to the Savile Club, bought her wine, sent her perfume and lent her books, and she became more uneasy. She turned down further invitations, sent the perfume back and returned the books with a note which read: \"I don't think I am the woman you are looking for.\"</p> <p>Three weeks later she telephoned him again, and this time allowed a relationship to develop. After a while, exhausted from cycling between her job, her flat, her college and his house, she decided to move in. He suited her. She wanted to look after him. \"I let go of all the suspicion and I started listening to him,\" she says. \"We have made an effort. We somehow understand each other and there is a friendship that has been built up in the last year - to know each other you have got to live with each other, to see each other every day.\"</p> <p>\"She is an all-or-nothing woman,\" says Leo, admiringly. He remembers the moment when he realised they were going to have to get married. \"Here was this woman who is enormously creative, who has an ability to battle through and to stand on her own feet, who is formidable and who has won her way to the most prestigious art college in the country and yet who has time to notice that my socks had holes in because my toenails needed cutting.

      "bodyText": "It is almost like a clich\u00e9 from a Mills &amp; Boon romance, but there is no escaping the reality that it was the passionflower cascading down the front of his handsome house beside the river Thames that changed the life of Leo Abse so completely and so unexpectedly. The old man was on his doorstep above the public towpath in Chiswick one sunny afternoon a couple of years ago when a beautiful young woman stopped to admire and ask about the flower. He is the wealthy retired solicitor and former Labour MP who was once the author of much private member's legislation on homosexual, marriage and family law reform. More latterly, since leaving the House of Commons in 1987, he has written books about the psychology of politics. He is 83 years old. She is Ania Czeputkowska, a former electrician from Gdansk in Poland, who came to Britain without a word of English, acquired a diploma in general arts and design, took a degree and got a first while working as a cleaning lady, won a bursary to the Royal College of Arts to study printed and textile design and has now just been awarded her master's. She has sold designs for fabric production in New York and to one of Britain's best-known wallpaper firms. She is 33 years old, and three weeks ago in the rather unglamorous surroundings of Hounslow register office she married Leo Abse. They have returned from honeymoon in a castle at Sintra in Portugal; they are tanned and happy, and exude a delighted contentment in each other. It is an unusual and enchanting story. Leo Abse was widowed five years ago. Marjorie, his wife of more than 40 years and the mother of his two grown children, died and left him desolate. He cut a sorry, bereft figure. \"Although I was holding on, it was tough,\" he says. \"It was an arid period. You behave stoically, but not happily.\" He has two brothers: the poet Danny and an elder brother, Wilfred, a distinguished psychoanalyst in the United States who rather shocked him by suggesting that he should snap out of himself and find a young woman. \"I had thought, 'I'm going to die a widower and this is the way of life I have to endure until my death.' \" Wilfred changed his thinking, and shortly afterwards Ania strolled into his life. In some ways the attraction was a classic one. Her father died of cancer when she was just one year old. Her mother, an administrator with the Polish national transport system, never remarried and raised Ania and her elder brother alone. As a child, Anya was a brilliant mathematician but an undiagnosed dyslexic until the age of 18. She found her Polish examinations, in subjects except maths, incredibly difficult. She fled them one year to come to England with a friend and spent two happy months picking strawberries near Colchester, living in a tent. Although she went home and worked as a precision mechanic, repairing irons and hair dryers, then as a technical demonstrator in the physics department at Gdansk University, she wanted to return to Britain. She supplemented her income at home by working as a florist, or selling vegetables, or being a parking warden, and eventually came to study art and learn English in London. She had one or two boyfriends, but they were not serious or didn't work out. Leo, she says, was the first man to make her feel like a woman. She was fascinated by him when they met. She knew nothing of British politics and little of psychology. He invited her and her girlfriend for tea to talk about passionflowers, he asked them round for a meal and then again. Her girlfriend teased her that he was \"after her\", and she became suspicious. He took her to the Savile Club, bought her wine, sent her perfume and lent her books, and she became more uneasy. She turned down further invitations, sent the perfume back and returned the books with a note which read: \"I don't think I am the woman you are looking for.\" Three weeks later she telephoned him again, and this time allowed a relationship to develop. After a while, exhausted from cycling between her job, her flat, her college and his house, she decided to move in. He suited her. She wanted to look after him. \"I let go of all the suspicion and I started listening to him,\" she says. \"We have made an effort. We somehow understand each other and there is a friendship that has been built up in the last year - to know each other you have got to live with each other, to see each other every day.\" \"She is an all-or-nothing woman,\" says Leo, admiringly. He remembers the moment when he realised they were going to have to get married. \"Here was this woman who is enormously creative, who has an ability to battle through and to stand on her own feet, who is formidable and who has won her way to the most prestigious art college in the country and yet who has time to notice that my socks had holes in because my toenails needed cutting. It was when she was cutting my toenails that I realised I would have to marry Ania.\" They laugh delightedly at how prosaic this is. Neither of them is embarrassed about their love. Leo says that he is far too old to care what anybody else thinks and Ania is a woman who knows her own mind. Their homecoming has been a little marred, perhaps inevitably, by the excessive interest of the tabloid press. Leo Abse, with his fascination with psychoanalysis, understands this better than Ania, who has been tidying up the garden since they got back to Chiswick, filling nine bags with weeds and clippings rather than going out to face the intrusive lenses that have appeared from time to time on the doorstep. \"They really want a picture of her in a bikini,\" says Leo, chuckling with undisguised delight and mischief at his capacity to stir up controversy yet again. She, however, was a little upset and greatly astonished by the fact that in their absence on holiday the press pursued their friends and relatives across the continent. \"What disturbs them is the intergenerational relationship,\" says Leo. \"It can stir up fears. It is too near incest and the great taboo, of course, which has to be maintained to have an acceptable society is against incest. Freud said ...\" and he is off and away on his favourite subject. Ania listens with a commendable serenity for a while, until she starts to disagree. \"Hold on, Leo,\" she says. \"Hold on,\" she repeats when he doesn't hear her, for he is quite deaf.

She is less certain about raising children on her own, however capable she is.

And she wants to be able to emerge from her front door without being photographed. They chose to talk to the Guardian because they don't want their relationship sensationalised.

If you could weigh every human and all their domestic livestock, the scales would tip at 1.1bn tons - and every ounce of this living flesh depends on plant life. Humans are not just leaders in the field, they and their livestock consume most of the field. </p> <p>Consume is the word. There could be about 270,000 species of flowering plants already named, and perhaps another 50,000 to be identified. And, says Peter Crane, director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, around 30% of them are threatened. A quarter of them could vanish within 50 years. </p> <p>Which is why he is about to formally open a new kind of world bank to store the seeds of plants at risk for up to 200 years and push for yet more research into the green things that bankroll all animal life.

If you could weigh every human and all their domestic livestock, the scales would tip at 1.1bn tons - and every ounce of this living flesh depends on plant life. Humans are not just leaders in the field, they and their livestock consume most of the field. Consume is the word. There could be about 270,000 species of flowering plants already named, and perhaps another 50,000 to be identified. And, says Peter Crane, director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew in London, around 30% of them are threatened. A quarter of them could vanish within 50 years. Which is why he is about to formally open a new kind of world bank to store the seeds of plants at risk for up to 200 years and push for yet more research into the green things that bankroll all animal life.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Anthony Ogbise, 81, is among the few who have remained in Odi after the destruction. The Nigerian army came in the early hours, razing house after house, but carefully bypassing the banks and government offices, until they got to his door.</p> <p>\"They dragged me out and a captain said 'go and wash him', which meant they would kill me next to the river and dump me in the water.</p> <p>\"Somebody hit my arms and head with the butt of a gun. Another kicked me in the stomach. But they didn't kill me. They dragged me to their headquarters and beat me more.</p> <p>\"They used kerosene to burn the houses. I'm 81 years old. I'm not rich. I can't build a new house.\"</p> <p>There is not much left of Odi. Almost all its several thousand houses were burned by the soldiers. Hundreds of people were killed and buried in shallow graves beside the road. All but a few of the people fled.</p> <p>The destruction did not occur at the hands of one of Nigeria's repressive military dictatorships. It happened just nine months ago under the elected civilian government of Olusegun Obasanjo.</p> <p>The government blamed the army. The army accused militant Ijaw youths of provoking the attack by murdering a group of policemen in the town. The youths said the government was to blame, because it failed to fulfil its promise of relief for the Niger delta.</p> <p>The region's misery is well documented. The 2m barrels of oil pumped from the delta each day provides more than 90% of Nigeria's foreign income. The delta communities have little to show for it beyond contamination, repression, and an ever more restless younger generation which has found violence, hostage-taking and extortion in place of jobs.</p> <p><b> Changes for the worse</b><br></p> <p>Today the burnt-out houses stand as a monument to the failed hope that democratic rule would rescue the delta. Its blighted communities looked to the new government to ensure that the region benefited from the riches it gives up. But a bill to set up a development commission to return some of the oil profits to the delta is stuck in the national assembly, a victim of the endless feuding between MPs and President Obasanjo.</p> <p>\"Things haven't improved,\" said Oronto Douglas, one of the more militant of the Ijaw youth leaders and head of the Pan Niger Delta Resistance Movement.</p> <p>\"In some instances they've actually got worse. There is a general belief, especially in the west, that the coming to power of Obasanjo has changed things for the better. I would say he is practising dictatorial democracy.</p> <p>\"It is democracy designed by dictators and run by an ex-dictator for the benefit of the cronies and hangers on.\"</p> <p>Compounding the misery is the phenomenon of oil pipeline explosions. A month ago 312 villagers scooping fuel from a burst pipeline deep in the bush at Viri-Court were killed when two wheelbarrows carrying off the plundered oil collided and provided the spark for the blast, which extended almost a mile along the pipe. Trees as far as five miles away were scorched.</p> <p><b> An organised racket</b><br></p> <p>The survivors, many of them children with third-degree burns over much of their bodies, can be found in local hospitals. Many others with serious injuries refused to go to hospital, despite the authorities' assurance that they would not be arrested for stealing fuel.</p> <p>A week later 18 died in a similar blast two miles away. A week after that it was 40 near Sapele.

      "bodyText": "Anthony Ogbise, 81, is among the few who have remained in Odi after the destruction. The Nigerian army came in the early hours, razing house after house, but carefully bypassing the banks and government offices, until they got to his door. \"They dragged me out and a captain said 'go and wash him', which meant they would kill me next to the river and dump me in the water. \"Somebody hit my arms and head with the butt of a gun. Another kicked me in the stomach. But they didn't kill me. They dragged me to their headquarters and beat me more. \"They used kerosene to burn the houses. I'm 81 years old. I'm not rich. I can't build a new house.\" There is not much left of Odi. Almost all its several thousand houses were burned by the soldiers. Hundreds of people were killed and buried in shallow graves beside the road. All but a few of the people fled. The destruction did not occur at the hands of one of Nigeria's repressive military dictatorships. It happened just nine months ago under the elected civilian government of Olusegun Obasanjo. The government blamed the army. The army accused militant Ijaw youths of provoking the attack by murdering a group of policemen in the town. The youths said the government was to blame, because it failed to fulfil its promise of relief for the Niger delta. The region's misery is well documented. The 2m barrels of oil pumped from the delta each day provides more than 90% of Nigeria's foreign income. The delta communities have little to show for it beyond contamination, repression, and an ever more restless younger generation which has found violence, hostage-taking and extortion in place of jobs. Changes for the worse Today the burnt-out houses stand as a monument to the failed hope that democratic rule would rescue the delta. Its blighted communities looked to the new government to ensure that the region benefited from the riches it gives up. But a bill to set up a development commission to return some of the oil profits to the delta is stuck in the national assembly, a victim of the endless feuding between MPs and President Obasanjo. \"Things haven't improved,\" said Oronto Douglas, one of the more militant of the Ijaw youth leaders and head of the Pan Niger Delta Resistance Movement. \"In some instances they've actually got worse. There is a general belief, especially in the west, that the coming to power of Obasanjo has changed things for the better. I would say he is practising dictatorial democracy. \"It is democracy designed by dictators and run by an ex-dictator for the benefit of the cronies and hangers on.\" Compounding the misery is the phenomenon of oil pipeline explosions. A month ago 312 villagers scooping fuel from a burst pipeline deep in the bush at Viri-Court were killed when two wheelbarrows carrying off the plundered oil collided and provided the spark for the blast, which extended almost a mile along the pipe. Trees as far as five miles away were scorched. An organised racket The survivors, many of them children with third-degree burns over much of their bodies, can be found in local hospitals. Many others with serious injuries refused to go to hospital, despite the authorities' assurance that they would not be arrested for stealing fuel. A week later 18 died in a similar blast two miles away. A week after that it was 40 near Sapele. In all, more than 2,000 people have been killed in pipeline explosions in the past two years. The oil companies accuse villagers of breaching the pipes, either to steal the fuel or to claim compensation for the resulting pollution. But in one recent explosion it was clear that the pipe was so old that it had fallen apart. There is also evidence of a well-organised racket involving the police, army and employees of the state oil company, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. The NNPC concedes as much by saying that it is not easy to breach a pipeline. \"Our engineers have told us that vandalisation of oil pipelines takes a scientific process which ordinary villagers can't engage in,\" its spokesman, Ndu Ughamadu, said. \"There must be well-placed people that have links with this pipeline vandalisation.

We worried that we had the highest divorce rate and the longest working hours in Europe, and that the two statistics were linked. Beyond them, lay worse: the highest number of single parents and the largest proportion of children living in poverty.</p> <p>There has been no shortage of genuine concern within the government. Harriet Harman was at the forefront of initiatives to ease the pressures on working mothers. That is what makes her leaked memo yesterday, warning of the difficulties of extending parental leave for small businesses, all the more surprising. One never expected Ms Harman to be the one to call for a slow-down. But her old friend, Patricia Hewitt at the Department of Trade and Industry, is under acute pressure from small businesses ahead of the green paper on parental rights due in the autumn.</p> <p>Ms Harman's concerns are taken further in an Industrial Society pamphlet, \"Mothers versus men\", published yesterday. It argues that the current structure of maternity leave can backfire, opening women up to discrimination. Prospective employers can be deterred from employing, training or promoting women because of the costs and inconveniences of their maternity rights. This is where the pattern of discrimination sets in, setting men and women on radically different career trajectories, which results in the stubborn 20% pay gap between women and men. Motherhood, it concludes, carries a heavy penalty in earning power.</p> <p>The solution to inequality in the workplace, the pamphlet claims, is to institute equality in the home. Everything else has been tried to reduce the pay gap the equal pay act, corporate and government initiatives... Now, we must go radical. The priority for campaigners, it argues, should be to equalise parental rights rather than extending maternity rights. Only when men are encouraged to take a fuller role in the care of children - equality in the home - will there be equality in the workplace. And to ensure that the message gets out loud and clear from the top of every organisation, the government should offer 90% of take home pay even to top executives for six weeks' parental leave. Level the playing field.</p> <p>This is wonderful stuff. The kids would love dad around. What woman would not love her partner to pitch in, keep track of the children's inoculations, remember their PE kit - in short, apply some of their management skills to their home life? If men devoted as much time and energy to parenting as women do, it would certainly undermine patterns of discrimination and revolutionise our work culture into becoming less pressurised and more family-friendly. But this thinking is close to utopian. It ignores a quickening global economy and technological change which have considerably increased the pressures on employees. It overlooks the choices men are making every day to work long hours, thus missing the school-run and bathtime: male identity is still powerfully linked to the competitiveness and ambition of the office. Until that alters, giving men generous paternity leave instead of extending women's maternity leave would be a waste of legislative effort.</p>",

But her old friend, Patricia Hewitt at the Department of Trade and Industry, is under acute pressure from small businesses ahead of the green paper on parental rights due in the autumn. Ms Harman's concerns are taken further in an Industrial Society pamphlet, \"Mothers versus men\", published yesterday. It argues that the current structure of maternity leave can backfire, opening women up to discrimination. Prospective employers can be deterred from employing, training or promoting women because of the costs and inconveniences of their maternity rights. This is where the pattern of discrimination sets in, setting men and women on radically different career trajectories, which results in the stubborn 20% pay gap between women and men. Motherhood, it concludes, carries a heavy penalty in earning power. The solution to inequality in the workplace, the pamphlet claims, is to institute equality in the home. Everything else has been tried to reduce the pay gap the equal pay act, corporate and government initiatives... Now, we must go radical. The priority for campaigners, it argues, should be to equalise parental rights rather than extending maternity rights. Only when men are encouraged to take a fuller role in the care of children - equality in the home - will there be equality in the workplace. And to ensure that the message gets out loud and clear from the top of every organisation, the government should offer 90% of take home pay even to top executives for six weeks' parental leave. Level the playing field. This is wonderful stuff. The kids would love dad around. What woman would not love her partner to pitch in, keep track of the children's inoculations, remember their PE kit - in short, apply some of their management skills to their home life? If men devoted as much time and energy to parenting as women do, it would certainly undermine patterns of discrimination and revolutionise our work culture into becoming less pressurised and more family-friendly. But this thinking is close to utopian. It ignores a quickening global economy and technological change which have considerably increased the pressures on employees. It overlooks the choices men are making every day to work long hours, thus missing the school-run and bathtime: male identity is still powerfully linked to the competitiveness and ambition of the office. Until that alters, giving men generous paternity leave instead of extending women's maternity leave would be a waste of legislative effort.",

In 1947, she created the character of Nancy in Britten's next opera, Albert Herring, and then appeared as Polly Peachum in his original adaptation of The Beggar's Opera. In 1951, she was Dido in Britten's realisation of Purcell's Dido and Aeneas, and the following year she created another new part, Lucinda Woodcock in Arthur Oldham's modern version of Thomas Arne's ballad opera Love in a Village.

He was arrested in June after his bul letin board for missing people in China began to carry discussion on democracy and human rights. It, too, can now be found (in Chinese) on the HRIC site. </p> <p>Beijing may have taken time to wake up to the internet revolution, but it is not underestimating it now. A few days after New Culture was shut down, the Communist Party deployed its most powerful propaganda voice, the People's Daily newspaper, to warn 60 million members to take the web seriously. </p> <p>This strong language reveals the extent of Beijing's concern - which seems to stem from the personal interest of Chinese president and party boss Jiang Zemin himself. </p> <p>The People's Daily commentary described the world-wide internet revolution as \"great, rapid and extensive\" (da-kuai-guang) - adjectives once used to hail China's Great Leap Forward (1958-60). The opportunity it offered for media management and propaganda, it continued, was a \"new phenomenon\" (xin shiwu) - the term once used to described the alleged achievements of the Cultural Revolution (1966-76). </p> <p>The thrust of the argument was almost military in style. The internet, said the People's Daily, has become a new arena for struggle between the \"correct propaganda\" of the government and the \"reactionary, superstitious and pornographic\" content of China's enemies. </p> <p>Party authorities all over China should form crack units of web fighters who understand politics and news management, and have a good command of foreign languages, to wage battle with the enemy \"at home and abroad\". </p> <p>No one can accuse the inheritors of the Chinese revolution of underestimating the power of the internet revolution. They share Bill Clinton's fervent belief, openly expressed on his summit in Beijing two years ago, that the web will be the harbinger of Chinese democracy. The only difference is that they want to stop it happening. </p> <p>Is the internet really such a potent force in China, and if so, can it be exploited, by either side, for a political purpose? The argument is still open. The latest estimate by the official China internet Network Information Center shows the number of users at 16.9 million in June his year - about the same number as in South Korea with a population one-twentieth of China's size. </p> <p>The real figure to watch is the rate of growth, which the Center calculates at just under 90% in the first six months of this year. This may not continue at the same rate: the high cost of access may be as important a limitation as the ability to purchase the hardware. Yet it would be unwise - and contrary to experience elsewhere in the world - to make projections too low for the future. With the Chinese media now devoting significant space to internet news, access to the web is already a major status symbol for China's fast- growing urban middle class. </p> <p>The latest government regulations are as much directed against pornography and false advertising (especially in the medical field) as against political non-conformity. But they also seek to limit - indeed to outlaw - the dissemination of unauthorised news, whether from home or abroad. All providers must now obtain a certificate from the Ministry of Information Industry before \"releasing information\" on a website. Beijing has also boosted the promotion of nine official news websites operated by national news organisations such as the People's Daily. </p> <p>The latest government move will accentuate a trend already noticeable among Chinese commercial sites away from news towards entertainment and lifestyle, consumer affairs and e-commerce. </p> <p>Some of the lifestyle sites tackle gender and sex issues with a frankness which would finish off the last remaining Party veterans if they knew how to click on a icon. Gaogenxie.com, one of several new sites which says it targets the \"modern Chinese woman\", has a Q &amp; A folder on sexual problems which leaves nothing unsaid. </p> <p>The star letter on the current site, which needs special software to be accessed, is from a newly married woman whose husband is so shy about the size of his penis that he gets undressed in the dark. Gaogenxie (the site name means \"high heel shoes\") offers advice on how to make him feel better in bed. </p> <p>The Shanghai-based Etang.com, also a newcomer, has chosen as its target the Yellow Generation - defined as China's young and emerging middle-class aged 18-35. The term, registered as a trade mark, is intended to contrast with the rather older Red Generation, who grew up in the Maoist 1960s and 1970s. Etang offers advice on house buying, male fashion and job hunting. </p> <p>E-commerce is the vogue word for many of these new sites but, in a country with virtually no mechanism for credit card payment, it is unlikely to be their salvation. China now has 9,000 commercial websites, of which 2,000 are pure dot.coms: a severe shake-out is expected as the dot.com bubble bursts. </p> <p>Because of official hesitation, Chinese hi-tech companies only made their debut on Nasdaq earlier this year and it has been a dismal one. Of the four leading companies which launched their shares - <a href=\"http://Sina.com\" target=\"_new\">http://Sina.com</a>, <a href=\"http://China.com\" target=\"_New\">http://China.com</a>, <a href=\"http://Netease.com\" target=\"_NEW\">http://Netease.com</a> and <a href=\"http://Sohu.com\" target=\"_NEW\"> http://Sohu.com</a> - only Sina.com is still ahead of the game. </p> <p>Is China's current enthusiasm for the internet just another \"fever\" - the latest in a succession over the past 20 years since the Chinese lost faith in socialism? </p> <p>It has some of the lavish and short-sighted characteristics of the \"market fever\" of recent years. Many Chinese dot.com companies have formed large employee teams, rented office space in prestigious sites, and spent freely on salaries and perks. </p> <p>The shake-out has already started as dot.com sites run out of cash: China's own venture capitalists have only invested a minute sum - about 100 million renminbi (\u00a38 million) - in online firms. </p> <p>\"A cloud of religion has been hanging over China's internet development,\" says an article in the Beijing-based China Daily. \"Yahoo and Amazon are the totems, and the Nasdaq is the Mecca.\" </p> <p>The China Daily criticises the illusion that China can \"catch up\" with the West via rapid expansion of the internet, comparing it with the disastrous campaign in the late 1950s to \"catch up\" with the US and Britain by boosting China's iron and steel production to unrealistic heights. </p> <p>There is indeed an air of illusion about the official campaign to encourage every Chinese province - particularly the poorer ones in the west - to invest in web infrastructure as if it were a passport to development. </p> <p>Provincial Party bosses now boast about their ability to offer instant internet access for foreign business visitors and entrepreneurs. It has almost become another target to over-achieve. Yet even if there is a dot.com slump the internet revolution is not going to come to a halt. </p> <p>Much more substantial investment is taking place in less volatile hi-tech industries producing hardware and software. Beijing's own Silicon Valley at the Zhongguancun Science and Technology Park continues to expand, and Shanghai has begun to take off. </p> <p>A significant reverse brain drain of Chinese ex-students returning home is helping to supply the industries with new talent. \"The future lies with you,\" Chairman Mao once told the revolutionary youth of China. </p> <p>Today the revolution may be on-screen rather than on the streets and it will have - as Mao also said - its \"twists and turns\". But in spite of the web-police the Communist Party will find it harder year by year to contain. </p> <p>\u0095 Download Chinese fonts from <a href=\"http://chinese.yahoo.com/docs/info/setup.html\" target=\"_new\">http://chinese.yahoo.com/docs/info/setup.html</a></p>",

The shake-out has already started as dot.com sites run out of cash: China's own venture capitalists have only invested a minute sum - about 100 million renminbi (\u00a38 million) - in online firms. \"A cloud of religion has been hanging over China's internet development,\" says an article in the Beijing-based China Daily. \"Yahoo and Amazon are the totems, and the Nasdaq is the Mecca.\" The China Daily criticises the illusion that China can \"catch up\" with the West via rapid expansion of the internet, comparing it with the disastrous campaign in the late 1950s to \"catch up\" with the US and Britain by boosting China's iron and steel production to unrealistic heights. There is indeed an air of illusion about the official campaign to encourage every Chinese province - particularly the poorer ones in the west - to invest in web infrastructure as if it were a passport to development. Provincial Party bosses now boast about their ability to offer instant internet access for foreign business visitors and entrepreneurs. It has almost become another target to over-achieve. Yet even if there is a dot.com slump the internet revolution is not going to come to a halt. Much more substantial investment is taking place in less volatile hi-tech industries producing hardware and software. Beijing's own Silicon Valley at the Zhongguancun Science and Technology Park continues to expand, and Shanghai has begun to take off. A significant reverse brain drain of Chinese ex-students returning home is helping to supply the industries with new talent. \"The future lies with you,\" Chairman Mao once told the revolutionary youth of China. Today the revolution may be on-screen rather than on the streets and it will have - as Mao also said - its \"twists and turns\". But in spite of the web-police the Communist Party will find it harder year by year to contain. \u0095 Download Chinese fonts from http://chinese.yahoo.com/docs/info/setup.html",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>On a warm Irish evening, flat-screened computer monitors glow bluely and strange electronic noises blend with the bark of conversation on the top floor of an old brick warehouse, once part of the Guinness brewery. The remodelled building, now all-glass skylights, exposed brick and freshly sanded wood, is the new home of Media Lab Europe, the Dublin-based independent arm of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's famously eclectic Media Lab. </p> <p>The Irish digerati sipped wine - no Guinness was served - as Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern drifted by, Media Lab and MLE director Nicholas Negroponte at his elbow. MIT artificial intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky chatted to clusters of the Irish research students who, unlike many of the industry invitees, knew his name and significance. In various corners, Media Lab students demonstrated the kind of intelligent, off-the-wall projects that should make MLE one of the funkier places in Europe to work and study. Rumours circled that rock star Bono, an MLE fan, would show up. So far, so Media Lab. </p> <p>But MLE is not intended to be a clone of the Massachusetts facility. Already, a quiet revolution is underway by its initial faculty to make MLE what MIT's Media Lab has never really been - a cutting-edge arts institute as well as research center, where the strong arts element often present in Media Lab work will not be subordinate to the technology used to create it. </p> <p>The Media Lab has always stressed art and artists. \"One of the reasons we have such a focus on the arts is that Nicholas had the intuition that we had come up with a completely different response [to questions about technology] because of that,\" says Tod Machover, the MIT associate professor of music and media who will also be one of MLE's first faculty members. </p> <p>\"The arts, which started out at MIT as the farthest, wackiest fringe, has become a central part and touches nearly everyone at the Media Lab,\" Machover says. Students come to Media Lab for that reason. \"You can't say this person is an artist or a technologist,\" says Machover. \"Many of these students think of these issues together.\" But he and other researchers speaking at a two-day launch symposium say the Media Lab still tends to forefront the technology that delivers the work of art, rather than the work itself, while the wider art community has been wary of computer-derived work. </p> <p>\"We have had to work very hard to make sure that we got recognition from both sides of the fence,\" said Barry Vercoe, professor of music and media arts and science. \"I think MLE is able to leapfrog over that hard work and have a new beginning.\" </p> <p>MLE, a 150 million punt collaboration between MIT Media Lab and the Irish government, will operate from September as an independent European, university-level research and educational centre. Still embryonic in structure, the facility will grow to a faculty of 55, drawn from Europe and the Media Lab in Massachusetts, and host 200 students. While education and e-commerce are also intended to be a focus of MLE - the Irish government pushed for and will help fund the development of an affiliated digital village of e-commerce companies - the digital arts are clearly at the heart of the institute. </p> <p>\"MLE is new. It's a new space, a new context, a new set of people,\" says Glorianna Davenport, head of the interactive cinema group at Media Lab. Davenport has been MIT's key person on the ground in the Republic since the Irish government announced the initiative last December. She will join Machover as one of the first researchers in Dublin, and the broad interests of the two will undoubtedly shape MLE's future. Davenport has been pushing at the edge of narrative, considering new ways of telling stories that can be fractured and united using a network of computers. </p> <p>Machover is the much-feted inventor of a massive interactive music experience called Brain Opera <a href=\"http://brainop.media.mit.edu\" target=\"_new\">http://brainop.media.mit.edu</a>, which has found a permanent home at Vienna's new House of Music, an interactive museum. Brain Opera has a score composed partly in advance by Machover, and partly by visitors to the installation, who can \"play\" a roomful of colourful, otherworldly instruments. \"It's an opera about what happens when we listen to music,\" he says, noting that he based the opera on Marvin Minsky's seminal work, the Society of Mind. </p> <p>Machover has other projects in the works as well, for example, Toy Symphony, a collaboration between music experts and children that will utilise a range of music toys. \"I think children have to be brought into the arts and music world as collaborators, not as students,\" he says. \"I'm acutely aware of how little music training there is for children.\" </p> <p>Like Machover, Davenport is particularly interested in breaking through the existing boundaries between art forms and move to something entirely new - although no one seems sure what that format might be. \"We have gotten to the point with the technology that it gives us enormous opportunity to reinvent or newly invent form,\" she says. \"We need to figure out what comes after theatre, what comes after cinema,\" says Machover. Senior research scientist Walter Bender agrees. \"There's a totally new, major scale art form that we haven't built yet.\" </p> <p>They hope MLE will host its creation. The Republic is \"about the right size\" for a very big undertaking, and does not have the strict, constraining administrative and artistic hierarchies that he has experienced elsewhere in Europe, Machover says. He adds that MLE has acquired a neighbouring building and plans to convert into a large performance space. \"One of our ideas is that it is an ideal space to have performances, interactivity on a large scale. Our hope is that there will be a lot of performances here.\" </p> <p>\"We're at the threshold of the way we look at arts and digital technology, and how we use them is about to change,\" says Bender. \"We have a digital golden age before us.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "On a warm Irish evening, flat-screened computer monitors glow bluely and strange electronic noises blend with the bark of conversation on the top floor of an old brick warehouse, once part of the Guinness brewery. The remodelled building, now all-glass skylights, exposed brick and freshly sanded wood, is the new home of Media Lab Europe, the Dublin-based independent arm of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's famously eclectic Media Lab. The Irish digerati sipped wine - no Guinness was served - as Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern drifted by, Media Lab and MLE director Nicholas Negroponte at his elbow. MIT artificial intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky chatted to clusters of the Irish research students who, unlike many of the industry invitees, knew his name and significance. In various corners, Media Lab students demonstrated the kind of intelligent, off-the-wall projects that should make MLE one of the funkier places in Europe to work and study. Rumours circled that rock star Bono, an MLE fan, would show up. So far, so Media Lab. But MLE is not intended to be a clone of the Massachusetts facility. Already, a quiet revolution is underway by its initial faculty to make MLE what MIT's Media Lab has never really been - a cutting-edge arts institute as well as research center, where the strong arts element often present in Media Lab work will not be subordinate to the technology used to create it. The Media Lab has always stressed art and artists. \"One of the reasons we have such a focus on the arts is that Nicholas had the intuition that we had come up with a completely different response [to questions about technology] because of that,\" says Tod Machover, the MIT associate professor of music and media who will also be one of MLE's first faculty members. \"The arts, which started out at MIT as the farthest, wackiest fringe, has become a central part and touches nearly everyone at the Media Lab,\" Machover says. Students come to Media Lab for that reason. \"You can't say this person is an artist or a technologist,\" says Machover. \"Many of these students think of these issues together.\" But he and other researchers speaking at a two-day launch symposium say the Media Lab still tends to forefront the technology that delivers the work of art, rather than the work itself, while the wider art community has been wary of computer-derived work. \"We have had to work very hard to make sure that we got recognition from both sides of the fence,\" said Barry Vercoe, professor of music and media arts and science. \"I think MLE is able to leapfrog over that hard work and have a new beginning.\" MLE, a 150 million punt collaboration between MIT Media Lab and the Irish government, will operate from September as an independent European, university-level research and educational centre. Still embryonic in structure, the facility will grow to a faculty of 55, drawn from Europe and the Media Lab in Massachusetts, and host 200 students. While education and e-commerce are also intended to be a focus of MLE - the Irish government pushed for and will help fund the development of an affiliated digital village of e-commerce companies - the digital arts are clearly at the heart of the institute. \"MLE is new. It's a new space, a new context, a new set of people,\" says Glorianna Davenport, head of the interactive cinema group at Media Lab. Davenport has been MIT's key person on the ground in the Republic since the Irish government announced the initiative last December. She will join Machover as one of the first researchers in Dublin, and the broad interests of the two will undoubtedly shape MLE's future. Davenport has been pushing at the edge of narrative, considering new ways of telling stories that can be fractured and united using a network of computers. Machover is the much-feted inventor of a massive interactive music experience called Brain Opera http://brainop.media.mit.edu, which has found a permanent home at Vienna's new House of Music, an interactive museum. Brain Opera has a score composed partly in advance by Machover, and partly by visitors to the installation, who can \"play\" a roomful of colourful, otherworldly instruments. \"It's an opera about what happens when we listen to music,\" he says, noting that he based the opera on Marvin Minsky's seminal work, the Society of Mind. Machover has other projects in the works as well, for example, Toy Symphony, a collaboration between music experts and children that will utilise a range of music toys. \"I think children have to be brought into the arts and music world as collaborators, not as students,\" he says. \"I'm acutely aware of how little music training there is for children.\" Like Machover, Davenport is particularly interested in breaking through the existing boundaries between art forms and move to something entirely new - although no one seems sure what that format might be. \"We have gotten to the point with the technology that it gives us enormous opportunity to reinvent or newly invent form,\" she says. \"We need to figure out what comes after theatre, what comes after cinema,\" says Machover. Senior research scientist Walter Bender agrees. \"There's a totally new, major scale art form that we haven't built yet.\" They hope MLE will host its creation. The Republic is \"about the right size\" for a very big undertaking, and does not have the strict, constraining administrative and artistic hierarchies that he has experienced elsewhere in Europe, Machover says. He adds that MLE has acquired a neighbouring building and plans to convert into a large performance space. \"One of our ideas is that it is an ideal space to have performances, interactivity on a large scale. Our hope is that there will be a lot of performances here.\" \"We're at the threshold of the way we look at arts and digital technology, and how we use them is about to change,\" says Bender. \"We have a digital golden age before us.\"",

Patrick and his friend Terry were my prize pupils at the large rural secondary school in Eastern Province. They were both reading Oscar Wilde while the others were struggling to complete a correct sentence.</p> <p>Once we read an extract with the word \"gargoyle\" in it, which they loved. \"You look very gargoyle,\" they said, smirking, to an unsuspecting female class-mate. \"Thank you,\" she replied, sure that she was receiving a compliment. Now, two years later, Terry is stacking shelves at Shoprite, the South African supermarket chain, and Patrick is wandering from one aunt to another, marking time. The university was closed for a year in 1998, and has still not caught up. Besides, they do not have the money to pay the fees.</p> <p>\"I'm desperate,\" Patrick writes to me in Kenya, where I now live. I decide I must pay him a visit. The only address I have is New Hope Bible Church, Lilanda.</p> <p>\"New Hope?\"</p> <p>\"Ah,\" says the young man, looking into the distance. \"Ah - but that one I don't know.\"</p> <p>Eventually we find it. A little tin shack. A woman is excited when I say who I am. \"Please take him with you to Kenya,\" she begs. \"He is so smart, and there is nothing for him here.\"</p> <p>We decide that Patrick should come and visit me in Kenya: perhaps I can find a course for him to do. But he will need a passport. The first time he goes alone to the passport office, but cannot get the form because they are only given out in the mornings. One reason why Zambia is in its current predicament is because the culture is particularly humble and submissive. In many of the schools outside the main urban areas children are still expected to kneel before adults, and to speak in the hushed tones of deep respect. Far be it for such a well-brought-up young man to question a superior. He must come back tomorrow.</p> <p>The next day I accompany him, and we get as far as filling in the form and getting it \"recommended\". This needs to be done by a magistrate, but for those in a hurry or who do not have access to the great and the good, there is someone on hand to do the job. His office is a shambolic collection of junk: an ancient vacuum cleaner, tyres and boxes.</p> <p>\"Ah,\" he points out, somewhat gleefully. \"He must get his father to sign.\"</p> <p>\"What? He's 22,\" I say.</p> <p>It turns out that the compulsory National Registration Card must be obtained by all citizens by the age of 16. Patrick applied for his at 18, so he had to knock several years off his age - an arbitrary matter, it seems, easily done as birth certificates are as rare as horse manure. Suddenly he is relegated to boyhood.</p> <p>Another delay while he goes hunting for his wayward alcoholic father.</p> <p>The next day we return to the official. \"How much?\" I ask.</p> <p>\"Mostly we charge ZK10,000 ($4).\"</p> <p>\"Mostly?\"</p> <p>\"I'll just take 10,000 this time because this is a small boy.\"</p> <p>Patrick happens to be quite tall, but we don't quibble. Next step, he tells us, is an interview. Why?</p> <p>\"Ah, you see,\" says the official, taking us into his confidence. \"There are people who pretend to be Zambians because they want a passport, but really they are from Zimbabwe. So the interview is there to test if they are genuine.\"</p> <p>The interview is not very taxing. A bullish woman in a dark blue suit and sparkling earrings leafs through the application silently.</p> <p>\"Hm. You're from Mishoro. Who is the chief there?\"</p> <p>\"Chief Mishoro.\"</p> <p>Excellent. Ten out of ten. He has passed the critical nationality test.</p> <p>\"Where will you be going when you get your passport?\" You can hear her brain ticking away, trying to find out how this \"small boy\" comes to be with this white lady.</p> <p>\"Kenya. To study mass communication.\"</p> <p>\"You can't study that here?\" she barks.</p> <p>\"No.\"</p> <p>We are allowed to leave with our precious document. By now it is too late to pay the ZK72,000 ($17). He will have to come tomorrow. This is already day five. I give him the money and he goes back the next day, only to reach the counter just as it is about to close.</p> <p>I am now giving him lessons in \"How to Survive in the Modern World Without Appearing Rude or Arrogant.\"</p> <p>Repeat after me:</p> <p>\"I am very sorry, sir, but I am unemployed and it costs me ZK2,000 each time I come into town.\"</p> <p>No doubt my efforts will be in vain. After all, who can these people kick if not someone lower down?</p>",

Now, two years later, Terry is stacking shelves at Shoprite, the South African supermarket chain, and Patrick is wandering from one aunt to another, marking time. The university was closed for a year in 1998, and has still not caught up. Besides, they do not have the money to pay the fees. \"I'm desperate,\" Patrick writes to me in Kenya, where I now live. I decide I must pay him a visit. The only address I have is New Hope Bible Church, Lilanda. \"New Hope?\" \"Ah,\" says the young man, looking into the distance. \"Ah - but that one I don't know.\" Eventually we find it. A little tin shack. A woman is excited when I say who I am. \"Please take him with you to Kenya,\" she begs. \"He is so smart, and there is nothing for him here.\" We decide that Patrick should come and visit me in Kenya: perhaps I can find a course for him to do. But he will need a passport. The first time he goes alone to the passport office, but cannot get the form because they are only given out in the mornings. One reason why Zambia is in its current predicament is because the culture is particularly humble and submissive. In many of the schools outside the main urban areas children are still expected to kneel before adults, and to speak in the hushed tones of deep respect. Far be it for such a well-brought-up young man to question a superior. He must come back tomorrow. The next day I accompany him, and we get as far as filling in the form and getting it \"recommended\". This needs to be done by a magistrate, but for those in a hurry or who do not have access to the great and the good, there is someone on hand to do the job. His office is a shambolic collection of junk: an ancient vacuum cleaner, tyres and boxes. \"Ah,\" he points out, somewhat gleefully. \"He must get his father to sign.\" \"What? He's 22,\" I say. It turns out that the compulsory National Registration Card must be obtained by all citizens by the age of 16. Patrick applied for his at 18, so he had to knock several years off his age - an arbitrary matter, it seems, easily done as birth certificates are as rare as horse manure. Suddenly he is relegated to boyhood. Another delay while he goes hunting for his wayward alcoholic father. The next day we return to the official. \"How much?\" I ask. \"Mostly we charge ZK10,000 ($4).\" \"Mostly?\" \"I'll just take 10,000 this time because this is a small boy.\" Patrick happens to be quite tall, but we don't quibble. Next step, he tells us, is an interview. Why? \"Ah, you see,\" says the official, taking us into his confidence. \"There are people who pretend to be Zambians because they want a passport, but really they are from Zimbabwe. So the interview is there to test if they are genuine.\" The interview is not very taxing. A bullish woman in a dark blue suit and sparkling earrings leafs through the application silently. \"Hm. You're from Mishoro. Who is the chief there?\" \"Chief Mishoro.\" Excellent. Ten out of ten. He has passed the critical nationality test. \"Where will you be going when you get your passport?\" You can hear her brain ticking away, trying to find out how this \"small boy\" comes to be with this white lady. \"Kenya. To study mass communication.\" \"You can't study that here?\" she barks. \"No.\" We are allowed to leave with our precious document. By now it is too late to pay the ZK72,000 ($17). He will have to come tomorrow. This is already day five. I give him the money and he goes back the next day, only to reach the counter just as it is about to close. I am now giving him lessons in \"How to Survive in the Modern World Without Appearing Rude or Arrogant.\" Repeat after me: \"I am very sorry, sir, but I am unemployed and it costs me ZK2,000 each time I come into town.\" No doubt my efforts will be in vain. After all, who can these people kick if not someone lower down?",

Yet the crisis the book talks of isn't really one of masculinity but one of faith, or lack of it.

Much of Clare's knottily detailed analysis is an attempt to prove, in the face of what he regards as an inherently threatening gender-politicised feminist climate, that certain basic things are true. That divorce isn't necessarily the best solution for couples at loggerheads, as one-parent apologists have claimed; that children from divorced families tend not to perform as well educationally or emotionally; that the now fashionably redundant father is better present than absent; and that there's an innate psychodynamic weakness in the single-parent family that makes it an unreliable ideal.</p> <p>Seeking an accommodation, a healing therapy of mutual respect capable of resolving these long-entrenched divisions, he argues powerfully against the purely chemical or biological determinism that holds that men are the helpless, testosterone-fuelled prisoners of their genes.

Clare prefers to deal with the sociological implications of masculine behaviour. The part-science and part-shamanism of psychiatric thinking has always had its wilfully blind side. Just as in a religious age the workings of chance and organic illness were ascribed to the will of God, so the psychotherapeutic creeds of the past 100 years - which distrust the purely accidental as much as the conventionally religious used to do - make the mind or the psyche conjecturally responsible for everything that the body feels or is obliged to sustain.</p> <p>We live, as a result, in a stubbornly psychosomatic era, seeing in all our malaise and misfortune some rectifiable dysfunction of our individual selves.

      "body": "<p>'Allah take care of the crew on board; let angels surround the dhow. May Allah bring them back home safe to the beloved waiting afar.\" So sang an Omani sailor in a prayer for Dionisius Agius. Thirty kilometres north of Sur in south-east Oman you can look down from the hills to the ruins of a once mighty city which faces the sea, the port of Qalhat with its shattered towers, fallen houses and narrow winding streets. </p> <p>Qalhat was prosperous until 1508 when it was devastated by the Portuguese. Dr Tom Vosmer, from the Australian Maritime Museum in Freemantle, Australia, organised a team of archeologists to explore Qalhat. He was aided by the Omani Navy, whose most successful contribution, according to the researchers, was bringing boatloads of fish back each evening, and Dr Dionisius Agius, from the Department of Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Leeds. Agius' role was to talk to local people in the hope that an oral tradition would have recorded what the scant written records had not. Agius is an expert on dhows, medieval fishing boats still used in some parts of the Gulf and in Africa today. </p> <p>Qalhat was a trading port; ships travelled down the Gulf coast and set sail from Qalhat to India. The Omanis exported horses and imported silk and spices, which were then conveyed across the mainland on donkeys and camels. </p> <p>The first written record referring to Qalhat is by Pliny in 70 AD; later Marco Polo wrote about it and in 1330, the traveller Ibn Battuta. Battuta arrived at the city in a state of exhaustion (having been taken on a detour with his devious guide, who managed to divest him of most of his clothes). \"My feet had become so swollen in my shoes that the blood was almost starting under the nails,\" he complained, adding that he was unable to walk for six days. He did, however, manage to describe the bazaars of Qalhat and a beautiful mosque covered with mosaic tiles. </p> <p>Vosmer's team surveyed the desert surrounding Qalhat in 45 C heat, strapped a camera on a kite to take aerial photos and searched for artefacts under water. </p> <p>They discovered a number of strangely shaped stone anchors, many like balls with holes drilled in them. They also found fragments of pottery and shards of iron. Many pieces of the ceramics were coated in a rare Chinese blue underglaze. The technique was developed during the 14th century by adding cobalt or copper pigment to the porcelain and covering the vessel in a transparent glaze to produce a vivid design in one firing. </p> <p> Other pieces were Persian in origin (Qalhat was controlled by Persia from the 15th to the 16th century) and from the Far East. In the ruined city they uncovered scraps of tiles from what had once been a mosque which matched Ibn Battuta's description. </p> <p>Agius, meanwhile, talked to ship captains, storytellers and boat builders from new Qalhat, a modern town up the coast. What he discovered was that old Qalhat had been devastated by an earthquake after the Portuguese had laid waste to it and had never recovered. There are no written references to an earthquake, but the local people were adamant that it had happened. In addition, by talking to fishermen who used them until the 1950s, he was able to convince Vosmer that the anchors were not for boats, but for nets. Several anchors were tied to each net; depending on the number and weight and length of their attachments, the net would float at a different level in the sea and trap a different species of fish. </p> <p>According to the ship builders, the dhows of Qalhat are still constructed in the old way: Indians from Kerala make them out of 'junglee' - Malabar jungle wood or teak.

      "bodyText": "'Allah take care of the crew on board; let angels surround the dhow. May Allah bring them back home safe to the beloved waiting afar.\" So sang an Omani sailor in a prayer for Dionisius Agius. Thirty kilometres north of Sur in south-east Oman you can look down from the hills to the ruins of a once mighty city which faces the sea, the port of Qalhat with its shattered towers, fallen houses and narrow winding streets. Qalhat was prosperous until 1508 when it was devastated by the Portuguese. Dr Tom Vosmer, from the Australian Maritime Museum in Freemantle, Australia, organised a team of archeologists to explore Qalhat. He was aided by the Omani Navy, whose most successful contribution, according to the researchers, was bringing boatloads of fish back each evening, and Dr Dionisius Agius, from the Department of Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Leeds. Agius' role was to talk to local people in the hope that an oral tradition would have recorded what the scant written records had not. Agius is an expert on dhows, medieval fishing boats still used in some parts of the Gulf and in Africa today. Qalhat was a trading port; ships travelled down the Gulf coast and set sail from Qalhat to India. The Omanis exported horses and imported silk and spices, which were then conveyed across the mainland on donkeys and camels. The first written record referring to Qalhat is by Pliny in 70 AD; later Marco Polo wrote about it and in 1330, the traveller Ibn Battuta. Battuta arrived at the city in a state of exhaustion (having been taken on a detour with his devious guide, who managed to divest him of most of his clothes). \"My feet had become so swollen in my shoes that the blood was almost starting under the nails,\" he complained, adding that he was unable to walk for six days. He did, however, manage to describe the bazaars of Qalhat and a beautiful mosque covered with mosaic tiles. Vosmer's team surveyed the desert surrounding Qalhat in 45 C heat, strapped a camera on a kite to take aerial photos and searched for artefacts under water. They discovered a number of strangely shaped stone anchors, many like balls with holes drilled in them. They also found fragments of pottery and shards of iron. Many pieces of the ceramics were coated in a rare Chinese blue underglaze. The technique was developed during the 14th century by adding cobalt or copper pigment to the porcelain and covering the vessel in a transparent glaze to produce a vivid design in one firing. Other pieces were Persian in origin (Qalhat was controlled by Persia from the 15th to the 16th century) and from the Far East. In the ruined city they uncovered scraps of tiles from what had once been a mosque which matched Ibn Battuta's description. Agius, meanwhile, talked to ship captains, storytellers and boat builders from new Qalhat, a modern town up the coast. What he discovered was that old Qalhat had been devastated by an earthquake after the Portuguese had laid waste to it and had never recovered. There are no written references to an earthquake, but the local people were adamant that it had happened. In addition, by talking to fishermen who used them until the 1950s, he was able to convince Vosmer that the anchors were not for boats, but for nets. Several anchors were tied to each net; depending on the number and weight and length of their attachments, the net would float at a different level in the sea and trap a different species of fish. According to the ship builders, the dhows of Qalhat are still constructed in the old way: Indians from Kerala make them out of 'junglee' - Malabar jungle wood or teak. Each ship is unique, because no measurements are made. Cotton padding is wedged between the planks and long iron nails wrapped in cotton thread and soaked in shark oil hold the ship together. The romantic notion that these ships are fast, reliable, efficient, and that the sailors sail by the light of the stars is unfortunately untrue. Many skippers who navigate without modern technology run aground, and those who can afford to, import swifter dhows from Japan. The team found some remains of boats, but none from the period they were interested in. According to Vosmer, this was due to the high salinity of the water and the abundance of teredo worms which eat wood. The team made their own anchor like those they had discovered but it broke on the sea bottom when they tested it. Agius suffered similar bad luck when a freak wind blew away his field notes. The Omanis were convinced it was the work of jinns (genies) - spirits who are neither angels nor devils but can be good or evil - and burned frankincense and myrrh to drive them away. But Vosmer is undaunted by the setbacks. \"The potential importance of the underwater site to Oman and to the history of ancient shipbuilding can't be over-emphasised.\" He's campaigning to create a protected zone around the city of Qalhat in the hope that its green waters and baking desert sands will one day release more information about the port's turbulent history.",

An amazing career that spans two decades. Six-time consecutive Pole Vaulting World Champion. Holder of 35 World Records (17 outdoor, 18 indoor).\" Just in case the message hasn't quite got through, the instructions begin with a section eulogising the althlete's (admittedly impressive) achievements all over again. By now, I'm convinced I want to buy Sergei Bubka. But what about his game? </p> <p>Actually, \"his\" game is overstating the case. Apart from the deification in the literature and a mugshot on the menu, the Ukrainian high flyer does not feature at all. </p> <p>True, the pole vault is one of the 19 events in this athletics sim (albeit one for which there is no tutorial). The other 18 are standard track-and-field stuff: hurdles, throws, jumps, sprints and long-distance running. </p> <p>Where this differs from its competitors is its MDP (mouse-driven power) system. This involves a rotating ring below the athlete with a fixed marker on its inner circumference. The object is to keep to the mouse button depressed while the green section of the disc passes beneath the marker, and to release it when it gets to red. This seems simple enough, and makes a half-decent stab at modelling athletic action. </p> <p>In practice, though, it is a strain to have to focus on a spinning disc, especially in the longer events. And when you are concentrating on a space just below the athlete's feet, you tend to miss out on other things - like where the no-throw line is, or what your athlete looks like. Fortunately for those with fewer than six eyes, a button-bashing mode is also available. </p> <p>On the subject of looks, the graphics are smooth enough, but far from detailed, and with a slightly washed-out feel. The crowd sounds, meanwhile, seem to have been lifted from a cockfight instead of an athletics stadium. </p> <p>If the events themselves are less than thrilling, the campaign modes are a fun addition. You can, if you choose, attempt to train an entire national team, with the aim of bringing home as many medals as possible. </p> <p>The more rewarding option is the decathlete trainer mode, in which you guide a young sports star through training, injuries and successively bigger competitions towards the ultimate goal of Olympic gold. </p> <p>Enjoyable as this is, it still entails mastering the individual events. Which, given the annoyingly vague tutorials and the blink-and-you'll-muff-it control system, is a tall order. If you do ever win a medal, you deserve one. (AB)</p> <p> <strong> Shameless cash-in lacks punch</strong></p> <p><strong> X-Men</strong> <br>Sony PlayStation \u00a329.99 Activision ** <br> Back in the good old days, when games came on tapes and keyboards dressed in rubber, all manner of movie licences were hastily ported on to the dominant genres of the day. </p> <p>Robocop was a side scrolling platform game, while Indiana Jones offered similar thrills. Batman? Well, rest assured, there were plenty of ledges to reach. </p> <p>In short, movie licences quickly became known as a shortcut to an unimaginative, lazy and pointless game. </p> <p>Unfortunately, in the 21st century things have got little better. With the exception of Goldeneye, film-licensed games are still struggling to reach mediocrity. Remember Phantom Menace? </p> <p>However, the just released X-Men movie, with its freakish set of characters, seemed to offer the basis for a cracking game. So, what do we get?

      "bodyText": "Pole vault champion trips up Sergei Bubka's Millennium Games PC CD-Rom \u00a324.99 Dinamic/Midas ** Interactive The box lid of Millennium Games lists Sergei Bubka's selling points: \"Unrivalled world champion. An amazing career that spans two decades. Six-time consecutive Pole Vaulting World Champion. Holder of 35 World Records (17 outdoor, 18 indoor).\" Just in case the message hasn't quite got through, the instructions begin with a section eulogising the althlete's (admittedly impressive) achievements all over again. By now, I'm convinced I want to buy Sergei Bubka. But what about his game? Actually, \"his\" game is overstating the case. Apart from the deification in the literature and a mugshot on the menu, the Ukrainian high flyer does not feature at all. True, the pole vault is one of the 19 events in this athletics sim (albeit one for which there is no tutorial). The other 18 are standard track-and-field stuff: hurdles, throws, jumps, sprints and long-distance running. Where this differs from its competitors is its MDP (mouse-driven power) system. This involves a rotating ring below the athlete with a fixed marker on its inner circumference. The object is to keep to the mouse button depressed while the green section of the disc passes beneath the marker, and to release it when it gets to red. This seems simple enough, and makes a half-decent stab at modelling athletic action. In practice, though, it is a strain to have to focus on a spinning disc, especially in the longer events. And when you are concentrating on a space just below the athlete's feet, you tend to miss out on other things - like where the no-throw line is, or what your athlete looks like. Fortunately for those with fewer than six eyes, a button-bashing mode is also available. On the subject of looks, the graphics are smooth enough, but far from detailed, and with a slightly washed-out feel. The crowd sounds, meanwhile, seem to have been lifted from a cockfight instead of an athletics stadium. If the events themselves are less than thrilling, the campaign modes are a fun addition. You can, if you choose, attempt to train an entire national team, with the aim of bringing home as many medals as possible. The more rewarding option is the decathlete trainer mode, in which you guide a young sports star through training, injuries and successively bigger competitions towards the ultimate goal of Olympic gold. Enjoyable as this is, it still entails mastering the individual events. Which, given the annoyingly vague tutorials and the blink-and-you'll-muff-it control system, is a tall order. If you do ever win a medal, you deserve one. (AB) Shameless cash-in lacks punch X-Men Sony PlayStation \u00a329.99 Activision ** Back in the good old days, when games came on tapes and keyboards dressed in rubber, all manner of movie licences were hastily ported on to the dominant genres of the day. Robocop was a side scrolling platform game, while Indiana Jones offered similar thrills. Batman? Well, rest assured, there were plenty of ledges to reach. In short, movie licences quickly became known as a shortcut to an unimaginative, lazy and pointless game. Unfortunately, in the 21st century things have got little better. With the exception of Goldeneye, film-licensed games are still struggling to reach mediocrity. Remember Phantom Menace? However, the just released X-Men movie, with its freakish set of characters, seemed to offer the basis for a cracking game. So, what do we get? Certainly not a stylish adventure epic. X-Men is, in fact, a fighting game - and a bog standard one at that. Graphics? Fine. Sound? Adequate. Originality? Snore, er pardon? X-Men shamelessly filches Street Fighter's feel and ridiculous special moves before adding some Tekken character design. And, if you have always suspected that beat-'em-up games are hollow exercises in button-bashing, then look here for confirmation. Extensive blindfold testing has revealed that random finger gymnastics are often as successful as a more studied approach. Anyhow, with rewards including movie clips and comic photos, you would have to be a real fan to want to practise this one. Despite the inclusion of 10 X-Men characters, comically pummelling each other in front of some authentic movie backdrops, this is uninspiring fare. Shamelessly derivative, and with a pungent whiff of cash-in, X-Men is yet another film-licensed disappointment.

Using the service is so simple, even the most tech-terrified could do it. Instructions - in a real human voice, rather than anything scary and automated - are clear and repeated often frequently. It understood my British accent without a glitch and in less than two minutes I had narrowed my restaurant search to 10 Vietnamese eateries in the area I wanted. I heard a couple of reviews, with gradings for service, decor and food, and when I had picked one, Tellme connected me directly to it, so I could book there and then. The ads were unobtrusive (though this could change as the service expands) and it only asked me, grovelling apologetically, to repeat myself once. </p> <p>Others - I tried four more - were also generally easy, though, as you would expect during a roll-out period, the information available varied. Audiopoint, which allows you to customise its service, gave quick, and surprisingly comprehensive, information on current travel problems in my area. BeVocal was the exception: after it had asked me four times at the start for my phone number (\"I did not understand you\"), I hung up in irritation. </p> <p>Simplicity is, in fact, the selling point of voice portals, perhaps because people have less patience on the phone than at their terminals: \"I wanted to build something that my mom would use,\" says Michael McCue, Tellme's chief executive.

      "body": "<p><strong> Four score</strong><br> Intel was scheduled to announce a top-of-the-range Pentium 4 processor at its Developer Forum Conference in San Jose, California, this week. The new chip, codenamed Willamette, has a new architecture, called NetBurst, which is supposed to provide better performance with applications such as audio and video streaming over the internet. It also has a 400MHz system bus, which compares with 200MHz on current AMD Athlon processors and 133MHz on the Pentium III. A 1.4GHz Pentium 4 is expected to appear towards the end of this year, initially in high-priced workstations. </p> <p>Intel is also expected to announce two new versions of its StrongArm chip, based on an Acorn design. StrongArm processors are intended for use in handheld organisers, mobile phones and similar non-PC devices. </p> <p><strong> Internet for dummies</strong><br> In the US, Compaq has finally launched its iPaq Home Internet Appliance, complete with 10in LCD screen, which was promised at the Comdex computer trade show in Las Vegas last November. Like Microsoft's venerable WebTV, the HIA is designed to get novice users on to the internet without them having to cope with the complexities of a personal computer. However, Compaq's device only works with the MSN (Microsoft Network) connection, and sales outside the US will depend on signing deals with internet service providers. ISPs will supply the $599 machine either free or at a hefty discount as part of an online package. For example, the price falls to $199 if you buy a three-year subscription to the MSN internet service <a href=\"http://athome.compaq.com/showroom/static/ipaq/intappliance.asp\" target=\"_new\">http://athome.compaq.com/showroom/static/ipaq/intappliance.asp</a>. </p> <p>There are already several \"internet appliances\" on the US market, including Netpliance's i-Opener. Several other companies are also planning to produce \"MSN companions\" similar to Compaq's, including Acer, eMachines, Philips, Thomson Multimedia and Vestal USA. America Online (AOL) is also working with Gateway to develop a similar appliance for AOL users, and Compaq is expected to produce another version of its iPaq device running Be Inc's BeOS operating system instead of Microsoft's Windows CE. </p> <p><strong> Palm springs</strong><br> Agenda Computing, based in California, plans to ship a palmtop computer that runs the Linux VR operating system in October. However, it is not designed just for geeks: it has a friendly graphical front-end like the Palm's, to shield users from the complex Unix-like operating system underneath. The Agenda VR3 has a 2.25in by 3.25in monochrome screen and weighs four ounces. It is powered by a 66MHz Mips 32-bit processor. Agenda plans to ship the VR3 model, with 8MB of memory and 2MB of Flash storage for $145. VR3+ and VR3s models will offer more Flash memory for storage, and a VR5 is expected by the end of the year. Optional accessories include a keyboard and a 33.6kbps modem. Agenda is taking orders on its website at <a href=\"http://www.agendacomputing.com/products/pre_reg.jsp\">www.agendacomputing.com/products/pre_reg.jsp</a>. (JS) </p> <p><strong> Mission possible if you make it snappy</strong><br> For five years digital camera manufacturers have been trying every trick in the book to persuade us to buy their models. </p> <p>This year they called in their secret weapon - Tom Cruise. Apparently, the sight of the diminutive action hero touting a Kodak model and getting hot under the collar about the whereabouts of a CompactFlash card in Mission: Impossible 2 has caused sales of digital cameras to rocket in the US. Sales are also up in the UK. </p> <p>Cruise's all-action intervention is actually very nicely timed. At the high-end, models have reached the point where they deliver very detailed pictures indeed, while in the budget sector brightly coloured simple-to-use cameras are on the verge of bringing digital photography to the masses. </p> <p>Prices have also dropped and the \u00a3100 barrier has been breached by one of the best-known companies in photography - Kodak. </p> <p>The big talk in digital camera circles at the moment is about the number of pixels each camera's CCD is capable of capturing - the greater the number of pixels in an image, the more detailed it is. </p> <p>Earlier this year, a host of makers rolled out three megapixel cameras. These models will be usurped by a range of four megapixel models that will be in the stores between now and Christmas. </p> <p>Improving creative and manual controls is also a priority, as is upping the gadget factor (video clips, built-in MP3 players and so on). The zooms on high-end models are also becoming more powerful. </p> <p>With the pivotal Photokina exhibition in Cologne, Germany, less than a month away, the big names have started to unveil their new product for this and next year. </p> <p>First off the blocks was Olympus, who this week announced the November launch of the \u00a31,500 Camedia E-10, which it claims is the World's first ever four megapixel camera. In addition to its high resolution, it boasts a 4x zoom, one of the brightest lenses on the market, storage slots for both SmartMedia and CompactFlash cards and a host of manual and creative controls. </p> <p>Also due in November is the \u00a31,299 Olympus E-100RS. This 1.5 megapixel camera's unique feature is the ability to capture up to 15 images per second - great news for those perfecting their golf swing. It also sports a 10x power zoom and 2x7 digital zoom, an image stabilisation system, and can capture up to four seconds of video with sound. </p> <p>Fuji is also targeting the enthusiast end of the market with its new camera, the Finepix 4900 Zoom. Due out next month, the model sports a 2.3 mega pixel CCD and a powerful 6x zoom. </p> <p>At the opposite end of the market, Samsung has high hopes for its just launched \u00a3250 SDC-80. This 850 pixel model comes in four fruity translucent finishes, including orange, apple green, blueberry blue and white. Other facilities include a 1.8inch mini LCD screen, a pop-up flash and a 4MB SmartMedia card to store the images on. </p> <p>Samsung has also become the second manufacturer to deliver a digital camera with a built-in MP3 player (Fuji got there first). The tiny \u00a3230 Digimax 35 Plus comes with a 32MB CompactFlash card which can archive around half an hour's worth of music. </p> <p>Kodak is expected to announce three new cameras in the next week that will go on sale in autumn. Top billing goes to a budget model that features a video clip facility and a USB port, yet sells for less than \u00a3100. </p> <p>Out in the US, and expected here very shortly, is the \u00a3400 Kodak DC3400. Pitched at the slightly more ambitious novice, the camera uses a two-million pixel CCD and features a 2x zoom. </p> <p>Other manufacturers, including Nikon, Pentax and Sony, will announce new models in the next few weeks.

However, Compaq's device only works with the MSN (Microsoft Network) connection, and sales outside the US will depend on signing deals with internet service providers. ISPs will supply the $599 machine either free or at a hefty discount as part of an online package. For example, the price falls to $199 if you buy a three-year subscription to the MSN internet service http://athome.compaq.com/showroom/static/ipaq/intappliance.asp. There are already several \"internet appliances\" on the US market, including Netpliance's i-Opener. Several other companies are also planning to produce \"MSN companions\" similar to Compaq's, including Acer, eMachines, Philips, Thomson Multimedia and Vestal USA. America Online (AOL) is also working with Gateway to develop a similar appliance for AOL users, and Compaq is expected to produce another version of its iPaq device running Be Inc's BeOS operating system instead of Microsoft's Windows CE. Palm springs Agenda Computing, based in California, plans to ship a palmtop computer that runs the Linux VR operating system in October. However, it is not designed just for geeks: it has a friendly graphical front-end like the Palm's, to shield users from the complex Unix-like operating system underneath. The Agenda VR3 has a 2.25in by 3.25in monochrome screen and weighs four ounces. It is powered by a 66MHz Mips 32-bit processor. Agenda plans to ship the VR3 model, with 8MB of memory and 2MB of Flash storage for $145. VR3+ and VR3s models will offer more Flash memory for storage, and a VR5 is expected by the end of the year. Optional accessories include a keyboard and a 33.6kbps modem. Agenda is taking orders on its website at www.agendacomputing.com/products/pre_reg.jsp. (JS) Mission possible if you make it snappy For five years digital camera manufacturers have been trying every trick in the book to persuade us to buy their models. This year they called in their secret weapon - Tom Cruise. Apparently, the sight of the diminutive action hero touting a Kodak model and getting hot under the collar about the whereabouts of a CompactFlash card in Mission: Impossible 2 has caused sales of digital cameras to rocket in the US. Sales are also up in the UK. Cruise's all-action intervention is actually very nicely timed. At the high-end, models have reached the point where they deliver very detailed pictures indeed, while in the budget sector brightly coloured simple-to-use cameras are on the verge of bringing digital photography to the masses. Prices have also dropped and the \u00a3100 barrier has been breached by one of the best-known companies in photography - Kodak. The big talk in digital camera circles at the moment is about the number of pixels each camera's CCD is capable of capturing - the greater the number of pixels in an image, the more detailed it is. Earlier this year, a host of makers rolled out three megapixel cameras. These models will be usurped by a range of four megapixel models that will be in the stores between now and Christmas. Improving creative and manual controls is also a priority, as is upping the gadget factor (video clips, built-in MP3 players and so on). The zooms on high-end models are also becoming more powerful. With the pivotal Photokina exhibition in Cologne, Germany, less than a month away, the big names have started to unveil their new product for this and next year. First off the blocks was Olympus, who this week announced the November launch of the \u00a31,500 Camedia E-10, which it claims is the World's first ever four megapixel camera. In addition to its high resolution, it boasts a 4x zoom, one of the brightest lenses on the market, storage slots for both SmartMedia and CompactFlash cards and a host of manual and creative controls. Also due in November is the \u00a31,299 Olympus E-100RS. This 1.5 megapixel camera's unique feature is the ability to capture up to 15 images per second - great news for those perfecting their golf swing. It also sports a 10x power zoom and 2x7 digital zoom, an image stabilisation system, and can capture up to four seconds of video with sound. Fuji is also targeting the enthusiast end of the market with its new camera, the Finepix 4900 Zoom. Due out next month, the model sports a 2.3 mega pixel CCD and a powerful 6x zoom. At the opposite end of the market, Samsung has high hopes for its just launched \u00a3250 SDC-80. This 850 pixel model comes in four fruity translucent finishes, including orange, apple green, blueberry blue and white. Other facilities include a 1.8inch mini LCD screen, a pop-up flash and a 4MB SmartMedia card to store the images on. Samsung has also become the second manufacturer to deliver a digital camera with a built-in MP3 player (Fuji got there first). The tiny \u00a3230 Digimax 35 Plus comes with a 32MB CompactFlash card which can archive around half an hour's worth of music. Kodak is expected to announce three new cameras in the next week that will go on sale in autumn. Top billing goes to a budget model that features a video clip facility and a USB port, yet sells for less than \u00a3100. Out in the US, and expected here very shortly, is the \u00a3400 Kodak DC3400. Pitched at the slightly more ambitious novice, the camera uses a two-million pixel CCD and features a 2x zoom. Other manufacturers, including Nikon, Pentax and Sony, will announce new models in the next few weeks. (AN)",

      "body": "<p>Liverpudlian artist Kathryn Williams is among the nominees for this year's Mercury music prize - and hotly tipped to win. Last year Kate Rusby was nominated for the prestigious award, and in 1998 Eliza Carthy was on the list. This trio of young women (Carthy is 24, Williams and Rusby are 26) are redefining folk, roots and acoustic music, countering the prevailing image of women in folk as meek, mild and a cappella. They are not like Enya or the Corrs, splashing uillean pipes over what is essentially airbrushed pop. They are part of a new generation that is rooted in the scene, yet incorporating their own elements and making a wider impact. </p> <p>Carthy has electric-blue hair, several piercings, a wayward fiddle, and feels as happy in the dance tent at Glastonbury as she does in the festival's folky Avalon Field. Her 1998 album Red Rice fused traditional English song with reggae and dub beats, honky tonk piano and electronic strings. \"I'm incredibly proud of it,\" she declares today. \"Not only is it a good folk record, but it's a challenging one as well.\" The daughter of folk legends Martin Carthy and Norma Waterson, she was born in Yorkshire and bred into folk music, singing on stage with her parents from an early age. She never subscribed to the view that women in folk should be winsome and sweet. \"People still think that's a good way to perform. I'm not into that personally. I like blood and guts in my music.\" </p> <p>Carthy brings a robust, streetwise quality to the genre, something that attracts younger fans in particular. \"She's keeping English traditional music alive, while introducing it to a new audience,\" says her manager, Nigel Morton. \"Her hair and piercings are most untraditional folk fashion, and there are a lot of girls at her gigs who look the same and have the same attitude.\" Carthy, he says, represents the \"real thing\", whereas the Corrs \"are doing more damage to this music than good. They make it saccharine.\" </p> <p>But with Carthy recently signed to major label Warner Brothers, will she be pressured to dilute her style? Her new self-penned album Angels and Cigarettes includes a 25-piece string section, ambient beats and a trip-hop version of Paul Weller's Wildwood. There are folk references, but it is a far cry from Red Rice. She sighs. \"I felt I wanted to have a change. I left school at 17 and went on the road until I signed to Warners. I hadn't had a holiday, I was always working. I wanted to take a step back. I still love traditional music, but I wanted a change from it being my main bread and butter.\" She freely admits that this album is more pop than folk. \"It's just a collection of songs about being in love and being pissed off. I had fun doing it. I feel I'm in a totally different arena.\" </p> <p>She still perfoms regularly with her parents' band, Waterson:Carthy, and considers that sacrosanct. \"The label can't influence that: it's in my contract.\" She is aware of people at Warners with \"different tastes\" and is prepared to compromise up to a point, but \"they have to respect that I know what I'm doing. We stare at each other across a table until one of us blinks.\" </p> <p>By contrast, Kathryn Williams (\"I play the folk circuit but I wouldn't say I'm a folk artist\") remains resolutely independent. Her first album, 1999's Dog Leap Stairs, cost \u00a380 to record and was released on her own label, Caw. The follow-up, this year's Mercury-nominated Little Black Numbers, was made for \u00a33,000. \"It might not sound a lot,\" she says, \"but it felt like a lot to me.\" Her barbed, fragile acoustic songs have a fanatical following, but Williams is wary of the major labels hammering at her door and of taking a more commercial route. \"Major labels are just too keen on polishing or cleaning up your music,\" she said recently. Nick Evans, A&amp;R for Elemental Records, reports wryly that \"she refuses to deal with anyone from the music business. Thinks we're all cunts.\" </p> <p>It is that fierceness and commitment that marks out this new breed of female folk artists. Barnsley-born Kate Rusby has been reworking traditions since 1997, running the aptly named cottage-industry label Pure Records with her family, and making a modest fortune in the process. Her debut album, Hourglass, has sold 30,000 copies, while 1999's Sleepless has clocked up sales of over 60,000. She sings ancient unadorned ballads, yet people come to her gigs saying: \"I hate folk music, but I love you!\" </p> <p>There is a clarity and warmth in her singing that appeals across genres. \"The songs I love break my heart,\" she says frankly. \"Some old love ballads are 120 verses long. It's like reading a novel: I see it all going off in my head. I picture the heartbreak and the pain.\" </p> <p>Her parents had their own ceilidh band, and her father worked as a sound engineer, so Rusby was hiked around folk festivals from the age of three. At 15, she sang on the festival circuit while her friends went out clubbing. \"I tried out a few discos, but the music didn't appeal. People say songs written 100 years ago are not relevant, but to me it's all about emotions. People are still falling in love and leaving people, and folk expresses those passion,\" she enthuses. </p> <p>Rusby collects old songs and updates them with modern arrangements or new tunes. This offends the purists. \"Other people say: 'How dare she come along and change it?' But folk has to change with each generation. The original 60s folk revival was my parents' generation. They've all had kids; we all turned 18-20 at the same time, and were looking for work.\" </p> <p>Each artist in the acoustic scene brings something new to the mix: Rosie Brown blends folk, jazz and torch song, while Rebecca Hollweg laces her low-key arrangements with exquisite vocals and Carina Round offers stark songs of love and hate. Though life is more comfortable on a major label, Carthy feels it is important to remain grounded in an alternative scene, to preserve \"an intelligent, thoughtful voice. It is easy to let the world wash over you because you've got a house filled with Ikea. There is still room for troubadours who can walk into a pub and sing about what's going on. Those boy/girl pop bands, they're like cabaret performers. It's not heart music, not blood music. It's all pretend.\" </p> <p>Carthy is one of many female performers who have found folk music empowering. Holly Lerski of East Anglian folk-pop outfit Angelou used it as a starting point to explore her songwriting. \"The song tradition - passing stories down to the next generation - is a form of people power,\" she asserts. \"Though romanticism has clouded the way a bit, and there's a small Luddite/WASP contingency who hark back to the good ol' days of the plough and the wife by the stove, I think folk music is a very open, inclusive scene. Which is probably why more women musicians are finding it such a good place to flourish.\" </p> <p>Eliza Carthy's Angels and Cigarettes will be released on September 18.

      "bodyText": "Liverpudlian artist Kathryn Williams is among the nominees for this year's Mercury music prize - and hotly tipped to win. Last year Kate Rusby was nominated for the prestigious award, and in 1998 Eliza Carthy was on the list. This trio of young women (Carthy is 24, Williams and Rusby are 26) are redefining folk, roots and acoustic music, countering the prevailing image of women in folk as meek, mild and a cappella. They are not like Enya or the Corrs, splashing uillean pipes over what is essentially airbrushed pop. They are part of a new generation that is rooted in the scene, yet incorporating their own elements and making a wider impact. Carthy has electric-blue hair, several piercings, a wayward fiddle, and feels as happy in the dance tent at Glastonbury as she does in the festival's folky Avalon Field. Her 1998 album Red Rice fused traditional English song with reggae and dub beats, honky tonk piano and electronic strings. \"I'm incredibly proud of it,\" she declares today. \"Not only is it a good folk record, but it's a challenging one as well.\" The daughter of folk legends Martin Carthy and Norma Waterson, she was born in Yorkshire and bred into folk music, singing on stage with her parents from an early age. She never subscribed to the view that women in folk should be winsome and sweet. \"People still think that's a good way to perform. I'm not into that personally. I like blood and guts in my music.\" Carthy brings a robust, streetwise quality to the genre, something that attracts younger fans in particular. \"She's keeping English traditional music alive, while introducing it to a new audience,\" says her manager, Nigel Morton. \"Her hair and piercings are most untraditional folk fashion, and there are a lot of girls at her gigs who look the same and have the same attitude.\" Carthy, he says, represents the \"real thing\", whereas the Corrs \"are doing more damage to this music than good. They make it saccharine.\" But with Carthy recently signed to major label Warner Brothers, will she be pressured to dilute her style? Her new self-penned album Angels and Cigarettes includes a 25-piece string section, ambient beats and a trip-hop version of Paul Weller's Wildwood. There are folk references, but it is a far cry from Red Rice. She sighs. \"I felt I wanted to have a change. I left school at 17 and went on the road until I signed to Warners. I hadn't had a holiday, I was always working. I wanted to take a step back. I still love traditional music, but I wanted a change from it being my main bread and butter.\" She freely admits that this album is more pop than folk. \"It's just a collection of songs about being in love and being pissed off.
