He also strongly defended the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, from accusations of advocating policies to benefit his paid consultancy with a US oil company. He said no MP or journalist believed that his consultancy with oil company Kerr McGee, \"which did not own a single petrol station\" benefited from Tory policies advocating cuts in petrol prices. The committee is examining tighter rules forcing MPs to declare fees and contracts for outside speaking engagements and insisting that employment contracts are deposited in parliament revealing exactly how much money they receive. Mr Clarke, who opposes this, told the committee: \"MPs are entitled to the same level of privacy that other citizens are entitled to expect in their activities outside parliament.\" He added: \"We do appear to be racing towards the American position, whereby individual tax returns and health records are made freely available to the public.\" Later Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general in Mr Major's government, called for one aspect of the rules to be tightened up - a proposal to exempt declarations of hospitality from regional quangos and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments.",

Les Echos in France has reprinted it, Die Zeit in Germany follows. Latin America and parts of Asia are espousing third way political language too. Hardly surprising since it is the perfect vehicle in which troubled traditional socialist parties can drive away from a failing past into a more inclusive centre-left future. It is the ideal political portmanteau for our times - flexible, agile, chameleon. (Astonishingly, the Washington Post reports that even George Bush was toying with using it himself.)</p> <p>But for a Labour party that has already made the long march centrewards, the third way is now utterly redundant. Worse, it muddies the waters, hides its light under a bushel. What Tony Blair calls his \"Third Way, Phase Two\" is a useless road map for present policy and an even vaguer guide to future intent. Inside the Downing Street thinkery they say they are searching for a \"narrative\", the missing red thread to guide them through this thicket of policy. That is only half true. Sometimes they want a narrative but sometimes they prefer muddy water. As soon as a policy threatens to define them, they rush out a counter-policy to confuse. The third way is an escape from self-definition - a butterfly always on the wing.</p> <p>No wonder every politician everywhere reaches for it: the third way temptingly offers the best of all possible worlds. It means never having to choose, all the old lions and lambs happily snuggling down together. Successful business goes hand in hand with caring social objectives, dynamic markets embrace strong social communities. With felicitously crafted language, all goals can become mutually dependent, never competing. So the values of Europe, \" fairness, solidarity\" can combine with \"the economic dynamism traditionally associated with the US\". (No mention of the stark choice these societies make in tax rates, with concomitant very different results). Toughness on crime never works without tackling its causes, he says - punishment and pity side by side. (No contradiction between tabloid-pleasing and what works.) Decentralising power can cohabit with uniform standards. (No tug-of-war between local choice and national benchmark.) Reversing national decline and improving productivity can be done with green sustainable development. Yes, the third way offers all this, with no awkward choices.</p> <p>Those who shuddered a bit on hearing a Labour prime minister declare on television, in Camp David casual wear, that he and Dubya had many \"shared values\", might rightly wonder what they are. Oil, guns, missiles, electric chairs . . . Even allowing for realpolitik, straddling the Atlantic will get harder if obedient bombing of Iraq against the rest of world opinion is the price of a relationship greatly less special since Clinton's departure. Europe will tug harder in the other direction: Blair assurances may be blown apart over NMD.</p> <p>Curiously, the government does not always live up to third way flexibility. Mark this extract from the Blair text: The third way \"does not (his italics) stand for rigid forms of state ownership or provision. It is pragmatic as to whether public or private means are the best delivery mechanism\". Robert Kiley, the New Yorker at the end of his tether bargaining with the Treasury over control of London Underground, finds an ideological obduracy that makes Mrs Thatcher look pliable. Now even the Tories have abandoned tube privatisation, yet this PPP is still being imposed relentlessly, a long-term political disaster saster. (Financial risk is not really transferred to the private sector - but blame for every late train will be transferred to the Treasury.) Not pragmatism but dogmatism.</p> <p>Next week Tony Blair makes a key environment speech: it will be visionary stuff. But there will be just one substantial matter - a genuine test as a battle is fought out behind the scenes. He will announce new money for renewable energy - currently Britain will not meet its target 10% energy from renewable sources by 2010. Wind power is now almost at a competitive price - but it needs the same kick-start other countries give it.</p> <p>D enmark has stolen ahead in wind machine exports. Solar power is further from competitive price, but will be a winning technology. While Germany and Japan offer big solar subsidies, the US commissions a million subsidised solar roofs, but Britain is doing virtually nothing. It is like ignoring the early stages of the micro-chip. The Treasury is offering token sums for wind, nothing for solar - short-sighted and wrong-headed. Given the Blair essay's praise for new technology, if there is less than \u00a3500m for both technologies, his words will be empty: even that will not hit the 2010 target. In the end, there are always choices.</p> <p>Does it matter if this government has no better self-definition than third way evasions? It does well enough on the big issues - the economy, poverty, gradually improving public services. The election is already won. So why yearn for sharp edges? Because hazy feel-good language does not announce which way Labour will jump when the going gets tough. As yet untested, how will Labour respond when a threatening Conservative opposition eventually rears its head? In an economic downturn, we need to know what comes first - business and taxpayers or preserving the public sector? So far, buttering up business has meant choosing no legislation on work/life balance to ease the gross over-work burden on families. Yesterday it meant announcing no enforcement of equal pay for women. With the Treasury over-flowing, the long-term need for higher taxes is obscured, but there is a choice between low tax and high public service.</p> <p>This feeble third way language is too weak a light on the leader's helmet to shine the way. Odd that a government radical enough to promise an end to child poverty, unemployment and third world debt should so lack a resonant philosophy to encapsulate its own best qualities. It deserves a bolder legend. Bolder language might even stiffen its own nerve, as well as inspiring stronger allegiance. It is not easy to govern a modern fissiparous, pluralist and diverse society where each individual has multiple roles and contradictory interests. But that is all the more reason to plant a flag or two to rally round. It may not be cynicism but lack of tribal passion that is killing politics.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Sometimes they want a narrative but sometimes they prefer muddy water. As soon as a policy threatens to define them, they rush out a counter-policy to confuse. The third way is an escape from self-definition - a butterfly always on the wing. No wonder every politician everywhere reaches for it: the third way temptingly offers the best of all possible worlds. It means never having to choose, all the old lions and lambs happily snuggling down together. Successful business goes hand in hand with caring social objectives, dynamic markets embrace strong social communities. With felicitously crafted language, all goals can become mutually dependent, never competing. So the values of Europe, \" fairness, solidarity\" can combine with \"the economic dynamism traditionally associated with the US\". (No mention of the stark choice these societies make in tax rates, with concomitant very different results). Toughness on crime never works without tackling its causes, he says - punishment and pity side by side. (No contradiction between tabloid-pleasing and what works.) Decentralising power can cohabit with uniform standards. (No tug-of-war between local choice and national benchmark.) Reversing national decline and improving productivity can be done with green sustainable development. Yes, the third way offers all this, with no awkward choices. Those who shuddered a bit on hearing a Labour prime minister declare on television, in Camp David casual wear, that he and Dubya had many \"shared values\", might rightly wonder what they are. Oil, guns, missiles, electric chairs . . . Even allowing for realpolitik, straddling the Atlantic will get harder if obedient bombing of Iraq against the rest of world opinion is the price of a relationship greatly less special since Clinton's departure. Europe will tug harder in the other direction: Blair assurances may be blown apart over NMD. Curiously, the government does not always live up to third way flexibility. Mark this extract from the Blair text: The third way \"does not (his italics) stand for rigid forms of state ownership or provision. It is pragmatic as to whether public or private means are the best delivery mechanism\". Robert Kiley, the New Yorker at the end of his tether bargaining with the Treasury over control of London Underground, finds an ideological obduracy that makes Mrs Thatcher look pliable. Now even the Tories have abandoned tube privatisation, yet this PPP is still being imposed relentlessly, a long-term political disaster saster. (Financial risk is not really transferred to the private sector - but blame for every late train will be transferred to the Treasury.) Not pragmatism but dogmatism. Next week Tony Blair makes a key environment speech: it will be visionary stuff. But there will be just one substantial matter - a genuine test as a battle is fought out behind the scenes. He will announce new money for renewable energy - currently Britain will not meet its target 10% energy from renewable sources by 2010. Wind power is now almost at a competitive price - but it needs the same kick-start other countries give it. D enmark has stolen ahead in wind machine exports. Solar power is further from competitive price, but will be a winning technology. While Germany and Japan offer big solar subsidies, the US commissions a million subsidised solar roofs, but Britain is doing virtually nothing. It is like ignoring the early stages of the micro-chip. The Treasury is offering token sums for wind, nothing for solar - short-sighted and wrong-headed. Given the Blair essay's praise for new technology, if there is less than \u00a3500m for both technologies, his words will be empty: even that will not hit the 2010 target. In the end, there are always choices. Does it matter if this government has no better self-definition than third way evasions? It does well enough on the big issues - the economy, poverty, gradually improving public services. The election is already won. So why yearn for sharp edges? Because hazy feel-good language does not announce which way Labour will jump when the going gets tough. As yet untested, how will Labour respond when a threatening Conservative opposition eventually rears its head? In an economic downturn, we need to know what comes first - business and taxpayers or preserving the public sector? So far, buttering up business has meant choosing no legislation on work/life balance to ease the gross over-work burden on families. Yesterday it meant announcing no enforcement of equal pay for women. With the Treasury over-flowing, the long-term need for higher taxes is obscured, but there is a choice between low tax and high public service. This feeble third way language is too weak a light on the leader's helmet to shine the way. Odd that a government radical enough to promise an end to child poverty, unemployment and third world debt should so lack a resonant philosophy to encapsulate its own best qualities. It deserves a bolder legend. Bolder language might even stiffen its own nerve, as well as inspiring stronger allegiance. It is not easy to govern a modern fissiparous, pluralist and diverse society where each individual has multiple roles and contradictory interests. But that is all the more reason to plant a flag or two to rally round. It may not be cynicism but lack of tribal passion that is killing politics. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

Worse, it muddies the waters, hides its light under a bushel. What Tony Blair calls his \"Third Way, Phase Two\" is a useless road map for present policy and an even vaguer guide to future intent. Inside the Downing Street thinkery they say they are searching for a \"narrative\", the missing red thread to guide them through this thicket of policy. That is only half true. Sometimes they want a narrative but sometimes they prefer muddy water. As soon as a policy threatens to define them, they rush out a counter-policy to confuse. The third way is an escape from self-definition - a butterfly always on the wing.</p> <p>No wonder every politician everywhere reaches for it: the third way temptingly offers the best of all possible worlds. It means never having to choose, all the old lions and lambs happily snuggling down together. Successful business goes hand in hand with caring social objectives, dynamic markets embrace strong social communities. With felicitously crafted language, all goals can become mutually dependent, never competing.

      "bodyText": "William Hague will abandon Conservative plans to privatise the London Underground today, intensifying speculation that Michael Portillo is strengthening his grip on party policy - and pushing towards the centre ground. The announcement, leaked last night, prompted the Tory right to claim that Mr Hague is increasingly a prisoner of his shadow chancellor who is busily courting what remains of the party's leftwing at Westminster with a view to a post-election leadership contest. Faced with the deepening unpopularity of privatisation in the wake of Railtrack's problems, the Tories have decided to give their support to the alternative being proposed by Bob Kiley, the transport commissioner appointed by London's mayor, Ken Livingstone. The latest Tory u-turn comes as Tony Blair struggles to get Mr Kiley the overall manage ment control he seeks within the broad framework of John Prescott's public/private partnership for revitalising the long-neglected underground. Mr Kiley, an American whose smooth-talking popularity the Tories acknowledge, could be asked to chair a management board on which the three private firms running the underground will sit. \"We've got to give this man a fair wind,\" one Hague aide said last night. Within the Conservatives, the responsibility for junking the privatisation plan originally drawn up by John Redwood lies with the shadow environment secretary, Archie Norman, and his transport spokesman, Bernard Jenkin - though Mr Portillo and Mr Hague have endorsed it. The Redwood plan would have created park-and-ride schemes, competing underground lines, user-friendly stations and - in theory - given \u00a3750m back to the Treasury. Hague advisers said last night that \"events have moved on\" and that practical politics dictate that Mr Kiley deserves a chance.

Talk about a post-election leadership contest infuriates the Portillo camp, which says it is powerless to prevent people claiming to be \"friends of Michael\" spreading stories which they say are damaging both to him and to the authority of Mr Hague, already battered by polls which show him trailing up to 20% behind Labour under Tony Blair. \"There are no outriders licensed to speak for Michael,\" advisers said last night.

      "body": "<p>Is the government aware of the implications of its own legislation? This is not as naive a question as it sounds. For if education ministers find themselves short of bedtime reading in the next week or so, they might be well advised to acquire a copy of the Labour government's Human Rights Act, which came into force in October last year. I would recommend, specifically, that they study article 9, which guarantees freedom of thought, conscience and religion. And, when they have read it, the first paragraph may give them nightmares. </p> <p>The point is that, if we all have the right in law to these freedoms, it opens up the prospect of a legal challenge to the government's plan to expand the number of church secondary schools. These schools would, presumably, incorporate Anglican, Catholic or Muslim beliefs into the everyday running of the school, and require children - and their parents - to observe the rituals and customs of that faith. They might well, as some primary schools already do, require regular attendance at Christian services (or a mosque or a synagogue), as a condition of getting into the school. </p> <p>For parents who do not have religious beliefs, this poses a dilemma. If the only decent state secondary school in your area happens to be single-faith, do you pretend to convictions you don't have - and quite possibly find offensive - or jeopardise your children's education? I already have friends who are thinking seriously about starting to attend mass, even though they loathed their own Catholic upbringing, in order to get their children into a primary school with good results. This is particularly disturbing for mothers who are aware of the impact of the Vatican's entrenched misogyny on their own lives, and reluctant to expose their daughters to it. </p> <p>This is, in effect, a form of discrimination against secular parents and their families. What makes it even more astonishing, at the beginning of the 21st century, is that it is being proposed by the state. The government has no business promoting religion, and what it does not seem to have realised, when it signalled its intention to expand the number of single-faith schools earlier this month, is that parents now have recourse to the courts if they wish to avoid making either of these unacceptable choices. </p> <p>The first paragraph of article 9 reads in full: \"everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance\". It is abundantly clear that a child sent to a church school, where he or she is compelled to subscribe to a single faith as a condition of being there, is being denied the rights conferred by the Human Rights Act. </p> <p>This is not an argument that aspects of religion should not be taught in schools; unlike religious bigots, who despise atheists like myself - I have the letters to prove it - I am happy for it to be there, as an optional subject and taught in the context of cultural studies. That is what living in a plural society means: giving people, and that includes children, a choice about what they believe in. It does not mean, as happened to the children of some friends of mine in an Oxfordshire village, being sent home from school with instructions to write a letter to God. </p> <p>What I object to is children being indoctrinated in a single faith, at taxpayers' expense, and their parents forced to go along with it. This is no longer, as I have pointed out before, a Christian country, given that less than a million people, out of a population of 60m, attend Anglican services on Sundays. Even if it were, it is wrong in principle for state-funded schools to promote one religion over another, and to neglect other systems of thought, including humanism and atheism. </p> <p>I recognised this myself as a teenager, with comical results. Pointing out that I was not compelled by law to attend the parts of morning assembly that involved Christian worship, I declared that I would not in future take part in it. This caused consternation, though not because I was the first child in my state school in Hertfordshire to exercise this right. The others were girls from other religions, Catholics or observant Jews; what the school had not previously encountered was a conscientious objector who just wanted to read Jackie. </p> <p>What will happen to the next generation of 14-year-olds, packed off to Tony Blair's church secondary schools against their will? It is quite possible that some of them will decide that they don't want to attend mass or the local mosque; will the single-faith schools proposed in the green paper allow them to exercise freedom of conscience? </p> <p>It is fortunate that, in a society increasingly aware of the importance of universal human rights, an act now exists to protect them. The irony, that it is the creation of this peculiarly narrow-minded government, is almost too delicious to contemplate. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Is the government aware of the implications of its own legislation? This is not as naive a question as it sounds. For if education ministers find themselves short of bedtime reading in the next week or so, they might be well advised to acquire a copy of the Labour government's Human Rights Act, which came into force in October last year. I would recommend, specifically, that they study article 9, which guarantees freedom of thought, conscience and religion. And, when they have read it, the first paragraph may give them nightmares. The point is that, if we all have the right in law to these freedoms, it opens up the prospect of a legal challenge to the government's plan to expand the number of church secondary schools. These schools would, presumably, incorporate Anglican, Catholic or Muslim beliefs into the everyday running of the school, and require children - and their parents - to observe the rituals and customs of that faith. They might well, as some primary schools already do, require regular attendance at Christian services (or a mosque or a synagogue), as a condition of getting into the school. For parents who do not have religious beliefs, this poses a dilemma. If the only decent state secondary school in your area happens to be single-faith, do you pretend to convictions you don't have - and quite possibly find offensive - or jeopardise your children's education? I already have friends who are thinking seriously about starting to attend mass, even though they loathed their own Catholic upbringing, in order to get their children into a primary school with good results. This is particularly disturbing for mothers who are aware of the impact of the Vatican's entrenched misogyny on their own lives, and reluctant to expose their daughters to it. This is, in effect, a form of discrimination against secular parents and their families. What makes it even more astonishing, at the beginning of the 21st century, is that it is being proposed by the state. The government has no business promoting religion, and what it does not seem to have realised, when it signalled its intention to expand the number of single-faith schools earlier this month, is that parents now have recourse to the courts if they wish to avoid making either of these unacceptable choices. The first paragraph of article 9 reads in full: \"everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance\". It is abundantly clear that a child sent to a church school, where he or she is compelled to subscribe to a single faith as a condition of being there, is being denied the rights conferred by the Human Rights Act. This is not an argument that aspects of religion should not be taught in schools; unlike religious bigots, who despise atheists like myself - I have the letters to prove it - I am happy for it to be there, as an optional subject and taught in the context of cultural studies. That is what living in a plural society means: giving people, and that includes children, a choice about what they believe in. It does not mean, as happened to the children of some friends of mine in an Oxfordshire village, being sent home from school with instructions to write a letter to God. What I object to is children being indoctrinated in a single faith, at taxpayers' expense, and their parents forced to go along with it. This is no longer, as I have pointed out before, a Christian country, given that less than a million people, out of a population of 60m, attend Anglican services on Sundays. Even if it were, it is wrong in principle for state-funded schools to promote one religion over another, and to neglect other systems of thought, including humanism and atheism. I recognised this myself as a teenager, with comical results. Pointing out that I was not compelled by law to attend the parts of morning assembly that involved Christian worship, I declared that I would not in future take part in it. This caused consternation, though not because I was the first child in my state school in Hertfordshire to exercise this right. The others were girls from other religions, Catholics or observant Jews; what the school had not previously encountered was a conscientious objector who just wanted to read Jackie. What will happen to the next generation of 14-year-olds, packed off to Tony Blair's church secondary schools against their will? It is quite possible that some of them will decide that they don't want to attend mass or the local mosque; will the single-faith schools proposed in the green paper allow them to exercise freedom of conscience? It is fortunate that, in a society increasingly aware of the importance of universal human rights, an act now exists to protect them. The irony, that it is the creation of this peculiarly narrow-minded government, is almost too delicious to contemplate. comment@theguardian.com",

The damage to the train is horrendous but we will not know how badly the track is damaged until after the recovery operation has been completed.\" Nigel Metcalfe, spokesman for Tees, East and North Yorkshire ambulance aervice \"It's like a scene from a bomb explosion. The carnage is appalling. You can hear mobile phones going off deep inside the mangled wreckage. \"Our crews had to carry patients about 100 yards across muddy fields to the field hospital where they could be picked up by ambulance. It's very depressing and distressing ... People have every kind of injury you can imagine ? there are vast number of fractures. Janine Edwards, 22, from York, who survived the crash \"I heard screaming and shouting and the lights went out. I held on to the table in front of me and then there was a huge impact. \"My carriage was on its side. I was lucky, I was still in my seat, clinging to the table.\" Witness Peter Hintz, 61 \"I was asleep in bed and heard this tremendous noise outside. There was a bang followed by screeching and scraping ? The freight train destroyed my garden shed, workshop, summer house and caravan. Another few feet and it would have been in my living room ? I feel like I've had a very lucky escape - although my thoughts are with those who died or who were injured.\" Martin Minns, survivor of the 1999 Paddington rail crash \"This is just awful news. We don't know the cause yet but it appears to have been a freak accident ? It will hit [other survivors] hard. They will get flashbacks.\"",

While that incident cast doubt over the whole structure and management of the privatised railway with its fragmentation and profit motives, the central question in this latest accident is how a Land Rover managed to come off a motorway bridge and land on a mainline railway - into the path of two trains that had no time to stop. The Highways Agency is responsible for the rules governing the strength, positioning, inspection and maintenance of road barriers and it is here that the spotlight must fall initially as members of the British Transport Police and her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate begin their investigations. In the absence of solid information at this stage about why the Land Rover plunged off the road (after reportedly suffering a tyre blow-out) there is talk of a 'freak accident'. But there are usually important factors involved in any disaster of this kind that emerge during investigation and bring much wider issues into play. Questions will have to be asked about the condition of the road surface and the roadside barriers on the bridge at the time of the accident, and about the strength of barriers on roads that take large volumes of traffic above other highways or railway lines. It will also be necessary to test the driver of the Land Rover to see if he had any alcohol or drugs in his blood and to establish the speed and manner of his driving as well as the condition of his vehicle. These are exactly the sort of investigations that would be carried out on a train, its driver and the track and signalling conditions at a crash site if the accident had only involved the railways. It is especially worrying that a vehicle with the relatively small size of a Land Rover could plunge off the road and cause this disaster.

The crash happened on the East Coast main line, near Selby, North Yorkshire, after the 4.45am Newcastle to London train smashed into a Land Rover car that had slid off an M62 motorway bridge. A spokesman for Railtrack said it was believed the Land Rover, which was pulling a trailer, had suffered a blow out on the M62 and careered down an embankment before coming to rest on the rail line. The driver, a 36-year-old man from Lincolnshire who escaped the crash unharmed, left the vehicle and rang 999 to warn that a car was blocking the track.

The driver of the GNER train was seriously injured, British Transport Police said. The prime minister, Tony Blair, and the Queen have both said their thoughts are with the relatives of those killed in the crash. At Commons question time, Mr Blair described the accident as a \"terrible tragedy\" and promised the \"fullest possible inquiry\" into how it happened. He told a hushed House: \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the families, friends and relatives of those who died or were injured.\" A Railtrack spokeswoman described the crash scene as \"absolute devastation\". She said: \"Carriages have been overturned, they have gone down the embankment and into the field near the track.\" The sound of desperate knocking was heard from within the twisted carnage, firefighters said. Rescue workers heard the sound of abandoned mobile phones ringing as friends and relatives tried to contact the victims. The passenger train had left Newcastle and had stopped at Durham, Darlington, Northallerton and York. The front three carriages appeared to have been smashed from the rest of the GNER train. The first carriage was almost vertical, lying back on the second one, while a third ended up in a field next to the track, which was surrounded by debris from the collision. The freight train was carrying 1500 tonnes of coal and slid into the back garden of a house, crushing a caravan. Crash survivor Laurie Gunson, of York, spoke of his experience from Pontefract general infirmary, where he was being treated for injuries.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair and William Hague abandoned their usual guerrilla warfare at prime minister's questions this afternoon as a mark of respect for the victims of the Selby rail crash. In what could be one of the last question time sessions before the general election, Mr Hague immediately signalled that the day's tragic events ? in addition to the foot and mouth outbreak - meant that this was not the time for political pointscoring. He said: \"Everyone will understand if the usual robustness of our exchanges is somewhat suspended today.\" Prime minister Blair described the crash as a \"terrible tragedy\" and added \"our thoughts and prayers are with the families, friends and relatives of those who died or were injured.\" Mr Blair, Mr Hague and Charles Kennedy, the Liberal Democrat leader, were united in praising the emergency services and sending their thoughts to the families of the crash victims. The prime minister promised the \"fullest possible enquiry\" into the accident and announced that the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, would make a full statement to the House when he returned from the crash site. Labour MP John Grogan ? whose Selby constituency includes the crash site ? asked the prime minister: \"As well as expressing our hopes for the speedy recovery of the many injured in the terrible rail accident this morning, will you also acknowledge the role of the villagers in Great Heck, who were amongst the first on the scene?\" In the \"murk and the gloom\" of the early morning, villagers had provided what assistance they could, he said. Speculating about the cause of the accident, Mr Blair said: \"It's too early yet to be absolutely certain, although it appears to be the Land Rover and trailer having slipped off the motorway and down onto the track. \"The villagers have behaved in an extraordinary, neighbourly, exemplary way and it is remarkable how, in Britain, local communities in times of crisis like this pull together and do the very best for other people.\"",

Of course now El Tel's \"helping out\", things are different. Hapless Boro are no longer chasing an Irish Eurovision Song Contest winner, or an Israeli one for that matter, but a half-decent Barcelona striker. And Dani might well be heading to the Riverside for just \u00a37m - not the \u00a312m Robbo was quoted in those hazy, crazy days of last summer.</p> <p>\"There may be activity before the transfer deadline but not just for the sake of it,\" insisted \"first team coach\" Tel this afternoon. \"We have to feel it is going to improve us otherwise there is no point.\" But while El Tel is remaining coy, Robbo is showing no such restraint.

He went on to manage Wolverhampton, guiding them to three league titles during the 1950s.</p> <p>The League Managers Association has refuted claims that Bruce Rioch resigned as Wigan manager. \"Having spoken with Bruce Rioch over press reports that he has resigned as manager at Wigan, we are able to categorically state that this is not true,\" a LMA statement said.</p> <p>Fulham have been given the go-ahead to build a 30,000 capacity all-seater stadium on their Craven Cottage site. The project, which will cost \u00a370m, was given the green light by Hammersmith and Fulham council's planning committee last night and the club hope it will be ready for the 2003-04 season.</p> <p>The Republic of Ireland's friendly against Denmark has been called off due frozen terraces at Lansdowne Road. However Northern Ireland's game against Norway will go ahead.</p> <p>Danny Cadamarteri has pleaded not guilty to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in court today.

Cadamarteri will stand trial at Liverpool crown court on September 3.</p> <p>Arsenal defender Matthew Upson has expressed his frustration at not playing more regularly for the first team. \"I am not even getting a sniff at Arsenal,\" he admitted. \"How long can I go on waiting? Not long.\"</p> <p>A court case involving George Weah was postponed today after the former world player of the year failed to show up at a Lisbon court. Jorge Costa claims Weah head-butted him after a Champions League match between FC Porto and AC Milan in 1996. Weah admitted the assault during a UEFA investigation, which earned him a six-match ban, but said Costa provoked him with a series of dangerous fouls and racist insults during the game. </p> <p>Brentford have announced plans to ground-share with non-League Woking during the 2002-3 season while they seek a permanent new home following their expected departure from Griffin Park.</p> <p>Junior Lewis is expected to complete a permanent transfer to Leicester by the end of the week.

And Dani might well be heading to the Riverside for just \u00a37m - not the \u00a312m Robbo was quoted in those hazy, crazy days of last summer. \"There may be activity before the transfer deadline but not just for the sake of it,\" insisted \"first team coach\" Tel this afternoon. \"We have to feel it is going to improve us otherwise there is no point.\" But while El Tel is remaining coy, Robbo is showing no such restraint. According to reports he's already headed for the continent, armed with just a large stash of cash and the bargaining skills of chairman Steve Gibson. Let's hope they have more luck this time around eh! * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Atalanta have dismissed reports that Sir Alex Ferguson is interested in signing Cristiano Doni for \u00a33.5m. \"We haven't had any offer from Manchester United for Doni,\" the club told planetfootball.com. \"The story is not true.\" Chelsea are hoping to bring Marcello Salas and Pablo Negro to Stamford Bridge this summer, according to reports. Bradford goalkeeper Matt Clarke is likely to join Bolton on-loan until the end of the season. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Stan Cullis, former England captain and Woverhampton Wanderers manager, has died at the age of 85. Cullis played 12 times at centre half for his country in a career cut short by the second world war, captaining England against Romania in their final international before war broke out. He went on to manage Wolverhampton, guiding them to three league titles during the 1950s. The League Managers Association has refuted claims that Bruce Rioch resigned as Wigan manager. \"Having spoken with Bruce Rioch over press reports that he has resigned as manager at Wigan, we are able to categorically state that this is not true,\" a LMA statement said. Fulham have been given the go-ahead to build a 30,000 capacity all-seater stadium on their Craven Cottage site. The project, which will cost \u00a370m, was given the green light by Hammersmith and Fulham council's planning committee last night and the club hope it will be ready for the 2003-04 season. The Republic of Ireland's friendly against Denmark has been called off due frozen terraces at Lansdowne Road. However Northern Ireland's game against Norway will go ahead. Danny Cadamarteri has pleaded not guilty to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in court today. Joeline Joel, 24, suffered a broken cheekbone in the alleged incident last October. Cadamarteri will stand trial at Liverpool crown court on September 3. Arsenal defender Matthew Upson has expressed his frustration at not playing more regularly for the first team. \"I am not even getting a sniff at Arsenal,\" he admitted. \"How long can I go on waiting? Not long.\" A court case involving George Weah was postponed today after the former world player of the year failed to show up at a Lisbon court. Jorge Costa claims Weah head-butted him after a Champions League match between FC Porto and AC Milan in 1996. Weah admitted the assault during a UEFA investigation, which earned him a six-match ban, but said Costa provoked him with a series of dangerous fouls and racist insults during the game. Brentford have announced plans to ground-share with non-League Woking during the 2002-3 season while they seek a permanent new home following their expected departure from Griffin Park. Junior Lewis is expected to complete a permanent transfer to Leicester by the end of the week. Manager Andy Hessenthaler said: \"Nothing has been finalised yet, he has still to put pen to paper, but it will happen.\" Reading have signed Arsenal midfielder James Harper for an unspecified six-figure sum. Luton chairman Mike Watson-Challis has confirmed his club have bought 55 acres of land near Junction 10 of the M1 to build a new stadium. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: The Big Match - England v Spain (10.45pm) \"Hallo Mr TV and Radio.

He hopes that the party will be able to run candidates in 2002 in local state and national elections. In the meantime, it seems that he could save some money for the campaigns ahead by not making that 17th call to Hillary.

      "bodyText": "While reading a newspaper on the bus, an advert for a new car takes your fancy. Pulling out a pen-sized scanner, you scan a barcode on the page. Back at home, you plug the scanner into your computer and, hey presto, you are whisked to an internet page offering you a test drive. Far from this scenario being an advertiser's space-age dream, this technology is about to arrive in the UK. US company Digital:Convergence is launching the CueCat scanner in Europe with an international unit headed by Classic FM founder Stuart Graber. The company's investors include Coca-Cola and global advertising agency network Young &amp; Rubicam. Some of the agency's clients are already using the technology in their adverts. The Dallas and New York-based management team includes former Time Warner, AT&amp;T, GE, ING Barings and Disney executives. President and chief operating officer Michael Garin was global head of media communications investment bankers ING Barings for 11 years. Media Group president Scott Carlin worked for Warner Brothers Domestic Television Group for 19 years on shows including Friends and ER. But the technology is not limited to advertising - it is being used by media owners within editorial content. US business magazine Forbes launched the CueCat scanners in August last year with a free covermounted scanner and millions have been given away through computer retailer Radioshack. The Dallas Morning News and sports magazine Parade are using the technology within editorial and selling it as an option to their advertisers. Cuecat aims to take customers directly to information they are seeking, negating the need for lengthy web surfing. It could be used to scan supermarket products to access recipes or discount promotions, for example. PR network Burson-Marsteller's London office has been appointed to support the European launch. The network already works for Digital:Convergence in the US. The agency will be introducing the technology to the publishing, advertising, marketing, IT, retail and media industries in the UK.

      "bodyText": "Blooming with the success of its recent orchid festival and its African sculpture exhibition, Kew Gardens is seeking to capitalise on that popularity with an image revamp. The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew is on the hunt for new heads of marketing and PR. A new marketing strategy will be implemented to modernise the gardens, which were founded in 1759 by the widow of Frederick, Prince of Wales. Kew is seen as offering the same thing all year round - beautiful gardens - and the new strategy will see events launched throughout the year. A spokeswoman compared it to a museum or art gallery mounting and promoting changing exhibitions. Activities will be staged to attract different types of visitors - some appealing to couples and some aimed at families. Already garden bosses run themed areas for families such as the snow garden inside the Princess of Wales glass house. Kew's exhibition of the lifesize African sculptures in the grounds proved a major draw last year. Some events will be annual in an attempt to emulate the success of must-do dates in the horticultural diary such as the Chelsea Flower Show. But the spokeswoman pointed out that balancing the old and the new would be a difficult task. \"It is about becoming commercial,\" she said. \"But we don't want to turn Kew in to a Disney theme park. \"Look at the Victoria and Albert museum, it has been accused of being stuffy and is looking for a new press chief and branding consultants to help change that,\" she added. In May, a Japan 2001 exhibition will tie in with Japanese events at other London locations such as the Hayward Gallery and Hyde Park. Kew will use tube advertising for the first time in years to promote the event. Related story Feb 26: V&amp;A seeks new image",

The children's pay-TV broadcaster put its case in a submission to the government on the new BBC services. \"Homes with children have already led the way in adopting multichannel television and do not represent the digital 'resisters' the government and BBC want to target,\" the Nickelodeon submission stated. \"Nickelodeon and Nick Jr, along with other commercial children's channels, have established demand for multichannel television and are key players in expanding the market. \"There is no evidence new BBC children's services will drive digital take-up,\" it said. The BBC is seeking the permission of culture secretary Chris Smith to launch a pre-school service and an offering aimed at six to 13-year-olds. Today is the last day for submissions to Mr Smith on the proposals. \"The BBC has provided the secretary of state with a flimsy account of its planned children's services that do not in any way guarantee distinctiveness or value to the public,\" said Nickelodeon UK general manager Paul Lindley. \"All we know for sure is the proposed services would have a highly detrimental impact on innovation and investment by commercial players.\" Nickelodeon's submission points out that there are already 14 digital children's channels and a further nine services offering significant blocks of children's output, covering all age groups and programming genres. \"The BBC's proposed children's services duplicate what is already provided in the market and are not truly distinctive,\" the document stated. Nickelodeon also argued that the launch of the free-to-air BBC services will hit its own plans to increase investment in original UK production by \u00a330m over the next three years. \"These investment plans are based on assumptions of a level playing field and access to archive material from the BBC at market rates,\" the submission said. \"The uncertainty over free-to-air BBC entry into the market - and the refusal by the BBC to sell its library to secondary channels - makes this commitment uncertain.\" The Nickelodeon submission urged Mr Smith to \"consider in detail the costs involved in the new BBC services as proposed in terms of economic investment, creative risk-taking and innovation, and choice and plurality, and not merely the perceived benefits of two new BBC children's channels\". Mr Lindley added: \"Nickelodeon recommends the services should not be approved and the BBC should continue to provide benchmark children's programming on BBC1 and BBC1, and pursue its commercial aims in partnership with the commercial sector.\" He was one of a group of senior pay-TV executives who met Mr Smith last week. They expressed concern at the perceived shortcomings of the government approval process for the BBC digital services.

According to a report published this week, it has achieved astonishing results. Forty homes in five local authority pilot schemes have received packages of 50 brand new books from the Right to Read Project. The scheme is organised by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, the National Literacy Association and the Who Cares? Trust, which campaigns for the rights of children in care.

Lorraine Edwards, the home's unit manager, says the change in Angela since she discovered the pleasure of reading is profound: \"When she first arrived two years ago, she didn't read at all.

Consequently, the educational achievements of children in care are dismal, with 70% of children leaving with no qualifications and only 4% gaining five or more GCSEs. The NLA's goal is for 99% of these children to leave school with adequate literacy for daily life. </p> <p>Edwards says that the home's annual book budget is usually just \u00a325, which buys a few reference books but leaves little for fiction. The greatest constraint is financial: a Right to Read questionnaire circulated to the pilot schemes found that the most frequently cited reason for not having books in a home was lack of funds. Charlie Griffiths, NLA director, says that books have been seen as a luxury instead of a necessity: \"One of the things we're saying in the report is that funding books has got to be ongoing. It's not enough to give a home 50 books and say, that's it. It's got to be down to the local authority to find the money to fund books.\" </p> <p>If the people in charge of drawing up budgets were to compare the book budgets for children in care with the amount spent on their own children, they might think differently, Griffiths observes. \"Reading a book together is a shared magical experience.

Feel free to request a full and frank explanation of the intricacies of the menstrual cycle. Quiz me on willies/front bottoms/bowel function in a loud voice in a public place if you wish - anything at all - but please God, don't ask about the mountains of burning cows. </p> <p>Faced with the gut-churning photo-reportage of the foot-and- mouth outbreak over the past few days, even the most creative parent will be struggling to explain to a curious child why anyone in their right mind would want to build an enormous fire and summarily incinerate Daisy, Ermintrude and their friends. Garden waste, yes. Old boxes, certainly. But cute moo-cows? Has the world gone mad? </p> <p>You can understand the confusion. Children are brought up with the unshakeable belief that farm animals live charmed, Dappledown-style existences where nothing horrible ever happens. To then confront them with the reality - that Old Macdonald had a farm, certainly, but that he also had a shotgun, a freezer full of animal parts and a contract with the local abattoir - is to cloud somewhat the rosy picture. </p> <p>To be hit with the realisation that pigs, cows and sheep are not only slaughtered for their meat but sometimes contract illnesses of a sort that can't be cured with a couple of capfuls of Calpol is, to a child, shocking indeed. Where will it all end? If livestock is being torched, what hope is there for the mute, inanimate minority? Is Bagpuss safe? How long before Kipper the Dog meets a similar fate?

      "bodyText": "All of a sudden, your five-year-old's usual line of intimate questioning seems like a picnic by comparison. Go right ahead and ask me where babies come from. Feel free to request a full and frank explanation of the intricacies of the menstrual cycle. Quiz me on willies/front bottoms/bowel function in a loud voice in a public place if you wish - anything at all - but please God, don't ask about the mountains of burning cows. Faced with the gut-churning photo-reportage of the foot-and- mouth outbreak over the past few days, even the most creative parent will be struggling to explain to a curious child why anyone in their right mind would want to build an enormous fire and summarily incinerate Daisy, Ermintrude and their friends. Garden waste, yes. Old boxes, certainly. But cute moo-cows? Has the world gone mad? You can understand the confusion. Children are brought up with the unshakeable belief that farm animals live charmed, Dappledown-style existences where nothing horrible ever happens. To then confront them with the reality - that Old Macdonald had a farm, certainly, but that he also had a shotgun, a freezer full of animal parts and a contract with the local abattoir - is to cloud somewhat the rosy picture. To be hit with the realisation that pigs, cows and sheep are not only slaughtered for their meat but sometimes contract illnesses of a sort that can't be cured with a couple of capfuls of Calpol is, to a child, shocking indeed. Where will it all end? If livestock is being torched, what hope is there for the mute, inanimate minority? Is Bagpuss safe? How long before Kipper the Dog meets a similar fate? Is it only a matter of time before Rupert Bear, Sooty and the cast of Sesame Street end up on a smouldering pyre of singed acrylic? If some of the blame for children's entirely blinkered view of nature's brutality stops at the door of Beatrix Potter (red, small, carved into the side of a tree trunk) and all the other authors, film animators and illustrators who thought it would be a good idea to put hedgehogs in skirts and bestow upon small rodents the ability to emote and make major life decisions, a far greater responsibility lies with parents.

      "body": "<p><strong> Gillian Cross</strong><br> <strong>The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett </strong><br> </p> <p> The best books have a way of getting inside you and changing the way you think and feel and see. The Secret Garden, by Frances Hodgson Burnett, is like that for me. As a child, I read it more times than I can remember and it has coloured my whole view of the world. </p> <p>It is a book that has everything. A mysterious crying voice. A boy who tames animals. A lovely, hidden garden and a heroine who is loveable even while she is a selfish, bad-tempered victim - and who becomes even more loveable as she develops into a healthy, confident girl. </p> <p>As a child, I loved reading about Misselthwaite Manor, with its 100 rooms full of secret and lovely things. I envied Mary's solitary exploration of it and longed to find a house like that myself. I never have, but once, when I was a child, on holiday in the Isle of Wight, I struggled through undergrowth into a secret, walled garden with a fig tree in the middle. </p> <p>Every spring I remember The Secret Garden when I see the new green shoots. To this day, I see spring through Mary Lennox's eyes, as a combination of promise and challenge. All my life - because of Mary - I have known that everyone needs love and work and hope. And all my life, I have believed that, given those, we can escape from the things that stunt and restrict us and grow into the people we were meant to be. Thank you, Frances Hodgson Burnett. </p> <p> Gillian Cross is author of the Demon Headmaster series. Her next novel, Calling a Dead Man (Oxford, \u00a36.99), will be published in October. </p> <p><strong> Quentin Blake</strong> <br> <strong>Chicks' Own Annual 1937 </strong><br> </p> <p> Perhaps the most significant book of my childhood was what may have been the first: on my fourth birthday in December 1936, my mother and father gave me a copy of Chicks' Own Annual for 1937. Chicks' Own was one of those weekly children's comics (price 2d, every Tuesday) with some stories in strip-cartoon form and other simple stories of a page each, a formula reflected in the annual. Two-syllable words were divided by a hyphen for easier reading. </p> <p>The hero was Rupert, a little yellow chick. He had a red beak; his friend was to the same design but black with a yellow beak. There was a curious convention about the beaks: normal beaks seen in profile, they be came a nose and a mouth seen head on. The chicks were child-sized, and went to a school where their friends were other animals such as Teethy-y Croc-o-dile and Stri-pey Ti-ger, who were not much bigger than they were. </p> <p>The interesting thing to me, in retrospect, is that I am sure that I was aware already that some of the drawings were better than others. Many were flat and anaemic, but those for the Rupert stories had satisfyingly substantial forms; the wheels on Rupert's train really looked as though they would go round, and the bowl of pudding they found in the pirates' cave really looked worth eating. Looking again at these drawings in more recent years I see that they were signed A White and that they were probably influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by Benjamin Rabier, the early 20th-century artist best known for the goose Gedeon, and some of whose books are still in print. When, about a year ago, I was invited to take part, with a handful of French illustrators, in an exhibition called Les Fils Spirituels de Benjamin Rabier, I had assumed that Spiritual Sons was just a convenient label for some artists who liked drawing animals. And no doubt it was: by turning again the pages of Chicks' Own Annual (which I still have), I came to realise that there was, after all, an element of truth in the description. </p> <p> Quentin Blake's Tell Me A Picture (National Gallery, \u00a39.95) mixes old and modern pictures with his own drawings in a book which parallels the exhibition at the National Gallery until June 17. </p> <p><strong> Malorie Blackman</strong> <br> <strong>The Silver Chair by CS Lewis </strong><br> </p> <p> Books can change your life. I know, because that's what my favourite book - The Silver Chair by CS Lewis - did for me. Do you know that feeling when you learn something new and you're instantly aware of its truth for you at that moment and for the rest of your life? That's how I felt when I read chapter 12 of this book. </p> <p>Prince Rilian, Puddleglum, Eustace and Jill are confronted by the Wicked Queen as she tries to seduce them with sweet words and drugged fire into believing that her world is the only real world - that there is no sun, no Narnia, no Aslan. </p> <p>It was Puddleglum's words after he had destroyed the drugged fire that spoke to me. If there's no sun and no country and no Aslan, he'll still go on believing in them, because it's better than the alternative. I realise now that that chapter gave me the courage to believe in myself. When others tried to tell me that I couldn't do, shouldn't think, had no right to feel, somewhere deep down, I'd remember that chapter and I'd know that with God's help and belief in myself, I could do anything. I could even become a writer. </p> <p> Malorie Blackman's latest book is Noughts &amp; Crosses (Doubleday, \u00a310.99). </p> <p><strong> Dick King-Smith</strong> <br> <strong>The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling </strong><br> </p> <p> As a child, I liked best to read stories about animals. Beatrix Potter's little beasts were probably the first to catch my eye, Winnie the Pooh and the riverside folk of The Wind in the Willows following. Then I came upon Kipling's The Jungle Book. I was fascinated by all the stories in it, but principally by the one called \"Tiger! Tiger!\" I thought then that the telling of the death of Shere Khan was the most wonderful piece of descriptive writing, and I think I would hold to that view today. </p> <p>I could imagine the scene as vividly as though I were Mowgli on the back of Rama, the great herd bull, at the head of the narrow dry ravine of the Waingunga river. The wolves have split the buffalo herd in two, Gray Brother holding the cows at the foot of the ravine, Akela with the bulls at the head, awaiting Mowgli's order to drive them down to where the full-fed tiger is lying. The walls of the ravine are straight. There is no escape for the lame tiger, and Rama \"tripped, stumbled, and went on again over something soft, and, with the bulls at his heels, crashed full into the other herd. </p> <p>\"Shere Khan needed no more trampling. He was dead, and the kites were coming for him already. </p> <p>\"'Brother, that was a dog's death,' said Mowgli.\" </p> <p> Dick King-Smith is the author of the Babe the Pig stories. His most recent books are The Roundhill and Billy the Bird (Puffin, \u00a33.99 each). </p> <p><strong> Kevin Crossley-Holland</strong> <br> <strong>The Wool-pack by Cynthia Harnett </strong><br> </p> <p> I'm going for Cynthia Harnett's Carnegie medal-winning The Woolpack, published in 1951, because it is the first book I bought for myself. It cost 10/- of my Christmas money, as my endpaper note of December 28 1953 records rather ruefully. </p> <p>The author's knowledge of late 15th-century life and the Cotswold wooltrade is lightly worn but wonderfully convincing. She abides by Jill Paton Walsh's useful maxim that the historical novelist may employ the \"not known to be true\" but not the \"known not to be true\". Further, she has very little truck with the olde-tyme speeche: her dialogue is largely simple and clean, if now slightly dated. </p> <p>Harnett likes human beings, warts and all; she is, above all, at home with childhood, its frankness and playfulness and exuberance and vulnerability. And she sees it, like the past, as another country. In 1953, aged 12, all I knew was that it was thrilling to read a story about smuggling and skulduggery. First and foremost, Harnett knew how to tell a story. </p> <p> Kevin Crossley-Holland's novel The Seeing Stone (Orion, \u00a310.99) was shortlisted for the 2000 Whitbread Children's Book of the Year. </p> <p><strong> Francesca Simon </strong> <br> <strong>Half Magic by Edward Eager </strong><br> </p> <p> I was nine or 10 when I discovered Edward Eager's fantastic books about a group of children's magic adventures. Half Magic was the first. Katharine, Jane, Mark and Martha pick up a coin on the way to the library. They think it's an ordinary nickel, but gradually discover, after a series of mishaps, that it's a magic coin. </p> <p>The catch is that it only grants half your wish. So when the youngest, Martha, is sick of being bossed around by her siblings, she wishes she wasn't there. Half of her remains, the other flits about wrecking ghostly havoc. The books enthralled me. The children were unlike the usual story-book children: they fought and argued; their widowed mother had big money troubles; they were bookish and imaginative.

      "bodyText": "Gillian Cross The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett The best books have a way of getting inside you and changing the way you think and feel and see. The Secret Garden, by Frances Hodgson Burnett, is like that for me. As a child, I read it more times than I can remember and it has coloured my whole view of the world. It is a book that has everything. A mysterious crying voice. A boy who tames animals. A lovely, hidden garden and a heroine who is loveable even while she is a selfish, bad-tempered victim - and who becomes even more loveable as she develops into a healthy, confident girl. As a child, I loved reading about Misselthwaite Manor, with its 100 rooms full of secret and lovely things. I envied Mary's solitary exploration of it and longed to find a house like that myself. I never have, but once, when I was a child, on holiday in the Isle of Wight, I struggled through undergrowth into a secret, walled garden with a fig tree in the middle. Every spring I remember The Secret Garden when I see the new green shoots. To this day, I see spring through Mary Lennox's eyes, as a combination of promise and challenge. All my life - because of Mary - I have known that everyone needs love and work and hope. And all my life, I have believed that, given those, we can escape from the things that stunt and restrict us and grow into the people we were meant to be. Thank you, Frances Hodgson Burnett. Gillian Cross is author of the Demon Headmaster series. Her next novel, Calling a Dead Man (Oxford, \u00a36.99), will be published in October. Quentin Blake Chicks' Own Annual 1937 Perhaps the most significant book of my childhood was what may have been the first: on my fourth birthday in December 1936, my mother and father gave me a copy of Chicks' Own Annual for 1937. Chicks' Own was one of those weekly children's comics (price 2d, every Tuesday) with some stories in strip-cartoon form and other simple stories of a page each, a formula reflected in the annual. Two-syllable words were divided by a hyphen for easier reading. The hero was Rupert, a little yellow chick. He had a red beak; his friend was to the same design but black with a yellow beak. There was a curious convention about the beaks: normal beaks seen in profile, they be came a nose and a mouth seen head on. The chicks were child-sized, and went to a school where their friends were other animals such as Teethy-y Croc-o-dile and Stri-pey Ti-ger, who were not much bigger than they were. The interesting thing to me, in retrospect, is that I am sure that I was aware already that some of the drawings were better than others. Many were flat and anaemic, but those for the Rupert stories had satisfyingly substantial forms; the wheels on Rupert's train really looked as though they would go round, and the bowl of pudding they found in the pirates' cave really looked worth eating. Looking again at these drawings in more recent years I see that they were signed A White and that they were probably influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by Benjamin Rabier, the early 20th-century artist best known for the goose Gedeon, and some of whose books are still in print. When, about a year ago, I was invited to take part, with a handful of French illustrators, in an exhibition called Les Fils Spirituels de Benjamin Rabier, I had assumed that Spiritual Sons was just a convenient label for some artists who liked drawing animals. And no doubt it was: by turning again the pages of Chicks' Own Annual (which I still have), I came to realise that there was, after all, an element of truth in the description. Quentin Blake's Tell Me A Picture (National Gallery, \u00a39.95) mixes old and modern pictures with his own drawings in a book which parallels the exhibition at the National Gallery until June 17. Malorie Blackman The Silver Chair by CS Lewis Books can change your life. I know, because that's what my favourite book - The Silver Chair by CS Lewis - did for me. Do you know that feeling when you learn something new and you're instantly aware of its truth for you at that moment and for the rest of your life? That's how I felt when I read chapter 12 of this book. Prince Rilian, Puddleglum, Eustace and Jill are confronted by the Wicked Queen as she tries to seduce them with sweet words and drugged fire into believing that her world is the only real world - that there is no sun, no Narnia, no Aslan. It was Puddleglum's words after he had destroyed the drugged fire that spoke to me. If there's no sun and no country and no Aslan, he'll still go on believing in them, because it's better than the alternative. I realise now that that chapter gave me the courage to believe in myself. When others tried to tell me that I couldn't do, shouldn't think, had no right to feel, somewhere deep down, I'd remember that chapter and I'd know that with God's help and belief in myself, I could do anything. I could even become a writer. Malorie Blackman's latest book is Noughts &amp; Crosses (Doubleday, \u00a310.99). Dick King-Smith The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling As a child, I liked best to read stories about animals. Beatrix Potter's little beasts were probably the first to catch my eye, Winnie the Pooh and the riverside folk of The Wind in the Willows following. Then I came upon Kipling's The Jungle Book. I was fascinated by all the stories in it, but principally by the one called \"Tiger! Tiger!\" I thought then that the telling of the death of Shere Khan was the most wonderful piece of descriptive writing, and I think I would hold to that view today. I could imagine the scene as vividly as though I were Mowgli on the back of Rama, the great herd bull, at the head of the narrow dry ravine of the Waingunga river. The wolves have split the buffalo herd in two, Gray Brother holding the cows at the foot of the ravine, Akela with the bulls at the head, awaiting Mowgli's order to drive them down to where the full-fed tiger is lying. The walls of the ravine are straight. There is no escape for the lame tiger, and Rama \"tripped, stumbled, and went on again over something soft, and, with the bulls at his heels, crashed full into the other herd. \"Shere Khan needed no more trampling. He was dead, and the kites were coming for him already. \"'Brother, that was a dog's death,' said Mowgli.\" Dick King-Smith is the author of the Babe the Pig stories. His most recent books are The Roundhill and Billy the Bird (Puffin, \u00a33.99 each). Kevin Crossley-Holland The Wool-pack by Cynthia Harnett I'm going for Cynthia Harnett's Carnegie medal-winning The Woolpack, published in 1951, because it is the first book I bought for myself. It cost 10/- of my Christmas money, as my endpaper note of December 28 1953 records rather ruefully. The author's knowledge of late 15th-century life and the Cotswold wooltrade is lightly worn but wonderfully convincing. She abides by Jill Paton Walsh's useful maxim that the historical novelist may employ the \"not known to be true\" but not the \"known not to be true\". Further, she has very little truck with the olde-tyme speeche: her dialogue is largely simple and clean, if now slightly dated. Harnett likes human beings, warts and all; she is, above all, at home with childhood, its frankness and playfulness and exuberance and vulnerability. And she sees it, like the past, as another country. In 1953, aged 12, all I knew was that it was thrilling to read a story about smuggling and skulduggery. First and foremost, Harnett knew how to tell a story. Kevin Crossley-Holland's novel The Seeing Stone (Orion, \u00a310.99) was shortlisted for the 2000 Whitbread Children's Book of the Year. Francesca Simon Half Magic by Edward Eager I was nine or 10 when I discovered Edward Eager's fantastic books about a group of children's magic adventures. Half Magic was the first. Katharine, Jane, Mark and Martha pick up a coin on the way to the library. They think it's an ordinary nickel, but gradually discover, after a series of mishaps, that it's a magic coin. The catch is that it only grants half your wish. So when the youngest, Martha, is sick of being bossed around by her siblings, she wishes she wasn't there. Half of her remains, the other flits about wrecking ghostly havoc. The books enthralled me. The children were unlike the usual story-book children: they fought and argued; their widowed mother had big money troubles; they were bookish and imaginative. If magic could happen to an ordinary family, it could happen to anyone. Even to me. Francesca Simon's latest book, Horrid Henry and the Mummy's Curse (\u00a33.99, Dolphin), is a World Book Day Super Reads promotion Michael Rosen A White Sail Gleams by Valentin Katayev My mother found obscure and absorbing books to read to me, such as Miskito Boy and Raff the Jungle Bird, alongside Beatrix Potter and Norse myths.

      "body": "<p>The battered e-commerce sector yesterday claimed its biggest casualty yet when <a href=\"http://www.etoys.com\">eToys</a> - a US company once valued in excess of \u00a312bn - filed for bankruptcy, declaring its shares \"worthless\". </p> <p>The online toyseller said that it had no choice after failing to find a buyer. It said its stated debt figure of $274m (\u00a3190m) was likely to become \"substantially higher\" when the full amount of monies owing was finally calculated. </p> <p>Shares in eToys were suspended, having last traded at just nine cents each and valuing the firm at \u00a314m. At their height in 1999 the shares changed hands for $80 each. </p> <p>\"The climate we faced remained extremely harsh and a buyer did not emerge,\" eToys spokesman Ken Ross said. </p> <p>The website will be closed on March 8, cash will run out on March 31 and all employees will be fired by April 6, the company added. </p> <p>The collapse of eToys comes less than two years after it was being hailed as a business pioneer that stood to change the way people shopped for their toys forever. </p> <p>Founded in 1998, it raised $50m in venture capital funding as a private company and a further $166m when it floated on the Nasdaq stock market in 1999. </p> <p>Initial customer service was deemed to be poor and it struggled to fulfil orders during its first Christmas season. However, analysts and investors maintained it would emerge as a winner even if the dot.com bubble burst. Competitors like Toys R Us said they believed the \"first mover\" advantage of building a big internet presence would make it hard to compete with. </p> <p>Executives invested heavily in rectifying the fulfilment problems, building state of the art warehouses and computer systems. </p> <p>In December eToys said it was likely to run out of cash by March if it did not receive \"additional, substantial capital infusion\". Strong sales of $131m last Christmas suggested eToys might have turned the corner but it appears that the extra money it spent simply tipped it over the edge. </p> <p>Analysts said it should have sold at least $200m worth of goods during the festive season to stay afloat. </p> <p>Three days into the new year eToys said it would shut down its UK operation with the loss of 74 jobs. At one stage the operation, which had a turnover of \u00a31.6m in its first six months, employed 100 people. </p> <p>The announcement was made on the company's website with an image of children's favourite Bob the Builder asking \"Can we fix it?\" and a reply saying \"No we can't\". </p> <p>Established toy retailers such as Toys R Us, Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target have been the biggest thorn in eToys side.

      "bodyText": "The battered e-commerce sector yesterday claimed its biggest casualty yet when eToys - a US company once valued in excess of \u00a312bn - filed for bankruptcy, declaring its shares \"worthless\". The online toyseller said that it had no choice after failing to find a buyer. It said its stated debt figure of $274m (\u00a3190m) was likely to become \"substantially higher\" when the full amount of monies owing was finally calculated. Shares in eToys were suspended, having last traded at just nine cents each and valuing the firm at \u00a314m. At their height in 1999 the shares changed hands for $80 each. \"The climate we faced remained extremely harsh and a buyer did not emerge,\" eToys spokesman Ken Ross said. The website will be closed on March 8, cash will run out on March 31 and all employees will be fired by April 6, the company added. The collapse of eToys comes less than two years after it was being hailed as a business pioneer that stood to change the way people shopped for their toys forever. Founded in 1998, it raised $50m in venture capital funding as a private company and a further $166m when it floated on the Nasdaq stock market in 1999. Initial customer service was deemed to be poor and it struggled to fulfil orders during its first Christmas season. However, analysts and investors maintained it would emerge as a winner even if the dot.com bubble burst. Competitors like Toys R Us said they believed the \"first mover\" advantage of building a big internet presence would make it hard to compete with. Executives invested heavily in rectifying the fulfilment problems, building state of the art warehouses and computer systems. In December eToys said it was likely to run out of cash by March if it did not receive \"additional, substantial capital infusion\". Strong sales of $131m last Christmas suggested eToys might have turned the corner but it appears that the extra money it spent simply tipped it over the edge. Analysts said it should have sold at least $200m worth of goods during the festive season to stay afloat. Three days into the new year eToys said it would shut down its UK operation with the loss of 74 jobs. At one stage the operation, which had a turnover of \u00a31.6m in its first six months, employed 100 people. The announcement was made on the company's website with an image of children's favourite Bob the Builder asking \"Can we fix it?\" and a reply saying \"No we can't\". Established toy retailers such as Toys R Us, Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target have been the biggest thorn in eToys side. A partnership between Toys R Us and online retailer Amazon.com was another blow. UK e-commerce firms have not been immune from difficulties. Debt laden e-tailer LetsBuyIt.com was recently forced to refinance, while Boo.com and Clickmango.com folded.",

I'm really rather surprised that there's so much interest in this piece. Mind you, I'd be happy to spend \u00a3100,000 over the four days if it's worth it.\"</p> <p>The serious money will be made today and over the next two days, as thousands of laptops, lighting rigs and pieces of catering equipment are sold off, but yesterday's auction was a festival of pointlessness to rival the Millennium Experience itself.</p> <p>In a futuristic blue-and-silver auditorium a few hundred metres from the dome, auctioneer John Judson gamely trotted out the usual cliches - \"a rather special item coming up now,\" and \"a very unusual piece, this\". But that kind of patter was never going to work, because everything on sale - from the giant brains to the imitation tree trunks to the snowman costumes to the inflatable greenhouses to the \"angel-winged interactive pods\" - was fundamentally unusual, and the prices some were prepared to pay for them even more so.</p> <p>\"I never went to the dome because I thought it was an abhorrent waste of public money, but this is different,\" said Benedict Davies, a 32-year-old product developer, who had his eye on several scraps of fake human tissue encased in plastic which he reckoned might look attractive sunken into the floor of his living room. \"It's a souvenir of a national disaster. It's a very British thing to do, isn't it?\"</p> <p>It was somewhere around the time that a single floor tile from the money zone went for \u00a3120 (\"I hope you enjoy it, sir,\" said the auctioneer, mystified) that I realised I certainly wasn't going to get a major piece of the body - the heart, say, or the eye - for a more reasonable \u00a3100. In fact, I was going to be lucky to get a seed head parade costume, as exuberantly modelled in the auction room by an outgoing member of dome staff, or, for that matter, a \"recycled seagull built from kitchen utensils\".</p> <p>At one point in the often chaotic bidding process I was sure I had bagged one of the sought-after body zone mannequins, but given the resemblance it later turned out to bear to some kind of sex toy, it was a relief to discover that I hadn't, and thus wouldn't be forced to cart it back on the Jubilee line during the rush hour. Another mannequin, a depressed-looking man in an England shirt, his head in his hands, was bought by a sadistic Scot. Eventually, arms flailing, it was almost by accident that I bought my first piece of 21st century history: 10 hamster cages, inconveniently bolted together, at \u00a325 the lot.</p> <p>Back in the cavernous, stripped down dome itself, where the lots were being held and Christmas decorations still adorned the walls, the remaining handful of dome employees watched forlornly as punters came to dismantle their workplace. \"Psychologically, I suppose it's healthy,\" said 43-year-old Chris Aygin with dismay as she kept guard over four mannequins in surgical dress which would later sell for \u00a3320. \"We've come to the funeral, we're burying the body, and we're grieving.\"</p> <p>Around them, buyers struggled to rationalise the motives behind their acquisitions. \"It's just a bit of fun,\" said Anne Creasey, who had travelled down from Ludlow in Shropshire for the day with her farmer husband Chris, and would be returning with a giant's sink and draining board, a comically huge iron bed and a mysterious 12ft balustrade. \"Maybe we can put it in the children's playroom or something. I don't know. It's just a bit of fun,\" she said again, perhaps a little too insistently.</p> <p>Gavin Pretor-Pinney, the 32-year-old co-founder of The Idler magazine, had snapped up the body's enormous eye - complete with sinisterly glistening cornea - for \u00a3500, but didn't seem wholly reconciled to the fact. \"I'm not entirely sure what I've done,\" he said. \"I mean, I haven't got enough room for it in my flat. It was a really stupid idea, actually.\" Then his face brightened. \"But it could be one for Damien Hirst, couldn't it? I've just bought a Damien Hirst for \u00a3500!\"</p> <p>The pubic louse wasn't nearly so much of a bargain as the eye, but at \u00a3100 it was affordable. In fact, nobody seemed very clear whether the foot-long piece of jelly-like plastic with metal attachments really was a pubic louse, or just a skin mite: in the catalogue it was identified only as \"a parasite\". In a former incarnation, it used to scuttle up and down the body, but it is not clear whether its mechanical parts will ever function quite as they once did. Several similar ones went to an antiques dealer from Epsom, who said he would use them to scare his wife and children.</p> <p>\"It's a bit sad, really,\" said Geoff, the dome worker who came to help me extract the louse from its storage box. \"I used to work with this guy.\"</p> <p><b>What they paid</b></p> <p><b> \u0095 </b> Giant hamster and cheese <b> \u00a33,000</b>.</p> <p><b> \u0095 </b> \"Time cogs\" engraved crystal dish <b> \u00a31,700</b>.</p> <p><b> \u0095 </b> Piaggio Vespa scooter, (incomplete) <b> \u00a31,250</b>.</p> <p><b> \u0095 </b> Mannequin wearing England soccer shirt, head in hands<b> \u00a3900</b>.</p> <p><b> \u0095 </b> A brain, from the body zone <b> \u00a3700</b>.</p> <p><b> \u0095 </b> Heart from the body zone <b> \u00a31,500</b>.</p> <p><b> \u0095 </b> \"Time machine\" brass-faced clock and two Blackadder paintings <b> \u00a3650 </b></p> <p><b>\u0095 </b> The eye from the body zone <b> \u00a3500</b>.</p> <p><b> \u0095 </b> Front half of a flower power Mini (\"no tax or MoT\") <b> \u00a3450</b>.</p> <p><b> \u0095 </b> A snowman costume, hat and scarf <b> \u00a3180</b>.</p> <p><b> \u0095 </b> A spotted glass floor tile <b> \u00a3120</b>.</p> <p><b> \u0095 </b> 10 hamster cages <b> \u00a325</b>.</p> <p><b> \u0095 </b> \"Theo\" millennium show costume <b> \u00a320</b>.</p> <p><b> \u0095 </b> Oversized metal chair <b> \u00a315</b>.</p> <p>Prices exclude 10% buyers' premium and 17.5% VAT.</p>",

Back in the cavernous, stripped down dome itself, where the lots were being held and Christmas decorations still adorned the walls, the remaining handful of dome employees watched forlornly as punters came to dismantle their workplace. \"Psychologically, I suppose it's healthy,\" said 43-year-old Chris Aygin with dismay as she kept guard over four mannequins in surgical dress which would later sell for \u00a3320. \"We've come to the funeral, we're burying the body, and we're grieving.\" Around them, buyers struggled to rationalise the motives behind their acquisitions. \"It's just a bit of fun,\" said Anne Creasey, who had travelled down from Ludlow in Shropshire for the day with her farmer husband Chris, and would be returning with a giant's sink and draining board, a comically huge iron bed and a mysterious 12ft balustrade. \"Maybe we can put it in the children's playroom or something. I don't know. It's just a bit of fun,\" she said again, perhaps a little too insistently. Gavin Pretor-Pinney, the 32-year-old co-founder of The Idler magazine, had snapped up the body's enormous eye - complete with sinisterly glistening cornea - for \u00a3500, but didn't seem wholly reconciled to the fact. \"I'm not entirely sure what I've done,\" he said. \"I mean, I haven't got enough room for it in my flat. It was a really stupid idea, actually.\" Then his face brightened. \"But it could be one for Damien Hirst, couldn't it? I've just bought a Damien Hirst for \u00a3500!\" The pubic louse wasn't nearly so much of a bargain as the eye, but at \u00a3100 it was affordable. In fact, nobody seemed very clear whether the foot-long piece of jelly-like plastic with metal attachments really was a pubic louse, or just a skin mite: in the catalogue it was identified only as \"a parasite\". In a former incarnation, it used to scuttle up and down the body, but it is not clear whether its mechanical parts will ever function quite as they once did. Several similar ones went to an antiques dealer from Epsom, who said he would use them to scare his wife and children. \"It's a bit sad, really,\" said Geoff, the dome worker who came to help me extract the louse from its storage box. \"I used to work with this guy.\" What they paid \u0095 Giant hamster and cheese \u00a33,000. \u0095 \"Time cogs\" engraved crystal dish \u00a31,700. \u0095 Piaggio Vespa scooter, (incomplete) \u00a31,250. \u0095 Mannequin wearing England soccer shirt, head in hands \u00a3900. \u0095 A brain, from the body zone \u00a3700. \u0095 Heart from the body zone \u00a31,500. \u0095 \"Time machine\" brass-faced clock and two Blackadder paintings \u00a3650 \u0095 The eye from the body zone \u00a3500. \u0095 Front half of a flower power Mini (\"no tax or MoT\") \u00a3450. \u0095 A snowman costume, hat and scarf \u00a3180. \u0095 A spotted glass floor tile \u00a3120. \u0095 10 hamster cages \u00a325. \u0095 \"Theo\" millennium show costume \u00a320. \u0095 Oversized metal chair \u00a315.

      "bodyText": "A Dutch lorry driver played an active part in a people smuggling operation which saw 58 Chinese immigrants suffocate in the back of a lorry bound for Britain, a court heard today. Perry Wacker, 32, of Rotterdam, Holland, is charged with 58 counts of manslaughter and four counts of conspiracy to smuggle people into Britain. Female interpreter Ying Guo, 29, of Rivenhall Gardens, south Woodford, Essex, is jointly charged with Wacker on another count of conspiracy to smuggle immigrants into Britain. Both deny all charges. The 54 men and four women suffocated as they tried to enter Britain illegally in the back of a truck laden with tomatoes on June 18 last year. Shocked customs and excise officers discovered the bodies - and two male survivors - in a sealed lorry container at Dover's eastern docks. A jury at Maidstone crown court today heard how Mr Wacker and Ms Guo had both been involved to different degrees in a worldwide people-smuggling network. Victor Temple QC, prosecuting, said that it was important to understand the background of where the immigrants came from. \"Life in China can be very hard, work is often difficult to obtain and wages low,\" he said. \"Some choose to settle in continental Europe, others come to Britain. Many come without papers, crossing the channel in ways so as not to come the attention of the immigration authorities. He said a people smuggling organisation called the Snakeheads charged up to \u00a320,000 per person. \"If discovered, such people will often put forward false claims for asylum as political refugees.\" Mr Temple said that in June last year, 60 Chinese immigrants were waiting in two safe houses in Rotterdam, having travelled across Europe from their homeland. He said Wacker did not fall into the role of the driver who was recruited at the last minute for a one-off fee. \"The crown says he was more deeply involved. He concerned himself in executing the transport side of the operation that led, in turn, to his driving the 60 Chinese immigrants onto a P&amp;O ferry during a hot summer evening. \"The luckless and unfortunate Chinese were obliged to sit or squat in an airtight container with little or no opportunity to move and only a little water to quench their thirst.\" Original report 20.06.2000: Grim find of 58 bodies in lorry exposes smugglers' evil trade Interactive Guide to asylum seekers in Europe Useful links HM customs and excise Port of Dover P&amp;O ferries",

Meanwhile Wimbledon wanted to ground share with the London Broncos, but it's not their ground, and Crystal Palace said no.\" PROVE A TOKYO BAR OWNER WRONG! \"The owner of our local bar here in Tokyo, states that Sweden, Holland, Belgium, France and Portugal are the only European sides, outside of the British Isles, to ever field a black player in a full international. We think that he is talking out of his arse, can someone please help us out, so that we can shut him up?\" says Nigel Drake. Of course. Just tell him that Vicente Engonga played for Spain during 2000 - that should do the trick. LITTLE BROTHERS TRYING TO MAKE IT BIG: PART 2 \"At the moment in Italy, Christian Vieri's little brother Massimiliano and Roberto Baggio's little bro' Eddy are playing together for Serie B side Ancona. Are there any other younger brothers of big name players attempting to do likewise? asked Martin Casey. Last week we mentioned Youssouf Hadji (younger brother of Coventry's Mustapha) and Egutu Oliseh (same of Borussia Dortmund's Sunday). But as Paul Crankshaw points out there are big name brothers playing closer to home. \"Rhodri Giggs and Chris Brown, brothers of Ryan and Wes, play for Bangor City - they were recently joined by Clayton Blackmore,\" he says. Can you help? \"Me and my friends got talking about this without resolution, what is the most popular colour for a teams shirt in all four divisions?\" asks Stephen M. \"Can someone tell me who has played for the most professional clubs during a season or career?\" asks Derek Tomkin. \"Has there ever been a player who, after being sold by his club, came back to score against them in an FA cup final?\" asks Lee Cafferkey. \"Having watched the recent penalty shoot out in FA Cup replay between Wimbledon and Wycombe, does anybody know what the highest score in a penalty shoot out is and who the teams were?\" asks Richard Beeby. \"Apparently on June 25th 1975, in a match between Chile and Uruguay there were nineteen players sent off (ten Chileans and nine Uruguayans). What was the rumpus that caused the ref such a problem?\" asks Kevin Jones. Send your answers to the.boss@theguardian.com.",

More than 8m viewers tuned in to BBC1's 6.30pm regional bulletins around the country to find out the latest news on foot and mouth disease in their area. The combined audience for BBC1's 30-minute early evening regional news yesterday was the highest since the fuel crisis last autumn. It was also 1m up on Monday, which is usually the most-watched bulletin of the week as people tune in after the weekend break. The regional news had 8.1m viewers - a 36% share of viewing at that time - according to unofficial overnights. It beat the ITV Evening News, which had 6.7m viewers from 6.30pm. From 6pm, the ITV regional news magazines pulled in 5.8m and a 28% share. Elsewhere last night, the gossip surrounding Robbie Williams and Geri Halliwell helped the Brit Awards pull in more than 8m viewers on ITV. The two-hour pop extravaganza beat BBC1 drama opposition Holby City and In Deep from 8pm. The Brit Awards gained 8.4m viewers and a 33% audience share. Hospital drama Holby City ran the ITV show close, notching up 8m pairs of eyeballs; while undercover cop show In Deep managed 6.9m. Earlier in the evening, EastEnders pulled in a stonking 15.6m audience - three in five viewers watching TV at the time - between 7.30pm and 8pm. The eve of Mel's and Steve's wedding proved a big draw. BBC1's Ten o'Clock News won the battle of the 10pm bulletins, with 6.6m viewers to News at Ten's 5.4m. On Channel 5, a repeat of the Patrick Swayze movie Road House did good business from 10pm. The action film pulled in 2.4m viewers and an 18% share. Earlier on in the evening, Channel 5 carried live coverage of a France v Germany football friendly from Paris between 7.30pm and 10pm.",

There are also fears that the disease may have crossed to Northern Ireland, after a farm in Meigh, in South Armagh, that had recieved livestock from a Carlisle market was sealed off. The disease has an incubation period of 14 days so more outbreaks are expected. \"It's changing all the time,\" said chief veterinary officer Jim Scudamore. \"There will be others coming in as we get results.\" The government has extended the overall ban on moving livestock until March 16 but promised a plan to allow farmers to move disease-free animals under strict conditions. In Germany, vets have discovered that animals among 1,500 sheep imported from Britain are infected with antibodies for the disease. The environment minister for the state of North Rhine Westphalia described the finding - made on a farm near D\u00fcsseldorf - as an alarm signal for Germany Earlier the EU extended the ban on Britain's meat and dairy exports until March 9. EU health commissioner David Byrne praised \"very strict\" government action to contain the outbreak, saying all that could be done was being done.

As Ms Pollock points out, the main difference between then and now is that \"the expansion of the private residential and domiciliary intermediate care market will be funded mainly out of user charges, not social security\". There will be additional pressures on care trusts to commission intermediate care wherever they can find it, because it is seen as a way of relieving so-called bed blocking in hospitals.

      "body": "<p>The flames turning the night sky orange, the stench of burning flesh - no wonder the talk in the countryside is of apocalypse. \"We are on the threshold of Armageddon,\" warns the National Farmers Union man in Devon, girding himself for another night of slaughter, another bonfire of the carcasses.</p> <p>It is, to be sure, a medieval image, those piles of animal corpses being put to the flame - the pictures in the papers looking more like tapestries than photographs. And the panic is real. Farmers, already reeling after BSE and falling food prices, fear this could be the final blow. The Samaritans are on standby.</p> <p>The rest of the nation stands back, heeding the warnings to keep its distance. To urban folk, this whole scene looks like one of those 1950s sci-fi tales - Quatermass or Day of the Triffids. Sealed-off farms, a deadly virus, government warnings to stay away: all that's needed now is for the army to move in. But townies have two other reactions to the foot and mouth epidemic sweeping Britain - reactions which could be as decisive for the farmers' fate as the virus itself. Neither will bring much comfort.</p> <p>The first is confusion. Amid all the talk of European export bans, cancelled rugby matches and delayed general elections, plenty of people are still stuck on rather more basic questions. Like: what the hell is it? And: how might it affect me?</p> <p>I've heard people shouting at the radio and TV, demanding answers to those questions. BSE they could understand: they knew cows went mad, visibly stumbling and slobbering in TV footage played over and over again, and that humans could contract a terrifying and lethal version of the disease.</p> <p>Foot and mouth sounds so much simpler than bovine spongiform encephalopathy but my guess is that most non-rural folk remain baffled as to what it is. From the tone of the media coverage, and the end-of-the-world warnings from farmers, most Britons probably reckon F&amp;M is a killer disease which, once it touches a herd, rapidly wipes out the lot. As for humans, it's surely a death sentence to eat meat infected with the bug: your foot probably falls off and your mouth seizes up forever. Why else would government rules insist that infected animals be slaughtered instantly and the disease be eradicated so absolutely? It must be a merciless plague.</p> <p>Not quite. If human beings eat meat infected with F&amp;M, they do not die; at most they might get the odd cold sore. As for animals, foot and mouth rarely kills them either. Some of the herd's sick or young are vulnerable, but for most a bout of F&amp;M means little more than blisters around the mouth, on the teats and between the hooves, an occasional spot of lameness and a loss of appetite. The animal soon recovers and the whole thing lasts no more than two to three weeks.</p> <p>So why all the fuss? The clue is in that last symptom: loss of appetite. For a sheep with F&amp;M stops gaining weight, an infected cow produces less milk. The animal does not suffer or die - it just becomes less productive, yielding a less juicy lamb chop or fewer pints of milk. In an industry that has become ultra-intensive - squeezing every last drop of value from a sheep, pig or cow - even this slight loss of productivity can make the difference between profit and loss. Put simply, foot and mouth is an economic disease.</p> <p>A less-intensive brand of farming might take the old 19th-century attitude to F &amp;M: let it run. Back then, says agricultural historian Abigail Woods, who writes on the topic in today's Society section, \"no one took any notice of it at all, no one batted an eye-lid.\" Today's consumers wouldn't notice the difference either.</p> <p>But farmers can't just let foot and mouth come in, do its worst and blow away - even if that would be the most rational response. Foreign markets won't tolerate infected meat even if we would: the farmers' export trade would collapse. The law demands an extreme response too. A long outdated insistence that British meat be absolutely disease-free has led to the slaughter-on-sight policy, even when it is the emergency measures, not the virus itself, which really threatens farmers' livelihoods. The cure is worse than the disease.</p> <p>Still, don't expect too much sympathy from the rest of us. For if this outbreak has triggered our incomprehension of modern farming, it has also exposed our indifference to its plight. Typical of the urban mood was Ken Livingstone's instant response, calling on the Countryside Alliance to cancel its planned march on London. With an unerring instinct for popular feeling, the mayor guessed at most Londoners' attitude to the farmers: keep out, and take your mucky boots and strange germs with you. The Alliance duly called the event off.</p> <p>It's not hard to explain this urban chilliness toward the countryside. BSE was a turning point, breaking forever the cosy Farmer Giles myth of yore: suddenly Britons saw farms as giant agri-businesses, animal factories with profit the only motive. Never mind that many farmers didn't realise they were turning their livestock into cannibals: the trust was broken.</p> <p>The countryside's war on the Labour government has not helped. Not because they don't have a good case: the depletion of rural bus services and post offices is real. What turns townies off is that country folk never marched on London about any of those concerns: it was only when Labour moved against foxhunting that the countryside got organised. If the Alliance had been formed to save village schools, rather than the right to kill foxes, perhaps they would have enjoyed wider sympathy.</p> <p>There's one more cause of the town's cold shoulder to the country and it's an irony. For it was Conservative governments - the farmers' party - who per suaded Britons that if an industry is uneconomic, then it must go, even if that destroys communities and their way of life. Pit villages made that plea in the 1980s but no one listened - least of all the farmers who kept voting Tory. Yet now they insist that Britain must subsidise their industry, even if we could import their product more cheaply from abroad. If that logic couldn't save the miners, why should it save them?</p> <p>The farmers will argue that food is a special case. Britons, they reckon, remember the war - where we had to feed ourselves to stay alive. But few hold to that logic anymore: that's why Thatcherism didn't mind savaging our steel industry, even though we might need that one day to arm ourselves.

      "bodyText": "The flames turning the night sky orange, the stench of burning flesh - no wonder the talk in the countryside is of apocalypse. \"We are on the threshold of Armageddon,\" warns the National Farmers Union man in Devon, girding himself for another night of slaughter, another bonfire of the carcasses. It is, to be sure, a medieval image, those piles of animal corpses being put to the flame - the pictures in the papers looking more like tapestries than photographs. And the panic is real. Farmers, already reeling after BSE and falling food prices, fear this could be the final blow. The Samaritans are on standby. The rest of the nation stands back, heeding the warnings to keep its distance. To urban folk, this whole scene looks like one of those 1950s sci-fi tales - Quatermass or Day of the Triffids. Sealed-off farms, a deadly virus, government warnings to stay away: all that's needed now is for the army to move in. But townies have two other reactions to the foot and mouth epidemic sweeping Britain - reactions which could be as decisive for the farmers' fate as the virus itself. Neither will bring much comfort. The first is confusion. Amid all the talk of European export bans, cancelled rugby matches and delayed general elections, plenty of people are still stuck on rather more basic questions. Like: what the hell is it? And: how might it affect me? I've heard people shouting at the radio and TV, demanding answers to those questions. BSE they could understand: they knew cows went mad, visibly stumbling and slobbering in TV footage played over and over again, and that humans could contract a terrifying and lethal version of the disease. Foot and mouth sounds so much simpler than bovine spongiform encephalopathy but my guess is that most non-rural folk remain baffled as to what it is. From the tone of the media coverage, and the end-of-the-world warnings from farmers, most Britons probably reckon F&amp;M is a killer disease which, once it touches a herd, rapidly wipes out the lot. As for humans, it's surely a death sentence to eat meat infected with the bug: your foot probably falls off and your mouth seizes up forever. Why else would government rules insist that infected animals be slaughtered instantly and the disease be eradicated so absolutely? It must be a merciless plague. Not quite. If human beings eat meat infected with F&amp;M, they do not die; at most they might get the odd cold sore. As for animals, foot and mouth rarely kills them either. Some of the herd's sick or young are vulnerable, but for most a bout of F&amp;M means little more than blisters around the mouth, on the teats and between the hooves, an occasional spot of lameness and a loss of appetite. The animal soon recovers and the whole thing lasts no more than two to three weeks. So why all the fuss? The clue is in that last symptom: loss of appetite. For a sheep with F&amp;M stops gaining weight, an infected cow produces less milk. The animal does not suffer or die - it just becomes less productive, yielding a less juicy lamb chop or fewer pints of milk. In an industry that has become ultra-intensive - squeezing every last drop of value from a sheep, pig or cow - even this slight loss of productivity can make the difference between profit and loss. Put simply, foot and mouth is an economic disease. A less-intensive brand of farming might take the old 19th-century attitude to F &amp;M: let it run. Back then, says agricultural historian Abigail Woods, who writes on the topic in today's Society section, \"no one took any notice of it at all, no one batted an eye-lid.\" Today's consumers wouldn't notice the difference either. But farmers can't just let foot and mouth come in, do its worst and blow away - even if that would be the most rational response. Foreign markets won't tolerate infected meat even if we would: the farmers' export trade would collapse. The law demands an extreme response too. A long outdated insistence that British meat be absolutely disease-free has led to the slaughter-on-sight policy, even when it is the emergency measures, not the virus itself, which really threatens farmers' livelihoods. The cure is worse than the disease. Still, don't expect too much sympathy from the rest of us. For if this outbreak has triggered our incomprehension of modern farming, it has also exposed our indifference to its plight. Typical of the urban mood was Ken Livingstone's instant response, calling on the Countryside Alliance to cancel its planned march on London. With an unerring instinct for popular feeling, the mayor guessed at most Londoners' attitude to the farmers: keep out, and take your mucky boots and strange germs with you. The Alliance duly called the event off. It's not hard to explain this urban chilliness toward the countryside. BSE was a turning point, breaking forever the cosy Farmer Giles myth of yore: suddenly Britons saw farms as giant agri-businesses, animal factories with profit the only motive. Never mind that many farmers didn't realise they were turning their livestock into cannibals: the trust was broken. The countryside's war on the Labour government has not helped. Not because they don't have a good case: the depletion of rural bus services and post offices is real. What turns townies off is that country folk never marched on London about any of those concerns: it was only when Labour moved against foxhunting that the countryside got organised. If the Alliance had been formed to save village schools, rather than the right to kill foxes, perhaps they would have enjoyed wider sympathy. There's one more cause of the town's cold shoulder to the country and it's an irony. For it was Conservative governments - the farmers' party - who per suaded Britons that if an industry is uneconomic, then it must go, even if that destroys communities and their way of life. Pit villages made that plea in the 1980s but no one listened - least of all the farmers who kept voting Tory. Yet now they insist that Britain must subsidise their industry, even if we could import their product more cheaply from abroad. If that logic couldn't save the miners, why should it save them? The farmers will argue that food is a special case. Britons, they reckon, remember the war - where we had to feed ourselves to stay alive. But few hold to that logic anymore: that's why Thatcherism didn't mind savaging our steel industry, even though we might need that one day to arm ourselves. No, it's a globalised world now; Britons won't mind filling their shopping trolleys from abroad. They do so already. That sounds harsh and it is. It also lets us off the hook too easily. For if farmers have been driven to ever more intensive methods, it's partly to satisfy our demand for cheap food. As the novelist Jonathan Coe, whose What a Carve Up! skewered the food industry in the mid-90s, told me yesterday, \"absolute consumer choice\" comes at a terrible price - and it is the farmers now facing ruin who seem set to pay it. So Frederick Forsyth can hint darkly in the Daily Mail that the foot and mouth virus was introduced deliberately, as a Labour plot against the countryside. But most Britons know better. They know that if farmers are reaping a bitter harvest now, they - and we - sowed much of it ourselves. jonathan.freedland@theguardian.com",

Surprisingly, it is likable, wise and often right, the more so in tending to contradict The Intellectuals and the Masses, which had none of these qualities. The enemy has stayed the same - roughly, overweening literary Modernism. Has Carey's curious Oxonian populism truly changed, or just, as it were, moved colleges?</p> <p>The Intellectuals and the Masses was the most lucid and intelligent statement yet of an English conservative anti-Modernism familiar to readers of the Sunday Times and the Spectator. Carey's cousins in populism sometimes include Simon Jenkins, Paul Johnson, AN Wilson and the late Auberon Waugh. An easy moralism animates this worldview. Picasso was a pig; Edmund Gosse was \"a bore\"; DH Lawrence hit Frieda and wanted to exterminate whole races; Virginia Woolf was a pretentious snob who said horrible things about the plebeian Joyce, and about the girls who worked at Woolworths; James Kelman acted like a barbarian at the Booker dinner, and so on.</p> <p>Most of these commentators imagine themselves to be writing a form of intellectual history when they are only pouring gossip into fancy goblets at London book parties. They experience apparently no squeamishness, indeed no awareness of any difficulty, in moving between these troublesome lives and the troublesome work that was produced by them: the one naturally follows the other, as the overnight cell follows the police blotter. Robert Lowell was a rather unsavoury fellow; therefore we should not be surprised by the \"irresponsible obscurity\" (Carey's phrase) of his verse. In The Intellectuals and the Masses, Carey moves swiftly from quoting unpleasant and fascistic comments about the masses by Yeats, Eliot, Woolf, Hamsun, Lawrence and others - most of those comments appearing in diaries, letters and journalism - to the conclusion that \"the early 20th century saw a determined effort, on the part of the European intelligentsia, to exclude the masses from culture. In England this movement has become known as Modernism . . . Realism of the sort it was assumed the masses appreciated was abandoned. So was logical coherence. Irrationality and obscurity were cultivated.\"</p> <p>That art demands a scandalous selfishness, and a selfishness which paradoxically isolates the writer from the much less selfish world that is his or her subject, that most serious artists do not live orderly lives, do not merely chew the cud of convention, and are given to not very nice statements, seems to be a surprise only to these commentators. Even the beloved Chekhov, we now know, talked occasionally about 'Yids', and serially trifled with the affections of female admirers. Carey was indeed defeated even on his own terms a few months after the publication of The Intellectuals and the Masses in 1992. He ended his assault on the nasty Modernists by applauding the fact that in contemporary poetry \"obscurity is no longer the rule . . . The leading poets writing English in the second half of the 20th century, Larkin, Hughes and Heaney, have all written poems that . . . can be readily appreciated by schoolchildren.\" That was July: in the autumn came the revelation of Larkin's letters, containing heaped unpleasantnesses beyond anything in Woolf's diaries or Lawrence's letters, and the link between vile private statement and lovable public work became suddenly problematic - at least, to those for whom the problem was sudden.</p> <p>Of course, Modernism is in some ways a false quarry, since it hardly invented the monstrosity of the will-to-greatness, or the artist's certainty of superiority. Balzac, in Cousin Bette, distinguishes Wenceslas Steinbock, the talented demi-artist, from the real thing in a marvellous passage which also plentifully insults the masses, whom Balzac calls 'blockheads'. The demi-artists, he says,</p> <p>\"appear superior to real artists, who are taxed with aloofness, unsociability, rebellion against the conventions and civilised living; because great men belong to their creations. The entire detachment from all worldly concerns of true artists, and their devotion to their work, stamp them as egoists in the eyes of fools, who think that such men ought to go dressed like men about town performing the gyration that they call 'their social duties'. People would like to see the lions of Atlas combed and scented like a marchioness's lapdogs. Such men, who have few peers and rarely meet them, grow accustomed to shutting out the world, in their habit of solitude. They become incomprehensible to the majority, which, as we know, is composed of blockheads, the envious, ignoramuses, and skaters upon the surfaces of life.\"</p> <p>This was written in 1846 or 1847, and exceeds any late romantic hauteur expressed by Virginia Woolf. It also decouples Carey's connection between artistic disdain of the populace and an obscurity of style that must then exclude that populace.</p> <p>Still, to be fair, if we take Flaubert as the first Modernist, some kind of revolution seems to have occurred in the writer's relation to his reading public, and a new fear and hatred of the massed bourgeoisie arisen. Modern writers became much more likely to deliver themselves of blasphemies, misanthropic asides, snobberies of various kinds. Carey is very exercised by Nietzsche (\"a desperately restricted and unfulfilled human being . . . he ridicules the very concept of morality\") and lays at his door much of the proto-Nazism of Modernism. But Nietzsche, properly understood, should complicate Carey's prejudices. Nietzsche ends Beyond Good and Evil by chastising his own thoughts for beginning to look like truths, \"so pathetically righteous, so boring! . . . my old beloved wicked thoughts\". 'Wicked thoughts' - there is an admission here of a certain provisionality, a sense of necessary rebellion, a rhetoric being tested for the first time.</p> <p>What demanded rebellion? Carey never asks the question. It was not simply a matter of deciding that the masses were horrible and then devising an art that would exclude them. Doesn't the example of Madame Bovary suggest, to the contrary, that Modernism's anxiety had to do with a recognition that the masses were now an inevitable component of modern art, that art would have to depict them and then be read and judged by them? Diderot had not had to worry about 'a reading public', because it did not exist; but for whom was Flaubert writing Madame Bovary? Was it not for the very people who would condemn it? The 'blockheads'? Carey's terms, quite apart from their simplicity, assume that modern art had nothing to fear from a new mass reading public, that it was always a matter of the unpleasant Modernists ganging up on the suburban clerks, rather than the other way round.</p> <p>Carey properly dislikes Modernism's tendency to generalise about the masses; Woolf, he says, never saw the ordinary individual, only a lower class. And he has written splendidly about Arnold Bennett and the way that novelist cherished social ordinariness. But his own idea of the masses is of course a generalisation, too. \"Realism of the sort it was assumed the masses appreciated was abandoned,\" he writes - an assumption not unlike many of those he imputes to Modernism. But it is Carey who has decided that the masses can only understand simple realism; by contrast, it was Modernism that so anxiously desired (and feared) the reading public's comprehension of its new radical techniques. Carey praises Joyce for bothering to create that ordinary hero, Bloom, but finds that he must condemn Ulysses because \"Bloom himself would never and could never have read Ulysses or a book like Ulysses. The complexity of the novel, its avant-garde technique, its obscurity, rigorously exclude people like Bloom from its readership. More than almost any other 20th-century novel, it is for intellectuals only.\"</p> <p>But who is deciding that a man like Bloom 'would never and could never' appreciate Ulysses? Joyce, who like every artist wants the largest readership? Or Carey? This is merely elitism in populism's clothing. In Carey's generalisation, the masses can do no wrong. But modern art was partly a rebellion against massification because the masses were believed to incarnate and enforce generalising conformities. Modern artists, when they generalised about the masses, were generalising about what they feared was itself a new generalising force in society. This is contradictory, perhaps, and often it took unpleasant forms, but it is not necessarily incoherent, or even wrong. (Tocqueville had feared the same about the conformities of American democracy.) Nietzsche was not just thumbing his nose at the masses for the fun of it. He believed that the 'herd morality' of Christianity enslaved the masses, was unfair to them, because it turned 'free spirits' into a mass: \"all these moralities . . . all baroque and unreasonable in form, because they address themselves to 'all', because they generalise where generalisation is impermissible\", he writes in Beyond Good and Evil - this is a version of Carey's own argument in The Intellectuals and the Masses.</p> <p>The 'unpleasantness' of modern art can't be detached from the modernity of blasphemy. It was Christianity that had condemned the massa damnata; \"the whole lump of mankind is under the condemnation of Adam's sinne,\" Donne writes in a sermon from 1620. The secular condemnations of the masses, by Nietzsche or Lawrence or C\u00e9line, are at once repetitions and blasphemous inversions of Christianity's summary judgments. There is not just 'pride and prejudice' in this (Carey's subtitle is Pride and Prejudice among the Literary Intelligentsia, 1880-1939), but a rage at mass enslavement, and a rebellion against it. C\u00e9line, watching 'the bloated molluscs' who toil in Wall Street, or Eliot the dead who walk over London Bridge, are complaining about a modern world that kills people by turning them into masses. Carey would doubtless reply that they are not enslaved, and it is not the Modernist's right to say so. But his is merely one elitism trying to correct another: what right has Carey's elitist optimism over the elitist pessimism of Modernism? And which is necessarily the more sympathetic vision, the one that complains about their enslavement and offers them, however complicatedly, Modernist art, or the one that assumes they are not enslaved and offers them easy realist art, because that is 'assumed' to be what they like?</p> <p>Mass enslavement did, indeed, become a real threat, and not just to artists, in the 1930s. Carey's populism sees only gentle Wellsian cyclists, not blackshirts. But Karl Kraus and Joseph Roth had something to fear from their masses. When Thomas Mann condemns \"the vulgarity of Hitler' and laments, in his diaries, the 'wretched, isolated, demented people, misled by a wild and stupid band of adventurers whom they take for mythical heroes\", is this an example of literary pride and prejudice or of the saving distinction of the refined and sceptical artist?</p> <p>So much for English philistinism. But John Carey is not a philistine, and Pure Pleasure, which discusses 50 20th-century books that Carey has enjoyed, is itself a very pleasurable book. Carey's populism differs from the establishment populism of a Paul Johnson not simply because Carey is actually an intellectual but because his complaints vibrate with an appealing, nonconformist, almost Leavis-like outrage. He truly dislikes, and helps us to dislike with him, the bleating toffs, the scented scribe agonising over his weightless sonnet, the glassy metropolitan snobs, the varsity idlers in their pleated gowns - in short, what Larkin once called \"the shit in his shuttered ch\u00e2teau\". He may be a limited and biased reader of Woolf's rousing, anti-Edwardian manifesto for the examination of consciousness in fiction, 'Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown', but the surly provincial in me - dare I say it, my inner Lawrence - can hardly help cheering when he writes: \"The essay was originally delivered as a paper to a Cambridge undergraduate society, and it reverberates with the mirth of upper-class young people contemplating the sordid lives of their social inferiors. One can almost hear the well-bred laughter as Woolf impersonates Arnold Bennett planning a fictional character.\"</p> <p>You might argue that Woolf originally wrote this essay for an American paper, in 1923, and delivered a longer version of it ('Character in Fiction') a year later, and that its snobberies therefore have not much to do with its later, Cambridge audience. You might note that the essay was itself a response to a negative review by Bennett of Jacob's Room, in which the senior novelist complained that Woolf's characters were not 'real', while - she later mocked this - the character of Sherlock Holmes, he felt, was. You might agree with Carey that Woolf misrepresents Bennett's art, while feeling that her attack on the 'materialism' of the Edwardian novelists is more complicated, and simply more just, than Carey will ever allow. You might note, as Carey never does, that when Bennett died Woolf remarked, in her diary, not only on his lovability, but on his 'real understanding power' as well as his 'gigantic absorbing power' as an artist.</p> <p>Reading Woolf's essay with these things in mind, I do not hear the sounds of upper-class mirth that Carey detects. But I have heard them elsewhere in life, and like every reader of Woolf, have heard them elsewhere in her writings. And though it is a bit affected when Carey, in his new book, talks about 'book snobs' and 'the literati' (\"the literati used to scorn Kipling for his imperialism\"), and one thinks he is putting it on when he writes, in defence of Edward Thomas, that \"he is a poet of Englishness, and this has earned him the contempt of intellectuals\" (this is like those cultural materialists who try to convince their readers that EMW Tillyard's The Elizabethan World Picture is still a dominant text), and one feels he is being absurd when he favours Katherine Mansfield over Woolf only because, \"as a 'colonial' and a banker's daughter Mansfield knew what it was to be cold-shouldered by the literati\" - despite all this, one feels an attractive spirit of partisanship in Carey's writing, an alliance with the ordinary, the plain-spoken, the unlettered, the sympathetic and the humane. Carey writes with an Orwellian attention to 'decency'; the oddity is merely that this pitchfork prodder is the Merton Professor of English.</p> <p>But again, this is not an unattractive oddity. It is not nonsensical to seek in literature, especially in fiction, a humane attention to the details of ordinary life. Think of Flaubert and Chekhov. In Madame Bovary, as countless readers have experienced, one feels that, for all the novel's greatness, the characters are doomed, while in Chekhov we feel that they are merely imprisoned. We feel that Flaubert is, finally, disgusted, mortified (and the religious emphasis is exact) by his foolish bourgeois subjects, while Chekhov loves his characters. If realism was a modern stylistic agony for Flaubert, it was a moral necessity for Chekhov; if Flaubert retained and aestheticised religious judgment, Chekhov paganised life; if Flaubert's people are all mistakes, Chekhov's are all forgiven. Chekhov, to my mind, is the more humane artist, and, for all the difficulty of holding writers' lives to account, it would be a severe disappointment for me to learn that Chekhov the man was considerably less humane than his work.</p> <p>One instinctively knows, therefore, what Carey means when he writes of Kipling, one of the authors he selects in Pure Pleasure, that he</p> <p>was no ordinary imperialist. He cared for the individual caught up in the system. His obsessive mimicry is a facet of this. The speakers in these stories include a Yankee gun-runner, a Sikh cavalry trooper, several British squaddies and naval personnel of various ranks, all pouring out their different brands of slang, jargon and technical know-how. The effect is to give each a distinctive presence, and that is crucial. Kipling's art reveals what is special about seemingly nondescript people. The implications are democratic. . . . Menials and underdogs in these stories repeatedly perform better than those in command. A boatload of misfits outmanoeuvres the top brass of the Channel Fleet. A humble Tommy vanquishes a young Boer toff, whose jeering voice reminds him of the squire back home. Kipling's estimate of the British Army was \"brainy men languishing under an effete system\". That went for British society too.</p> <p>This is not academic criticism; it is barely literary journalism. It is really popular communication. But it has a moral power. Pure Pleasure is a compilation of Carey's Sunday Times series, John Carey's Books of the Century, thousand-word pieces, appearing weekly, in which he selected a 20th-century book he liked and recommended it to his readers. He deliberately chose, he tells us, not the \"thumping masterpieces', but \"less trumpeted and less familiar favourites by the same authors (Joyce's Portrait, not Ulysses; DH Lawrence's Twilight in Italy, not the novels) . . . Books which I do not like, or have never been able to finish, were naturally omitted (no Proust, no Faulkner).\" He chose the books not on grounds of literary greatness, but \"took pure reading-pleasure as my criterion - the pleasure the books have given to me, and the pleasure I hope others will get from being reminded of them, or perhaps introduced to them\".</p> <p>There is a politics here, as well as an aesthetics. Again and again, books are recommended because they warn against literature and literariness. Carey likes A Room with a View for the way it delineates English \"priggishness, snobbery and custom . . . A Room with a View is a book that warns against books, or against too much trust in them.\" He writes warmly - and very well - of The Old Wives' Tale, for the way Bennett shows \"how important the small and the ordinary are to us\". The History of Mr Polly is \"a novel of social protest\". There is the stubbornly English Edward Thomas, beset by contemptuous 'intellectuals'; and the cold-shouldered Katherine Mansfield. He chooses Hasek's great novel The Good Soldier Svejk, and writes very appealingly about it - and should perhaps have mentioned that Kundera calls it, in The Art of the Novel, \"perhaps the last great popular novel\". Of Huxley's Those Barren Leaves, Carey writes that \"beneath this sparkling surface . . . an anti-novel gradually accumulates.\" Lucky Jim is defended against the charge of philistinism: Jim Dixon \"hates the possessors of culture rather than culture itself\". Carey even tries to make a radical populist case for Decline and Fall, because \"it satirises the aristocrats and those who kow-tow to them\", and because when Waugh was at Oxford, \"he felt inferior because he was just a suburban publisher's son, without wealth or title.\" (That this might tell us something unpleasant about Waugh's snobbish social sensitivities and aspirations, that it might actually constitute a case against the untitled boy from Hampstead - poor, deprived suburb - does not occur to Carey, so eager is he to co-opt Waugh, as it were, onto the editorial board of Scrutiny.) The book's final selection is Graham Swift's Last Orders. Carey writes appreciatively of the way Swift captures Cockney speech and ends powerfully: \"If a language reflects the temper of its people, we should be proud of this book's language - or proud of the generation, now passing, that spoke it.\"</p> <p>Of course, there are crudities of thought and argument. If high literature is so often arguing against itself, or written by people who do not come from the polished upper classes, then at what point should one stop making such a petit-bourgeois fuss about its 'literariness' and simply concede that it is not so high and precious after all, and is in fact largely written by the petite bourgeoisie (Dickens, Hardy, George Eliot)? I don't think, as Carey does, that Elizabeth Bowen 'goes beyond' Henry James (whom Carey doesn't seem to like) in her ability to depict inner thought and feeling, and I am unable to make sense of his claim that Lucky Jim represents \"one of the first attempts in English to describe women realistically\". But for all that, this is a wide selection, which includes Joyce, and Eliot's 'Prufrock', and Mann's The Confessions of Felix Krull. There are wise insights into Auden's poems, The Secret Agent, Gorky's memoir of his childhood, The Tin Drum, Sartre's memoir Words, and Sylvia Townsend Warner's Mr Fortune's Maggot. This last novel was new to me; there are surely few readers who will not learn something from Pure Pleasure.</p> <p>This is not, then, the face of English philistinism. Besides, we know that there is a literature of the kind Kipling wrote, in which the thoughts and drifting fantasies of people whom the novel had not previously tended to bother with, or had indeed apologised for briefly considering, were newly allowed to flourish. In The Longest Journey, Forster writes archly that Mr Ansell was a \"provincial draper of moderate prosperity\" who ought to be classed \"with those phenomena that are not really there\". But it is not only Arnold Bennett who would attend to Mr Ansell. Think not only of Chekhov, but of the Italian verismo of Giovanni Verga, the simple Sicilian stories of Pirandello, and of Pavese's novels; or of Dreiser's Sister Carrie and An American Tragedy; of Bohumil Hrabal; of Christina Stead; of Henry Green's Loving; or of VS Pritchett's short stories - Pritchett, who was told by HG Wells in the 1930s that the working classes could not be written about without comedy and condescension. All these writers thought Mr Ansell worthy of being classed with those phenomena that are really there. Carey, as it happens, does not include any of these writers, and his selection sometimes hugs the English coast a bit greedily (he might have given a place to Confessions of Zeno, that marvellous comedy admired by Arnold Bennett). But the humane and gentle spirit of these writers is instinct with the spirit which animates his lively pieces about Kipling, Gorky, Hasek, Edward Thomas, Orwell and Heaney.</p> <p>How strangely this little book contradicts the snarling Intellectuals and the Masses, and not just in tone. Forster, Eliot and Lawrence, enemies in the earlier book, are favourites here. About Lawrence's superb but unstable Twilight in Italy, Carey notes without sarcasm that for Lawrence the trip represents \"an escape from the guilt and repression of the Christian North to the warmth of the pagan South\". Where is Nietzsche when you need him? He even seems to enjoy - and they are enjoyable - Lawrence's frenzies of abolition in this book: \"His prose is lulling, incantatory, and he loves or hates the people he meets with passionate arbitrariness.\" Orwell's Coming up for Air, which in the last book was used as an example of the intellectuals' hostility to the creeping suburbs, is here welcomed.</p> <p>Above all, Carey demonstrates quite clearly what he was unwilling to admit in The Intellectuals and the Masses: that works of literature are variegated and disruptive, that they are frequently self-divided, that they may rebel against the ideologies of their creators and that they can't be pillaged for compliant quotations. It is just this that Carey seems to discover about Brighton Rock, a novel he used in his last book as an example of Modernist hauteur - constructed, he wrote, \"around the idea that by comparison with Catholics ordinary mass mankind does not truly exist at all. Loathing of what the masses have done to England reverberates throughout the novel.\" But in Pure Pleasure, Carey argues that \"the more Greene heaps insult on Ida\" - the brassy barmaid - \"the more the novel turns against him . . . Pinkie, too, refuses to become the character his creator planned . . . So the novel was saved by its characters from Greene's intentions.\"</p> <p>Of course, people aren't hurt by aesthetics; to get round this awkwardness in The Intellectuals and the Masses, Carey had to convert the aesthetic into the moral, and make novels sound as if they were propositional arguments. But in a book devoted to the idea of the most 'pleasurable' works of art, the aesthetic always threatens to return: how else do we assess 'pleasure'? Carey tries to bury aesthetics - the aesthetic, in his world, always leads to art-for-art's sake and Modernist preciousness - by bluffly referring only to \"pure reading-pleasure\". So it is endearing to see Carey helplessly readmitting the aesthetic from time to time; as when he praises The Secret Agent for the coiled ironies of its style: \"it is a supreme literary artefact\"; or as, when he answers his own question about why one should read Updike's Rabbit novels, by saying: \"Updike's writing is why. Each page is a cascade of delicately caught sense impressions.\"</p> <p>If Carey at times seems unsure who exactly his readers are (do they like Thomas Mann or Kingsley Amis?) and who exactly his enemies are, if he swerves between easy and more difficult pleasures, and between aesthetics and politics, he is, in a sense, only re-enacting Modernism's very anxieties - though this may be too much for Carey to admit, even in his fine, all-pleasuring new mood.</p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\">LRB</a>.

Irrationality and obscurity were cultivated.\" That art demands a scandalous selfishness, and a selfishness which paradoxically isolates the writer from the much less selfish world that is his or her subject, that most serious artists do not live orderly lives, do not merely chew the cud of convention, and are given to not very nice statements, seems to be a surprise only to these commentators. Even the beloved Chekhov, we now know, talked occasionally about 'Yids', and serially trifled with the affections of female admirers. Carey was indeed defeated even on his own terms a few months after the publication of The Intellectuals and the Masses in 1992. He ended his assault on the nasty Modernists by applauding the fact that in contemporary poetry \"obscurity is no longer the rule . . . The leading poets writing English in the second half of the 20th century, Larkin, Hughes and Heaney, have all written poems that . . . can be readily appreciated by schoolchildren.\" That was July: in the autumn came the revelation of Larkin's letters, containing heaped unpleasantnesses beyond anything in Woolf's diaries or Lawrence's letters, and the link between vile private statement and lovable public work became suddenly problematic - at least, to those for whom the problem was sudden. Of course, Modernism is in some ways a false quarry, since it hardly invented the monstrosity of the will-to-greatness, or the artist's certainty of superiority. Balzac, in Cousin Bette, distinguishes Wenceslas Steinbock, the talented demi-artist, from the real thing in a marvellous passage which also plentifully insults the masses, whom Balzac calls 'blockheads'. The demi-artists, he says, \"appear superior to real artists, who are taxed with aloofness, unsociability, rebellion against the conventions and civilised living; because great men belong to their creations. The entire detachment from all worldly concerns of true artists, and their devotion to their work, stamp them as egoists in the eyes of fools, who think that such men ought to go dressed like men about town performing the gyration that they call 'their social duties'. People would like to see the lions of Atlas combed and scented like a marchioness's lapdogs. Such men, who have few peers and rarely meet them, grow accustomed to shutting out the world, in their habit of solitude. They become incomprehensible to the majority, which, as we know, is composed of blockheads, the envious, ignoramuses, and skaters upon the surfaces of life.\" This was written in 1846 or 1847, and exceeds any late romantic hauteur expressed by Virginia Woolf. It also decouples Carey's connection between artistic disdain of the populace and an obscurity of style that must then exclude that populace. Still, to be fair, if we take Flaubert as the first Modernist, some kind of revolution seems to have occurred in the writer's relation to his reading public, and a new fear and hatred of the massed bourgeoisie arisen. Modern writers became much more likely to deliver themselves of blasphemies, misanthropic asides, snobberies of various kinds. Carey is very exercised by Nietzsche (\"a desperately restricted and unfulfilled human being . . . he ridicules the very concept of morality\") and lays at his door much of the proto-Nazism of Modernism. But Nietzsche, properly understood, should complicate Carey's prejudices. Nietzsche ends Beyond Good and Evil by chastising his own thoughts for beginning to look like truths, \"so pathetically righteous, so boring! . . . my old beloved wicked thoughts\". 'Wicked thoughts' - there is an admission here of a certain provisionality, a sense of necessary rebellion, a rhetoric being tested for the first time. What demanded rebellion? Carey never asks the question. It was not simply a matter of deciding that the masses were horrible and then devising an art that would exclude them. Doesn't the example of Madame Bovary suggest, to the contrary, that Modernism's anxiety had to do with a recognition that the masses were now an inevitable component of modern art, that art would have to depict them and then be read and judged by them? Diderot had not had to worry about 'a reading public', because it did not exist; but for whom was Flaubert writing Madame Bovary? Was it not for the very people who would condemn it? The 'blockheads'? Carey's terms, quite apart from their simplicity, assume that modern art had nothing to fear from a new mass reading public, that it was always a matter of the unpleasant Modernists ganging up on the suburban clerks, rather than the other way round. Carey properly dislikes Modernism's tendency to generalise about the masses; Woolf, he says, never saw the ordinary individual, only a lower class. And he has written splendidly about Arnold Bennett and the way that novelist cherished social ordinariness. But his own idea of the masses is of course a generalisation, too. \"Realism of the sort it was assumed the masses appreciated was abandoned,\" he writes - an assumption not unlike many of those he imputes to Modernism. But it is Carey who has decided that the masses can only understand simple realism; by contrast, it was Modernism that so anxiously desired (and feared) the reading public's comprehension of its new radical techniques. Carey praises Joyce for bothering to create that ordinary hero, Bloom, but finds that he must condemn Ulysses because \"Bloom himself would never and could never have read Ulysses or a book like Ulysses. The complexity of the novel, its avant-garde technique, its obscurity, rigorously exclude people like Bloom from its readership. More than almost any other 20th-century novel, it is for intellectuals only.\" But who is deciding that a man like Bloom 'would never and could never' appreciate Ulysses? Joyce, who like every artist wants the largest readership? Or Carey? This is merely elitism in populism's clothing. In Carey's generalisation, the masses can do no wrong. But modern art was partly a rebellion against massification because the masses were believed to incarnate and enforce generalising conformities. Modern artists, when they generalised about the masses, were generalising about what they feared was itself a new generalising force in society. This is contradictory, perhaps, and often it took unpleasant forms, but it is not necessarily incoherent, or even wrong. (Tocqueville had feared the same about the conformities of American democracy.) Nietzsche was not just thumbing his nose at the masses for the fun of it. He believed that the 'herd morality' of Christianity enslaved the masses, was unfair to them, because it turned 'free spirits' into a mass: \"all these moralities . . . all baroque and unreasonable in form, because they address themselves to 'all', because they generalise where generalisation is impermissible\", he writes in Beyond Good and Evil - this is a version of Carey's own argument in The Intellectuals and the Masses. The 'unpleasantness' of modern art can't be detached from the modernity of blasphemy. It was Christianity that had condemned the massa damnata; \"the whole lump of mankind is under the condemnation of Adam's sinne,\" Donne writes in a sermon from 1620. The secular condemnations of the masses, by Nietzsche or Lawrence or C\u00e9line, are at once repetitions and blasphemous inversions of Christianity's summary judgments. There is not just 'pride and prejudice' in this (Carey's subtitle is Pride and Prejudice among the Literary Intelligentsia, 1880-1939), but a rage at mass enslavement, and a rebellion against it. C\u00e9line, watching 'the bloated molluscs' who toil in Wall Street, or Eliot the dead who walk over London Bridge, are complaining about a modern world that kills people by turning them into masses. Carey would doubtless reply that they are not enslaved, and it is not the Modernist's right to say so. But his is merely one elitism trying to correct another: what right has Carey's elitist optimism over the elitist pessimism of Modernism? And which is necessarily the more sympathetic vision, the one that complains about their enslavement and offers them, however complicatedly, Modernist art, or the one that assumes they are not enslaved and offers them easy realist art, because that is 'assumed' to be what they like? Mass enslavement did, indeed, become a real threat, and not just to artists, in the 1930s. Carey's populism sees only gentle Wellsian cyclists, not blackshirts. But Karl Kraus and Joseph Roth had something to fear from their masses. When Thomas Mann condemns \"the vulgarity of Hitler' and laments, in his diaries, the 'wretched, isolated, demented people, misled by a wild and stupid band of adventurers whom they take for mythical heroes\", is this an example of literary pride and prejudice or of the saving distinction of the refined and sceptical artist? So much for English philistinism. But John Carey is not a philistine, and Pure Pleasure, which discusses 50 20th-century books that Carey has enjoyed, is itself a very pleasurable book. Carey's populism differs from the establishment populism of a Paul Johnson not simply because Carey is actually an intellectual but because his complaints vibrate with an appealing, nonconformist, almost Leavis-like outrage. He truly dislikes, and helps us to dislike with him, the bleating toffs, the scented scribe agonising over his weightless sonnet, the glassy metropolitan snobs, the varsity idlers in their pleated gowns - in short, what Larkin once called \"the shit in his shuttered ch\u00e2teau\". He may be a limited and biased reader of Woolf's rousing, anti-Edwardian manifesto for the examination of consciousness in fiction, 'Mr Bennett and Mrs Brown', but the surly provincial in me - dare I say it, my inner Lawrence - can hardly help cheering when he writes: \"The essay was originally delivered as a paper to a Cambridge undergraduate society, and it reverberates with the mirth of upper-class young people contemplating the sordid lives of their social inferiors. One can almost hear the well-bred laughter as Woolf impersonates Arnold Bennett planning a fictional character.\" You might argue that Woolf originally wrote this essay for an American paper, in 1923, and delivered a longer version of it ('Character in Fiction') a year later, and that its snobberies therefore have not much to do with its later, Cambridge audience. You might note that the essay was itself a response to a negative review by Bennett of Jacob's Room, in which the senior novelist complained that Woolf's characters were not 'real', while - she later mocked this - the character of Sherlock Holmes, he felt, was. You might agree with Carey that Woolf misrepresents Bennett's art, while feeling that her attack on the 'materialism' of the Edwardian novelists is more complicated, and simply more just, than Carey will ever allow. You might note, as Carey never does, that when Bennett died Woolf remarked, in her diary, not only on his lovability, but on his 'real understanding power' as well as his 'gigantic absorbing power' as an artist. Reading Woolf's essay with these things in mind, I do not hear the sounds of upper-class mirth that Carey detects. But I have heard them elsewhere in life, and like every reader of Woolf, have heard them elsewhere in her writings. And though it is a bit affected when Carey, in his new book, talks about 'book snobs' and 'the literati' (\"the literati used to scorn Kipling for his imperialism\"), and one thinks he is putting it on when he writes, in defence of Edward Thomas, that \"he is a poet of Englishness, and this has earned him the contempt of intellectuals\" (this is like those cultural materialists who try to convince their readers that EMW Tillyard's The Elizabethan World Picture is still a dominant text), and one feels he is being absurd when he favours Katherine Mansfield over Woolf only because, \"as a 'colonial' and a banker's daughter Mansfield knew what it was to be cold-shouldered by the literati\" - despite all this, one feels an attractive spirit of partisanship in Carey's writing, an alliance with the ordinary, the plain-spoken, the unlettered, the sympathetic and the humane. Carey writes with an Orwellian attention to 'decency'; the oddity is merely that this pitchfork prodder is the Merton Professor of English. But again, this is not an unattractive oddity. It is not nonsensical to seek in literature, especially in fiction, a humane attention to the details of ordinary life. Think of Flaubert and Chekhov. In Madame Bovary, as countless readers have experienced, one feels that, for all the novel's greatness, the characters are doomed, while in Chekhov we feel that they are merely imprisoned. We feel that Flaubert is, finally, disgusted, mortified (and the religious emphasis is exact) by his foolish bourgeois subjects, while Chekhov loves his characters. If realism was a modern stylistic agony for Flaubert, it was a moral necessity for Chekhov; if Flaubert retained and aestheticised religious judgment, Chekhov paganised life; if Flaubert's people are all mistakes, Chekhov's are all forgiven. Chekhov, to my mind, is the more humane artist, and, for all the difficulty of holding writers' lives to account, it would be a severe disappointment for me to learn that Chekhov the man was considerably less humane than his work. One instinctively knows, therefore, what Carey means when he writes of Kipling, one of the authors he selects in Pure Pleasure, that he was no ordinary imperialist. He cared for the individual caught up in the system. His obsessive mimicry is a facet of this. The speakers in these stories include a Yankee gun-runner, a Sikh cavalry trooper, several British squaddies and naval personnel of various ranks, all pouring out their different brands of slang, jargon and technical know-how. The effect is to give each a distinctive presence, and that is crucial. Kipling's art reveals what is special about seemingly nondescript people. The implications are democratic. . . . Menials and underdogs in these stories repeatedly perform better than those in command. A boatload of misfits outmanoeuvres the top brass of the Channel Fleet. A humble Tommy vanquishes a young Boer toff, whose jeering voice reminds him of the squire back home. Kipling's estimate of the British Army was \"brainy men languishing under an effete system\". That went for British society too. This is not academic criticism; it is barely literary journalism. It is really popular communication. But it has a moral power. Pure Pleasure is a compilation of Carey's Sunday Times series, John Carey's Books of the Century, thousand-word pieces, appearing weekly, in which he selected a 20th-century book he liked and recommended it to his readers. He deliberately chose, he tells us, not the \"thumping masterpieces', but \"less trumpeted and less familiar favourites by the same authors (Joyce's Portrait, not Ulysses; DH Lawrence's Twilight in Italy, not the novels) . . . Books which I do not like, or have never been able to finish, were naturally omitted (no Proust, no Faulkner).\" He chose the books not on grounds of literary greatness, but \"took pure reading-pleasure as my criterion - the pleasure the books have given to me, and the pleasure I hope others will get from being reminded of them, or perhaps introduced to them\". There is a politics here, as well as an aesthetics. Again and again, books are recommended because they warn against literature and literariness. Carey likes A Room with a View for the way it delineates English \"priggishness, snobbery and custom . . . A Room with a View is a book that warns against books, or against too much trust in them.\" He writes warmly - and very well - of The Old Wives' Tale, for the way Bennett shows \"how important the small and the ordinary are to us\". The History of Mr Polly is \"a novel of social protest\". There is the stubbornly English Edward Thomas, beset by contemptuous 'intellectuals'; and the cold-shouldered Katherine Mansfield. He chooses Hasek's great novel The Good Soldier Svejk, and writes very appealingly about it - and should perhaps have mentioned that Kundera calls it, in The Art of the Novel, \"perhaps the last great popular novel\". Of Huxley's Those Barren Leaves, Carey writes that \"beneath this sparkling surface . . . an anti-novel gradually accumulates.\" Lucky Jim is defended against the charge of philistinism: Jim Dixon \"hates the possessors of culture rather than culture itself\". Carey even tries to make a radical populist case for Decline and Fall, because \"it satirises the aristocrats and those who kow-tow to them\", and because when Waugh was at Oxford, \"he felt inferior because he was just a suburban publisher's son, without wealth or title.\" (That this might tell us something unpleasant about Waugh's snobbish social sensitivities and aspirations, that it might actually constitute a case against the untitled boy from Hampstead - poor, deprived suburb - does not occur to Carey, so eager is he to co-opt Waugh, as it were, onto the editorial board of Scrutiny.) The book's final selection is Graham Swift's Last Orders. Carey writes appreciatively of the way Swift captures Cockney speech and ends powerfully: \"If a language reflects the temper of its people, we should be proud of this book's language - or proud of the generation, now passing, that spoke it.\" Of course, there are crudities of thought and argument. If high literature is so often arguing against itself, or written by people who do not come from the polished upper classes, then at what point should one stop making such a petit-bourgeois fuss about its 'literariness' and simply concede that it is not so high and precious after all, and is in fact largely written by the petite bourgeoisie (Dickens, Hardy, George Eliot)? I don't think, as Carey does, that Elizabeth Bowen 'goes beyond' Henry James (whom Carey doesn't seem to like) in her ability to depict inner thought and feeling, and I am unable to make sense of his claim that Lucky Jim represents \"one of the first attempts in English to describe women realistically\". But for all that, this is a wide selection, which includes Joyce, and Eliot's 'Prufrock', and Mann's The Confessions of Felix Krull. There are wise insights into Auden's poems, The Secret Agent, Gorky's memoir of his childhood, The Tin Drum, Sartre's memoir Words, and Sylvia Townsend Warner's Mr Fortune's Maggot. This last novel was new to me; there are surely few readers who will not learn something from Pure Pleasure. This is not, then, the face of English philistinism. Besides, we know that there is a literature of the kind Kipling wrote, in which the thoughts and drifting fantasies of people whom the novel had not previously tended to bother with, or had indeed apologised for briefly considering, were newly allowed to flourish. In The Longest Journey, Forster writes archly that Mr Ansell was a \"provincial draper of moderate prosperity\" who ought to be classed \"with those phenomena that are not really there\". But it is not only Arnold Bennett who would attend to Mr Ansell. Think not only of Chekhov, but of the Italian verismo of Giovanni Verga, the simple Sicilian stories of Pirandello, and of Pavese's novels; or of Dreiser's Sister Carrie and An American Tragedy; of Bohumil Hrabal; of Christina Stead; of Henry Green's Loving; or of VS Pritchett's short stories - Pritchett, who was told by HG Wells in the 1930s that the working classes could not be written about without comedy and condescension. All these writers thought Mr Ansell worthy of being classed with those phenomena that are really there. Carey, as it happens, does not include any of these writers, and his selection sometimes hugs the English coast a bit greedily (he might have given a place to Confessions of Zeno, that marvellous comedy admired by Arnold Bennett). But the humane and gentle spirit of these writers is instinct with the spirit which animates his lively pieces about Kipling, Gorky, Hasek, Edward Thomas, Orwell and Heaney. How strangely this little book contradicts the snarling Intellectuals and the Masses, and not just in tone. Forster, Eliot and Lawrence, enemies in the earlier book, are favourites here. About Lawrence's superb but unstable Twilight in Italy, Carey notes without sarcasm that for Lawrence the trip represents \"an escape from the guilt and repression of the Christian North to the warmth of the pagan South\". Where is Nietzsche when you need him? He even seems to enjoy - and they are enjoyable - Lawrence's frenzies of abolition in this book: \"His prose is lulling, incantatory, and he loves or hates the people he meets with passionate arbitrariness.\" Orwell's Coming up for Air, which in the last book was used as an example of the intellectuals' hostility to the creeping suburbs, is here welcomed. Above all, Carey demonstrates quite clearly what he was unwilling to admit in The Intellectuals and the Masses: that works of literature are variegated and disruptive, that they are frequently self-divided, that they may rebel against the ideologies of their creators and that they can't be pillaged for compliant quotations. It is just this that Carey seems to discover about Brighton Rock, a novel he used in his last book as an example of Modernist hauteur - constructed, he wrote, \"around the idea that by comparison with Catholics ordinary mass mankind does not truly exist at all. Loathing of what the masses have done to England reverberates throughout the novel.\" But in Pure Pleasure, Carey argues that \"the more Greene heaps insult on Ida\" - the brassy barmaid - \"the more the novel turns against him . . . Pinkie, too, refuses to become the character his creator planned . . . So the novel was saved by its characters from Greene's intentions.\" Of course, people aren't hurt by aesthetics; to get round this awkwardness in The Intellectuals and the Masses, Carey had to convert the aesthetic into the moral, and make novels sound as if they were propositional arguments. But in a book devoted to the idea of the most 'pleasurable' works of art, the aesthetic always threatens to return: how else do we assess 'pleasure'? Carey tries to bury aesthetics - the aesthetic, in his world, always leads to art-for-art's sake and Modernist preciousness - by bluffly referring only to \"pure reading-pleasure\". So it is endearing to see Carey helplessly readmitting the aesthetic from time to time; as when he praises The Secret Agent for the coiled ironies of its style: \"it is a supreme literary artefact\"; or as, when he answers his own question about why one should read Updike's Rabbit novels, by saying: \"Updike's writing is why. Each page is a cascade of delicately caught sense impressions.\" If Carey at times seems unsure who exactly his readers are (do they like Thomas Mann or Kingsley Amis?) and who exactly his enemies are, if he swerves between easy and more difficult pleasures, and between aesthetics and politics, he is, in a sense, only re-enacting Modernism's very anxieties - though this may be too much for Carey to admit, even in his fine, all-pleasuring new mood. \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

In recent weeks the Academy form of Cameron Crowe's coming-of-age comedy appeared to be losing ground to the likes of Crouching Tiger, Gladiator, Traffic and Erin Brockovich. But the Chicago honours could put it back in the running. Almost Famous took five awards - Best Film, Best Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Supporting Actress (for Frances McDormand) and Most Promising Actor (Patrick Fugit) - and Oscar favourite Gladiator was notable by its absence from the other main awards. Crouching Tiger won for Best Foreign Language Film, Best Cinematography, Best Original Score and Most Promising Actress (Zhang Ziyi). Ellen Burstyn was named Best Actress for her role in Requiem For a Dream, Tom Hanks Best Actor for Cast Away, while Benicio Del Toro scooped the Best Supporting Actor Award for Traffic.

However, Ms Robinson believed that Chinese officials were becoming \"very open to the need for change and reform\". A Chinese parliamentary committee is expected to vote on ratifying an important UN rights covenant today. Chinese officials claimed that the UN commissioner \"did not understand\" the threat posed by the Falun Gong. Jiang Wen, head of the government's \"anti-cult\" office, said that sect members in the re-education camps were han dled \"like doctors treat patients and parents treat children\". Ms Robinson said that the justice minister, Zhang Fusen, defended the system of imprisonment without trial which she was urging China to scrap, though Mr Zhang admitted that it \"could be improved\". The human rights dialogue coincides with a ritual exchange of denunciations between the US and China. The State Department's annual report on human rights abuses said that in 2000 \"[China's] poor human rights record worsened, and it continued to commit numerous serious abuses\". Beijing counterattacked yesterday by issuing a paper in which the Chinese State Council called American democracy \"a rich man's game\" in which the presidency could be sold to the highest bidder\". In spite of its negative tone, the State Department report contains several passages apparently written in by the Bush administration to put a better gloss on China's record. It noted that \"senior officials openly acknowledged abuses such as using torture to extort confessions\", and conceded that \"many Chinese [have] more individual choice [and] greater access to information.\" China issued awards this week to some 1,600 participants in the crackdown on the Falun Gong, claiming that it had won a \"great victory\" over the sect.

A property developer and man of sufficient heft to accommodate most of life's nasty surprises, he took some antibiotics and thought no more about it. That was on Friday. On Monday he was diagnosed with hepatitis A. On Tuesday he went into hepatic failure and was rushed to King's College hospital in London. By the end of the week, 41-year-old Needs was in a coma and his family had been summoned from Bedford to exchange final goodbyes. </p> <p>Over the next two days, Needs' life hung not on the skill of surgeons, but on the mobilisation of a small group of administrators on the outskirts of Bristol. The UK transplant centre is a two-storey building at the back of a business park. It takes several goes round the roundabout and a circuit of Sainsbury's car park to find it. \"I'm sure people read the sign and imagine we have freezers full of organs here,\" says Sue Sutherland, the centre's chief executive. Her 100-strong team coordinates every organ transplant in Britain, matching donors to patients. While accident and emergency wards scramble through the mire to save lives, the transplant centre executes its rescues in the atmosphere of a local reference library. </p> <p>Sutherland's team have a problem. Over the past 10 years, the number of organs available for transplant each year has fallen by roughly 1,000, and, though there is no evidence yet of a fall-off, there are fears that the Alder Hey scandal will deter potential donors. Hence the \u00a33m initiative launched yesterday by Alan Milburn, the health secretary, to double the number of people on the donation register. \"We want to reassure the public that there is a great difference between donating an organ for transplant and for postmortem,\" says Sutherland. </p> <p>Bernadette Porter can testify to that. On Saturday afternoon, while Simon Needs and his crew docked at Southampton, her 15-year-old son Paul was taking a walk 600 miles away, along a headland known as the Knab in Lerwick, Shetland. It is a beauty spot overlooking the North Sea, where Paul used to sledge in the winter and ramble in the summer. \"He was so fit and healthy, intelligent and beautiful,\" she says. \"He was really interested in science and thought it was awful that his dad and I didn't carry a donor card. He was quite determined to carry one himself.\" </p> <p>The grass was slippery that September day and, suddenly losing his footing, Paul fell 60 feet on to the rocks below. After a joint rescue operation by police, coastguards and the lifeboat service, he was taken to Lerwick's Gilbert Bain Hospital with serious head injuries, from where he was flown by air ambulance to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and put in intensive care. \"It took a week for him to die,\" says Porter. \"When the hospital asked if they could use his organs, I would have been horrified if Paul hadn't prepared me for it.\" </p> <p>The critical factor in all transplants is freshness: the shelf life of a kidney is 24 hours, a heart or lung six, a liver 18 to 20. Kidneys are the most in demand: of the 5,500 people on the active transplant waiting list, almost 5,000 of them are waiting for a kidney. By comparison, there are 150 or so people in the queue for a liver. Whatever the organ, judicious allocation must take place at the centre within two or three minutes of the hospital identifying a donor. \"A hospital's transplant coordinators will give us a ring after the patient's first brain-stem death test,\" says Sutherland. \"It's not until a patient has undergone two sets of tests that he is declared absolutely done for. At that point we would begin to think about where that organ is going to go.\" </p> <p>Simon Needs' condition was severe enough to shoot him to the top of the liver queue. Only two people a year get liver failure through hepatitis A. \"He got better and then got worse again,\" recalls Nigel Heaton, the consultant surgeon who performed Needs' operation. \"At that point he went to the top of the national priority list, so that if a liver became available anywhere in the UK, it would be offered to him.\" The average adult patient in Simon's position waits 36 hours for an organ to become available. \"We once went 10 days without one, for a patient who was listed as super-urgent,\" says Heaton. \"That patient died.\" </p> <p>The precariousness of Needs' position forced the centre to relax its requirements: as a patient in n-stage - critical and with a few days to live - the perfection of the tissue match was compromised by the need to keep him alive. Duty managers at the transplant centre are faced, on receipt of a case like Needs', with the certainty that within 24 hours they will be processing at least one death: either the patient's or a donor's. If the atmosphere at the centre is bland, it is deliberately so, contrived to protect staff from the psychological impact of auditing human organs. \"The staff in the duty office are admin people, with no clinical backgrounds,\" says Sutherland, a former nurse and midwife. \"This makes the whole thing completely objective. They key in the donor's details and it brings up matches with suitable recipients. There's no 'Oh, he's a nice bloke. Let's give it to him today.' To us it's an organ and you have to forget about the deceased behind it.\" </p> <p>At 4.30pm on Friday September 22 1995, Paul Porter was declared brain dead. The following morning, after a second brain-stem test, his death certificate was signed, and at 9am the hospital's transplant coordinator called the UK Transplant Centre with news that a liver had become available. Within minutes the centre's database, stored on four computers on the first floor, had identified a positive match with Needs. This is the hub of the operation, the traffic control centre through which organs are placed at a rate of 12 or so a week. With a minimum of fuss, a call was put in to Nigel Heaton at King's College hospital. </p> <p>When Heaton received the call, he assembled a team of two surgeons, a scrub nurse and a surgical assistant, and dispatched them to Heathrow. They had 20 hours to get to Aberdeen, harvest the organ and return to London. Heaton made the decision to charter a plane at a cost of \u00a35,000 (to have collected the liver by commercial airline would have cost \u00a3360; by car \u00a3200-\u00a3300.) The importance of using a company experienced in handling organs can be vital. \"If a liver is put in the aircraft's hold by someone who doesn't know what they are doing, it can be exposed to temperatures of minus 60 degrees,\" says Heaton. \"The liver freezes and that will kill the patient.\" </p> <p>Since then, transplant teams have been organised into regional zones, so that a liver in Aberdeen will be retrieved by a team from Edinburgh and passed on from there. In 1995, however, there were no such arrangements. \"We have flown hearts from here to Berlin in an executive jet,\" says Jetmund Engeset, the vascular transplant surgeon at Aberdeen. </p> <p>Only two categories of patient are forbidden to be donors: those who have died from HIV- or CJD-related illnesses. Once the organs have become available, priority is given to children on the waiting list, then to n-stage adult patients, and finally to those non-urgent patients nearest in age and tissue type to the donor. If the first-choice patient falls through, a call goes out offering the organ to every transplant centre in the country. The first to snap it up within 30 minutes gets the organ. </p> <p>\"The key thing is to allocate the organs equitably,\" says Sue Falvey, a duty office manager at the transplant centre. \"If there are no urgent patients registered, then the organ will get offered on a rotational basis. If Manchester, say, accepts a heart, then it [that hospital] would rotate to the bottom.\" </p> <p>By 8pm that Saturday night, Heaton's team had begun the operation to remove Porter's liver. His kidneys had also been allocated: one to a patient in north Staffordshire, the other to a six-year-old boy in Manchester. By 10pm, Heaton's crew were making their way back to the airport. They arrived back in London a little after midnight and the delicate transplant procedure got under way. \"People with acute liver failure often have swollen brains or their lungs aren't working properly,\" says Heaton. \"It's possible to die during the operation from severe lung failure.\" By Sunday morning, however, Simon Needs was successfully in possession of a new liver. A month later, weighing six stone less than when he was admitted, he awoke from his coma and was discharged. </p> <p>He is a broad-shouldered man, dedicated in the aftermath of his operation to squeezing as much from life as his shot-through stomach will allow. \"I went through a little bit of 'I've got someone else's liver' squeamishness,\" he says. \"A few people called me 'porky' because there was a lot of talk about transplanting pigs' livers at the time. But after that I adjusted quickly. It is no more artificial than the drugs they inject into you. I'm not up to 100% - I can't play contact sports - but I am sailing round the world at the end of the year.\" </p> <p>After recovering, Needs was encouraged to send an anonymous \"thank you\" letter to Paul's family. \"It can take recipients a year to write that letter,\" says Sue Johnstone, of Time, the organ donation charity operating from the ground floor of the centre. \"How do you find the words to say 'thank you' for your life? There is guilt as well. Some recipients think of it in terms of, 'Somebody had to die in order for me to live.' But that's not true. They would have died anyway.\" </p> <p>\"We have to maintain complete confidentiality,\" says Sue Sutherland, \"but we will say that the heart went to Essex, for example. If the two sides are desperate to have contact then they will. There are cases of families who have met up and feel that their loved ones have lived on in somebody else.\" </p> <p>\"I was so pleased to receive that letter,\" says Bernadette Porter. \"We've all felt a lot happier knowing that Paul has given someone a new lease of life. I don't know that I could have coped as well if this hadn't been the case. I've felt enormously curious about the recipient, but you don't want to frighten them by making them feel they have this emotional bond with some stranger who lost a child.\" </p> <p>When Simon Needs sails round the world, it will be on a yacht called The Gift of Life, with a 30-strong crew composed entirely of people who have benefited from transplant operations. \"I want to show the value of transplants,\" he says. \"People imagine that after a transplant you will only be around for another couple of years. I'm going to live until I'm 80.\" </p> <p>There are eight million registered organ donors in Britain - 12% of the population. It is the aim of both Needs and the centre to motivate the 40% of Britons who say they are in favour of donation but are too lethargic to register, by reminding them that one third of patients on the waiting list die. </p> <p>\"Only 2,500 transplants take place a year,\" says Sue Sutherland. \"We are at the small end of the business. But the impact a transplant has on a patient's life is profound.\" It is a fact, says Needs, that he his happy to go 30,000 miles round the world to illustrate. </p> <p>\"On bad days I still think what was the point of it all?\" says Bernadette Porter. \"But then I think of Paul, what a joy he was and how we loved having him all those years and, in the end, how he did so much good for so many people. It wasn't a waste, his life.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Simon Needs was on a sailing holiday in Southampton when a glance in the mirror informed him that his eyes had turned yellow. A property developer and man of sufficient heft to accommodate most of life's nasty surprises, he took some antibiotics and thought no more about it. That was on Friday. On Monday he was diagnosed with hepatitis A. On Tuesday he went into hepatic failure and was rushed to King's College hospital in London. By the end of the week, 41-year-old Needs was in a coma and his family had been summoned from Bedford to exchange final goodbyes. Over the next two days, Needs' life hung not on the skill of surgeons, but on the mobilisation of a small group of administrators on the outskirts of Bristol. The UK transplant centre is a two-storey building at the back of a business park. It takes several goes round the roundabout and a circuit of Sainsbury's car park to find it. \"I'm sure people read the sign and imagine we have freezers full of organs here,\" says Sue Sutherland, the centre's chief executive. Her 100-strong team coordinates every organ transplant in Britain, matching donors to patients. While accident and emergency wards scramble through the mire to save lives, the transplant centre executes its rescues in the atmosphere of a local reference library. Sutherland's team have a problem. Over the past 10 years, the number of organs available for transplant each year has fallen by roughly 1,000, and, though there is no evidence yet of a fall-off, there are fears that the Alder Hey scandal will deter potential donors. Hence the \u00a33m initiative launched yesterday by Alan Milburn, the health secretary, to double the number of people on the donation register. \"We want to reassure the public that there is a great difference between donating an organ for transplant and for postmortem,\" says Sutherland. Bernadette Porter can testify to that. On Saturday afternoon, while Simon Needs and his crew docked at Southampton, her 15-year-old son Paul was taking a walk 600 miles away, along a headland known as the Knab in Lerwick, Shetland. It is a beauty spot overlooking the North Sea, where Paul used to sledge in the winter and ramble in the summer. \"He was so fit and healthy, intelligent and beautiful,\" she says. \"He was really interested in science and thought it was awful that his dad and I didn't carry a donor card. He was quite determined to carry one himself.\" The grass was slippery that September day and, suddenly losing his footing, Paul fell 60 feet on to the rocks below. After a joint rescue operation by police, coastguards and the lifeboat service, he was taken to Lerwick's Gilbert Bain Hospital with serious head injuries, from where he was flown by air ambulance to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and put in intensive care. \"It took a week for him to die,\" says Porter. \"When the hospital asked if they could use his organs, I would have been horrified if Paul hadn't prepared me for it.\" The critical factor in all transplants is freshness: the shelf life of a kidney is 24 hours, a heart or lung six, a liver 18 to 20.

Peter, 10, clutches a copy of Seriously Cool Puffin Stories and reels off his favourites. When he mentions The Hundred Mile an Hour Dog, the banter with Grant, the manager at the children's home where Peter lives, revs up again. \"Yeah, that's like the dog round here, someone sees it in the rubbish and it speeds off: hundred mile an hour,\" says Grant, his hand shooting out in imitation. </p> <p>\"I like the one best with the Demon Headmaster,\" says Peter. </p> <p>\"I'm not that clever,\" he insists, \"but I do like reading: Harry Potter books, Roald Dahl and some others.\" </p> <p>Peter lives in a children's home in St Helen's, Merseyside, that is involved in a pilot scheme to encourage children in care to read. According to a report published this week, it has achieved astonishing results. Forty homes in five local authority pilot schemes have received packages of 50 brand new books from the Right to Read Project. The scheme is organised by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, the National Literacy Association and the Who Cares? Trust, which campaigns for the rights of children in care. With donations from leading children's publishers (of books that range from classics to mass-market favourites such as Star Wars and Sabrina), Right to Read has built up libraries, organised \"achievement days\" for young readers and a roadshow with popular children's authors. </p> <p>The scheme is already paying off as the report reveals that reading with a carer has actually improved the children's reading skills, cemented relationships with their carers and given the children a much-needed boost at school. </p> <p>At a home for girls just down the hill in St Helen's, Angela, aged 15, recently received the top mark for her English exam. \"I only had to talk for six minutes,\" she says proudly, \"but I could have talked for six hours.\" </p> <p>Her bedroom is crammed with books and reading is now among her favourite activities. \"It helps you develop a good imagination and a good imagination sets you free,\" she explains. Lorraine Edwards, the home's unit manager, says the change in Angela since she discovered the pleasure of reading is profound: \"When she first arrived two years ago, she didn't read at all. Since she's discovered the Star Wars books, she has sat her reading exam and she never would have had the confidence to do that before.\" </p> <p>Now Angela plans to become a nursery nurse and to pass her passion for books on to other children. </p> <p>The library of well-kept books in a corner of the living room at the home marks a radical change in attitude. \"The library means a lot,\" says Edwards, \"because it's not about reading just being to do with school - the girls are actually reading for fun.\" </p> <p>Many children who arrive at the home have never been read a bedtime story, visited a library or had a book of their own. Consequently, the educational achievements of children in care are dismal, with 70% of children leaving with no qualifications and only 4% gaining five or more GCSEs. The NLA's goal is for 99% of these children to leave school with adequate literacy for daily life. </p> <p>Edwards says that the home's annual book budget is usually just \u00a325, which buys a few reference books but leaves little for fiction. The greatest constraint is financial: a Right to Read questionnaire circulated to the pilot schemes found that the most frequently cited reason for not having books in a home was lack of funds. Charlie Griffiths, NLA director, says that books have been seen as a luxury instead of a necessity: \"One of the things we're saying in the report is that funding books has got to be ongoing. It's not enough to give a home 50 books and say, that's it. It's got to be down to the local authority to find the money to fund books.\" </p> <p>If the people in charge of drawing up budgets were to compare the book budgets for children in care with the amount spent on their own children, they might think differently, Griffiths observes. \"Reading a book together is a shared magical experience. And if you've got a caring adult giving you that time, that is something which makes a child feel valued. It's important for reading and for feeling confident and valued.\" </p> <p>All children's names have been changed. For information, email the Who Cares?

The battalion became one of the second world war's most feared Nazi death squads. Throughout the summer of 1941, it was involved in rounding up and murdering thousands of civilian men, women and children in Lithuania.</p> <p>In one of the battalion's operations in the town of Slutsk, over two days, around 1,000 Jews were dragged from factories and shops. They were shot and buried in mass graves.</p> <p>In another operation in Minsk's Jewish ghetto, one member of the battalion remembered Mr Gecas helping in an operation which saw Germans round up a column of Jews \"four abreast and more than 300 metres long\" in front of specially dug pits.

Five years later, he lost a \u00a3600,000 libel action against the company.

But the Crown Office, the Scottish prosecution service, decided there was not enough evidence to bring proceedings against Mr Gecas. There are similar stories across Britain: only one person - Anthony Sawoniuk - has been successfully prosecuted under the act.</p> <p>The US, and more recently Canada, where many other suspected war criminals fled, deal with these men under immigration law: the US has deported or denaturalised 116 suspected war criminals. The home secretary, Jack Straw, is considering whether similar procedures should be adopted in Britain.</p> <p>Mr Gecas claims he was merely fighting for his country, with the Germans against the Russians and then with allies against the Germans. \"I feel this country is ungrateful for the fighting I did,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Zuroff is unconvinced. \"It was opportunism not morality that made him switch sides,\" he said. \"He's an old man, so what? Let him stand trial. This is a brilliant opportunity to bring Gecas before justice. If he's telling the truth, and I'm wrong, what's he got to fear? Your British justice should not ignore this guy again.\"</p>",

The US, and more recently Canada, where many other suspected war criminals fled, deal with these men under immigration law: the US has deported or denaturalised 116 suspected war criminals. The home secretary, Jack Straw, is considering whether similar procedures should be adopted in Britain. Mr Gecas claims he was merely fighting for his country, with the Germans against the Russians and then with allies against the Germans. \"I feel this country is ungrateful for the fighting I did,\" he said. Mr Zuroff is unconvinced. \"It was opportunism not morality that made him switch sides,\" he said. \"He's an old man, so what? Let him stand trial. This is a brilliant opportunity to bring Gecas before justice. If he's telling the truth, and I'm wrong, what's he got to fear? Your British justice should not ignore this guy again.\"",

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch must wait until accountants have pored over the books at his News Corporation empire before he can realise his dream of a \u00a349bn merger with US satellite broadcaster DirecTV. Mr Murdoch told the Variety conference in New York that due diligence, or a very detailed examination of both companies' accounts, is delaying a deal that would create a global broadcasting group. The complicated deal involves Mr Murdoch's Sky Global Networks satellite TV companies merging into DirecTV's parent company Hughes Electronics, which is owned by US car group General Motors. \"Both sides are still right in due diligence. That's the situation at the moment. I think GM is happy with it and so is News Corp,\" said Mr Murdoch. The process will be complicated by the involvement of software giant Microsoft, which is investing \u00a33.5bn in the deal and must be included in the due diligence process. Rival media executives have praised the DirecTV merger, with Howard Stringer of Sony admitting he was \"envious\" of the deal. \"Just the ability to spin sports and other programming around the globe represents an extraordinary opportunity,\" said Mr Stringer. \"I've been envious of a lot of deals in the last few years. This would be one of them.\" Barry Diller, chief executive of USA Networks, said a fortified Sky Global Networks could represent a serious threat to the power of cable television in the US. If the deal is completed, Sky Global will be a satellite broadcaster with a major presence in the US, Asian, European and Latin American markets. \"I think it would be a transforming transaction,\" said Mr Diller.

He even presented a series on the station about lap dancers. Mr Desmond, who owns the Express, the Sunday Express and the Star, has announced he wants to sell off his paper-based pornograph interests. But the Fantasy Channel, the subscription-based service thought to account for most of his estimated \u00a3100m wealth, is not up for sale.",

      "bodyText": "The head of the Newspaper Industry's Code of Practice Committee has attacked new government proposals to curb journalists from share-tipping as \"completely unworkable\". Les Hinton, who is also the executive chairman of News International, has written a strongly-worded letter to the economic secretary to the Treasury, Melanie Johnson. The letter states: \"In any newspaper or magazine, a substantial number of people have an involvement in an article - not just the journalist who writes the article, but the commissioning editor, the City (or possibly political or home affairs) editor, the sub editor, on occasion the picture editor, a copy taker, a lawyer who may clear the article, the deputy editor and the editor.\" Mr Hinton argues that the new proposals do not make clear with whom the ultimate responsibility lies. \"If copy is changed after the journalist writes it - in a manner which brings it within the scope to the Order - is the originating journalist still responsible?\" the letter asks. Under new rules journalists will have to declare if they have any interest in any shares tipped or written about. The rules have been drafted in the wake of the scandal generated by the former City Slickers, Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell, who were sacked last year from the Mirror. The Mirror's editor, Piers Morgan, was found to have bought shares in computer manufacturer Viglen after the two journalists had tipped the shares in their City column. Other financial journalists are incensed by the plans, believing the rules to be cumbersome and unworkable. National newspaper groups put forward arguments to the Treasury that self-regulation was the best way to prevent insider dealing, market manipulation and other new financial crimes. The rules are part of the legislation that will enable the Financial Services Authority to begin its regulatory powers later this year.",

The admission came as the designer of the Tomb Raider series said it had racked up a nine-month loss of \u00a368m. The loss is blamed on an ill-advised internet investment and the writing off of a stockpile of unwanted games. Two years ago Eidos was soaring on the back of the success of Tomb Raider. But the appeal of its products has faded and the company is relying on the much-delayed PS2 console to kick-start its fortunes once again. \"While the company remains confident in the mid to long-term prospects of the entertainment software market, there continues to be a lack of visibility through to Christmas 2001,\" said Eidos chief executive Mike McGarvey. He said the company was \"cautious\" about the next 12 months. Sony is still experiencing delays in producing the PS2 box, and Microsoft's rival Xbox is up to a year away from arriving in Europe. Mr McGarvey said 2002 will be the real \"growth year\" for PS2 consoles, when Sony begins full production of its much-hyped product. \"While we are certainly very excited about the new platforms, I think we will be cautious into next year. \"We will remain wary until we see the consoles in the marketplace,\" he added. The Eidos turnover figures for the nine months to December last year underlined the cyclical nature of the games market, which is boosted every time a new console appears.

      "body": "<p> <strong>Joe Phillips</strong><br>Bingham, Notts<br></p> <p>\u0095 You report on the \"discrimination\" allegedly experienced by faith-based welfare organisations when seeking public funding. You could also usefully explore the discrimination widely practised by these organisations against other people. </p> <p>Some religious groups have been guilty of discriminating both against those seeking help or those they employ because they failed to lead a sufficiently \"Christian\" lifestyle. There is copious evidence of this in the report Christian Homophobia, published by the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement. Suspected co-habitees and adulterers have also been targeted. </p> <p>If more public money is to be made available to religious groups, it should be ring-fenced for the benefit of service users, rather than being used for proselytisation or for the promotion of a particular religion. Any organisation wanting public money should be willing to apply equal opportunities to its service provision and employment policy. </p> <p><strong>Terry Sanderson</strong><br>Council member, National Secular Society, London<br></p> <p> <strong> National concern</strong> </p> <p> The government's last minute concessions over patient representation in the health and social care bill go some way towards limiting the damage done by the abolition of community health councils (Malcolm Dean, February 21). Crucially, they begin to address concerns about the lack of both an integrated local watchdog and of independent advocacy. </p> <p>However, there is one glaring omission: a national body. The health and social care bill abolishes the Association of Community Health Councils (ACHCEW), a national patients' watchdog, without putting any other national structure in its place. This will mean that patients lack a single statutory body to represent them at a national level and that nation-wide information gathering, such as that which goes into our annual national \"Casualty Watch\" survey, simply cannot take place. It will also mean that patient representatives within the new system will be deprived of the training, information and legal advice that they now receive from ACHCEW. </p> <p>It is not enough to have more patient representatives within the system. We need to ensure that those representatives have access to training, support, information and a network of others in a similar position. We also need to ensure that they have a means of raising their concerns at a national level. Sometimes the problem doesn't rest with an individual trust or health authority but with the Department of Health itself. Maintaining a national patients' voice is the only way to make sure the right people get the message. </p> <p><strong>Donna Covey</strong><br>Director, Association of Community Health Councils of England and Wales<br></p> <p><strong> Staff of life</strong><br> </p> <p> I sympathise with ND Smith (Letters, February 14), whose mother-in-law in Leeds has to move because her nursing home is to close as it cannot afford the improvements required under the new legislation. </p> <p>Of course, physical standards are important, but the care offered in nursing homes is surely more so. It is little comfort to be in a single room if one is left alone, hungry, wet and thirsty. Staffing problems are well known. The shortage of nurses is acute and some moonlight in homes on their days off from the local hospital or work excessively long hours. In the home my mother was in, staff often had to \"cover\" for missing colleagues, and all the staff changed constantly. </p> <p>Much needs to be done in recruitment, training, management, conditions of service and support. Improvement in these areas would also be expensive and harder to achieve than putting in an extra lavatory. The other danger is that if physical standards are good, assumptions may be made about the quality of care - for example, by an inspector on a pre-arranged visit. </p> <p>A greatly strengthened inspection system, as is planned, is welcome, but my choice would have been to tackle staffing issues first. </p> <p>Some residents in the nursing homes are so frail they cannot ask for a drink or even pick up a cup; they are completely helpless and some are utterly alone in the world. All of them deserve better from us. </p> <p><strong>Sheila Millington</strong><br>Weybridge, Surrey<br></p> <p><strong> Breaking even</strong><br> </p> <p> If all the people who object to cigarette breaks hadn't complained in the first place, the smokers wouldn't have to leave their work to smoke (Smoking gun? February 14). So why don't they invite them back into the office and then they'd all be happy, wouldn't they? </p> <p><strong>Joyce Wiles</strong><br>Enfield, Middlesex<br></p> <p>Write to Guardian Society, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER; or fax 020-7713 4154 or email <a href=\"mailto:society@theguardian.com\">society@theguardian.com</a> Please supply your full address.

      "bodyText": "Joe Phillips Bingham, Notts \u0095 You report on the \"discrimination\" allegedly experienced by faith-based welfare organisations when seeking public funding. You could also usefully explore the discrimination widely practised by these organisations against other people. Some religious groups have been guilty of discriminating both against those seeking help or those they employ because they failed to lead a sufficiently \"Christian\" lifestyle. There is copious evidence of this in the report Christian Homophobia, published by the Lesbian and Gay Christian Movement. Suspected co-habitees and adulterers have also been targeted. If more public money is to be made available to religious groups, it should be ring-fenced for the benefit of service users, rather than being used for proselytisation or for the promotion of a particular religion. Any organisation wanting public money should be willing to apply equal opportunities to its service provision and employment policy. Terry Sanderson Council member, National Secular Society, London National concern The government's last minute concessions over patient representation in the health and social care bill go some way towards limiting the damage done by the abolition of community health councils (Malcolm Dean, February 21). Crucially, they begin to address concerns about the lack of both an integrated local watchdog and of independent advocacy. However, there is one glaring omission: a national body. The health and social care bill abolishes the Association of Community Health Councils (ACHCEW), a national patients' watchdog, without putting any other national structure in its place. This will mean that patients lack a single statutory body to represent them at a national level and that nation-wide information gathering, such as that which goes into our annual national \"Casualty Watch\" survey, simply cannot take place. It will also mean that patient representatives within the new system will be deprived of the training, information and legal advice that they now receive from ACHCEW. It is not enough to have more patient representatives within the system. We need to ensure that those representatives have access to training, support, information and a network of others in a similar position. We also need to ensure that they have a means of raising their concerns at a national level. Sometimes the problem doesn't rest with an individual trust or health authority but with the Department of Health itself. Maintaining a national patients' voice is the only way to make sure the right people get the message. Donna Covey Director, Association of Community Health Councils of England and Wales Staff of life I sympathise with ND Smith (Letters, February 14), whose mother-in-law in Leeds has to move because her nursing home is to close as it cannot afford the improvements required under the new legislation. Of course, physical standards are important, but the care offered in nursing homes is surely more so. It is little comfort to be in a single room if one is left alone, hungry, wet and thirsty. Staffing problems are well known. The shortage of nurses is acute and some moonlight in homes on their days off from the local hospital or work excessively long hours. In the home my mother was in, staff often had to \"cover\" for missing colleagues, and all the staff changed constantly. Much needs to be done in recruitment, training, management, conditions of service and support. Improvement in these areas would also be expensive and harder to achieve than putting in an extra lavatory. The other danger is that if physical standards are good, assumptions may be made about the quality of care - for example, by an inspector on a pre-arranged visit. A greatly strengthened inspection system, as is planned, is welcome, but my choice would have been to tackle staffing issues first. Some residents in the nursing homes are so frail they cannot ask for a drink or even pick up a cup; they are completely helpless and some are utterly alone in the world. All of them deserve better from us. Sheila Millington Weybridge, Surrey Breaking even If all the people who object to cigarette breaks hadn't complained in the first place, the smokers wouldn't have to leave their work to smoke (Smoking gun? February 14). So why don't they invite them back into the office and then they'd all be happy, wouldn't they?

This week's magazine, for example, devotes 20 pages to Celine Dion and her new miracle baby and seven pages to Leonardo di Caprio's fiance Gisele Bunchen and five pages to an ITV star from Heartbeat Tricia Penrose. Mr Hall has also hired Debbie Frank, Princess Diana's former astrologer, David Billington, the former Express art editor, and Clair Woodward, the former OK! deputy editor. Seven Days will launch on March 13 and be bound in the centre of Hello!",

      "bodyText": "Vizzavi, the multi-access portal owned jointly by Vivendi Universal and Vodafone, has confirmed it has hired WCRS to handle its European advertising business. The task, which involves building brand awareness quickly and encouraging customer acquisition, is worth up to \u00a3100m. Vizzavi's consumer campaign will run across five territories: UK, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. It will be led by WCRS London with support from agencies in its European network. WCRS scooped the account from Vizzavi's incumbent agency Publicis, while other agencies shortlisted were BMP DDB, Bates UK and D'Arcy. The news is a welcome boost to WCRS, which was ditched by long-term client Orange last year. \"While WCRS's knowledge of the mobile arena was advantageous, its strategic thinking and brand positioning work won it the account,\" said Guy Laurence, Vizzavi's chief marketing officer. At the beginning of this month, Vodafone appointed WCRS to its \u00a348m UK advertising account. The agency is also pitching for Vodafone's wider global business. Vizzavi was unveiled in the UK last summer with a press and poster advertising blitz but it has since maintained a low profile. The service is available online and via Wap devices but the company wants to roll it out to other platforms, including digital television. The branded multi-access portal will compete with the US giants AOL Time Warner and Yahoo! Optimedia and CIA Medianetwork are understood to be fighting for Vizzavi's media buying account. The company said it would announce the winner of this pitch shortly.",

      "bodyText": "The BBC's public consultation on its proposed digital services has been rubbished for being \"not representative of the public in any meaningful sense\" by leading polling organisation Mori. The Mori analysis of the BBC consultation process was commissioned by a group of the corporation's commercial broadcasting rivals. It concluded: \"The respondents as a group are insufficiently representative of the general public to 'demonstrate conclusively' anything about the opinions of licence payers in general\". As a result, the consultation was \"clearly not representative of the public in any meaningful sense and cannot be considered a reliable measurement of public opinion\", according to Mori. \"We see little evidence the BBC's consultation exercise is adequate to support the conclusions drawn from it and submitted to the Department of Culture, Media and Sport in its application for approval of new public services,\" the survey concluded. But a BBC spokesman dismissed the Mori analysis. \"This is a pretty desperate attempt to undermine plans for the future of public service broadcasting in this country and expand the free-to-air choice in the digital future,\" he said. Mori's study concluded the BBC consultation was based on a \"self-selecting group\" responding either to broadcast trails on corporation services or via the BBC website. The polling body also noted the final sample of 6,768 people was \"considerably skewed with, for example, 72% of respondents being male, compared with 48% of the UK adult population\". Mori's survey of the BBC consultation questionnaire found some individual questions to be \"meaningless\" and \"badly designed\", with the overall document reckoned to be of \"limited worth\". The BBC spokesman defended the consultation, saying it had been the \"biggest ever\" undertaken by the corporation. He added the TV and radio trails alone would have reached 85% of the UK population. The BBC also promoted the consultation with press advertising, a press conference, public events and through its website. The spokesman said the BBC had also used South Bank Consultants to do an independent assessment of the validity of the consultation exercise. In addition, a parallel survey had been commissioned from BMRB, using a representative sample. \"The responses that came back from BMRB were even more positive than the so-called self-selecting results,\" he claimed. The Mori analysis was commissioned by BSkyB, Artsworld, Fox Kids, Nickelodeon UK, MTV Networks Europe and the Commercial Radio Companies Association. Today is the deadline for submissions to the DCMS on the BBC's digital service proposals.",

Many children do not know how food is grown or how animals are reared \u0095 Between 1978 and 1998, the distance food was transported increased by 50% \u0095 Transporting animals long distances to slaughter has made it almost impossible to contain outbreaks of serious diseases such as foot and mouth \u0095 Journeys of 200-400 miles to slaughter are not unusual for animals today \u0095 The average journey to abattoir has been estimated at 100 miles \u0095 In 1996, Britain imported 233,000 tonnes of beef - 80,000 tonnes of which were from outside the EU. The beef came from as far away as Namibia (9,500km) and Australia (21,000km) \u0095 In order to be transported long distances food must be heavily processed, packaged, or chemically preserved \u0095 25m tonnes of waste was produced in Britain in 1997 and one-third of that was packaging \u0095 Britain's food market is dominated by five big supermarekt groups: Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Safeway and Somerfield \u0095 The big five between them account for more than 80 % of all grocery sales \u0095 The combined profits of the top four supermarkets was \u00a32.1bn in 2000 \u0095 An inquiry by the competition commission looked into whether cheaper farm prices were passed on to the consumer. It found that the fall in prices which has hit farmers was passed on to the consumer - or that where it was not, this was because there were other increases elsewhere in the supply chain \u0095 The inquiry also found that the real price of food had fallen by more than 9% between 1989 and 1998 \u0095 Supermarket profits are much greater than the combined income of all UK small farmers \u0095 Each new major supermarket in a city has been found to cause up to 200 job losses \u0095 The food we eat is increasingly processed \u0095 Sales of chilled ready meals grew by 12% in 1999, while fresh fruit consumption fell by 3%, although sales of fresh fruit and vegetables had been increasing \u0095 The major growth area in 1999 was in processed meats and meat products. Frozen convenience meat products have grown by 127% since 1978 \u0095 Milk Farmers get an average of 17p a litre for milk, though it costs them an average of 22p a litre to produce. A typical supermarket price is 35p a litre \u0095 Beef It is almost impossible for a farmer to make a living producing beef in this country. Compensation for BSE cost \u00a3607m \u0095 Fruit We now import four out of every five pears we eat. 65% of apple orchards have been lost. We imported 434,000 tonnes of apples in 1996. Cox's receive an average of 16 pesticide sprays \u0095 Salad Lettuces can come from Spain, Turkey, Zimbabwe and Mexico. A typical crop will be sprayed 11.7 times",

The president said the prime minister promised: \"Nato is going to be the primary way to keep the peace in Europe\". But how to square assurances to the Americans that European defence moves will not undermine Nato with French insistence that the European Union must have its own \"autonomous\" defence planning structure?</p> <p>The Nice Treaty, signed by EU ministers on Monday, says that common foreign and security policy shall include \"all questions relating to the security of the union\". A long annex to the conclusions of the Nice summit last December, to which the treaty does not refer, said the aim was to give the EU \"an autonomous capacity to take decisions and action in the security and defence field\". But UK ministers quickly point to a succeeding passage in the annex which affirmed this \"does not involve the establishment of a European army. The commitment of national resources by member states to such operations will be based on their sovereign decisions. Nato remains the basis of the collective defence of its members and will continue to play an important role in crisis management. The development of European security and defence policy will contribute to the vitality of a renewed transatlantic link\".</p> <p>So far so unclear. Debate about European security has been poverty-stricken, a confection of past cliches. Carefully-worded EU texts have sought to disguise tensions. Yet they are unable to hide the shifting of the tectonic plates beneath the Atlantic, symbolised above all by American plans for missile defence.

      "bodyText": "The official line after last week's Camp David meeting between George Bush and Tony Blair was that the \"special relationship\" remains in place and intact. And Nato. The president said the prime minister promised: \"Nato is going to be the primary way to keep the peace in Europe\". But how to square assurances to the Americans that European defence moves will not undermine Nato with French insistence that the European Union must have its own \"autonomous\" defence planning structure? The Nice Treaty, signed by EU ministers on Monday, says that common foreign and security policy shall include \"all questions relating to the security of the union\". A long annex to the conclusions of the Nice summit last December, to which the treaty does not refer, said the aim was to give the EU \"an autonomous capacity to take decisions and action in the security and defence field\". But UK ministers quickly point to a succeeding passage in the annex which affirmed this \"does not involve the establishment of a European army. The commitment of national resources by member states to such operations will be based on their sovereign decisions. Nato remains the basis of the collective defence of its members and will continue to play an important role in crisis management. The development of European security and defence policy will contribute to the vitality of a renewed transatlantic link\". So far so unclear. Debate about European security has been poverty-stricken, a confection of past cliches. Carefully-worded EU texts have sought to disguise tensions. Yet they are unable to hide the shifting of the tectonic plates beneath the Atlantic, symbolised above all by American plans for missile defence. A seismograph is applied in a pamphlet out tomorrow from the Centre for European Reform*. It offers a calm and sober analysis of points which few people in this country have been prepared to face up to. It is all too easily assumed, the authors warn, that once the EU equips itself with credible means for military action, it will move into line with American views and strategies. \"In fact the opposite may well be true\". The Kosovo conflict was humiliating, dominated by American forces and technology: it served as a catalyst for more European defence co operation.

And there were calls from consumer groups for a radical rethink of our policy on food and farming.</p> <p>Mr Cleave, with his big business complex of farms, livestock transporting, dealing and exporting was beginning to look more like a symbol of everything that disturbs people about today's agriculture. The deadly virus might have blown in on a breeze, but this was British farming policy reaping the whirlwind - and consumers were saying enough is enough.</p> <p>\"Ordinary people can see the enormity of this. There is a powerful and growing sense that things cannot go on like this,\" said Tim Lang, professor of food policy at Thames Valley University. \"Why does British farming keep churning up crises like these?

Farmers' markets, where producers sell direct to the public have proved enormously popular.</p> <p>Whenever there is a food crisis, independent specialist retailers see a surge in interest. Roger Kelsey, a butcher in Shenfield, Essex, a few miles from the Cheale abattoir where the outbreak of foot and mouth disease was first confirmed, says customers are showing more and more interest in what they buy and where it comes from.</p> <p>\"I know all about where my meat was reared, how it lived, and where it was slaughtered. You can't get that in the supermarkets.\"</p> <p>Mr Kelsey uses a small abattoir near Chelmsford, even though Cheale's is just down the road, because it is a small operation with craft skills and it is closer to the farms where he gets his supplies. That means the animals do not have to travel so far, which is better for them but also because it minimises the stress, and means that the quality of the meat is better.</p> <p>Sales of organic foods have grown faster than anyone could have anticipated and are up 40% year on year.</p> <p>Mike Collins, of the Soil Association, said: \"When you are dealing with organic food that hasn't been imported, the emphasis is very much on keeping it local, where the supply chain is at its most simple and people can have real confidence in what they are eating.\"</p> <p>But a movement back to buying locally from specialists - often a pleasurable foraging activity for those with money to spare rather than shopping for essentials - will not on its own bring signficant change. Organic food still accounts for only 1% of the total UK food market, and much of it has to be imported.</p> <p>Sustain, the alliance for better farming and food, says the radical redirection consumers want can be brought about by switching the huge subsidies we pay through government and the EU to help those who farm in a different way.</p> <p>Policy director Vicki Herd says subsidies could be earned by those who, instead of supporting mass production, agree to farm in a way that protects the environment, provides healthy food and work locally.</p> <p>Mr Lang has a longer shopping list to bring about real change. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, has asked experts about a radical review. At national level Mr Lang thinks that means redefining the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Maff) so that healthy food becomes its core role, and instead of promoting agriculture its focus shifts to rural affairs. That requires joined-up thinking on transport and town planning, so that people can walk comfortably to local shops and so that the poor are not excluded.</p> <p>At a local level, the regional development agencies could help to rebuild a local supply and local consumption chain by marketing British produce to Britain instead of just abroad.</p> <p>But people also need to think about how much they pay for their food. \"You can't have cheap beans in a supermarket shed on the ring road and a vibrant, diverse local market,\" he says.</p> <p>Professor Richard Lacey, of Leeds University, similarly has no time for Maff's cautious inquiries into possible links between the intensification of farming and the spate of food crises. (He was the eminent microbiologist who as far back as 1988 suggested that humans could catch CJD from eating meat carrying BSE. He was pilloried for his pains.)</p> <p>\"We can attribute foot and mouth directly to our industrialised agriculture and food system,\" he said. The immediate key to it in his mind is the centralised production. \"If you have local food and local shops, things may go wrong but they don't spread like this.\" But for things to get better, we are going to have to change our attitude to food.</p> <p>The whole post-war philosophy for farming has been \"a preoccupation with an abundance of cheap food, and particularly cheap meat, and government has put in the mechanisms in the form of subsidies and regulation to produce it.\" If people want safer, nutritionally better, ethically better food, they will have to pay more. \"If people ate less, but more expensive meat and replaced some of it with more cereals, rice, fruit and vegetables, overall the cost to them would probably remain about the same,\" he argues.</p> <p>At a European level, the thorniest obstacle to change is reform of the common agriculture policy. But even here there seems to be a new mood, with the Germans and French, like us, forced into soul-searching by the recent farming crises.</p> <p>Tim Lang is optimistic. \"This is a historic moment.

The tests used are not the most sensitive and may well underestimate the scale of the problem.

A circular claims that donations of \u00a310,000 to the Tory party will give donors access to small and exclusive dinners, some attended by the US and Italian ambassadors. It is understood the US embassy will be sending a letter of clarification to the Conservative party. The Tory fundraising circular, recently sent out by the Conservative treasurer, Lord Ashcroft, claims anyone who gives more than \u00a310,000 to the party will be made a member of the Renaissance Forum, from which it will be possible to make \"your personal contribution at the highest level\". The circular claims that by joining the Renaissance Forum, \"you will be directly supporting the Conservative party\".

It also claims that a recent event saw Michael Portillo, Sir Clive Thompson and the Italian ambassador discussing the single currency. A spokesman for the US embassy said last night: \"It is totally wrong to suggest that the US ambassador would support partisan political events. He would not attend a fundraising event, nor would he like it to be portrayed that he has attended one.\" The ambassador's office suggested that in February last year he had been asked to attend an event described to him as Lord Feldman's Conservative Forum. He had not been aware that it was connected with Conservative fundraising or that he was being cited as an example of the benefits of joining the forum. Mr Lader, a Democrat, retires from his post today, when he will return to the US. The Conservative literature claims \"the forum is the most prestigious of our donor clubs\". It adds: \"Your membership will reserve your place at a series of private political lunches, dinners, receptions and social gatherings throughout the year\". The brochure has been sent out by the treasurer's department in a bid to raise as much as \u00a315m ahead of the general election. The letter claims the Labour party will be fighting the campaign with as much as \u00a340m.

      "byline": "Rich Johnston",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>What you are reading is a dead story. Hundreds of thousands of designer hours went into it, gigabytes of computer memory and bandwidth were taken over transmitting it and for two weekends, the phrase \"All your base are belong to us\" became one of the most requested on internet search engines across the world. Now, even this article mentioning it is passe. </p> <p>More than two weeks ago, I received an amusing email. And then received it again, 17 times. Every message board I went to, every forum I visited, has a discussion thread named after it. Remarkably, it didn't involve sexual thrills, jokes about pets or scenes of gratuitous violence. It was the introduction to a 10-year-old computer game called Zero Wing for the Sega Genesis console. This consisted of a series of Japanese cartoon-style stills telling a story. The dialogue below the images had been very badly translated from the original Japanese. Accompanying scenes of a battle in outer space, they read: </p> <p>In A.D. 2101 </p> <p>War was beginning. </p> <p>Captain: What happen? </p> <p>Operator: Somebody set up us the bomb. </p> <p>Operator: We get signal. </p> <p>Captain: What! </p> <p>Operator: Main screen turn on. </p> <p>Captain: It's you!! </p> <p>Cats: How are you gentlemen!! </p> <p>Cats: All your base are belong to us. </p> <p>Cats: You are on the way to destruction. </p> <p>Captain: What you say!! </p> <p>Cats: You have no chance to survive make your time. </p> <p>Cats: Ha ha ha ha ha! </p> <p>Cats: Take off every \"zig\". </p> <p>Captain: You know what you doing. </p> <p>Captain: Move \"zig\". </p> <p>Captain: For great justice. </p> <p>A day or so later, the pictures began to follow. These were photographs taken and altered by computer designers, with the most popular phrase - \"All your base are belong to us\" - inserted where appropriate. Street signs, restaurant awnings, cinema fronts, advertising, cartoons, T-shirts, tattoos, golf balls inserted into turtles, all bearing this new phrase. What was remarkable was the time and effort that must have been spent on making the words fit perfectly into the background, finding the right font, matching perspective and accounting for folds in the material that the message appeared on. </p> <p>This craze started around the middle of last year, sent around by a close group of technical experts. An in-joke to greet friends at the bar, an email signature, a punchline to a shared gag. And then it jumped, from speech and text to something visual. </p> <p>An early example is a photo of the alien puppet Alf from the US sitcom of the same name, speaking on the phone with a speech bubble containing the phrase. The Somethingawful.com forum picked this up and ran with it, continuing the pattern of placing the speech bubble on to existing photos. From December through to January, the phrase infected other message boards, with Tribalwar.com taking the strain.

      "bodyText": "What you are reading is a dead story. Hundreds of thousands of designer hours went into it, gigabytes of computer memory and bandwidth were taken over transmitting it and for two weekends, the phrase \"All your base are belong to us\" became one of the most requested on internet search engines across the world. Now, even this article mentioning it is passe. More than two weeks ago, I received an amusing email. And then received it again, 17 times. Every message board I went to, every forum I visited, has a discussion thread named after it. Remarkably, it didn't involve sexual thrills, jokes about pets or scenes of gratuitous violence. It was the introduction to a 10-year-old computer game called Zero Wing for the Sega Genesis console. This consisted of a series of Japanese cartoon-style stills telling a story. The dialogue below the images had been very badly translated from the original Japanese. Accompanying scenes of a battle in outer space, they read: In A.D. 2101 War was beginning. Captain: What happen? Operator: Somebody set up us the bomb. Operator: We get signal. Captain: What! Operator: Main screen turn on. Captain: It's you!! Cats: How are you gentlemen!! Cats: All your base are belong to us. Cats: You are on the way to destruction. Captain: What you say!! Cats: You have no chance to survive make your time. Cats: Ha ha ha ha ha! Cats: Take off every \"zig\". Captain: You know what you doing. Captain: Move \"zig\". Captain: For great justice. A day or so later, the pictures began to follow. These were photographs taken and altered by computer designers, with the most popular phrase - \"All your base are belong to us\" - inserted where appropriate. Street signs, restaurant awnings, cinema fronts, advertising, cartoons, T-shirts, tattoos, golf balls inserted into turtles, all bearing this new phrase. What was remarkable was the time and effort that must have been spent on making the words fit perfectly into the background, finding the right font, matching perspective and accounting for folds in the material that the message appeared on. This craze started around the middle of last year, sent around by a close group of technical experts. An in-joke to greet friends at the bar, an email signature, a punchline to a shared gag. And then it jumped, from speech and text to something visual. An early example is a photo of the alien puppet Alf from the US sitcom of the same name, speaking on the phone with a speech bubble containing the phrase. The Somethingawful.com forum picked this up and ran with it, continuing the pattern of placing the speech bubble on to existing photos. From December through to January, the phrase infected other message boards, with Tribalwar.com taking the strain. It was still mostly a techie/gamers-only craze, and new executions were more likely to have the phrase embedded in the photo rather than just pasted on in a speech bubble. Often a labour-intensive job, this was a chance to show off, to be part of the gang, and probably lost each individual's employer hours of gainful employ.

She then marched off in the opposite direction before lurching back to her stand. But this story has a happy ending.

One of the investment bank's suppliers (who can't be named for fear of retribution) asked if it could use Goldman's name in some minor publicity. No, came the reply from the retiring bankers, and you can't even make an unnamed reference to us as the City's leading investment bank.

      "body": "<p>Despite their tough image, the financial markets are suckers for a good story. The story they have enjoyed most in recent years is the one told by uncle Alan Greenspan about the perfect Goldilocks situation in the US - not too hot and not too cold. So you can rest assured that the dealers on Wall Street will be sitting comfortably when Al starts his latest tale before Congress later today. </p> <p>What they want to hear from the Federal Reserve chairman is that the story of the US economy has a happy ending coming soon. At the moment the fairy tale of how the American economy could go on growing and growing as if by magic has turned dark and gloomy: not enough about Goldilocks, too much about the bears. </p> <p>Like children gathered round the teacher, the markets have total faith in Mr Greenspan. Forget the fact that the titans of American business have been delivering profits warnings by the score. Forget the fact that the air is thick with dot.coms going to the wall. Forget the fact that the outlook for the global economy has darkened since Mr G gave the first half of his biannual testimony on monetary policy just weeks ago. None of this matters, because even if there are problems the Fed will ensure they are short-lived. </p> <p>Despite figures out last week showing an unwelcome surge in inflation, the markets are expecting Mr Greenspan to signal nothing less than another half-point cut in interest rates when the US Federal Reserve stages its next meeting on March 20, taking the cumulative easing of monetary policy since since the beginning of January to an aggressive 1.5 percentage points. </p> <p>So gloomy have the markets become that some analysts are anticipating a surprise, interim move. \"The Fed chairman might well see a need to act immediately if equities markets continue to struggle in the weeks ahead,\" said Marc Wanshel of JP Morgan in New York. </p> <p>This may be one of those times when markets would do well to remember DH Lawrence's dictum, however - never trust the artist, trust the tale. </p> <p>Officially, policymakers continue to express \"cautious optimism\" about the outlook for global growth. When finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven industrialised countries - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - got together 10 days ago for their first summit of the year in Palermo, Sicily, there was a lengthy debate about the shape of the US recovery. Would it be V, U, L or W-shaped? The G7 settled for the most optimistic scenario, predicting that it would be a V-shaped recovery. In other words, after a sharp slowdown in growth in the first half of the year, US growth would rebound smartly in the second. </p> <p>But the failure of Wall Street to respond to the full percentage point off rates announced by the Fed in January, coupled with the torpor of Japan's Nikkei Dow, could be rather more meaningful than the attempts by politicians and central bankers to sound notes of cosy reassurance. Analysts in New York may be trying to convince investors that America is simply experiencing a short V-shaped recession, but the main stock market indices hardly suggest an imminent recovery. Indeed, the 18% drop in the Nasdaq since the end of January, the 9% fall in the Wiltshire 5000 over the same period and a 4.3% drop in the value of the Nikkei point to an entirely different conclusion. </p> <p><strong> Cruising level</strong><br> </p> <p>Quite simply, the markets were wrong a year ago to assume that America had rewritten the laws of economics and could grow at 5% indefinitely, they were wrong six months ago to assume that the economy would descend to cruising level before taking off again, they were wrong three months ago to assume that the economy would have a soft landing and they are wrong now to assume that the recession nobody forecast 12 months ago will be short and sweet. </p> <p>Why could that be? The simple answer is that the American economy is at the end of a classic business cycle in which the length of the boom produced such heady optimism that businesses over-invested and over-expanded, building up productive capacity that would have struggled to be profitable even when the economy was growing by 5% a year. Now it is clear that over-optimistic forecasts for profits and earnings are not going to be met, firms are scrapping plant, scaling back investment and laying off staff to try to repair their balance sheets. </p> <p>Some analysts, such as Charles Dumas at Lombard Street Research, believe that interest rate cuts may delay the adjustment but that ultimately there has to be a day of reckoning. They believe that cutting interest rates is the equivalent of giving a junkie a fix. Having initially responded enthusiastically to rate cuts in January, the markets are now crying out for another shot of Dr Greenspan's medicine. Painful though it will be, a period of cold turkey for the US is unavoidable. </p> <p>Other analysts believe that rate cuts could do the trick, however - provided they are made quickly enough. </p> <p>Graham Turner of GFC Economics said: \"Mr Greenspan showed in 1991 that he is prepared to cut real [inflation adjusted] interest rates toward zero if the conditions merit such a move. The current backdrop suggests real rates may have to fall to similar levels. </p> <p>\"Unless the Fed Funds rate is lowered to around 3% by the summer, the downturn in the economy could prove to be more protracted than is necessary.\" </p> <p>On top of declining corporate earnings and the sharp fall in consumer confidence announced yesterday, dealers are also now fretting about the possibility of another emerging-markets crisis triggered by events in Turkey, and by the continued failure of the world's second-biggest economy, Japan, to emerge from its 10-year-period of slow growth. </p> <p>What the global economy needs to avoid is a repeat of the financial crises of three years ago. Julian Jessop, economist at Standard Chartered, says: \"Contagion is the fear in emerging markets, ever since the crises of 1997 and 1998. With events then still fresh in the memory, the floating of the Turkish lira has added to existing worries around the globe.\" </p> <p>Mr Jessop says many countries share the same problems as Turkey. The Czech Republic, Poland, Argentina and Brazil, for example, all have high levels of short-term debt. Argentina also has a similar currency regime, about which the markets have long had doubts. A speculative attack on any of these countries cannot be ruled out. </p> <p>In late 1998, Mr Greenspan was ahead of the game. </p> <p>He ensured that the story did not turn into Nightmare on Wall Street. This time he is behind the game, struggling to catch up. Even the master storyteller has no idea what is on the last page of the book this time.</p>",

So gloomy have the markets become that some analysts are anticipating a surprise, interim move. \"The Fed chairman might well see a need to act immediately if equities markets continue to struggle in the weeks ahead,\" said Marc Wanshel of JP Morgan in New York. This may be one of those times when markets would do well to remember DH Lawrence's dictum, however - never trust the artist, trust the tale. Officially, policymakers continue to express \"cautious optimism\" about the outlook for global growth. When finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven industrialised countries - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - got together 10 days ago for their first summit of the year in Palermo, Sicily, there was a lengthy debate about the shape of the US recovery. Would it be V, U, L or W-shaped? The G7 settled for the most optimistic scenario, predicting that it would be a V-shaped recovery. In other words, after a sharp slowdown in growth in the first half of the year, US growth would rebound smartly in the second. But the failure of Wall Street to respond to the full percentage point off rates announced by the Fed in January, coupled with the torpor of Japan's Nikkei Dow, could be rather more meaningful than the attempts by politicians and central bankers to sound notes of cosy reassurance. Analysts in New York may be trying to convince investors that America is simply experiencing a short V-shaped recession, but the main stock market indices hardly suggest an imminent recovery. Indeed, the 18% drop in the Nasdaq since the end of January, the 9% fall in the Wiltshire 5000 over the same period and a 4.3% drop in the value of the Nikkei point to an entirely different conclusion. Cruising level Quite simply, the markets were wrong a year ago to assume that America had rewritten the laws of economics and could grow at 5% indefinitely, they were wrong six months ago to assume that the economy would descend to cruising level before taking off again, they were wrong three months ago to assume that the economy would have a soft landing and they are wrong now to assume that the recession nobody forecast 12 months ago will be short and sweet. Why could that be? The simple answer is that the American economy is at the end of a classic business cycle in which the length of the boom produced such heady optimism that businesses over-invested and over-expanded, building up productive capacity that would have struggled to be profitable even when the economy was growing by 5% a year. Now it is clear that over-optimistic forecasts for profits and earnings are not going to be met, firms are scrapping plant, scaling back investment and laying off staff to try to repair their balance sheets. Some analysts, such as Charles Dumas at Lombard Street Research, believe that interest rate cuts may delay the adjustment but that ultimately there has to be a day of reckoning. They believe that cutting interest rates is the equivalent of giving a junkie a fix. Having initially responded enthusiastically to rate cuts in January, the markets are now crying out for another shot of Dr Greenspan's medicine. Painful though it will be, a period of cold turkey for the US is unavoidable. Other analysts believe that rate cuts could do the trick, however - provided they are made quickly enough. Graham Turner of GFC Economics said: \"Mr Greenspan showed in 1991 that he is prepared to cut real [inflation adjusted] interest rates toward zero if the conditions merit such a move. The current backdrop suggests real rates may have to fall to similar levels. \"Unless the Fed Funds rate is lowered to around 3% by the summer, the downturn in the economy could prove to be more protracted than is necessary.\" On top of declining corporate earnings and the sharp fall in consumer confidence announced yesterday, dealers are also now fretting about the possibility of another emerging-markets crisis triggered by events in Turkey, and by the continued failure of the world's second-biggest economy, Japan, to emerge from its 10-year-period of slow growth. What the global economy needs to avoid is a repeat of the financial crises of three years ago. Julian Jessop, economist at Standard Chartered, says: \"Contagion is the fear in emerging markets, ever since the crises of 1997 and 1998. With events then still fresh in the memory, the floating of the Turkish lira has added to existing worries around the globe.\" Mr Jessop says many countries share the same problems as Turkey. The Czech Republic, Poland, Argentina and Brazil, for example, all have high levels of short-term debt. Argentina also has a similar currency regime, about which the markets have long had doubts. A speculative attack on any of these countries cannot be ruled out. In late 1998, Mr Greenspan was ahead of the game. He ensured that the story did not turn into Nightmare on Wall Street. This time he is behind the game, struggling to catch up. Even the master storyteller has no idea what is on the last page of the book this time.",

      "body": "<p>A test firing from a Russian nuclear submarine in April could mark the start of the ultimate space adventure - a space clipper, sailing in the wind from the sun. </p> <p>The Planetary Society, a powerful US pressure group, announced yesterday it was preparing a 30-minute flight launched from a converted intercontinental ballistic missile launcher aboard a submarine in the Barents sea in April. If the launch is successful, a unique, privately funded Russian-American adventure will begin in the autumn. </p> <p>The same system will launch a tiny 40kg vehicle called Cosmos 1 more than 850km into space. Once in high orbit, Cosmos 1 will inflate a series of tubes which will flower into eight ultra-thin, triangular reflecting petals, which will form a sail 30 metres across. Light in a vacuum exerts a tiny pressure, and with no air resistance, this \"solar wind\" pressure would be enough to get a spaceclipper slowly accelerating, eventually to colossal speeds. </p> <p>The launch of Cosmos 1 will be the end of a dream first proposed in 1924, and then pressed by the late Carl Sagan, an astronomer, and Louis Friedman, director of the Planetary Society founded by Sagan. The commercial sponsors of Cosmos 1 will be Cosmos studios, headed by Sagan's widow, Ann Druyan. </p> <p>The April prototype will deploy only two blades, inflate a re-entry shield, take a few photographs of itself and then fall back to Earth in the Kamchatka region of Siberia. </p> <p>The autumn launch will unfurl 600 square metres of sails, which can be pitched like helicopter blades to control the ship's attitude and enable her to tack against the solar wind. </p> <p>Space sailing offers the dream of journeys without fuel. Launch costs are huge - $10,000 (about \u00a37,000) to put 1lb into orbit. And there are limits to the amount of fuel a spacecraft heading for Mars or Jupiter could carry. </p> <p>Although a spaceclipper would start slowly, theorists reckon one could get to speeds of 1km a second in eight days.

      "bodyText": "A test firing from a Russian nuclear submarine in April could mark the start of the ultimate space adventure - a space clipper, sailing in the wind from the sun. The Planetary Society, a powerful US pressure group, announced yesterday it was preparing a 30-minute flight launched from a converted intercontinental ballistic missile launcher aboard a submarine in the Barents sea in April. If the launch is successful, a unique, privately funded Russian-American adventure will begin in the autumn. The same system will launch a tiny 40kg vehicle called Cosmos 1 more than 850km into space. Once in high orbit, Cosmos 1 will inflate a series of tubes which will flower into eight ultra-thin, triangular reflecting petals, which will form a sail 30 metres across. Light in a vacuum exerts a tiny pressure, and with no air resistance, this \"solar wind\" pressure would be enough to get a spaceclipper slowly accelerating, eventually to colossal speeds. The launch of Cosmos 1 will be the end of a dream first proposed in 1924, and then pressed by the late Carl Sagan, an astronomer, and Louis Friedman, director of the Planetary Society founded by Sagan. The commercial sponsors of Cosmos 1 will be Cosmos studios, headed by Sagan's widow, Ann Druyan. The April prototype will deploy only two blades, inflate a re-entry shield, take a few photographs of itself and then fall back to Earth in the Kamchatka region of Siberia. The autumn launch will unfurl 600 square metres of sails, which can be pitched like helicopter blades to control the ship's attitude and enable her to tack against the solar wind. Space sailing offers the dream of journeys without fuel. Launch costs are huge - $10,000 (about \u00a37,000) to put 1lb into orbit. And there are limits to the amount of fuel a spacecraft heading for Mars or Jupiter could carry. Although a spaceclipper would start slowly, theorists reckon one could get to speeds of 1km a second in eight days. The bigger and lighter the sail, and the smaller the cargo, the faster it would accelerate. A sail six miles across could carry six tons of cargo to Pluto - at the edge of the solar system - in 18 months. The fuel-driven Cassini spacecraft now on her way to Saturn will have spent seven years on the journey. Dr Friedman says the experiment will fulfill several dreams - of Russians and Americans working together, of weapons turned to a peaceful adventure, and of privately funded space experiments. Cosmos 1 could fly for months while scientists test the technology and measure the acceleration. Experts may even try an extra \"puff\" of light-wind from a laser on Earth. Sunlight pressure would be enough to push it around the inner solar system. Beyond Jupiter, powerful focused lasers could drive it even further and faster.",

And he's got a lot more money than us, our dapper MP.\" The Rutland Times's Brian Martin tells us: \"Mr Duncan ... has quite often said he will take us to court, so we can't afford to print those things,\" while the Leicester Mercury editor Nick Carter went off the record to say much the same. As for Tim Robinson of the Stamford and Rutland Mercury, he seemed confused, first claiming he missed the story in August, and then insisting his news editor couldn't stand it up.</p> <p>Meanwhile, last week's Melton Times ran a photo of Little Alan posing with a packet of Fortnum's teabags (an imbecilic stunt; don't ask), and smiling broadly, tickled perhaps by the thought of our grotesque libel laws and how they make such a joke of freedom of speech. <br><br>\u0095 I am delighted to announce the new Book of the Month for March. It is To Dream A Dream (Blake Publishing), Piers Morgan's no-holds-barred 1992 biography of the richly-talented TV presenter and musical actor Phillip Schofield.</p> <p>\u0095 Going far, far beyond the call of duty, I've waded through the unabridged Andrew Neil rant about the Guardian over the article outlining how he's blown 120 of the Barclay's millions. In one section, Andrew appears to accuse our financial editor, Paul Murphy, who wrote the piece, of being drunk when the two met at Jeff Randall's Sunday Business leaving do.</p> <p>Andrew, you naughty boy, who was it who had the audience tittering by referring to Mr Randall leaving the Sunday Times? More water with it for you. As for your notion that the editors of this title and others called emergency meetings to discuss your whinge about horrid media diaries picking on you, for God's sake, man, grow up. No more whining. The last thing your heroine liked was a moaning minnie. Be a brave boy for Margaret.</p> <p>\u0095 In the Sun, Richard Littlejohn strives for fresh ground, turning his mind to homosexuality in connection with the new Monty biography. \"We're all repressing something - axe murderer, ballroom dancer. Who knows?\" writes Richard. \"I hate to think what they're going to say about me when I'm gone.\" Richard, old love, worry no more. They've been saying just that about you for years and years.</p> <p>\u0095 With her area of specialism going through a quiet spell, Times countryside editor Val Elliot calls concerning the resurgence of the microwave plug crisis (we reported yesterday, you will recall, how the plug was snipped off again and planted in Val's top right hand drawer while she was on holiday). Calling from a foot and mouth press conference, Val seems cross. \"This is ridiculous,\" she says. \"I haven't been on holiday. Don't you check your sources?\" Sorry, don't we what? \"It's not even funny.\" Oh. May we ask when you last did take a holiday? \"Er, I had two days off, if that counts as holiday.\" Right, thanks, Val.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 With the issue of freedom of speech and the local press in mind, we ask why his constituents never read a word about Alan Duncan's business ... his lucrative work for Marc Rich, for example, and for the Yemeni arms dealer Sheikh Ahmed Farid, as reported by the Sunday Times last August. So why, we ask Melton Times editor Andy Place, did not a word of this reach your readers? \"How well do you know Mr Duncan?\" asks Andy after a deep breath. \"We had no evidence that it was true. And he's got a lot more money than us, our dapper MP.\" The Rutland Times's Brian Martin tells us: \"Mr Duncan ... has quite often said he will take us to court, so we can't afford to print those things,\" while the Leicester Mercury editor Nick Carter went off the record to say much the same. As for Tim Robinson of the Stamford and Rutland Mercury, he seemed confused, first claiming he missed the story in August, and then insisting his news editor couldn't stand it up. Meanwhile, last week's Melton Times ran a photo of Little Alan posing with a packet of Fortnum's teabags (an imbecilic stunt; don't ask), and smiling broadly, tickled perhaps by the thought of our grotesque libel laws and how they make such a joke of freedom of speech. \u0095 I am delighted to announce the new Book of the Month for March. It is To Dream A Dream (Blake Publishing), Piers Morgan's no-holds-barred 1992 biography of the richly-talented TV presenter and musical actor Phillip Schofield. \u0095 Going far, far beyond the call of duty, I've waded through the unabridged Andrew Neil rant about the Guardian over the article outlining how he's blown 120 of the Barclay's millions. In one section, Andrew appears to accuse our financial editor, Paul Murphy, who wrote the piece, of being drunk when the two met at Jeff Randall's Sunday Business leaving do. Andrew, you naughty boy, who was it who had the audience tittering by referring to Mr Randall leaving the Sunday Times? More water with it for you. As for your notion that the editors of this title and others called emergency meetings to discuss your whinge about horrid media diaries picking on you, for God's sake, man, grow up. No more whining. The last thing your heroine liked was a moaning minnie. Be a brave boy for Margaret. \u0095 In the Sun, Richard Littlejohn strives for fresh ground, turning his mind to homosexuality in connection with the new Monty biography. \"We're all repressing something - axe murderer, ballroom dancer. Who knows?\" writes Richard. \"I hate to think what they're going to say about me when I'm gone.\" Richard, old love, worry no more. They've been saying just that about you for years and years. \u0095 With her area of specialism going through a quiet spell, Times countryside editor Val Elliot calls concerning the resurgence of the microwave plug crisis (we reported yesterday, you will recall, how the plug was snipped off again and planted in Val's top right hand drawer while she was on holiday). Calling from a foot and mouth press conference, Val seems cross. \"This is ridiculous,\" she says. \"I haven't been on holiday. Don't you check your sources?\" Sorry, don't we what? \"It's not even funny.\" Oh. May we ask when you last did take a holiday? \"Er, I had two days off, if that counts as holiday.\" Right, thanks, Val. Goodbye. \u0095 There is no space today, alas, for Marina's debate with Times managing editor George Brock, the dandy of Wapping, about what constitutes a tank top. Perhaps tomorrow. \u0095 Surveillance: the kangaroo suit needed to deliver Skippy Hammond's jigsaw, outside the Musicians Union headquarters at the Oval, south London, at about 2pm on Monday, in a protest about the suspension of an official.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In 1753 William Cobbett, chronicler of 18th century English rural life, stood on the downs above the Vale of Pewsey in Wiltshire and declared the patchwork of small fields, hedgerows, orchards and villages below him to be \"the promised land\".</p> <p>\"It is impossible,\" he wrote, \"to imagine any life more easy and happy than men might lead here if they were not tormented by an accursed system that takes the food from those that raise it and gives it to them who do nothing.\"</p> <p>Some 250 years later, as another economic system haunts the vale, Cobbett's vista of people and animals busy in the Pewsey fields is long gone. Today the animals are mostly reared indoors, there are few people working the land, the smallest viable farms in the area are mostly 400 acres or more, and many villages are half empty most of the week.</p> <p>The big farms are often owned by companies who employ contracters at planting and reaping time; the orchards have been mostly grubbed up because the five supermarkets who dominate the British food supply industry choose not to sell the fruit; and the downs are dominated by 4,000-acre farms owned by international businessmen and worked for wheat by \u00a3150,000 tractors aided by satellite navigation.</p> <p>The Vale of Pewsey, like almost every corner of Britain, has been globalised. The carrots in the local supermarket may have come from Spain, the apples from New Zealand, the flowers from Africa and the beans from Asia. The meat could be from Botswana or Brazil, the sheep reared on the downs may well be exported to the Middle East and the milk quite likely will be processed and sent to Africa.</p> <p>For the Pewsey farmers who cannot match the technology needed for intensive large-scale farming, or just the favourable climates in other places, the globalisation of agriculture spells ruin. In 1998 Clive Hibberd who farmed 200 acres at Oak farm got out after 40 years. \"I just cannot compete any more,\" he said.</p> <p>His neighbour, Alan Lathan of Wilds farm, was blunt: \"Outside economic forces have done me in. You have no control over prices, everything is set by outsiders. It doesn't matter how well you farm, it just gets harder and harder.\" He, too, has left.</p> <p>The same forces that affect Britain are sweeping through rural areas everywhere. The twin motors have been rapid globalisation, backed by world trade rules which are opening every market to international competition, and a system of subsidies that encourages intensification.</p> <p>Steve Gorelick, a US farmer and co-founder of the International Society for Ecology and Culture, said 235,000 farms and 60,000 rural companies in the US were driven out of business in the 1980s. The massive decline in farm income in Britain is matched in the US, where incomes halved between 1996-99 and suicide, says Mr Gorelick, is the commonest cause of death among farmers.</p> <p>In Europe 200,000 farmers left agriculture in 1999. In India farmers are unable to compete with cheap imports. Several hundred million Chinese have left the countryside for the cities in 20 years of agricultural modernisation.</p> <p>The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation says global agricultural trade is worth some \u00a3300bn a year and has almost doubled since 1980. The benefits of exporting food, say its advocates, are increased wealth and food supplies. Critics argue that countries' food \"security\" is undermined by making them dependent on others.</p> <p>Multinational corporations are also extending their power and control over agricultural production, making farmers dependent on them for seed, technological inputs, credit and outlets for their produce.</p> <p>The lion's share of global agribusiness has been snapped up by a few countries and companies. According to US author David Korten, 10 companies involved in seed, fertilisers, pesticides, processing, and shipments control more than 60% of the international food chain.</p> <p>\"One company, Cargill's, controls 80% of the world's grain supplies, four companies control 87% of US beef, five account for 65% of the global pesticide market, another four control the world's supply of corn, wheat, tobacco, tea, rice, pineapple, jute, timber and many other commodities,\" he says.</p> <p>In Britain, 80% of agricultural subsidies are taken by the largest 20% of farmers. In the US, says Peter Rosset of California-based agricultural think tank Food First, taxpayers subsidise the biggest 10% of farmers by more than $13bn a year - 60% of the total $22bn paid to US farmers directly. \"It's a transfer of money to large multinational corporate farmers who dominate the world trade,\" says Dr Rosset. \"They buy the grain, or whatever, at giveaway prices and use the subsidies to capture markets around the world and drive farmers out of business in Mexico, Africa, Asia and South America.\"</p> <p>Just as the small farmers cannot equally compete with the large players in Britain, so there is a similar disparity between the richest 16 countries and the rest of the world. OECD agricultural subsidies total almost $362bn a year, compared to less than one 20th of that for the rest of the world's countries.</p> <p>Increased transport distances between producers and consumers bring social and environmental costs, says Tim Lobstein of the Food Commission, an independent agricultural think tank.</p> <p>\"Take apples. We now consume more French than British ones.</p> <p>\"We have grubbed up half of our orchards since the 1950s and now bring in apples from Europe, New Zealand, South Africa, Chile and the US.

      "bodyText": "In 1753 William Cobbett, chronicler of 18th century English rural life, stood on the downs above the Vale of Pewsey in Wiltshire and declared the patchwork of small fields, hedgerows, orchards and villages below him to be \"the promised land\". \"It is impossible,\" he wrote, \"to imagine any life more easy and happy than men might lead here if they were not tormented by an accursed system that takes the food from those that raise it and gives it to them who do nothing.\" Some 250 years later, as another economic system haunts the vale, Cobbett's vista of people and animals busy in the Pewsey fields is long gone. Today the animals are mostly reared indoors, there are few people working the land, the smallest viable farms in the area are mostly 400 acres or more, and many villages are half empty most of the week. The big farms are often owned by companies who employ contracters at planting and reaping time; the orchards have been mostly grubbed up because the five supermarkets who dominate the British food supply industry choose not to sell the fruit; and the downs are dominated by 4,000-acre farms owned by international businessmen and worked for wheat by \u00a3150,000 tractors aided by satellite navigation. The Vale of Pewsey, like almost every corner of Britain, has been globalised. The carrots in the local supermarket may have come from Spain, the apples from New Zealand, the flowers from Africa and the beans from Asia. The meat could be from Botswana or Brazil, the sheep reared on the downs may well be exported to the Middle East and the milk quite likely will be processed and sent to Africa. For the Pewsey farmers who cannot match the technology needed for intensive large-scale farming, or just the favourable climates in other places, the globalisation of agriculture spells ruin. In 1998 Clive Hibberd who farmed 200 acres at Oak farm got out after 40 years. \"I just cannot compete any more,\" he said. His neighbour, Alan Lathan of Wilds farm, was blunt: \"Outside economic forces have done me in. You have no control over prices, everything is set by outsiders. It doesn't matter how well you farm, it just gets harder and harder.\" He, too, has left. The same forces that affect Britain are sweeping through rural areas everywhere. The twin motors have been rapid globalisation, backed by world trade rules which are opening every market to international competition, and a system of subsidies that encourages intensification. Steve Gorelick, a US farmer and co-founder of the International Society for Ecology and Culture, said 235,000 farms and 60,000 rural companies in the US were driven out of business in the 1980s. The massive decline in farm income in Britain is matched in the US, where incomes halved between 1996-99 and suicide, says Mr Gorelick, is the commonest cause of death among farmers. In Europe 200,000 farmers left agriculture in 1999. In India farmers are unable to compete with cheap imports. Several hundred million Chinese have left the countryside for the cities in 20 years of agricultural modernisation. The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation says global agricultural trade is worth some \u00a3300bn a year and has almost doubled since 1980. The benefits of exporting food, say its advocates, are increased wealth and food supplies. Critics argue that countries' food \"security\" is undermined by making them dependent on others. Multinational corporations are also extending their power and control over agricultural production, making farmers dependent on them for seed, technological inputs, credit and outlets for their produce. The lion's share of global agribusiness has been snapped up by a few countries and companies. According to US author David Korten, 10 companies involved in seed, fertilisers, pesticides, processing, and shipments control more than 60% of the international food chain. \"One company, Cargill's, controls 80% of the world's grain supplies, four companies control 87% of US beef, five account for 65% of the global pesticide market, another four control the world's supply of corn, wheat, tobacco, tea, rice, pineapple, jute, timber and many other commodities,\" he says.

      "body": "<p>In 1939, Britain could still be called a nation of small farmers. There were almost 500,000 farms, the majority fewer than 100 acres and worked by families. Between them they employed up to 15% of the population. The rural economy revolved around them, they were a significant political and social force and their standing in the community was generally high.</p> <p>Within 30 years, the number of farms had almost halved and by 1990 fewer than a quarter of the farmworkers had survived. In the last 10 years the number of farms has fallen a further 25% from 233,000 to 168,000.</p> <p>The latest figures suggest that 42,000 farmers and farmworkers have left the industry in the past two years. Today about 2% of the workforce is actively engaged in farming.</p> <p>In Ireland, a government inquiry into the state of small farms recently found that the numbers had declined by 90% in the last 20 years and that dairy farmers had fallen from 212,000 in 1974 to fewer than 30,000 today.</p> <p>\"The pressure on small farms is becoming more and more acute,\" it reported. \"Only 20-30% of farmers can hope to make a profit and 37% cannot even get the minimum wage for agricultural workers. Yet 70% of the rural population continue to be largely dependent on agriculture.\"</p> <p>Similarly, in mainland Europe, 200,000 farmers gave up agriculture in 1999.</p> <p>But we may have seen nothing yet, says Michael Hart, of the Small Farms Alliance. \"We have lost a third of all family farms in the past decade.

      "bodyText": "In 1939, Britain could still be called a nation of small farmers. There were almost 500,000 farms, the majority fewer than 100 acres and worked by families. Between them they employed up to 15% of the population. The rural economy revolved around them, they were a significant political and social force and their standing in the community was generally high. Within 30 years, the number of farms had almost halved and by 1990 fewer than a quarter of the farmworkers had survived. In the last 10 years the number of farms has fallen a further 25% from 233,000 to 168,000. The latest figures suggest that 42,000 farmers and farmworkers have left the industry in the past two years. Today about 2% of the workforce is actively engaged in farming. In Ireland, a government inquiry into the state of small farms recently found that the numbers had declined by 90% in the last 20 years and that dairy farmers had fallen from 212,000 in 1974 to fewer than 30,000 today. \"The pressure on small farms is becoming more and more acute,\" it reported. \"Only 20-30% of farmers can hope to make a profit and 37% cannot even get the minimum wage for agricultural workers. Yet 70% of the rural population continue to be largely dependent on agriculture.\" Similarly, in mainland Europe, 200,000 farmers gave up agriculture in 1999. But we may have seen nothing yet, says Michael Hart, of the Small Farms Alliance. \"We have lost a third of all family farms in the past decade. There are still 100,000 under 120 acres, but more and more farmers are going part-time just to survive.\" Ironically, small farms have been shown in study after study in Britain, the US and India to be more productive per acre, less polluting, better for employment and wildlife and environmental diversity. In Britain \"the government does not recognise the small farmer at all,\" says Mr Hart. \"They see us purely in economic terms and say you're inefficient and must intensify. They take the line that it is inevitable that we will go. They have told us to diversify but they offer no way forward. They have done almost nothing to help us.\" Without the small farm, production, distribution, sales and the rise of new ideas like organic farming becomes more and more concentrated into the hands of the few. \"I can foresee the time when there are fewer than 10,000 people making decisions about farming in Britain,\" said one large-scale contract farmer.

      "bodyText": "Washington used a visit to Nato headquarters by the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, yesterday to send it clearest signal yet that it has no real problem with European Union plans to create a rapid reaction force. In effect handing a pre-election gift to Tony Blair, Mr Powell told Nato foreign ministers that the Bush administration genuinely welcomed Europe's new defence initiative, and did not regard it as a threat. \"The United States supports and welcomes the creation of a European defence facility, and believes that as long as it avoids duplication measures and has some kind of joint planning arrangements with Nato that it will actually enhance and strengthen the alliance's capabilities,\" he is reported to have said. Mr Powell went out of his way to hammer home the point at the extraordinary meeting of the North Atlantic Council, stressing that his view was shared by the entire Bush administration, including such ultra-conservatives as the national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, and the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. His positive attitude to the European security and defence initiative (ESDI) delighted Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, who said Mr Powell had defused the issue, once and for all. \"It puts to bed any idea that there is going to be division between Europe and the United States on security,\" Mr Cook said. The Nato secretary general, Lord Robertson, also said the matter was no longer a source of contention, undermining the claim by the Tories that the plan to create a 60,000-strong force for crisis management and peacekeeping operations threatens Britain's \"special relationship\" with the United States. \"At present, if Europe wants to act, it's Nato or nothing, and that means the US or nothing,\" he said. \"There can be and will be no substitute for Nato, which remains the cornerstone of European defence. \"But it's right that Europe should have the ability to act together when Nato as a whole is not engaged, and there is no difference between the US and Europe on this.\" Nevertheless, the shadow defence minister, Iain Duncan Smith, continued to argue that the new \"Euro army\" would be independent of Nato in terms of planning, and said that France for one was adamant that this was the way forward. But the French foreign minister, Hubert V\u00e9drine, who met Mr Powell yesterday, sounded a more conciliatory note, avoiding the sometimes contentious detail surrounding the issue while defending the rapid reaction force. \"The risk to Nato, to the transatlantic link and to the Euro-American relationship, does not stem from what Europe is building. The risk could only come from Europe not doing it,\" he said. Mr Powell left his audience in no doubt, however, that the controversial US plans for a national missile defence shield - dubbed Son of Star Wars - remain firmly on track, and he stepped up the US effort to ease the increasing European fear that the development could bring about a new arms race. \"We believe that it is our responsibility to have a missile defence shield to protect the United States and our friends and allies from rogue states,\" Mr Powell said. He added that Washington was happy to consult other governments before moving ahead with the project. But he said that the threat presented by rogue states such as Iraq and Iran was very real and necessitated a military response. That was a widely recognised fact in Europe, and even in Russia, he said.",

      "bodyText": "Zimbabwe's white chief justice refused to be sacked and replaced by a government supporter yesterday, setting the stage for a potentially violent struggle with President Robert Mugabe for control of the courts. The government's dismissal, of Anthony Gubbay was to have been the first step in a wider purge of judges who refuse to sanction the confiscation of white-owned farms, the oppression of political opponents, and the official flouting of the rule of law. The justice minister, Patrick Chinamasa, accused Mr Gubbay of misconduct and said he would be replaced tomorrow by a prominent Zanu-PF supporter, Godfrey Chidyausiku. But Mr Gubbay said that would be illegal, and he would not vacate his court or official residence. Earlier this month, his safety threatened by Mr Chinamasa, Mr Gubbay agreed to take early retirement in June. The government is preparing to set up a disciplinary panel to sack other supreme court and high court judges who are considered to have a \"Rhodesian mind-set\". Whoever is chief justice will preside over the panel, and the government is apparently keen to ensure that its man is in place. Mr Gubbay's lawyer issued a statement saying he opposed \"the unlawful demands made by the minister of justice for him to vacate his chambers and house and any further unlawful action the minister of justice may take\". Mr Gubbay says he is now reconsidering his agreement to early retirement. The information minister, Jonathan Moyo, justified the plan to remove judges by saying that Jews would not accept their \"former Nazi tormentors\" judging them. The chairman of Zimbabwe's bar council, Adrian de Bourbon, backed Mr Gubbay. \"They pushed him too far and he decided to fight back. I don't know how the government is going to react to this,\" he said. Britain has pressed the EU and the Commonwealth to confront Mr Mugabe. Sweden, which holds the EU presidency, says it is starting a \"critical dialogue\" with Mr Mugabe through its ambassador in Harare. The Commonwealth will send a team to investigate human rights abuses. But it is to South Africa that many are looking, after President Thabo Mbeki bowed to growing criticism from foreign business interests, trade union allies and the judiciary of his policy of \"constructive engagement\" with Mr Mugabe. Mr Mbeki said he would meet the Zimbabwean president soon to express concern at the increasing repression. \"We continue to be concerned about the situation in Zimbabwe,\" he said. \"Some of the things that have been happening recently are to all of us as South Africans of very serious concern: things that are affecting the judges, affecting the press, apart from earlier questions to do with the land redistribution.\"",

      "body": "<p>The problem with being a bridge is that you risk getting trampled on at both ends. Thus Tony Blair, with a foot in two camps but especially Camp David, is criticised on the European side for giving in to George Bush over missile defences and on the American side for hoodwinking that trusting Texan over the EU's plan for a rapid reaction force. Nato chief George Robertson is another exponent of balancing acts. Speaking in Brussels yesterday during a fleeting state visit by Colin Powell, he dismissed fears of an alliance split by the RRF plan. \"There can be and will be no substitute for Nato,\" he intoned. This is a kind of mantra for Lord Robertson, to be repeated at bedtime perhaps and twice on Sundays. Indeed, the very fact that he loses no opportunity to stress \"the vital importance of the transatlantic link\" in Europe's security arrangements raises suspicions that at heart he knows it is a lot less vital now than, say, a dozen years ago when the Soviet empire menaced one and all.</p> <p>In reassuring the Americans that nothing has changed, Lord Robertson, like Mr Blair, risks upending the seesaw and leaving French legs (and others) dangling in mid-air. The EU is perfectly entitled to create an autonomous defence force. It could even supplant the alliance one distant day. What is less clear is whether the Nato of the two Georges will be entitled, politically speaking, to veto its future activities. \"Assets and capabilities\", mutters Lord Robertson, pointing up Europe's lack of them. \"It's unrealistic to imagine the US is going to give assets without any say over how those assets are used.\" But it is also unrealistic to believe that Washington's dominant role in European security, projected via Nato, will be indefinitely upheld by privately despised, subservient allies whose own capabilities are evolving and whose legitimate interests may be diverging.</p> <p>While the US is simultaneously advocating missile systems of dubious utility but certain disruptiveness, antagonising Russia (not least by Nato's enlargement), and pursuing a half-hearted approach to Balkans peacekeeping, doubts about the alliance's indispensability to Europe will only grow. The message for Mr Powell to take home is that Europe, slowly but perceptibly (and rightly), is moving towards its own ideas of collective defence. To try to impose unilateral limits on that risks burning alliance bridges, not building them. Memo to the two Georges, cc. Tony: nothing is forever, not even Nato.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The problem with being a bridge is that you risk getting trampled on at both ends. Thus Tony Blair, with a foot in two camps but especially Camp David, is criticised on the European side for giving in to George Bush over missile defences and on the American side for hoodwinking that trusting Texan over the EU's plan for a rapid reaction force. Nato chief George Robertson is another exponent of balancing acts. Speaking in Brussels yesterday during a fleeting state visit by Colin Powell, he dismissed fears of an alliance split by the RRF plan. \"There can be and will be no substitute for Nato,\" he intoned. This is a kind of mantra for Lord Robertson, to be repeated at bedtime perhaps and twice on Sundays. Indeed, the very fact that he loses no opportunity to stress \"the vital importance of the transatlantic link\" in Europe's security arrangements raises suspicions that at heart he knows it is a lot less vital now than, say, a dozen years ago when the Soviet empire menaced one and all. In reassuring the Americans that nothing has changed, Lord Robertson, like Mr Blair, risks upending the seesaw and leaving French legs (and others) dangling in mid-air. The EU is perfectly entitled to create an autonomous defence force. It could even supplant the alliance one distant day. What is less clear is whether the Nato of the two Georges will be entitled, politically speaking, to veto its future activities. \"Assets and capabilities\", mutters Lord Robertson, pointing up Europe's lack of them. \"It's unrealistic to imagine the US is going to give assets without any say over how those assets are used.\" But it is also unrealistic to believe that Washington's dominant role in European security, projected via Nato, will be indefinitely upheld by privately despised, subservient allies whose own capabilities are evolving and whose legitimate interests may be diverging. While the US is simultaneously advocating missile systems of dubious utility but certain disruptiveness, antagonising Russia (not least by Nato's enlargement), and pursuing a half-hearted approach to Balkans peacekeeping, doubts about the alliance's indispensability to Europe will only grow. The message for Mr Powell to take home is that Europe, slowly but perceptibly (and rightly), is moving towards its own ideas of collective defence. To try to impose unilateral limits on that risks burning alliance bridges, not building them. Memo to the two Georges, cc. Tony: nothing is forever, not even Nato.",

Even the Conservatives have abandoned their plans to privatise it in the face of unremittingly hostile public opinion. Practically anyone who is anyone is against it except for one very important man: Gordon Brown.</p> <p>The chancellor - and, to be fair, his department - are implacably opposed even though they know they have lost the argument with electors. They passionately believe that their public/private partnership model would not only leave most of the tube in public hands but would, for the first time, ensure that cost overruns on public projects are met by the private sector and not the taxpayer as happened with the Jubilee extension, which doubled in cost.</p> <p>If this were true it would be a formidable argument. But opponents simply don't believe that the Treasury has found a solution to the endemic problem of controlling large projects. It points to the Channel Tunnel, a private sector project that doubled in cost, and the fast rail link to the channel that the private sector wouldn't build without a Treasury guarantee. It suggests Mr Brown and his colleagues should drop their political objections to Ken Livingstone and take the TGV on a journey around France ending up with the Paris M\u00e9tro to see for themselves how government money and control can produce enviable results.</p> <p>Tony Blair must sort this mess out very quickly. Not because there is an election in the offing but because London's collapsing transport infrastructure demands a speedy solution. If the Treasury, which has been remarkably shy to argue its own case in public, really thinks it has right on its side then it should speak up or shut up. But its case will need to be good. In Bob Kiley, London appears to have found the right man for the right job at the right time. And time is something that suffering underground passengers do not have on their side.</p>",

      "bodyText": "More than 80% of Londoners are opposed to the government's part-privatisation of the underground system. Even the Conservatives have abandoned their plans to privatise it in the face of unremittingly hostile public opinion. Practically anyone who is anyone is against it except for one very important man: Gordon Brown. The chancellor - and, to be fair, his department - are implacably opposed even though they know they have lost the argument with electors. They passionately believe that their public/private partnership model would not only leave most of the tube in public hands but would, for the first time, ensure that cost overruns on public projects are met by the private sector and not the taxpayer as happened with the Jubilee extension, which doubled in cost. If this were true it would be a formidable argument. But opponents simply don't believe that the Treasury has found a solution to the endemic problem of controlling large projects. It points to the Channel Tunnel, a private sector project that doubled in cost, and the fast rail link to the channel that the private sector wouldn't build without a Treasury guarantee. It suggests Mr Brown and his colleagues should drop their political objections to Ken Livingstone and take the TGV on a journey around France ending up with the Paris M\u00e9tro to see for themselves how government money and control can produce enviable results. Tony Blair must sort this mess out very quickly. Not because there is an election in the offing but because London's collapsing transport infrastructure demands a speedy solution. If the Treasury, which has been remarkably shy to argue its own case in public, really thinks it has right on its side then it should speak up or shut up. But its case will need to be good. In Bob Kiley, London appears to have found the right man for the right job at the right time. And time is something that suffering underground passengers do not have on their side.",

      "byline": "Michael White and Patrick Wintour",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>William Hague will abandon Conservative plans to privatise the London Underground today, intensifying speculation that Michael Portillo is strengthening his grip on party policy - and pushing towards the centre ground.</p> <p>The announcement, leaked last night, prompted the Tory right to claim that Mr Hague is increasingly a prisoner of his shadow chancellor who is busily courting what remains of the party's leftwing at Westminster with a view to a post-election leadership contest.</p> <p>Faced with the deepening unpopularity of privatisation in the wake of Railtrack's problems, the Tories have decided to give their support to the alternative being proposed by Bob Kiley, the transport commissioner appointed by London's mayor, Ken Livingstone.</p> <p>The latest Tory u-turn comes as Tony Blair struggles to get Mr Kiley the overall manage ment control he seeks within the broad framework of John Prescott's public/private partnership for revitalising the long-neglected underground.</p> <p>Mr Kiley, an American whose smooth-talking popularity the Tories acknowledge, could be asked to chair a management board on which the three private firms running the underground will sit. \"We've got to give this man a fair wind,\" one Hague aide said last night.</p> <p>Within the Conservatives, the responsibility for junking the privatisation plan originally drawn up by John Redwood lies with the shadow environment secretary, Archie Norman, and his transport spokesman, Bernard Jenkin - though Mr Portillo and Mr Hague have endorsed it.</p> <p>The Redwood plan would have created park-and-ride schemes, competing underground lines, user-friendly stations and - in theory - given \u00a3750m back to the Treasury. Hague advisers said last night that \"events have moved on\" and that practical politics dictate that Mr Kiley deserves a chance.</p> <p>Mr Redwood, former Welsh secretary and a failed Tory leadership candidate, thinks it is disastrous that some colleagues continue to speculate about Mr Hague's future so close to a spring election, when 56% of voters are said to be dissatisfied with his performance as party leader. \"It's stupid and deeply disloyal,\" one Redwood supporter said.</p> <p>Talk about a post-election leadership contest infuriates the Portillo camp, which says it is powerless to prevent people claiming to be \"friends of Michael\" spreading stories which they say are damaging both to him and to the authority of Mr Hague, already battered by polls which show him trailing up to 20% behind Labour under Tony Blair.</p> <p>\"There are no outriders licensed to speak for Michael,\" advisers said last night. The finger of suspicion is largely directed at a wider group of supporters.

      "bodyText": "William Hague will abandon Conservative plans to privatise the London Underground today, intensifying speculation that Michael Portillo is strengthening his grip on party policy - and pushing towards the centre ground. The announcement, leaked last night, prompted the Tory right to claim that Mr Hague is increasingly a prisoner of his shadow chancellor who is busily courting what remains of the party's leftwing at Westminster with a view to a post-election leadership contest. Faced with the deepening unpopularity of privatisation in the wake of Railtrack's problems, the Tories have decided to give their support to the alternative being proposed by Bob Kiley, the transport commissioner appointed by London's mayor, Ken Livingstone. The latest Tory u-turn comes as Tony Blair struggles to get Mr Kiley the overall manage ment control he seeks within the broad framework of John Prescott's public/private partnership for revitalising the long-neglected underground. Mr Kiley, an American whose smooth-talking popularity the Tories acknowledge, could be asked to chair a management board on which the three private firms running the underground will sit. \"We've got to give this man a fair wind,\" one Hague aide said last night. Within the Conservatives, the responsibility for junking the privatisation plan originally drawn up by John Redwood lies with the shadow environment secretary, Archie Norman, and his transport spokesman, Bernard Jenkin - though Mr Portillo and Mr Hague have endorsed it. The Redwood plan would have created park-and-ride schemes, competing underground lines, user-friendly stations and - in theory - given \u00a3750m back to the Treasury. Hague advisers said last night that \"events have moved on\" and that practical politics dictate that Mr Kiley deserves a chance. Mr Redwood, former Welsh secretary and a failed Tory leadership candidate, thinks it is disastrous that some colleagues continue to speculate about Mr Hague's future so close to a spring election, when 56% of voters are said to be dissatisfied with his performance as party leader. \"It's stupid and deeply disloyal,\" one Redwood supporter said. Talk about a post-election leadership contest infuriates the Portillo camp, which says it is powerless to prevent people claiming to be \"friends of Michael\" spreading stories which they say are damaging both to him and to the authority of Mr Hague, already battered by polls which show him trailing up to 20% behind Labour under Tony Blair. \"There are no outriders licensed to speak for Michael,\" advisers said last night. The finger of suspicion is largely directed at a wider group of supporters. But Mr Portillo's decision to address the Mainstream group of Tory moderates at next weekend's spring conference in Harrogate has also contributed to the speculation about his intentions. Moderate MPs have been making friendlier noises about Mr Portillo since he embraced a socially inclusive agenda. That, too, has offended the right. Ann Widdecombe is not seen as whispering against \"William\" and believes he will survive if he can win 40 seats and get the Conservatives back above 200 MPs. But some MPs say Iain Duncan Smith and David Davis, both on the right, are quietly positioning themselves in case Mr Hague is voted out by MPs. Tory jitters about their party's likely fate in an election were enhanced last night by private Liberal Democrat polling among 1,200 voters in key seats. The results are said to show that 66% think Mr Hague would say anything to get elected. His personal ratings are reported to be low among voters in terms of qualities of leadership and honesty.",

      "bodyText": "George Bush gave American voters and the watchful financial markets the sort of upbeat economic message they most love to hear yesterday: they were so well off that they could afford to have it all. A widely trailed budget speech to the joint houses of Congress last night had him telling Americans he would spend billions more dollars on education and defence and allow them to invest parts of their state pensions in private sector funds. To do this, he looked likely to change one article of faith previously shared by Republicans and Democrats - that the federal government debt should be eliminated as soon as possible. Aiming to repay only part of what is owed would help give him room for his $1,600bn (\u00a31,100bn) tax-cut giveaway during the coming decade. Financial and political analysts will be poring over the fine print of Mr Bush's address, which he called a \"blue print for new beginnings\", trying to work out its likely impact in America and beyond. In particular, attention will be fixed on whether the tax bonanza will do enough, fast enough, to head off a US-led global economic downturn. Mr Bush's $1,900bn budget for 2002 is seen by friend and foe as the most important political initiative of his first phase in the White House. At its centre is the tax-cutting package which public opinion polls say Americans do not especially want - a Washington Post survey yesterday showed just 22% of Americans see it as a top priority - but which the Republicans believe holds the key to their election battles against the Democrats in 2002 and 2004. The latest figures showed US consumer confidence falling to a four-year low yesterday. Whether Mr Bush can deliver the best of all worlds to all Americans - and whether this can stave off recession in European and Asian markets - is open to question. His budget plans depend heavily on a projected $5,600bn surplus in the federal budget in the next 10 years. Those projections will look doubtful if the US economic downturn develops - and will go up in smoke if the US slides into recession. The most striking new aspect of Mr Bush's budget is that it backs away from the goal of eliminating the federal debt as soon as possible. The debt stands at $3,400bn and is expected to fall to $3,200bn by the start of the next financial year in the spring of 2002. But instead of reiterating the view that it should be paid off in just over a decade, Mr Bush last night said he aimed to eliminate $2,000bn of it in that time, leaving $1,200bn outstanding.

      "bodyText": "Nato agreed to a \"phased\" reduction in the buffer zone preventing Serb forces from coming within three miles of Kosovo as concern about the activities of extremist ethnic Albanians in the area increased yesterday. The decision was taken at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers attended by the US secretary of state, Colin Powell. \"The United States will participate in whatever action the alliance believes is necessary,\" he said. He said the message to ethnic Albanian extremists was: \"This is not the time to start a new conflict in Europe.\" Lord Robertson, Nato's secretary general, said military advisers would work out how to plan a \"phased and conditioned reduction of the ground safety zone\". The Yugoslav president, Vojislav Kostunica, has proposed that the demilitarised zone, from which all Serb forces except lightly armed police are banned, should be abolished. British defence officials have suggested that EU troops and police should combine forces with Serb soldiers to control attacks by Albanian guerrillas. Tension has increased since K-For stepped up patrols in the autumn after ethnic Albanian militiamen began trying to take over three Albanian towns in southern Serbia.",

While fighting between Serb police and ethnic Albanian guerrillas continues in the Presevo valley on the north-eastern border of Kosovo, the new conflict is threatening to destabilise neighbouring Macedonia on the south-eastern border. It has already claimed one life. The guerrillas fighting the Macedonian army have warned of an \"explosion\" of violence in the region and one gunman assured the Guardian: \"We are not afraid.\" He spoke as two hours of intense fighting raged on Monday between the newly formed ethnic Albanian National Liberation Army (NLA) and Macedonian forces. The NLA, which has the same command structure as the former Kosovo Liberation Army, emerged only six weeks ago from the village of Tanusevc, just inside the Macedonian border. Monday's exchange of fire, which included grenade-launchers and light artillery, prompted frightened women and children to flee across the border into Kosovo; more than 300 people have left their homes here in the past week. The situation prompted the Macedonian president, Boris Trajkovski, to go on national television and warn that the NLA could \"jeopardise Macedonia's stability\". Although diplomats fear that the fighting could easily spread across the country, in which a quarter of the population is Albanian, the guerrillas' roots are clearly inside Kosovo. It is possible that the fighting is motivated as much by personal gain as nationalist idealism: the borders between Macedonia, Serbia and Kosovo are well-troden smuggling routes. British Royal Marines seized \u00a31m worth of contraband cigarettes in the area late last month. But with two ethnic Albanian guerrilla armies in southern Serbia and Macedonia, the UN-administered province is thought to be an convenient springboard for the operations of Albanian nationalists. Furthermore, the Nato-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo, K-For, seems unable, and in some cases unwilling, to tackle the problem. Both guerrilla groups are operating along boundaries that fall within the United States army's area of responsibility. Although its troops are theoretically responsible for patrolling the frontier with Macedonia, it has imposed a one-mile exclusion zone to prevent them straying across the frontier. This \"forced-protection\" measure has effectively given the NLA the freedom to go in and out of Kosovo as it pleases. The group's staging post is said to be Vitina, an unimpressive Kosovan town five miles north of the Macedonian border. It is there, according to K-For and UN, that the NLA has set up recruitment and fundraising centres for associated rebel groups in southern Serbia and Macedonia. Dimitri Mandjavidze, director of the Vitina office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), says the town is the main supply route for the Albanian guerrilla army in southern Serbia, known as the UCPMB. Two men, Xhavit Hassani and Skender Habbibi, are alleged to be at the core of these activities. Mr Hassani, who comes from Tanusevc, was arrested last year by the UN police and deported to Skopje, accused of shooting a policemen. Four Macedonian border guards, taken hostage near Tanusevc at about the same time, were freed when he was released on bail. Several Macedonian newspapers accuse Mr Hassani of being the leader of the NLA, a charge he denies. Mr Habbibi was arrested earlier this month by US troops and is being kept in a military prison for allegedly recruiting men to \"raise funds\" for the Albanian guerrillas fighting in the Presevo valley. His arrest prompted protests in Vitina on February 7 and four arson attacks on Serb properties near the UN and OSCE compounds in the town. \"This was clearly an attempt to put pressure on us, the international community, to release [Mr Habbibi], and steer clear of their activities,\" one official said. The UN police claim that extortion rackets have been set up to help fund the guerrillas' activities. The UCPMB itself admits it is receiving donations from a revived fund used before and during the war in Kosovo, called The Homeland Calling. \"They were always collecting money ... It's nothing surprising,\" a local shopowner, Dimitri Mandjavidze, said, admitting that he had given some money to an anonymous fund. \"It is seen as being for the good of Kosovo Albanians.

One 14-year-old member of the group said Marsh yanked off the woman's top to expose her breasts. The victim described how a girl, believed to be Marsh, laughed throughout her ordeal and rallied the rapists - one of whom approached \"with a smile on his face\" - with the cry, \"go on, give her some\". The extent of Marsh's alleged involvement during the savage attack in west London last summer emerged during a trial at Blackfriars crown court, central London, yesterday in which she was jointly charged, with four others, with rape. Although it is not the first time in British legal history that a woman has been charged with rape, Marsh is believed to be the youngest charged with the offence. Scotland Yard holds no statistics on the exceptionally rare crime of women raping women. Marvin Edwards, 18, from Brentford, west London, and a 15-year-old, have already admitted the offence, but Marsh, together with a 16-year-old and another 15-year-old, are also being tried on the grounds that they were part of a \"joint enterprise\" and played some part in it.

The woman said she met a young woman with short dark hair - believed to be Marsh - and a black youth as she crossed the canal after an evening's drinking, fell into a conversation, and \"stupidly\" agreed to join them when they suggested smoking cannabis. At first the mood seemed \"jovial\" and she danced along the towpath, but after eight other people, including up to three girls, joined them the atmosphere altered and she decided it would be better to return home.

      "bodyText": "The Hollywood heartthrob Harrison Ford is to be paid more than $1m a day for his next film, producers last night confirmed, adding fuel to a furore over the \"obscene\" pay demands of top stars. With Hollywood on the brink of strikes over pay by actors and writers, moves which threaten to bring all US productions to a halt, news that Ford, 58, will be paid $25m (\u00a317.3m) for 20 days' work on K-19: The Widowmaker, will cause consternation. The thriller is based on the true story of a Russian nuclear submarine commander who averted a reactor meltdown when his vessel ran into trouble off Shetland in 1961. Actors further down the food chain claim their pay is being squeezed to meet the demands of the five highest earning male leads, who are now habitually commanding in excess of $20m (\u00a314m) a film. Such is the groundswell of anger that at last year's Cannes film festival, Nick Nolte, once a member of that gilded club, broke ranks to rage at the \"obscene\" amounts being paid. He said: \"It's sick. I want nothing to do with it.\" Ford's $2,500-an-hour rate smashes the record set by Marlon Brando, who collected $3m for four days' work on Superman in 1978. It also dwarfs the $25m paid to Mel Gibson for the month he spent shooting The Patriot, a deal which prompted Jim Wiatt, of the powerful William Morris agency, to warn that studios would go under if wages continued to spiral. Ford's agent claimed his payments did not take into account the time he spent researching the part, including a trip to Moscow to meet Captain Nikolai Zateyev, the hero of the incident. The film's producer Tim Kelly, of National Geographic Films, said Ford, who made his name playing understated heroes such as Han Solo in Star Wars and Indiana Jones, was worth every penny. \"We would have paid anything to get Harrison Ford on board. He guarantees a hit,\" he said. Before his fee became known, Ford said he took the part because of the film's gripping plot, its parallels with the Kursk tragedy, and the opportunity to star alongside Liam Neeson. \"The cash didn't tempt me.

      "body": "<p>D-day today: just as the forecast blizzard hit us at 10am, Peter set off to collect the much-needed disinfectant from the agricultural store 12 miles away. He left with the phone and a large shovel, but with no farmer available to clear the roads or pull stuck cars out of drifts, he knew it would not be an easy journey. He made it back eventually but said he would not go out again, and that 29 farmers on the list are still without disinfectant.</p> <p>We had got up just after 6am, neither of us having slept very well: I don't imagine anyone in the industry does just now. Breakfast is always accompanied by the television news, but it is the same over and over again. We are constantly bombarded with new information from the fax, phone, television, radio and internet, and keeping on top of it all is becoming a full-time job.</p> <p>Yesterday, we watched Peter's cousin, Michael Bell, on the news. He runs a livestock haulage business and this stoppage is really hurting him. He employs 20 staff and his six stock wagons are stationary. We are very conscious that it is not just the farmers who are hurting, that there are many others in the supply chain, from farm gate to plate, but only the livestock farmers have this gruesome fear of the destruction and burning of their animals.</p> <p>We got the detailed sheep symptoms down the fax today, and were very dismayed at lunchtime to hear the further spread to Lancashire, Durham and Northants. We almost know the sheep symptoms off by heart, but since the flock is now obliterated in near white-out conditions, it's not much help.</p> <p>I fear things really are going to get worse as the livestock movement ban is extended throughout the UK, and our hopes for future exports diminish hour by hour. We produce prime lambs for sale from July to November, and 25% of this country's sheep meat is exported, so I wonder what the effect will be on prices, and how many of us will not be lambing or selling sheep this year.</p> <p>I talked to some of our nearest neighbours last night and they are really scared. Roly Carr's fields are next to ours and he has cows due to calve imminently. He bought six last year at Longtown Mart in Cumbria, from Willy Cleave in Devon. That is how the livestock industry works: there are trading links from one end of the country to the other. Roly says he can't settle to anything. Peter and I are just the same. Roly expressed the great sadness we all feel and said how very attached he is to some of his cattle. Some of his suckler cows are real characters, almost like friends. It makes it so hard for us all.</p> <p>Our region is also besieged by the media, and there are genuine concerns about the endless camera shots of different farms and schools in the area. Is the same crew driving from scene to scene? I sincerely hope not. I expect today's snow will slow them down a little.</p> <p>I am very impressed by the courage of Ian Williamson from Ponteland: he is an example to us all. He has lost all his stock and yet he told the nation Britain needs food, and he intends to continue. We all wish him and his sons good luck for the future: they deserve it.</p> <p>Another farmer three miles from here, Alan Lawson, has finally agreed to be interviewed at his gate today by Granada and take a camcorder around the livestock. He breeds pedigree Suffolk rams and Charolais cattle, as well as keeping commercial livestock like ours. His wife, Anne, is a very popular and successful registered childminder, and all her tiny charges from farms are currently barred from attending, so now the industry's much-needed diversification enterprises are also being affected.</p> <p>There could be an outbreak of cabin-fever soon among folk stuck on their farms.

      "bodyText": "D-day today: just as the forecast blizzard hit us at 10am, Peter set off to collect the much-needed disinfectant from the agricultural store 12 miles away. He left with the phone and a large shovel, but with no farmer available to clear the roads or pull stuck cars out of drifts, he knew it would not be an easy journey. He made it back eventually but said he would not go out again, and that 29 farmers on the list are still without disinfectant. We had got up just after 6am, neither of us having slept very well: I don't imagine anyone in the industry does just now. Breakfast is always accompanied by the television news, but it is the same over and over again. We are constantly bombarded with new information from the fax, phone, television, radio and internet, and keeping on top of it all is becoming a full-time job. Yesterday, we watched Peter's cousin, Michael Bell, on the news. He runs a livestock haulage business and this stoppage is really hurting him. He employs 20 staff and his six stock wagons are stationary. We are very conscious that it is not just the farmers who are hurting, that there are many others in the supply chain, from farm gate to plate, but only the livestock farmers have this gruesome fear of the destruction and burning of their animals. We got the detailed sheep symptoms down the fax today, and were very dismayed at lunchtime to hear the further spread to Lancashire, Durham and Northants. We almost know the sheep symptoms off by heart, but since the flock is now obliterated in near white-out conditions, it's not much help. I fear things really are going to get worse as the livestock movement ban is extended throughout the UK, and our hopes for future exports diminish hour by hour. We produce prime lambs for sale from July to November, and 25% of this country's sheep meat is exported, so I wonder what the effect will be on prices, and how many of us will not be lambing or selling sheep this year. I talked to some of our nearest neighbours last night and they are really scared. Roly Carr's fields are next to ours and he has cows due to calve imminently. He bought six last year at Longtown Mart in Cumbria, from Willy Cleave in Devon. That is how the livestock industry works: there are trading links from one end of the country to the other. Roly says he can't settle to anything. Peter and I are just the same. Roly expressed the great sadness we all feel and said how very attached he is to some of his cattle. Some of his suckler cows are real characters, almost like friends. It makes it so hard for us all. Our region is also besieged by the media, and there are genuine concerns about the endless camera shots of different farms and schools in the area. Is the same crew driving from scene to scene? I sincerely hope not. I expect today's snow will slow them down a little. I am very impressed by the courage of Ian Williamson from Ponteland: he is an example to us all. He has lost all his stock and yet he told the nation Britain needs food, and he intends to continue. We all wish him and his sons good luck for the future: they deserve it. Another farmer three miles from here, Alan Lawson, has finally agreed to be interviewed at his gate today by Granada and take a camcorder around the livestock. He breeds pedigree Suffolk rams and Charolais cattle, as well as keeping commercial livestock like ours. His wife, Anne, is a very popular and successful registered childminder, and all her tiny charges from farms are currently barred from attending, so now the industry's much-needed diversification enterprises are also being affected. There could be an outbreak of cabin-fever soon among folk stuck on their farms. Today (Tuesday) is traditionally market day in Hexham and there will be withdrawal symptoms felt all around the area as the auction marts fulfil a social need just as much as a vital economic one, and I am sure the town's shops will feel the pinch . Final update as the electricity flickers alarmingly. Peter has come in for a quick cuppa. We are about to gather in the sheep that should have been sold on Friday.

      "bodyText": "The majority of London's blue chip firms will not be eligible for inclusion in a series of ethically correct stock market indices that are being developed by FTSE, the index compiler. Speaking at the launch of the FTSE4Good index series, Mark Makepeace, chief executive of FTSE, predicted that more than half of the companies listed on the London Stock Exchange would fail to achieve the status of a socially responsible company when the list of eligible candidates is drawn up later this year. FTSE is developing the indices, which will allow investors to identify and track the progress of socially responsible companies, in response to demand from City institutions which are coming under increasing pressure to make ethical investments. Last year legislation was introduced requiring pension fund trustees to disclose publicly the extent to which ethical considerations were taken into account when making an investment decision. Mr Makepeace said he hoped the introduction of the indices would encourage companies to clean up their acts. \"What we are trying to do is to encourage companies to act in this way. We think a lot of pressure will be brought on companies to do just that.\" The indices will cover Britain, Europe, north America and the developed world as a whole. They are being developed in conjunction with Ethical Investment Research Service and a committee chaired by Mervyn Pedelty, boss of the Co-operative Bank, which will responsible for the definition of a socially responsible company. The UK and European indices will be introduced in June with the US and global versions appearing later this year. Mr Makepeace said he could not reveal which firms would be disbarred but admitted that tobacco firms and arms exporters were likely to be excluded.",

      "bodyText": "When migrants from Madura gathered in the village of Parenggean in Indonesian Borneo at 7pm on Sunday night they were told that they would be evacuated to the refugee camp in Sampit, 65 miles south. Salima, aged four, was left behind. She never saw her family again. Instead of being taken to safety, 118 of the 392 Madurese who were hoping to escape ethnic cleansing by the indigenous Dayaks were taken a quarter of a mile down the road to a school playing field. There they were forced off the trucks and hacked to death. \"It was crazy, it was so sadistic,\" said Hairul Saleh, who watched in horror from his front porch 20 metres away. \"They had no idea what was happening to them. They clearly thought they were being taken to Sampit.\" Mr Saleh's friend Marjo, who watched the carnage with him, added: \"As they got down from the trucks, they were killed straight away ...

Mr Marjo and Mr Saleh said first one truck arrived on the pitch and the passengers were forced out and killed. It drove away and a few minutes later a second truck arrived, and the Dayak executioners went through the same brutal routine. A third truck arrived and the same slaughter followed. Just as the first occupants of the fourth truck were being murdered, about 45 minutes after the first killing took place, something akin to divine inspiration occurred, said Rukmana Priyatna, the subdistrict chief. \"Someone screamed out: 'Special forces troops are coming.' The executioners ran off, which gave the [Madurese] the opportunity to run as well.\" For some reason the Dayak murderers, who came from a neighbouring area, regrouped but decided that they had sated their bloodlust, and so spared the Madurese still waiting in the village. The 60Dayaks, who were led by a man called Ibur and a government-appointed neighbourhood chief, calmly returned to their trucks, climbed back in and drove off. Mr Priyatna returned almost immedi ately to the killing field. \"The first thing that struck me when I reached the football field was the murder of the babies, the old people and the women,\" he said. \"They were all still there. They were all piled up together. About six of them had been beheaded.\" The massacre in Parenggean is the worst single slaughter in 10 days of ethnic cleansing of Madurese migrants by the indigenous Dayaks. The official death toll is put at 428; unofficially it is several times that number. The police say that decades of Dayak grievances against Madurese economic success came to a head with two disgruntled Dayaks paying a gang to attack a Madurese houses Sampit. Five of the Madurese died. The Madurese retaliated, killing 15 Dayaks, and that was swiftly followed by the tidal wave of murder. It shows few signs of abating, despite Jakarta sending several thousand troops and police officers. Since Sunday's massacre Mr Priyatna has had time to reflect on the events of a day which began well from the point of view of saving migrant lives in his district. Fifty-two Madurese had died since the ethnic cleansing spread to Parenggean on Wednesday, four days after it began in Sampit. To to prevent more deaths in his sub district, Mr Priyatna called a meeting of local Dayak community leaders for 8am on Sunday. \"The attitude of the Dayak community groups was that any remaining Madurese should be murdered, whereas my attitude was that they should not live here but that they should be allowed to stay alive,\" he said. The compromise reached after two hours of debate was to give the government and security forces five days to evacuate the 500 or so Madurese thought to be hiding in the jungle. Officials relayed the news to the Madurese over mosque loudspeakers. \"The announcement encouraged all those refugees in the forest to come out and that the local community would help them and give them food,\" Mr Priyatna said. Within four hours 392 people had come out of hiding and been picked up and taken to Parenggean. Mr Priyatna's well-laid plans turned to tragedy when Mr Ibur and 30 men armed with machetes, spears and a few homemade shotguns arrived from a neighbouring district, Kuala Kuayan. \"They said they came, according to the head of the group, because they were invited to 'strengthen this area', \" Mr Priyatna said, adding that he tried in vain to make them go away in peace.

Only \"the more shameless crooks\" would become MPs if it continued, he warned. \"At least half\" of all complaints made to the standards and privileges committee since 1997 had been petty or malicious, Mr Clarke said.

The former minister singled out in the \"absurd\" category complaints about William Hague's free use of a private gym; John Prescott's use of a subsidised flat and the fees for John Major's and Ken Livingstone's lucrative speaking engagements. He also strongly defended the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, from accusations of advocating policies to benefit his paid consultancy with a US oil company. He said no MP or journalist believed that his consultancy with oil company Kerr McGee, \"which did not own a single petrol station\" benefited from Tory policies advocating cuts in petrol prices. The committee is examining tighter rules forcing MPs to declare fees and contracts for outside speaking engagements and insisting that employment contracts are deposited in parliament revealing exactly how much money they receive. Mr Clarke, who opposes this, told the committee: \"MPs are entitled to the same level of privacy that other citizens are entitled to expect in their activities outside parliament.\" He added: \"We do appear to be racing towards the American position, whereby individual tax returns and health records are made freely available to the public.\" Later Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney general in Mr Major's government, called for one aspect of the rules to be tightened up - a proposal to exempt declarations of hospitality from regional quangos and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland governments.",

It would be like having a new Elgin Marbles. </p> <p>Sarah has also had to put up with the, by now, predictable, debate about her class origins, with some newspapers (on the left) claiming she's favoured as a long term prospect because she's \"posh\".

      "bodyText": "Poor Sarah Montague, Today's presenter, has had to contend with being touted as \"the new Sue MacGregor\". This is a bit puzzling for all of us on the programme, considering that a) we already have a Sue Macgregor in perfect working order and b) how could you possibly have a new one? It would be like having a new Elgin Marbles. Sarah has also had to put up with the, by now, predictable, debate about her class origins, with some newspapers (on the left) claiming she's favoured as a long term prospect because she's \"posh\". Which is puzzling again, because a few weeks ago some newspapers (on the right) were suggesting that Edward Stourton was to LEAVE because he was posh. I'm not sure about Sarah's class status. Maybe we should do what the Workers' Revolutionary Party did to suspect members in the 70s: tie her to a chair and beat her up until she confesses, tearfully, to a privileged upbringing. To tell the truth, as far as we're concerned, Sarah's been a mite disappointing so far. Oh, she's been a brilliant presenter - sharp, clever, warm and extremely professional. But she's singularly failed to tell any member of the Today team to fuck off, and we're beginning to lose patience. A few months ago Sarah was in all the papers for telling a Breakfast News producer to fuck off, live on air.

When music starts shifting the tectonic plates of the heart, nine times out of 10 what is at work is harmony - which is why the music of Don Carlo Gesualdo, royal prince and multiple murderer, sings to us so clearly across four centuries. </p> <p>Harmony is the weapon that composers use to hit us where we live, and perhaps no one has ever exploited its power with greater cunning than the Prince of Venosa, whose madrigals and motets, representing the cutting edge of music in the early years of the 17th century, will be performed at the Barbican next month along with a new film by the American painter and performance artist Joe Coleman as part of the Only Connect festival, in an evening devoted to Outsider Art. </p> <p>\"If Gesualdo had been taken as seriously in his own time as he is now,\" the Czech composer Ernst Krenek said in the 1950s, \"music history would have taken a different course.\" Even today, listening to his music can be like cycling down a frozen path - a sudden patch of harmonic ice can whip the listener's wheels away. Composed before the modern scale became the norm, his pieces - written for five, six or seven voices - make extensive use of microtonality, turning an Easter hymn or the setting of a love poem into a wild ride, full of quarter-steps and sideslips. </p> <p>Yet Gesualdo earns his status as an outsider artist not by virtue of his harmonic inventiveness but through his earthly transgressions, which included supervising the murder of his wife, their baby and his wife's lover. The contrast between the calculated gruesomeness of that deed and the celestial beauty of his music probably explains his appeal to the likes of the film directors Hans Werner Herzog, whose 1995 film biography, Death for Five Voices, featured the London-based Gesualdo Consort, and Bernardo Bertolucci, whose next feature film, Heaven and Hell, tells the composer's story. </p> <p>When Alex Poots, the executive director of Only Connect, called Joe Coleman at his Brooklyn home to discuss the possibility of combining his paintings with music, Gesualdo was one of the names on his list. \"I could see that he was interested in people with a very dark side to them,\" Poots says, referring to the murderers and freaks who populate Coleman's obsessively detailed portraits and \"humanscapes\". \"I thought maybe this combination would bring out the darker side of Gesualdo's music, which a lot of people prefer to ignore.\" The artist's response could hardly have been more gratifying. \"I've been wanting to do that for 10 years,\" said Coleman, who turned out to have an extensive collection of recordings of the composer's music. </p> <p>As Krenek's words suggested, interest in Gesualdo is recent. His death in 1613 was followed by a silence lasting more than three centuries, until dedicated work by a small band of enthusiasts, among them Igor Stravinsky and the conductor Robert Craft, brought him back into the light. Craft supervised a series of recordings, while Stravinsky's deep involvement led him to write Monumentum pro Gesualdo, an orchestral recomposition of three madrigals, first performed in 1960 and later choreographed by Balanchine. Gesualdo's place in history is now assured, based on the 125 madrigals, two keyboard pieces and three books of sacred music that are all that survive of what may have been a much larger body of work. The Taverner Consort's fine recording of his Good Friday service, released last year, is the most recent evidence of Gesualdo's acceptance. </p> <p>Born probably in 1560, a descendant of a king of Sicily, he showed early talent as a singer and a lutenist, cutting his teeth as a composer by producing settings for the poems of Torquato Tasso, a member of his father's court. In 1586, needing to produce an heir, he married the attractive Maria d'Avalos, his cousin. He was her third husband - the first, it is said, had died of too much sex, while the second obtained a papal divorce. Four years after their marriage in Naples, he came back from a hunting trip to dis cover her in bed with a young duke and had the two lovers stabbed to death and their corpses mutilated - although there is evidence that he had known about the affair for some time and set the whole thing up to look like a crime of passion. Harbouring doubts about his son's paternity, he also had the child murdered. </p> <p>He fled to his castle in the countryside, but on his father's death in 1591 he succeeded to his title and returned to Naples. The following year he began a successful courtship of Leonora d'Este, a princess of Ferrara, and left Naples for her home town with a retinue including 300 pieces of baggage carried on 24 mules. </p> <p>Asthmatic, manic depressive, a snappy dresser, addicted to masochistic practices, devoting at least seven hours a day to his music, he may not have been the easiest of partners. As the years passed Leonora grew unhappy with his waywardness, and a divorce petition was awaiting the pope's attention at the time of Gesualdo's death in 1613. </p> <p>As Robert Craft wrote, Gesualdo \"outstrips all contemporaries in his ability to choose correctly the intensifying step in a harmonic progression, and the next step, and the next\". But there was more to it than mere logic. Audacity was the identifying characteristic of his music, and it may have been rooted, as the musicologist Eric Van Tassel suggests, in the knowledge that he had no patron to satisfy, and could write to please only himself. That sense of freedom, of impulsiveness within a context of restraint, is what speaks to us today. </p> <p>\u0095 Outsider Art/Music, part of the Only Connect series and including work by Joe Coleman and Gesualdo, is at the Barbican, London EC2 (020-7638 8891), on March 22</p>",

      "body": "<p>Never mind the bollocks, let's talk about the here and now. Jamie Reid, whose record designs for the Sex Pistols gave punk some of its most enduring images, doesn't put it quite as bluntly as that, but that's the message. </p> <p>In his Toxteth flat, surrounded by the sunny, slightly New Agey work he now produces, he is willing to talk about those days of youthful rebellion but would rather discuss the exhibition of his work that opens in Glasgow this week - or even his plans to break into the hospitality industry. He doesn't want to be defined by his most striking image, the reworking of Cecil Beaton's portrait of Elizabeth II for the single God Save the Queen, which put a safety pin through the sovereign's lip in her silver jubilee year. </p> <p>\"My ambition now,\" he says, fiddling with his hair, \"is a kind of hotel. Surrounded by a good half a mile of land on all sides, it would have a landscape based on the four elements, a recording studio, film-making facilities and a really good restaurant. I'd love to do it in Liverpool. But wher ever you do it, you hit all kinds of problems with planning consent.\" </p> <p>It's hard to imagine Reid in the dry-as-dust world of planning consent forms and local government meetings. Even before his work with the Pistols, whose manager Malcolm McLaren was a fellow student at Croydon Art School in the late 1960s, Reid had founded Suburban Press, an anarchistic publishing house. </p> <p>In the decades since punk he has worked with musicians and campaigners from the radical left in their battles against nuclear weapons, racism, the poll tax and the criminal justice bill, clause 28, the criminalisation of cannabis and global capitalism. He spent the 1990s designing and painting the interior of the Strongroom recording studios in east London, and is currently working on his third CD cover for the Afro-Celt Sound System. </p> <p>During the last decade he also split from his partner of 17 years, actress Margi Clarke. With his wife Maria he is currently working on an animated film based on their frequent jaunts to the countryside in Wales, Scotland and Ireland. At the height of the Cool Britannia hype, Reid sold limited-edition prints of his punk designs to Kate Moss, Noel Gallagher and Madonna. </p> <p>Reid is keen to play down the radicalism of punk, seeing it simply as part of a long struggle for social justice. \"Punk was part of a story that had been going on for the whole of the century, if not longer - it was no more than an important bit of that story in Britain. I came to it through community-based anarchism and situationist theories, and they came out of surrealism and dadaism. And punk continues - at the anti-poll tax demonstrations in Trafalgar Square, 10,000 people were wearing T-shirts with the same ransom-note lettering as Never Mind the Bollocks but saying 'Bollocks to the Poll Tax.'\" </p> <p>Reid's more recent artwork is not quite so heavy on the expletives. While the new exhibition includes a mini-retrospective of his artwork for the Pistols, it consists mainly of the distinctly unthreatening and trippy Celtic-tinged wall hangings and large paintings that he now concentrates on. At first glance they look, well, hippyish and it's hard to reconcile them with the savage experimentalism of the 1970s. </p> <p>\"There have always been two sides to my work - the esoteric and the political. I think it has to do with being brought up in a family that was both deeply socialist and very druidic. I'm a druid and I've always believed that, much as you need political change, you also need spiritual change.\" </p> <p>Cynics may see in his astrologically influenced, shamanistic designs simply another angry young man who has turned artistically soft. But Reid's family background was a combination of both activism and privilege. He embraced the one and rejected the other. His grandfather, George Watson MacGregor Reid, was head of the Druid Order and stood for parliament just before the first world war. Though his father was City editor of the Daily Sketch, Jamie Reid's childhood couldn't have been further from a training in the sharp practices of the business world. </p> <p>Growing up in Shirley, near Croydon, with all the promise of postwar suburbia around him, Reid's early years were nonetheless highly politicised, with his parents \"dragging\" him off to CND demos and anti-apartheid marches. They sent him to the local grammar school where he flourished only at sport. \"I wanted to become a footballer, but was way too dissipated by 16,\" he cackles between puffs on ever-present cigarettes. </p> <p>\"I blew all my exams too. My choices then show how much things have changed. I could just walk into the local technical college without any qualifications and receive a grant to study art. Now you'd have to have three A-levels and you'd be in debt before you started. Education has become so elitist - that's why we've got such a vibrant underground of people educating themselves.\" </p> <p>It is his passion for this underground which indicates that Reid has retained more of the punk ethos than many of his peers. He prefers festivals and clubs to precious galleries, is more at home with collaborative, \"organic\" ways of working rather than commissions, and he has a deep concern for the harm global capitalism is doing. This leads to some very unpunky statements (\"I spend a lot of time down at the allotment\") and helpings of New Age mysticism (he calls the earth Gaia and refers to David Icke as a serious source of information). But the way he lives his life now remains close to the spirit of 1977. </p> <p>\"Punk was never about big master plans and it was always much more collective than Malcolm McLaren and John Lydon would ever admit. It was about finding yourself in a situation, reacting and then moving on, and that's what I do now.\" </p> <p>As he says this, the brilliant wintry sunshine that has been flooding into the flat is suddenly replaced by huge hailstones falling from a black sky. Reid smiles, calls Maria in. \"Look at that - it's Gaia saying she's had enough. She's fighting back against the damage we've done to the planet.\" Just heavy weather to the rest of us, but a moment of thrilling counter-cultural resistance to Jamie Reid. </p> <p>Peace is Tough by Jamie Reid is at the Arches, Glasgow, from Friday until March 18 as part of this year's FuncT festival. Reid will give a talk about his work this Saturday afternoon. Festival hotline: 0901 022 0300.</p>",

      "body": "<p>If you were very ill, would you want to be asked about how the health or social care services you receive could be improved? Or, as doctors often advise, are you likely to take things \"one day at a time\"? </p> <p>Research released today by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation shows there's enormous confusion whether those with serious and often life-threatening conditions should be asked to participate in the planning and delivery of their own care, or of the care generally available for people with their condition. For while government departments, local authorities and care agencies make much of \"user involvement\", it is often assumed that seriously ill people either shouldn't be asked, or are incapable, of exercising this option. </p> <p>Penny Rhodes, co-author of today's report, points out that misconceptions often arise because, in the past, agencies may have asked people with terminal or serious conditions to serve on user panels, but often they didn't turn up. This could be because at the time they were not well enough to take part, or simply because not enough thought was given to providing reliable transport to and from meetings. </p> <p>However, it is true that some service users may feel unable to overcome emotional or conceptional barriers to involvement. For instance, the sheer uncertainty of how they will feel day to day and week to week makes it impossible to think about their own future, never mind that of others. People may also be living with the stress of alternating hope and disappointment; others may have learnt to cope with the experience by living from day to day. </p> <p>Even so, says Rhodes, health and other support agencies should not assume that barriers like these preclude user involvement. First, agencies need to understand how these practical, emotional and psychological factors frame the experience of sufferers and their carers. Second, agencies have to acknowledge that they may make many demands on a person's time and emotional energy. Third, agencies must be imaginative in how they ask sufferers to become involved in service planning and delivery, and in how they intend to make user involvement an accessible and realistic process. </p> <p>The research focused on service users with multiple sclerosis, cystic fibrosis and motor neurone disease. It also highlights the ways in which people can become socially invisible and excluded, making user involvement even more unlikely. This may be due to an understandable reaction on the part of parents of a seriously ill child, for example. Their focus will inevitably rest on the child's condition and care, and on the emotional impacts this has on the family. </p> <p>But there is also the uncomfortable fact that provision of health, palliative and support services, and the consequent attention paid to user involvement, is uneven, depending to a large extent on the numbers of patients with particular conditions. Rhodes stresses that while comparisons are invidious, conditions such as cancers appear to have attracted more attention than cystic fibrosis, for instance, or a host of other serious illnesses affecting small numbers, but which together involve a considerable number of service users and their families. </p> <p>Perhaps the main exception to this is the very active campaign by those living with HIV/Aids, though even here, as one service user said at a recent conference: \"It's been difficult to persuade clinicians that we play a meaningful part in the determination of our lives. Somehow we've got to be asked and we've got to be listened to.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, we have probably moved on from the time when clinicians and other professionals viewed user involvement as an idealistic but impractical idea. Ann Crossley, regional chairperson of the Multiple Sclerosis Society, points out that professionals are more aware than ever of the importance of issues such as the management of severe pain, and how to give newly-diagnosed sufferers the right information in the right way. These developments might not have occurred without user involvement, she says. </p> <p>It is being increasingly recognised that real user involvement not only assists service providers and commissioners, but can mark a profound change in the way patients or clients view themselves, and are viewed by professionals. Tricia Holmes, director of care development at the Motor Neurone Disease Association, says: \"People living with MND have no control over the manner in which the disease progresses, and its impact. So it is important that they have control over how they live and the quality of their life.\" </p> <p>Another proponent of user involvement, Jean Pounceby, head of the Cystic Fibrosis Advocacy Service (CFAS), endorses the benefits to patients and services. \"People with chronic illnesses are the experts on their own condition, its clinical and treatment implications and the repercussions of these for their personal and social lives,\" she says. </p> <p>The CFAS, which employs paid advocates, all of whom have cystic fibrosis, is now about to operate on a national scale with senior NHS officers on the planning and commissioning of health services for those with the illness. She sees this as one model which the NHS, and other agencies, should investigate if they're serious about user involvement of people with serious illnesses. </p> <p>Other ways of making user involvement real, rather than token, are being developed. Peter Beresford, a veteran campaigner and professor of Brunel University's social policy centre for citizen participation, cites a recent event at which the majority of participants had life-threatening conditions. </p> <p>This, he says, aimed to show that people normally excluded from conventional user involvement forums were, with the right support, able to attend and contribute. Their contributions also made it clear that some relatively simple procedures could ensure that socially excluded patients could have an effective voice. </p> <p> So pressure is mounting to stop professionals and clinicians making unfounded assumptions about who wants to be, and who can be, involved in planning service delivery on either an individual or a wider basis. The government's NHS plan envisages the creation of a patient and advocacy liaison service. However, the jury is still out on whether this will address the fact that different individuals and service settings may require different approaches to user involvement. Also, it is not yet known whether the National Care Standards Commission will be able to bring socially excluded patients into the process of developing minimum care standards. </p> <p>But as Beresford points out: \"We've found that people with a terminal illness sometimes want to contribute to changes that will be in place after they're no longer here.

Fare, as it's known, was offered a hardship fund by the Charities Advisory Trust to provide a financial lifeline. I'm a member of the Fare committee, and we thought hard about accepting the offer of \u00a36,000. In less than two years, we have helped 52 families with grants from \u00a35 to \u00a3400. </p> <p>The grants fall into three groups: 27 for emergencies - that lone mother faced four days without a penny until the hardship fund saw her through; 14 for unanticipated events, such as the shortfall in funeral costs; nine for basic domestic items, among them a washing machine for a mother of three, whose husband had committed suicide. </p> <p>About 47 families we helped were dependent on income support or jobseeker's allowance; another three were on low wages. Almost three-quarters (36) received social fund loans from the benefits agency. Three had had applications rejected. Social fund loans are provided interest-free for essential items such as electric fires and furniture, but they entail automatic repayments averaging \u00a39-10 per week. I met lone parents who, after deductions, had a weekly cash income of less than \u00a37. The minimum income support rate, set by the government, is \u00a384.35. </p> <p>Unable to cope on their low and reduced incomes, more than half the families had taken out loans with companies charging up to 150% interest, or they had brought goods from shops which cater specially for \"the poor\". One firm swiftly delivers - with no deposit required - a cooker, washing machine and television. But an item priced at \u00a3739 eventually costs \u00a31,636, with an APR of 29%, plus service charges. </p> <p>Typical of our cases at Fare was a lone mother with a weekly income of \u00a3113.88. Her expenditure, including debt repayments of \u00a328, came to \u00a3113.25. When she bought Christmas presents, she fell behind with repayments, and her bed and cooker were about to be repossessed. </p> <p>These people are not wasteful. They are just living in poverty. As the family budget unit of London University has demonstrated, income support levels are far below a tolerable living standard. Families are pushed into debt, and the burden of repayments force them to scrimp on food, and cut out leisure activities. </p> <p>Poverty can be eliminated only by government. A local hardship fund only occasionally has a lasting effect - such as when a long-term unemployed drug-user sought our help.

Generally, however, the grants provide only temporary respite. </p> <p>Yet Fare believes it brings certain advantages to the administration of a hardship fund. In contrast with the delays over applications to statutory bodies, our help is immediate - for instance, preventing the drug-user from turning to crime. </p> <p>As Fare's participants are familiar with life at the hard end, those in need can turn to us as understanding friends, not distant officials.

      "body": "<p>It is eight years since Stanley, now 30 and a former drug addict, began a life sentence for murdering one of his prostitute girlfriend's clients in a cocaine-induced frenzy. Last month, not long after being moved in with other lifers at the high security Belmarsh prison in south London, he opened the main artery in his arm and was clinically dead before being resuscitated. </p> <p>Since the suicide attempt, Stanley has been an inpatient in the prison's mental health facility, which includes a day care unit. Run jointly by the prison service and the NHS, it has won the government's \"beacon\" status for its work on mental health - the only project of its kind to do so. </p> <p>Stanley, who says he was sexually abused as a child, is a difficult, disruptive prisoner. But now he visits the day care unit frequently and is feeling better than he has in years. </p> <p>As well as self-harm and suicide attempts, Belmarsh has to be constantly alert to the risks of escape, rioting and violence. Half of all its inmates have been under the care of a psychiatrist, and up to 10% are severely disturbed. Belmarsh's mental health unit was set up after four inmates took their lives over a period of seven months in 1997. </p> <p>In January 1999, the Oxleas NHS trust went into partnership with Belmarsh, and the mental health unit - named \"Cass\" after a deceased member of staff - was born. It services 1,000 inmates per year, half of them inpatients and half off the wing. </p> <p>The year of Cass's birth saw just one suicide in Belmarsh, and only one more last year. The prison has been given \u00a315,000 to spread the secret of its success to other prisons. </p> <p>Fiona Lydon, head of clinical services, says: \"We are there to help inmates who aren't coping, who may be self-harming or severely depressed. A lot of them should be in hospital, but they have personality disorders rather than mental illness, so we're stuck with them.\" Belmarsh's mental health service transfers just 70 inmates a year to secure hospitals. </p> <p>Lydon continues: \"After severe criticism from the chief inspector of prisons for the high number of deaths in custody, the governor did away with the old medical model and advertised for a head of healthcare, looking at service delivery in the community as a model. Being NHS led means inmates are more trusting of us, more likely to use the service.\" </p> <p>Ian Cummings, an NHS psychiatrist and one of the unit's 11 staff, spends three-and-a-half days a week at the prison. He says: \"We have lots of high-profile inmates here, on murder and sexual offences. Many are acutely mentally ill, with no structure to what they do in prison. We offer simple things to start with - table tennis, a relaxing atmosphere, comfy chairs - to encourage inmates to know the unit. If they're interested we can offer more, such as occupational therapy, art, music, yoga, counselling, mood management groups. We have a duty of care to the individuals beyond what they have done. </p> <p>\"Outside, there are lots of ways of dealing with depression. Maybe you'll talk to a friend, have a drink, or go to the gym to relax. Here, they don't have those means,\" Cummings says. </p> <p>\"A lot of these inmates have been victims themselves, and we are dealing with one of society's most disadvantaged groups. We have a chance to make a real impact.\" </p> <p>Senior prison officer Jan Czajkowski is a former Yorkshire miner who, with occupational therapist Tania Nicholls, runs the Cass unit. His job is to persuade inmates to come to the unit. Czajkowski, who moved from the landing because he \"didn't want to be a 'hard-nosed screw' for 20 years\", says: \"It was hard at first because the rest of the prison think if you're in the 'fluffy bunny' club you can't be secure. The cynics say we're a coffee shop for psychopaths. But what we are is an oasis in the prison desert. The work we do in our unit is like an oil tanker - tip it a bit and it could go out of control. We try to divert our inmates away from disaster.\" </p> <p>Paul Branks, clinical manager of the unit, adds: \"We are dealing with everyone from clever, astute men to the behaviourally sub-normal. Some need crisis intervention, others just need to be observed and assessed. We have to be good communicators.\" </p> <p>Self-harm gets much worse than lacerated arms in Belmarsh. Billy, a young inmate with a string of minor offences who is described as a \"poor coper\", developed a habit of opening up a wound in his stomach and filling it with cutlery, food and excrement, which gave him septicemia. </p> <p>Prison officer Maggie Shiret says he has \"not cut up for ages\" after the unit turned him around. \"Billy just needed someone to offload to, but he won't have that when he goes home.

      "bodyText": "It is eight years since Stanley, now 30 and a former drug addict, began a life sentence for murdering one of his prostitute girlfriend's clients in a cocaine-induced frenzy. Last month, not long after being moved in with other lifers at the high security Belmarsh prison in south London, he opened the main artery in his arm and was clinically dead before being resuscitated. Since the suicide attempt, Stanley has been an inpatient in the prison's mental health facility, which includes a day care unit. Run jointly by the prison service and the NHS, it has won the government's \"beacon\" status for its work on mental health - the only project of its kind to do so. Stanley, who says he was sexually abused as a child, is a difficult, disruptive prisoner. But now he visits the day care unit frequently and is feeling better than he has in years. As well as self-harm and suicide attempts, Belmarsh has to be constantly alert to the risks of escape, rioting and violence. Half of all its inmates have been under the care of a psychiatrist, and up to 10% are severely disturbed. Belmarsh's mental health unit was set up after four inmates took their lives over a period of seven months in 1997.

      "body": "<p>The reappearance of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in Britain has dealt a further blow to the fortunes of British farmers. And in its efforts to stamp out the disease, the Ministry of Agriculture is applying measures that have changed little in more than 100 years: all infected pigs and their contacts upon the premises must be slaughtered. </p> <p>The current outbreak has revived the memories of those who lived through the 1967-68 outbreak - the most devastating in British history. Yet that was merely the latest in a long history of devastation wreaked by this disease, which was rarely absent from its first recorded appearance in Britain in 1839 until the 1970s. The rapid spread of FMD by frequently unidentifiable means and the far-reaching consequences of the government's chosen control policy meant that for years - until supplanted by BSE - FMD was widely regarded as the most dangerous animal plague known. </p> <p>But FMD is not a killer disease. Most strains cause only sporadic deaths among young or sick animals; the vast majority suffer only lameness and loss of appetite, recovering in two or three weeks. Nor does FMD have many human health implications. Transfer to humans is rare and symptoms are mild. Because of this, the slaughter policy in the past has stimulated widespread opposition. </p> <p>The government's justification for slaughter is older than the policy itself. It is based solely on the fact that recovered animals show a decline in meat and milk productivity. Given its extreme contagiousness, officials say that if the disease is permitted to spread freely, the economic losses inflicted would outweigh the costs of eliminating FMD. </p> <p>In addition, the occurrence of even a single case of FMD leads many disease-free nations to place an immediate ban upon our valuable export trade. Disease freedom is therefore a precondition of international trade, and this could not be obtained through disease treatment or vaccination. </p> <p>The agriculture ministry therefore regards FMD primarily as an economic problem, not an animal welfare or public health issue. But while the productivity and export arguments may favour FMD elimination at the present time of intensive farming and open EU trade, they do not explain the origin of this policy or its continuation throughout most of the 20th century. </p> <p>It can be argued, indeed, that the slaughter policy has been self- reinforcing, giving rise to the very agricultural and economic conditions which justify its continuation. </p> <p>Large-scale state control of livestock disease dates from the 1860s, by which time FMD had been prevalent for more than 20 years. Slaughter, import regulation and movement restriction were introduced to control the killer cattle plague, a new contagious disease which devastated the national herd from 1865-67. </p> <p>Because of the success of such measures, there was a movement for the extension of controls to manage other prevailing contagious ailments, including FMD. Strong opposition to this was grounded in the widespread belief that FMD was an extremely mild and inconsequential disease, very unlike the cattle plague. </p> <p>But this was successfully countered by a group of wealthy, influential breeders, whose stock suffered a more severe form of disease, with corresponding economic losses. In this way, FMD became subject to legislative controls while many other prevalent diseases inflicting equivalent, or greater, economic damage were ignored. </p> <p>It was, therefore, the economic interests of the influential few which informed the original decision for state control of FMD. However, once these far-reaching measures were widely experienced - and failed to control the disease - they came to be identified with the disease itself. FMD occurrence began to be viewed as an economic disaster, not because it affected the milk supply but because it involved stock destruction and the prevention of marketing. As such, prevention was vital and farmers started to support the state programme for FMD elimination. This meant that when slaughter was first introduced in the 1910s - nominally to deal with initial outbreaks, rather than a widespread epidemic - there was little farming opposition. </p> <p>By the time of the extensive outbreak of 1922-24, however, slaughter was applied in almost every case, resulting in more than 250,000 deaths. At this point, the ministry answered criticisms by stating that disease elimination was essential to preserve the export trade. Owing to a government policy prioritising the production and export of manufacturing, not agricultural goods, this trade largely consisted of valuable pedigree stock, whose aristocratic owners undoubtedly influenced and supported the ministry's action. </p> <p>It was not until after the second world war that the export trade expanded. By this time, a new emphasis on agricultural productivity which favoured intensive farming methods gave further justification to strict FMD controls. The fact that many nations are now disease free and impose export bans upon other infected countries is in itself a direct result of British action. </p> <p>Partly, this occurred in the tit-for-tat attitude that seems to inform international BSE prevention. But also, in forming the European Commission on FMD in 1954, Britain successfully encouraged other countries to adopt similar FMD controls. The existence of reciprocal export bans thereby reinforced the ministry's position on the need to eliminate the disease, rather than simply control it. </p> <p>Using arguments of productivity and the export trade, the ministry has repeatedly refused to contemplate alternative FMD controls. However, this reliance upon such primitive measures - which predate the germ theory - has drawn frequent criticism, as huge scientific advances in disease control developed during the late 19th and 20th century have seemingly passed FMD by. If it never intended to diversify FMD controls, why did the government pour millions of pounds into a FMD research institute, founded at Pirbright in 1924, with the express aim of making FMD less harmful to Britain? </p> <p>In 1952, FMD spread throughout Europe, where it was combated using newly developed vaccines. Maff refused to consider such a step, despite rampant disease in Britain. This caused press condemnation. How had scientists spent public money if it was not to expressly aid British agriculture? In fact, vaccine research and production did occur in Britain, but only as a result of the second world war, when the ministry feared that a limited meat supply could lead to the abandonment of slaughter. </p> <p>The threat of FMD as a biological weapon was also taken extremely seriously during the 1940s and 50s and ensured ongoing prioritisation of vaccine research. However, due to a culture of secrecy (the hangover of which gave rise to the recent BSE debacle), such work was never publicised for fear that farmers would clamour for vaccine if they knew it existed. During the 1960s, when most European nations had embarked upon extensive FMD vaccination programmes, the ministry again refused to apply such measures to control the devastation in Britain. </p> <p>This story of FMD explodes the myth that the biological features of a disease automatically inform its \"correct\" management. It also reveals the diversity of economic arguments used to support slaughter - not all of which are openly acknowledged to the public. In response to the present outbreak, the government, as in the past, will undoubtedly, explain FMD slaughter in terms of productivity and the export market, and in economic terms their arguments will probably be justified. </p> <p>But these reasons have effectively been \"created\" over time - in part, to provide additional justification for an always-questionable policy.

      "body": "<p>Helen Carroll doesn't sound or look like a pioneer. Her voice is soft and she stands at just 5ft 1in. But her appearance is deceptive: Carroll has strength and determination in abundance. </p> <p>Today, she collects the OBE awarded for her work as a midwife dealing specifically with homeless families in south Manchester. It's not a common job description - she knows of only one other person in the country doing anything similar. </p> <p>Carroll, 45, arrived at her specialism via community midwifery, where she noticed inequalities. \"Homeless families weren't accessing services properly,\" she says. \"It was all crisis management. No one knew they were there until something bad happened.\" </p> <p>She suggested it would be logical to have a homeless families midwife, but she was ahead of her time. \"It was the late 1980s and management didn't feel it was the right thing to do. It wasn't on the political agenda then. Public health wasn't such a buzz word.\" </p> <p>So Carroll got involved with a special interest group for homeless families and continued her work on an informal basis. It took until 1996 for her idea to be taken up officially. A new head of midwifery services agreed that a role should be developed for special needs, covering homeless families, teenage pregnancies and women with mental health problems. Carroll was given the job - and a very wide brief. </p> <p>\"Homeless families are my priority,\" she says, \"but I work with women with problems such as schizophrenia, with postnatal depression and with teenagers. I also give family planning advice. It's difficult to fit everything in, but you can't tell people you won't help because it's after official hours.\" </p> <p>There's a lot of liaison with different agencies (social services, health visitors, drug counsellors and housing departments) but Carroll says: \"I'm lucky because there's no stigma attached to midwives, so I'm generally looked at in a positive way by the women who need my help. I also make a real effort to be proactive. I find out if these women are booked into hospitals for their labour, if they're linked to other agencies, if they know how to help themselves. I give them support and antenatal and postnatal care, and keep some continuity going.\" </p> <p>The women she helps are not always the easiest to deal with, but Carroll says that's not surprising. \"It's important not to be judgmental and to have some empathy. I don't want these women to be painted as down-at-heel.\" </p> <p>She focuses mainly on three homeless family hostels and a supported accommodation unit for single young women. She has a caseload of 37, with most of the women aged between 17 and 30. </p> <p>The work can be draining. Carroll recalls a girl who committed suicide a few years after having her baby. She left a letter thanking her for her help, but Carroll still wishes she had done more for the girl. </p> <p>She is keen for midwifery to have the kind of city-wide team that exists for social workers and health visitors. Last year, 41% of the women Carroll looked after were fleeing domestic violence. Such women could be lost by the system, but Carroll is determined they won't be. \"In the last five years, domestic violence has become something of a political football, but it's important to remember the real people it affects. You have to help the women become survivors. They need emotional support and maternity care. I just have to adapt to the circumstances.\" That might mean changing the hospital they go to, because the boyfriend knows where it is, or giving antenatal care at the hostel. </p> <p>She too experienced aggressive behaviour. \"Once I had this frightened, pregnant woman, her five-year-old twins hanging on to my legs, and an irate man screaming at all of us,\" she says. \"The hostel had a panic button and the police soon came to take the man away, but it was a stressful experience.\" </p> <p>Carroll's expertise has involved her with other domestic violence committees and mental health forums. She is also looking at public health and the role of the midwife for the Department of Health. </p> <p>\"Ten years ago you wouldn't have found midwives sitting on these kind of committees. We're progressing but there's a lot more to do. I'm nervous about my OBE because it puts the spotlight on me, but it's good for midwifery and I'm hoping it will be good for the women I treat. Something has to be done about affordable, desirable housing.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Poet Michael Symmons Roberts returned to Greenham Common in 1998, to see the landscape of his childhood and adolescence being demolished in a way he could never have imagined. What he had imagined, back in the late 1970s and early 1980s, was not just demolition, but nuclear annihilation. A blinding flash. Fierce heat. The end of him, his family, his friends, the rest of Newbury, the rest of Berkshire and, for all he knew, most of southern England. </p> <p>All that would remain would be those huge concrete silos that housed American missiles on British soil. At least he was right about that. They were still there, covered in grass and ivy now, but impervious to assault by bulldozer or JCB. \"I saw them as soon as we had gone through this business park full of computer companies and security firms,\" he recalls. \"The road suddenly opened up and there was a vast wasteland, like a moonscape.\" </p> <p>What was once the longest runway in Europe had been broken up. Halfway along it was an abandoned Fiat Uno, its windscreen smashed by a chunk of concrete. \"The joyriders had scrawled 'F-off, Yanks' along the side,\" says Roberts, 37. \"They'd done what we had wanted to do at their age, which was to storm in and make a claim. But it was a pyrrhic victory.\" </p> <p>The Yanks had effed-off years ago. Even most of the women protesters who had occupied the famous Greenham Common peace camp for so long had departed. All that remained was a solitary caravan at the main gate and, inside, one or two nature wardens and the demolition workers. \"When I first saw what they were doing, I had an odd reaction,\" Robert goes on. \"I thought it a shame that something so familiar from my childhood was being swept away. Then I checked myself. What was I saying? I started to remember what it was really like to grow up here.\" </p> <p>He's about to tell the rest of us. His third book of poems, Burning Babylon - dedicated to Greenham Common - will be published later this year. But next week, Radio 4 will broadcast Roberts's first play, Brimstone, inspired by the same subject. The main characters are a demolition man and a female nature warden. Both are locals with other reasons for coming back. The warden had once \"crossed the line\" to join the peace women. \"It's a useful dramatic device, but I never knew anyone who did it in real life,\" says Roberts. </p> <p>Apart from being a poet, Roberts is a Manchester-based BBC television producer and no stranger to radio. Why has he chosen now to write his first play? \"Sometimes, when the subject matter is very close, you can't see it,\" he says. \"I'd been back to see my parents on many occasions, but only when the demolition started did I take notice of the air base again.\" </p> <p>The memories stirred up a long-hidden resentment \"against the society that produced something so lunatic on our doorstep,\" he explains. \"We were right in the nuclear triangle between Aldermaston, where they designed these weapons, Burghfield Royal Ordnance Factory, where they made them, and Greenham Common, where they were deployed. Everybody at my school was conscious of being in the firing line. </p> <p>\"I've begun to brood on why we should have had that blot on our childhood. My oldest boy, Joseph, is seven and imaginative, quite capable of being terrified by floods or monsters. Just imagine trying to tell him what it was like to have Greenham Common down the road.\" </p> <p>Roberts was the same age as Joseph is now when his parents moved from Preston to Newbury, where his father became sales manager at a local company. Life was reasonably peaceful and the local air base even staged open days. Not for much longer, though. He was 12 or 13 when he became conscious that more and more US Air Force F1-11s were darkening the skies over Berkshire. \"I remember one of them dropping white dust on our school playing fields. Because it looked like snow, we all picked it up. There was a rumour doing the rounds for days afterwards that the dust was radioactive.\" </p> <p>The rumour mill began turning ever faster in 1979, when the missiles arrived. Roberts lay awake at nights, sometimes chilled with fear. What was that siren? And that plane overhead? Was the big bang coming? </p> <p>Threads, Barry Hines's TV play about a nuclear strike on Sheffield, was screened on the BBC at the height of this phase of cold war tension. \"It scared the hell out of us,\" Roberts recalls. \"You could tell some kids were really nervous, but there was a lot of bravado among the boys. We'd compete to tell the most terrifying stories of what it would be like. A hot carving knife peeling off your flesh was one of the favourites.\" </p> <p>He was with friends in Newbury when he first saw some peace women. \"We knew who they were, but we were too awe-struck to go near them. They looked as though they'd come down from the mountains. Very exotic.\" Also exotic, in a different way, were the American airmen. \"They had their own mini-town on the edge of the base, with baseball pitches and a grocery store,\" Roberts says. \"You'd even see big Cadillacs cruising around. When we were old enough to drive, we'd go out there and gawp. At night we'd play motorised tag with the military police. We'd park somewhere on the perimeter fence and shine the headlights inside on full beam. After 10 minutes, they'd turn up, we'd move on and they'd follow. They never spoke. They just made it plain we were under observation.\" </p> <p>Did he ever feel as though he was living under an occupying power? \"There was something of that about it. Here was a place we couldn't go, but we knew it was threatening our future because we saw it regularly on the national news.\" </p> <p>At 19, he went to Oxford to study philosophy and theology, returning after three years to join the Newbury Weekly News. \"I was politically sympathetic to the peace women but put off by their manifest hostility to me as a man and as a representative of the press. They would only be interviewed by female reporters. And when I covered their cases before the local magistrates, they were always bristling with hostility towards the court system and the media. </p> <p>\"They were part of a movement whose intentions were entirely laudable at the beginning. But the peace movement got hijacked by another agenda - a sort of feminist-separatist policy which made them even more distanced from the local community.\" </p> <p>Did the women have any influence on the process that saw US airmen ultimately replaced by demolition men?\"It was more to do with economic changes in the former Soviet Union than anything happening in Newbury or, indeed, Whitehall,\" Roberts says. \"This was world-stage politics played out on somebody's doorstep. It just happened to be ours.\" </p> <p><strong>The big band or just a rehearsal?</strong></p> <p>Sirens in the small hours: <br></p> <p>in come the Cadillacs and Chryslers, <br></p> <p>the families who live outside. <br></p> <p>Yellow, to red, to black alert; <br></p> <p>troops in masks and radiation suits usher cars through Main Gate. <br></p> <p>Yellow Gate women stagger <br></p> <p>from their tents and squat in the road to scupper this night exercise, <br></p> <p>but only the Colonel knows for sure <br></p> <p>if this is a rehearsal, or the big bang. <br></p> <p>Either way, it must feel real. <br></p> <p> An extract from The Sacrifice, by Michael Symmons Roberts, from the book Burning Babylon </p> <p>Brimstone will be broadcast on Radio 4 at 2.15pm next Tuesday. Burning Babylon will be published, price \u00a38, by Jonathan Cape in August.</p>",

Here was a place we couldn't go, but we knew it was threatening our future because we saw it regularly on the national news.\" At 19, he went to Oxford to study philosophy and theology, returning after three years to join the Newbury Weekly News. \"I was politically sympathetic to the peace women but put off by their manifest hostility to me as a man and as a representative of the press. They would only be interviewed by female reporters. And when I covered their cases before the local magistrates, they were always bristling with hostility towards the court system and the media. \"They were part of a movement whose intentions were entirely laudable at the beginning. But the peace movement got hijacked by another agenda - a sort of feminist-separatist policy which made them even more distanced from the local community.\" Did the women have any influence on the process that saw US airmen ultimately replaced by demolition men?\"It was more to do with economic changes in the former Soviet Union than anything happening in Newbury or, indeed, Whitehall,\" Roberts says. \"This was world-stage politics played out on somebody's doorstep. It just happened to be ours.\" The big band or just a rehearsal? Sirens in the small hours: in come the Cadillacs and Chryslers, the families who live outside. Yellow, to red, to black alert; troops in masks and radiation suits usher cars through Main Gate. Yellow Gate women stagger from their tents and squat in the road to scupper this night exercise, but only the Colonel knows for sure if this is a rehearsal, or the big bang. Either way, it must feel real. An extract from The Sacrifice, by Michael Symmons Roberts, from the book Burning Babylon Brimstone will be broadcast on Radio 4 at 2.15pm next Tuesday.

She has since taken part in a pioneering project that has turned her life around from an addict who would stop at nothing to get a fix into a 28-year-old with a job - and self-respect. </p> <p>West Cornwall, with its picture postcard image, is an unlikely setting for a revolution in criminal justice. But this is what has happened in an area that has become known as the county's \"heroin capital\". It has been prompted in part by the recognition that rising drug abuse and the associated rise in crime has overwhelmed the existing system. </p> <p>It is almost three years since the drug assessment and stabilisation programme (Dasp) was introduced in the Cornish council wards of Penwith and Kerrier as an alternative to other sentences, including prison. </p> <p>The scheme, targeted at persistent offenders who use drugs intravenously, is based on rehabilitation. Instead of custodial sentences, offend ers are given probation orders with the condition that they participate fully in a detoxification programme, admit to their offences and help in retrieving stolen property. Drug workers liaise constantly with police and probation officers to monitor any non-compliances. Any evidence of continued use of drugs or criminal activity is dealt with harshly, with the offender brought back to court. </p> <p>The success of the detoxification programme in dealing with the \"hardest cases\" has led to similar schemes rolling out across Britain with the introduction of drug treatment and testing orders. Under the orders, introduced last October, drug abusers with long criminal records agree to have their addiction treated, and, in return, courts can decide against jailing them or imposing large fines. Addicts are subjected to twice weekly urine tests and regular court reviews of their progress. Offenders who go back on to illegal street drugs are returned to court where they will face a traditional punishment. </p> <p>Keith Hellawell, the government's anti-drugs coordinator, hopes the orders will break the cycle of drugs and crime. Announcing introduction of the orders, home secretary Jack Straw cited Home Office research showing that six in 10 criminals take drugs. Also, it is claimed that a third of all property crimes such as burglary are drug related - with an annual cost to the country of \u00a32.5bn. </p> <p>The scheme is due to be rolled out across the UK in 2003. But in west Cornwall there has already been a dramatic reduction in crime following Dasp's launch in October 1997. </p> <p>Penwith, which stretches from the craggy cliffs of Land's End to the picturesque, bustling town of St Ives, has become a haven for heroin addicts. At least nine dealers are known by police to operate from Penzance. Amphetamines, rather than heroin, are the main drug in the neighbouring district of Kerrier. And both areas have a drug dependency problem comparable with some inner cities. The average hard drug problem costs \u00a3282 a week - more than \u00a314,500 a year. The scale of drug use is such that it is estimated that 70% of crime within Kerrier and Penwith is drug-related. </p> <p>Liaison at an early stage between the police and the probation service and community drugs team has been crucial. In just 12 months, house burglaries dropped by a third in Kerrier, and fell by 10% in Penwith, while non-domestic burglaries fell by a third in Penwith and 15% in Kerrier. </p> <p>Bob Crossland, Cornwall drug action team coordinator, says it proved vital to start the treatment process while the addict was on bail following an arrest. Detox treatment could be offered immediately - with the defendant taking substitute prescription drugs at a community pharmacy, and being given counselling. </p> <p>\"We are very lucky as we have no waiting lists to enter treatment,\" says Crossland. \"This minimises the pos sibility of any further offences being committed before a court order. Offering a place on the programme also motivates the offender to admit the offences as well as assist in the retrieval of stolen property. We can also see how motivated they are in keeping appointments with the community drugs team.\" </p> <p>Unlike Cornwall, other areas have long waiting lists for drug treatment programmes and are struggling to give offenders the help they need quickly. They are also shackled by a shortage of community drug workers - a situation which has angered probation workers. \"Recruitment problems should have been addressed before launching the scheme,\" says Harry Fletcher, of the National Association of Probation Officers. \"Offenders can not wait six months for treatment.\" </p> <p> The treatment on offer varies across the country. In Wakefield and Pontefract, West Yorkshire, complementary medicines have been offered alongside traditional detoxification programmes to offenders for the last three years. Addicts can receive a massage or auricular acupuncture to help treat their addiction, on top of conventional detoxification treatment. Small lapses are tolerated in the first few months, but any major lapses lead to a reappearance in a special drugs court and a possible prison sentence. </p> <p>For Teri, one of Dasp's biggest success stories, the prospect of spending six months in prison was enough to persuade her to undergo treatment. She had started experimenting with drugs when she was 15, but it was not until she lost her job, at the age of 24, that her problems began. She had a live-in job at a hotel, but found herself homeless when the hotel suddenly closed down. </p> <p>Teri says: \"I was found somewhere to live in Truro which was full of dealers. I couldn't get a job and couldn't go back to college. I had nothing to do, so I started taking speed. After three or four months of playing about with speed, I started injecting. It was costing \u00a3500 a day so I started stealing and began shoplifting to order. If it cost more than \u00a310 and wasn't nailed down I would take it.\" </p> <p>She was caught several times and ended up on remand at Eastwood Park prison, Gloucester. With nine previous convictions for shoplifting and two for credit card fraud, she faced a minimum six-month jail sentence. Terrified by the prospect, she agreed to take part in the Dasp scheme as part of a two-year probation order. One of the conditions was spending the first 12 months living in a bail hostel in Camborne. </p> <p>After five months on the programme, Teri was allowed to leave the hostel as she had been clear of street drugs and had committed no further crimes. Shortly afterwards, she was off drugs completely, her probation order was revoked and she was in her own flat. Two months ago, she started a new job as a waitress in a hotel.</p> <p><strong>Tough route to success</strong></p> <p>Thirty-four people in Cornwall have been placed on a Dasp order, including eight women. Others were referred to the community drugs team, but assessed as not suitable. Half have succeeded, or are continuing on the programme. </p> <p>All have experienced a reduc tion in the use of street drugs; 78% no longer use them at all. Women are more likely to succeed than men; three-quarters of women succeeded. </p> <p>Amphetamine users achieved better outcomes than heroin users, and those aged 25-32 were more likely to succeed.</p> <p>Special report on drugs and alcohol: <a href=\"http://www.SocietyGuardian.co.uk/drugsandalcohol\">www.SocietyGuardian.co.uk/drugsandalcohol</a> </p>",

In Wakefield and Pontefract, West Yorkshire, complementary medicines have been offered alongside traditional detoxification programmes to offenders for the last three years. Addicts can receive a massage or auricular acupuncture to help treat their addiction, on top of conventional detoxification treatment. Small lapses are tolerated in the first few months, but any major lapses lead to a reappearance in a special drugs court and a possible prison sentence. For Teri, one of Dasp's biggest success stories, the prospect of spending six months in prison was enough to persuade her to undergo treatment. She had started experimenting with drugs when she was 15, but it was not until she lost her job, at the age of 24, that her problems began. She had a live-in job at a hotel, but found herself homeless when the hotel suddenly closed down. Teri says: \"I was found somewhere to live in Truro which was full of dealers. I couldn't get a job and couldn't go back to college. I had nothing to do, so I started taking speed. After three or four months of playing about with speed, I started injecting. It was costing \u00a3500 a day so I started stealing and began shoplifting to order. If it cost more than \u00a310 and wasn't nailed down I would take it.\" She was caught several times and ended up on remand at Eastwood Park prison, Gloucester. With nine previous convictions for shoplifting and two for credit card fraud, she faced a minimum six-month jail sentence. Terrified by the prospect, she agreed to take part in the Dasp scheme as part of a two-year probation order. One of the conditions was spending the first 12 months living in a bail hostel in Camborne. After five months on the programme, Teri was allowed to leave the hostel as she had been clear of street drugs and had committed no further crimes. Shortly afterwards, she was off drugs completely, her probation order was revoked and she was in her own flat. Two months ago, she started a new job as a waitress in a hotel. Tough route to success Thirty-four people in Cornwall have been placed on a Dasp order, including eight women. Others were referred to the community drugs team, but assessed as not suitable. Half have succeeded, or are continuing on the programme. All have experienced a reduc tion in the use of street drugs; 78% no longer use them at all. Women are more likely to succeed than men; three-quarters of women succeeded. Amphetamine users achieved better outcomes than heroin users, and those aged 25-32 were more likely to succeed.

And William Hague believes that many high-rise council estates are still so unpopular that he has committed the Conservatives to tear down all remaining blighted blocks. </p> <p>But this block-bashing is balanced by new enthusiasm for homes in the sky. Housing minister Nick Raynsford today opens a unique scheme in Portsmouth: the conversion of a city centre office tower into 96 flats; a mix of housing association and private ownership. And in London, Peabody Trust, the housing charity, is breaking new ground with plans for three projects of up to 20 storeys. </p> <p>Jeff Welling, Portsmouth's housing services director, says that a shortage of land for housing in the city was the impetus for utilising an empty office building, renamed Chandos Rise. </p> <p>In London, intense demand for accommodation for key workers in inner boroughs , and for low-income tenants, plus the prohibitive cost of new sites, is steering Peabody to plan far taller buildings than it has previously constructed, says the trust's director of development, Dickon Robinson. </p> <p>Peabody has its eye on sites in Hackney, North Kensington and Southwark. If the schemes go ahead, Robinson believes that flats on the upper floors should have bigger rooms than those below, to attract occupants; and that maintenance must be of a guaranteed high standard. </p> <p>Horror stories - everything from design defects to drugs; from mould to muggings - began to plague high-rise living almost as soon as blocks were erected en masse in the system-built 60s. </p> <p>Catastrophes, such as the gas explosion that ripped through the corner flats of the 22-storey Ronan Point in east London in 1968, killing five people, fixed the image. Yet the reality is that most councils, while they might have pulled down some scarcely habitable blocks, still have a mix of well-run and run-down high-risers - 4,000 in all, providing homes for an estimated 800,000 people. </p> <p>While there has been a national campaign by disillusioned tenants to get rid of tower blocks, there's been no concerted effort to persuade professionals in the housing sector, and residents, of their merits - until now. </p> <p>The pressure group formed for this purpose hasn't picked a catchy name - the National Sustainable Tower Blocks Initiative (NSTBI) - but at least the four founding partners (Community Development Foundation, Going for Green, Groundwork and Shell Better Britain) have chosen a good moment for a campaign. In the next few years there is expected to be a huge transfer of blocks by councils to housing associations, many with no experience of the specific problems of multi-storey buildings. </p> <p>There is a lot of muddle about what to do with the tower block legacy. It is roughly 10 times more expensive to refurbish than to demolish them. Finance is more easily obtained for housing association new-build schemes than for renewing localauthority stock. </p> <p>No wonder there are conflicting views. Put problem families or refugees in otherwise unlettable high-rise blocks on a short-term basis, says one camp; patch up the blocks and make the best of a bad job, runs another argument. What is true is that some councils have reversed decisions to condemn blocks - and the result has been a spectacular success. This confusion has at least shown the need for a new discussion. </p> <p>Several of the NSTBI's founders are, or were, environmental campaigners, and it's the extension of their concerns from countryside to cities that is leading to a re-think about high-rise. Chris Church, initiative co-ordinator, stresses that they are not in favour of retaining all blocks, whatever the cost. Those that are structurally unsound, saturated with social problems, or located on badly planned estates, may be beyond any recovery programme. </p> <p>But Church, who started in Greenpeace in the 1970s, insists that revitalising the blocks must be done in a wider social, environmental and economic context. </p> <p>Socially, blocks often fail because they are used inappropriately, which means they are not suitable for families with young children. For a sense of community to flourish, they need residents who are happy to be there, not desperate to move out, and residents have to be given a democratic voice in running their estates. </p> <p>Economically, tower blocks in or near city centres can help improve urban life if some of the accommodation is reserved for employees who keep vital services running - transport, health and welfare. </p> <p>Environmentally, the initiative argues that tower blocks have the advantage of often leaving a smaller \"ecological footprint\" than conventional housing. They can be more energy-efficient, and sharing facilities and services - food co-ops, community cafes and growing vegetables - can reduce waste and save residents money. </p> <p>Church and his colleagues have held seminars and produced reports detailing the past perils of high-rise; and have defined the essentials for well-run blocks, as a sort of good practice guide. They argue that, as the government predicts 4.4m new households will be formed by 2016, tower blocks will be ideal for small family units. They point out that the government should realise how relevant they are to Labour policies on social inclusion, local democracy and active citizenship. </p> <p>The initiative makes a cogent, well-argued case. The partners have yet to bend a ministerial ear, and still have to persuade most local authorities to support their ideas. But at least they are beginning to spread the practical message that there are plenty of examples of successful tower block communities which can be copied. </p> <p>Salford, in Greater Manchester, shows how it can be done - on the Pendleton estate, whose 30 towers once made it the highest density estate in Europe. Area housing manager John Oakley says Salford council has always invested heavily in maintenance, kept vandalism to a minimum with CCTV, formed a residents' management committee, and added many communal facilities, including landscaped gardens. It has also marketed the estate's good reputation when advertising vacant flats. </p> <p>Star of the estate is the 16-storey Apple Tree Court. Betty Burton, a lynchpin of the community for 22 years, surveys her desirable domain from the cafe built - together with a grand conservatory - with almost \u00a3200,000 from the national lottery charities board. \"It's always been a good block,\" she says, listing the improvements that the tenants' association has implemented. The best testament is the list of 14 prospective tenants waiting to be interviewed for a vacant flat. </p> <p>There is, perhaps, a whiff of creating model communities in tower blocks in the minds of Chris Church and his colleagues. Some might sniff at it. It is easy to see why harassed housing managers and councillors, faced with \"slums in the sky\", see demolition as the solution to a well-meant bit of 1960s social policy gone sour. But projections show we may need high-rises for decades to come. </p> <p>Setting up a national network of tower block residents' groups is one of the initiative's ideas. Even simpler is its suggestion for a national tower blocks day, to mark the joys of living aloft. </p> <p><strong>The rise and fall and rise again...</strong></p> <p>About 6,500 multi-storey blocks went up in the UK from the early 1950s to the early 1990s. The boom period lasted 20 years from the early 1950s. About 4,000 tower blocks remain, mostly council-owned, and an estimated 800,000 people live in them. In London, the first high-rise was a 10-storey residential block in Holborn, in 1949.</p> <p><strong> Most notorious block:</strong> Ronan Point, Canning Town, east London. A corner of the 22-storey structure collapsed in 1968. Five people were killed. </p> <p><strong> Most lauded block:</strong> Trellick Tower, North Kensington, London. Designed in the 1960s by Erno Goldfinger; an architectural and housing management showplace. Almost all of its 200 residents prefer to rent rather than buy. </p> <p><strong> Worst decade for high rise:</strong> The 1970s, when the backlash against faulty structures and the concentration of social problems almost halted construction of tower blocks. </p> <p><strong> Best decades:</strong> The 1960s, when system-building led to forests of blocks; the late 1990s onwards, when luxury tower blocks became fashionable in the private sector, and the public sector realised the value of well-run high-rise buildings. </p> <p>Further information on the NSTBI at <a href=\"http://www.towerblocks.org.uk\">www.towerblocks.org.uk</a></p>",

Even simpler is its suggestion for a national tower blocks day, to mark the joys of living aloft. The rise and fall and rise again... About 6,500 multi-storey blocks went up in the UK from the early 1950s to the early 1990s. The boom period lasted 20 years from the early 1950s. About 4,000 tower blocks remain, mostly council-owned, and an estimated 800,000 people live in them. In London, the first high-rise was a 10-storey residential block in Holborn, in 1949. Most notorious block: Ronan Point, Canning Town, east London. A corner of the 22-storey structure collapsed in 1968. Five people were killed. Most lauded block: Trellick Tower, North Kensington, London. Designed in the 1960s by Erno Goldfinger; an architectural and housing management showplace. Almost all of its 200 residents prefer to rent rather than buy. Worst decade for high rise: The 1970s, when the backlash against faulty structures and the concentration of social problems almost halted construction of tower blocks. Best decades: The 1960s, when system-building led to forests of blocks; the late 1990s onwards, when luxury tower blocks became fashionable in the private sector, and the public sector realised the value of well-run high-rise buildings.

Telephones, personal organisers and video cassettes would all go towards funding her \u00a3350-a-week drugs habit. The cash was to pay for amphetamines, which she injected up to three times a day. </p> <p>That was two years ago. She has since taken part in a pioneering project that has turned her life around from an addict who would stop at nothing to get a fix into a 28-year-old with a job - and self-respect. </p> <p>West Cornwall, with its picture postcard image, is an unlikely setting for a revolution in criminal justice. But this is what has happened in an area that has become known as the county's \"heroin capital\". It has been prompted in part by the recognition that rising drug abuse and the associated rise in crime has overwhelmed the existing system. </p> <p>It is almost three years since the drug assessment and stabilisation programme (Dasp) was introduced in the Cornish council wards of Penwith and Kerrier as an alternative to other sentences, including prison. </p> <p>The scheme, targeted at persistent offenders who use drugs intravenously, is based on rehabilitation. Instead of custodial sentences, offend ers are given probation orders with the condition that they participate fully in a detoxification programme, admit to their offences and help in retrieving stolen property. Drug workers liaise constantly with police and probation officers to monitor any non-compliances. Any evidence of continued use of drugs or criminal activity is dealt with harshly, with the offender brought back to court. </p> <p>The success of the detoxification programme in dealing with the \"hardest cases\" has led to similar schemes rolling out across Britain with the introduction of drug treatment and testing orders. Under the orders, introduced last October, drug abusers with long criminal records agree to have their addiction treated, and, in return, courts can decide against jailing them or imposing large fines. Addicts are subjected to twice weekly urine tests and regular court reviews of their progress. Offenders who go back on to illegal street drugs are returned to court where they will face a traditional punishment. </p> <p>Keith Hellawell, the government's anti-drugs coordinator, hopes the orders will break the cycle of drugs and crime. Announcing introduction of the orders, home secretary Jack Straw cited Home Office research showing that six in 10 criminals take drugs. Also, it is claimed that a third of all property crimes such as burglary are drug related - with an annual cost to the country of \u00a32.5bn. </p> <p>The scheme is due to be rolled out across the UK in 2003. But in west Cornwall there has already been a dramatic reduction in crime following Dasp's launch in October 1997. </p> <p>Penwith, which stretches from the craggy cliffs of Land's End to the picturesque, bustling town of St Ives, has become a haven for heroin addicts. At least nine dealers are known by police to operate from Penzance. Amphetamines, rather than heroin, are the main drug in the neighbouring district of Kerrier. And both areas have a drug dependency problem comparable with some inner cities. The average hard drug problem costs \u00a3282 a week - more than \u00a314,500 a year. The scale of drug use is such that it is estimated that 70% of crime within Kerrier and Penwith is drug-related. </p> <p>Liaison at an early stage between the police and the probation service and community drugs team has been crucial. In just 12 months, house burglaries dropped by a third in Kerrier, and fell by 10% in Penwith, while non-domestic burglaries fell by a third in Penwith and 15% in Kerrier. </p> <p>Bob Crossland, Cornwall drug action team coordinator, says it proved vital to start the treatment process while the addict was on bail following an arrest. Detox treatment could be offered immediately - with the defendant taking substitute prescription drugs at a community pharmacy, and being given counselling. </p> <p>\"We are very lucky as we have no waiting lists to enter treatment,\" says Crossland. \"This minimises the pos sibility of any further offences being committed before a court order. Offering a place on the programme also motivates the offender to admit the offences as well as assist in the retrieval of stolen property. We can also see how motivated they are in keeping appointments with the community drugs team.\" </p> <p>Unlike Cornwall, other areas have long waiting lists for drug treatment programmes and are struggling to give offenders the help they need quickly. They are also shackled by a shortage of community drug workers - a situation which has angered probation workers. \"Recruitment problems should have been addressed before launching the scheme,\" says Harry Fletcher, of the National Association of Probation Officers. \"Offenders can not wait six months for treatment.\" </p> <p> The treatment on offer varies across the country. In Wakefield and Pontefract, West Yorkshire, complementary medicines have been offered alongside traditional detoxification programmes to offenders for the last three years. Addicts can receive a massage or auricular acupuncture to help treat their addiction, on top of conventional detoxification treatment. Small lapses are tolerated in the first few months, but any major lapses lead to a reappearance in a special drugs court and a possible prison sentence. </p> <p>For Teri, one of Dasp's biggest success stories, the prospect of spending six months in prison was enough to persuade her to undergo treatment. She had started experimenting with drugs when she was 15, but it was not until she lost her job, at the age of 24, that her problems began. She had a live-in job at a hotel, but found herself homeless when the hotel suddenly closed down. </p> <p>Teri says: \"I was found somewhere to live in Truro which was full of dealers. I couldn't get a job and couldn't go back to college. I had nothing to do, so I started taking speed. After three or four months of playing about with speed, I started injecting. It was costing \u00a3500 a day so I started stealing and began shoplifting to order. If it cost more than \u00a310 and wasn't nailed down I would take it.\" </p> <p>She was caught several times and ended up on remand at Eastwood Park prison, Gloucester. With nine previous convictions for shoplifting and two for credit card fraud, she faced a minimum six-month jail sentence. Terrified by the prospect, she agreed to take part in the Dasp scheme as part of a two-year probation order. One of the conditions was spending the first 12 months living in a bail hostel in Camborne. </p> <p>After five months on the programme, Teri was allowed to leave the hostel as she had been clear of street drugs and had committed no further crimes. Shortly afterwards, she was off drugs completely, her probation order was revoked and she was in her own flat. Two months ago, she started a new job as a waitress in a hotel.</p> <p><strong>Tough route to success</strong></p> <p>Thirty-four people in Cornwall have been placed on a Dasp order, including eight women. Others were referred to the community drugs team, but assessed as not suitable. Half have succeeded, or are continuing on the programme. </p> <p>All have experienced a reduction in the use of street drugs; 78% no longer use them at all. Women are more likely to succeed than men; three-quarters of women succeeded. </p> <p>Amphetamine users achieved better outcomes than heroin users, and those aged 25-32 were more likely to succeed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "With the attention of the football world briefly turned away from the club game for this week's internationals, three Nationwide League managers lost their jobs yesterday. The biggest surprise came at Wigan, where the former Arsenal and Bolton manager Bruce Rioch resigned only eight months after his arrival, with his club fourth in the table and within hours of negotiating a club-record transfer. Colin Greenall, formerly player-coach, takes over as caretaker manager, and the \u00a31.35m bid for Motherwell's striker Lee McCulloch and defender Steve McMillan remains on the table having been accepted by the Scottish club. The other two departures had a ring of inevitability about them. Second Division Cambridge, after four successive defeats, sacked Roy McFarland, and Lincoln, who have lost five games in a row and are one point off the foot of the Third Division, terminated the contract of Phil Stant. It was a bad day too for Crystal Palace and Norwich, both charged by the FA after a mass brawl during their First Division match on February 17, after which two players were sent off. Both sides have been fined this season for similar offences. Chelsea's Celestine Babayaro also faces an FA charge - of violent conduct - for stamping on the Arsenal midfielder Freddie Ljungberg. His international side, Nigeria, have announced that they will play Japan in London on October 7; no venue has been chosen. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>Abbey National and Bank of Scotland are considering a complex plan to bring a continental European partner into their proposed merger. </p> <p>The move is one of the strategies being explored by the two banks as they look for ways to sweeten the terms of their planned merger and see off Lloyds TSB's unwanted \u00a319bn bid for Abbey. </p> <p>Abbey and BoS are understood to feel they have been given a chance to complete their attempted merger by the government's decision to refer the Lloyds bid to the competition commission for a full investigation. </p> <p>While a June 12 deadline has been set for the competition investigation, to be chaired by deputy commissioner Denise Kingsmill, it is unlikely to be published until mid-July. </p> <p>Abbey and BoS have been discussing a nil-premium merger, essentially an exchange of each other's shares, since last year. </p> <p>But they were effectively stalled when Lloyds TSB attempted to spoil the talks by making a bid for Abbey after its negotiations with BoS were leaked. </p> <p>While shareholders in Abbey and BoS might have been prepared to accept a merger before Lloyds' intervention, they are now expected to demand a higher price for Abbey's shares after Lloyds revealed it was willing to inject some cash into its offer. </p> <p>Speculation is mounting in the City that if BoS and Abbey decide to press ahead with their merger in the face of the competition investigation they will need to find a way of injecting that cash into their offer. </p> <p>One way of doing this would be forging an alliance with a large European company, most likely an insurance firm. If such a partner could be found, it might be able to allow the banks to argue to their shareholders that they have a clear, long-term strategy for growth, particularly in mainland Europe where Lloyds has promised to expand but is yet to announce a deal. </p> <p>It is not expected that the European partner would need to be involved in a three-way, full-scale merger. But it could involve the continental group paying cash for a stake in the combined group. This money would then be passed on to shareholders. </p> <p>Industry sources said last night it was far from clear that this scenario would be the one that was ultimately chosen. </p> <p>It is understood that Abbey and BoS, whose board met yesterday to discuss their options, have not yet decided whether to press ahead with their merger before the outcome of the competition investigation is known. </p> <p>Among the options being considered is to present the terms of the merger to shareholders before the end of March. </p> <p>This would allow the merger to be completed before mid-July when the Department of Trade and Industry will need to make its decision public. </p> <p>Shareholders, for now, are indicating that they would rather wait for the verdict from the competition commission as to whether the Lloyds TSB bid for Abbey would be against the public interest. </p> <p>Mrs Kingsmill, the deputy commissioner who will head the investigation, has run a number of high-profile inquiries, including the controversial study of car prices in Britain. </p> <p>She resigned her non-executive board position at Norwich and Peterborough Building Society last week to help avoid any accusations of bias.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Abbey National and Bank of Scotland are considering a complex plan to bring a continental European partner into their proposed merger. The move is one of the strategies being explored by the two banks as they look for ways to sweeten the terms of their planned merger and see off Lloyds TSB's unwanted \u00a319bn bid for Abbey. Abbey and BoS are understood to feel they have been given a chance to complete their attempted merger by the government's decision to refer the Lloyds bid to the competition commission for a full investigation. While a June 12 deadline has been set for the competition investigation, to be chaired by deputy commissioner Denise Kingsmill, it is unlikely to be published until mid-July. Abbey and BoS have been discussing a nil-premium merger, essentially an exchange of each other's shares, since last year. But they were effectively stalled when Lloyds TSB attempted to spoil the talks by making a bid for Abbey after its negotiations with BoS were leaked. While shareholders in Abbey and BoS might have been prepared to accept a merger before Lloyds' intervention, they are now expected to demand a higher price for Abbey's shares after Lloyds revealed it was willing to inject some cash into its offer. Speculation is mounting in the City that if BoS and Abbey decide to press ahead with their merger in the face of the competition investigation they will need to find a way of injecting that cash into their offer. One way of doing this would be forging an alliance with a large European company, most likely an insurance firm. If such a partner could be found, it might be able to allow the banks to argue to their shareholders that they have a clear, long-term strategy for growth, particularly in mainland Europe where Lloyds has promised to expand but is yet to announce a deal. It is not expected that the European partner would need to be involved in a three-way, full-scale merger. But it could involve the continental group paying cash for a stake in the combined group. This money would then be passed on to shareholders. Industry sources said last night it was far from clear that this scenario would be the one that was ultimately chosen. It is understood that Abbey and BoS, whose board met yesterday to discuss their options, have not yet decided whether to press ahead with their merger before the outcome of the competition investigation is known. Among the options being considered is to present the terms of the merger to shareholders before the end of March. This would allow the merger to be completed before mid-July when the Department of Trade and Industry will need to make its decision public. Shareholders, for now, are indicating that they would rather wait for the verdict from the competition commission as to whether the Lloyds TSB bid for Abbey would be against the public interest. Mrs Kingsmill, the deputy commissioner who will head the investigation, has run a number of high-profile inquiries, including the controversial study of car prices in Britain. She resigned her non-executive board position at Norwich and Peterborough Building Society last week to help avoid any accusations of bias.",
