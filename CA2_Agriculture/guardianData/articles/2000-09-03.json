It sounds like a revolution for the internet. </p> <p> Perhaps it is a revolution, but it won't happen overnight. At \u00a340 per month, the initial price of ADSL at home will still be beyond regular internet users. Pricing will come down as, from mid-2001, other telephone companies are allowed to compete with BT in supplying wholesale ADSL services to companies like Freeserve. Today BT is the sole provider. We need to see the price fall to between \u00a320 and \u00a330 a month before it finds a mass market. </p> <p> Freeserve's own high-speed internet service, FreeservePlus, has been in development for over a year. We launched a business service in early July, delivering low-cost access to small businesses that can't afford the cost of leased lines. The package includes access to Clearlybusiness.com, a small business portal provided by Freeserve and Barclays Bank. With domestic users, our aim is to build a large audience using this \"fat pipe\" into the home to experience the internet as it should be: a convenient and fast tool for communication, information and entertainment. </p> <p> The power of high-speed internet will be realised as content providers old and new start to enhance their sites and content. Since February, Freeserve has been building a showcase portal to demonstrate the capability of ADSL. The portal aggregates some of the best broad band content around from both old and new media. Among others, the portal offers news from ITN, music from Virgin Records, Music Choice, Peoplesound and Darkerthanblue, entertainment from Mentorn Barraclough Carey and Streets Online, and games from Gameplay. This portal will truly come of age when the broadband audience can produce healthy advertising and commerce revenues to support the cost of producing rich content. </p> <p> This new breed of content provider brings together the strengths of traditional and new media: strong, rich and creative production values combined with a more forward-thinking approach to business models. This will offer CD-quality music playlists with the ability to buy the CD being played. TV programmes will be remixed in to a format that is compatible with the \"lean forward\" PC experience. Adding advertising within content such as a preroll ad before a music video - the advertising banner may finally be put to rest. </p> <p> But this evolution doesn't come about without its problems. Copyright issues abound. Cutting up existing TV programmes, digging out short films from the archive or broadcasting music affects the copyright owners. I have been urging producers to hold on to their rights. To reuse or rebroadcast material that has been played out before on the main terrestrial channels usually means that at least some of the rights lie with the broadcaster. A good broadcaster would then want to use this content for its own gain. Even the largest production companies fall foul of the traditional commissioning practices of the broadcasters. </p> <p> Freeserve has embraced this problem area by working with companies who own their own rights and by trying to educate the new producers about the importance of ownership. However, rights ownership comes with a price. Traditional TV commissioning takes the risk out of content creation: upfront funding of the production by the broadcaster means a small company gets a guaranteed return on its investment. In the new media world, payment from an internet portal is usually a share of revenue earned from advertising and commerce. A shared risk model, then, but the rights stay with the creator. </p> <p> Our vision would see production companies seeking partnerships and distribution for their properties with new media companies before seeking distribution from broadcasters. This will enable productions to be created and optimised for both the new media and traditional media spaces from the very beginning. The development costs can be spread across multiple distribution platforms enabling the production company to be in a better position to keep its rights.</p> <p>\u0095 Peter Cowley is director of broadband and television at Freeserve.</p>",

The development costs can be spread across multiple distribution platforms enabling the production company to be in a better position to keep its rights. \u0095 Peter Cowley is director of broadband and television at Freeserve.",

Custic, 26, who works with the Norwich Union boat, has been involved in everything from sorting out the crew kit to organising food for the start. She joined the Croydon-based team only in June, and was immediately thrust into the thick of preparations for the world's most famous amateur yacht race. </p> <p>\"And there's a crisis almost every day,\" she admits, whether it's sending out rebranded clothing at short notice following the merger of the yacht's sponsor, insurance firm CGU, with Norwich Union, or chasing the crew's families and VIPs for replies to invitations to join a specially hired ferry for the send-off in Southampton. </p> <p>Quite a challenge for someone who describes herself as \"a complete landlubber\" with no previous sailing experience. That is, until an unusual perk of the job allowed her to try her hand at a day's sailing on the 72ft Norwich Union yacht. \"It was brilliant, apart from scraping my knuckles trying to hoist sails. I even had a go at the helm, and actually 'drove' the thing,\" she enthuses. \"And now I'm really bitten by the sailing bug.\" </p> <p>The BT Global Challenge 2000-2001 is the third such race and the brainchild of pioneering yachtsman Sir Chay Blyth. He wanted to give amateur sailors of all ages and backgrounds the chance of an adventure of a lifetime. But the experience comes at a price - each crew member, apart from the professional skippers, pays \u00a325,000 for the privilege of sharing cramped conditions for weeks on end and the prospect of monster seas. </p> <p>But all that is a long way away from Custic's busy office. \"There's so much to keep on top of - imagine organising a huge event, and then remember that it lasts for 10 months,\" she says. Her responsibilities are incredibly diverse: \"I distribute information before and during the race, provide regular updates to all staff, help keep the website <a href=\"http://www.CGNUchallenge.com\">www.CGNUchallenge.com</a> updated, write our internal monthly news- letter and liaise with our PR agency.\" </p> <p>Once the race has started, she'll also co-ordinate events with her boss, the project manager, who will be at all the stopovers, including Wellington and Cape Town. \"But, unfortunately, I'll be here in Croydon,\" she points out. </p> <p>She is contracted to work for the team only until next July, just after the race finishes, but Custic is used to short-term work. \"After I graduated from Southampton University with a degree in politics and international relations, I had to do some temping, which at least gave me office skills.\" </p> <p>A three-month stint at a London-based publishing company followed. \"After that I worked in marketing for Royal Vopak, an oil and chemical distribution company, for two years. That was great experience - having to talk to directors around the world at 3am or travelling to meetings at the Rotterdam headquarters.\" </p> <p>By chance, through that job, she met the sailmakers for the BT Global Challenge yachts, and they were able to give her useful background material for her Norwich Union interview. This job may be short-term, she says, but at least no two days are ever the same. \"The best thing is having complete ownership of a project, you really feel that you're achieving something. There's a great camaraderie and team spirit, too. We even get invited to the crew parties.\" </p> <p>So would she like to swap her job for a crew member's? \"I'd love to do just one leg, and if I had the money, maybe I'd think about doing the whole race, but I'd be petrified of the Southern Ocean! I certainly admire those who have the guts to do it.

And the study claims that although there are some lucky workers who do manage to switch off during time away, the mountain of work that awaits them on their return means their relaxed state has evaporated completely within days. In fact, claims another recent poll, by <a href=\"http://www.Totaljobs.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Totaljobs.com</a>, increasing numbers of employees are concluding that it's better not to take a break in the first place. </p> <p>\"The ever-increasing backlog of work that people return to is enough to make anyone incapable of unwinding while on holiday,\" says a spokesperson for Travelocity. Indeed, three-quarters of the survey's respondents said that they felt as though they'd never been away within a week of being back in the office. </p> <p>Paul Jacobs, corporate communications director for recruitment consultancy Office Angels, is not surprised. \"Today's secretaries are working an additional 40 hours to make up for time they take off, the equivalent of an extra week,\" he says. \"It tends to be 20 hours before and 20 hours after the break\" - which means office staff leave for their holidays exhausted and soon work off their revived energy when they return. </p> <p>\"In some European countries, and in some UK companies in the past, companies would close down for a designated period every year,\" says Jacobs. \"But that is almost unheard of in this country now. As a result, during the summer months, and especially around the school holidays, many organisations run on a skeleton workforce. This can have serious repercussions on the morale and productivity of staff by the time September has arrived.\" </p> <p>In fact, studies show that September sees the most dramatic demand for temporary staff, up 5.8% on the previous month. \"This echoes the almost desperate situation that the end of the summer can bring,\" says a spokesperson from recruitment consultancy Adecco. </p> <p>But stress management consultant Andrew Evans claims it's not all doom and gloom. \"Even if you don't feel like you've had a holiday, your body does recharge itself and so you will find it easier to cope - even if it's subconsciously,\" he says. </p> <p>There are ways of avoiding post-vacation stresses. Cary Cooper, professor of occupational psychology at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, advises that those returning to work should let the holiday \"spill over\" into the first few weeks of work. \"People should prioritise and do only the most important tasks,\" he said recently. \"They should also set an exit time for the first couple of weeks after they are back, and stick to it.\" </p> <p>Another solution is to have shorter, more frequent breaks. \"This option can help employees more than working like mad all year round, and just stopping for a couple of weeks every summer.\" </p> <p>When employees don't take time off at all, the most common reason is the extra hours involved in compensating for (or earning) a break, according to Totaljobs.com. \"But there are some additional reasons which differ among men and women,\" says Adele Kimber, the website's editor. \"When women don't take holidays, one reason can be down to guilt, although this is not for the sake of employers, but for colleagues. Women show more loyalty to supporting their teams and colleagues than men. Men take a much more individual approach to work, often being more ambitious and working hard to impress the boss.\" </p> <p>About 25% of workers admitted to missing out on their full holiday entitlement in a recent poll by Expedia. And, although lost leave is a nation-wide problem, employees in some parts of the country are suffering more than others. Scottish workers admit to losing the most number of days (four), closely followed by workers in London and the south-east (3.7). Many feel that they are indispensable, or that their work will not be covered by others while they are away, meaning more hours when they return. </p> <p>There are, of course, other reasons for not taking a break, such as being short on cash. After all, both Bermuda and Blackpool cost. But, says Laura Nichols, business psychologist at business consultancy Nicholson McBride, \"Even if you don't go away, you should take time off work. A few days at home can be just as effective.\" </p> <p>Evans believes employers are shooting themselves in the foot by allowing the \"September blues\" trend to continue. \"Staff morale and mental health are being severely affected,\" he says. \"In the long-term, employers will suffer as much as employees.\"</p>",

And despite the narrow palette of four identical instruments, the piece was almost as engaging for the variety of timbres and colours Ensemble Modern created as it was for the players' display of technical and rhythmic perfection. Music for 18 Musicians, composed in 1976, presents a much more varied line-up, with vocalists, string and wind players, pianists and percussionists. Reich adds a harmonic dimension to his music with this work and Ensemble Modern showed amazing stamina in sustaining their rhythmic precision over the course of the piece. Their articulation of the work's subtle changes of texture and rhythm made for a fascinatingly dramatic performance.",

Twenty employees of an international newspaper were fired for sending \"inappropriate and offensive\" email, and the US Navy disciplined more than 500 shore employees for sending sexually explicit messages over an electronic network. </p> <p>International courts have imposed millions of dollars in fines for sexual or racial harassment over company-based email; staff have gone to jail for it. So what price the employee's right to privacy in their email? </p> <p>It depends where you are. Europe and the US have different rules, which makes things tricky for multinational companies. American courts have historically taken the view that \"an employee's right to privacy is trumped by an employer's business interests\", and while staff have been challenging employer access to their email since 1990, commentators say that no employee has yet won a case. Typically, two Californians who were fired for \"inappropriate sexual humour\" in emails, and who filed a counterclaim for invasion of privacy, were told by the judge that they could not expect privacy in their use of equipment provided for company business. </p> <p>The law in Europe is different, says Rogerson.

The Mimesweeper email monitoring software has 5,000 users worldwide; the American Management Association spoke to 32,000 companies and found that one in seven reviewed messages.

The Integralis group questioned 800 FTSE-1000 companies, and found that, while the majority of directors accepted that email is misused, they had no awareness of \"cyberliabilities\" arising from cyberlibel, copyright infringement, breach of confidence, negligent virus transmission, inadvertent contracts, or computer hacking... and five of those six can be caused by any junior member of staff. </p> <p>Those employers who do monitor email use specialist software; simplistically, it is the \"find\" facility in text-processing, multiplied to a vast degree. Some software uses directories of undesirable words and phrases, and more complex ones allow custom-built dictionaries of certain words - perhaps the names of competitors or project names - which will alarm the system and capture messages. These are referred to an administrator, who checks the message and either lets it through or blows the whistle. </p> <p>Some employees have dubbed the products \"censorware\", but software houses protest that staff are not the target. Their software protects equally against incoming obscenity, spam and even mailbombing, as suffered by the two British companies brought to a standstill with 300,000 preprogrammed messages over a 10-hour period, or the Swedish medical research houses similarly bombarded by animal rights groups. Being \"censored\" would probably have saved the staffer in an international group who accidentally sent confidential personnel emails to a trade union; it could have saved the travel agency worker who mistakenly emailed his entire customer list to a competitor. </p> <p>It might even have stopped the defamatory email which the British manager of a gas distributor sent to a rival's staff - and could have saved his company \u00a3101,000 in libel. </p> <p>Joanne Ashley, of London lawyers Sprecher Grier Halberstam, organises seminars to help managers understand the full hazards of instant messaging, and why policies should be drawn up to protect staff and employer. \"Email has removed the safety net of drafting letters and getting them back to re-read and sign - once you've pressed the \"send\" button, you can't rush to the post room and get it back,\" she explains. </p> <p>Understanding comes before technology, agrees Dave Hunt of C2C Systems in London. Only when managers appreciate the full hazards of email can they realistically lay down a meaningful policy, and that understanding can require a very open mind. \"Whether you think tolerances in the UK are liberal or puritanical, they are certainly different from other countries,\" he says. \"Political, sexual and religious beliefs and rights vary widely and cannot be taken for granted.

As Simon Rogerson points out, there is already little control over who reads what - as any email can now be intentionally or accidentally forwarded to thousands of people at a keystroke, it is dangerous to assume any message will be read by only the addressee.

      "body": "<p>It's about being in control and being free,\" says New Zealander Tracey Ward, 30, who has worked as a temp for 12 years. \"I love the flexibility of being able to take holiday whenever I like, particularly as I have family on the other side of the world. No full-time employer would let me take 10 weeks holiday a year, or accept that I would work for them for only six months. But temping offers me the freedom to have total control over my life - when and where I work, how long for and how many weeks holiday I want to take.\" </p> <p>Ward is one of an increasing number of people who see temping as a permanent career choice, rather than as a stop-gap between jobs, post- college or pre-travelling. With contract and flexible working on the increase, temping is more acceptable than ever - and more appealing to a generation of workers who don't want the restrictions of a permanent job. </p> <p>\"We have temps who have been on our books for five years,\" says Samantha Webster, manager at Gordon Yates. \"There are all sorts of advantages to temping, primarily the flexibility, but also there is less responsibility, less involvement in office politics, and the chance constantly to meet new people and experience different situations. A lot of the long-term temps on our books use temping to finance another career - acting or writing - and they temp between those jobs.\" </p> <p>\"Temping is a fantastic way to keep regular money coming in if you have an irregular career,\" confirms freelance magazine journalist Joanne Morrison. \"Some months I can have a lot of commissions and don't need to temp; other times money can be really tight. It's great to know I can ring my agency one day, be in work the next, and have money in my bank account at the end of the following week. And it breaks up the isolation of working from home - I get to be in an office, chatting to new people, which really helps with generating ideas for my writing.\" </p> <p>\"Increasingly, I think a lot of people see work as a way to fund other interests - and temping is a perfect way to do this,\" says Helene Miller, director of the temporaries division at Roc Recruitment. \"Some people temp to enable them to travel - they work, go away for a few months and then come back and work again. I have other long-term temps who are mothers, who want the flexibility of not working in the school holidays.\" </p> <p>Convenience aside, Morrison believes that even if she were to make a comfortable living from writing, she would still temp now and then. \"I've been temping on and off for four years,\" she says, \"and I have several companies that always ask for me - and I've worked for them often enough to have made lots of friends. I really enjoy the social side of temping. You're often invited down to the pub, or for drinks after work, but rather than the same faces week after week, it's a different crowd.\" </p> <p>Many people dismiss temping as a career choice, believing that most temp positions consist of little more than endless typing and stuffing envelopes, but for long-term temps, this is rarely the case. </p> <p>\"I have career temps who are requested again and again by the same clients,\" says Miller. \"It's great for the temp - they hit the ground running, they know the company and the staff, and they are given a good degree of responsibility. Employers are far more accepting about career-temps these days. Most understand that the concept of a job for life is pretty outdated and that people want the kind of flexibility and freedom afforded by temping.\" </p> <p>Another common worry about temping is that the work is irregular - unlike the reliability of a permanent job with a regular pay cheque. \"In my experience, if you're a good temp you'll be kept in plenty of work,\" says Ward. \"I consider myself a 'professional' temp - I never go into a job and think I don't have to care about it because I'm only temporary. If work needs doing, then I'll stay late until it's done. I take pride in my work, and don't see why it should be any less well done simply because I'm not a permanent member of staff.\" </p> <p>As the structure of the workplace changes, the perception of temping as an insecure, inadequate way to make a living is no longer relevant. Instead it is a seriously viable option for the increasing number of people who value freedom and flexibility - and fresh faces every few weeks. \"I've been offered plenty of jobs,\" says Ward. \"But I'm rarely tempted to take them. I love the fact that each job is only as permanent as I want it to be - and that there's always something new on the horizon.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A major row has erupted between some of Britain's biggest retailers and the high street banks over advanced plans to introduce new \"smart cards\", which the stores fear will be expensive to process, lead to longer queues at tills and make big dents on their profits. During a series of meetings during the summer, retailers have told the banks that they do not believe they should be expected to subsidise the cost of the new technology required to make the cards work at their tills. They also fear the banks will use the smart cards, which contain tiny computer chips and are intended to replace the magnetic strips on existing credit and debit cards, as an excuse to increase the cost of processing card transactions. Nearly six million of these smart cards have been issued already to replace the 120 million cards in use in Britain. The dispute with the retailers also threatens to delay tentative plans by the banks to introduce keyboards at tills where customers will enter their pin (personal identification numbers) each time they make a card transaction. Very few retailers have installed the technology at their tills to handle the computer chips that are being incorporated into the cards as part of the banks' fight against fraud. Early tests have also worried retailers by showing that the new cards, because of the additional information they contain, can take up to four seconds longer to process, which retailers fear will quickly build up into longer queues and lost sales. \"That, I can assure you, will cost millions of pounds a year,\" one leading retailer said. Another senior retailer, while stressing that discussions with the banks were still continuing, said it is unlikely that any of the major retail chains would be prepared to carry the cost of installing new equipment at the tills because few of them are able to see the benefit they will reap themselves. \"What retailers see is a new piece of technology that is slower at point of sale, but offers nothing for retailers. It just protects the banks from fraud,\" the senior retailer said. While the banks and retailers have been in negotiations over the situation for as long as three years and have started to make some progress on reaching agreement, retailers believe the banks still have more ground to give to make the smart cards viable. \"If there isn't a shift in attitude by the banks fairly soon, it's going to become a real issue,\" the senior retailer said. While the retailers are concerned about the cost of installing the equipment, which the banks have agreed to subsidise in part, they believe the banks may use the new cards as an excuse to increase the fees they are charged by banks for card transactions.

Inspired by one of their more diffident cricketers, Craig White, England ripped to shreds a West Indian upper order that is now as brittle as an autumnal leaf. The hapless tourists were dismissed for another paltry total, 125 - a deficit of 156 runs. By the close of another interrupted day, England, disappointed only by a pair for their captain, had advanced their lead by another 56 runs. There is surely no way back for West Indies from here. </p> <p>At 11.30 yesterday the tourists were content with their lot. Somehow they had nullified the threat of the new ball, so skilfully used by Darren Gough and Andrew Caddick. The ball had beaten the bat frequently; the odd lbw shout had been declined and the tourists, in the form of Sherwin Campbell and Adrian Griffith, were battling away diligently. By 12 o'clock they were 39 for five and the series was effectively over. </p> <p>As usual, the collapse began with the dismissal of Campbell. He had reached 20 in arguably his best, though by no means his highest, innings of the series. Caddick had been at his most testing, but the little Barbadian had left the ball with superb judgement, his footwork precise, his mind on the job. Maybe the introduction of Dominic Cork sent a signal to his mind that the worst was over, that the threat had receded. He relaxed and to Cork's third delivery he pushed lazily and the ball ricocheted from his inside edge on to the stumps. Cork looks a blander bowler than Caddick-his pace and bounce are less threatening - but he commands more respect than that. As do his figures in this series - eight wickets at ten apiece. </p> <p>Thereafter there was mayhem. In the next over, bowled by White, Griffith squeezed a full-length delivery to second slip, where Graeme Hick took a stinging catch. Out came Brian Lara. Unfair though it may be, all at the Oval concluded that the outcome of the game rested upon his contribution. He was the one West Indian who could turn this match around. He lasted one ball. </p> <p>White glided in and propelled the ball fast and full. Lara shuffled across his stumps - as left-handers do - and the ball eluded his pads before sending the leg-stump cartwheeling. This was Lara's fifth Test duck and his first golden one. The English players huddled spontaneously. They knew then that the match should be theirs. None of the other West Indian batsmen could hurt them. </p> <p>In the next over Wavell Hinds, half-forward, was lbw to a Cork inswinger. Hinds has had some dodgy decisions throughout this series and before departure he waved his bat to indicate that he'd just received another one. Batsmen are not the best witnesses in these cases; the ball may have hit his bat but only after thudding into his pad, in which case Umpire Shepherd's decision was correct. </p> <p>Ramnaresh Sarwan struck one sweet on-drive from White for four. He thought he was about to collect another boundary when driving square of the wicket only to see Marcus Trescothick dive to his right in the gully to pull off a stunning catch. Trescothick's presence in the side adds to a close-catching capability which already aspires to Antipodean standards. </p> <p>When Jimmy Adams nibbled at Cork to present a straightforward catch to Hick at second slip, his opposite number, Nasser Hussain, was confronted with a problem that he had not envisaged at the start of the day: whether to enforce the follow-on. At that stage West Indies, on 51 for six, were still 31 runs adrift of the follow-on target. </p> <p>In fact he did not have to make this decision as, briefly, West Indies rallied. Mahendra Nagamootoo, uncluttered by recent failures, took eleven runs from a Cork over, but soon allowed Trescothick to confirm his catching prowess in the gully. </p> <p>Enter Curtly Ambrose, who had dredged up his last reserves of energy in 31 impeccable overs in the English first innings. All in vain. Now he dragged his bat behind him lugubriously and with an exhausted air of resignation. So it was no surprise that he should swing at his first ball, miss it and be lbw. After this, there is surely no chance of Ambrose changing his mind about not touring Australia; and I doubt very much whether Courtney Walsh will be Down Under either. West Indies will travel to Australia this winter with the same barren expectations that accompanied touring sides to the Caribbean not so long ago. </p> <p>After lunch, there was a flurry of runs as Nixon McLean unveiled a couple of quality drives alongside an untroubled Ridley Jacobs. Their partnership of 45 was easily the highest of the innings. But White returned with sufficient menace to bowl McLean off the inside edge and then to remove Walsh's off-stump. White's five for 32 bettered career-best figures achieved in the last Test at Headingley. His transformation from 'bit' bowler to front-liner has been incredibly rapid and highly significant to England's future. Congratulations to him but also to Duncan Fletcher, who recognised his talents and then persuaded him how good he was. No doubt Illy, who first picked White back in 1994, will also give himself a little pat on the back. </p> <p>When England batted, Ambrose's pride demanded a final effort and he produced one. He was as unrelenting as ever and in his seventh over Trescothick edged him into the slips. Then Hussain collected a pair, the first in his career, when lbw to McLean before the clouds closed in. He will be grumpy about that but there should be major compensations around the corner.</p>",

When Jimmy Adams nibbled at Cork to present a straightforward catch to Hick at second slip, his opposite number, Nasser Hussain, was confronted with a problem that he had not envisaged at the start of the day: whether to enforce the follow-on. At that stage West Indies, on 51 for six, were still 31 runs adrift of the follow-on target. In fact he did not have to make this decision as, briefly, West Indies rallied. Mahendra Nagamootoo, uncluttered by recent failures, took eleven runs from a Cork over, but soon allowed Trescothick to confirm his catching prowess in the gully. Enter Curtly Ambrose, who had dredged up his last reserves of energy in 31 impeccable overs in the English first innings. All in vain. Now he dragged his bat behind him lugubriously and with an exhausted air of resignation. So it was no surprise that he should swing at his first ball, miss it and be lbw. After this, there is surely no chance of Ambrose changing his mind about not touring Australia; and I doubt very much whether Courtney Walsh will be Down Under either. West Indies will travel to Australia this winter with the same barren expectations that accompanied touring sides to the Caribbean not so long ago. After lunch, there was a flurry of runs as Nixon McLean unveiled a couple of quality drives alongside an untroubled Ridley Jacobs. Their partnership of 45 was easily the highest of the innings. But White returned with sufficient menace to bowl McLean off the inside edge and then to remove Walsh's off-stump. White's five for 32 bettered career-best figures achieved in the last Test at Headingley. His transformation from 'bit' bowler to front-liner has been incredibly rapid and highly significant to England's future. Congratulations to him but also to Duncan Fletcher, who recognised his talents and then persuaded him how good he was. No doubt Illy, who first picked White back in 1994, will also give himself a little pat on the back. When England batted, Ambrose's pride demanded a final effort and he produced one. He was as unrelenting as ever and in his seventh over Trescothick edged him into the slips. Then Hussain collected a pair, the first in his career, when lbw to McLean before the clouds closed in. He will be grumpy about that but there should be major compensations around the corner.",

      "body": "<p>I am delighted that England are on the brink of their first series win against West Indies since 1969. As an Englishman, I wouldn't want anything else, and it will do wonders for the game in this country if it comes to pass - right down to the grass roots. </p> <p>But - and isn't there always a but? - we have to thank West Indies for making us look a good side. I am not sure that we are just yet, and there are several pointers in the current Test before we start getting carried away about what we might do to the Australians next year. </p> <p>First, let us examine the performances of Nasser Hussain. He went into this Test with a series average of 15.2 runs and has never looked like scoring. Hussain was left forlorn in the Oval pavilion last night after bagging his first pair. A duck on Thursday, when England's fine opening partnership had only just been broken, was miserable enough; a second yesterday - trapped lbw by Nixon McLean - took the biscuit. </p> <p>But who can be surprised? When Hussain broke a finger and had to miss the second Test at Lord's, Michael Vaughan and Atherton did a superb job as England won by two wickets to square the series - yet what happened next did neither England nor Hussain any favours. The skipper almost immediately declared himself fit and returned when the series resumed. He was struggling before his injury and has continued to struggle since. </p> <p>I am not questioning his undoubted ability, but he is not playing well enough this summer to justify his place, even if he is a good leader. By continuing to pick a non-playing captain - or surely a non-batting one - the rest of the side's balance is compromised. </p> <p>Look at this Oval Test. The selectors - not surprisingly - elected to include a spinner in the squad as, after all, Surrey's HQ has proved a happy hunting ground for spinners, notably Phil Tufnell, in recent years. But the selectors opted not for Tufnell but Ashley Giles and then, having chosen Giles and upset Tufnell, they couldn't find a place in the final 11 for Giles. </p> <p>Why? Could it be something to do with Graeme Hick batting at No7?. Why on earth is a batsman with more than 100 centuries to his name batting at seven? I'll tell you why - he's there as an insurance policy against our lower order folding like a pack of cards, although some might argue that having Hick as insurance in a Test match is a very high-risk policy indeed. </p> <p>The same whispers around the England camp suggest that Giles got the nod over Tufnell because he might contribute a lot more with the bat. There you have it again, a defensive attitude prompted by our inferiority complex on batting. I had been labouring under the misapprehension that a spinner's job was to attack and take wickets and, if that were the case, there's nobody better at the moment for England than Tufnell. No wonder he's upset. </p> <p>Upset, also, at missing the winter tour. Instead his place has gone not to Giles, nor to Chris Schofield of Lancashire, but to Ian Salisbury, making a return to the Test scene after an unhappy experience a few years ago. But why? Salisbury, with respect, does not take wickets, he buys them. I don't know why he is back in favour if he takes his wickets at 70 runs a time. Perhaps bowling in tandem with Saqlain at Surrey has made him look good because batsmen are being tied down at one end and chance their arm with Salisbury at the other. </p> <p>England need to have confidence in their batting order and pick their best bowlers to attack. In this department there has been some good news this summer. Andy Caddick is undoubtedly our best new-ball bowler and he'll remain potent if he remembers to keep the ball pitched up an extra couple of feet on the length he has tended to bowl in the past. His height means that he will still achieve the bounce he wants. </p> <p>Darren Gough, too, has bowled well and in Vaughan and Trescothick there is a real feeling that we have emerging batsmen of determination and class. The touring squad will, however, need to be on their mettle to get through a tricky-looking winter tour to Pakistan and Sri Lanka with their recently restored reputations intact. </p> <p>For the moment, though, let's prepare to savour a series win against the West Indies. It has been a long time coming (I'd only just retired last time we beat them in '69) and the team deserve every credit.</p>",

When Hussain broke a finger and had to miss the second Test at Lord's, Michael Vaughan and Atherton did a superb job as England won by two wickets to square the series - yet what happened next did neither England nor Hussain any favours. The skipper almost immediately declared himself fit and returned when the series resumed. He was struggling before his injury and has continued to struggle since. I am not questioning his undoubted ability, but he is not playing well enough this summer to justify his place, even if he is a good leader. By continuing to pick a non-playing captain - or surely a non-batting one - the rest of the side's balance is compromised. Look at this Oval Test. The selectors - not surprisingly - elected to include a spinner in the squad as, after all, Surrey's HQ has proved a happy hunting ground for spinners, notably Phil Tufnell, in recent years. But the selectors opted not for Tufnell but Ashley Giles and then, having chosen Giles and upset Tufnell, they couldn't find a place in the final 11 for Giles. Why? Could it be something to do with Graeme Hick batting at No7?. Why on earth is a batsman with more than 100 centuries to his name batting at seven? I'll tell you why - he's there as an insurance policy against our lower order folding like a pack of cards, although some might argue that having Hick as insurance in a Test match is a very high-risk policy indeed. The same whispers around the England camp suggest that Giles got the nod over Tufnell because he might contribute a lot more with the bat. There you have it again, a defensive attitude prompted by our inferiority complex on batting. I had been labouring under the misapprehension that a spinner's job was to attack and take wickets and, if that were the case, there's nobody better at the moment for England than Tufnell. No wonder he's upset. Upset, also, at missing the winter tour. Instead his place has gone not to Giles, nor to Chris Schofield of Lancashire, but to Ian Salisbury, making a return to the Test scene after an unhappy experience a few years ago. But why? Salisbury, with respect, does not take wickets, he buys them. I don't know why he is back in favour if he takes his wickets at 70 runs a time. Perhaps bowling in tandem with Saqlain at Surrey has made him look good because batsmen are being tied down at one end and chance their arm with Salisbury at the other. England need to have confidence in their batting order and pick their best bowlers to attack. In this department there has been some good news this summer. Andy Caddick is undoubtedly our best new-ball bowler and he'll remain potent if he remembers to keep the ball pitched up an extra couple of feet on the length he has tended to bowl in the past. His height means that he will still achieve the bounce he wants. Darren Gough, too, has bowled well and in Vaughan and Trescothick there is a real feeling that we have emerging batsmen of determination and class. The touring squad will, however, need to be on their mettle to get through a tricky-looking winter tour to Pakistan and Sri Lanka with their recently restored reputations intact. For the moment, though, let's prepare to savour a series win against the West Indies. It has been a long time coming (I'd only just retired last time we beat them in '69) and the team deserve every credit.",

West Indies have made four of their worst Test scores in the past 18 months and have struggled three times in their last three Tests to pass their lowest-ever score of 51 against Australia at the Queen's Park Oval in 1999. </p> <p>Anyone with half a brain can add up these figures to the same total: disaster. Nevertheless, every cricket-lover in the world knows deep in his heart that you count out the West Indies at your peril. The match may well be over and lost today, but who would have staked his life, last Thursday morning, that the West Indies would not have won? </p> <p>The same team that mucked about for four days in January defended 98 runs on the last day to avoid humiliation by Zimbabwe. The same team that made the 51 in 1999 beat world champions Australia in the next two Tests. The same team that make 54 in the second innings make 400 in the first. Even if they have already lost the Wisden Trophy, the West Indies remain capable of springing back to beat Australia (though even the most patriotic West Indian would consider it unlikely). </p> <p>Any attempt to understand Caribbean cricket that does not fuse the scientific evidence the brain so easily processes with the Truth the heart cannot deny will simply fail. </p> <p>The causes of the rot have long been recognised: massive neglect by incompetent West Indies cricket boards; the changing of ICC rules to weaken the West Indies pace attack (and the blind insistence on sticking to the four-fast-bowlers formula although only two have been available for years); the influence of American basketball; the complacency falsely based on the successes of teams trained on English county cricket; the relatively small populations separated by water and distance from which to draw; a mediocre inter-island regional competition; and a furious inter-island rivalry that precludes even the most perspicacious of West Indians from judging clearly any issue relating to a player from his own jurisdiction. </p> <p>The rot is impossible to deny, but there still remains a great deal of wood and the grain is still the finest. Even at this dismal stage, even the uninformed spectator can discern that West Indies cricket is played at a spiritual level far higher than any other, even Pakistan's, who play for their God. </p> <p>Fifty years ago, in Beyond a Boundary, the late CLR James, who was born in Trinidad and died in Brixton, argued the case for cricket as Art. Thirty years ago, Robert Pirsig argued, in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, that Quality (or, for these purposes, Art) exists at the nexus of the conflicting but equally valid Scientific and Spiritual approaches to all human endeavour. Two years ago, in Beyond Belief , VS Naipaul explained the fatal difficulty facing any fervent believer when confronted with a problem requiring a secular solution: the answer of the believer is always a more fervent belief, which will do if what is needed is a spiritual or mental solution, but is lethal if what is missing is something entirely practical, such as economic growth or net practice. The person who relies upon faith alone is incapable of solving his secular problem and indeed only compounds it. </p> <p>Before the West Indies take the field, they say a team prayer. Brian Lara and Curtly Ambrose, asked if they believe in God, reply, 'Of course!' with the contemptuous look they usually reserve for a part-time bowler or batsman. God has played a bigger part in West Indies cricket than he, she or it has in any other nation's. (Again, with the possible exception of only Pakistan.) </p> <p>West Indies cricket, at its best, is CLR James's Art played at Robert Pirsig's point of Quality, where the scientific and emotional approaches meet and fuse into something far greater. No matter how successful it was, though, it was always played unconsciously. Players got their spiritual or emotional input on the beaches of the Caribbean and their net practice on English county grounds and no one gave training a moment's thought or respect. </p> <p>Courtney Walsh, when he became captain, asked for one change in the team uniform: that the crest be placed over the left and not the right breast, to reflect the team's conviction that they played from the heart. The emotional side of the game has always been far more important to the West Indian because the West Indies as a nation does not exist beyond the boundary. The cricket square is Westminster and the Queen and the Beatles and Disraeli and Gladstone and fish-and-chips and the NHS. It is all the West Indian people have that defines them as themselves. </p> <p>For 15 years, West Indies, playing unconscious Quality cricket dominated the world. When the team first began losing (or, to be accurate, not winning all the time), the kind of practical solution the Australians found in their Academy became necessary.

      "bodyText": "By today, the fifth Test should be over. It is now all but inconceivable that a cricket match involving the West Indies should go into the fourth day and only an unusually good West Indian performance or unusually bad weather can make even the third day a sure thing. England, as every Englishman will always remember and no West Indian will ever forget, needed only two days to wrap up the fourth Test. West Indies have made four of their worst Test scores in the past 18 months and have struggled three times in their last three Tests to pass their lowest-ever score of 51 against Australia at the Queen's Park Oval in 1999. Anyone with half a brain can add up these figures to the same total: disaster. Nevertheless, every cricket-lover in the world knows deep in his heart that you count out the West Indies at your peril. The match may well be over and lost today, but who would have staked his life, last Thursday morning, that the West Indies would not have won? The same team that mucked about for four days in January defended 98 runs on the last day to avoid humiliation by Zimbabwe. The same team that made the 51 in 1999 beat world champions Australia in the next two Tests. The same team that make 54 in the second innings make 400 in the first. Even if they have already lost the Wisden Trophy, the West Indies remain capable of springing back to beat Australia (though even the most patriotic West Indian would consider it unlikely). Any attempt to understand Caribbean cricket that does not fuse the scientific evidence the brain so easily processes with the Truth the heart cannot deny will simply fail. The causes of the rot have long been recognised: massive neglect by incompetent West Indies cricket boards; the changing of ICC rules to weaken the West Indies pace attack (and the blind insistence on sticking to the four-fast-bowlers formula although only two have been available for years); the influence of American basketball; the complacency falsely based on the successes of teams trained on English county cricket; the relatively small populations separated by water and distance from which to draw; a mediocre inter-island regional competition; and a furious inter-island rivalry that precludes even the most perspicacious of West Indians from judging clearly any issue relating to a player from his own jurisdiction. The rot is impossible to deny, but there still remains a great deal of wood and the grain is still the finest. Even at this dismal stage, even the uninformed spectator can discern that West Indies cricket is played at a spiritual level far higher than any other, even Pakistan's, who play for their God. Fifty years ago, in Beyond a Boundary, the late CLR James, who was born in Trinidad and died in Brixton, argued the case for cricket as Art. Thirty years ago, Robert Pirsig argued, in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, that Quality (or, for these purposes, Art) exists at the nexus of the conflicting but equally valid Scientific and Spiritual approaches to all human endeavour. Two years ago, in Beyond Belief , VS Naipaul explained the fatal difficulty facing any fervent believer when confronted with a problem requiring a secular solution: the answer of the believer is always a more fervent belief, which will do if what is needed is a spiritual or mental solution, but is lethal if what is missing is something entirely practical, such as economic growth or net practice. The person who relies upon faith alone is incapable of solving his secular problem and indeed only compounds it. Before the West Indies take the field, they say a team prayer. Brian Lara and Curtly Ambrose, asked if they believe in God, reply, 'Of course!' with the contemptuous look they usually reserve for a part-time bowler or batsman. God has played a bigger part in West Indies cricket than he, she or it has in any other nation's. (Again, with the possible exception of only Pakistan.) West Indies cricket, at its best, is CLR James's Art played at Robert Pirsig's point of Quality, where the scientific and emotional approaches meet and fuse into something far greater. No matter how successful it was, though, it was always played unconsciously. Players got their spiritual or emotional input on the beaches of the Caribbean and their net practice on English county grounds and no one gave training a moment's thought or respect. Courtney Walsh, when he became captain, asked for one change in the team uniform: that the crest be placed over the left and not the right breast, to reflect the team's conviction that they played from the heart. The emotional side of the game has always been far more important to the West Indian because the West Indies as a nation does not exist beyond the boundary. The cricket square is Westminster and the Queen and the Beatles and Disraeli and Gladstone and fish-and-chips and the NHS. It is all the West Indian people have that defines them as themselves. For 15 years, West Indies, playing unconscious Quality cricket dominated the world. When the team first began losing (or, to be accurate, not winning all the time), the kind of practical solution the Australians found in their Academy became necessary. What was offered, however, was the answer of the fervent believer: forget this crap about taking the shine off the new ball or playing yourself in! Attack the ball! Play your natural game! Which, of course, was right, and plugged directly into the critical emotional aspect of West Indies cricket; except that it failed to admit that the West Indian 'natural' emotional game has always included the ignored scientific element of training. Believing more fervently could never solve the secular problems of, say, the limitation of overseas players in English county cricket or the number of bouncers per over when what was needed was, say, an enhanced regional competition or a greater reliance on spin. But from the great Sir Viv to the lowliest spectator at the back of the highest stand, the answer was greater Faith. Attack the ball and trust in God that West Indies would achieve whatever was necessary on the day, whether that was to bowl a team out twice or make 400 runs in two sessions; if all else failed, He would send three days of rain. Of course, it could not work. Quality exists only at the nexus of the two approaches; however much of one you have cannot compensate for not having enough of the other. Faith thus failed West Indian cricket and, first the team, and then the nation, stopped believing in itself. More emphasis was placed on training and technique and less on playing the natural game; and now, after a decade of uncertainty, the short leg is the emotional aspect of Quality and the team still limps. Only when extreme pressure, such as the prospect of being beaten at home by Zimbabwe or, perhaps, losing the Wisden trophy, concentrates their minds can the team bring the scientific and spiritual elements of their game together into the compound of Quality. West Indian cricket is not dead, whatever the result of the Oval Test. To be sure it is ailing, but the disease is treatable. However, no accurate prognosis can be made without first the correct diagnosis. What is necessary is that West Indians come to understand their own process. West Indian cricket writing, particularly that of Tony Cozier, is now its most valuable resource. Rudi Webster, the psychologist who helped bring the team back from the humiliation of South Africa, or someone like him, should be a permanent member of the coaching staff. But on no account should anyone be excused from net practice. West Indian cricket is still just a tilt of the head away from glory.

      "body": "<p>After the double, the quits. French football today wakes up to a new dawn now that Didier eschamps has carried his final bucket of water and Laurent Blanc has planted his last lucky smooch onto the head of Fabien Barthez. After 11 years of service during which they have amassed 200 caps between them, a nation bids au revoir to two men whose influence in helping France to become the finest team on the planet has been monumental. Merci, as they clink their Pastis, pour les souvenirs . </p> <p>With Cantona-esque timing, they have bowed out at the summit. Although Blanc, 33 years old and counting, had made his decision before the European Championship climax Deschamps was struck by a sudden feeling of finality almost the instant David Trezeguet's golden goal soared into the Italian net. Whilst the rest of the team frolicked on the turf in Rotterdam Deschamps was absorbed by the feeling that his endgame had come. It could get no better. Roger Lemerre embraced him and there, in the middle of the pitch, he admitted privately to his manager that it was over. Their conversation was caught by the camera's eye and later on the media employed lip-reading experts to decipher their exchange. The gist of it was that Lemerre urged Deschamps not to be rash but his mind was made up. </p> <p>'When I say I stop, I stop.' He can't bear the thought of playing the infamous match-too-much. In a way France's success has contributed to his retirement because as World Champions they don't need to qualify for the next tournament in 2002, and the idea of playing two years of friendlies no longer hits the spot. Lemerre suggested he could pick and choose his matches but Deschamps replied that the captain of France should not be on the bench. He is (although Chelsea might query this) an all or nothing player. This is a man who stood up to Bernard Tapie at Marseille when most players were far too intimidated to even utter a word, and the man whose club CV includes two European Cups and three Italian titles. Of France he says: 'I gave all my energy, my faculties, my time, my heart and my spirit.' </p> <p>The farewell was delayed to include two more friendly matches so that he and Blanc could properly savour the 'after Euro 2000 party'. They have soaked up the adulation of Marseille, France's footballing hotbed, in a charity match against the Fifa All Stars and now the emotional curtain call at the Stade de France, stage for their most golden of days. </p> <p>In their 11 years they have witnessed sweeping changes. From crowds of 25,000 at the Parc des Princes, through gut-wrenching failure to qualify for World Cups, to the ultimate highs. 'When I was younger we just tried not to lose,' reminisces Blanc. 'Since I began we have become a club, a family, with our ups and downs. I've known some very deep downs but from the bottom we rose to be World Champions.' </p> <p>So Les Bleus are left with a treasure chest full of memories. Few players anywhere have been as incessantly successful as 'Dede', a Frenchman's Frenchman, the little big boss with his puffed out chest, scampering legs, and arms best remembered for the unique achievement of hoisting both of football's most glamorous international trophies. </p> <p>Then there is 'Lolo', as loved for his Mr Ordinary demeanour and philosophical ease as his supremely cultured defending. When his country fumed as he missed the World Cup Final, victim of an undeserved red card brandished after Croatia's Slaven Bilic took play-acting to a tasteless new level, Blanc refused to apportion blame. When romantics tried to hail the Euro 2000 triumph as 'his' final because of his prior misfortune he politely brushed them aside. It was not his, he countered, it was the team's. You'd expect nothing less from one of the game's good guys. He looks like he goes to a twenty franc barber, he smokes when he wants to, and his manager at Inter Milan raves about him so much Sir Alex Ferguson hasn't a hope of prising him away. </p> <p>Blanc is known as Le President, Deschamps is Le Capitaine, and their legacy is huge. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger suspects France will suffer from the dual retirement of two of the truest of Blues. He believes they are the heartbeat of the side, men of immense experience and mental fortitude who pull all the strands together. </p> <p>The pep talks that Deschamps gave Zinedine Zidane during the World Cup were detailed, inspiring, almost the work of a manager. And what better example of Blanc's status than the moment he took the tactical initiative to push himself up front in extra time in the quarter-final against a brilliantly resistant Paraguay - he rammed home the golden goal. </p> <p>Their influence on the younger members of the squad is immense. As Thierry Henry reflects: 'In a group the most important thing is respect and while it's normal for us to have respect for more experienced players they respected us too. They were very nice to us, advising us how to be if we want to have a good career. I'll miss them as people and players. They were exceptional.' </p> <p>It may take a while for France to recover the sense of leadership, experience, camaraderie, and tactical sophistication which stemmed from them. Marcel Desailly, exemplary stopper as he is, benefits so much from the built-in understanding he shares with Blanc. France are hoping Patrick Vieira will develop the maturity which will see them through when Emmanuel Petit is having one of his introspective or over-emotional days. </p> <p>It is hard to imagine much of a dip on the horizon when France have such gifted understudies in the wings. Vieira can bring something extra to the midfield party and Lilian Thuram, consistently admired for his defensive qualities in Italy, can move calmly into the centre, allowing Vincent Candela - another who has blossomed in the uncompromising world of calcio - to step in on the right. </p> <p>The departure of Deschamps (who has captained his country more times than anyone else) means the armband is up for grabs. Desailly is tipped for the honour. The feeling is that Zidane - another popular choice - doesn't need the extra responsibility because he is already commanding, in his own radiant way. </p> <p>'It's a new chapter but we have to turn the page and I hope everything will go well,' concludes Henry. If they find a new singer to take over from Deschamps leading the dressing room theme tune of Gloria Gaynor's I Will Survive, they might just be all right.</p>",

They gathered to pay tribute to retiring heroes and bask in their eminence. Booming Queen's We Are The Champions seemed like rubbing noses noses in the merdre: England supply the music, but only those with French accents could sing along. The wolf whistling, for their visitors, was more derisory than daunting. Look, they were chuckling, at the state you're in. </p> <p>Unimaginably swiftly, they were stunned into silence. Dennis Wise clobbered the mighty Zinedine Zidane before you could say excusez-moi and England began to play. Maybe, just maybe, England's super-optimistic manager doesn't have his head far above the clouds after all. </p> <p>A few subtle changes were rung but collectively a good deal has changed since the morale-sapping mediocrity of a sorry summer in the Low Countries. A natural left- footer was employed in place of the ill-starred Phil Neville. David Beckham, the one English player viewed on foreign shores as genuinely world class, was handed the reins in the centre and sparkled. An adapted formation, with Paul Scholes tucking in behind Andy Cole, made England less predictable. 'It's a bit like the Manchester United shape, as opposed to Michael Owen and Alan Shearer alongside each other,' noted Scholes. </p> <p>He reckoned this contest was a 'great chance to get a bit of pride back after Euro 2000, to do it against the best team in the world'. After a slick opening spell when Bernard Lama's goal was liberally peperred, France must have been wondering who these imposters in white were. They suddenly looked oddly composed on the ball. Keegan had asked them to take responsibility and nobody shirked. Each individual imposed himself more than was evident under Shearer's uneasy leadership. </p> <p>A French observer, wide eyed at half-time, exclaimed: 'England can play football!' Order, in his eyes, was restored when Emmanuel Petit opened the scoring and France began to flow forward in the manner to which they are accustomed. Enter Michael Owen, and England were able to take even more than mended pride from this hotly competitive friendly. </p> <p>As a rehearsal before the real deal begins again with Germany and a potentially slippery trip to Finland next month, it inspired fresh hope. Didier Deschamps, as he rides off into the sunset with his international cap fully feathered, had given England a parting shot: if you don't improve fast, you won't qualify for the next World Cup. </p> <p>French footballers sniffing at the English game is something we are used to by now (lyrical outpourings from Messieurs Anelka, Petit and Leboeuf spring to mind). But, given their global supremacy at the moment, and their experience of a successful system, perhaps they are not the worst judges around. Robert Pires, only two weeks into his English experience, made some interesting observations about his first impressions in L'Equipe . </p> <p>He explained how he was glad to sample his initial taste from the bench, at Arsenal's opening game at Sunderland. 'Watching that first half fightened me. It even shocked me. English football is a fight, a street fight at times,' he said. 'They spend their time provoking you, insulting you and getting on your nerves. The English make enormous use of their elbows and pull shirts. They know refs let them play on and take maximum advantage of it.' </p> <p>But it is his response to this, a typical one for French footballing troubadours, which sums up why their team have evolved into such a potent force: 'I have to adapt to English football without losing any of my own qualities. If I have to use my arms to avoid getting split eyebrows every match, I will do so. If I was not ready to go this way, I would have signed for Real Madrid.' Half of Roger Lemerre's squad have spent some time in the Premiership colony and most of them improved in stature from doing so. </p> <p>Scholes remains cautious of the imminent Germany confrontation: 'It will be tough. They have started afresh with a new manager, and it won't be like the Euro 2000 game. They were struggling then. They didn't look like a team who were getting on with each other. Their spirit looks a lot better now.' But so, tellingly, does England's.</p>",

Lifting his sights beyond simple extortion, an unsophisticated Filipino teenager scored seven on the Richter scale by writing a few lines of simple code that became the Love Letter virus. This romantic-sounding electronic worm triggered an epidemic of email, which swiftly crippled computing infrastructure around the planet. </p> <p>Of the 45,000 or so computer viruses in the wild, by far the great majority are crude instruments of chaos, designed to infect, corrupt and damage as many personal computers as possible. And like any chronic virus, the first symptoms of illness quickly become signs of collapse, followed in some cases by silicon death, leaving very little doubt that something is badly wrong with your PC. </p> <p>This summer, something changed in the shadowy world of The Matrix . Indeed, we may now be seeing the first real evidence of the virus 'industry' evolving beyond its adolescent, aerosol-can approach to information anarchy and instead pursuing more sinister challenges. </p> <p>The first hint of the unusual came with the arrival of the Pok\u00e9mon virus at the end of June. Unique perhaps because it is an exercise in malice focused exclusively at children. Remarkably and unlike anything else to do with the oversold Pok\u00e9mon character, the hidden worm it carries is free, a feature which acts as a magnet to young internet users. Once again, the unfortunate Microsoft Outlook address book acts as the carrier and in this case, computer animation from the mischievous but lovable Pikachu character will trash Daddy's Windows system directory. </p> <p>Following closely after the Pok\u00e9mon panic came the first designer virus aimed at a personal banking application. No need for many of us to worry quite yet, as this one was aimed at customers of the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) but it is only a matter of time before some enterprising criminal starts thinking creatively about the increasing popularity of internet banking. </p> <p>Who is liable, one asks, if a package of clandestine software, a 'Trojan', starts recording keystrokes and trawls your computer hard disk for account information? The banks are spending huge sums on protecting their own infrastructures, but the weakest point in the web still remains the customer. So can consumers reasonably protect their most confidential data? If such details as a password or perhaps even a PIN number are stolen, can they expect an online bank manager to be sympathetic? </p> <p>Most recently, the <a href=\"http://www.fipr.org\">Foundation for Information Policy Research</a> web site published a detailed analysis of the contractual and technical weaknesses associated with the many different kinds of emerging e-commerce transaction services. The report revealed that customers of some online banks face the prospect of unlimited personal liability as a consequence of fraud. Invariably, such matters are reduced to questions of negligence and the exercise of reasonable care. </p> <p>In response, the Halifax bank last week sent a wake-up call to the online banking sector, by announcing, through a deal with leading software security company, Trend Micro, that it would offer all its online customers a free anti-virus software package for their home PCs and provide free ongoing anti-virus updates. Other banks are bound to follow, or at least make reassuring noises while they assess the true scale of the risk as it emerges. </p> <p>The foundation's director, Casper Bowden, says: 'It's a worrying scenario whether banks might invoke the small print if they suffered a systemic loss due to a virus. If it's one dissatisfied customer, the bank has a customer service problem. If it's 10,000 defrauded customers, it's a question of legal liability.' </p> <p>Not so, says Jo Wright, a spokeswoman at Barclays Bank. 'Our customers will not be liable if they are victims of fraud, online or otherwise. We will investigate any claim but - should such a thing happen and a large number of customers are affected - we may have to look at each individual case'. </p> <p>The bank has posted this promise to its website and offers detailed information on how users can protect their account information. It stresses: 'Customers should always be careful when opening emails from unknown sources. This is the most likely way that this sort of fraud could be attempted.' </p> <p>This may sound like good news but banks aren't famous for their speed in resolving customers' problems. If larger numbers are involved, the process could be slow, and Barclays seemed a little vague about the small print and didn't call us back. </p> <p>Eric Chien at the Symantec Anti-Virus Research Centre, says: 'Before online banking the opportunity for fraud on this scale just wasn't there. The weakest point is still the home user's personal computer. The Halifax news is a good step forward but the responsibility lies with the banks to invest in customer confidence. People just don't trust online banking.' </p> <p>The UBS 'Trojan' virus may have been the first example of something new, but it was trivial technically. It simply illustrated how a virus writer's motive could shift from trying to win recognition towards personal gain. </p> <p>It seems that virus writers see little reward in writing code that targets popular home financial software. Invariably, these packages encrypt the data they hold, and the general architecture of Windows-based PCs makes it easier to steal information directfrom the keyboard than to unscramble professionally written software. </p> <p>In fact, a really clever virus could conceivably collect and pass on information from many thousands of PCs and, perhaps one day, even mobile phones, to another country. This in turn might be able to execute thousands of small e-commerce transactions before any action could be taken. </p> <p>Chien says: 'The only silver bullet is user education and solid content security.

But it is not that simple. Business has copyright and patent laws to encourage and reward research and development; the transfer system is football's way of investing in development of talent. If football is to be compared to a business, it needs similar protection, and not de-regulation. </p> <p>The EU wants to end big-money transfers such as those we saw this summer involving Hernan Crespo and Luis Figo. But even if transfer fees are abolished, Figo's market value would still be \u00a337 million because that is how much a club is prepared to pay for his labour. So the European Commission's plans would mean that a player's market value would end up being reflected in his wages instead of the transfer fee. Thus Figo and anyone else at world-class level could soon be earning \u00a3250,000-a-week - that's \u00a335,000 a day - which is the equivalent of \u00a337 million over three years of a contract. Top players' wages will explode. </p> <p>Any large increase in wages would further undermine the financial viability of a sport in which Deloitte &amp; Touche report that players' salaries already account for 95 per cent of the turnover of Third Division clubs and 58 per cent of the Premier League's turnover. </p> <p>Without wishing to sound alarmist, this could destroy many of the smaller clubs in England, Scotland and across Europe. These clubs rely on selling players on to bigger clubs for a fee to help keep afloat. A club like Crewe Alexandra would have their incentive to develop players such as David Platt, Neil Lennon and Ashley Ward removed at a stroke. The way these clubs have managed to stay alive, their lifeline, would disappear. Unless, of course, the EU accepts that proper compensation should be paid. </p> <p>Among the proposals agreed in Zurich by Fifa, Uefa, the Premier League and Fifpro, the international confederation of players unions, was that there must be a compensation system so that when a player under 24 moves clubs, the selling club are rewarded for the part they have played in his development. The amount would be based on the club's training programme, the value of the player's contract and his first-team and international experience. Without such a system, the EU's latest foray into sport could destroy countless clubs and jobs - footballers' jobs. People may wonder why the chief executive of the players union is arguing against a move that will make many of my members significantly richer. The answer is that, without the EU agreeing to proper compensation and the creation of an annual 'transfer window' during which players can move - then and only then - the price would be too high. There's no point creating greater freedom for professional footballers if as a result of that freedom there are fewer clubs left to employ them. </p> <p>While I understand the EU's motives in pursuing this, they have barely consulted the players, the 'workers' whose rights they are so keen to extend. If they had I would have told them that none of our 3,000 members is unhappy with the current system. The present standard contract gives players security and protection to a much greater degree than they would have under the EU's proposals. </p> <p>If this change is not thought about, planned and implemented in a sensible way, football clubs will become like Euston station, with different players arriving, staying for a short while and leaving again almost non-stop. Nobody wants that - and the EU should do everything possible to ensure that this chaos is avoided. Fans certainly do not want that. </p> <p>Concern has already been expressed by a wide range of respected voices in football, including the Uefa president, Lennart Johansson, that the increasing influx of foreign players into British football is making it harder for fans to identify with certain teams because so few British players play for them, sometimes none at all. </p> <p>The special protocol would recognise that sport was indeed different from any other business, and therefore grant it a limited exemption from European principles of free trade and free movement of labour. </p> <p>The key point is this: sport is not simply another business. Most businesses try to reduce competition through mergers and market forces; sport without competition, without 'uncertainty of result', would descend into monopoly and monotony. </p> <p>The recycling of money through football via transfer fees helps guarantee that clubs can potentially 'do a Wimbledon'. We end that trickle-down of funds at our peril. A protocol would enshrine in law sport's right to sometimes do things differently. In the view of Fifa, Uefa and the PFA, it would also let us control the influx of foreign players into our game. </p> <p>The movement of European players within the EU is unchecked because 'free movement of labour' is a sacrosanct principle. But surely there is a level beyond which 'free movement' is no longer beneficial. We could soon have a situation in football like the one in British ice hockey where there are only half-a-dozen English-born players left in the Super League; the national team suffers, obviously. While the EU encourages 'free movement of labour', it should also recognise that national and local identity are important too, especially in sport, and that a balance has to be struck between the two. </p> <p>Sport is different. Thirteen of the 15 EU member states support some sort of protocol for sport. The only two governments that do not are the Danes and our own. Although the Culture Secretary, Chris Smith, backs us, I understand that the Trade and Industry Secretary, Stephen Byers, is against a protocol, believing that it would 'open the floodgates' and that other industries would start demanding special treatment. </p> <p>Anyone who cares about the future of sport should back the campaign for a protocol.

      "body": "<p>If the transfer system is abolished in the next few weeks, as it surely will be, I imagine many managers up and down the country will be celebrating. </p> <p>You may have seen Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson protesting now that the EU has forced Fifa and Uefa to consider such a drastic proposal, but for many of us, both in and out of the game, the end of the current transfer system will be a good thing. </p> <p>What we have at the moment is archaic and ridiculous. Transfer fees are not rooted in reality, and often bear little relation to a player's true value. If you are buying a house, for example, it will be priced according to the value of the house next door. But with players it seems that fees are plucked out of the air. The system is ad-hoc and in need of a complete restructuring. </p> <p>It is typical of football that it has come to this. The situation has been on the horizon for four or five years, since the Bosman case changed the landscape as far as transfers are concerned. TS Eliot once said that mankind could not bear too much reality, and this is so true of football people, who have a terrible habit of burying their heads in the sand. </p> <p>One argument that has been going on far too long is that football should be exempt from certain laws because it is not like any other industry. Nonsense. As the EU points out, why should players be unable to move from one place of work to another because their employers have archaic and draconian controls over them? </p> <p>The first thing that will change once the ruling comes in, which I imagine will be next summer, is the nature of contracts. The standard contract will no longer apply and will be replaced by more individualistic, personalised deals which will be shorter. </p> <p>While this means players will have more freedom to move on every year or so, it also gives the manager the power to 'unload' surplus players. I would estimate most managers have at least half a dozen players on the books that they would like to get rid of, but are unable to sell. Instead, those players tend to serve out their contracts in the reserves, serving no useful purpose to the club yet still draining the financial resources. </p> <p>One manager who has just taken over at a second division club, told me last week how he was desperate to reduce his squad of 40, ridiculously large for his club. The proposed changes would mean he could get rid of ten or 15 at a stroke, thus reducing the wage bill by a huge amount and re-allocating that money among the players he wants to keep. </p> <p>In the First Division, you could lop \u00a3500,000 per year off your wage bill in this way, and in the Premiership I would estimate it to be nearer \u00a32million. That is money you could reinvest in your squad. I predict the wages of the average Premiership player rising by between 25 and 50 per cent, and slightly lower rises in the First Division. </p> <p>By contrast, I think wages will go down in the second and third divisions, where they are already too high in relation to the money generated by most clubs. I am still amazed, as are coaches from all over Europe, that there are players in the third tier of English football being paid six-figure salaries. </p> <p>Those are the exceptions, of course, but even the average salaries of \u00a330,000 to \u00a350,000 are ridiculous for clubs who rarely attract gates of more than 5,000. No other sport, nor even the British the atre, is so heavily subsidised as many of these clubs, who are kept afloat on money from sponsorship and TV deals. </p> <p>No-one wants to see the smaller clubs go to the wall, and I think the new system will mean a lot of them having to cut their cloth accordingly. I don't think it will have a disastrous effect in the First Division because there are very few major transfers between the Nationwide League and the Premiership any more.

      "bodyText": "If the transfer system is abolished in the next few weeks, as it surely will be, I imagine many managers up and down the country will be celebrating. You may have seen Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson protesting now that the EU has forced Fifa and Uefa to consider such a drastic proposal, but for many of us, both in and out of the game, the end of the current transfer system will be a good thing. What we have at the moment is archaic and ridiculous. Transfer fees are not rooted in reality, and often bear little relation to a player's true value. If you are buying a house, for example, it will be priced according to the value of the house next door. But with players it seems that fees are plucked out of the air. The system is ad-hoc and in need of a complete restructuring. It is typical of football that it has come to this. The situation has been on the horizon for four or five years, since the Bosman case changed the landscape as far as transfers are concerned. TS Eliot once said that mankind could not bear too much reality, and this is so true of football people, who have a terrible habit of burying their heads in the sand. One argument that has been going on far too long is that football should be exempt from certain laws because it is not like any other industry. Nonsense. As the EU points out, why should players be unable to move from one place of work to another because their employers have archaic and draconian controls over them? The first thing that will change once the ruling comes in, which I imagine will be next summer, is the nature of contracts. The standard contract will no longer apply and will be replaced by more individualistic, personalised deals which will be shorter. While this means players will have more freedom to move on every year or so, it also gives the manager the power to 'unload' surplus players. I would estimate most managers have at least half a dozen players on the books that they would like to get rid of, but are unable to sell. Instead, those players tend to serve out their contracts in the reserves, serving no useful purpose to the club yet still draining the financial resources. One manager who has just taken over at a second division club, told me last week how he was desperate to reduce his squad of 40, ridiculously large for his club. The proposed changes would mean he could get rid of ten or 15 at a stroke, thus reducing the wage bill by a huge amount and re-allocating that money among the players he wants to keep. In the First Division, you could lop \u00a3500,000 per year off your wage bill in this way, and in the Premiership I would estimate it to be nearer \u00a32million. That is money you could reinvest in your squad. I predict the wages of the average Premiership player rising by between 25 and 50 per cent, and slightly lower rises in the First Division. By contrast, I think wages will go down in the second and third divisions, where they are already too high in relation to the money generated by most clubs. I am still amazed, as are coaches from all over Europe, that there are players in the third tier of English football being paid six-figure salaries. Those are the exceptions, of course, but even the average salaries of \u00a330,000 to \u00a350,000 are ridiculous for clubs who rarely attract gates of more than 5,000. No other sport, nor even the British the atre, is so heavily subsidised as many of these clubs, who are kept afloat on money from sponsorship and TV deals. No-one wants to see the smaller clubs go to the wall, and I think the new system will mean a lot of them having to cut their cloth accordingly. I don't think it will have a disastrous effect in the First Division because there are very few major transfers between the Nationwide League and the Premiership any more. There are fewer and fewer clubs like Crewe Alexandra, who rely on selling two or three players a year to finance their youth academy. That is the one example where football has a genuine reason to ask to be treated as a special case, because it costs between \u00a35,000 and \u00a38,000 a year to develop a youth player, who might be whisked off to a bigger club. Obviously clubs would like to be compensated for the investment they have made, as happens here now and was shown when Aston Villa had to pay Brighton a compensation fee for young Gareth Barry. But it doesn't happen across foreign boundaries, and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is one manager who has exploited that loophole in picking up promising young players from abroad for next to nothing. While managers of the leading clubs complain that they might lose their top players, they should remember that they are also in a position to pick up replacements from their rivals or lower division clubs such as Palace - for nothing. The situation has changed enormously over the past five years, when we at Palace received around \u00a325m from the sale of our best players after being relegated. Even that sort of money did not compensate for the subsequent loss of revenue through no longer being in - or able to get back into - the Premiership. So I think the abolition of the transfer system will be good for football. Managers will have to look after their players better, clubs will need to be run better, and everyone will be more accountable, which should lead to more value for money for the most important people - the fans.",

Cheltenham's success has been due partly to the presence of their 6ft 4in centre-forward Julian Alsop, signed from Swansea in June. But even Alsop could not hold a candle to Brighton's Bobby Zamora and Nathan Jones, who scored three and two goals respectively in the 6-2 win over Torquay. Jones, who laid on Zamora's last goal, would also have had a hat-trick but for a great save by the keeper. Torquay had Jim Aggrey sent off. Bournemouth went one better (or rather worse) at Colchester, where they had two men - Danny Smith and Claus Jorgensen - shown the red card.",

      "body": "<p>FIFA has accepted that players will no longer be sold for exorbitant sums of money. Uefa have voiced their outrage, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has talked of a strike, and other reactions from Franz Beckenbauer through Bobby Charlton to Ron Noades have verged on the apocalyptic: the end of the game as we know it. In the new era scores of clubs across Britain could die, starved of transfer revenue, while top players could be earning \u00a3250,000 a week. And all thanks to the European Commission's simple but far-reaching insistence that clubs must not make a profit out of players' career movement. </p> <p>The EC decided to investigate the transfer system after Italian side Perugia complained that they should not have to pay a transfer fee for a Swiss-Italian layer, Massimo Lombardo. Fees were a restraint on trade, claimed Perugia. The EC agreed - and that means football will undergo revolutionary changes whether it likes it or not. Now that the key principle of non-profit transfers has been established by Brussels and accepted by the game's world governing body, only the details remain to be worked out. What system will replace the way things have always been done? Will compensation be payable to the club a player leaves, and if so how should that be calculated? And will the EC accept Fifa's proposal that compensation should always be paid for player aged 18-24 in recognition of the cost of training them, or will that be deemed restraint of trade too? </p> <p>Like the Bosman ruling in 1995, this latest EC bombshell on sport is based on the four basic freedoms as enshrined in the Treaty of Rome - the free movement of goods, capital, people and labour. These are sacrosanct, inviolable principles which, as football is finding out, are applied rigorously across the board. That is why the EC has now decided that transfer fees represent a restriction on the free movement of labour, on the grounds that they can stop a player joining the club of his choice. In the Eurocrats' view, footballers should not be treated any different to any other group of workers. They believe players should have the same rights as everyone else, including the ability to leave their employment after a set notice period. That is why the PFA chief executive, Gordon Taylor, warns that 'football clubs will become like Euston station', with players coming and going with dizzying frequency. </p> <p>Now that the EC has told football 'Thou shalt not profit from transfers' the game - two years after Brussels advised soccer to come up with a replacement system - is finally trying to work out what this all means and how it will cope with such traumatic change. In Zurich last Thursday Fifa, backed by the Premier League and Gordon Taylor on behalf of players' unions around Europe, suggested a new three-tier system: </p> <p> \u0095 No international transfers on players under 18; </p> <p> \u0095 Compensation to be paid for those aged 18-24 who have been developed by the selling club; </p> <p> \u0095 No transfer fees of any sort for those over 24. </p> <p>The media reported all this on Friday as what will happen. But it's not necessarily so. </p> <p>First, Uefa have objected to Fifa's plans and criticised them for throwing in the towel too quickly. Second, and much more important, the EC has not agreed to Fifa's wishes. For example, it has already said that the proposed ban on under-18 transfers is almost certainly a breach of the principle of free movement of labour. And it may also refuse to endorse the compensation plan. It doesn't happen with other 'workers', so why should footballers be treated differently? </p> <p>However, the ban on transfer fees should bring some benefits. Unscrupulous agents could well disappear and European football may at last bring in American-style rules, such as an annual draft of talent, designed to keep the sport competitive. </p> <p>Football agent Terry Parris, who represents Premiership players, believes the end of transfer fees should also mean the end of rogue agents, the unscrupulous ones who make a killing by continually moving their client from club to club, picking up a slice of signing-on fees as he goes. In one such move only a month ago, one agent asked for, and was given, \u00a31.2million simply for persuading his client to sign on the dotted line for a Premiership club. </p> <p>'Agents will have to work much harder and will no longer be able to get away with just waiting around for the next big payday. They will no longer be getting their percentage of players' moves, so they will have to become more aggressive in pursuing commercial opportunities for their clients,' says Parris. Agents will become more accountable to their players, and that's a good thing, he says. </p> <p>However, because the explosion in wages will mean many players earn as much in a week as some small businesses turn over in a year, footballers will need a far greater range of advisers. Commercial negotiators, lawyers and investment advisers will be needed. Parris predicts that, as very few people can offer all such help, agencies will take over managing players' affairs from individual agents. </p> <p>Sports lawyer Darren Bailey, managing partner of sports law specialists Townleys, says Nicolas Anelka's short-lived stay at Highbury highlights the intrinsically unfair nature of the transfer system as it has existed until now. </p> <p>'Arsenal bought him for \u00a3500,000 from Paris Saint Germain and sold him two years later for a profit of \u00a322.5 million.

      "bodyText": "FIFA has accepted that players will no longer be sold for exorbitant sums of money. Uefa have voiced their outrage, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has talked of a strike, and other reactions from Franz Beckenbauer through Bobby Charlton to Ron Noades have verged on the apocalyptic: the end of the game as we know it. In the new era scores of clubs across Britain could die, starved of transfer revenue, while top players could be earning \u00a3250,000 a week. And all thanks to the European Commission's simple but far-reaching insistence that clubs must not make a profit out of players' career movement. The EC decided to investigate the transfer system after Italian side Perugia complained that they should not have to pay a transfer fee for a Swiss-Italian layer, Massimo Lombardo. Fees were a restraint on trade, claimed Perugia. The EC agreed - and that means football will undergo revolutionary changes whether it likes it or not. Now that the key principle of non-profit transfers has been established by Brussels and accepted by the game's world governing body, only the details remain to be worked out. What system will replace the way things have always been done? Will compensation be payable to the club a player leaves, and if so how should that be calculated? And will the EC accept Fifa's proposal that compensation should always be paid for player aged 18-24 in recognition of the cost of training them, or will that be deemed restraint of trade too? Like the Bosman ruling in 1995, this latest EC bombshell on sport is based on the four basic freedoms as enshrined in the Treaty of Rome - the free movement of goods, capital, people and labour. These are sacrosanct, inviolable principles which, as football is finding out, are applied rigorously across the board. That is why the EC has now decided that transfer fees represent a restriction on the free movement of labour, on the grounds that they can stop a player joining the club of his choice. In the Eurocrats' view, footballers should not be treated any different to any other group of workers. They believe players should have the same rights as everyone else, including the ability to leave their employment after a set notice period. That is why the PFA chief executive, Gordon Taylor, warns that 'football clubs will become like Euston station', with players coming and going with dizzying frequency. Now that the EC has told football 'Thou shalt not profit from transfers' the game - two years after Brussels advised soccer to come up with a replacement system - is finally trying to work out what this all means and how it will cope with such traumatic change. In Zurich last Thursday Fifa, backed by the Premier League and Gordon Taylor on behalf of players' unions around Europe, suggested a new three-tier system: \u0095 No international transfers on players under 18; \u0095 Compensation to be paid for those aged 18-24 who have been developed by the selling club; \u0095 No transfer fees of any sort for those over 24. The media reported all this on Friday as what will happen. But it's not necessarily so. First, Uefa have objected to Fifa's plans and criticised them for throwing in the towel too quickly. Second, and much more important, the EC has not agreed to Fifa's wishes. For example, it has already said that the proposed ban on under-18 transfers is almost certainly a breach of the principle of free movement of labour. And it may also refuse to endorse the compensation plan. It doesn't happen with other 'workers', so why should footballers be treated differently? However, the ban on transfer fees should bring some benefits. Unscrupulous agents could well disappear and European football may at last bring in American-style rules, such as an annual draft of talent, designed to keep the sport competitive. Football agent Terry Parris, who represents Premiership players, believes the end of transfer fees should also mean the end of rogue agents, the unscrupulous ones who make a killing by continually moving their client from club to club, picking up a slice of signing-on fees as he goes. In one such move only a month ago, one agent asked for, and was given, \u00a31.2million simply for persuading his client to sign on the dotted line for a Premiership club. 'Agents will have to work much harder and will no longer be able to get away with just waiting around for the next big payday. They will no longer be getting their percentage of players' moves, so they will have to become more aggressive in pursuing commercial opportunities for their clients,' says Parris. Agents will become more accountable to their players, and that's a good thing, he says. However, because the explosion in wages will mean many players earn as much in a week as some small businesses turn over in a year, footballers will need a far greater range of advisers. Commercial negotiators, lawyers and investment advisers will be needed. Parris predicts that, as very few people can offer all such help, agencies will take over managing players' affairs from individual agents. Sports lawyer Darren Bailey, managing partner of sports law specialists Townleys, says Nicolas Anelka's short-lived stay at Highbury highlights the intrinsically unfair nature of the transfer system as it has existed until now. 'Arsenal bought him for \u00a3500,000 from Paris Saint Germain and sold him two years later for a profit of \u00a322.5 million. Yet PSG, who developed Anelka, got nothing,' explains Bailey. 'In future PSG would receive compensation for the first deal, and after that any money would go straight to the player.' Which, if the 'buying' club were still willing to invest as much, would be an awful lot of cash. Under whatever new system is brought in, clubs like Arsenal will have to accustom themselves to there no longer being any profit in transfers; there will be only compensation for 'research and development' - the nurturing of talent. Players under 24 might be regarded as still being 'in development' and so a fee would still be payable as a reward for their investment of time and teaching.

      "body": "<p> I am going to crash in four seconds. Momentarily, as my paraglider skirts the edge of the hill, I recall my practice emergency landings. But to do a parachute roll I need to land on my feet and I can already tell they won't be the bit that hits the ground first. Second one... I try to move my left hand to change the direction of the canopy away from the hillside but my arm, entangled in one of the brake lines, is paralysed into inac tion. Second two... the canopy skims the ground, as though I am performing some daring manoeuvre with a stunt kite. Second three... as the right edge of the canopy scrapes along the low scrub, my wing starts to crumple and deflate. Second four... impact. For a few, longer seconds there is silence and a mental and physical numbness. Then my right knee and thigh scream into life. God, that hurt. </p> <p>Several weeks before my paragliding course, family and friends began warning me about how dangerous paragliding is. Now, I will have to face those told-you-so looks. But let's keep things in perspective. Any insurance firm will advise that riding and skiing are dangerous sports too. So why is a cheap skiing holiday in the Alps virtually on the national curriculum? And why does every 12-year-old girl either take riding lessons or long to take them? </p> <p>My desire to learn to paraglide was roused several years ago. As I was crossing a field, a dark shape moved silently over me and, looking up, I saw a huge bird hovering in front of the sun. Then almost at once it turned, and I saw my mistake: it was a man hanging beneath a thin whisp of colour. Over the far end of the field he had circled, found some lift and risen until he was no bigger than a distant gull. Since that day I had wanted to be a birdman too. </p> <p>And here, on the Isle of Wight, I was getting my chance. Phil Keen, of High Adventure, the island's paragliding school, had invited me to a two-day introductory course. He met me at his base in Freshwater Bay with a dozen of his trainee pilots. Apart from me and another novice, Tim, they had already earned, if not their wings, at least a feather or two. It takes anything from 10 days to a lifetime to gain a paragliding pilot's licence - depending on your co-ordination, commitment and the vagaries of the British weather. Although not everyone who attends wants to learn to fly - Phil also caters for casual thrillseekers, including stag parties - those who complete the course usually pass in anything from eight to 15 flying days. </p> <p>The school's flying site on Compton Down, overlooking the bay, offers dramatic views of Tennyson Down, the poet's favourite haunt, and the great chalk pillars of the Needles. There are paragliding schools across Britain but beginners could do no better than learn on the island. Because the wind arriving on the down comes straight off the sea, it is undisturbed by the obstacles - houses, hedges, trees - that usually cause turbulence. </p> <p>Or rather the wind would be perfect were it not on this particular day also bringing in waves of fog. No matter, Phil says, Tim and I can practise take-offs even in low visibility. As he and the advanced party disappear into the mist, Tim and I are left with two instructors - Phil's girlfriend, Sam, and Mike, a wiry Yorkshireman who when not airborne is a guard at Albany jail. Mike opens out our canopies, revealing a complex array of lines connecting them to the harness. These lines determine the canopy's shape and angle in flight, ensure its internal pockets are filled with air, and are used to control the paraglider's direction. Mastery of them, as I will discover during my accident, when I have grown a little too confident, is essential. </p> <p>Do-it-yourself flying started in the Sixties when a few brave souls put their faith in the aerodynamics of a triangular bit of climbing frame and sail. The hangglider was not easy to master: it had a fixed wing that needed to be carefully transported and assembled, and then the weighty frame carried up a hill before a flight. Not surprising then that a young upstart was stealing the show in the Eighties. The paraglider needed no frame, could be packed into a rucksack and weighed only a few pounds. And best of all you could be airborne after just a few hours' training. Now many flying schools have abandoned hanggliding altogether. </p> <p>On fine weekends groups of paragliders can be seen crowding the skies above dozens of ridges across the country, but the sport's profile has remained at ground level. This is surprising because from the few thousand members of the British Hanggliding and Paragliding Association (BHPA) have come a crop of world champions, both male and female. According to Phil, the reason is simple: the weather. While pilots here are forced to develop finely attuned antennae to seek out the fickle thermals that offer the chance of lift to several thousand feet, the French and Italians start out at such heights, selecting an Alpine slope and pointing their canopies in the direction of a bar below. </p> <p>Once we have completed our checks, Sam tells us to prepare for take-off. It all seems a bit sudden - after all, we have been out of doors for less than an hour. But I soon realise why she is happy to let us loose. Sam calls it bunnyhopping - but, as far as I am concerned, it involves running downhill mimicking a dodo that refuses to acknowledge its evolutionary drawback. The slope is so gentle and we are so far out of the wind that even when I charge downhill at full speed I am lucky to get more than a few feet off the ground. Every time I take off, my legs still frantically pedalling mid-air for my return to earth, I have visions of Terry-Thomas in Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines . Is the fog hiding a thick layer of pigsty muck waiting to receive me, slapstick fashion, at the end of my flight? </p> <p>No one has prepared me for how exhausting learning to paraglide will be. Things are easier when you can remain aloft, but for a trainee each flight involves losing hundreds of feet of height in seconds. After landing you have to gather up the canopy and drag it to the top again. A day's training may require walking up the hill a dozen times. Do the maths and you realise why every muscle aches. </p> <p>After half a dozen practice flights, Tim and I are taken to join Phil and the others on the big slope. They have waited all morning for a chance to fly but only as we arrive does the sun finally tease the mist apart. The two of us are moved down the slope to do some advanced bunnyhopping, while the others soar impressively overhead from the ridge. After each flight we are allowed to start a little further up the hill. Finally, running from half way up the slope I realise that not only have my madly gyrating feet left the ground but that the ground is leaving me. I am actually flying - gracelessly and without control, but it is flight. Almost immediately the wind changes its mind, withdraws its lift and I am sinking. Back on earth the flight is little more than a brief and heady blur. But looking back I can see I have flown several hundred yards. </p> <p>Next comes my little accident. It is an important reminder of the seriousness of the sport. 'Don't ever forget that as soon as you get in the harness you are a pilot - you are in charge of an aircraft,' warns Phil. As though appalled by my negligence, the fog builds again and flying has to be abandoned. </p> <p>The next day the sun has triumphed. From the ridge I can see not only the valley floor 300ft below, but fields stretching to the cliffs and Tennyson Down. Phil gives me the all-clear and I pull hard on the lines forcing the canopy to rise. Briefly the canopy holds me as though I am a puppet and it a giant, unpredictable hand, but as I strain to beat the drag the wing slowly starts to move with me. I gain control and then run with all my might towards the edge of the ridge. As I reach its lip, the canopy tugs on my shoulders and takes my weight. Suddenly there is a surge of air lifting me. I am riding a thermal, taking me higher than the cliffs and the down. Hundreds of feet below, my dark outline is hurrying across the valley floor, chasing a crow startled out of the grass by the monstrous shadow over it. Finally I am the birdman. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Jonathan Cook undertook a two-day introductory paragliding course - cost \u00a3150 - with High Adventure (01983 752322).

Briefly the canopy holds me as though I am a puppet and it a giant, unpredictable hand, but as I strain to beat the drag the wing slowly starts to move with me. I gain control and then run with all my might towards the edge of the ridge. As I reach its lip, the canopy tugs on my shoulders and takes my weight. Suddenly there is a surge of air lifting me. I am riding a thermal, taking me higher than the cliffs and the down. Hundreds of feet below, my dark outline is hurrying across the valley floor, chasing a crow startled out of the grass by the monstrous shadow over it. Finally I am the birdman. \u00b7 Jonathan Cook undertook a two-day introductory paragliding course - cost \u00a3150 - with High Adventure (01983 752322).

      "body": "<p>The longer you leave it before going to Barcelona, the more likely you are to have to ponder the question: 'Was Gaud\u00ed a saint?' when you get there. </p> <p>Earlier this year, after pressure from devotees, the Vatican agreed to assess Spain's most famous architect, Antoni Gaud\u00ed i Cornet (1852-1926) for canonisation. Saints must be more than just holy - they need to enact miracles, and so the search is on for a miracle or two. So far there is little for his supporters to boast of - a man who found a job the week after his wife prayed in Gaud\u00ed's unfinished church of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is about the extent of it. </p> <p>Devotees point to his great piety and the fact that for the final 15 years of his life he devoted himself to the church, working and sleeping there, and existing only on bread and water. Some consider Gaud\u00ed's work miraculous enough. Others joke that the fact that it survived the civil war unscathed might be considered a kind of miracle. George Orwell thought the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia an abomination that the partisans should have destroyed. </p> <p>Helpfully for the pro-canonisers, the city of Barcelona has designated 2002 the year of Gaud\u00ed, though it is hard to see how Catalonia's beloved son could be given greater official or commercial prominence than he already enjoys. </p> <p>Gaud\u00ed was not always as pious or abstemious as he became in later life and, if his secular buildings are reflections of his personality, he must once have been witty, romantic and sensuous. Used to mixing with avant-garde poets, artists and musicians in his youth, Gaud\u00ed also attracted the patronage of the newly rich city merchants for whom he built what some call eccentric follies and others works of grace and genius. As he barely worked outside Barcelona, he has become identified with the city and you can see almost his entire oeuvre on foot. </p> <p>More and more of us are choosing to visit Gaudi's city: British Airways Holidays has revealed that it sends more visitors to Barcelona than to Paris, previously its top European city. If you are one of those taking a short break, you must make an early decision about time. Dividing your waking hours into one-third Gaud\u00ed, one-third eating and drinking and one-third shopping is a possible mix. But remember, if your trip includes a Sunday, shops and many restaurants are closed, making this a good day for visiting La Sagrada Fam\u00edlia and further-flung Gaud\u00ed delights such as the hilltop Parc G\u00fcell, planned as an Art Nouveau garden suburb. </p> <p>Make sure to raise your eyes from street level: We saw an unexpected facade by Gaud\u00ed's follower Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, whose famous works include the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana, among other less heralded exteriors and interiors. To our surprise, too, the rundown but clean Hotel Espa\u00f1a which we had booked by telephone, turned out to contain Dom\u00e8nech mosaics and a mural by the artist Ram\u00f3n Casa. </p> <p>A walk up the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia (which runs north-west from the Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya) combines all three activities. This is the Bond Street of Barcelona with wonderful bargains to be had at a half or a third of London prices. Here you will find, suitably interlaced with bars and coffee shops, fine Spanish shoes, accessories and superbly cut women's clothes from chains such as Adolfo Dom\u00ednguez. </p> <p>In the same street, in just one small section, between the turnings Consell de Cent and Arag\u00f3 is a string of modernist buildings by Gaud\u00ed and contemporaries. They include the Lle\u00f3 Morera mansion by Dom\u00e8nech; two buildings by Enric Sagnier; and the neo-Gothic Casa Amatller, a mansion designed by Josep Puig i Cadafalch. Next comes Gaud\u00ed's Batll\u00f3 house with mosaic fa\u00e7ade and its Disney-esque operatic balconies (which Gaud\u00ed described as a 'vision of Paradise'). Across the street, a little further up, is the famous Casa Mil\u00e0 also known as 'La Pedrera', an undulating vision of what looks as if it must be cast concrete but is in fact carved stone. </p> <p>Barcelona is a city for walking and autumn and spring are the best seasons to do that. In the evening you can promenade and pose along the Ramblas avenue as Barcelona's citizens have done for decades. On a Sunday morning you can watch the performance and mime artists, some camouflaged as stone and metal statuary. You could spend three days just taking side turnings off Las Ramblas, with its flower and sweet stalls and, sadly, caged songbirds. </p> <p>Stop for fish tapas in the market bars - half way down from Pla\u00e7a Catalunya on the right-hand side and buy cheese and small green peppers for frying to take home. </p> <p>Another foray would be through the Barri G\u00f2tic, the old Gothic quarter. Stop off here at Pla\u00e7a Reial to see one of Gaud\u00ed's first ever commissions - street lamps for the City of Barcelona. That year, 1878, Gaud\u00ed had just finished his diploma and would have been 26. The city used his design (hallmark Gaud\u00ed with ornate yet clean modern lines) but did not commission anything further. Still, what British city is today asking 26-year-old architect graduates to replace its dull street furniture? </p> <p>If, around seven or eight o'clock, you find yourself near the seaward end of the Ramblas and your English body clock is claiming dinner then it's a good time to hunt tapas. It is still far too early to sit down to serious Catalan dinner and you will get bad service or indifferent food if you try. Head for Pla\u00e7a de la Merc\u00e9, along the last left turning off Las Ramblas before the main seafront road. From here walk down the Calle Merc\u00e9. You will find the Bodega la Plata at no 28 on the right hand side. </p> <p>Last year, the Guardian nominated this tiny bar the best in Europe and they may be right. When we visited out of season, it was busy, certainly, but despite the recommendation, the clientele was still almost all local. The tiny tiled (and sawdusted) parlour can seat only about 12, while a further dozen can hover around the two-metre bar and spill into the nar row alleyway. The price of a plate of sardines (the only thing being served when we went) and a glass of wine served from one of three barrels was about \u00a32. </p> <p>Fifty yards further down the same street on the opposite side is a bar with no name where surprisingly tasty barrelled cava is even cheaper - 150 pesetas or 60p a tumbler. The bar with no name has what you may mistake for a stuffed parrot outside until it springs terrifyingly and noisily to life the minute you cross the threshold. A jamon and bread tapas here makes a decent lunch. </p> <p>For a more serious meal return to the Barri G\u00f2tic or if you are feeling adventurous cross the sea-front road and head down a spit of land called Barceloneta, the old harbour area, crammed with brightly lit and slightly expensive fish restaurants. But in the back streets, which once housed dockers, we found Can Ros, a restaurant which served wonderfully adventurous seafood dishes including arr\u00f2s negre, a delicious black (from squid ink) rice dish for around \u00a35. </p> <p>If you exhaust shopping and eating you might after all want to try the full Gaud\u00ed experience at the unfinished church of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. Even those uncertain about its child-like overblown grandiosity, find they are moved by the exquisite detail of its vaulting and animal statuary and carvings. The museum inside with good archive pictures of the beginning gives a sense, too, of Gaudi's utter excitement and total involvement with the undertaking. </p> <p>Gaud\u00ed worked on this project for 42 years, starting in 1884. At first he combined it with his most adventurous secular work. Eventually he devoted himself entirely to his church. In 1926 he was run over and killed by a tram, supposedly on his way to mass (an important detail for his canonisation hopes). So derelict and eccentric had he become that the 74-year-old architect's body was not at first recognised. </p> <p>Sainthood is a way off yet. The Vatican has a backlog of some 3,460 other candidates, including Mother Teresa. But - miraculously enough - 116 years after Gaud\u00ed first became involved, well-wishers continue to pour money into the completion of his fairy-castle creation.</p> <p><strong>Currency</strong></p> <p>261.25 pesetas to \u00a31 </p> <p><strong>Getting there</strong></p> <p>British Airways (0345 222 111) from Gatwick or Heathrow, weekend Friday-Sunday in September \u00a3176.96 plus taxes, purchased at least three days ahead.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.easyJet.com\">easyJet</a> (0870 6000 000) from Luton, weekend Friday-Sunday in September \u00a3190 but watch out for special deals.

Gaud\u00ed lavished loving attention on tiny details including those invisible to all but the angels. Orwell thought the structure 'hideous' and wished it had been bombed in the civil war. <br>Metro: Sagrada Fam\u00edlia</p> <p>Combine sightseeing with shopping on the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, north-west off the Pla\u00e7a Catalunya. Here you will find good quality clothes, shoes and leather goods, and plenty of fine pavement caf\u00e9s to rest and admire the architecture, which includes:</p> <p>Casa Batll\u00f3, Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, 43 A dramatic revamping of an apartment block that Gaud\u00ed undertook for a rich textile manufacturer, the house is still in private hands. Here, too, you can set Gaud\u00ed in his Art Nouveau context since adjacent to the Batll\u00f3 is the work of two contemporaries: Puig i Cadafalch and Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner.<br> Metro: Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia</p> <p>Casa Mil\u00e0 ('La Pedrera'), Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia,92 is Gaud\u00ed's last residential building and he would have turned this stone-clad apartment block into a cathedral given half a chance. The owner vetoed his plan for a bronze statue of the virgin with archangels on the roof so Gaud\u00ed made do with an early version of his famous spires by building chimneys capped by mosaics made with glass from cava bottles. Tours are possible most days and a shop sells high-quality Gaud\u00ed souvenirs.<br> Metro: Diagonal or Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia</p> <p>Parc G\u00fcell, Carrer Olot, is a bus or tube ride to the north-west end of the city. Take a picnic and spend a few hours in this Unesco world heritage monument.

      "bodyText": "The longer you leave it before going to Barcelona, the more likely you are to have to ponder the question: 'Was Gaud\u00ed a saint?' when you get there. Earlier this year, after pressure from devotees, the Vatican agreed to assess Spain's most famous architect, Antoni Gaud\u00ed i Cornet (1852-1926) for canonisation. Saints must be more than just holy - they need to enact miracles, and so the search is on for a miracle or two. So far there is little for his supporters to boast of - a man who found a job the week after his wife prayed in Gaud\u00ed's unfinished church of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia is about the extent of it. Devotees point to his great piety and the fact that for the final 15 years of his life he devoted himself to the church, working and sleeping there, and existing only on bread and water. Some consider Gaud\u00ed's work miraculous enough. Others joke that the fact that it survived the civil war unscathed might be considered a kind of miracle. George Orwell thought the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia an abomination that the partisans should have destroyed. Helpfully for the pro-canonisers, the city of Barcelona has designated 2002 the year of Gaud\u00ed, though it is hard to see how Catalonia's beloved son could be given greater official or commercial prominence than he already enjoys. Gaud\u00ed was not always as pious or abstemious as he became in later life and, if his secular buildings are reflections of his personality, he must once have been witty, romantic and sensuous. Used to mixing with avant-garde poets, artists and musicians in his youth, Gaud\u00ed also attracted the patronage of the newly rich city merchants for whom he built what some call eccentric follies and others works of grace and genius. As he barely worked outside Barcelona, he has become identified with the city and you can see almost his entire oeuvre on foot. More and more of us are choosing to visit Gaudi's city: British Airways Holidays has revealed that it sends more visitors to Barcelona than to Paris, previously its top European city. If you are one of those taking a short break, you must make an early decision about time. Dividing your waking hours into one-third Gaud\u00ed, one-third eating and drinking and one-third shopping is a possible mix. But remember, if your trip includes a Sunday, shops and many restaurants are closed, making this a good day for visiting La Sagrada Fam\u00edlia and further-flung Gaud\u00ed delights such as the hilltop Parc G\u00fcell, planned as an Art Nouveau garden suburb. Make sure to raise your eyes from street level: We saw an unexpected facade by Gaud\u00ed's follower Llu\u00eds Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner, whose famous works include the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana, among other less heralded exteriors and interiors. To our surprise, too, the rundown but clean Hotel Espa\u00f1a which we had booked by telephone, turned out to contain Dom\u00e8nech mosaics and a mural by the artist Ram\u00f3n Casa. A walk up the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia (which runs north-west from the Pla\u00e7a de Catalunya) combines all three activities. This is the Bond Street of Barcelona with wonderful bargains to be had at a half or a third of London prices. Here you will find, suitably interlaced with bars and coffee shops, fine Spanish shoes, accessories and superbly cut women's clothes from chains such as Adolfo Dom\u00ednguez. In the same street, in just one small section, between the turnings Consell de Cent and Arag\u00f3 is a string of modernist buildings by Gaud\u00ed and contemporaries. They include the Lle\u00f3 Morera mansion by Dom\u00e8nech; two buildings by Enric Sagnier; and the neo-Gothic Casa Amatller, a mansion designed by Josep Puig i Cadafalch. Next comes Gaud\u00ed's Batll\u00f3 house with mosaic fa\u00e7ade and its Disney-esque operatic balconies (which Gaud\u00ed described as a 'vision of Paradise'). Across the street, a little further up, is the famous Casa Mil\u00e0 also known as 'La Pedrera', an undulating vision of what looks as if it must be cast concrete but is in fact carved stone. Barcelona is a city for walking and autumn and spring are the best seasons to do that. In the evening you can promenade and pose along the Ramblas avenue as Barcelona's citizens have done for decades. On a Sunday morning you can watch the performance and mime artists, some camouflaged as stone and metal statuary. You could spend three days just taking side turnings off Las Ramblas, with its flower and sweet stalls and, sadly, caged songbirds. Stop for fish tapas in the market bars - half way down from Pla\u00e7a Catalunya on the right-hand side and buy cheese and small green peppers for frying to take home. Another foray would be through the Barri G\u00f2tic, the old Gothic quarter. Stop off here at Pla\u00e7a Reial to see one of Gaud\u00ed's first ever commissions - street lamps for the City of Barcelona. That year, 1878, Gaud\u00ed had just finished his diploma and would have been 26. The city used his design (hallmark Gaud\u00ed with ornate yet clean modern lines) but did not commission anything further. Still, what British city is today asking 26-year-old architect graduates to replace its dull street furniture? If, around seven or eight o'clock, you find yourself near the seaward end of the Ramblas and your English body clock is claiming dinner then it's a good time to hunt tapas. It is still far too early to sit down to serious Catalan dinner and you will get bad service or indifferent food if you try. Head for Pla\u00e7a de la Merc\u00e9, along the last left turning off Las Ramblas before the main seafront road. From here walk down the Calle Merc\u00e9. You will find the Bodega la Plata at no 28 on the right hand side. Last year, the Guardian nominated this tiny bar the best in Europe and they may be right. When we visited out of season, it was busy, certainly, but despite the recommendation, the clientele was still almost all local. The tiny tiled (and sawdusted) parlour can seat only about 12, while a further dozen can hover around the two-metre bar and spill into the nar row alleyway. The price of a plate of sardines (the only thing being served when we went) and a glass of wine served from one of three barrels was about \u00a32. Fifty yards further down the same street on the opposite side is a bar with no name where surprisingly tasty barrelled cava is even cheaper - 150 pesetas or 60p a tumbler. The bar with no name has what you may mistake for a stuffed parrot outside until it springs terrifyingly and noisily to life the minute you cross the threshold. A jamon and bread tapas here makes a decent lunch. For a more serious meal return to the Barri G\u00f2tic or if you are feeling adventurous cross the sea-front road and head down a spit of land called Barceloneta, the old harbour area, crammed with brightly lit and slightly expensive fish restaurants. But in the back streets, which once housed dockers, we found Can Ros, a restaurant which served wonderfully adventurous seafood dishes including arr\u00f2s negre, a delicious black (from squid ink) rice dish for around \u00a35. If you exhaust shopping and eating you might after all want to try the full Gaud\u00ed experience at the unfinished church of the Sagrada Fam\u00edlia. Even those uncertain about its child-like overblown grandiosity, find they are moved by the exquisite detail of its vaulting and animal statuary and carvings. The museum inside with good archive pictures of the beginning gives a sense, too, of Gaudi's utter excitement and total involvement with the undertaking. Gaud\u00ed worked on this project for 42 years, starting in 1884. At first he combined it with his most adventurous secular work. Eventually he devoted himself entirely to his church. In 1926 he was run over and killed by a tram, supposedly on his way to mass (an important detail for his canonisation hopes). So derelict and eccentric had he become that the 74-year-old architect's body was not at first recognised. Sainthood is a way off yet. The Vatican has a backlog of some 3,460 other candidates, including Mother Teresa. But - miraculously enough - 116 years after Gaud\u00ed first became involved, well-wishers continue to pour money into the completion of his fairy-castle creation.

Gaud\u00ed lavished loving attention on tiny details including those invisible to all but the angels. Orwell thought the structure 'hideous' and wished it had been bombed in the civil war. Metro: Sagrada Fam\u00edlia Combine sightseeing with shopping on the Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, north-west off the Pla\u00e7a Catalunya. Here you will find good quality clothes, shoes and leather goods, and plenty of fine pavement caf\u00e9s to rest and admire the architecture, which includes: Casa Batll\u00f3, Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia, 43 A dramatic revamping of an apartment block that Gaud\u00ed undertook for a rich textile manufacturer, the house is still in private hands. Here, too, you can set Gaud\u00ed in his Art Nouveau context since adjacent to the Batll\u00f3 is the work of two contemporaries: Puig i Cadafalch and Dom\u00e8nech i Montaner. Metro: Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia Casa Mil\u00e0 ('La Pedrera'), Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia,92 is Gaud\u00ed's last residential building and he would have turned this stone-clad apartment block into a cathedral given half a chance. The owner vetoed his plan for a bronze statue of the virgin with archangels on the roof so Gaud\u00ed made do with an early version of his famous spires by building chimneys capped by mosaics made with glass from cava bottles. Tours are possible most days and a shop sells high-quality Gaud\u00ed souvenirs. Metro: Diagonal or Passeig de Gr\u00e0cia Parc G\u00fcell, Carrer Olot, is a bus or tube ride to the north-west end of the city. Take a picnic and spend a few hours in this Unesco world heritage monument. The park was intended to be a kind of garden suburb for 60 very wealthy citizens, but only two houses and a fine caretaker's entrance to the park were ever built. Metro: Vallcarca.

I had gone on deck hoping to hear the pororoca - a collision between river and ocean triggered by the full moon and likened to the crash of siege guns - but our skipper, mindful of his 1,460 sleeping passengers, steered clear. Moving dead slow we made our 15-mile transit of the bar with only a metre between sea bed and keel. </p> <p>Every eight hours a million tons of silt are dumped on the bar, every 50 days the Amazon discharges enough to form an adobe Everest as wide as it is high. The bar, therefore, remains in a state of constant agitation. I waited for the bump and shudder that would signify we had touched bottom, yet the largest liner ever to enter the world's greatest river finally heaved her 63,534-ton bulk across and picked up speed. </p> <p>The mouth is 170 miles wide and, though a procession of big trees - mahogany, araucaria, various exotic hardwoods - came wallowing past, toppled by erosion, it was mid-morning before we saw smudges of land. Meanwhile the ship settled into its routine: a clinic taken by the onboard chiropodist, golf chipping in the nets, choc-ices being sold on the sun deck. Then came a bridge announcement: 'At 3pm, after boarding our pilots, we shall cross the Equator.' A woman pointed to an opaline butterfly with the wingspan of a swallow. 'We really are in the tropics!' I noted we also now seemed to be in a river - though the banks remained so far apart they seemed like the shores of different continents. </p> <p>Over an excellent Goan fish curry lunch I tried to imagine the incredulity felt by Francisco de Orellana, a one-eyed Portuguese who, on a Sunday morning in 1542, went searching for cinnamon in a small wooden boat. Emerging from a tributary 2,000 miles upstream, he and his men encountered a phenomenon which 'came on with such fury and with so great an onrush that it was enough to fill one with the greatest fear'. They emerged from the mouth seven months later telling tales of female warriors even more barbarous than the mastectomised man-killers of Asia Minor. The Amazon was thus named after a Greek myth compounded by Orellana's own feverish imagination. </p> <p>I recalled some pub-quiz facts. The Amazon and its 1,000 tributaries carry a fifth of all the world's fresh water - 10 carry more than the Mississippi - produce one-fifth of its oxygen, sustain 30 per cent of its forests and one-tenth of its plant and animal species (though each category, bar the first, is diminishing by the hour). </p> <p>At Santana, a large, leafy town with a scattering of high-rise buildings, we anchored a full mile offshore to collect our officials. A purser spoke of the rapacious Rebelli brothers. 'They were the first Amazon pilots to realise the kind of money they could make from tourism. \"Pay up or this ship doesn't move!\" Even today the skipper has to hand over $55,000 in cash. And now the authorities want 60 per cent of the takings of our shops - and a big cut of our bar profits. If it goes on like this we may stop coming altogether.' </p> <p>Only a handful of liners visit the Amazon anyway. It's so far off the beaten track that P&amp;O, selling around 100 cruises annually, does this only once. A circular from the Tours Office said: 'As one of the last frontiers in the world, life in Amazonia is very different to life as we know it in Europe.' It warned of bad roads, poor transport, inadequate guides and 'varying degrees of poverty'. </p> <p>Yet ships have travelled it for 150 years. Clipper-bowed and brig-rigged, built from live oak, locust wood and hackamack (double-planked and strapped with iron) they later gilded their paddle-boxes and added social refinements: string quartets, champagne bars, and chandeliers that twinkled along the Amazon. </p> <p>It descends in a series of sweeping parabolic curves, the force of water around the outer rims scouring channels so deep we swept along at oceanic speeds ('17 knots over the ground,' reported a gratified officer of the watch). At times one bank remained a whisp on the skyline as Arcadia, hugging the other, put us within yards of macaws and troupials, blizzards of white egrets, orchids half-smothered by strangler vines, blossom-decked trees taller than Nelson's Column, tiny whey-faced monkeys scampering through a banyan's canopy. Someone even heard a whippoorwill's call. </p> <p>Leafage thick as thatch neutralised sunlight, made the forest's interior dim and smoky. At dusk a few clearings appeared - each containing a shack where rubber tappers or distillers of rosewood sat by their supper fires. Peering with voyeuristic intensity at them I wondered what they made of us - shining white, 14 decks high, humming with privilege - and was tickled to note most barely even glanced up; we were of less interest than a passing canoe. </p> <p>Santar\u00e9m lies on a tributary 15 miles wide and shallow as a pond. Though it possesses a university and a pretty little eighteenth century cathedral it is, in reality, just a toe-hold in a wilderness that reaches all the way to the Mato Grosso. Empty streets and a sense of isolation characterised Santar\u00e9m on a Sunday morning. But, magically, it soon repopulated itself. Whores in hot pants turned up at the dock, transport materialised. A stout Geordie woman hailed a taxi with a cry of: 'Take me to the jungle, pet!' The rest soon scrambled into coaches and followed. Its proximity had helped sell every berth on Arcadia six months earlier. </p> <p>Joe distributed walking sticks. Young, black, intense, he warned: 'Once inside always look before you touch; there are flowers that can poison you, and trees with nee dles that will send you to hospital. Last night we had heavy rain; it is very slippery.' </p> <p>The dozen trudging after him into Amazonia's Green Hell included a used-car dealer, a retired judge and a couple who ran a Bristol off-licence. This dim, airless world with its unexpected sound-effects - exploding rubber pods scattering their seeds - proved to be a giant life-support system. In proper virgin bush, just two acres may contain 3,000 botanical species yet, even here along well-trodden tourist tracks, we saw scores of edible fruits, nuts and leaves, pods which made cashew-flavoured beer, bushes yielding nourishing worms, trees providing sweet water. By a brackish creek we learnt that eight times as many types of fish have been caught in a tiny Amazonian lakelet than in all the rivers of Europe. </p> <p>Building materials lay to hand: palms like the accashy made good thatch, the caranda strong walls. Swatting at stingless, sweat-drinking bees we noted plants used against malaria and depression, learnt that the forest Indians had identified at least 15 female oral contraceptives, that shrubs containing revolutionary anti-Aids or cancer compounds might be growing only yards away. 'Or maybe not,' said Joe. 'Maybe the last such plants were burnt yesterday.' </p> <p>In 1996 developers burnt a region the size of Belgium - now the Amazon smoke cloud has reached Antarctica. Since Chico Mendez was shot dead for creating his protected reservas extrativistas, hundreds of other protesters have also been murdered. 'In Manaus you will see the timber factories. And if, one day, you hear they have been fire-bombed, remember - it was me.' Gilberto Mestrinho, a governor of Amazonas state, believed in 'a chain saw for every family'. Responsible for flattening a million square miles of rainforest during three terms in office, he declared: 'I like trees, but they are not indispensable.' </p> <p>One afternoon, anxious to get the measure of the river, I visited the bridge to meet Lu\u00eds, our scholarly pilot. He said: 'It changes quickly. One day you pass an island that has been there for 10 years, next day it has gone. So you must keep your hand in; if I am away one month I lose my confidence. Often I still use the old methods - lining up two trees, following ripples and drifting vegetation; these mean depth. This way I could take Arcadia all the way to Iquitos in Peru, 2,200 miles from the sea; a smaller ship I could get quite close to the Andes; the source is there, in a glacier.' An officer muttered: 'I'm doing a fix every three minutes but, according to the charts, we're running over dry land.' Lu\u00eds winked at me. 'You see? It is playing with us!' </p> <p>Moments later the air grew dark. Every oxygen atom in an oxygen-rich atmosphere went critical and spontaneously liquefied, heavy water thundered down and made the water foam. We moved in a dense black wall, dead slow, siren blaring. Lu\u00eds said: 'Our problem is the country boats, they always go fast. The crews are so ignorant! There is no money for education in Amazonas.' The reappearance of the sun provoked a surprise announcement on the bridge PA. 'Ladies and gentlemen, if you look for'ard you'll see we're about to sail smack through the middle of a rainbow.' Lu\u00eds grinned. 'This river! She can be a real old drama queen.' </p> <p>Boca do Valerio is an Indian hamlet of a dozen houses - on stilts to offset flooding - overlooking a marsh. As Arcadia's invasion force trampled its territory and walked through its homes, some of the 80 inhabitants posed in cloaks of iridescent feathers for a dollar a shot. Others peddled crude souvenirs; an Essex man looking for shrunken heads (miniaturised, he said, by removing the skull then packing the skin with hot sand) got a few wry smiles from the Indians. P&amp;O's printed Port Guide said we might haggle ('Bartering is possible') and I watched an Old Etonian banker doggedly knock a dollar off a wooden bird carved by an illiterate slash-and-burn peasant. In the end the peasants always gave in. Indeed, part of the charm of the transactions lay in the fatalism of the traders; ultimately you could almost name your price. </p> <p>Back aboard I wondered what a tiny riverine community would do with the small fortune it had acquired that morning. A steward pointed to a satellite dish half-hidden in the trees. 'Last time I was here they were watching Leeds versus Man United.' He added: 'But it's causing tensions ashore, the chief has even asked us to stop other communities getting in on the act. And there are, uh, cultural implications. Have you seen what's going on aft?' Tiny mahogany canoes, carved with adzes, clustered beneath the stern. Women, some suckling babies, gazed up as female crew tossed down lipsticks, mascara, eye shadow, blusher and nail varnish. 'It's a sisters thing,' a uniformed girl told me crisply. </p> <p>Some day the Indians might even get Jos\u00e9 Carreras to sing for them. The one million he got for an evening at Manaus's neo-classical opera house was probably partly compensation for having to perform in a grubby, chronically disorganised city with a chemical edge to its ozone and some of the worst slums in Brazil. Arcadia, inbound, passed the tributarial line along which the inky Rio Negro meets - but does not mix - with the mustard-coloured Rio Solimoes. Pink dolphins may be seen here, even manatees (which Columbus mistook for mermaids). Beyond the floating ice factory lay the giant floating dock, built by a Scot in 1902 and able to adjust, seasonally, to 46ft of fluctuating levels. </p> <p>Yet Manaus offered access to the igarapes , an intimate neighbourhood of creeks, bayous and half-submerged woodlands. Here, over a drink at a waterside hotel, a retired teacher told me about Amazonia's problems - the huge areas to be flooded for hydro-electric schemes, the human suffering caused by the wildcat garimpeiros who used mercury to prospect for riverine gold, the heavy-lift Russian helicopters soon to start plucking trees from areas previously protected by their remoteness. Only half joking, he said: 'In 100 years, much of our rainforest may be turned into golf courses.' </p> <p>As Arcadia headed back to the Caribbean, many of her passengers - golfers included - had been turned into ardent rainforest activists.</p> <p><strong>What it costs </strong></p> <p>Alexander Frater was a guest of P&amp;O Cruises on board Arcadia on the 15-night Amazon and Caribbean cruise.

      "body": "<p><strong>All dressed up with nowhere to go</strong></p> <p>It's taken 31 years, and it's not yet certain, but there's no planned party for an England victory.</p> <p>Tonight, with a lot of luck, England's heroes will be celebrating their biggest victory in a generation. For the first time in that period they will have beaten the Windies - weather permitting. If the weather fouls up, the last rites may have to wait until Monday.</p> <p>Senior staff at the stylish Conrad International Hotel, where England are staying for the first time, confirm that, in line with cricketers' superstitions, no plans have been laid for a victory party. However, in various interviews this summer, Nasser Hussain and others have said that when the final Test's over they will have the party of, well, the new century.</p> <p>Quite what form the party will takes is unclear. Barring unforeseen events, England will be celebrating their biggest moment, really, in 31 years, tomorrow night or Monday night. This season a new tradition began. When the team wins, as they now have three times this summer in Tests, they gather for drinks in the hotel bar, then go for a private dinner. They then disperse for further celebrations, again very discreet, often in their hotel rooms. Of course, when the mood takes them, they go public. As Nasser put it after the Headingley win, he was up till 3am after that extraordinary conclusive second day's play, getting drunk with Derek Pringle and others and \"talking rubbish\" in the hotel bar.</p> <p>Probable scenario: England win the match sometime late today or more likely tomorrow. After the presentations the players return to the Conrad International, have a shower, chill out and go to the bar. There then follows at least an hour of celebration worthy of even the jolliest figures of past years, such as Botham, Willis, Gower and Lamb. On Friday night, team members were conspicuously absent from the hotel bar. Which shows that our present heroes have learnt from the exuberance of their childhood idols. On Friday, Darren Gough was just about the only player to appear in the bar at the Conrad and only for half an hour, and only very soberly.</p> <p>Under the new regime, the players can then be expected to go into a private dinner - a sort of huddle involving just the 12 men and the five or so management staff also staying at the rather plush Conrad - thereafter they're free to do what they like. And don't they deserve it?</p> <p>England's stars cannot complain about the standard of their accommodation for London Tests. They normally stay at the Marriott in Swiss Cottage, just up the road from Lord's. This year, they are billeted at the Conrad in Chelsea Harbour, 15 minutes' drive from The Oval, with superb views of the Thames and other attractions. Not that the players have views of those delights: each has been assigned an extensive suite comprising sitting room, double bedroom, bathroom and hall, plus televisions in both sitting room and bedroom for catching up with the highlights; for some reason, though, they are denied river views. Standard rate is \u00a3320, but the ECB routinely negotiates corporate discounts of at least 40 per cent. </p> <p>According to hotel management, no players have their wives or girlfriends with them. \"They've been most civilised guests,\" said one senior manager. \"There've been a few special requests, but nothing unusual. They do very normal things. They breakfast in their rooms - and, don't forget, most of their rooms are on different floors. That gives these guys space to relax.\"</p> <p>Naturally, the hotel is chuffed to bits with its newest clients. As Nurcan Aydogan, the 27-year-old Turkish-born duty manager, who's never seen a cricket match in her life, put it last night, \"We're thrilled that our national heroes are staying here this weekend. We like to think that the environment we've worked so hard to create since 1990 may have had just a little bit to do with their stunning performance.\" </p> <p><strong>Why Barry Richards suddenly rematerialised on C4</strong></p> <p>Viewers watching Channel 4's coverage of Saturday's extraordinary events - England's performance seemed to put the whole television team \"on fire\" - may have been surprised to see Barry Richards back in action. The great former South African opener was booked to fly home to Australia three weeks ago but events have sort of moved on.</p> <p>Ian Smith, the former New Zealand wicketkeeper, flew in for the Headingley game to take up a long-standing contractual arrangement with C4, replacing Richards, who was \"disappointed\" to be given an early bath. Smith was not expected to feature this summer - having done an excellent job during last summer's New Zealand series - but was suddenly called up after the inevitable resignation of Wasim Akram, following the damning Qayyum report verdict into his alleged match-fixing activities. As a result, Wasim felt obliged to quit - under severe pressure from his TV bosses - as a C4 commentator for this summer's Windies Tests and the one-day series.</p> <p>Why has Richards B. suddenly reappeared?

      "bodyText": "All dressed up with nowhere to go It's taken 31 years, and it's not yet certain, but there's no planned party for an England victory. Tonight, with a lot of luck, England's heroes will be celebrating their biggest victory in a generation. For the first time in that period they will have beaten the Windies - weather permitting. If the weather fouls up, the last rites may have to wait until Monday. Senior staff at the stylish Conrad International Hotel, where England are staying for the first time, confirm that, in line with cricketers' superstitions, no plans have been laid for a victory party. However, in various interviews this summer, Nasser Hussain and others have said that when the final Test's over they will have the party of, well, the new century. Quite what form the party will takes is unclear. Barring unforeseen events, England will be celebrating their biggest moment, really, in 31 years, tomorrow night or Monday night. This season a new tradition began. When the team wins, as they now have three times this summer in Tests, they gather for drinks in the hotel bar, then go for a private dinner. They then disperse for further celebrations, again very discreet, often in their hotel rooms. Of course, when the mood takes them, they go public. As Nasser put it after the Headingley win, he was up till 3am after that extraordinary conclusive second day's play, getting drunk with Derek Pringle and others and \"talking rubbish\" in the hotel bar. Probable scenario: England win the match sometime late today or more likely tomorrow. After the presentations the players return to the Conrad International, have a shower, chill out and go to the bar. There then follows at least an hour of celebration worthy of even the jolliest figures of past years, such as Botham, Willis, Gower and Lamb. On Friday night, team members were conspicuously absent from the hotel bar. Which shows that our present heroes have learnt from the exuberance of their childhood idols. On Friday, Darren Gough was just about the only player to appear in the bar at the Conrad and only for half an hour, and only very soberly. Under the new regime, the players can then be expected to go into a private dinner - a sort of huddle involving just the 12 men and the five or so management staff also staying at the rather plush Conrad - thereafter they're free to do what they like. And don't they deserve it? England's stars cannot complain about the standard of their accommodation for London Tests. They normally stay at the Marriott in Swiss Cottage, just up the road from Lord's. This year, they are billeted at the Conrad in Chelsea Harbour, 15 minutes' drive from The Oval, with superb views of the Thames and other attractions. Not that the players have views of those delights: each has been assigned an extensive suite comprising sitting room, double bedroom, bathroom and hall, plus televisions in both sitting room and bedroom for catching up with the highlights; for some reason, though, they are denied river views. Standard rate is \u00a3320, but the ECB routinely negotiates corporate discounts of at least 40 per cent. According to hotel management, no players have their wives or girlfriends with them. \"They've been most civilised guests,\" said one senior manager. \"There've been a few special requests, but nothing unusual. They do very normal things. They breakfast in their rooms - and, don't forget, most of their rooms are on different floors. That gives these guys space to relax.\" Naturally, the hotel is chuffed to bits with its newest clients. As Nurcan Aydogan, the 27-year-old Turkish-born duty manager, who's never seen a cricket match in her life, put it last night, \"We're thrilled that our national heroes are staying here this weekend. We like to think that the environment we've worked so hard to create since 1990 may have had just a little bit to do with their stunning performance.\" Why Barry Richards suddenly rematerialised on C4 Viewers watching Channel 4's coverage of Saturday's extraordinary events - England's performance seemed to put the whole television team \"on fire\" - may have been surprised to see Barry Richards back in action. The great former South African opener was booked to fly home to Australia three weeks ago but events have sort of moved on. Ian Smith, the former New Zealand wicketkeeper, flew in for the Headingley game to take up a long-standing contractual arrangement with C4, replacing Richards, who was \"disappointed\" to be given an early bath. Smith was not expected to feature this summer - having done an excellent job during last summer's New Zealand series - but was suddenly called up after the inevitable resignation of Wasim Akram, following the damning Qayyum report verdict into his alleged match-fixing activities. As a result, Wasim felt obliged to quit - under severe pressure from his TV bosses - as a C4 commentator for this summer's Windies Tests and the one-day series. Why has Richards B. suddenly reappeared? Having done a superb job in the two Zimbabwe Tests - for which he was long-contracted - and having filled in for Wasim for the first three West Indies Tests, Richards was supposed to fly home mid-August. That was where Smith came in again. But, this Test, Richards has suddenly reappeared on screen. A fellow commentator explains: \"Michael Slater [the Australian opener] suddenly had to fly back for a New South Wales training camp. That meant he had to miss this Test. Barry was our obvious choice as a replacement.

There's some evidence that the battling Rosie Boycott is shifting the daily profile to readers aged between 34 and 64, with some gains there and a slight drop in the over 65s. But that's still 28 per cent of the readership - only a point less than the Telegraph , and double the Guardian/Times/Independen t norm.

Last week the US Census Bureau issued figures showing that non-hispanic whites made up 49.8 per cent of the population of California.</p> <p>Anglo-Saxon whites are already a minority in Hawaii and the District of Columbia. Now they are an ethnic minority in the country's most populous state, the one most usually identified with the American dream.</p> <p>'It's my hope we can all see our state's diversity as a cause for celebration and not consternation,' said California's lieutenant governor, Cruz Bustamente, a Latino. Robert Newby, a white shop-owner who has lived in Los Angeles for 40 years, echoed his optimism: 'This confirms what most of us have thought for years. I am happy for there to be more immigrants - by and large they work harder and have more money to spend.'</p> <p>As recently as 1970, eight out of 10 Californians were white. Fuelled by immigration at its highest rate since the start of the last century, and higher fertility rates, the Asian and Latino populations of California have risen by almost a third since 1990. At the same time, with limited immigration and low birth rates, the population of non-hispanic whites has fallen by 3 per cent. By 2040, hispanics are expected to be the overall majority in the state.</p> <p>Where California goes, the rest of America is predicted to follow. At present 72 per cent of the US population is non-hispanic whites; the US Census Bureau predicts they will become a minority between 2055 and 2060.</p> <p>Not every one likes the new face of America. White far-right extremists predict the break-up of the union. Thomas W. Chittum, a New Jersey-based Vietnam War veteran, declared in his book Civil War Two, that the US, like Yugoslavia, will shatter into new, ethnically-based nations. 'America was born in blood, America suckled on blood, America gorged on blood and grew into a giant, and America will drown in blood,' Chittum warned.</p> <p>The separatists have set up groups such as Americans for Self-Determination. One of the founders, Jeff Anderson, said: 'We are suggesting the US be partitioned into states for blacks, whites, hispanics, and so on, along with multi-racial states for those who wish to continue with this experiment. Now is the time to begin such a multi-racial dialogue about separatism, before a storm of violent racial conflict erupts.'</p> <p>The shifting sands of the US reflect wider - and highly controversial - changes elsewhere in the world. It is an area in which few demographers dare to tread for fear of being accused of racism. 'You cannot quote me - a word out of place and I get crapped on from a very great height,' said one academic. 'Whatever you say you are deemed racist'.</p> <p>The past millennium was more than anything the era of the whites. Just 500 years ago, few had ventured outside their European homeland. Then, with several acts of genocide clearing the way, they settled in North America, South America, Australia, New Zealand and, to a lesser extent, southern Africa.</p> <p>But now, around the world, whites are falling as a proportion of population. The United Nations collects and produces a vast array of statistics on population, but produces none relating to race or ethnic origin. Indeed few countries collect their own figures on ethnicity - in Europe, only the UK and the Netherlands do.</p> <p>However, the UN's State of the World Population 1999 predicted that 98 per cent of the growth in the world's population by 2025 will occur in lesser developed regions, principally Africa and Asia. The most significant reason for this is lower birth rates in rich countries: in 61 countries, mainly the rich ones, people are no longer having enough babies to replace themselves.</p> <p>In its World Population Profile 1998, the US Census Bureau predicted that by the second decade of this century all the net gain in world population will be in developing countries. 'The future of human population growth has been determined, and is being determined, in the world's poorer nations,' it said.</p> <p>The global centre of gravity is changing. In 1900 Europe had a quarter of the world's population, and three times that of Africa; by 2050 Europe is predicted to have just 7 per cent of the world population, and a third that of Africa. The ageing and declining populations of predominantly white nations have prompted forecasts of - and calls for - more immigration from the young and growing populations of developing nations to make up the shortfall.</p> <p>Last year net immigration to Britain reached 185,000, an all-time record. The Immigration Minister, Barbara Roche, recently announced plans to attract migrants to fill specific skills shortages, such as in the computer industry.</p> <p>Last month Edmund Stoiber, the premier of Bavaria in southern Germany, called on Germans to have more babies as an alternative to more immigrants. 'We are having too few children - to a worrying degree, the significance of which is scarcely recognised,' he said. His calls echoed those of a fellow Christian Democrat who earlier this year stood on a platform of 'Children not Indians'.</p> <p>In Britain the number of ethnic minority citizens has risen from a few tens of thousands in the 1950s, to more than 3 million - or around 6 per cent of the total population. While the number of whites is virtually static, higher fertility and net immigration means the number from ethnic minorities is growing by 2 to 3 per cent a year.</p> <p>One demographer, who didn't want to be named for fear of being called racist, said: 'It's a matter of pure arithmetic that, if nothing else happens, non-Euro peans will become a majority and whites a minority in the UK. That would probably be the first time an indigenous population has voluntarily become a minority in its historic homeland.'</p> <p>Lee Jasper, race relations adviser to the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, predicted a similar future, telling The Observer : 'Where America goes, Europe follows 30 years later. There is a potential for whites to become a minority in some European countries.'</p> <p>In Britain, that is almost certain to happen in London, and in the relatively near future. 'At the moment ethnic minorities are about 40 per cent in London. The demographics show that white people in London will become a minority by 2010,' said Jasper. 'We could have a majority black Britain by the turn of the century.'</p> <p>British National Party chairman Nick Griffin said: 'I don't think there's any doubt that within this century, white people will be a minority in every country in the world.' For Griffin, however, it is a major cause of alarm: 'Every people under the sun have a right to their place under the sun, and the right to survive. If people predicted that Indians would be a minority in India in 2100, everyone would be calling it genocide.'</p> <p>Yasmin Alibhai-Brown of the Foreign Policy Centre, who arrived in London from Uganda in 1972, said such fears are basically racist: 'Only white people worry about this. It's because for such a long time the world has been their own. To talk about it feeds a particular type of racism that says that blacks breed like rabbits. There is an underlying assumption that says white is right.'</p> <p>She added: 'There is a white panic every time one part of their world seems to be passing over to anyone else. But it's foolish to panic about it. So what if we do become a majority? What difference does it make?'</p> <p>For Alibhai-Brown, the decline of whites is a question of redressing the balance after they colonised much of the world. 'The empire strikes back really. There was this extraordinary assumption that white people could go and destroy peoples and it would have no consequence. It astounds me,' she said.</p> <p>But present trends have little chance of redressing the injustices of history. Native Americans used to have the lands to themselves but are now less than 1 per cent of the US population, with little chance of becoming a majority again. The biggest growth is among Latinos (largely derived from Spain), and Asians, particularly from China and the Phillippines.</p> <p>Jasper said the concerns of the British National Party are based on outdated ideas. 'The racial mix of nations changes all the time. There is no way that ethnicity of blood can be tied to a specific geographic place in a global world. You can no longer look at ethnic states, saying that Germany is Anglo-Saxon and so on.'</p> <p>Jasper felt the process would strengthen Britain. 'Diversity strengthens a country. It makes it more exciting. We have hundreds of languages spoken, when we go out to eat we never eat English, we eat Thai or French or Indian. It makes London a very cool place to live and work.'</p> <p>Nor does it seem likely that whites will become marginalised in terms of influences, even if their numbers decline. David Owen, of the Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations at Warwick Univer sity, said: 'Population has never been the main determinant of influence - it's wealth and income.

      "bodyText": "It was news and no news; the most significant milestone in one of the most profound changes to affect the US in the past century, and yet a non-event. Last week the US Census Bureau issued figures showing that non-hispanic whites made up 49.8 per cent of the population of California. Anglo-Saxon whites are already a minority in Hawaii and the District of Columbia. Now they are an ethnic minority in the country's most populous state, the one most usually identified with the American dream. 'It's my hope we can all see our state's diversity as a cause for celebration and not consternation,' said California's lieutenant governor, Cruz Bustamente, a Latino. Robert Newby, a white shop-owner who has lived in Los Angeles for 40 years, echoed his optimism: 'This confirms what most of us have thought for years. I am happy for there to be more immigrants - by and large they work harder and have more money to spend.' As recently as 1970, eight out of 10 Californians were white. Fuelled by immigration at its highest rate since the start of the last century, and higher fertility rates, the Asian and Latino populations of California have risen by almost a third since 1990. At the same time, with limited immigration and low birth rates, the population of non-hispanic whites has fallen by 3 per cent. By 2040, hispanics are expected to be the overall majority in the state. Where California goes, the rest of America is predicted to follow. At present 72 per cent of the US population is non-hispanic whites; the US Census Bureau predicts they will become a minority between 2055 and 2060. Not every one likes the new face of America. White far-right extremists predict the break-up of the union. Thomas W. Chittum, a New Jersey-based Vietnam War veteran, declared in his book Civil War Two, that the US, like Yugoslavia, will shatter into new, ethnically-based nations. 'America was born in blood, America suckled on blood, America gorged on blood and grew into a giant, and America will drown in blood,' Chittum warned. The separatists have set up groups such as Americans for Self-Determination. One of the founders, Jeff Anderson, said: 'We are suggesting the US be partitioned into states for blacks, whites, hispanics, and so on, along with multi-racial states for those who wish to continue with this experiment. Now is the time to begin such a multi-racial dialogue about separatism, before a storm of violent racial conflict erupts.' The shifting sands of the US reflect wider - and highly controversial - changes elsewhere in the world. It is an area in which few demographers dare to tread for fear of being accused of racism. 'You cannot quote me - a word out of place and I get crapped on from a very great height,' said one academic. 'Whatever you say you are deemed racist'. The past millennium was more than anything the era of the whites. Just 500 years ago, few had ventured outside their European homeland. Then, with several acts of genocide clearing the way, they settled in North America, South America, Australia, New Zealand and, to a lesser extent, southern Africa. But now, around the world, whites are falling as a proportion of population. The United Nations collects and produces a vast array of statistics on population, but produces none relating to race or ethnic origin. Indeed few countries collect their own figures on ethnicity - in Europe, only the UK and the Netherlands do. However, the UN's State of the World Population 1999 predicted that 98 per cent of the growth in the world's population by 2025 will occur in lesser developed regions, principally Africa and Asia. The most significant reason for this is lower birth rates in rich countries: in 61 countries, mainly the rich ones, people are no longer having enough babies to replace themselves. In its World Population Profile 1998, the US Census Bureau predicted that by the second decade of this century all the net gain in world population will be in developing countries. 'The future of human population growth has been determined, and is being determined, in the world's poorer nations,' it said. The global centre of gravity is changing. In 1900 Europe had a quarter of the world's population, and three times that of Africa; by 2050 Europe is predicted to have just 7 per cent of the world population, and a third that of Africa. The ageing and declining populations of predominantly white nations have prompted forecasts of - and calls for - more immigration from the young and growing populations of developing nations to make up the shortfall. Last year net immigration to Britain reached 185,000, an all-time record. The Immigration Minister, Barbara Roche, recently announced plans to attract migrants to fill specific skills shortages, such as in the computer industry. Last month Edmund Stoiber, the premier of Bavaria in southern Germany, called on Germans to have more babies as an alternative to more immigrants. 'We are having too few children - to a worrying degree, the significance of which is scarcely recognised,' he said. His calls echoed those of a fellow Christian Democrat who earlier this year stood on a platform of 'Children not Indians'. In Britain the number of ethnic minority citizens has risen from a few tens of thousands in the 1950s, to more than 3 million - or around 6 per cent of the total population. While the number of whites is virtually static, higher fertility and net immigration means the number from ethnic minorities is growing by 2 to 3 per cent a year. One demographer, who didn't want to be named for fear of being called racist, said: 'It's a matter of pure arithmetic that, if nothing else happens, non-Euro peans will become a majority and whites a minority in the UK. That would probably be the first time an indigenous population has voluntarily become a minority in its historic homeland.' Lee Jasper, race relations adviser to the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, predicted a similar future, telling The Observer : 'Where America goes, Europe follows 30 years later. There is a potential for whites to become a minority in some European countries.' In Britain, that is almost certain to happen in London, and in the relatively near future. 'At the moment ethnic minorities are about 40 per cent in London. The demographics show that white people in London will become a minority by 2010,' said Jasper. 'We could have a majority black Britain by the turn of the century.' British National Party chairman Nick Griffin said: 'I don't think there's any doubt that within this century, white people will be a minority in every country in the world.' For Griffin, however, it is a major cause of alarm: 'Every people under the sun have a right to their place under the sun, and the right to survive. If people predicted that Indians would be a minority in India in 2100, everyone would be calling it genocide.' Yasmin Alibhai-Brown of the Foreign Policy Centre, who arrived in London from Uganda in 1972, said such fears are basically racist: 'Only white people worry about this. It's because for such a long time the world has been their own. To talk about it feeds a particular type of racism that says that blacks breed like rabbits. There is an underlying assumption that says white is right.' She added: 'There is a white panic every time one part of their world seems to be passing over to anyone else. But it's foolish to panic about it. So what if we do become a majority? What difference does it make?' For Alibhai-Brown, the decline of whites is a question of redressing the balance after they colonised much of the world. 'The empire strikes back really. There was this extraordinary assumption that white people could go and destroy peoples and it would have no consequence. It astounds me,' she said. But present trends have little chance of redressing the injustices of history. Native Americans used to have the lands to themselves but are now less than 1 per cent of the US population, with little chance of becoming a majority again. The biggest growth is among Latinos (largely derived from Spain), and Asians, particularly from China and the Phillippines. Jasper said the concerns of the British National Party are based on outdated ideas. 'The racial mix of nations changes all the time. There is no way that ethnicity of blood can be tied to a specific geographic place in a global world. You can no longer look at ethnic states, saying that Germany is Anglo-Saxon and so on.' Jasper felt the process would strengthen Britain. 'Diversity strengthens a country. It makes it more exciting. We have hundreds of languages spoken, when we go out to eat we never eat English, we eat Thai or French or Indian. It makes London a very cool place to live and work.' Nor does it seem likely that whites will become marginalised in terms of influences, even if their numbers decline. David Owen, of the Centre for Research in Ethnic Relations at Warwick Univer sity, said: 'Population has never been the main determinant of influence - it's wealth and income. White people still have their hands on most of the levers of military and economic power.' Even so, Griffin warns that, as in Germany and the US, the rise of ethnic minorities will lead to a backlash. 'It's going to put race to the top of the political agenda,' he said. But that seems unlikely. Britain has far less of a track record of racism and right-wing extremism than other European countries. Alibhai-Brown insisted that rising numbers of ethnic minorities could even help reduce what racism there is: 'The right-wing parties are growing in Somerset, not Brixton. The idea that more black people means more racism is not born out by the research. The more of us there are, it reduces racism.' Back in California, in a land built by immigrants, Bustamente put a positive spin on the end of the white majority: 'If there are no majorities, then there's no minorities.' In Europe, with its 40,000-year-old indigenous white population, the rise of a non-white majority may not be greeted with such equanimity. \u0095 In the United Kingdom, the number of people from ethnic minorities has risen from a few tens of thousands in 1950 to more than 3 million now. \u0095 In Italy, the birth rate is so low that, without immigration, the population is predicted to decline by 16 million by 2050. \u0095 The United States government predicts that non-hispanic whites will become a minority in the country by 2055. \u0095 The United Nations predicts that 98 per cent of world population growth until 2025 will be in developing nations. \u0095 The population of Europe is expected to drop from 25 per cent of the world total in 1900 to 7 per cent in the next 50 years.",

Livingstone is expected to echo his comments this week when he announces the review, involving carnival organisers, police, the London Arts Board and other interested bodies.

The Metropolitan Police, far closer to the problem than Dr Fox, produced a sensitive and sensible guide on how police officers should deal with the many non-Caucasian, non-Christian communities that make up modern Britain. Hard-headed police chiefs in London recognise that, even more than New York, it is the world's greatest immigrant city. Britain, more than any other country, has been a nation of what the French call m\u00e9tissage - the mixing together of different peoples, faiths and races.</p> <p>There is nothing new in this. Three hundred years ago, Daniel Defoe wrote his poem 'The True-Born Englishman', pointing out the ethnic diversity of what he called our 'mongrel race'. Far from being a source of weakness or loss of identity, the mixed blood that courses through our veins has been a core strength.</p> <p>Hugenots, Kashmiris, Jews, Chinese, Poles, Sikhs, Trinidadians have succeeded each other as wave after wave of immigrants and asylum-seekers crash-landed on our shores. The energy, the global world view, the knowledge of other languages and cultures has enriched Britain in the past and today. Britain always despises immigrants to begin with, then realises the contribution that they make, and finally stops noticing the difference.</p> <p>We should celebrate the fact. Compared with other major European nations which have the same level of non-European, non-Christian immigrants as we do, Britain is light-years ahead in showing that a country need not be defined by colour and accent. Look at our television newsreaders, our footballers, our novelists and many of our public figures and modern Britain can be proud of being Europe's first country of m\u00e9tissage .</p> <p>In this, Britain is a lot closer to America where city halls, police departments and nightly television news shows would be unthinkable without a black presence. In contrast, administrations on mainland Europe as well as the Brussels bureaucracy remain all-white affairs.</p> <p>The logic of a declining birth-rate and the need to rejuvenate Europe's ageing population will begin to work its way through our sclerotic thinking. Pre-war European xenophobia and racism forced many of the cleverest of Europeans to leave Russia, Lithuania, Poland and Austria. Most went to the United States to provide that most precious of gifts - energetic, hard-working, ambitious people ready to make a new life.</p> <p>Again today, the United States and Canada are awash with new races, new languages - George W. Bush and Al Gore campaign in Spanish - and new cultures. If he wins, George W. Bush has said he will up the number of immigrants allowed into America.

He is now William Hague's spokesperson on health matters and as such has called for foreign doctors and nurses in the NHS to sit language tests. He claimed that people's health might be put in jeopardy by patient and doctor or nurse not understanding each other. The suggestion was so widely derided and correctly seen as a simple piece of racist pandering that the best Dr Fox can do is go off and drink a quick 14 pints before moving on to the next bit of xenophobic prejudice the Tories will throw at us. I doubt if there is a single Observer reader who has not been profoundly grateful at some stage of their lives for the care given by a doctor or nurse whose first language is not English. Medicine is a universal, non-national profession. Go into any hospital in Europe or America and it is pulsating with doctors and nurses of different nationalities. Last week there was an intervention on race and immigrants of a different sort. The Metropolitan Police, far closer to the problem than Dr Fox, produced a sensitive and sensible guide on how police officers should deal with the many non-Caucasian, non-Christian communities that make up modern Britain. Hard-headed police chiefs in London recognise that, even more than New York, it is the world's greatest immigrant city. Britain, more than any other country, has been a nation of what the French call m\u00e9tissage - the mixing together of different peoples, faiths and races. There is nothing new in this. Three hundred years ago, Daniel Defoe wrote his poem 'The True-Born Englishman', pointing out the ethnic diversity of what he called our 'mongrel race'. Far from being a source of weakness or loss of identity, the mixed blood that courses through our veins has been a core strength. Hugenots, Kashmiris, Jews, Chinese, Poles, Sikhs, Trinidadians have succeeded each other as wave after wave of immigrants and asylum-seekers crash-landed on our shores. The energy, the global world view, the knowledge of other languages and cultures has enriched Britain in the past and today. Britain always despises immigrants to begin with, then realises the contribution that they make, and finally stops noticing the difference. We should celebrate the fact. Compared with other major European nations which have the same level of non-European, non-Christian immigrants as we do, Britain is light-years ahead in showing that a country need not be defined by colour and accent. Look at our television newsreaders, our footballers, our novelists and many of our public figures and modern Britain can be proud of being Europe's first country of m\u00e9tissage . In this, Britain is a lot closer to America where city halls, police departments and nightly television news shows would be unthinkable without a black presence. In contrast, administrations on mainland Europe as well as the Brussels bureaucracy remain all-white affairs. The logic of a declining birth-rate and the need to rejuvenate Europe's ageing population will begin to work its way through our sclerotic thinking. Pre-war European xenophobia and racism forced many of the cleverest of Europeans to leave Russia, Lithuania, Poland and Austria. Most went to the United States to provide that most precious of gifts - energetic, hard-working, ambitious people ready to make a new life. Again today, the United States and Canada are awash with new races, new languages - George W. Bush and Al Gore campaign in Spanish - and new cultures. If he wins, George W. Bush has said he will up the number of immigrants allowed into America. Europe should follow America's example and rejoice rather than reject the diverse people seeking to bring energy and ideas to our countries. \u0095 Denis MacShane is Labour MP for Rotherham",

Its website was among the top five visited in the UK and the firm sold \u00a375m of goods up to July. Venture capitalists 3i put \u00a31m in at the start and pumped in more money in the summer. So what else went wrong? 'The difficulty for Steve was jungle couldn't earn enough gross profits to cover costs,' one insider said. 'So month by month, creditworthiness got worse. Suppliers start to keep you on a short lease and you can't get enough stock. That affected jungle seriously.' By the time of the GUS deal, 3i already owned around a third of jungle, and Bennett's stake faced even further dilution, with no guarantee the credit issue would go away. As another retailer says: 'In those conditions, a sale is the sensible answer. There are many dotcoms in the same boat but few like jungle are attractive enough to the GUSs, Dixons or Kingfishers waiting to pick up the pieces.'",

      "body": "<p>So you want to make a film? Before you do that, you have to prove you can. And the only way round this Catch-22 is to make your film a short, an affordable five- or 10-minute calling card showing your mastery of structure, photography and coaxing decent performances from your stars - at best drama students, most likely complete amateurs. </p> <p>Doug Miller, co-founder of the non-profit Short Film Bureau, thinks this is the best way to learn the trade. 'We took the perspective that for the British film industry to be globally competitive, its indigenous filmmakers have to truly understand the market they are working with, and the only way to truly understand that market is through participation in it.' The Short Film Bureau has set up the Filmgoer's Award for Cinematic Excellence (F.A.C.E), co-sponsored by The Observer, to offer a selection of shorts a choice spot before a mainstream feature. </p> <p>Kicking off a career via shorts has become a dominant British way: without a full-scale industry, the chances for directors to work their way from production assistant to second unit director or editor and then director are few and far between. That's not to say that the American directors don't also make shorts; the movie brat generation, especially, grew up with little home Super 8s or 16mm cameras in their hands; Spielberg and Scorsese both made notable short films. And George Lucas's debut feature THX 1138 was a reworking of a 15-minute movie he had made three years earlier. But they all had intermediate stages to go through before making films that their reputations rested on. </p> <p>In Britain, the short film can be all important. 'There is a difference in the way this industry matures its talent,' Miller contin ues. 'There is a culture in this country that says \"go out and prove yourself by making a short\". And that's not necessarily a bad thing. It creates an irony and a Catch-22 in that it is difficult for these new film-makers to get their shorts shown. But it is a good thing that film-makers grow up by making films, and the Lottery funding has really helped elevate the quality level.' </p> <p>You can see the successful products of this path: Shane Meadows, Guy Ritchie and Lynne Ramsey have all followed it, while successful short director Jamie Thraves won praise when his debut feature film The Low Down premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival recently. Ramsey is the shining example: being showered with prizes for her shorts put her in the position to make the daring Ratcatcher as a first film. </p> <p>Over recent years this seems to have taken over from the traditional route of learning the ropes at the BBC and then branching out into feature films. Opportunities no longer exist at the BBC in the way they did in the heyday of Alan Clarke, Mike Leigh and Ken Loach. Which is why the Short Film Bureau thinks that the directors whose work is in competition for the Audience Choice Awards are the future. 'The Bureau's emphasis is not on the short films themselves but on the film-makers,' says Miller. </p> <p>For not everyone sees short films as something you do on the way to making a feature. Most short-film directors will never make anything longer. And shorts do exist as an artform in themselves. The only real definition of a short film, after all, is that it is a film not long enough to be considered a feature. That can mean as long as an hour, although most festivals and the Short Film Bureau prefer under 30 minutes, while 10 minutes is the ideal time if you're hoping to run it before a feature; at the artier end of things, under a minute is not unknown. </p> <p>There are feature film directors who intersperse long movies with shorts. Not many, admittedly, but Werner Herzog has done it throughout his strange and never dull career, and so has Hal Hartley. </p> <p>Then there are the films that are so important that their shortness is often overlooked. Take the trio of Bu\u00f1uel and Dali's Un Chien Andalou (1929), Chris Marker's La Jet\u00e9e (1962) and Kenneth Anger's Scorpio Rising (1964) - three films that wouldn't have been viable at feature length, three films that took advantage of how much more abstract you can be in a shorter film, relying on startling imagery rather than narrative to keep people interested. All three were seen as strange, obscure and - in the case of Un Chien Andalou and Scorpio Rising - obscene, at the time, and all three have had an influence that has seeped into mainstream culture. </p> <p>This has been largely in indirect ways, but sometimes as blatant as a classic pop song ( Un Chien Andalou inspiring the Pixies's 'Debaser') or a hit film starring Bruce Willis (the reworking of La Jet\u00e9e as Twelve Monkeys ). </p> <p>All of Anger's films, in fact, are shorts, which must have been a matter of choice because at the same time Andy Warhol was proving that no-budget, experimental films could be as long as you liked. Which brings us to the blurred line between short films and film art: what are Gillian Wearing, Jane and Louise Wilson and Steve McQueen (the British artist, not the dead American icon) doing if not making short films? </p> <p>Meanwhile, back in the world of short films that call themselves short films, things are bustling. All films, in this era of cheap DV cameras and iMacs, are easier to make. But budget, logic and a certain amount of realism mean most aspiring film-makers aren't starting out by shooting something three hours long. There are short film festivals besides the Audience Choice Awards: the Rushes Soho Shorts Festival that runs in August, Brief Encounters in Bristol in November and the BBC British Short Film Festival which runs in September. </p> <p>Apart from these there are the short film evenings, most famously run by London's Hallowe'en Society, which use shorts as part of a night out rather than a traditional filmgoing experience, often throwing in a bit of music along the way. I remember one event - not organised by the Hallowe'en Society - in which a couple of terrible shorts starring The Fall's Mark E. Smith were sandwiched around a ramshackle performance by the man himself. </p> <p>But that's the fun of short films: at best, you never know what you're going to get. Often, the ones that just leave you dumbfounded prove more memorable than the big star-slumming and the all too predictable plot twist you often get with the bigger budget variety. Too often, short films seem to have caught the disease of written short stories, relying on some kind of tricky punchline. </p> <p>Most of all, though, short films are prospering because they are perfect for the internet. Just this week a new and, at first glance, well-organised British short film website (<a href=\"http://www.in-movies.co.uk\">www.in-movies.co.uk</a>) was launched. Fears of mass web piracy of features seem exaggerated for the moment because of slow download times, but running a two-minute film seems to be within the capacity of most home computers.

But it would have been wrong to introduce prematurely just to tackle one aspect of one issue, namely parades.</p> <p>'We felt it was premature because the police, the judges and the Parades Commission were not up to speed on the legislation when the Secretary of State wanted to introduce it. I want to stress that we are delighted that we are getting a Human Rights Act but we felt the time was not right.</p> <p>'As for the legislation helping the loyal orders, that is not necessarily the case, although we can expect to see legal challenges to Parades Commission determinations on marches in the future,' Dickson said.</p> <p>On 16 February, the Northern Ireland Secretary indicated he wanted the Human Rights Act implemented earlier than in the rest of the UK, because it would help end disputes relating to parades.</p> <p>However, a spokesman for Mandelson accepted that opposition scuppered his plans. The other major institution opposed to the early introduction of the Act was the Orange Order: it ignored suggestions by David Trimble, Ulster Unionist leader and First Minister, that the Act would help its case in the marching dispute.</p> <p>Willie Thompson, Ulster Unionist MP for West Tyrone, called on the loyal orders to use the new legislation to their own advantage. 'Some unionists are asking why the commission didn't want the Act introduced during the marching season. Now that we are getting this Act, I think there is scope for the Orange Order, the Apprentice Boys and the Royal Black Preceptory to take any future determinations by the Parades Commission to court,' Thompson said.</p> <p>Human rights campaigners believe Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights backs the loyal orders' campaign to march along contentious routes. It guarantees freedom of thought, conscience and religion and declares that the 'freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitation as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.'</p>",

Mandelson wanted to introduce the Act into Northern Ireland, which under Article 9 would have enshrined Orangemen's and Apprentice Boys' right to free assembly. But minutes of a meeting of the commission, set up by Labour following the Good Friday Agreement, warn about 'the proposed premature introduction of the Human Rights Act with respect to parades'. Unionists claim the commission's opposition to the early introduction of the Act is proof that the body is weighted in favour of nationalists. Brice Dickson, NIHRC chairman, said the commission opposed the implementation of the Act ahead of the rest of the UK because it was 'piecemeal and premature'. 'Peter Mandelson thought it would show the Government was doing something for the Orange Order and the other loyal orders. But it would have been wrong to introduce prematurely just to tackle one aspect of one issue, namely parades. 'We felt it was premature because the police, the judges and the Parades Commission were not up to speed on the legislation when the Secretary of State wanted to introduce it. I want to stress that we are delighted that we are getting a Human Rights Act but we felt the time was not right. 'As for the legislation helping the loyal orders, that is not necessarily the case, although we can expect to see legal challenges to Parades Commission determinations on marches in the future,' Dickson said. On 16 February, the Northern Ireland Secretary indicated he wanted the Human Rights Act implemented earlier than in the rest of the UK, because it would help end disputes relating to parades. However, a spokesman for Mandelson accepted that opposition scuppered his plans. The other major institution opposed to the early introduction of the Act was the Orange Order: it ignored suggestions by David Trimble, Ulster Unionist leader and First Minister, that the Act would help its case in the marching dispute. Willie Thompson, Ulster Unionist MP for West Tyrone, called on the loyal orders to use the new legislation to their own advantage. 'Some unionists are asking why the commission didn't want the Act introduced during the marching season. Now that we are getting this Act, I think there is scope for the Orange Order, the Apprentice Boys and the Royal Black Preceptory to take any future determinations by the Parades Commission to court,' Thompson said. Human rights campaigners believe Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights backs the loyal orders' campaign to march along contentious routes. It guarantees freedom of thought, conscience and religion and declares that the 'freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitation as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.'",

      "body": "<p>The food lover's year starts here. I roasted the first of the golden squash from Borough Market last night, each no bigger than a Bramley apple, their hollows stuffed with butter, sea salt and finely chopped red chilli (just less than an hour at gas mark 6). I have already steamed a net of the new season's mussels with white wine and, as a change from the usual tarragon, some leaves of lemon thyme. So tiny, so sweet. They took less than a minute with the lid on tight and full steam up. We sponged up their fishy-winey-lemony liquor with tufts torn from a sourdough loaf, leaving be the inevitable grit at the bottom of our bowls. </p> <p>Wild duck came into season a couple of days ago. It is smaller, neater and leaner than the farmyard birds and, conveniently, just enough for two. No fiddly knifework; you just hack it down the breast bone with your scariest knife. Whether you choose this or a plump farm bird, you may like to abandon the traditional cherry sauce or green olives - its rich flesh needs neither. Just rub salt all over the skin and up its flue - thoroughly, laddishly, with your hands, rather than delicately ground from a mill - then tuck a halved and peeled onion deep inside. Roast in a very hot oven till the skin is crisp and the flesh is more brown than pink. Rare duck, despite what French chefs tell us, tastes of nothing. The wild version will be done in 20-25 minutes, maybe even less, at 230 C/gas mark 8. </p> <p>On the side I would add a soft mound of just-cooked spinach, still emerald bright. Unusual, I know, but there are some fine bunches around now and the juicy leaf works well with the salty duck. Peas would be eminently suitable here, too, and I am tempted by the home-grown pods that are still around in the market, though I haven't had the courage to try them this late before. </p> <p>Don't miss Royalty, the purple-black dwarf bean that is around for the next few weeks, if only for its fleeting novelty value (it turns green when you cook it), and make the most of the late runner beans. Have you noticed how they curl up as the season progresses? Perhaps they're feeling the cold. We will miss the locally grown when they are gone. For a change, boil the sliced beans briefly, then shake them in a shallow pan of warm butter in which you have softened a shallot, chopped so finely it almost melts in the heat. </p> <p>The majestic blood-red and bottle-green ruby chard is here again and, if you are lucky, the harlequin rainbow variety with its ribbed stems - a Bridget Rileyesque mix of orange, candy pink and saffron. Steam the stripped leaves, then butter them; then boil the stalks and drizzle with olive oil and the juice of a sweet, fat lemon. I have been known to throw in some rough-cut mint into the butter, too. Not so strange, really - mint and butter please an earthy vegetable. </p> <p>Round, green-freckled summer squash such as Ronde de Nice and the crisp, warm yellow Gold Rush zucchini make a quick, light late-summer supper. I slice them into thick rounds, steam them for a minute or two, then let them soften and colour in olive oil and chopped herbs such as lovage or tarragon. Or eat them as they do at Levant (76 Wigmore Street, London W1; 020 224 1111), Liam Carson's new basement eaterie, which serves blissful, spice-laden, warm Arab breads and baba ganoush. Here the zucchini come softly fried with olive oil and chopped mint. An idea I have copied twice at home since eating them chez Levant. </p> <p>Basil of all kinds - pot, purple, lemon or cinnamon - are at their heady best. Don't forget the Thai variety tastes of aniseed. As it is pointless to cook with anything so delicate, I add the torn leaves at the last minute to warm couscous or white rice with a spoonful of molten butter and, of course, pasta with some thick olive oil. A little warmth rather than heat makes them even more spicy. Look out for exceptionally large, flat leaves in Italian delis; they look coarse, but they have the deepest, most peppery flavour of all. Mash them by the handful with plump, tight garlic, salt and olive oil to make a loose pesto. It will keep in the fridge for a few days, but you must cover the surface with a layer of olive oil. </p> <p>I like to give waxy, torpedo-style Charlotte salad potatoes their last shout of the year in a clean-edged salad with sliced rollmops, shredded dill fronds and sweet red onion. Reckon on one fillet of fish for every two potatoes. I use one of the Danish or German bottled varieties, which seem to contain less onion and citric acid than the Scottish ones. Last week I boiled the knobbly Charlotte potatoes, peeled off their pink-brown skins and cut them into hefty chunks before tossing them with the fish, herbs and a dressing of cider vinegar and walnut oil. (Use 1 tbsp of vinegar to 4 tbsp of oil.) I offered them with that dark, chewy, granular rye bread that comes in vac-packs. </p> <p>Cheeses in particularly fine fettle at this time of the year include melting Brie de Meaux, with its faintly fungal scent and softly oozing centre. We shouldn't take this cheese for granted, but we do. For something firmer, try a wedge of sheep's milk Wigmore from a British cheese specialist such as Neal's Yard - its mottled rind hides a nutty flavoured, clean-tasting cheese. Made in the south-east of England by Anne Wigmore, it is not inappropriate offered with the mild and crunchy Kentish cob nuts whose season is so short. You can't miss them in their frilly green dresses. </p> <p>We can say goodbye to apples from down under till spring. There's new year's fruit at the farmer's market - cheeky, crimson-blushed Discoveries, with their rose-tinted flesh. A tiny short-season fruit to munch in the hand - my favourite apple, though for nostalgic reasons rather than flavour. Hot on their tail is the scarlet and yellow Katy. The Worcesters will be along soon. But stop. Let's not rush into autumn - there are still blackcurrants for crumble and the tail end of the redcurrants and raspberries for the last summer pudding till 2001. </p> <p>September belongs the plum. Look out for Opal, which comes small, sweet and luminous, in every shade of ochre to purple. Avalon, a larger egg-shaped fruit is here, too, but wait till its green blush has all but gone. The more purple, the richer the flavour. Eat these tender early-bird plums as they are; we can cook with the bigger ones later. </p> <p>Greengages, no bigger than a blackbird's egg, are this month's dessert fruit. Ripen them on a warm sill until they're tender and honey-scented. I reckon they should appear virtually translucent. An after-dinner plate with more of those crunchy green cob nuts. </p> <p>Damsons are here for the first crumble of the year. Leave the stones in, toss 750g of the wet fruit in sugar, then cover with a pebble-dash crust of 125g each of flour, butter and ground almonds with 3 tbsp of sugar blitzed to loose crumbs in the Magimix. Bake at 180 C/gas mark 4 till the fruits' purple-black juice bubbles through. I added some Dorset blueberries to mine, though I could have used the blackberries from the garden. </p> <p>There are new cookbooks at the end of the month from Nigella Lawson and Rowley Leigh (and me), and of which more another time, but look out next week for Wolf in the Kitchen by Lindsay Bareham (\u00a39.99, Penguin). Give one to every student who is just about to head back and bookmark the Masoor dhal (page 216). It's cheap, and mildly spiced, and will become a trusted blueprint on which to base a few hundred variations from their store of lentils. </p> <p>To paraphrase the Wolf: peel and chop a few onions and 3 large garlic cloves, heat 3 tbsp of oil in a saucepan, then add the onions, stirring till they are brown. With the heat reduced, stir in the garlic, a pinch of cayenne, 175g red split lentils, tsp of ground cumin and 600ml of water. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer till the dhal is thick and the lentils tender. Stir in tsp of salt, pepper, cumin, a squeeze of lemon juice and about 30 mint leaves. Enough for 4, and I can't stop eating it. </p> <p>Those who can manage more than a banana for breakfast might like to check out the buttermilk fruit pancakes with maple syrup or the Proven\u00e7al yogurt, fruit and honey at Villandry's new bar (170 Great Portland Street, London W1; 020 7631 3131). </p> <p>It is not all good news, of course. The unstoppable march of the bland has reached Marks and Spencer's feta cheese, which is not only totally devoid of this toothsome Greek's characteristic salty-piquancy, but boasts the legend 'Made in France'. Do track down the yummy sweet-potato fritters from its new Fusion range, inspired by New Zealander Peter Gordon, before it discontinues them. And, while I'm having a moan, did you know that Hartley's depressing new range of That's Fruity jams come in a squeezable tube - like toothpaste? </p> <p>To end on a high note, the best news of all is that there are deep claret-coloured, late-season raspberries from Scotland around again. A perfect finale to your roast grouse, with its puddle of bread sauce and clear gravy. No meal quite reflects the change from summer to autumn so perfectly.</p>",

I have already steamed a net of the new season's mussels with white wine and, as a change from the usual tarragon, some leaves of lemon thyme. So tiny, so sweet. They took less than a minute with the lid on tight and full steam up. We sponged up their fishy-winey-lemony liquor with tufts torn from a sourdough loaf, leaving be the inevitable grit at the bottom of our bowls. Wild duck came into season a couple of days ago. It is smaller, neater and leaner than the farmyard birds and, conveniently, just enough for two. No fiddly knifework; you just hack it down the breast bone with your scariest knife. Whether you choose this or a plump farm bird, you may like to abandon the traditional cherry sauce or green olives - its rich flesh needs neither. Just rub salt all over the skin and up its flue - thoroughly, laddishly, with your hands, rather than delicately ground from a mill - then tuck a halved and peeled onion deep inside. Roast in a very hot oven till the skin is crisp and the flesh is more brown than pink. Rare duck, despite what French chefs tell us, tastes of nothing. The wild version will be done in 20-25 minutes, maybe even less, at 230 C/gas mark 8. On the side I would add a soft mound of just-cooked spinach, still emerald bright. Unusual, I know, but there are some fine bunches around now and the juicy leaf works well with the salty duck. Peas would be eminently suitable here, too, and I am tempted by the home-grown pods that are still around in the market, though I haven't had the courage to try them this late before. Don't miss Royalty, the purple-black dwarf bean that is around for the next few weeks, if only for its fleeting novelty value (it turns green when you cook it), and make the most of the late runner beans. Have you noticed how they curl up as the season progresses? Perhaps they're feeling the cold. We will miss the locally grown when they are gone. For a change, boil the sliced beans briefly, then shake them in a shallow pan of warm butter in which you have softened a shallot, chopped so finely it almost melts in the heat. The majestic blood-red and bottle-green ruby chard is here again and, if you are lucky, the harlequin rainbow variety with its ribbed stems - a Bridget Rileyesque mix of orange, candy pink and saffron. Steam the stripped leaves, then butter them; then boil the stalks and drizzle with olive oil and the juice of a sweet, fat lemon. I have been known to throw in some rough-cut mint into the butter, too. Not so strange, really - mint and butter please an earthy vegetable. Round, green-freckled summer squash such as Ronde de Nice and the crisp, warm yellow Gold Rush zucchini make a quick, light late-summer supper. I slice them into thick rounds, steam them for a minute or two, then let them soften and colour in olive oil and chopped herbs such as lovage or tarragon. Or eat them as they do at Levant (76 Wigmore Street, London W1; 020 224 1111), Liam Carson's new basement eaterie, which serves blissful, spice-laden, warm Arab breads and baba ganoush. Here the zucchini come softly fried with olive oil and chopped mint. An idea I have copied twice at home since eating them chez Levant. Basil of all kinds - pot, purple, lemon or cinnamon - are at their heady best. Don't forget the Thai variety tastes of aniseed. As it is pointless to cook with anything so delicate, I add the torn leaves at the last minute to warm couscous or white rice with a spoonful of molten butter and, of course, pasta with some thick olive oil. A little warmth rather than heat makes them even more spicy. Look out for exceptionally large, flat leaves in Italian delis; they look coarse, but they have the deepest, most peppery flavour of all. Mash them by the handful with plump, tight garlic, salt and olive oil to make a loose pesto. It will keep in the fridge for a few days, but you must cover the surface with a layer of olive oil. I like to give waxy, torpedo-style Charlotte salad potatoes their last shout of the year in a clean-edged salad with sliced rollmops, shredded dill fronds and sweet red onion. Reckon on one fillet of fish for every two potatoes. I use one of the Danish or German bottled varieties, which seem to contain less onion and citric acid than the Scottish ones. Last week I boiled the knobbly Charlotte potatoes, peeled off their pink-brown skins and cut them into hefty chunks before tossing them with the fish, herbs and a dressing of cider vinegar and walnut oil. (Use 1 tbsp of vinegar to 4 tbsp of oil.) I offered them with that dark, chewy, granular rye bread that comes in vac-packs. Cheeses in particularly fine fettle at this time of the year include melting Brie de Meaux, with its faintly fungal scent and softly oozing centre. We shouldn't take this cheese for granted, but we do. For something firmer, try a wedge of sheep's milk Wigmore from a British cheese specialist such as Neal's Yard - its mottled rind hides a nutty flavoured, clean-tasting cheese. Made in the south-east of England by Anne Wigmore, it is not inappropriate offered with the mild and crunchy Kentish cob nuts whose season is so short. You can't miss them in their frilly green dresses. We can say goodbye to apples from down under till spring. There's new year's fruit at the farmer's market - cheeky, crimson-blushed Discoveries, with their rose-tinted flesh. A tiny short-season fruit to munch in the hand - my favourite apple, though for nostalgic reasons rather than flavour. Hot on their tail is the scarlet and yellow Katy. The Worcesters will be along soon. But stop. Let's not rush into autumn - there are still blackcurrants for crumble and the tail end of the redcurrants and raspberries for the last summer pudding till 2001. September belongs the plum. Look out for Opal, which comes small, sweet and luminous, in every shade of ochre to purple. Avalon, a larger egg-shaped fruit is here, too, but wait till its green blush has all but gone. The more purple, the richer the flavour. Eat these tender early-bird plums as they are; we can cook with the bigger ones later. Greengages, no bigger than a blackbird's egg, are this month's dessert fruit. Ripen them on a warm sill until they're tender and honey-scented. I reckon they should appear virtually translucent. An after-dinner plate with more of those crunchy green cob nuts. Damsons are here for the first crumble of the year. Leave the stones in, toss 750g of the wet fruit in sugar, then cover with a pebble-dash crust of 125g each of flour, butter and ground almonds with 3 tbsp of sugar blitzed to loose crumbs in the Magimix. Bake at 180 C/gas mark 4 till the fruits' purple-black juice bubbles through. I added some Dorset blueberries to mine, though I could have used the blackberries from the garden. There are new cookbooks at the end of the month from Nigella Lawson and Rowley Leigh (and me), and of which more another time, but look out next week for Wolf in the Kitchen by Lindsay Bareham (\u00a39.99, Penguin). Give one to every student who is just about to head back and bookmark the Masoor dhal (page 216). It's cheap, and mildly spiced, and will become a trusted blueprint on which to base a few hundred variations from their store of lentils. To paraphrase the Wolf: peel and chop a few onions and 3 large garlic cloves, heat 3 tbsp of oil in a saucepan, then add the onions, stirring till they are brown. With the heat reduced, stir in the garlic, a pinch of cayenne, 175g red split lentils, tsp of ground cumin and 600ml of water. Bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer till the dhal is thick and the lentils tender. Stir in tsp of salt, pepper, cumin, a squeeze of lemon juice and about 30 mint leaves. Enough for 4, and I can't stop eating it. Those who can manage more than a banana for breakfast might like to check out the buttermilk fruit pancakes with maple syrup or the Proven\u00e7al yogurt, fruit and honey at Villandry's new bar (170 Great Portland Street, London W1; 020 7631 3131). It is not all good news, of course. The unstoppable march of the bland has reached Marks and Spencer's feta cheese, which is not only totally devoid of this toothsome Greek's characteristic salty-piquancy, but boasts the legend 'Made in France'. Do track down the yummy sweet-potato fritters from its new Fusion range, inspired by New Zealander Peter Gordon, before it discontinues them. And, while I'm having a moan, did you know that Hartley's depressing new range of That's Fruity jams come in a squeezable tube - like toothpaste? To end on a high note, the best news of all is that there are deep claret-coloured, late-season raspberries from Scotland around again. A perfect finale to your roast grouse, with its puddle of bread sauce and clear gravy. No meal quite reflects the change from summer to autumn so perfectly.",

      "body": "<p>The directions to Adam and Katy Waterman's house in Stocksmoor are clear enough, but this part of south-west Yorkshire is lushly rural, its deep lanes overhung with sycamore, dipping and rising from intense green to black shade then revealing huge views. There are places that you pass that are not on the map and places that are on the map, but which never materialise. I got lost. </p> <p>Stocksmoor is a village in the nexus of industrial Yorkshire. Those dark, satanic mills are set in some of the loveliest countryside in Britain. Just up the road is Holmfirth, where Last of the Summer Wine has been filmed for the past 200 years. Town and country have no real border here. </p> <p>Finally I found their house, last in a row of terraced cottages flanking a long road. Over the door was a Clematis 'Montana', the flowers long faded and nearly invisible, as the whole frontage is practically obscured. Adam and Katy have four small children, and the front garden is dedicated to them, a playground of Wendy house, decking, slide and sandpit all set within bananas, palms, gourds scrambling over a trellised walk, and an igloo made from willow they call a 'cave'. I know these things because for a few months earlier this summer, Adam and Katy were participants in Channel 4's Real Gardens . </p> <p>Go out the back door and walk along the path through the back gardens - there are fields on one side, back doors on the other. A hundred yards takes you to a recreation ground and a small group of allotments - 14 in all, held by nine people. This communal back garden for this row of households accentuates how public the front, 'private' bits are. The real life is lived out the back, cheek by jowl and, like any allotment, under close scrutiny. Most of the allotment holders overlook the site and are neighbours. Their children and grandchildren play next to it. This makes the allotment, normally underpinned with a sense of urban displacement, a halfway house between gardening and farming, almost like the village green. In fact, the original allotments were in the middle of the village but were moved to the present site. The land plus the 'rec' were left by Lord Norton for the community of Stocksmoor. </p> <p>This is not easy gardening. The wind blows in off the moors, summer comes late and winter early. The soil is thin and hungry, and slips downhill to where the train into Sheffield rumbles unseen in a wooded cutting. But it is lovely. All of us - and I am the worst culprit ever - with our buttoned-up gardens and hedges like lace curtains are missing out on the openness and shared experience of gardening in this kind of small, very local allotment. </p> <p>I know a number of men who take an allotment in their thirties just as they toy with adultery or scuba diving - a mid-life need for diversion and self-realisation that involves other places, other people and some kit. But Adam's conversion is the real thing. A few years ago, he was an ardent clubber, coming in at 5am. Now he gets up at 5am to go to his allotments. He has three plots, one dominated by a large polytunnel. That is a serious commitment, the equivalent - given that allotments are as intensive as gardening can possibly be - of four large urban gardens. Put that into context: Adam is a student liaison officer at the University of Huddersfield; he has four children under seven which, despite Katy being one of those extraordinary women who does three things at once well, means real involvement, as she is a lawyer with the Crown Prosecution Service; he is a magistrate, a reader, a great chatterer and inventive cook. The allotments are weft in a busy weave. </p> <p>Adam is a committed organic gardener. When he took on his first plot in 1997, it had been untouched for five years, a tangle of couch, bramble and weeds. Next year he took another abandoned plot. He put up his tunnel on a third plot earlier this year. Each allotment was roughly 10 poles or 300 sq yds (about the size of a 100ft by 30ft back garden). As he would not spray, all this had to be dug and cleared by hand. He intended it to be the only digging he did - he was determined to run his allotments on the 'no-dig' method. This is based on a belief that digging destroys the soil's delicate microstructure and balance. The feeding roots of most plants are near the surface of the soil, and the no-dig system demands a layer of well-rotted compost laid on top as a mulch each spring, which is worked into the soil by worms during the year. The only absolute to this method (which I find inadequate for heavy or light ground) is that you never walk or tread on the soil - this compacts it and destroys the microstructure - so Adam made dozens of raised beds. </p> <p>You can imagine the talk along the terrace. Adam, an Essex boy, new to gardening, declares himself organic and makes dozens of raised beds... He then started what he calls his 'paper thing'. He covered his beds with great sheets of white landscape paper. His fellow allotmenteers had seen nothing like it. In summer, when their ground was thick with orderly rows of vegetables, fruit and weeds, his area looked like ranks of coffee tables dressed with snow and sprouting blocks of produce. But even the most curmudgeonly gardener could see that there was method in his madness. The paper suppresses weeds, holds in moisture and reflects light back up to the growing plants. By the end of the season, it had rotted into the ground. And his allotments were cared for. Last year he won the village Best Vegetable Garden prize, which he admits was 'a shock to all'. </p> <p>The stuff Adam grows is integral to his kitchen, and it does seem to me to be at the heart of all vegetable, herb and fruit growing to actually cook and eat the things. I wonder how many allotment holders cook and eat everything that they grow? </p> <p>I suspect that the polytunnel is where Adam is happiest. At 5am, he is busy in its pearly, cocooned light. The tunnel is warm. And very productive. Tomatoes, sweetcorn, lilies, squashes, cucumbers, peppers and huge onions ripen within the Mediterranean folds of the plastic. It smells fecund. But there are hints at a more conservative Yorkshire past. The onions are being grown as champion specimens 'as an experiment'. The sweetpeas are grown as cordons, producing a handful of perfect show flowers, 'just to try it out'. The melons, carrots and beans include Heritage seeds from the HDRA seed bank, grown to preserve the dying strains of rare vegetables that commerce has no use for. Outside, Adam works hard, but with an almost cavalier faith in his system. Inside the tunnel, the specialised and show plants receive hours of detailed care. This is remarkably similar to the rows of show dahlias and chrysanths of his neighbours, the runner beans selected for their extra length and plate of identical tomatoes chosen for the local flower show. </p> <p>I am writing from the priviliged position of one who has spent days with Adam on his allotment, but I suspect that deep in his horticultural heart, beneath the New Man qualifications, is a flat cap and a fiercely competitive instinct. This, I suspect, is what gets him out of bed at 5am on a rainy Sunday, almost as much as the chance to do something he loves in peace and quiet. </p> <p>I like allotments. I like this gardening in the open - slightly suspicious, slightly competitive, but uncloseted and generous. Wouldn't it be fantastic if more clubbers bought the easy communal generosity of the e-generation to local allotments? I suspect that the old boys, despite the odd mutter and funny look, would love it.</p> <p><strong>My roots: A week in Monty's garden </strong></p> <p>I got very dejected about our garden this week. Partly because I have got to go away next week (on holiday, good for the exhausted TV presenter/writer, but bad for the gardener in harvest time) and partly because there are times when you walk round the garden and suddenly see that it does not come up to your own standards. We all have an idealised picture of the garden that we have carried around in our heads from the moment it became ours and which is never the same as the growing reality. Over the years that the garden comes into being, that image carries you forward and inspires you, but when things reach maturity, the reality can be harsh. The other day, it seemed that this entire garden, in all its 13 different components, was unrealised, dull and wanting. </p> <p>So what to do? I started by doing what I always do in this position (it happens every year, about mid July), and spent a day in the vegetable garden.

      "bodyText": "The directions to Adam and Katy Waterman's house in Stocksmoor are clear enough, but this part of south-west Yorkshire is lushly rural, its deep lanes overhung with sycamore, dipping and rising from intense green to black shade then revealing huge views. There are places that you pass that are not on the map and places that are on the map, but which never materialise. I got lost. Stocksmoor is a village in the nexus of industrial Yorkshire. Those dark, satanic mills are set in some of the loveliest countryside in Britain. Just up the road is Holmfirth, where Last of the Summer Wine has been filmed for the past 200 years. Town and country have no real border here. Finally I found their house, last in a row of terraced cottages flanking a long road. Over the door was a Clematis 'Montana', the flowers long faded and nearly invisible, as the whole frontage is practically obscured. Adam and Katy have four small children, and the front garden is dedicated to them, a playground of Wendy house, decking, slide and sandpit all set within bananas, palms, gourds scrambling over a trellised walk, and an igloo made from willow they call a 'cave'. I know these things because for a few months earlier this summer, Adam and Katy were participants in Channel 4's Real Gardens . Go out the back door and walk along the path through the back gardens - there are fields on one side, back doors on the other. A hundred yards takes you to a recreation ground and a small group of allotments - 14 in all, held by nine people. This communal back garden for this row of households accentuates how public the front, 'private' bits are. The real life is lived out the back, cheek by jowl and, like any allotment, under close scrutiny. Most of the allotment holders overlook the site and are neighbours. Their children and grandchildren play next to it. This makes the allotment, normally underpinned with a sense of urban displacement, a halfway house between gardening and farming, almost like the village green. In fact, the original allotments were in the middle of the village but were moved to the present site. The land plus the 'rec' were left by Lord Norton for the community of Stocksmoor. This is not easy gardening. The wind blows in off the moors, summer comes late and winter early. The soil is thin and hungry, and slips downhill to where the train into Sheffield rumbles unseen in a wooded cutting. But it is lovely. All of us - and I am the worst culprit ever - with our buttoned-up gardens and hedges like lace curtains are missing out on the openness and shared experience of gardening in this kind of small, very local allotment. I know a number of men who take an allotment in their thirties just as they toy with adultery or scuba diving - a mid-life need for diversion and self-realisation that involves other places, other people and some kit. But Adam's conversion is the real thing. A few years ago, he was an ardent clubber, coming in at 5am. Now he gets up at 5am to go to his allotments. He has three plots, one dominated by a large polytunnel. That is a serious commitment, the equivalent - given that allotments are as intensive as gardening can possibly be - of four large urban gardens. Put that into context: Adam is a student liaison officer at the University of Huddersfield; he has four children under seven which, despite Katy being one of those extraordinary women who does three things at once well, means real involvement, as she is a lawyer with the Crown Prosecution Service; he is a magistrate, a reader, a great chatterer and inventive cook. The allotments are weft in a busy weave. Adam is a committed organic gardener. When he took on his first plot in 1997, it had been untouched for five years, a tangle of couch, bramble and weeds. Next year he took another abandoned plot. He put up his tunnel on a third plot earlier this year. Each allotment was roughly 10 poles or 300 sq yds (about the size of a 100ft by 30ft back garden). As he would not spray, all this had to be dug and cleared by hand. He intended it to be the only digging he did - he was determined to run his allotments on the 'no-dig' method. This is based on a belief that digging destroys the soil's delicate microstructure and balance. The feeding roots of most plants are near the surface of the soil, and the no-dig system demands a layer of well-rotted compost laid on top as a mulch each spring, which is worked into the soil by worms during the year. The only absolute to this method (which I find inadequate for heavy or light ground) is that you never walk or tread on the soil - this compacts it and destroys the microstructure - so Adam made dozens of raised beds. You can imagine the talk along the terrace. Adam, an Essex boy, new to gardening, declares himself organic and makes dozens of raised beds... He then started what he calls his 'paper thing'. He covered his beds with great sheets of white landscape paper. His fellow allotmenteers had seen nothing like it. In summer, when their ground was thick with orderly rows of vegetables, fruit and weeds, his area looked like ranks of coffee tables dressed with snow and sprouting blocks of produce. But even the most curmudgeonly gardener could see that there was method in his madness. The paper suppresses weeds, holds in moisture and reflects light back up to the growing plants. By the end of the season, it had rotted into the ground. And his allotments were cared for. Last year he won the village Best Vegetable Garden prize, which he admits was 'a shock to all'. The stuff Adam grows is integral to his kitchen, and it does seem to me to be at the heart of all vegetable, herb and fruit growing to actually cook and eat the things. I wonder how many allotment holders cook and eat everything that they grow? I suspect that the polytunnel is where Adam is happiest. At 5am, he is busy in its pearly, cocooned light. The tunnel is warm. And very productive. Tomatoes, sweetcorn, lilies, squashes, cucumbers, peppers and huge onions ripen within the Mediterranean folds of the plastic. It smells fecund. But there are hints at a more conservative Yorkshire past. The onions are being grown as champion specimens 'as an experiment'. The sweetpeas are grown as cordons, producing a handful of perfect show flowers, 'just to try it out'. The melons, carrots and beans include Heritage seeds from the HDRA seed bank, grown to preserve the dying strains of rare vegetables that commerce has no use for. Outside, Adam works hard, but with an almost cavalier faith in his system. Inside the tunnel, the specialised and show plants receive hours of detailed care. This is remarkably similar to the rows of show dahlias and chrysanths of his neighbours, the runner beans selected for their extra length and plate of identical tomatoes chosen for the local flower show. I am writing from the priviliged position of one who has spent days with Adam on his allotment, but I suspect that deep in his horticultural heart, beneath the New Man qualifications, is a flat cap and a fiercely competitive instinct. This, I suspect, is what gets him out of bed at 5am on a rainy Sunday, almost as much as the chance to do something he loves in peace and quiet. I like allotments. I like this gardening in the open - slightly suspicious, slightly competitive, but uncloseted and generous. Wouldn't it be fantastic if more clubbers bought the easy communal generosity of the e-generation to local allotments? I suspect that the old boys, despite the odd mutter and funny look, would love it. My roots: A week in Monty's garden I got very dejected about our garden this week. Partly because I have got to go away next week (on holiday, good for the exhausted TV presenter/writer, but bad for the gardener in harvest time) and partly because there are times when you walk round the garden and suddenly see that it does not come up to your own standards. We all have an idealised picture of the garden that we have carried around in our heads from the moment it became ours and which is never the same as the growing reality. Over the years that the garden comes into being, that image carries you forward and inspires you, but when things reach maturity, the reality can be harsh. The other day, it seemed that this entire garden, in all its 13 different components, was unrealised, dull and wanting. So what to do? I started by doing what I always do in this position (it happens every year, about mid July), and spent a day in the vegetable garden. I removed every weed, sowed Hungarian rye grass as green manure, planted out cabbages and broccoli, planted a bed of radiccio (dozens of plants, but what the hell, they'll last most of the winter), transplanted the strawberry runners pegged into pots a month ago (all with good root systems), dug up a bed of Charlotte potatoes for storage and rotovated the ground, spent ages squashing caterpillars, and watered the lot. It was a start, and I felt better for it. The Jewel garden is still a disgrace, over-lush with flowers, undeadheaded and mildewy. I exaggerate, it is still lovely - but not lovely enough. We shall rationalise the planting this winter in the light of the weather that we are all having to cope with. Everything needs more space for ventilation and less feeding to reduce lush growth. I think the skill will be in creating an effect of lushness without crowded, sappy growth. Why have my tobacco plants grown so variably this year? Some are their usual fat-leafed selves, while others just feet away are puny, runtish things. But I suspect that when I dig them up I will find that the stunted ones have not got beyond their potbound rootball, and I am learning that the timing of potting on and planting out in relationship to an individual plant's root development is vital.

According to the gloomier forecasts, so would half the Football League.

      "bodyText": "Every time the football transfer record is broken the new fee is universally condemned as obscene, so why shed tears over European Commission instructions to Fifa to scrap what it holds to be an illegal system of retaining and transferring players who ought to enjoy complete freedom of movement? Surely the EC is doing football a big favour here, particularly as some of the seamier aspects of the modern game - agents agitating for transfers, for example, and the huge facilitation fees which surround big money deals - would be swept away at a stroke. According to the gloomier forecasts, so would half the Football League.

      "body": "<p>It has become almost a custom now for the Venice Film Festival to screen the latest Woody Allen movie out of competition, and this year they're showing his Small Time Crooks. The festival is also honouring Clint Eastwood with a 10-film retrospective that includes his latest picture, Space Cowboys, to accompany the special Lifetime Achievement Award which was presented to him at the opening ceremony last week.</p> <p> On the face of it they seem an incongruous pair; Allen, the short 64-year-old New York liberal, son of first generation Jews from Eastern Europe, and Eastwood, the tall (6ft 4ins), 70-year-old Californian conservative whose Wasp ancestry can be traced back to colonial days. Yet there's more that unites them than sets them apart. </p> <p>Both are autodidacts addicted to jazz, the clarinettist Allen being an aficionado of the hot New Orleans style, the pianist Eastwood preferring cool modern jazz. Both have had their sexual activities brutally exposed in the courts, attracting considerable public censure for their behaviour and their preference in their later years for women less than half their years. Most importantly, however, they are Hollywood's two greatest actor-directors since Chaplin, and have been major forces, entirely for the good, in a profligate, disorganised industry. They came after the cinema's old masters, but before the emergence of the film school movie-brats and each has stuck to his last. They've controlled their own careers, keeping a slight distance from Hollywood life, they invariably bring their films in under budget, and have produced large and serious bodies of work. </p> <p>Eastwood has romanticised his background a little, following an inverse-Gatsby syndrome of exaggerating the poverty he endured. He has claimed the blue-collar world of Oakland across the bay from San Francisco as the tough setting of his youth rather than the more genteel suburb of Piedmont where he was born. Neverthless, his lower-middle-class family was badly affected by the Depression, and the drifting life forced on his father and the sight of poverty around him clearly affected his ideas about thrift, hard work and self-reliance. </p> <p>His undistinguished schooldays and his military service as a swimming instructor were followed by a business course at Los Angeles City College. His lackadaisical studies were interrupted when he was spotted by a scout for Universal Studios and signed to a short-term contract. Though this was to change his life, it didn't turn out to be the immediate break it must have seemed. During those last days of the big studio system, Universal was churning out low-budget genre movies - westerns, SF fantasies, horror, broad comedies - for release as double-bills, and Eastwood got to appear in a dozen of them, all without distinction. As he later recalled: 'I'd always play the young lieutenant or the lab technician who came in and said, \"He went that way\", or \"Doctor, here are the X-rays\", and the doctor would say, \"Get lost, kid\". I'd go out and get lost and that would be that.' </p> <p>Universal didn't know what to do with this lanky, genial lad; and his voice was an uncertain instrument before it developed that deep, husky tone and the slow delivery, sometimes slightly skittish, in imitation, it's said, of Marilyn Monroe. But fortunately, just at the point that Eastwood was thinking of supporting himself and his wife by some more reliable means, he was noticed in 1959 by a producer in the MGM commmisary and introduced to Charles Marquis Warren, a former prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Scott Fitzgerald, who was about to launch the TV Western series, Rawhide. Eastwood was cast as the hero's quiet sidekick, which provided regular, lucrative work for the next seven years, but no proper offers from Hollywood. </p> <p>Then came the European invitation that truly changed Eastwood's life - to come to Europe and make the spaghetti western A Fistful of Dollars. The director was the unknown Sergio Leone, for whom Eastwood had been the fourth choice after James Coburn, Charles Bronson and Cliff Robertson. Two other Leone horse operas followed, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly , and this 'Dollar Trilogy' not only made Eastwood world famous but gave him a new, hard identity as the mysterious, laconic cheroot-chewing 'Man With No Name'. At last Hollywood took notice. In the late Sixties, offers flooded in, and immediately the shrewd actor created his own company, Malpaso, named for a parcel of land he'd bought near California's coastal Highway 1, and most of his subsequent films have been co-productions with Malpaso. </p> <p>At this point Eastwood had another stroke of luck, when he was searching for someone to direct him in Coogan's Bluff, the tale of an Arizona cop pursuing a criminal to New York. Universal recommended a pair of third-raters, Don Taylor and Alex Segal. The studio computer, conflating the two, came up with the name of Don Siegel, a cult director in Europe but unknown to Eastwood, who famously asked 'Who the hell is Don Siegel?' before deciding to view some of his pictures. </p> <p> A five-movie partnership followed, including the seminal Dirty Harry in 1971, a politically ambivalent populist work that captured the temper of the time but deeply divided the critics. His implacable enemy Pauline Kael wrote in the New Yorker that the 'action genre has always had fascist potential, and it has finally surfaced... Dirty Harry is a deeply immoral movie'. But Norman Mailer observed: 'The movie is almost as open in its space as a western. Maybe that's why the violence works... Dirty Harry looks as clean and well turned out as any young senator with a promising future. In scenes where we see him walking down the street he could be walking from one campaign spot to another. Eastwood knows the buried buttons in his audience as well as any film-maker around. Is it out of measure to call him the most important small-town artist in America?' </p> <p>The role of the maverick San Francisco cop Harry Callahan shaped the future screen persona of the 41-year-old Eastwood as indelibly as the role of the rancher Tom Dunson in Red River had shaped that of John Wayne when he too was 41. Siegel generously encouraged Eastwood to direct and himself played the hero's favourite bartender in the thriller Play Misty For Me (1971). This impressive debut features Eastwood as a womanising, jazz-loving disc jockey, one of the two or three occasions when he's come near to a self portrait. </p> <p>Over the years as their fame grew, Leone and Eastwood tended to disparage each other's work, but the actor had learnt a lot about pacing, camera positioning and mood from the Italian, as well as gaining confidence in his own physical presence. The relationship with the veteran Siegel, who'd arrived in Hollywood not long after Eastwood's birth, was like that of father and son, and their friendship and mutual respect continued up to Siegel's death nine years ago. Eastwood credited Siegel with teaching him how to tell a story economically in the classic manner of Walsh, Hawks and Curtiz, and how to prepare a movie so that time and money aren't wasted. </p> <p>Fame and money came to Eastwood in abundance in the late Sixties and early Seventies. But respect from critics and his fellow film-makers came only gradually. His politics, as evidenced through his films, his support of Ronald Reagan, his alleged financing of the search for American PoWs in South-east Asia, and his successful bid to become Republican mayor of Carmel in 1986, offended many on the Left. He was for years dismissed as an actor of limited means, though in fact like Robert Mitchum, he's a minimalist performer who knows just how to address the camera. </p> <p>He's also been accused of being a low-brow crowd-pleaser, though this charge can be brought against only a handful of his pictures, most notably Every Which Way But Loose (1978) and Any Which Way You Can (1980), neither directed by him, in which he plays a trucker and bareknuckle boxer accompanied everywhere by Clyde, an incontinent orang-utan. These two films seem like provocative gestures designed to affront respectable society; they stand at the opposite end of the spectrum from Bird, his fastidious cinebiography of Charlie Parker. </p> <p>Eastwood is in his manner and conduct neither pretentious nor boorish. He has a natural, relaxed, amused quality both on and off the screen. 'Clint Eastwood has an absolute fixation on an antihero,' Siegel told Peter Bogdanovich 30 years ago. 'It's his credo in life and in all the films he's done so far... I've never worked with an actor who was less concerned with his good image.' He is, of course, with that famous mole on his upper-lip, a warts-and-all man who doesn't have a good profile or wear a hair-piece. </p> <p>He still moves with grace and agility, but he's never tried to conceal his age or deny the ravages of time, which didn't prevent him taking a bath with Meryl Streep in The Bridges of Madison County or getting into bed with the young Laila Robins in True Crime. In Space Cowboys (which opens in Britain on 22 September) he does nothing to deny his advanced years. Along with the 72-year-old James Garner, the 65-year-old Donald Sutherland and the relatively youthful 54-year-old Tommy Lee Jones, he's one of a quartet of superannuated astronauts who never got into space and are brought out of retirement by Nasa for a special mission. In a scene that has united critics in their praise, the quartet line up naked for a medical, revealing every wrinkle of their scrawny bodies. </p> <p>From the time he attained power and independence, he's sought without any great beating of drums to push the cinema forward and to make thoughtful, popular pictures. </p> <p>Although he has been attacked for his parsimonious treatment of associates and employees, he's held a production team together for three decades, with virtually every movie since 1971 photographed by Bruce Surtees or Jack N. Green. He's encouraged young film-makers, giving Michael Cimino his first directing assignment on Thunderbolt and Lightfoot, and employing the debutant writer-director Richard Tuggle to make Tightrope in which Eastwood plays a deeply disturbed cop with a taste for bondage. Tightrope is a pro-feminist picture that set out to refute the charge of misogyny that has been brought against him, just as the second Dirty Harry movie, Magnum Force, took on the charge of fascism. His help has extended overseas as when, out of respect for Bertrand Tavernier and his admiration for saxophonist Dexter Gordon, the film's star, he used his influence to secure Warner Brothers' support for Tavernier's Round Midnight, a movie in which he had no financial interest. </p> <p>Proof of Eastwood's concern for his reputation is to be found in the fact that for many years he employed Pierre Rissient, the influential French cineaste and critic, to be his European adviser and low-key publicist. This has certainly helped ease his way in intellectual circles on the Continent and ultimately led to him being made a Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and presiding over the jury at the 1994 Cannes Festival, the year Catherine Deneuve, one of his numerous former lovers, was vice-president. </p> <p>In 1976 I had the opportunity to observe Eastwood's informality quite closely when he and I were among the film-makers, historians, sociologists and critics invited to take part in a bicentennial conference on 'The Western Movie and American Society' staged at Sun Valley, Idaho, by the US National Endowment of the Arts. He was there to present the world premiere of The Outlaw Josey Wales in a hall holding no more than 200 people, and he was accompanied by his co-star and then lover Sondra Locke, and the Indian actor Chief Dan George, but no bodyguard and no PR adviser. Over several days he spoke on panels, talked and socialised, taking a keen interest in the proceedings. He always listened intently to other speakers and only talked of strictly industrial matters when directly questioned. </p> <p> The Outlaw Josey Wales, one of his masterpieces, is an allegorical western, the real subject of which is the healing of America after the Vietnam War. Oddly enough, although his name is more closely associated with the genre than anyone alive, he's only made three westerns in the past 27 years - The Outlaw Josey Wales, Pale Rider (1985), which is a cross between Shane and his own High Plains Drifter, and Unforgiven (1992). They are like beacons in his career and milestone commentaries on the state of the nation by one of its iconic citizens. The dark, savage, complex Unforgiven is a majestic film that observes the tragedy and absurdity of life as it examines American history and mythology. It at last brought Eastwood the recognition he deserved in the form of Oscars for best film and best direction. He recognised his debts in the film's simple dedication - 'For Don and Sergio'. </p> <p><strong> Clinton Eastwood Jr</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> DoB:</strong> 31 May 1930, San Francisco, California </p> <p><strong> Educated:</strong> LA City College; Honorary Ph.D., Wesleyan University </p> <p><strong> Occupation:</strong> Actor, director, producer, musician, politician </p> <p><strong> Early TV: </strong> Rowdy Yates in Rawhide </p> <p><strong> Big Break:</strong> A Fistful of Dollars (1964) </p> <p><strong> Latest film:</strong> Space Cowboys </p> <p><strong> Married to:</strong> Dina Ruiz (one child, Morgan) </p> <p><strong> Other children:</strong> Kimber (with actress Roxanne Tunis); Kyle and Alison (with ex-wife Maggie Johnson); Francesca (with actress Frances Fisher)</p>",

It stars Billy Crudup and Anna Paquin and is based on Crowe's time as a teenage writer on Rolling Stone in the Seventies, when rock journalists could still pretend to be almost as cool as their subjects. (Hunter S. Thompson meets a kid on work experience was probably the pitch.) </p> <p>Last week, Serendipity, directed by Peter Chelsom, started filming in New York with Jeremy (Grosse Point Blank) Piven playing the part of a charming obituary writer who happens to be John Cusack's best mate. And, in the autumn, NBC is screening a new series called Deadline which centres on a newspaper columnist played by Tom Conti who, in between banging out columns, cracks the occasional murder. (Jonathan Creek meets Nigel Dempster). </p> <p>Staggeringly, hacks are also becoming fashionable in another sense of the word. The September issue of W magazine, just out in New York, has a 16-page spread with assorted journos dressed in Hilfiger cashmere and 'camel and fur by Lang'. Which makes a change, for you can count the number of conventionally well-dressed journalists on the fingers of one hand: Damon Runyon, Tom Wolfe, Nigel Dempster, James Whitaker. Or maybe you can't. </p> <p>This development is unwelcome for cinema-goers, television viewers and magazine readers, but far, far worse for journalists. During my career - no, that's too strong a word. Having been employed in a series of different but tangentially linked jobs, I have seen the damage a successful TV programme can wreak on a profession. When I spent a brief spell as a barrister, Rumpole of the Bailey was all the rage. (Yes, internet-users, a series about a fat brief who called his wife She Who Must Be Obeyed was must-see television). During a shorter spell as a solicitor, LA Law was the nation's preferred viewing. And during a too-long period I spent on the fringes of the comedy world, Ben Elton had his own series on television, telling bad jokes. </p> <p>The effect of television series on these professions was disquieting. Barristers, pretty odd at the sanest of times, became even stranger as they added Rumpolian mannerisms to their bag of tics. The solicitors went beserk: acquiring year-round perma-tans, putting in consecutive all-nighters and adopting Tony Blackburn accents. As for the comedians... well, anyone who has been to a comedy club knows they shouldn't be encouraged, but Elton's success led them to the deluded, but as it transpired, correct belief that they could be boring on any subject and make oodles of money. </p> <p>Now it's the journalists' turn. They would be unique if they didn't let all this media coverage go to their heads. Snazzily dressed, they will hesitantly move from the pub to the club. Once in through the front door they will swiftly move from club occasionals to club bores. At a stroke, working in a newspaper office will be akin to working with an office-full of Griff Rhys-Joneses. A savagely depressing thought and worse will follow. </p> <p>Thousands of people doing media studies courses - the fastest growing degree subject in the country - will ignore all the evidence accrued while completing their degrees, start believing instead in the movies and conclude that hackery is glamorous. Which means more recruits, which means more competition, which, in my experience, means... well, perhaps there's no need to be maudlin. </p> <p>There is a chance that it won't happen. Even though a magazine editor, while dismissing eight pitches with a prescient sentence, once told me, 'I've noticed trends come from America to this country, my advice is to look West for your ideas,' she can't be 100 per cent correct. Can she? </p> <p>I reckoned the best way of nipping this nonsense in the bud would be to approach it from the grooming angle. So I rang Dylan Jones, editor of GQ , to ask if it had ever even crossed his mind to do a fashion shoot featuring hacks. 'We did it six months ago with New York journalists. And we featured Tony Parsons as a fashion model a couple of months ago,' he said. In short, the horse had well and truly bolted. </p> <p>So, Dylan, are journalists sexy? 'I know a lot of sexy female journalists. I know no sexy male journalists.' Different worlds, magazines and newspapers. </p> <p>Over at Esquire , Peter Howarth takes a different line. Hack shoot? 'Absolutely not. If you knew the scuzzy bunch I know... Part of the art of journalism is that we produce these products and everyone thinks we're going for drinks with Brad Pitt. But we're not. We're unshaven people who don't see enough daylight.' Too true. Journalists abhor pub gardens. </p> <p>Are they sexy? 'I don't think so, I really don't think so. Every journalist I know likes to think he's sexy. He read Scoop or Fear and Loathing and thought journalism will be a bit of a laugh and... well, you know.' Indeed. </p> <p>The BBC is said to be on the verge of buying Deadline and screening it here in prime time next year, but there's no guarantee it'll be the next Lou Grant. And Almost Famous and Serendipity may not cause that many shakes either. The great movies about journalism - The Sweet Smell of Success, The Front Page, Ace in the Hole - were all set in the days when newspapermen wore hats. Or at least corduroy jackets (Robert Redford in All The President's Men). A more recent example is provided by Perfect . This intriguing Eighties movie starred John Travolta as a Rolling Stone journalist stalking a health and fitness expert played by Jamie Lee Curtis. After its release Curtis's career took off and there was a health club boom. In contrast, after playing the part of a hack, Travolta didn't get a decent part for a decade and Rolling Stone went into terminal decline. </p> <p>The film flopped in part due to a critical panning. And those who seek to make journalists sexy should be aware that their biggest obstacle will be the journalists themselves. Barely a day goes by without a hack lamenting the passing of the days when Fleet Street was Fleet Street and a talented writer could file a thousand-word think-piece through to copy without, in the slightest, disrupting a four-bottle lunch. </p> <p>These pieces proliferate in part because the hacks are struggling to conjure up copy but in the main because it is in all their interests to maintain the illusion that journalism is no fun any more and thereby help maintain the closed shop. </p> <p>It's a scrubby, under-paid, unfashionable profession, as any journalist will tell you. Before waddling up to the bar, ordering a round, waddling back and having a very good laugh.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Piranha to Scurfy and Other Stories</strong><br>Ruth Rendell<br>Hutchinson \u00a315.99, pp248</p> <p>Ruth Rendell's seventh collection of short stories demonstrates both her strengths as a writer and the limitations of the form. The best pieces here are the longest, two novellas that deal with obsession - a common theme of her work - and show her unequalled ability to build and sustain suspense. </p> <p>In High Mysterious Union, the main character is obsessed with a young woman who loves him but not exclusively. Recovering from a breakdown after his wife left him, Ben goes to stay in a quiet village that he soon discovers is a kind of erotic dream world. Initially he is welcomed, but his total misunderstanding of how the village works soon turns everyone against him. </p> <p>Rendell's sense of place is acute and her ability to make simple incidents - a group of villagers staring, the sight of all the houses in the village brightly illuminated - threatening and fearful is quite remarkable. Ben is a translator, working on a Jungian analysis of the stories attendant on the Trojan War (especially those surrounding Helen of Troy and Paris, Priam and Hecabe) so there are echoes of classical mythology here. The evocation of a mysterious, enclosed world is also vaguely reminiscent of John Fowles's The Ebony Tower or its precursor, Alain-Fournier's Le Grand Meaulnes.</p> <p>The best of the collection is the title story, more horror than crime story, redolent of M. R. James. Ambrose Ribbon is another obsessive. He lives alone in a house he used to share with his dead mother. He keeps her room exactly as she left it, her pink nightdress folded on the bed. The title of the story refers to Volume VIII of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, a book he associates with her.</p> <p>It is a book he uses in his self-appointed task. His obsession is to spend his every waking hour reading novels, though not for pleasure. He checks them for errors of fact and grammar, errors he communicates to the authors in rude letters. However, one book, Demogorgon, a horror novel by best-selling author Kingston Marle, has an extreme effect on him. The demon in the story enters his life. Once again Rendell builds up the suspense by a subtle accretion of detail. As Ribbon's torments increase, Rendell's rendering of his fragmenting personality brilliantly done. </p> <p>The shorter pieces are, perhaps inevitably, less weighty and suffer from a weakness of the form. Where the short story generally has a flexibility which allows it to present itself pretty much on its own terms - often allusive, atonal or fragmentary - the crime story needs to fulfil genre expectations, especially when it comes to the d\u00e9nouement. Hence the ubiquitous twist ending, so hard to do well in the limited confines of the short story without the reader seeing it coming. </p> <p>The nine short pieces - between six and 12 pages in length - are entertaining enough but only one, The Wink, has any deeper resonance. Its account of a woman coming to terms many decades after the event with a youthful violation is powerful stuff.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Piranha to Scurfy and Other Stories Ruth Rendell Hutchinson \u00a315.99, pp248 Ruth Rendell's seventh collection of short stories demonstrates both her strengths as a writer and the limitations of the form. The best pieces here are the longest, two novellas that deal with obsession - a common theme of her work - and show her unequalled ability to build and sustain suspense. In High Mysterious Union, the main character is obsessed with a young woman who loves him but not exclusively. Recovering from a breakdown after his wife left him, Ben goes to stay in a quiet village that he soon discovers is a kind of erotic dream world. Initially he is welcomed, but his total misunderstanding of how the village works soon turns everyone against him. Rendell's sense of place is acute and her ability to make simple incidents - a group of villagers staring, the sight of all the houses in the village brightly illuminated - threatening and fearful is quite remarkable. Ben is a translator, working on a Jungian analysis of the stories attendant on the Trojan War (especially those surrounding Helen of Troy and Paris, Priam and Hecabe) so there are echoes of classical mythology here. The evocation of a mysterious, enclosed world is also vaguely reminiscent of John Fowles's The Ebony Tower or its precursor, Alain-Fournier's Le Grand Meaulnes. The best of the collection is the title story, more horror than crime story, redolent of M. R. James. Ambrose Ribbon is another obsessive. He lives alone in a house he used to share with his dead mother. He keeps her room exactly as she left it, her pink nightdress folded on the bed. The title of the story refers to Volume VIII of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, a book he associates with her. It is a book he uses in his self-appointed task. His obsession is to spend his every waking hour reading novels, though not for pleasure. He checks them for errors of fact and grammar, errors he communicates to the authors in rude letters. However, one book, Demogorgon, a horror novel by best-selling author Kingston Marle, has an extreme effect on him. The demon in the story enters his life. Once again Rendell builds up the suspense by a subtle accretion of detail. As Ribbon's torments increase, Rendell's rendering of his fragmenting personality brilliantly done. The shorter pieces are, perhaps inevitably, less weighty and suffer from a weakness of the form. Where the short story generally has a flexibility which allows it to present itself pretty much on its own terms - often allusive, atonal or fragmentary - the crime story needs to fulfil genre expectations, especially when it comes to the d\u00e9nouement. Hence the ubiquitous twist ending, so hard to do well in the limited confines of the short story without the reader seeing it coming. The nine short pieces - between six and 12 pages in length - are entertaining enough but only one, The Wink, has any deeper resonance. Its account of a woman coming to terms many decades after the event with a youthful violation is powerful stuff.",

      "byline": "Kate Kellaway",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Yasmina Reza was five when she discovered she was not going to live for ever. 'I thought it was a piece of luck to be alive, a kind of distinction - like a medal. I thought: if life is only a short piece of time, I must live with intensity.' Was she frightened of death? 'No. Not at all.' (She is emphatic: 'No. Not at all' is an absolute and her catchphrase). At eight, she wrote a poem about mortality. It was called 'La Mort et La Vie' and it won a 'little prize'. Could she still remember how it went? 'Of course,' she said in that indignant way - between reassurance and reproof - that French women have. </p> <p>We were sitting in Brasserie Lipp on the Boulevard St Germain, in Paris. On the wall alongside us was a tiled, tropical landscape of pastel cockatoos and parrots. Faded signs warned 'amateurs du pipe' to keep their tobacco to themselves. Reza reeled off her poem at speed; I followed after, dragging my schoolgirl French behind me. Life, according to the authoritative eight-year-old, was full of le bonheur and le malheur - the rest I asked her to write down. 'En subissant l'heure et la peur,/ plus tard la vie s'efface/ et l'ame part,/ en haut dans l'espace.' (Roughly: Undergoing time and fear/ life later will disappear/ and the soul part/ high up in space.) </p> <p>Now, at 40, not much has changed. Reza has returned to matters of life and death. Not that there is anything moribund about her career. She is about to enjoy a sparkling English season. Her play Conversations After a Burial, starring Claire Bloom, opens at the Almeida theatre and her autobiographical novel Hammerklavier, in part a memoir of her father, is published at the same time (Faber \u00a36.99). She is best known for Art, the intellectually chic comedy about three men who fall out over a white painting, although their quarrel is actually about friendship. Art 's success has been phenomenal; it has been translated into 35 languages and the trio can still be heard arguing in the West End every night. </p> <p>Reza has described time as 'the only subject'. She was absolutely punctual herself, thrifty about her own time. We almost collided in the entrance to the restaurant. I recognised her from photographs: dark, petite, with a slightly cross face, a sensual, contemptuous mouth, a bustling air. She removed her dark glasses to reveal lively brown eyes under elaborately curved brows. She is not strictly beautiful but has a simian intensity. She was severely dressed - apart from a skirt with a flirtatiously feathered hem - a business-like princess, with no necklace. </p> <p>Her appearance matters to her greatly. In one of the most memorable chapters of Hammerklavier, Reza describes the purchase of a midnight-blue satin suit with thin grey stripes. She bought it to attend an awards ceremony at the Savoy in London (where she was to pick up a prize for Art ). She was pleased with the suit: 'Restrained... understated elegance, slightly masculine, which is good for an author at lunchtime.' Then she blew it. She bought a necklace: two strings of costume pearls, one of which she converted into a bracelet. She knew the pearls were a mistake but asked her friend Serge (an extraordinary number of male characters in Reza's oeuvre end up being called Serge) to give his honest opinion of her jewellery. He judged the necklace 'dreadful' and the bracelet 'even worse'. She ended their conversation: 'You're right, but from now on we are no longer friends.' </p> <p>In real life, the conversation ended in laughter. She is still friends with Serge. She never wears the necklace. So why was she tempted to invent such an extreme ending? Friendship is a delicate business, it seems. The necklace incident recalls Art where a friendship is also jeopardised by an aesthetic difference of opinion. Should the white canvas and the costume pearls be insincerely praised? Is deception necessary to friendship? 'No. Not at all. It is not a question of lying. It is a question of manner.' It is style that counts. </p> <p>This may be true for Reza in more ways than one. Later, she concedes that lying may sometimes be necessary even though friendships must be founded in trust. She has a sort of tricky integrity, admirable in its way. She does not care if her friends hold unsympathetic opinions about art or politics, it is 'the moral differences' that count. She adds a sober PS: 'Real friendship is very rare.' </p> <p>Reza's father was her real friend. He was her axis: all her work turns on him in some way. As a child, she hardly knew him. Her parents were worldly. 'I first \"met\" my father when I was a teenager. I got to know him well in my twenties.' He was an engineer of bridges, then a businessman. He was also an amateur musician who played the piano badly but with passion (Reza plays too). He was a Persian Jew, born in Moscow. Reza's mother is Jewish, too, from Budapest. She is a violinist (Reza allows her mother one adjective: 'strong.') Reza believes her writing is more Jewish than French. But she worships French, adores its 'subtlety'. She has no time for English, dismissing it as if it were a flat cake that could never rise. </p> <p>Conversations After a Burial is about the relationship between sex and death. It is, like most of her plays, beautifully translated by Christopher Hampton. A man and a woman make love on the dead man's grave - an act that does not prove as private as they might have wished. As the rest of the mourners gather round a mighty pot au feu, there is more than leeks and carrots coming to the boil. </p> <p>You could be forgiven for assuming that Conversations After a Burial must have been written just after her father's death. But it is her first play, written 15 years ago, and her father knew it well. It was in the Brasserie Lipp that she handed him a published copy of the play. Later, walking home with him they ran, by chance, into Raymond Barre, a former French Prime Minister. Her father waylaid Barre - to her chagrin - and boasted about his daughter's talent.

I am very savage. That is why I can have a private life.' She has two children: a girl, 12, and a boy, seven, by her partner, the film-maker Didier Martigny. The boy minds most about her absences. He advises her on her wardrobe, alerting her when one colour does not get on with another. It was 'wonderful', she said, to have a son.

      "bodyText": "Yasmina Reza was five when she discovered she was not going to live for ever. 'I thought it was a piece of luck to be alive, a kind of distinction - like a medal. I thought: if life is only a short piece of time, I must live with intensity.' Was she frightened of death? 'No. Not at all.' (She is emphatic: 'No. Not at all' is an absolute and her catchphrase). At eight, she wrote a poem about mortality. It was called 'La Mort et La Vie' and it won a 'little prize'. Could she still remember how it went? 'Of course,' she said in that indignant way - between reassurance and reproof - that French women have. We were sitting in Brasserie Lipp on the Boulevard St Germain, in Paris. On the wall alongside us was a tiled, tropical landscape of pastel cockatoos and parrots. Faded signs warned 'amateurs du pipe' to keep their tobacco to themselves. Reza reeled off her poem at speed; I followed after, dragging my schoolgirl French behind me. Life, according to the authoritative eight-year-old, was full of le bonheur and le malheur - the rest I asked her to write down. 'En subissant l'heure et la peur,/ plus tard la vie s'efface/ et l'ame part,/ en haut dans l'espace.' (Roughly: Undergoing time and fear/ life later will disappear/ and the soul part/ high up in space.) Now, at 40, not much has changed. Reza has returned to matters of life and death. Not that there is anything moribund about her career. She is about to enjoy a sparkling English season. Her play Conversations After a Burial, starring Claire Bloom, opens at the Almeida theatre and her autobiographical novel Hammerklavier, in part a memoir of her father, is published at the same time (Faber \u00a36.99). She is best known for Art, the intellectually chic comedy about three men who fall out over a white painting, although their quarrel is actually about friendship. Art 's success has been phenomenal; it has been translated into 35 languages and the trio can still be heard arguing in the West End every night. Reza has described time as 'the only subject'. She was absolutely punctual herself, thrifty about her own time. We almost collided in the entrance to the restaurant. I recognised her from photographs: dark, petite, with a slightly cross face, a sensual, contemptuous mouth, a bustling air. She removed her dark glasses to reveal lively brown eyes under elaborately curved brows. She is not strictly beautiful but has a simian intensity. She was severely dressed - apart from a skirt with a flirtatiously feathered hem - a business-like princess, with no necklace. Her appearance matters to her greatly. In one of the most memorable chapters of Hammerklavier, Reza describes the purchase of a midnight-blue satin suit with thin grey stripes. She bought it to attend an awards ceremony at the Savoy in London (where she was to pick up a prize for Art ). She was pleased with the suit: 'Restrained... understated elegance, slightly masculine, which is good for an author at lunchtime.' Then she blew it. She bought a necklace: two strings of costume pearls, one of which she converted into a bracelet. She knew the pearls were a mistake but asked her friend Serge (an extraordinary number of male characters in Reza's oeuvre end up being called Serge) to give his honest opinion of her jewellery. He judged the necklace 'dreadful' and the bracelet 'even worse'. She ended their conversation: 'You're right, but from now on we are no longer friends.' In real life, the conversation ended in laughter. She is still friends with Serge. She never wears the necklace. So why was she tempted to invent such an extreme ending? Friendship is a delicate business, it seems. The necklace incident recalls Art where a friendship is also jeopardised by an aesthetic difference of opinion. Should the white canvas and the costume pearls be insincerely praised? Is deception necessary to friendship? 'No. Not at all. It is not a question of lying. It is a question of manner.' It is style that counts. This may be true for Reza in more ways than one. Later, she concedes that lying may sometimes be necessary even though friendships must be founded in trust. She has a sort of tricky integrity, admirable in its way. She does not care if her friends hold unsympathetic opinions about art or politics, it is 'the moral differences' that count. She adds a sober PS: 'Real friendship is very rare.' Reza's father was her real friend. He was her axis: all her work turns on him in some way. As a child, she hardly knew him. Her parents were worldly. 'I first \"met\" my father when I was a teenager. I got to know him well in my twenties.' He was an engineer of bridges, then a businessman. He was also an amateur musician who played the piano badly but with passion (Reza plays too). He was a Persian Jew, born in Moscow. Reza's mother is Jewish, too, from Budapest. She is a violinist (Reza allows her mother one adjective: 'strong.') Reza believes her writing is more Jewish than French. But she worships French, adores its 'subtlety'. She has no time for English, dismissing it as if it were a flat cake that could never rise. Conversations After a Burial is about the relationship between sex and death. It is, like most of her plays, beautifully translated by Christopher Hampton. A man and a woman make love on the dead man's grave - an act that does not prove as private as they might have wished. As the rest of the mourners gather round a mighty pot au feu, there is more than leeks and carrots coming to the boil. You could be forgiven for assuming that Conversations After a Burial must have been written just after her father's death. But it is her first play, written 15 years ago, and her father knew it well. It was in the Brasserie Lipp that she handed him a published copy of the play. Later, walking home with him they ran, by chance, into Raymond Barre, a former French Prime Minister. Her father waylaid Barre - to her chagrin - and boasted about his daughter's talent. Not that he had been convinced of it himself, at first. It was only when audiences hailed her that he changed his tune. He never saw Art. It was written in six weeks to distract her from his death. She believed the play was dreadful - 'not worthy of me' or of him. She wrote Hammerklavier for herself. Writing was a way of keeping her father alive on paper. She was talked into publishing it.

The stories feature Stalin's daughter living in Cambridge; a committee of MPs in Prague and Rome; a middle-class couple rising up the property ladder; a strange relationship with the internet; the odd life of an adopted daughter. Each story reveals some twist or turn that satisfyingly unifies. The metaphysical dimension is earthed by compellingly accurate details of the worlds involved. Characters are depicted vividly, descriptions are spare and taut. One of these stories, 'Dead Languages', was included in the recently published Oxford Book of English Short Stories. Each story demands concentration: this is a collection of extraordinary power.",

A nervous, humorous, strong-featured girl, she never liked her looks, and found it difficult to trust people, including her parents, the highly strung Kay, and pedantic O.B. Despite the curious family penchant for wild food fights and crockery smashing, which Dusty was to carry on, the O'Briens were never exactly touchy-feely. Many years on, when Kay was dying from cancer, she reached out to her daughter, seemingly for an embrace, but settled for roughly pinching her nose. </p> <p>Of all the riveting facts in Penny Valentine and Vicki Wickham's affectionate yet candid biography, this one makes you wince the most. There are pivotal moments in everyone's life that seem to explain all that came before, and all that came after, and expecting a rare embrace but getting your nose yanked seemed quintessentially Dusty. </p> <p>Certainly, it goes some way towards explaining the lethargy, paranoia, and drink and drug-soaked self-destruction that blighted her later years. It also explains the many masks Dusty felt she needed to hide behind in order to survive. Throughout her life, she seemed to operate on two levels - both as a real person and her own brilliant invention. The platinum blonde who was actually a brunette. The nation's sweetheart who was actually a lesbian. The sex symbol who felt unfeminine. The happy-go-lucky prankster who tormented herself with self-doubt, but privately confided in a lover that she never felt a moment of joy unless she was on stage. </p> <p>In the beginning, Dusty was the 'Sixties golden girl' - a young woman with rare talent and drive, who was never going to be content to be just another miniskirt on the Ready, Steady, Go podium. First with The Springfields, alongside her brother, Tom (whose real name was Dion), and then as a solo artist, Dusty enjoyed a stream of hits, including 'I Only Want To Be With You', and 'You Don't Have To Say You Love Me' and 'Son of a Preacher Man'. Her 1969 album, Dusty In Memphis, didn't sell as well as her previous releases, but remains a critical benchmark, and deservedly so. </p> <p>In terms of emotional clarity, Dusty's voice was incomparable - the equivalent of leaving a smog-bound city, climbing to the top of a mountain and breathing in sharp, cold, pure air for the first time. She was a grafter too. Not only did Dusty make it her business to know her chosen music (soul, r&amp;b and Motown), inside out, she worked at her own vocal integrity with a focus and passion that left even such noted perfectionists as the songwriters Burt Bacharach and Carole King flabbergasted. </p> <p>On a personal level, Dusty was less a blonde bombshell than she was a time bomb waiting to explode. She was not lacking in moral fibre - forever in thrall to black artists such as Marvin Gaye and Aretha Franklin, she made a courageous, unprecedented stand against apartheid on an early tour of South Africa. </p> <p>However, this lapsed Catholic from Ealing could never quite bring herself to come out publicly as a lesbian, even after she was heralded as a gay icon, even after her friends Elton John and the tennis player Billie Jean King had come out. When Dusty finally mustered the courage to tell her parents about her sexual persuasion, she was devastated by their refusal to take her seriously. It must have seemed like a rejection, another 'tweak of the nose', when what she really needed was an embrace or some other form of parental absolution. </p> <p>Dusty's chaotic, unproductive 12-year sojourn in America could only have underlined her feelings of worthlessness. Broke, lazy, sullen, uninspired, unreliable, exasperating, and raddled by booze and drugs, frankly, La Springfield sounds like she was a royal pain in the butt during this period. Of course, beneath it all, she was simply succumbing to the neurotic self-doubt and feelings of isolation that had dogged her since early childhood. At her lowest ebb, Dusty even took to taking overdoses, cutting herself, then signing into mental institutions - partly, her friends feel, because she came to the conclusion that they were the next best things to hotels. </p> <p>Valentine, a leading music journalist and broadcaster in the Sixties, and Wickham, Dusty's longtime manager, detail these events, and all others, with remarkable candour and honesty, yet never stray into exploitative, censorious waters. Both friends of Dusty's, they seem equally at pains to bring across the singer's best qualities - her kindness, generosity, and wicked sense of humour, which remained in evidence even during her harrowing battle against illness. </p> <p>Terminal cancer struck just as Dusty was enjoying a career resurgence aided by her admirers, the Pet Shop Boys. But, ever the consummate drama queen, she seemed determined to go out in style. Dusty summoned her hairdresser to the Royal Marsden to give her one last bleaching session, declaring: 'Now I can have an open coffin.' When an OBE turned up at the hospital, she asked drily:'Isn't this what they give to cleaners?' </p> <p>All of which explains why, as much as Dusty frequently perplexed and exasperated those closest to her, including the authors of this book, they, like her loyal public, could never quite bring themselves to give up on her.</p>",

Dean King is one of that devoted band of enthusiasts who elevated O'Brian, not long before his death, to an almost unprecedented pinnacle of literary success. In America, bumper stickers, a cookbook and Charlton Heston promoted his fame; here, the British Library honoured a living author for the first time ever by publishing a bibliography of his work. </p> <p>King is by no means blind to his subject's personal faults. I suppose the wind was rather taken out of his sails during the writing of his book when there appeared in the press the queer story of O'Brian's false identity. As we all know by now, O'Brian was not the sea-going, Gaelic-speaking Irishman he claimed to be, but was the land-lubberly Buckinghamshire-born son of a physician named Russ, of part-German descent. </p> <p>King deals sensibly with these harmless peccadillos. They were probably partly the natural instinct of a fiction writer to dramatise himself, and partly the reflection of a confused and often unhappy childhood. O'Brian lost his mother when he was three years old, and was never close to his father. The rest of his family was an interesting and often talented assembly of characters, but he seems to have had a floundering sort of upbringing. No wonder he decided to make himself a Celt from the Atlantic shore, and distance himself from his siblings. </p> <p>The life of innocent deceit takes on a profounder meaning, though, when one remembers that in 1940, O'Brian abandoned his wife, their three-year-old son and a handicapped baby, and went off with Mary Tolstoy, already the mother of the future writer Nicholas Tolstoy. This act of betrayal is perhaps a more real reason for O'Brian's reluctance to talk about his early life. To judge by this book it was his only cause for shame, and his affair with Mary matured over the years into a long, happy and honourable marriage. </p> <p>Still, the episode probably tainted O'Brian's days, and as we watch him grow older in the pages of this book, his deliberately fostered self-mystery becomes less engaging. He lived for nearly half a century in bohemian semi-reclusion with Mary in the Roussillon village of Collioure, but in his last years, when he was rich and famous, he acquired another personality again. He became a London clubman, an Establishment figure, feted by dukes and celebrities and honoured by the Queen; and this last denouement, however innocuous, somehow makes one doubt the essential integrity of the man. </p> <p>King's telling of the puzzling tale is decent, fair and extremely thorough, but often ingenuous. There was no Australian Embassy in 1929; there never has been such a thing as 'England's Air Force'; the Basque country is not the same as Catalonia, as page 168 seems to imply. Who cares that, on a journey in France: 'Patrick revved the engine of the little 2CV to pass slow-moving traffic on the winding two-lane roads'? Too much of the book consists of quotations from reviews - one wonders how much even O'Brian himself, who was very sensitive to reviews, cared about opinions expressed in the Housewife, the Chatanooga Times or New Zealand's Taranaki Herald. </p> <p>On the other hand, it is salutary to be reminded how highly respected O'Brian was as a novelist, short-story writer and biographer long before we had heard of Captain Aubrey and Dr Maturin, and to learn how intricately his personal experiences were woven into his novels. For of course it is as a writer that O'Brian must finally be judged, and Dean has made clear to me, I believe, why it is that I never thought of him in Tolstoyan terms. </p> <p>It might well be argued that if the 20 volumes of the Aubrey-Maturin cycle were to be telescoped into one book, it really would rival War and Peace as a supremely grand historical novel. O'Brian's attention to detail is astonishing, his invention never flags, his characters are rounded, his plots are compelling and he is often wonderfully merry. His saga ranges the world through many years of history, and his prose can be beautiful. </p> <p>Why, then, does his work not give me the ultimate frisson I get when I feel I am in the presence of creative greatness, and which constantly moves me as I read the pages of Leo Tolstoy? I think it is because in Tolstoy I know I am confronting fundamental truths, expressed in fiction that has grown organically out of human life, out of history, and out of the author's heart.

In the eighteenth century the dictionary was often seen as the essential bastion against the Visigoths of linguistic innovation.

Confronted by the challenge of online publishing and the cornucopia of new sources from press, television, radio, video, advertising and popular culture, contemporary lexicographers have been forced to admit that the contemporary dictionary is bound to be normative. The New Penguin English Dictionary mirrors this precisely. Where, in the past, such a volume from an established publisher would emphasise its gravitas and comprehensiveness, the New Penguin has taken a tab of ecstasy and is heading off to a rave. It invokes the Devil and announces in the accompanying blurb that it's 'a dictionary with attitude'. </p> <p>This attitude is defiantly hip and belligerently contemporary. The New Penguin' s publisher, who reads as though he is recovering from the hangover of a lifetime, announces that the English language that interests him is \"Ali G's English as well as the Queen's\". On closer scrutiny, 'Ali G's English' turns out to be rather less vivid than Mr G himself and to consist very largely of modish formulations from the world of dotcom yuppies, terms like 'quantoid' (somebody who is very enthusiastic about statistics), snakehead (a member of a Chinese gang involved in smuggling illegal immigrants), shedload (a large amount) and page-jacking (the process of diverting internet users from a website). </p> <p>The New Penguin is also a child of its time in supplying definitions for 'ladette', 'pashmina', 'WAP', 'Blairism' and 'yettie'. Despite its avowed aim of reflecting 'how people really use language today' it omits my two current favourite Americanisms 'bo-bo' (bourgeois bohemian) and 'bogsat' (bunch of guys sitting around and talking), but never mind. How many of these late twentieth-century linguistic novelties will survive is anyone's guess, but the new technology will enable such references to be silently replaced by new coinages as they occur. The New Penguin will no doubt sell in 'shedloads' to the dotcom generation, but it will probably seem rather dated by the year 2005. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk\">robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Confronted by the challenge of online publishing and the cornucopia of new sources from press, television, radio, video, advertising and popular culture, contemporary lexicographers have been forced to admit that the contemporary dictionary is bound to be normative. The New Penguin English Dictionary mirrors this precisely. Where, in the past, such a volume from an established publisher would emphasise its gravitas and comprehensiveness, the New Penguin has taken a tab of ecstasy and is heading off to a rave. It invokes the Devil and announces in the accompanying blurb that it's 'a dictionary with attitude'. This attitude is defiantly hip and belligerently contemporary. The New Penguin' s publisher, who reads as though he is recovering from the hangover of a lifetime, announces that the English language that interests him is \"Ali G's English as well as the Queen's\". On closer scrutiny, 'Ali G's English' turns out to be rather less vivid than Mr G himself and to consist very largely of modish formulations from the world of dotcom yuppies, terms like 'quantoid' (somebody who is very enthusiastic about statistics), snakehead (a member of a Chinese gang involved in smuggling illegal immigrants), shedload (a large amount) and page-jacking (the process of diverting internet users from a website). The New Penguin is also a child of its time in supplying definitions for 'ladette', 'pashmina', 'WAP', 'Blairism' and 'yettie'. Despite its avowed aim of reflecting 'how people really use language today' it omits my two current favourite Americanisms 'bo-bo' (bourgeois bohemian) and 'bogsat' (bunch of guys sitting around and talking), but never mind. How many of these late twentieth-century linguistic novelties will survive is anyone's guess, but the new technology will enable such references to be silently replaced by new coinages as they occur. The New Penguin will no doubt sell in 'shedloads' to the dotcom generation, but it will probably seem rather dated by the year 2005. robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk",

Yes, it is perfectly true that a lot of people got very cross when Casson wouldn't back the great exhibition on his predecessor as president, the architect Edwin Lutyens, that ended up at the Hayward Gallery instead of the RA which would have been its natural home.

Manser, who was herself present at the dinner afterwards, describes Casson as playing the peacemaker between a clearly cross Norman Foster and the prince. </p> <p>And yet she seems oblivious to the fact that it was Casson himself who was more responsible for the entire outburst than anyone.

He sees a strain of totalitarianism running through particular dehumanised philosophies of engineering and design and management; sees the potential for dictatorship in the absence of democracy engendered by the colossal power of corporations. Set this against the credible notion that 'for the talented and ambitious the future means work, not play' (there is no place in Eden-Olympia for those who are 'not net contributors to society: poets, traffic wardens, ecologists...') and what you come up with is a place that is 'very civilised and very corrupt. Once you are there, they look after you for ever'. A place, too, that in this compelling novel is never made to seem not very far from our own front doors.",

It is the first time the Government has officially advised teachers to tackle abortion as part of standard sex education and offered guidelines on how to do so. The guidelines emphasise that, while respecting the religious convictions of pupils and parents, teachers must accept that pregnant girls 'need to know how to access relevant agencies if necessary'. Both pro-life and pro-choice campaigners agree that the term 'relevant agencies' refers to abortion clinics. The document also says that, while aiming to reduce the number of unwanted teenage pregnancies among students, teachers should encourage students to consider the benefits of abortion if pregnancy does occur. Pro-life groups are enraged by the campaign, launched after a report found the pregnancy rate among British girls aged 15 to 19 is the highest in Europe, and still rising. At 6 per cent, the British rate of teenage pregnancy is twice that of Germany's, three times the rate in France and six times that of the Netherlands. Only Canada, New Zealand and the United States have higher rates. But according to pro-life campaigners, the document, to be read by all head teachers, teachers and school governors, endorses under-age sex and fails to suggest any alternative to unwanted pregnancies other than abortion.

'The Government is losing the plot on the abortion issue: the figures speak for themselves.' Quintavalle believes helping pregnant girls abort their babies rather than focusing on prevention will only exacerbate the problem of teenage pregnancy. 'How can young people see that underage sex is wrong when they're getting the message in the classroom that underage pregnancies can be sorted out?' she asked. More than 90,000 teenagers in England fall pregnant each year - 8,000 of them under 16 - and 38 per cent of such pregnancies were terminated in 1998 - almost 39,000 abortions. The Government hopes the guidelines will protect children from the 'inappropriate teaching and materials' circulating in some schools which oppose abortion. But Paul Tully, general secretary of the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, anticipates an outcry once teachers realise what they are being urged to do. 'These new guidelines are incredibly disturbing,' he said. 'The only explicit references made are to abortion and that's a great concern.

The guidelines were welcomed by pro-choice groups, but many believe they do not go far enough. 'Schools need to feel confident that they can provide information to help young people to understand the options open to them but the cowardly way it is dealt with in this document has obviously been influenced by people who will never regard abortion as a positive choice,' said Anne Weyman, chief executive of the Family Planning Association.

As headteacher at Fir Vale Secondary School in Sheffield he has managed to squeeze enough improvement out of his most able children to save his local MP from extreme embarrassment. His was the only school in the Government's flagship Fresh Start scheme for failing schools to show any real rise in its GSCE results last week, and that by just a tiny margin. </p> <p>This weekend Howe was understandably defensive of the Fresh Start scheme, by which failing schools are closed down and reborn with new headteachers, new management and a new name. 'The situation in schools like ours is very complex and needs to be managed with sensitivity. I won't comment on the other schools, but the reason we are bucking the trend is that we have established partnerships, working very closely with other schools, the local authority and benefiting from the strong leadership of the governors.' </p> <p>He was fortunate. Torsten Friedag, the superhead at London's flagship Islington Arts and Media School, who resigned earlier this year after just months in the job, found himself caught between some hostile left-wing governors opposed to New Labour's education policy and a Lib-Dem controlled local authority that wouldn't release the money he needed. The experienced heads at Firfield Community School in Newcastle and East Brighton College of Media Arts found themselves in similarly impossible positions before they threw in the towel. </p> <p>The rash of summer stories about ever-increasing numbers of exam passes at GCSE and A level, the news that girls were outperforming boys across the board and the Laura Spence affair over elitism at Oxford all concentrated on the children at the top of the pile. Last week's evidence that the Fresh Start scheme is in meltdown was a salutary wake-up call to a government obsessed with education. At Firfield, only 4 per cent of pupils scored five or more GCSEs at A*-C grades and at East Brighton College the proportion fell from 20 to 13 per cent. At Islington Arts and Media School, where Tony Blair's special adviser on education was on the appointment panel for Friedag, only four pupils managed to achieve a total of five results in the top three grades. </p> <p>Howe, a determined character who worked in tough inner-city schools in the West Midlands before moving to Sheffield, knows that he is only one bad year away from failure. When you are near the bottom of the league tables, a handful of able children can make a difference of several percentage points. He had therefore unashamedly concentrated on the children capable of boosting the figures and attracting more children to the school who can do the same. </p> <p>'We have a large proportion of youngsters for whom English is their second language and while we are still undersubscribed we are still vulnerable to refugees coming in to the school who inevitably depress the results.' </p> <p>One of his major achievements is that this year's intake and classes now moving into the second year are full and no longer open to new arrivals excluded from other schools or asylum seekers who have just arrived in the country. Howe doesn't buy the idea that the success of his school will simply create a sink school elsewhere in the city. 'The secondary schools in this part of Sheffield have always had a tough ride. The real problem is that pupils have to catch a bus to the other side of the city after the age of 16 because there are no sixth-forms.' </p> <p>Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, has been at the centre of the debate over failing schools since he took up the case of teachers at the ill-fated Ridings school in Calderdale, which was forced to close after children rioted. He believes Blunkett is genuine in his wish to tackle underachievement, but not prepared to put his money where his mouth is. 'There is nothing magic about this, you need a brilliant head and brilliant staff and lots of them. In these sorts of schools you need class sizes of about 10 pupils, to treble the number of staff and pay them premium salaries. They are just not prepared to face up to the cost and so they turn to privatisation.' </p> <p>The symbolic importance of Fir Vale cannot be underestimated. The school - the name was changed from Earl Marshall two years ago - is right in Blunkett's backyard, bang next door to his Brightside constituency. Quite properly, the Secretary of State has been one of the school's most high-profile supporters, happy to be photographed laughing with the head during better times. </p> <p>The proportion of 16-year-olds at Fir Vale gaining five or more exams at grade C or above rose from 11 to 17 per cent, but even a recognised superhead like Howe realises he is not out of the woods yet: the national target is 50 per cent. This weekend Howe, a straight-talking pragmatist, told The Observer that his targets had to be modest because he knew he was working with children who had become almost completely alienated from the education system. Next year, he will aim for 20 per cent. </p> <p>Research by the Roehampton Institute has identified a contradiction at the centre of New Labour's education policy. 'On the one hand, New Labour has decided to continue the Conservatives' policies of choice and competition; on the other hand, it has put in place a package of policies to reduce social exclusion,' says Jim Docking, senior researcher. These policies, which include privatisation of failing schools, the Fresh Start scheme, Education Action Zones, and the new Excellence in Cities programme to persuade middle-class parents back into the state system by introducing increased selection, have yet to be genuinely tested and this summer's exam results demonstrate that the gap between the educational haves and have-nots is as great as ever. </p> <p> <strong>Blunkett's timetable</strong><br></p> <p> <strong> May 1997 <br></strong></p> <p><strong>Numeracy and literacy targets </strong><br></p> <p> For 11-year-olds. </p> <p><strong> July 1997 <br></strong></p> <p><strong>Fresh Start</strong> <br> </p> <p>Blakelaw in Newcastle reopened under the name Firfield Community College. </p> <p><strong> September 1997 <br></strong></p> <p><strong>New Start</strong> <br></p> <p>\u00a310m over three years to help remotivate 14- to 17-year-olds who have dropped out. </p> <p><strong> January 1998 <br></strong></p> <p><strong>Headteachers honoured</strong> <br> </p> <p>To improve image of teaching. </p> <p><strong> May 1998 <br></strong></p> <p><strong>Social Exclusion Unit</strong> <br></p> <p>Truancy and social exclusion: calls for levels to be reduced by one-third by 2002. </p> <p><strong> July 1998 <br></strong></p> <p><strong>Sure Start Pre-School programme</strong> <br> </p> <p>Focus on 125,000 pre-school children and their families. </p> <p><strong> September 1998 <br></strong></p> <p><strong>New Deal for Communities</strong> <br> </p> <p>Deals with run-down estates and failure in schools. </p> <p><strong> February 1999 <br></strong></p> <p><strong>Booster classes</strong> <br> </p> <p>First 'crammer' lessons for Year 6 children with literacy and numeracy problems. </p> <p><strong> March 1999 <br></strong></p> <p><strong>Excellence in Cities</strong> <br></p> <p>Launched to revitalise urban schools. </p> <p><strong> July 1999</strong> <br> </p> <p>Teaching and Higher Education Act &amp; School Standards and Framework Act passed.

This weekend Howe, a straight-talking pragmatist, told The Observer that his targets had to be modest because he knew he was working with children who had become almost completely alienated from the education system. Next year, he will aim for 20 per cent. Research by the Roehampton Institute has identified a contradiction at the centre of New Labour's education policy. 'On the one hand, New Labour has decided to continue the Conservatives' policies of choice and competition; on the other hand, it has put in place a package of policies to reduce social exclusion,' says Jim Docking, senior researcher. These policies, which include privatisation of failing schools, the Fresh Start scheme, Education Action Zones, and the new Excellence in Cities programme to persuade middle-class parents back into the state system by introducing increased selection, have yet to be genuinely tested and this summer's exam results demonstrate that the gap between the educational haves and have-nots is as great as ever. Blunkett's timetable May 1997 Numeracy and literacy targets For 11-year-olds. July 1997 Fresh Start Blakelaw in Newcastle reopened under the name Firfield Community College. September 1997 New Start \u00a310m over three years to help remotivate 14- to 17-year-olds who have dropped out. January 1998 Headteachers honoured To improve image of teaching.

I've been a new girl at an American school where I refused to pledge allegiance to the flag. I've worn the wrong uniform, turned up at wrong times and thrown up in school toilets. However, each time I was merely an amateur new girl.

But as it happened my first day went disarmingly well. </p> <p>I still had hair when I woke up in the morning. I didn't trip over while walking into school. I was wearing similar clothes to everybody else. I had the same accent. I turned up at the right time, on the right day. I didn't get hiccups, I didn't sneeze at any awkward times all day. I had even remembered to clear out my schoolbag for the first time in four years so that when I took out a pen I didn't also spill hundreds of old tissues, Tampax, lottery tickets, socks, leaflets, holiday photos and pieces of homework still due at my old school. The only problem was that I was the wrong sex. </p> <p>This new school is a boys' school, which now takes girls in the sixth form. Scary. The boys wear proper suits and eat at proper tables. There is a whole vocabulary I've never heard of, like 'gating' and 'houses' and 'stations' and 'water'. They are actually going to make us play sport as opposed to allowing us to spend time in the multi-gym, sitting next to the rowing machine painting our nails and stretching. </p> <p>Throughout my prime teenage years I was denied the company of boys to carry my school bag and steal my protractor. After three years at an all-girl school, only seeing boys at the weekend, I was beginning to find myself wondering what a boy looked like when he wasn't holding a cigarette and a beer and trying to sleep with you. Therefore, seeing boys in a normal environment is a healthy change. </p> <p>The last time I was at school with boys was when kiss chase and sticker swapping were the most popular activities. It does not seem natural to be in an all-girl school when you're 16. You have boyfriends out of school but you are forced to see them as a different species. You only learn to interact with boys on one level, and it is unlike the outside world. </p> <p>Single-sex schools claim that they are protecting you but really it's just putting you in Bubble Wrap during the week and ripping it straight off at the weekend. It makes more sense just to let everyone get on as they were meant to, I suppose. </p> <p>What worries me is whether the classroom will end up mirroring society? Will the girls have to flutter their eyelashes when Disraeli is mentioned while the boys stirringly recount their views, opinions and impressive collection of facts? Will we have to stare into their eyes as they offer their theses on various wars? Will we have to giggle appreciatively when they define suffragettes as lesbians? </p> <p>Or will it teach us to stick up for ourselves.

      "body": "<p>A goal from substitute Michael Owen five minutes from the end earned England a highly creditable draw in a fiercely contested friendly against the best team around in world football at the moment. </p> <p>Anxious afterwards to stress that neither team had taken this fixture lightly, Kevin Keegan was already pleased with the performance of his reshaped post-Shearer side before Owen put a broad smile on his manager's face. This was a vastly different, more effervescent England than anything seen since the first 20 minutes of Euro 2000, and would have been even in defeat. The Stade de France was stunned by the cheekiest of equalisers, but long before that England had established they could live with the most illustrious of opponents. </p> <p>France are in the unique position of holding both World Cup and the European Championship, and certainly know how to make the most of it. After children in replica kits had paraded both trophies around the pitch, the start was delayed five minutes by presentations to the retiring Laurent Blanc, Didier Deschamps and Bernard Lama, then Zinedine Zidane was permitted to bring his child to the centre circle to perform a mock kick-off. </p> <p>England had little choice but to stand around whistling during this period of indulgence, and in the circumstances one could almost forgive Dennis Wise for fouling Zidane in the opening minute. </p> <p>England had promised to improve their passing and ball retention and were as good as their word from the outset. Both sets of supporters were rubbing their eyes in disbelief as Keegan's players tore into their opponents in the early stages, creating a couple of presentable scoring opportunities in the first 15 minutes. </p> <p>David Beckham found Darren Anderton easily on the right, but with Nick Barmby in particular showing mobility and awareness, England attacked through the middle and on the floor as if the last couple of years of ploughing predictable furrows down the flanks had just been a bad dream. </p> <p>Gareth Barry, coming forward confidently, swapped passes with Barmby and fired a warning shot at Lama's goal after six minutes, but the French goalkeeper was much more seriously tested five minutes later when Andy Cole got a header on target from Paul Scholes' ball into the box. Lama then nervously swatted an Anderton cross over his bar, and had to make the most agile of reaction saves when Beckham's corner bounced through to leave Barmby what looked like a simple header at the far post. </p> <p>If this makes it sound like it was all England, it was never quite that. Zidane escaped his midfield minders in the 10th minute to carry the ball past Barmby's flailing challenge to leave Nicolas Anelka a shot from the edge of the area, and Deschamps also went close before the interval.

      "bodyText": "A goal from substitute Michael Owen five minutes from the end earned England a highly creditable draw in a fiercely contested friendly against the best team around in world football at the moment. Anxious afterwards to stress that neither team had taken this fixture lightly, Kevin Keegan was already pleased with the performance of his reshaped post-Shearer side before Owen put a broad smile on his manager's face. This was a vastly different, more effervescent England than anything seen since the first 20 minutes of Euro 2000, and would have been even in defeat. The Stade de France was stunned by the cheekiest of equalisers, but long before that England had established they could live with the most illustrious of opponents. France are in the unique position of holding both World Cup and the European Championship, and certainly know how to make the most of it. After children in replica kits had paraded both trophies around the pitch, the start was delayed five minutes by presentations to the retiring Laurent Blanc, Didier Deschamps and Bernard Lama, then Zinedine Zidane was permitted to bring his child to the centre circle to perform a mock kick-off. England had little choice but to stand around whistling during this period of indulgence, and in the circumstances one could almost forgive Dennis Wise for fouling Zidane in the opening minute. England had promised to improve their passing and ball retention and were as good as their word from the outset. Both sets of supporters were rubbing their eyes in disbelief as Keegan's players tore into their opponents in the early stages, creating a couple of presentable scoring opportunities in the first 15 minutes. David Beckham found Darren Anderton easily on the right, but with Nick Barmby in particular showing mobility and awareness, England attacked through the middle and on the floor as if the last couple of years of ploughing predictable furrows down the flanks had just been a bad dream. Gareth Barry, coming forward confidently, swapped passes with Barmby and fired a warning shot at Lama's goal after six minutes, but the French goalkeeper was much more seriously tested five minutes later when Andy Cole got a header on target from Paul Scholes' ball into the box. Lama then nervously swatted an Anderton cross over his bar, and had to make the most agile of reaction saves when Beckham's corner bounced through to leave Barmby what looked like a simple header at the far post. If this makes it sound like it was all England, it was never quite that. Zidane escaped his midfield minders in the 10th minute to carry the ball past Barmby's flailing challenge to leave Nicolas Anelka a shot from the edge of the area, and Deschamps also went close before the interval. France came into the game more as Zidane began to make his presence felt towards the end of the first half, but England made encouraging progress practically every time they went forward. Beckham distributed with precision and economy from midfield, but more often than not it was Scholes' final ball which found an opening. England replaced Tony Adams, victim of a double tackle by Marcel Desailly and Deschamps, with Gareth Southgate for the second half, the captain's armband passing to Sol Campbell at right-back. France brought on Sylvain Wiltord, who immediately looked busier than Anelka, feeding Zidane for another defence-splitting pass in the 49th minute.

Two of Britain's Olympic contenders told The Observer they were seeing rises in respiratory problems among colleagues, and both put the problem down to UK athletes training in polluted air. Up to 50 per cent of athletes competing in long-distance running, cycling, swimming and cross-country skiing events are developing the problem. The reasons are unclear since the causes of asthma are not known, although pollution, smoking and diet are known to be contributory fac tors. However, scientists claim cold air is a factor for skiers, and chlorine in pools a factor for swimmers. Paula Radcliffe is one of the UK's brightest hopes for a gold medal in Sydney. The 10,000 metre runner has been suffering from asthma since she began seriously training as an athlete at the age of 14. The pollen and pollution in Sydney may hinder her performance. Although she refuses to see asthma as a handicap, she believes her condition is exercise-induced. 'I find the number of ath letes suffering from asthma quite shocking,' she said. 'I put it down to an increase in pollution, especially as it is mostly among those who trainin the open air.' The World Congress on Lung Diseases in Florence yesterday heard that half of the Olympic cyclists who had competed in the 1996 Atlanta games had asthma. British cyclist Chris Boardman said: 'I would blame it on pollution. I spend most of my life gasping for breath.'",

Scores of army and RUC vehicles were deployed in the feud-torn loyalist stronghold during an Ulster Volunteer Force commemoration rally yesterday. Members of the rival Ulster Defence Association were held back from thousands of UVF members and their supporters as they gathered for the annual Brian Robinson memorial march. Robinson was shot dead by an undercover army unit after carrying out a sectarian murder in nearby Ardoyne. A line of police officers and soldiers stretched across Agnes Street, the de facto boundary between the UDA-dominated Lower Shankill and the UVF strongholds on the middle and upper part of the road. Army vehicles were also in position across Heather Street in the Middle Shankill, in a protective cordon around a social club frequented by the UDA. A dozen or so UDA members watched UVF members gather from comparative safety behind army lines. The bitter loyalist in-fighting which flared at a UDA-organised band parade along the Shankill road two weeks ago has seen three people killed and several wounded including an 11-year-old girl. Seventy families have been forced from their homes. Marshals at yesterday's parade, some wearing white shirts and black UVF ties with UVF emblazoned on the front, ensured there was no trouble at the march, but there was no let up in the war of words with the UDA.

One slogan said: 'Johnny Adair - simply the pest' (Adair's notorious 'C' company claim it is 'simply the best'). Another slogan called for the disbandment of 'C' company, urging other UDA units to disown Adair's outfit. In the Lower Shankill a small group of UDA supporters held a protest against the UVF. They accused the UVF's political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, of being in league with Sinn Fein. A UVF commander at the march said that he could no see no immediate end to the feuding. His pessimism was underlined by a further attack early yesterday on the home of a PUP member in the Silverstream area of North Belfast. Although no one was hurt in the pipe bomb blast it was the first time the internecine fighting had spread to northern Belfast, marking another escalation in the feud.",

The controversial calming drug treatment for disturbed and aggressive children has been regarded by many parents as a lifeline since it was first prescribed in Britain. Its use has grown rapidly, with the number of prescriptions tripling in the 1990s. Now the National Health Service's 'best practice' watchdog is to issue guidelines advising caution on its use for very young children. There are concerns that the use of the medication can mask emotional or other causes of troubled behaviour. Psychiatrists have warned that toddler tantrums, for example, may be confused with more serious disorders. Ritalin, methylphenidate, was referred by Health Secretary Alan Milburn to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, the independent watchdog which rules on the appropriate use of drugs. It recommends that Ritalin should not be given to under-fives. Although older children may continue to receive it, there will be clearer definitions of the conditions for which it can be beneficial as part of a specialist treatment programme. A recent study found prescription of stimulants to American children under four, suffering from conditions including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), increased threefold between 1991 and 1995, with the trend still rising.

      "body": "<p>Girls as young as five are being driven towards obesity and eating disorders by unwitting parents desperate to prevent them becoming overweight, according to new research.</p> <p>The work, to be outlined in Glasgow this week, reveals that some middle-class parents are putting pressure on their daughters to stay thin from such an early age that they develop unhealthy preoccupations with their weight by the time they start school.</p> <p>With childhood obesity rising at an epidemic pace globally, the American study of five-to-nine-year-olds found that girls whose parents stopped them from eating foods they condemned as fattening were at much greater risk of suffering weight and eating problems.</p> <p>They lost the ability to regulate their own food intake and, unable to understand cues from their bodies telling them whether they were hungry or not, binged on the restricted food whenever their parents were not around to stop them.</p> <p>According to the researchers, it was the mothers who were most concerned about their own weight and who dieted most often who were most likely to risk their daughters' health and self-image by attempting to restrict their diet.</p> <p>The studies have so far focused on affluent, white American families. Scottish doctors are now carrying out research on three to five-year-olds in Glasgow amid concerns that youngsters are developing similar problems in Britain, where obesity is about to overtake asthma as the biggest threat to child health.</p> <p>Leann Birch, professor of child nutrition at Pennsylvania State University, who will outline her findings to a child nutrition conference at Glasgow University on Wednesday, told The Observer: 'Essentially, mothers who used more restriction had daughters who, in the absence of hunger, ate more snack foods when they were available. This indicated a heightened response to the presence of palatable food and a consequent reduction in the ability to regulate energy intake in response to hunger and satiety cues.' Revealingly, girls were far more likely to demonstrate this effect than boys.</p> <p>The phenomenon, according to the study, appears to be connected to affluence.</p> <p>While many middle-class mothers were obsessed with keeping themselves and their daughters thin, low-income parents were more concerned with feeding their children enough and so were far less likely to restrict their diet.</p> <p>John Reilly, a senior lecturer in child nutrition at Glasgow University who is leading the Scottish research project, said: 'Obesity is fast becoming the single biggest child health problem in this country Clearly, it is not a good thing for five-year-olds to be preoccupied with their weight and shape.'</p> <p>The research also provides startling new evidence of the extent to which young children are susceptible to notions of the ideal body shape.</p> <p>The latest research shows that even the youngest girls, picking up cues from their mothers, feel under pressure to lose weight. Half of the 200 five-year-olds interviewed gave worryingly informed responses to questions about dieting and weight loss. Asked why people dieted, some responded that it was to get thin so they could 'get more dates'.</p> <p>Birch said: 'We have found that these kids are are already concerned about their weight and shape and are talking about being too fat. This is behaviour you wouldn't normally expect before they reached puberty. It is horrifying.'</p> <p>Sara McCluskey, a doctor at the Chrysalis Centre, a juvenile eating disorder unit in Kent, said: 'The findings are very depressing. Our society puts so much emphasis on what people look like, and children are picking that up from a younger and younger age.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Girls as young as five are being driven towards obesity and eating disorders by unwitting parents desperate to prevent them becoming overweight, according to new research. The work, to be outlined in Glasgow this week, reveals that some middle-class parents are putting pressure on their daughters to stay thin from such an early age that they develop unhealthy preoccupations with their weight by the time they start school. With childhood obesity rising at an epidemic pace globally, the American study of five-to-nine-year-olds found that girls whose parents stopped them from eating foods they condemned as fattening were at much greater risk of suffering weight and eating problems. They lost the ability to regulate their own food intake and, unable to understand cues from their bodies telling them whether they were hungry or not, binged on the restricted food whenever their parents were not around to stop them. According to the researchers, it was the mothers who were most concerned about their own weight and who dieted most often who were most likely to risk their daughters' health and self-image by attempting to restrict their diet. The studies have so far focused on affluent, white American families. Scottish doctors are now carrying out research on three to five-year-olds in Glasgow amid concerns that youngsters are developing similar problems in Britain, where obesity is about to overtake asthma as the biggest threat to child health. Leann Birch, professor of child nutrition at Pennsylvania State University, who will outline her findings to a child nutrition conference at Glasgow University on Wednesday, told The Observer: 'Essentially, mothers who used more restriction had daughters who, in the absence of hunger, ate more snack foods when they were available. This indicated a heightened response to the presence of palatable food and a consequent reduction in the ability to regulate energy intake in response to hunger and satiety cues.' Revealingly, girls were far more likely to demonstrate this effect than boys. The phenomenon, according to the study, appears to be connected to affluence. While many middle-class mothers were obsessed with keeping themselves and their daughters thin, low-income parents were more concerned with feeding their children enough and so were far less likely to restrict their diet. John Reilly, a senior lecturer in child nutrition at Glasgow University who is leading the Scottish research project, said: 'Obesity is fast becoming the single biggest child health problem in this country Clearly, it is not a good thing for five-year-olds to be preoccupied with their weight and shape.' The research also provides startling new evidence of the extent to which young children are susceptible to notions of the ideal body shape. The latest research shows that even the youngest girls, picking up cues from their mothers, feel under pressure to lose weight. Half of the 200 five-year-olds interviewed gave worryingly informed responses to questions about dieting and weight loss. Asked why people dieted, some responded that it was to get thin so they could 'get more dates'. Birch said: 'We have found that these kids are are already concerned about their weight and shape and are talking about being too fat. This is behaviour you wouldn't normally expect before they reached puberty. It is horrifying.' Sara McCluskey, a doctor at the Chrysalis Centre, a juvenile eating disorder unit in Kent, said: 'The findings are very depressing. Our society puts so much emphasis on what people look like, and children are picking that up from a younger and younger age.'",

The Prime Minister announced earlier this week that three million samples have now been collected from arrested suspects, to be matched against evidence gathered from unsolved crimes in order to unmask offenders. But the scheme is in danger of being undermined by troubles facing its 'brother' database, which stores samples voluntarily given by police and civilian staff so that traces of their DNA unwittingly left by them at the scene of a crime can be ruled out from investigations. Fewer than half the officers targeted by a \u00a333 million Home Office campaign have so far come forward to give samples, although the deadline is for the end of this month. 'If we don't get the takeup, the database will be no good and we will never secure a conviction because the elimination process won't be secure,' said Dave Rodgers, vice-chair of the Metropolitan Police Federation.

The inquest into the massacre will begin in Omagh on Wednesday. Bruton also ruled out any possibility of Fine Gael entering a coalition with Sinn Fein following the next general election. 'They would have to end their links with paramilitarism before we would even consider it,' he said. The former Taoiseach rejected unionist claims that there was no difference between Sinn Fein being in government in Northern Ireland and entering a possible coalition in the Republic. 'It is different because the Executive in Northern Ireland does not have the power over the military and police. Power is exercised in London on those matters but in the Dail the government controls policing and the military powers. Therefore no party with paramilitary links can be in that government.'",

The GMB is resurrecting its 'snouts in the trough' campaign - which made a villain of British Gas chairman Cedric Brown, and was used by the Opposition to embarrass a Tory government. This time it is Labour Ministers on the line. Trade Secretary Stephen Byers has been promising since early 1999 to strengthen shareholders' powers to intervene in boardroom pay packets, but unions are impatient for legislation. Cedric the pig, which the GMB once paraded at a British Gas annual meeting, will make a return appearance at next week's TUC conference in Glasgow - renamed after Luc Vandevelde, the new Marks &amp; Spencer chairman. His \u00a3650,000 salary plus \u00a3650,000 bonus infuriated the GMB, since his firm cancelled contracts with British clothing suppliers, leading to thousands of job losses. A meeting of shareholders in July also questioned whether directors' pay, particularly that of former chairman Peter Salisbury, should have risen given M&amp;S's problems. John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB, said: 'We had hoped that with the change of government Cedric would have been able to enjoy a long and happy retirement, but it's clear that boardroom greed is as rampant today as it ever was. 'When thousands of loyal workers are sacked in a drive to cut costs and at the same time the man who wields the axe is burying his nose in the trough to the tune of two million pounds, then the time has clearly come for Ministers to act.' The original Cedric - who despite the name was a sow - was installed on a city farm in the Isle of Dogs after her part in the campaign and gave birth to seven piglets just before the election. Ironically, her former GMB minder, Phil Woolas, is now a Labour MP. While she has been tracked down by the union for one last curtain call, he is not likely to be joining her. As for Brown, he retired in 1996 admitting he was 'hurt' but still defending his salary of \u00a3471,000 - which by today's standards looks positively restrained. Behind the lighthearted stunt is a serious point. The unions fear there will be no legislation to strengthen shareholders' powers before the next election. In an interview earlier this month, Byers praised the shareholders of Vodafone for holding down directors' remuneration, pointing out that they had done so under existing powers, in comments that brought speculation he was retreating from legislating to provide new powers. A spokesman for Byers insisted he would be unveiling proposals soon but that executive pay was a matter for companies to resolve. The issue has proved politically difficult because of sustained pressure from the City arguing that top level pay in the private sector is not a matter for government. A recent survey of directors' pay carried out by the Guardian found rises running at 16.4 per cent, four times higher than for ordinary workers, despite Treasury calls for restraint in wage rises.",

      "body": "<p>Among the tributes and messages of condolences that poured in to the friends and family of the artist Euan Uglow, who died last week of cancer at the age of 68, one has gone unreported in the obituaries and news stories. It was a call to Prowse and Darby, Uglow's dealer in London's Cork Street, from Downing Street asking to be informed of the arrangements for the funeral of the man who was Britain's greatest living figurative artist.</p> <p>Behind that telephone call is the hidden story of one of Uglow's most remarkable friendships - which he cherished and revealed only to his closest friends - but which the famously discreet artist protected fiercely from the scrutiny of the media and the outside world. It was his friendship with Cherie Blair, her husband the Prime Minister, and their common friend, Derry Irvine, the Lord Chancellor.</p> <p>And behind that friendship with the Blairs and Irvine lies an even more extraordinary story, of a sitting for a life study made by a young law student in the Seventies for an artist notoriously demanding of the forbearance of his models. Uglow's models would sometimes be required to sit for many sessions over several years in geometrically pleasing, if contorted and painful, positions while he worked on a single painting. That life sitting - for an uncompleted canvass - was with Cherie Booth, later to be Cherie Blair.</p> <p>It is a sitting that has become the source of controversy over repeated denials to the media by Cherie Blair's office that she had ever modelled for an Uglow life study. Yesterday her office conceded for the first time that as a student she had posed as an artist's model for Uglow.</p> <p>He produced only a small body of work, the best known of which were his female nudes. His famous perfectionism was responsible for a work rate which at his busiest saw him complete only two canvasses a year.</p> <p>Small, wiry, bearded, bespectacled - and inevitably in sandals - Uglow was the antithesis of the showy Saatchi generation of young artists, rarely giving interviews to the media and living a garret-like lifestyle in the studio-home he had occupied for almost four decades in south London. It was a fiercely regimented life that harked back to a previous age.</p> <p>Despite the high profile accorded to the Young British Artists invited to Downing Street for cocktails to meet the luminaries of the Blair project early in the New Labour administration, the truth is that if anyone could claim the soubriquet of 'New Labour's favourite artist' it was not the brash headline grabbers such as Damien Hirst or Tracey Emin, but Uglow, a man largely unknown to a wider public.</p> <p>Uglow met the young couple who would one day occupy Downing Street through Irvine, one of his oldest friends. Both served as pupils in Irvine's chambers and it was, perhaps, inevitable that the future Lord Chancellor should introduce two of his brightest prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to his artist friend. And given how attractive the young Cherie Booth was, it was also, perhaps, inevitable that Uglow should ask her to model for him - for a man then recognised as one of the most significant figures in contemporary British art.</p> <p>Uglow, however, was a famously difficult painter to sit for. Having decided what he wanted to paint, he would pose his life models in difficult positions, using plumblines and chalk markers to maintain them in position, insisting on absolute stillness while he painted. Sometimes he would work on the same subject for up to seven years.</p> <p>Indeed, Uglow admitted once that sitting for him could be a gruelling experience. 'The positions I ask my models to sustain,' he once said, 'are difficult, emotionally and physically.'</p> <p>And even if Uglow asked his models to sit only once a week, the commitment was long term, often lasting years as he worked on a single painting. In the case of the painting for which Cherie sat that was to be a problem.</p> <p>'While I am painting,' Uglow once said, '[my models] often go through a cycle of personal events. When one model first arrived, she had a boyfriend. Later she married, and by the time I was done, she was divorced.' In Cherie Booth's case she found the commitment as Uglow's muse to be too consuming.</p> <p>'The picture he worked on with Cherie has never been in the public domain. It was never completed,' said Uglow's friend and dealer William Darby last week. 'Euan was always quite adamant about it not being seen. He was always very protective of her.</p> <p>'She sat for him for a couple years when she was a law student in the Seventies. But she moved on and the painting was never finished. Euan began again, working on the same idea with a different model.'</p> <p>Indeed, since the Blairs have been in Downing Street the unfinished Uglow has become something of the stuff of journalistic legend - often assumed until last week to be the stuff of urban myth, its existence only hinted at in the diary columns.</p> <p>And until yesterday Cherie Blair's office has carefully denied the fact that any of Uglow's famous nudes included her. For his part, Uglow had been equally defensive - his silence, said a spokesman for Cherie Blair last night, was the 'mark of a true friend'.</p> <p>Indeed, when a tabloid journalist turned up on the doorstep of Uglow's mewshouse clutching a reproduction taken from a catalogue - demanding to know whether the model was Cherie Blair - he was turned away with a flea in his ear.</p> <p>Yesterday, however, Cherie Blair broke her silence over the sitting, her office conceding that she had sat for an unfinished painting. 'Both of the Blairs knew Euan Uglow through Derry Irvine when they were pupils in his chambers although they had not seen him for several years.'</p> <p>The sitting, say Uglow's friends, was the beginning of a long-term affection that continued on both sides although they saw less of each other in recent years. Indeed Uglow is credited with interesting Tony Blair in the work of one of his favourite artists - Pierro della Francesca - a major influence on Uglow's art.</p> <p>But Uglow's closest and most enduring friendship in New Labour has been with the bon vivant Lord Chancellor, with whom Uglow shared a passion for fine art, good food and even finer claret.</p> <p>Friends say that faced with the diagnosis of the cancer that would kill Uglow, Irvine accompanied the artist to Italy to see his favourite paintings for one last time.</p> <p>\u0095 Euan Uglow's last completed work, Nuria, is presently on show at the National Gallery in the exhibition Encounters</p>",

      "bodyText": "Among the tributes and messages of condolences that poured in to the friends and family of the artist Euan Uglow, who died last week of cancer at the age of 68, one has gone unreported in the obituaries and news stories. It was a call to Prowse and Darby, Uglow's dealer in London's Cork Street, from Downing Street asking to be informed of the arrangements for the funeral of the man who was Britain's greatest living figurative artist. Behind that telephone call is the hidden story of one of Uglow's most remarkable friendships - which he cherished and revealed only to his closest friends - but which the famously discreet artist protected fiercely from the scrutiny of the media and the outside world. It was his friendship with Cherie Blair, her husband the Prime Minister, and their common friend, Derry Irvine, the Lord Chancellor. And behind that friendship with the Blairs and Irvine lies an even more extraordinary story, of a sitting for a life study made by a young law student in the Seventies for an artist notoriously demanding of the forbearance of his models. Uglow's models would sometimes be required to sit for many sessions over several years in geometrically pleasing, if contorted and painful, positions while he worked on a single painting. That life sitting - for an uncompleted canvass - was with Cherie Booth, later to be Cherie Blair. It is a sitting that has become the source of controversy over repeated denials to the media by Cherie Blair's office that she had ever modelled for an Uglow life study. Yesterday her office conceded for the first time that as a student she had posed as an artist's model for Uglow. He produced only a small body of work, the best known of which were his female nudes. His famous perfectionism was responsible for a work rate which at his busiest saw him complete only two canvasses a year. Small, wiry, bearded, bespectacled - and inevitably in sandals - Uglow was the antithesis of the showy Saatchi generation of young artists, rarely giving interviews to the media and living a garret-like lifestyle in the studio-home he had occupied for almost four decades in south London. It was a fiercely regimented life that harked back to a previous age. Despite the high profile accorded to the Young British Artists invited to Downing Street for cocktails to meet the luminaries of the Blair project early in the New Labour administration, the truth is that if anyone could claim the soubriquet of 'New Labour's favourite artist' it was not the brash headline grabbers such as Damien Hirst or Tracey Emin, but Uglow, a man largely unknown to a wider public. Uglow met the young couple who would one day occupy Downing Street through Irvine, one of his oldest friends. Both served as pupils in Irvine's chambers and it was, perhaps, inevitable that the future Lord Chancellor should introduce two of his brightest prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to his artist friend. And given how attractive the young Cherie Booth was, it was also, perhaps, inevitable that Uglow should ask her to model for him - for a man then recognised as one of the most significant figures in contemporary British art. Uglow, however, was a famously difficult painter to sit for. Having decided what he wanted to paint, he would pose his life models in difficult positions, using plumblines and chalk markers to maintain them in position, insisting on absolute stillness while he painted. Sometimes he would work on the same subject for up to seven years. Indeed, Uglow admitted once that sitting for him could be a gruelling experience. 'The positions I ask my models to sustain,' he once said, 'are difficult, emotionally and physically.' And even if Uglow asked his models to sit only once a week, the commitment was long term, often lasting years as he worked on a single painting. In the case of the painting for which Cherie sat that was to be a problem. 'While I am painting,' Uglow once said, '[my models] often go through a cycle of personal events. When one model first arrived, she had a boyfriend. Later she married, and by the time I was done, she was divorced.' In Cherie Booth's case she found the commitment as Uglow's muse to be too consuming. 'The picture he worked on with Cherie has never been in the public domain. It was never completed,' said Uglow's friend and dealer William Darby last week. 'Euan was always quite adamant about it not being seen. He was always very protective of her. 'She sat for him for a couple years when she was a law student in the Seventies. But she moved on and the painting was never finished. Euan began again, working on the same idea with a different model.' Indeed, since the Blairs have been in Downing Street the unfinished Uglow has become something of the stuff of journalistic legend - often assumed until last week to be the stuff of urban myth, its existence only hinted at in the diary columns. And until yesterday Cherie Blair's office has carefully denied the fact that any of Uglow's famous nudes included her. For his part, Uglow had been equally defensive - his silence, said a spokesman for Cherie Blair last night, was the 'mark of a true friend'. Indeed, when a tabloid journalist turned up on the doorstep of Uglow's mewshouse clutching a reproduction taken from a catalogue - demanding to know whether the model was Cherie Blair - he was turned away with a flea in his ear. Yesterday, however, Cherie Blair broke her silence over the sitting, her office conceding that she had sat for an unfinished painting. 'Both of the Blairs knew Euan Uglow through Derry Irvine when they were pupils in his chambers although they had not seen him for several years.' The sitting, say Uglow's friends, was the beginning of a long-term affection that continued on both sides although they saw less of each other in recent years. Indeed Uglow is credited with interesting Tony Blair in the work of one of his favourite artists - Pierro della Francesca - a major influence on Uglow's art. But Uglow's closest and most enduring friendship in New Labour has been with the bon vivant Lord Chancellor, with whom Uglow shared a passion for fine art, good food and even finer claret. Friends say that faced with the diagnosis of the cancer that would kill Uglow, Irvine accompanied the artist to Italy to see his favourite paintings for one last time. \u0095 Euan Uglow's last completed work, Nuria, is presently on show at the National Gallery in the exhibition Encounters",

A continuing parliamentary inquiry into the growing number of black market weapons has concluded that there are more than three million illegally held firearms in circulation - double the number believed to have been held 10 years ago - and that criminals are more willing than ever to use them. The events of the past week have provided sobering evidence of how deeply ingrained Britain's new gun culture has become. Officers patrolling the Notting Hill carnival last month said they had been prevented from searching a suspect, later found to be carrying a loaded 9mm pistol, for fear of inciting violence. Last Monday, doormen trying to break up a fight at the Epping Forest Country Club in Essex watched in horror as several revellers produced guns and began shooting at them. Two doormen were hit and seriously injured. A few hours later, a man was shot in the head during a 'road rage' row in south London. Last Tuesday, three people were left fighting for their lives after a group of young Rolex robbers ambushed them in the driveway of their luxury home in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire. Millionaire Joe Martorana had just stepped out of his BMW when two men snatched the Rolex from his wrist. When his wife, Josephine, tried to raise the alarm, she was shot once in the back by a handgun. As she lay bleeding, the gunmen snatched her Rolex. The couple's son, 18-year-old Steven, and his girlfriend, Isabella, had heard the shot from inside the house. They rushed through the front door to confront the robbers who gunned them down. Steven was hit by a bullet in his chest, and Isabella was shot in the stomach. A few hours later, a 28-year-old man was seriously injured after being shot at a London nightclub. Last Wednesday, Essex builder Ronald Fuller was shot dead by a moped-riding gunman who waited near his home. Fuller, who has a child, was shot twice in the head and twice in the body at point-blank range. Fuller had been acquitted of stabbing a man to death at the Epping Forest Country Club.

      "body": "<p>Four of the medical experts advising the Government on whether the new meningitis C vaccine is safe have links to one or more of the drug companies that produce it, The Observer has discovered. The revelations, following last week's report of a cover-up of suspected adverse reactions to the drug, has prompted concern among parents and MPs about conflicts of interest in the medical profession.</p> <p>The Department of Health last night confirmed that Professor Janet Darbyshire, a member of the Government's Committee on Safety of Medicines, had received support for academic research from US firms Wyeth and Chiron, who produce the two main meningitis products being used on children in Britain: Meningitec and Meninjugate. Darbyshire is professor of epidemiology at London University and director of the Medical Research Council.</p> <p>DoH officials also confirmed that three members of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had declared interests in vaccine manufacturers.</p> <p>One of them, Dr David Goldblatt of the Institute of Child Health, has served on an expert advisory panel for Wyeth and received research grants from Wyeth and North American Vaccines, which produces a third meningitis C drug to be introduced this year. Another, Professor Keith Cartwright of the University of Bristol, received funding from the drug industry to 'evaluate candidate meningicoccal vaccines'.</p> <p>Exposure of the links between the advisers and drugs firms came as the Government's Chief Medical Officer reacted strongly to last week's Observer story of how information on possible adverse reactions to the vaccine was kept from parents. In a letter to The Observer, published today, Professor Liam Donaldson insists information on reactions to vaccinations is sent, on request, to members of the public, health professionals or MPs by the Medicines Con trol Agency. 'There is not, and never has been, a \"cover-up\" over releasing information about reported deaths or suspected adverse reactions following meningitis C vaccine,' he said.</p> <p>This week every GP in the country will receive a statement from the chairs of the two committees, assuring them of the safety of the meningitis C vaccine. The statement, from Professor Alasdair Breckenridge of the Committee on Safety of Medi cines, and Professor Michael Langman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, updates information made public by The Observer last weekend about bad reactions to the new vaccine reported by GPs and nurses. It says there have been 16,527 reported adverse reactions from 7,742 patients, and 12 deaths.

      "bodyText": "Four of the medical experts advising the Government on whether the new meningitis C vaccine is safe have links to one or more of the drug companies that produce it, The Observer has discovered. The revelations, following last week's report of a cover-up of suspected adverse reactions to the drug, has prompted concern among parents and MPs about conflicts of interest in the medical profession. The Department of Health last night confirmed that Professor Janet Darbyshire, a member of the Government's Committee on Safety of Medicines, had received support for academic research from US firms Wyeth and Chiron, who produce the two main meningitis products being used on children in Britain: Meningitec and Meninjugate. Darbyshire is professor of epidemiology at London University and director of the Medical Research Council. DoH officials also confirmed that three members of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation had declared interests in vaccine manufacturers. One of them, Dr David Goldblatt of the Institute of Child Health, has served on an expert advisory panel for Wyeth and received research grants from Wyeth and North American Vaccines, which produces a third meningitis C drug to be introduced this year. Another, Professor Keith Cartwright of the University of Bristol, received funding from the drug industry to 'evaluate candidate meningicoccal vaccines'. Exposure of the links between the advisers and drugs firms came as the Government's Chief Medical Officer reacted strongly to last week's Observer story of how information on possible adverse reactions to the vaccine was kept from parents. In a letter to The Observer, published today, Professor Liam Donaldson insists information on reactions to vaccinations is sent, on request, to members of the public, health professionals or MPs by the Medicines Con trol Agency. 'There is not, and never has been, a \"cover-up\" over releasing information about reported deaths or suspected adverse reactions following meningitis C vaccine,' he said. This week every GP in the country will receive a statement from the chairs of the two committees, assuring them of the safety of the meningitis C vaccine. The statement, from Professor Alasdair Breckenridge of the Committee on Safety of Medi cines, and Professor Michael Langman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, updates information made public by The Observer last weekend about bad reactions to the new vaccine reported by GPs and nurses. It says there have been 16,527 reported adverse reactions from 7,742 patients, and 12 deaths. It reiterates that none of the deaths reported by GPs was found to be connected to the vaccine. The statement ends: 'The balance of risk and benefit is overwhelmingly favourable. There is no suggestion that this vaccine has led to any deaths. We strongly recommend that those due for vaccination should receive meningitis C vaccine.' Latest figures show that more than 15 million doses of the meningitis C vaccine have been give to children and teenagers in the past 10 months. Statistics from the Public Health Laboratory Service show that, in the 15-to-17-year-old group, in the last 12 weeks only six cases of meningitis were reported, compared with 26 in the same period last year. And in children under one year old, there was only one case reported in this period, compared with 19 in 1999. Incidences of meningitis continue to rise in those who have not been vaccinated. Despite assurances that information on possible adverse reactions to the vaccine is freely available, parents calling the Medicines Control Agency told The Observer they were still being refused the data. In north Somerset, one mother of a 13-year-old was told 'it wasn't necessary' for her to have that information. 'My son is about to have his vaccination and, after reading last week's Observer that figures on adverse reactions existed, I wanted to see them. I believe I have a right as a mother to have all the information to hand when I make a decision,' she said. She said the agency employee had told her: 'Stories like this should really be taken cum grano salis - that's a pinch of salt in English, madam.' Another caller was told that the MCA did not have the information and referred her to her doctor. A third caller eventually managed to get a copy of the letter sent to GPs. The figures collated by the agency are based on the 'yellow card reporting scheme'. This seeks reports of suspected adverse reactions to drugs from health professionals. They are requested to submit reports of reactions whether or not it is clear that a drug or vaccine caused it. The 12 deaths reported under this scheme may be an underestimation, since only around 15 per cent of GPs and healthcare professionals use the yellow card scheme. The Department of Health believes that the reporting rate is higher where a new drug is involved. The Liberal Democrat consumer affairs spokesman, Norman Baker, has tabled parliamentary questions about the financial interests of members of Department of Health advisory committees. He said last night: 'This is a question of propriety. There must be enough independent people around to give advice without turning to those who clearly have a conflict of interests. I am not questioning their academic credentials, but with the best will in the world their judgments must be looked at in that context.' Tory Health spokesman Liam Fox, a GP, said the Government must reassure the public. The Secretary of State authorised the licence for the Wyeth vaccine, Meningitec, when the mass immunisation programme began last November, on advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation also recommended the vaccine. Wyeth spokesman Don Barrett said the amount of money paid to the academic departments of government committee members was confidential. Chiron, whose vaccine was introduced in April, stands to make $200 million from the NHS deal. Last night the National Meningitis Trust, sponsored by Wyeth, was drawn into the controversy when it refused to disclose how much money it received from the giant drug company. In a statement, Chief Executive Philip Kirby said: 'We would refute in the strongest possible terms the suggestion that any information we provide is anything other than totally objective and the best available.'

      "body": "<p>Labour enters the party conference season with a clear 12 per cent lead over the Conservatives - up from 8 per cent last month.</p> <p>The gap is at its widest since April, suggesting that Labour has recovered strongly from its problems earlier in the summer. Taking main polls published in August, and adjusting raw data to take account of pro-Labour biases in most polls in recent years, Labour stands on 45 per cent (up two since July), with the Conservatives on 33 per cent (down two) and the Liberal Democrats on 16 (up one).</p> <p>The figures, part of a computer analysis commissioned by <a href=\"http://www.yougov.com\" target=\"_NEW\">YouGov</a>, the new e-democracy website, reflect increases in Labour's lead recorded by three polls in the past three weeks - by Gallup for the Daily Telegraph, ICM for the Guardian and Mori for the Times. With eight months until a possible general election next May, Labour remains on course for a three-figure majority. Even if the economy falters over the winter, the majority should still be at least 50 in a spring 2001 election - though it could evaporate if Tony Blair waits until next autumn.</p> <p>This analysis, which The Observer is publishing monthly up to the election, is the work of Professor David Sanders of Essex University and myself. Our 'Kellner-Sanders Index' builds on lessons learnt in the Nineties about polling biases, and the relationship between party support and such influences as consumer confidence.</p> <p>On our model, Labour's support is back to the level we would expect, given the current state of consumer confidence, having fallen below the predicted level in July, when the Government was battered by leaks and mishaps. It looks as if normal service has resumed, with each main party commanding much the same support as in the 1997 general election. Hence our projection that Labour's majority would slip by just eight, from 179 to 171, were an election held now.</p> <p>This is bad for William Hague.

      "bodyText": "Labour enters the party conference season with a clear 12 per cent lead over the Conservatives - up from 8 per cent last month. The gap is at its widest since April, suggesting that Labour has recovered strongly from its problems earlier in the summer. Taking main polls published in August, and adjusting raw data to take account of pro-Labour biases in most polls in recent years, Labour stands on 45 per cent (up two since July), with the Conservatives on 33 per cent (down two) and the Liberal Democrats on 16 (up one). The figures, part of a computer analysis commissioned by YouGov, the new e-democracy website, reflect increases in Labour's lead recorded by three polls in the past three weeks - by Gallup for the Daily Telegraph, ICM for the Guardian and Mori for the Times. With eight months until a possible general election next May, Labour remains on course for a three-figure majority. Even if the economy falters over the winter, the majority should still be at least 50 in a spring 2001 election - though it could evaporate if Tony Blair waits until next autumn. This analysis, which The Observer is publishing monthly up to the election, is the work of Professor David Sanders of Essex University and myself. Our 'Kellner-Sanders Index' builds on lessons learnt in the Nineties about polling biases, and the relationship between party support and such influences as consumer confidence. On our model, Labour's support is back to the level we would expect, given the current state of consumer confidence, having fallen below the predicted level in July, when the Government was battered by leaks and mishaps. It looks as if normal service has resumed, with each main party commanding much the same support as in the 1997 general election. Hence our projection that Labour's majority would slip by just eight, from 179 to 171, were an election held now. This is bad for William Hague. He had hoped to build on the momentum the Tories enjoyed between mid-May and mid-June, when they were gaining ground on Labour. Had the Tories entered this year's conference season just five or six points behind Labour, he would be able to project himself as a man to topple Blair from his Downing Street perch. As things stand, the pressure is back on the Tory leader. One prominent Conservative - David Davis, the chairman of the all-party Public Accounts Committee - has complained that the Shadow Cabinet has failed to do enough to sustain earlier momentum and allowed government support to recover during the summer.

In other words, the Tories are in an even worse plight than Davis says, for the latest four-point rise in the Labour Party's lead is not due to seasonal factors.

      "body": "<p>The United Nations has been hit by an unprecedented wave of fraud, waste and corruption. Officials at its antifraud investigation unit say they are expecting to have to run more than 350 inquiries by the end of the year - nearly twice the total for 1998, and a 50 per cent increase on last year. Thousands of staff, contractors and consultants have been interviewed in scores of countries.</p> <p>The revelations will embarrass Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, who is to welcome national leaders, including Tony Blair, to the 'Millennium Summit' in New York next week. The summit will be the biggest such meeting in the UN's history and Annan is hoping to convince sceptical heads of state that the UN has provided value for money and that its role should be expanded.</p> <p>One senior investigator said last week that the UN investigations unit's workload was greater than ever. 'We are seeing more and more frauds and abuses of authority... There is a huge range of things to look at,' she said.</p> <p>The alleged crimes being investigated by the unit, the Office of Internal Oversight Services, range from the petty - such as employees using UN offices to run their own businesses or using UN planes for personal travel - to the huge, such as million-dollar frauds.</p> <p>The OIOS's annual report, due out next month, will reveal cases of sloppy management, lax enforcement, harassment and outright criminality. Last year the OIOS conducted 247 inquiries and claimed to have saved the UN more than $23 million (\u00a315m). So far this year the unit has taken on 230 new investigations. It is working with dozens of international police forces - including Scotland Yard - on inquiries into the activities of United Nations personnel.</p> <p>In one major success this year a former UN official was jailed for<b> </b> three-and-a-half years for embezzling $770,000 (\u00a3513,000) while working in the former Yugoslavia. Charles Kim, a former chief of travel for the UN mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, worked with a local travel agency and an airline employee to falsify bills.</p> <p>In another case, $700,000 (\u00a3466,000) was recouped after it had been misdirected into a private individual's account by a bank.</p> <p>Other investigations have been into false claims of living allowances and education grants, the payment of $6m (\u00a34m) for sub-standard supplies in Angola, mismanagement of a number of conferences and alleged fraud by a contractors.</p> <p>The UN has been criticised for failing to tackle fraud and waste. The US government is refusing to pay more than about $1 billion until 'convincing measures' have been taken to improve the situation. The British Government has been similarly vocal in calling for reforms.</p> <p>A senior investigator at the OIOS said last week that, as the UN had expanded, so had the fraud and the waste. Much of the expansion has been in peacekeeping operations which now account for around a fifth of the OIOS's inquiries.</p> <p>The total budget for the UN for 2000-2001 is $2.53 bn (\u00a31.68 bn). In spite of this, resources for the OIOS have not been increased, officials claim.</p> <p>Peacekeeping operations are a focus of criticism. One recent independent report alleged that troops provided by member countries for peacekeeping missions were often inadequate. It said that, on occasion, they were unable to speak the language [of the country in which they were stationed] and totally under equipped.</p> <p>'Some countries have provided soldiers without rifles, or with rifles but no helmets, or with helmets but no flak jackets... This must stop,' the report said. It also criticised the peacekeeping support staff. This year's OIOS report is expected to criticise peacekeeping administrators for falling to process claims for remuneration by member states who have supplied troops for UN interventions. Around \u00a320m is owed to the UK.</p> <p>A former UN officials told The Observer that the UN has 'an absurd and unaccountable system of abuse, embezzlement and ineptitude'.</p> <p>Alan Parra, 39, who recently resigned his post as a senior official of the UN Commission for Human Rights, said: 'It's very difficult to dig out and punish abuse in an organisation where it is the norm. Of each dollar spent by the United Nations only an infinitesimal amount gets anywhere near the project on the ground.'</p> <p>Last year's report was one of the OIOS's most hard-hitting. It revealed appalling problems at the UN mission in Angola. Air tickets worth more than $1.7m had been bought without explanation or approval and multiple submissions of invoices had resulted in double payments worth $30,000 (\u00a320,000).</p> <p>The report also referred to delays at the mission in Haiti which cost the UN $7.7m (\u00a35.13m) and described how two fieldworkers on peace-keeping operations had successfully entered false benefit claims - for children and education - worth $196,000 (\u00a3130,000). A similar fraud was discovered in Nairobi.</p> <p>Last week Parra described a series of cases that included: assistants to a senior official based in another country not realising for more than a year that their superior had died; an official report on the human rights situation in Czechoslovakia, written by an overworked official by 'cutting and pasting' a report from Colombia.</p> <p>'It told us all about guerrillas and narco-traffickers. The words \"Czech Republic\" had just been pasted in,' Parra said.</p> <p>He also criticised 'an addiction to perks and luxury'. When one UN official in Rwanda had wanted to interview the Canadian general in charge of peacekeeping forces there he had been told to arrange an itinerary with stays on the way out and back in Brussels, Paris and Geneva, Parra claimed.</p> <p>In each of the cities the UN officials stay at, they pick up a daily subsistence rate that is sometimes worth more than \u00a3100.</p> <p>'Whenever I travelled I always came back with a few hundred dollars in extra cash,' admitted Parra, 'So God knows what kind of money the top officials are coming home with.

      "bodyText": "The United Nations has been hit by an unprecedented wave of fraud, waste and corruption. Officials at its antifraud investigation unit say they are expecting to have to run more than 350 inquiries by the end of the year - nearly twice the total for 1998, and a 50 per cent increase on last year. Thousands of staff, contractors and consultants have been interviewed in scores of countries. The revelations will embarrass Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, who is to welcome national leaders, including Tony Blair, to the 'Millennium Summit' in New York next week. The summit will be the biggest such meeting in the UN's history and Annan is hoping to convince sceptical heads of state that the UN has provided value for money and that its role should be expanded. One senior investigator said last week that the UN investigations unit's workload was greater than ever. 'We are seeing more and more frauds and abuses of authority... There is a huge range of things to look at,' she said. The alleged crimes being investigated by the unit, the Office of Internal Oversight Services, range from the petty - such as employees using UN offices to run their own businesses or using UN planes for personal travel - to the huge, such as million-dollar frauds. The OIOS's annual report, due out next month, will reveal cases of sloppy management, lax enforcement, harassment and outright criminality. Last year the OIOS conducted 247 inquiries and claimed to have saved the UN more than $23 million (\u00a315m). So far this year the unit has taken on 230 new investigations. It is working with dozens of international police forces - including Scotland Yard - on inquiries into the activities of United Nations personnel. In one major success this year a former UN official was jailed for three-and-a-half years for embezzling $770,000 (\u00a3513,000) while working in the former Yugoslavia. Charles Kim, a former chief of travel for the UN mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina, worked with a local travel agency and an airline employee to falsify bills. In another case, $700,000 (\u00a3466,000) was recouped after it had been misdirected into a private individual's account by a bank. Other investigations have been into false claims of living allowances and education grants, the payment of $6m (\u00a34m) for sub-standard supplies in Angola, mismanagement of a number of conferences and alleged fraud by a contractors. The UN has been criticised for failing to tackle fraud and waste. The US government is refusing to pay more than about $1 billion until 'convincing measures' have been taken to improve the situation. The British Government has been similarly vocal in calling for reforms. A senior investigator at the OIOS said last week that, as the UN had expanded, so had the fraud and the waste. Much of the expansion has been in peacekeeping operations which now account for around a fifth of the OIOS's inquiries. The total budget for the UN for 2000-2001 is $2.53 bn (\u00a31.68 bn). In spite of this, resources for the OIOS have not been increased, officials claim. Peacekeeping operations are a focus of criticism. One recent independent report alleged that troops provided by member countries for peacekeeping missions were often inadequate. It said that, on occasion, they were unable to speak the language [of the country in which they were stationed] and totally under equipped. 'Some countries have provided soldiers without rifles, or with rifles but no helmets, or with helmets but no flak jackets... This must stop,' the report said. It also criticised the peacekeeping support staff. This year's OIOS report is expected to criticise peacekeeping administrators for falling to process claims for remuneration by member states who have supplied troops for UN interventions. Around \u00a320m is owed to the UK. A former UN officials told The Observer that the UN has 'an absurd and unaccountable system of abuse, embezzlement and ineptitude'. Alan Parra, 39, who recently resigned his post as a senior official of the UN Commission for Human Rights, said: 'It's very difficult to dig out and punish abuse in an organisation where it is the norm. Of each dollar spent by the United Nations only an infinitesimal amount gets anywhere near the project on the ground.' Last year's report was one of the OIOS's most hard-hitting. It revealed appalling problems at the UN mission in Angola. Air tickets worth more than $1.7m had been bought without explanation or approval and multiple submissions of invoices had resulted in double payments worth $30,000 (\u00a320,000). The report also referred to delays at the mission in Haiti which cost the UN $7.7m (\u00a35.13m) and described how two fieldworkers on peace-keeping operations had successfully entered false benefit claims - for children and education - worth $196,000 (\u00a3130,000). A similar fraud was discovered in Nairobi. Last week Parra described a series of cases that included: assistants to a senior official based in another country not realising for more than a year that their superior had died; an official report on the human rights situation in Czechoslovakia, written by an overworked official by 'cutting and pasting' a report from Colombia. 'It told us all about guerrillas and narco-traffickers. The words \"Czech Republic\" had just been pasted in,' Parra said. He also criticised 'an addiction to perks and luxury'. When one UN official in Rwanda had wanted to interview the Canadian general in charge of peacekeeping forces there he had been told to arrange an itinerary with stays on the way out and back in Brussels, Paris and Geneva, Parra claimed. In each of the cities the UN officials stay at, they pick up a daily subsistence rate that is sometimes worth more than \u00a3100. 'Whenever I travelled I always came back with a few hundred dollars in extra cash,' admitted Parra, 'So God knows what kind of money the top officials are coming home with. Frankly, I was amazed.'",

      "body": "<p>Three times a week John Edward Robinson mowed the lawn outside his farmhouse and grilled hamburgers at the local cookout. That was the Robinson that his neighbours in the prairie town of Olathe, Kansas, saw. On the internet, however, he called himself The Slavemaster. </p> <p>To the FBI, Robinson has other names. He is emerging as a monster with two distinctions in the history of American crime: the Cyber Ripper - the first serial killer to lure his victims to their death by stalking them on the web. </p> <p>An even more grotesque detail has emerged in the case of the Kansas killer: one of the women he is accused of murdering left a daughter - who is now in her teens - who was adopted by Robinson's brother and raised in the family of her mother's killer. </p> <p>It is believed that the victims were killed because they had children. His motive was not only sado-sexual, but part of an adoption racket. </p> <p>Robinson was arrested in June after two women told the police that they had been assaulted and robbed by Robinson, having arranged meetings over the internet in order to have sado-masochistic sex. He was charged with sexual battery. </p> <p>The investigation was intensified after a Michigan woman, Suzette Trouten, was reported missing after leaving to work for Robinson. Meanwhile, a Texas woman said that she had escaped an attempted murder after meeting Robinson as the result of another internet rendezvous. </p> <p>The Robinson case then twisted into a nightmare: as the FBI began excavating his land in Linn County, Kansas, they found the rotting bodies of five women stashed into 55-gallon drums. Two of them were sitting in the yard, swathed in plastic.Three more bodies were discovered in a storage locker rented in Robinson's name. </p> <p>Two of the victims were a mother and daughter, Sheila and Deborah Faith. Deborah, a teenager, was disabled. The investigation revealed fake letters, received by relatives of the disappeared women and purportedly from them. One was sent to Mrs Faith's brother saying that Sheila had met a man from Australia who was taking her home 'to be happy'. </p> <p>Another letter written to the killer, by one of the women he had killed, Paula Godfrey, was addressed to John, and signed 'Love Ya, Paula'. The letter, found in a business associate's brief case, was a crucial piece in the jigsaw that led to Robinson's arrest. </p> <p>Most chilling of all was the addition to the indictment of a baby who went missing in the late 1980s. But even these investigations did not touch the bitter core of the case, the tragedy of Lisa Stasi and her daughter Tiffany. Tiffany Stasi was only a few months old when her mother - then aged 19 - disappeared in 1985. Lisa vanished after accepting a job with Robinson. Lisa was reported missing in January, 1985. </p> <p>The body of Lisa Stasi was never found, but the FBI added her name to a list of six women with whose murders Robinson is charged. </p> <p>Last week the FBI revealed that Tiffany had been adopted by a Midwestern couple who had changed her name to Tiffany Robinson. They were Robinson's brother and sister-in-law. </p> <p>All investigators would tell The Observer on Friday was that 'the inquiry obviously directs towards the adoptive family of the girl, who we have spoken to'. </p> <p>One FBI officer said: 'We shall be looking carefully at whether the other victims lured over the web or otherwise had children, and if so what happened to them.' </p> <p>But just to complete the drama, a bizarre reunion is now planned, whereby Tiffany will be reunited with her real father, pending a series of surreal DNA tests. </p> <p>Now that Robinson's brother has been accused as a party to the grotesque adoption, Kansas state law assigns responsibility for a minor to the widower of a dead woman.</p>",

That was the Robinson that his neighbours in the prairie town of Olathe, Kansas, saw. On the internet, however, he called himself The Slavemaster. To the FBI, Robinson has other names. He is emerging as a monster with two distinctions in the history of American crime: the Cyber Ripper - the first serial killer to lure his victims to their death by stalking them on the web. An even more grotesque detail has emerged in the case of the Kansas killer: one of the women he is accused of murdering left a daughter - who is now in her teens - who was adopted by Robinson's brother and raised in the family of her mother's killer. It is believed that the victims were killed because they had children. His motive was not only sado-sexual, but part of an adoption racket. Robinson was arrested in June after two women told the police that they had been assaulted and robbed by Robinson, having arranged meetings over the internet in order to have sado-masochistic sex. He was charged with sexual battery. The investigation was intensified after a Michigan woman, Suzette Trouten, was reported missing after leaving to work for Robinson. Meanwhile, a Texas woman said that she had escaped an attempted murder after meeting Robinson as the result of another internet rendezvous. The Robinson case then twisted into a nightmare: as the FBI began excavating his land in Linn County, Kansas, they found the rotting bodies of five women stashed into 55-gallon drums. Two of them were sitting in the yard, swathed in plastic.Three more bodies were discovered in a storage locker rented in Robinson's name. Two of the victims were a mother and daughter, Sheila and Deborah Faith. Deborah, a teenager, was disabled. The investigation revealed fake letters, received by relatives of the disappeared women and purportedly from them. One was sent to Mrs Faith's brother saying that Sheila had met a man from Australia who was taking her home 'to be happy'. Another letter written to the killer, by one of the women he had killed, Paula Godfrey, was addressed to John, and signed 'Love Ya, Paula'. The letter, found in a business associate's brief case, was a crucial piece in the jigsaw that led to Robinson's arrest. Most chilling of all was the addition to the indictment of a baby who went missing in the late 1980s. But even these investigations did not touch the bitter core of the case, the tragedy of Lisa Stasi and her daughter Tiffany. Tiffany Stasi was only a few months old when her mother - then aged 19 - disappeared in 1985. Lisa vanished after accepting a job with Robinson. Lisa was reported missing in January, 1985. The body of Lisa Stasi was never found, but the FBI added her name to a list of six women with whose murders Robinson is charged. Last week the FBI revealed that Tiffany had been adopted by a Midwestern couple who had changed her name to Tiffany Robinson. They were Robinson's brother and sister-in-law. All investigators would tell The Observer on Friday was that 'the inquiry obviously directs towards the adoptive family of the girl, who we have spoken to'. One FBI officer said: 'We shall be looking carefully at whether the other victims lured over the web or otherwise had children, and if so what happened to them.' But just to complete the drama, a bizarre reunion is now planned, whereby Tiffany will be reunited with her real father, pending a series of surreal DNA tests. Now that Robinson's brother has been accused as a party to the grotesque adoption, Kansas state law assigns responsibility for a minor to the widower of a dead woman.",

'Like the scale of the fish. That's best Colombiano.' It is two days before President Bill Clinton's historic visit to the picturesque city on Colombia's Caribbean coast.

You can afford it.' In the next few weeks the Clinton administration will begin releasing the first instalment in a $1.3 billion package of aid designed to eradicate the production of the coca leaf in Colombia for ever. At a press conference in Cartagena last Wednesday Clinton insisted his 'Plan Colombia' funds were to be used to train Colombian anti-narcotics brigades, not to escalate the war between the army and the Fuerza Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), the Marxist guerillas who control the area of southern Colombia where most of the cocaine destined for consumption in the US and Europe is produced.</p> <p>But those who have studied coca production in Colombia argue that the aid package flies in the face of history and economics.</p> <p>'It's prohibition in all but name,' says Jesus Idrobo, a taxonomist at the Botanical Gardens in Bogota and an expert on the coca leaf. 'The campesinos depend on the coca leaf for their livelihood. As long as they can make more money from coca production [than from other crops] you will never eradicate it.' According to Idrobo one hectare of coca produces about two kilograms of coca leaves every three months, or six kilos a year. To add value to their crop, the campesinos press and refine the leaves into a crude block, known as 'pasta' which they sell on to the cartels. For every kilo of coca paste they manufacture the campesinos can expect to receive $32,000 from the drug gangs.</p> <p>'That's enough to live well for several years,' explains Idrobo. 'What other crop can provide a similar rate of return?' Several years ago, Idrobo says, the US approached the botanical gardens with a request to release a fungus - fussarium oxysporum - that devours coca leaves. However, the plan was ruled out on the grounds that the fungus might also take over legal plantations, destroying leaves that ordinary Colombians depend on for a daily source of nutrition. 'Do you realise that the coca leaf contains a higher percentage of vitamins and minerals than any of the 52 other food plants grown in Colombia?' says Idrobo. 'Coca-chewing goes back 2,000 years to before the conquest.

The leaves were the product of the tri-annual harvest in Caguan, a department 450 kilometres south of Bogota in the de-militarised zone. In Caguan coca has become the motor of the local economy and the main source of arms for the guerillas. According to the latest US intelligence reports, Caguan produces 13,000 hectares of coca a year, or 75 tons of cocaine.

I take a step back to make sure I have heard him correctly. We are not, as far as I know, anywhere near La Boquilla, the village where they land most of the fish consumed in the fancy hotels in Cartagena and Bocagrande. The man leaning against the wall is definitely not a fishmonger. 'See how the light catches the flakes, mon,' he says, opening the paper wrapper concealed in his hand. 'Like the scale of the fish. That's best Colombiano.' It is two days before President Bill Clinton's historic visit to the picturesque city on Colombia's Caribbean coast. Cartagena is crawling with US secret service agents, White House advance staff and Colombian anti-terrorist police, yet a Rastafarian is offering to sell me a gramme of 80 per cent pure Colombian cocaine. 'Only 10,000 pesos - five dollars, mon. You can afford it.' In the next few weeks the Clinton administration will begin releasing the first instalment in a $1.3 billion package of aid designed to eradicate the production of the coca leaf in Colombia for ever. At a press conference in Cartagena last Wednesday Clinton insisted his 'Plan Colombia' funds were to be used to train Colombian anti-narcotics brigades, not to escalate the war between the army and the Fuerza Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), the Marxist guerillas who control the area of southern Colombia where most of the cocaine destined for consumption in the US and Europe is produced.

      "trailText": "As the Tories launch their pre-election manifesto, it's not sycophancy the Government needs, just recognition for what it has achieved",
      "byline": "Peter Hain",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>With the Tories launching their 'pre-election manifesto' on Tuesday, it's beginning to be make-your-mind-up time about a second Labour term of government. Yet I still find some surliness among those with whom I marched - either actually or metaphorically - in various struggles for freedom and justice from the late Sixties onward. Perhaps I am different. I was never an all-or-nothing person; rather an all-or-something person.</p> <p>There is an endemic culture of betrayal in progressive circles. Leaders are always accused of selling out. For some, being in opposition is actually easier. It is rather comfortable, just attacking the Tories. You don't have to make tough choices, face difficult compromises, grapple with the detail, answer awkward questions, or win the subsequent argument with voters.</p> <p>The progressive media tend to be similarly afflicted. Take a recent Guardian headline: 'Labour ditches ethical arms trade bill.' Simply not true. The Bill is in draft and we remain committed to it. We may or may not get our tougher controls on arms exports enacted before the next general election. That will depend on when it is and on how we manage the enormous pressure on parliamentary business.</p> <p>A Guardian headline focusing on that would have been explaining the truth to its readers, but it wouldn't have been as attention-grabbing, would it? I wonder whether the real spin doctors these days are the journalists.</p> <p>Where has it ever been properly reported that this Labour Government has made our arms exports more accountable and transparent than almost any other country, with annual reports of 300 pages detailing the licences we have agreed? That we have established for the first time a tough code blocking exports of arms for either internal repression or external aggression, and a European Union arms code doing the same thing?</p> <p>With Labour, Britain has been doing more to promote arms control than any previous Government and certainly any likely alternative: by banning land mines and the sale of torture equipment, promoting a ban on small arms to conflict zones, ratifying the nuclear Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and pressing for effective implementation of the Biological and Chemicals Weapons Treaties.</p> <p>At the Non-Proliferation Treaty conference in New York in May, we played the key role in achieving an unprecedented agreement to the global elimination of nuclear weapons. I accept that may not satisfy unilateral disarmers. But instead of complaining about Government 'betrayal', they should acknowledge we have a bloody good record on disarmament and re-double their efforts to press us for improvements. If people want us to do more, then stick by us and we will deliver more: but don't overlook or try to deny what we have done already.</p> <p>We will soon have increased our overseas aid and development budget by a massive 72 per cent in real terms, reversing savage Tory cuts. And we have led the way on providing 100 per cent debt relief for the poorest countries.</p> <p>Pretty well everywhere in the world, I find that Labour's foreign policy is admired as progressive, modern and on the side of justice, human rights and freedom - in stark contrast to the Tories.</p> <p>So we should reject the cynical view that, because we cannot make the world perfect, we should stop trying to make it better. Because we cannot do everything, does not mean we should do nothing. For instance, acknowledgement of our military intervention to stop atrocities in Sierra Leone should not be withheld because we were unable to prevent atrocities in Chechnya.</p> <p>Much the same story applies to domestic policy. Of course there is pressure for the minimum wage to be higher. But from some of the grudging gripes about its level you would never have imagined that Tony Blair has achieved the 100-year dream of Keir Hardie, nor that 1.5 million workers, overwhelmingly women, have benefited. Although \u00a33.60 an hour may not seem much, it has doubled the income of some of my South Wales constituents.</p> <p>And don't we deserve at least some credit for establishing the minimum wage with hardly a murmur from a previously hostile business world, and in defiance of all those Tory scares about millions of job losses?</p> <p>Again, instead of sneering about the Government only looking after 'middle England', why not acknowledge our attack on poverty? It's only a beginning. But our Tax Credit reforms mean that no family with someone at work will be on less than \u00a310,000 a year, benefiting nearly one and a half million families, some hugely.</p> <p>You cannot turn everything around in three years after 18 destructive Tory ones. But wouldn't Clement Attlee and Nye Bevan have been proud to have one million more people in work since the general election? Or to have got more than 200,000 young people off the dole and into work through the Government's 'New Deal' programme? Some people might even call that a 'socialist' policy - but then that really would be giving us too much credit, wouldn't it?</p> <p>And on the economy, some take it as a badge of final betrayal that Labour enjoys the confidence of the markets, business and the City - as if it is better to have IMF crises, high inflation, runs on the pound and the general impression Labour couldn't run a whelk stall, let alone the country. Bring back the good old days of Labour governments - without exception, until now - running into an economic crisis and then losing the election afterwards. Much better to feel pure, than achieve the kind of economic stability which is now allowing us to expand and invest rather than retrench and cut.</p> <p>Hard decisions were taken to achieve this stability. Financing record Government borrowing cost taxpayers \u00a328 billion a year under the Tories, more than was being spent on schools. Reducing public borrowing and the national debt means Government interest payments on the national debt are down a whacking \u00a34 billion annually - money we are now spending on education, health and other public services, instead of throwing away to the capital markets. Low inflation and reduced borrowing also mean historically low interest rates, benefiting home owners and businesses alike.</p> <p>The truth is, we are more progressive than any previous British Government, on tackling poverty, on far-reaching constitutional reform, on record investment in education, health and infrastructure - and, yes, on promoting international human rights and justice too.</p> <p>Of course there is a lot more to do. As everyone knows from their own daily lives, changing things can take a long time. Ahead lies the great prize of being able to do all the things that Labour supporters really want us to do - and which we will do, step by step - if we win that historically unprecedented second full Labour term. We do not want another century like the last one, dominated by Tory governments.</p> <p>But this is not a plea from a Minister for sycophancy or blind loyalty. Merely for fairness, instead of corrosive cynicism. Yes, the Government must be held accountable, especially if we make mistakes. But our considerable achievements should be recognised too. And the alternative of an extreme right Tory administration never forgotten.</p> <p>\u0095 Peter Hain is Minister of State at the Foreign Office and MP for Neath</p>",

      "bodyText": "With the Tories launching their 'pre-election manifesto' on Tuesday, it's beginning to be make-your-mind-up time about a second Labour term of government. Yet I still find some surliness among those with whom I marched - either actually or metaphorically - in various struggles for freedom and justice from the late Sixties onward. Perhaps I am different. I was never an all-or-nothing person; rather an all-or-something person. There is an endemic culture of betrayal in progressive circles. Leaders are always accused of selling out. For some, being in opposition is actually easier. It is rather comfortable, just attacking the Tories. You don't have to make tough choices, face difficult compromises, grapple with the detail, answer awkward questions, or win the subsequent argument with voters. The progressive media tend to be similarly afflicted. Take a recent Guardian headline: 'Labour ditches ethical arms trade bill.' Simply not true. The Bill is in draft and we remain committed to it. We may or may not get our tougher controls on arms exports enacted before the next general election. That will depend on when it is and on how we manage the enormous pressure on parliamentary business. A Guardian headline focusing on that would have been explaining the truth to its readers, but it wouldn't have been as attention-grabbing, would it? I wonder whether the real spin doctors these days are the journalists. Where has it ever been properly reported that this Labour Government has made our arms exports more accountable and transparent than almost any other country, with annual reports of 300 pages detailing the licences we have agreed? That we have established for the first time a tough code blocking exports of arms for either internal repression or external aggression, and a European Union arms code doing the same thing? With Labour, Britain has been doing more to promote arms control than any previous Government and certainly any likely alternative: by banning land mines and the sale of torture equipment, promoting a ban on small arms to conflict zones, ratifying the nuclear Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and pressing for effective implementation of the Biological and Chemicals Weapons Treaties. At the Non-Proliferation Treaty conference in New York in May, we played the key role in achieving an unprecedented agreement to the global elimination of nuclear weapons. I accept that may not satisfy unilateral disarmers. But instead of complaining about Government 'betrayal', they should acknowledge we have a bloody good record on disarmament and re-double their efforts to press us for improvements. If people want us to do more, then stick by us and we will deliver more: but don't overlook or try to deny what we have done already. We will soon have increased our overseas aid and development budget by a massive 72 per cent in real terms, reversing savage Tory cuts. And we have led the way on providing 100 per cent debt relief for the poorest countries. Pretty well everywhere in the world, I find that Labour's foreign policy is admired as progressive, modern and on the side of justice, human rights and freedom - in stark contrast to the Tories. So we should reject the cynical view that, because we cannot make the world perfect, we should stop trying to make it better. Because we cannot do everything, does not mean we should do nothing. For instance, acknowledgement of our military intervention to stop atrocities in Sierra Leone should not be withheld because we were unable to prevent atrocities in Chechnya. Much the same story applies to domestic policy. Of course there is pressure for the minimum wage to be higher. But from some of the grudging gripes about its level you would never have imagined that Tony Blair has achieved the 100-year dream of Keir Hardie, nor that 1.5 million workers, overwhelmingly women, have benefited. Although \u00a33.60 an hour may not seem much, it has doubled the income of some of my South Wales constituents. And don't we deserve at least some credit for establishing the minimum wage with hardly a murmur from a previously hostile business world, and in defiance of all those Tory scares about millions of job losses? Again, instead of sneering about the Government only looking after 'middle England', why not acknowledge our attack on poverty? It's only a beginning. But our Tax Credit reforms mean that no family with someone at work will be on less than \u00a310,000 a year, benefiting nearly one and a half million families, some hugely. You cannot turn everything around in three years after 18 destructive Tory ones. But wouldn't Clement Attlee and Nye Bevan have been proud to have one million more people in work since the general election? Or to have got more than 200,000 young people off the dole and into work through the Government's 'New Deal' programme? Some people might even call that a 'socialist' policy - but then that really would be giving us too much credit, wouldn't it? And on the economy, some take it as a badge of final betrayal that Labour enjoys the confidence of the markets, business and the City - as if it is better to have IMF crises, high inflation, runs on the pound and the general impression Labour couldn't run a whelk stall, let alone the country. Bring back the good old days of Labour governments - without exception, until now - running into an economic crisis and then losing the election afterwards. Much better to feel pure, than achieve the kind of economic stability which is now allowing us to expand and invest rather than retrench and cut. Hard decisions were taken to achieve this stability. Financing record Government borrowing cost taxpayers \u00a328 billion a year under the Tories, more than was being spent on schools. Reducing public borrowing and the national debt means Government interest payments on the national debt are down a whacking \u00a34 billion annually - money we are now spending on education, health and other public services, instead of throwing away to the capital markets. Low inflation and reduced borrowing also mean historically low interest rates, benefiting home owners and businesses alike. The truth is, we are more progressive than any previous British Government, on tackling poverty, on far-reaching constitutional reform, on record investment in education, health and infrastructure - and, yes, on promoting international human rights and justice too. Of course there is a lot more to do. As everyone knows from their own daily lives, changing things can take a long time. Ahead lies the great prize of being able to do all the things that Labour supporters really want us to do - and which we will do, step by step - if we win that historically unprecedented second full Labour term. We do not want another century like the last one, dominated by Tory governments. But this is not a plea from a Minister for sycophancy or blind loyalty. Merely for fairness, instead of corrosive cynicism. Yes, the Government must be held accountable, especially if we make mistakes. But our considerable achievements should be recognised too. And the alternative of an extreme right Tory administration never forgotten. \u0095 Peter Hain is Minister of State at the Foreign Office and MP for Neath",

Next to the arresting image, portrayed on 15-foot-high posters across the country, are the words: 'Visible Quickie, Invisible Deodorant.' The Sure ad was created by an all-woman team at the Lowe Lintas agency, and is the first in a campaign which will become increasingly provocative, according to industry sources. </p> <p>Sex, so the ad mantra goes, sells.

It gets the ad talked about. Look at the Wonderbra campaign. That didn't have a lot of money behind it,' said Lucy Banister, managing director of Davies Riley-Smith Maclay, advertising research specialists. </p> <p>The Wonderbra team cleverly exploited the fact that posters are a public medium reaching a universal audience, in contrast to, say, a campaign in a glossy magazine which targets a particular segment of the consumer population - who may not be offended by the ad.

'Viral marketing', the ad industry calls it. </p> <p>The most obvious example of this approach is the Organics shampoo campaign currently causing the Advertising Standards Authority a headache.

'The first thing an ad must do is communicate the brand. The second thing is to create saliency in the marketplace. This ad aims to shock, not titillate. You have to ask, is it aimed at women? It just generates a certain amount of talk rather than communicating anything.' </p> <p>One of the problems is that many others are also playing the game. Sex to shock seems to be an emerging theme with which authorities are having to grapple. Last year for instance, the ASA - which looks into 12,000 cases a year, a quarter of which relate to taste and decency - investigated complaints about an Irn-Bru poster ad. The poster featured a baby happily suckling on a breast under the strapline: 'Looks like mum's been on the Irn-Bru.' </p> <p>A current campaign for Bargain Holidays features a pair of tanned, naked buttocks boasting the pale outline of skin that has been covered by a minuscule thong.

The ASA is also investigating this ad. </p> <p>'Poster ads have definitely become more daring than they used to be. They're more explicit. A few years ago you wouldn't have got ads featuring a woman's bare buttocks,' said Banister. </p> <p>But, given the way the ad agencies seem close to exhausting the last taboos, some industry experts argue many campaigns are finding it difficult to differentiate their brands in a jostling market place. 'Everything blurs into one. If everyone's using shock tactics how do you distinguish? I don't think we've got to the stage yet where some products are advertised in a completely indistinguishable way, but we will,' Banister said. </p> <p>The use of sex in poster campaigns in an increasingly unsubtle way is partly a reaction to a changing culture. The billboard campaigns are merely catching up with other advertising media. 'You just have to look at Channel 5 or satellite TV which are showing risqu\u00e9 programmes. There is a general feeling that it is acceptable to shock as long as it's not totally gratuitous,' McCabe said. </p> <p>The UK is becoming more continental in its advertising norms, he said. 'You look at the French market and you can see we're incredibly uptight and conservative. It's the same in Italy and Germany where it's acceptable to show a naked breast.

'We don't believe that all publicity is good publicity. We're not trying to cause offence to get column inches. That could end up being very harmful to the brand.' </p> <p>Ultimately it is the brand, not how much the chattering classes discuss a particular ad, that matters. There are some spectacular examples where companies have confused this truism.

Perhaps it is time he stopped talking targets and started meeting them. Judging by the performance of the first half he has some way to go. </p> <p>The core businesses such as pest control, plant care and security - those Thompson is relying on to meet his targets - managed to grow sales by a miserly 1.9 per cent.

But he is promising that the results will be evident by the end of the year. </p> <p>Let's hope the results are better than those from a previous big initiative, dropping contracts in its facilities management business which produced high sales but low margins. </p> <p>That started last year, so margins this year would be expected to benefit. Instead, they fell by more than a quarter because, Thompson admits, Rentokil omitted to shed all the costs of carrying out the work as well as the contracts themselves. The error, he promises, is now being corrected. </p> <p>But Thompson's biggest problem is that the City no longer believes his promises. He only admitted that the 20 per cent target was too ambitious after Rentokil had failed to achieve it and he still seems to take a more optimistic view of its prospects than some in the City. </p> <p>The clearest example is on margins, where he thinks they will 'at least stand still, if not grow' because it is so skilled in keeping ahead of the competition. </p> <p>He may be proved right next year but the results of this year and last suggest he is deluding himself. </p> <p>Contrast that with Hays, a rival services group, which also announced results last year. Its chairman, Ronnie Frost, doubtless has targets for the business but he is sensible enough to keep them for internal consumption. He is also likely to adjust them regularly to take account of the changing economic climate. </p> <p>Unlike Rentokil, so far Hays has managed to maintain its unbroken record of profits growth. Last year, sales grew by an underlying 13 per cent while profits rose 14 per cent. </p> <p>Rentokil talks about offering an integrated service to customers, including such things as subcontracting out tasks such as lift maintenance, which it does not do itself. Hays has been getting on and doing it - and winning new customers into the bargain. </p> <p>The key questions, however, are whether Hays can carry on growing sales, and whether Rentokil can get its sales rising again. </p> <p>The City is constantly bracing itself for a slowdown in Hays' growth rates but so far its fears have proved groundless. Indeed Thompson says new business prospects are 'the strongest in our history' and is clear about his targets . </p> <p>Thompson is now giving Rentokil his full attention, having ended his stint as head of the Confederation of British Industry. But that may not be enough to meet his targets. </p> <p>The difference in ratings is equally stark. Hays commands a premium 30 times prospective earnings, Rentokil a bargain 10 times. The former is, however, the better buy. </p> <p><strong> Burnishing metal</strong></p> <p>If you are feeling rather breathless about the pace of activity at Billiton then get into training now: there is likely to be lots more activity ahead.

Burnishing metal If you are feeling rather breathless about the pace of activity at Billiton then get into training now: there is likely to be lots more activity ahead. The metals and mining industry, once as inert as platinum, is showing a long overdue conversion to shareholder value. Billiton chairman Brian Gilbertson summed this up last week when he talked of 'unparalleled consolidation' in the industry 'with smaller companies disappearing and the larger ones growing in size and influence'.

The former gives Billiton its first major stake in the copper industry, the latter achieves its goal of running an alumina refinery. Underlying all the deals, however, is a new focus on the need to maximise shareholder returns. While the industry will always be at the mercy of the commodity price cycle, there is much that can be done to improve efficiency and cut operating costs. Of course, mines will always need people, there is scope for sharing facilities such as railways, or for accessing cheaper power or getting closer to market - and just cutting head-office costs from some of the smaller mining companies can reap savings. At the heart of the activity - which is being mirrored at both Rio Tinto and Anglo American - is the desire to smooth out the cyclical peaks and troughs and to make the shares more attractive to investors weary of years of mediocre performance. The sharp fall in Billiton's price last week does not necessarily mean it has failed: it simply reflects concern about the pace of change and the need to absorb the $750 million worth of shares being placed to help finance the two deals. Despite that blip, the shares have recovered strongly from last year's trough.

      "body": "<p><strong> What's the problem?</strong><br> </p> <p>This levy is one of the most unpopular government policies among businesses, and perhaps the key factor blamed for the cooling of relations between New Labour and UK plc. Notable recent objections have come from the Confederation of British Industry, the Engineering Employers' Federation, the British Chambers of Commerce and energy-intensive companies such as the steel giant Corus and industrial gas producer BOC. Last week, the Shadow Chancellor Michael Portillo pledged to abolish the tax, if he gets the chance. </p> <p><strong> Why is the government doing it?</strong><br> </p> <p>Labour has been keen to display its green credentials. At the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, developed countries agreed to a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. The Kyoto summit in 1997 called for further cuts between 2008 and 2012. Britain wants to be seen at the forefront. As the Treasury states: 'The levy will not only reduce the UK's emissions of carbon dioxide, but will also help stimulate energy efficiency across the business and public sectors.' The levy is expected to reduce carbon emissions by 5 million tonnes a year 2010. </p> <p><strong> How does it work?</strong><br> </p> <p>The tax is levied on companies' energy use. It will be levied in units of kilowatt hours, with different rates applied to the various energy sources. These are 0.07p a unit for liquefied petroleum gas, 0.15p per unit for coal and gas and 0.43p a unit for electricity from the grid. The tax overall will be 'revenue neutral' - meaning that the Government will not make anything from it because what is taken - an estimated \u00a31 billion - will be refunded through rebates on companies' National Insurance contributions. It is due to be implemented in April 2001. </p> <p><strong> When did the trouble start? </strong><br> </p> <p>Early complaints came from the intensive energy users, such as the steel, glass, paper, cement and chemicals industries. They said they stood to lose millions and would not recoup it through National Insurance rebates because their companies were capital-intensive rather than labour-intensive. The Government responded by offering reductions in the levy of up to 80 per cent to energy-intensive companies which introduce energy saving measures into their processes. </p> <p><strong> Why the latest difficulties?</strong><br> </p> <p>Negotiations between trade associations, companies and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on the 80 per cent reductions are proving tortuous. They are likely to drag past the end of October - when the DETR wants them wrapped up - and therefore threaten the April introduc tion date.

      "bodyText": "What's the problem? This levy is one of the most unpopular government policies among businesses, and perhaps the key factor blamed for the cooling of relations between New Labour and UK plc. Notable recent objections have come from the Confederation of British Industry, the Engineering Employers' Federation, the British Chambers of Commerce and energy-intensive companies such as the steel giant Corus and industrial gas producer BOC. Last week, the Shadow Chancellor Michael Portillo pledged to abolish the tax, if he gets the chance. Why is the government doing it? Labour has been keen to display its green credentials. At the Earth Summit in Rio in 1992, developed countries agreed to a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2000. The Kyoto summit in 1997 called for further cuts between 2008 and 2012. Britain wants to be seen at the forefront. As the Treasury states: 'The levy will not only reduce the UK's emissions of carbon dioxide, but will also help stimulate energy efficiency across the business and public sectors.' The levy is expected to reduce carbon emissions by 5 million tonnes a year 2010. How does it work? The tax is levied on companies' energy use. It will be levied in units of kilowatt hours, with different rates applied to the various energy sources. These are 0.07p a unit for liquefied petroleum gas, 0.15p per unit for coal and gas and 0.43p a unit for electricity from the grid. The tax overall will be 'revenue neutral' - meaning that the Government will not make anything from it because what is taken - an estimated \u00a31 billion - will be refunded through rebates on companies' National Insurance contributions. It is due to be implemented in April 2001. When did the trouble start? Early complaints came from the intensive energy users, such as the steel, glass, paper, cement and chemicals industries. They said they stood to lose millions and would not recoup it through National Insurance rebates because their companies were capital-intensive rather than labour-intensive. The Government responded by offering reductions in the levy of up to 80 per cent to energy-intensive companies which introduce energy saving measures into their processes. Why the latest difficulties? Negotiations between trade associations, companies and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on the 80 per cent reductions are proving tortuous. They are likely to drag past the end of October - when the DETR wants them wrapped up - and therefore threaten the April introduc tion date. The CBI said last month that details of the tax were in such a mess that its introduction ought to be delayed. for a year to allow them to be sorted out. Further problems have come from energy intensive companies not entitled to negotiate reduction agreements. BOC, for example, is not included. Neither are some glass and steelmaking processes which involve recycling This is because the only individual sites that will qualify are those covered by the EU Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control directive. Some companies - particularly chemicals producers - say this is an arbitrary method of selection and is discriminatory. They say it focuses rebates on the heaviest polluters, and does not reward environmentally-friendly practices such as recycling. Has the EU stuck its oar in? Yes. The Competition Commissioner Mario Monti needs convincing that the tax and its exemptions do not breach European regulations on state aid. What next? Those taking part in the negotiations hope for a resolution. Those outside them hope to become involved in them. Everyone wants to avoid court. But there are already murmurings about m' learned friends.",

And last week he gunned it right up the Thames and fired an \u00a3800 million high explosive shot across the bow of the London Stock Exchange and its controversial planned merger with Frankfurt's Deutsche Borse to form iX, a pan-European exchange to challenge mighty New York. </p> <p>Right now, OM's intervention looks a mismatch - more like Hagar the Horrible wagging a finger at St George than the Ragnar who held the Saxons to ransom. Certainly, the big City power brokers dismiss Stenhammar's broadside as little more than a sideshow. </p> <p>'We, certainly, are not taking the OM bid seriously,' says one of Europe's few champions in global merchant banking. </p> <p>One of Wall Street's elite says sniffily: 'Yes, OM's intervention is entertaining, but ultimately it will prove to be irrelevant.' </p> <p>But OM's torpedo has nonetheless been well-aimed. For starters, the Swedes have already forced the Stock Exchange to do what much of the market had been screaming for since the iX merger was first announced in May: postpone this month's final vote until crucial details were settled to almost everyone's satisfaction. Last week, too late, the exchange went a long way towards satisfying the concerns of the UK's smaller stockbrokers by slashing the costs of clearing and settling iX share deals. </p> <p>But other fundamental concerns remain, such as which firms will be regulated where, and whether the needs of firms outside the top 300 European elite or the sexy hi-tech arena will be neglected. The Swedish bid has also rekindled patriotic doubts about iX. Put simply, OM wants to run London for London, to use its reputation to take on the world without fancy alliances full of cross-border compromises. The iX merger, though a 50/50 deal, is a barely disguised German takeover, reflecting the fact that Frankfurt has stolen a march in promoting hi-tech firms and dealing in modern financial instruments like futures, options and derivatives. </p> <p>'London has already got all the assets and a wonderful brand name. Why make it complicated?' asks Magnus Karlsson Bocker, OM's deputy chief executive. 'London needs new management. It has all the features of a successful market, yet they were about to give it away.' </p> <p>But, beyond the tit-for-tat about whose vision is best, OM's opportunism has also wholly changed the game. Its formal offer last Tuesday stripped away the London Stock Exchange's mystique as a venerated bastion of the British Establishment. Twenty tightly argued pages consigned 300 years of history to the dustbin. Since it demutualised in July, the Stock Exchange is now a plc whose shares can be bought and sold. As it has also been robbed of its traditional regulatory powers by the new Financial Services Authority, the exchange is now nothing more than a commercial enterprise, subject to the same laws of the jungle. </p> <p>Once upon a time, exchanges were supposed to police hostile bids, not be on the receiving end of them. But no longer. It wasn't part of the plan, but OM's disrespect now threatens to open the floodgates to all manner of Huns, Gauls and Americans mounting a takeover disguised as 'white knights'. Last week, the exchange went into a huddle with Deutsche Borse and its other allies in Spain and Italy who have talked about a consortium bid. </p> <p>The troublesome French - who have their own alliance with the Dutch and Belgians called Euronext - have already been sniffing. And for many, a possible bid by New York's Nasdaq exchange would have poetic symmetry. </p> <p>'First, because of British banks' awful management, the Americans have practically bought the City since Big Bang,' one senior broker said. 'Now, for the much the same reason, they might very well buy our exchange.' </p> <p>The irony is that this is a bid most of British industry would relish. Captains of commerce have long slated the City for its short-termism in selling them out to the highest bidder. For most stock exchange shareholders, however, price is very much secondary. As users of the market, what happens to the exchange affects their whole livelihood. It has, therefore, a long-termist shareholder register of which most companies can only dream. </p> <p>It is this reality, too, which is most likely to scupper the Swedes. For the notion of iX has been driven by pressure from the big investment banks to consolidate Europe's small exchanges so that they can deal as easily across this continent as they can America. But, through the size of their holdings (see left), Britain's smaller brokers have an effective veto. </p> <p>So far they have been the most vocal in criticising the ham-fisted way the exchange has simply sought to bulldoze iX through. OM has not only put a rocket up the exchange. It has left the small fry better placed to exact their own price for iX.</p>",

For starters, the Swedes have already forced the Stock Exchange to do what much of the market had been screaming for since the iX merger was first announced in May: postpone this month's final vote until crucial details were settled to almost everyone's satisfaction. Last week, too late, the exchange went a long way towards satisfying the concerns of the UK's smaller stockbrokers by slashing the costs of clearing and settling iX share deals. But other fundamental concerns remain, such as which firms will be regulated where, and whether the needs of firms outside the top 300 European elite or the sexy hi-tech arena will be neglected. The Swedish bid has also rekindled patriotic doubts about iX. Put simply, OM wants to run London for London, to use its reputation to take on the world without fancy alliances full of cross-border compromises. The iX merger, though a 50/50 deal, is a barely disguised German takeover, reflecting the fact that Frankfurt has stolen a march in promoting hi-tech firms and dealing in modern financial instruments like futures, options and derivatives. 'London has already got all the assets and a wonderful brand name. Why make it complicated?' asks Magnus Karlsson Bocker, OM's deputy chief executive. 'London needs new management. It has all the features of a successful market, yet they were about to give it away.' But, beyond the tit-for-tat about whose vision is best, OM's opportunism has also wholly changed the game. Its formal offer last Tuesday stripped away the London Stock Exchange's mystique as a venerated bastion of the British Establishment. Twenty tightly argued pages consigned 300 years of history to the dustbin. Since it demutualised in July, the Stock Exchange is now a plc whose shares can be bought and sold. As it has also been robbed of its traditional regulatory powers by the new Financial Services Authority, the exchange is now nothing more than a commercial enterprise, subject to the same laws of the jungle. Once upon a time, exchanges were supposed to police hostile bids, not be on the receiving end of them. But no longer. It wasn't part of the plan, but OM's disrespect now threatens to open the floodgates to all manner of Huns, Gauls and Americans mounting a takeover disguised as 'white knights'. Last week, the exchange went into a huddle with Deutsche Borse and its other allies in Spain and Italy who have talked about a consortium bid. The troublesome French - who have their own alliance with the Dutch and Belgians called Euronext - have already been sniffing. And for many, a possible bid by New York's Nasdaq exchange would have poetic symmetry. 'First, because of British banks' awful management, the Americans have practically bought the City since Big Bang,' one senior broker said. 'Now, for the much the same reason, they might very well buy our exchange.' The irony is that this is a bid most of British industry would relish. Captains of commerce have long slated the City for its short-termism in selling them out to the highest bidder. For most stock exchange shareholders, however, price is very much secondary. As users of the market, what happens to the exchange affects their whole livelihood. It has, therefore, a long-termist shareholder register of which most companies can only dream. It is this reality, too, which is most likely to scupper the Swedes. For the notion of iX has been driven by pressure from the big investment banks to consolidate Europe's small exchanges so that they can deal as easily across this continent as they can America. But, through the size of their holdings (see left), Britain's smaller brokers have an effective veto. So far they have been the most vocal in criticising the ham-fisted way the exchange has simply sought to bulldoze iX through. OM has not only put a rocket up the exchange. It has left the small fry better placed to exact their own price for iX.",

      "body": "<p>At absolutely no one's request, we hereby announce the winners of Inside corporate America's first annual Golden Vulture Awards: </p> <p> <strong> The Call-My-Lawyer Award to... Sony Corporation.</strong> </p> <p> Only last month, Sony and other media giants won a court injunction in the US against Napster, the website that lets you record music CDs off the internet. </p> <p>Sony concedes that Napster doesn't actually steal the music - individuals use Napster technology to trade tracks. </p> <p>However, the recording industry seeks ruinous damages against Napster on grounds that the website's technology knowingly abets copyright infringement. </p> <p>Forget Napster, Sony. You now face an even bigger threat of music filching. One company has just begun to market a device just like a Walkman which the manufacturer openly advertises as making it 'easy to record music off the internet'. The music-snatching machine is made by, uh, Sony. Sony should sue. </p> <p> <strong> The Four's-A-Crowd Award to ... Sony Corporation.</strong> </p> <p> It could be that the world's skint youth pilfers music off Napster because of the stratospheric prices of CDs in stores. </p> <p>This column suggested (and Italian and US trustbusters agree) that suspiciously high CD prices might be explained by the extraordi nary fact that more than 95 per cent of all music CDs in the western world are distributed by just six big companies: BMG, Polygram, Universal, Warner, EMI and Sony. </p> <p>Not so, claims a huffy letter from BMG. 'You assert that six companies dominate the industry. [Due to] takeovers, there is (sic) currently five, and will soon be four when Warner and EMI merge.' </p> <p>The industry spokesman avers that my error should convince readers that there is no monopoly control of the market. </p> <p>I stand corrected. </p> <p> <strong> The Generous-To-A-Fault Award to... Ford Motor.</strong> </p> <p> As British citizens, you have a right to compensation from cartels that conspire to fix prices. But as British subjects, no consumer in the past hundred or so years has actually collected anything in a court of law from rip-off monopolists. </p> <p>Previously, I spotlighted the case of John Clare. I tried to get him back some loot from Volvo UK (a unit of American car maker Ford Motor). Despite a finding by the Office of Fair Trading that Clare's dealer participated in a price-fixing ring, he got nothing. Anti-trust experts say the presence of a manufacturer-aided price-fixing conspiracy would bend the whole market. Volvo did create a voluntary compensation fund, but when we first checked, of the 100,000 consumers who purchased a Volvo during the three-year period of collusive pricing, none had received compensation. </p> <p>Volvo told us that this is an indication that virtually all its customers believed they had paid a fair price. My own view is that this may have been the result of a minor oversight in the refund programme: Volvo didn't notify any of its customers. </p> <p>I can now report that Clare has received the handsome sum of \u00a3720 from his Volvo dealer and several lucky buyers have received \u00a325 M&amp;S gift vouchers. Thanks, guys. That only leaves, by my estimate, roughly 99,000 refund claims to go. </p> <p> <strong> The Last-Straw-Gilded-Cage Award goes to... Wackenhut Corporation.</strong> </p> <p> One year ago this week, we ran a story about Wackenhut Corrections, the operator of a private prison in New Mexico where sadism, greed and frightening incompetence risked lives and the public purse. </p> <p>Internal company documents and witnesses revealed, for example, that a chief guard warned company executives that their penny-pinching under-staffing was, 'a death sentence' for guards sent alone into cell blocks. A company executive responded: 'Better to lose one guard than two.' Two weeks after this glib comment, the prediction became reality: a lone guard was murdered along with a prisoner in a riot. </p> <p>Over the past months, Wackenhut has run into more trouble. The US Justice Department charged the company with using 'excessive force and gas grenades' in a youth detention centre in Louisiana, where guards beat a 17-year-old boy so severely that part of his intestines leaked into his colostomy bag. </p> <p>Then the state of Texas indicted 20 Wackenhut guards and officials on criminal charges of sexually abusing prisoners. Wackenhut's stock has tanked. </p> <p>Say what you like about Jack Straw, but in this case, the Home Secretary has shown us his soft-hearted side, granting the beleaguered Wackenhut political asylum in the UK. The Home Office handed the refugee company contracts to run the immigrant and asylum-seekers' detention centre in Manchester, and granted Wackenhut new contracts to operate prisons in Doncaster and Marchington. On the news that the Home Office also approved Wackenhut's opening a youth detention centre in Bristol, New Mexico's prison watchdog, state Senator Cisco McSorley, told The Observer : 'That's bordering on the bizarre.' </p> <p> <strong> And finally, The Dammed-If-You-Do Award to... Balfour Beatty.</strong> </p> <p> In July, Inside corporate America published comments by one of Britain's top corporate lawyers. He told us that, in 1997, at a Department of Trade reception, a man identified as chairman of construction company Balfour Beatty 'announced with enormous pride that he personally had handed over the cheque to the government minister for the Pergau dam bribe' in Malaysia. </p> <p>Not unexpectedly, that week's mail brought a note from Balfour Beatty. Spokesman Tim Sharp wrote that he had spoken to The Observer's source, who 'denies absolutely having said what is attributed to him'. The company demanded a retraction. </p> <p>There was something odd about this complaint. The company seemed to challenge only the wording of the allegation, not the substance. For clarification I wrote to the company asking for an answer to a simple, and far more relevant question: 'Did Balfour Beatty pay bribes in Malaysia - yes or no?' We received no reply. </p> <p>This is a difficult time for Balfour Beatty. A consortium to which the company belongs faces new charges of bribery, this time over another dam project in Lesotho in southern Africa.. I thought the company deserved an extra chance to clear its name. So I called Sharp. </p> <p> Obs: Was a payment made to a government official by Balfour Beatty, its chairman or an agent for its chairman regarding the Pergau Dam project, yes or no? </p> <p>BB: I tell you I've worked with some journalists in my time! </p> <p> Obs: Did you pay a bribe? </p> <p>BB: I like your approach. </p> <p> Obs: I just want to know if you bribed the Malaysians. </p> <p>BB: We could spend the rest of the afternoon... </p> <p>We nearly did. This continued for almost an hour. </p> <p> Obs: I'm worried about the issue of bribery and corruption. </p> <p>BB: Aren't we all? </p> <p> Obs: I'm happy to print 'Balfour Beatty states unequivocally that no payment was made to a Malaysian official.' </p> <p>BB: I suggested to you that you might have misled people. </p> <p>How had The Observer led our readers astray? </p> <p>BB: The thing you wrote has been denied flatly by your alleged source. </p> <p>Indeed, the company had received a letter from the lawyer this paper had quoted. I asked Sharp to read it twice during our interview. Only on the second reading did he include this: </p> <p>BB: [from the letter]'I do not deny the accuracy of the words attributed to me in the article.' </p> <p>Oh. Well, in that case, along with the company's Golden Vulture Award, which has been deposited in a numbered Swiss account, Inside corporate America offers the following correction: 'We hereby retract the statements made regarding Balfour Beatty's alleged boasting of corrupt practices on the grounds that our article was wholly accurate.' </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gregory.palast@theguardian.com\">gregory.palast@theguardian.com</a></p>",

However, the recording industry seeks ruinous damages against Napster on grounds that the website's technology knowingly abets copyright infringement. Forget Napster, Sony. You now face an even bigger threat of music filching. One company has just begun to market a device just like a Walkman which the manufacturer openly advertises as making it 'easy to record music off the internet'. The music-snatching machine is made by, uh, Sony. Sony should sue. The Four's-A-Crowd Award to ... Sony Corporation. It could be that the world's skint youth pilfers music off Napster because of the stratospheric prices of CDs in stores. This column suggested (and Italian and US trustbusters agree) that suspiciously high CD prices might be explained by the extraordi nary fact that more than 95 per cent of all music CDs in the western world are distributed by just six big companies: BMG, Polygram, Universal, Warner, EMI and Sony. Not so, claims a huffy letter from BMG. 'You assert that six companies dominate the industry. [Due to] takeovers, there is (sic) currently five, and will soon be four when Warner and EMI merge.' The industry spokesman avers that my error should convince readers that there is no monopoly control of the market. I stand corrected. The Generous-To-A-Fault Award to... Ford Motor. As British citizens, you have a right to compensation from cartels that conspire to fix prices. But as British subjects, no consumer in the past hundred or so years has actually collected anything in a court of law from rip-off monopolists. Previously, I spotlighted the case of John Clare. I tried to get him back some loot from Volvo UK (a unit of American car maker Ford Motor). Despite a finding by the Office of Fair Trading that Clare's dealer participated in a price-fixing ring, he got nothing. Anti-trust experts say the presence of a manufacturer-aided price-fixing conspiracy would bend the whole market. Volvo did create a voluntary compensation fund, but when we first checked, of the 100,000 consumers who purchased a Volvo during the three-year period of collusive pricing, none had received compensation. Volvo told us that this is an indication that virtually all its customers believed they had paid a fair price. My own view is that this may have been the result of a minor oversight in the refund programme: Volvo didn't notify any of its customers. I can now report that Clare has received the handsome sum of \u00a3720 from his Volvo dealer and several lucky buyers have received \u00a325 M&amp;S gift vouchers. Thanks, guys. That only leaves, by my estimate, roughly 99,000 refund claims to go. The Last-Straw-Gilded-Cage Award goes to... Wackenhut Corporation. One year ago this week, we ran a story about Wackenhut Corrections, the operator of a private prison in New Mexico where sadism, greed and frightening incompetence risked lives and the public purse. Internal company documents and witnesses revealed, for example, that a chief guard warned company executives that their penny-pinching under-staffing was, 'a death sentence' for guards sent alone into cell blocks. A company executive responded: 'Better to lose one guard than two.' Two weeks after this glib comment, the prediction became reality: a lone guard was murdered along with a prisoner in a riot. Over the past months, Wackenhut has run into more trouble. The US Justice Department charged the company with using 'excessive force and gas grenades' in a youth detention centre in Louisiana, where guards beat a 17-year-old boy so severely that part of his intestines leaked into his colostomy bag. Then the state of Texas indicted 20 Wackenhut guards and officials on criminal charges of sexually abusing prisoners. Wackenhut's stock has tanked. Say what you like about Jack Straw, but in this case, the Home Secretary has shown us his soft-hearted side, granting the beleaguered Wackenhut political asylum in the UK. The Home Office handed the refugee company contracts to run the immigrant and asylum-seekers' detention centre in Manchester, and granted Wackenhut new contracts to operate prisons in Doncaster and Marchington. On the news that the Home Office also approved Wackenhut's opening a youth detention centre in Bristol, New Mexico's prison watchdog, state Senator Cisco McSorley, told The Observer : 'That's bordering on the bizarre.' And finally, The Dammed-If-You-Do Award to... Balfour Beatty. In July, Inside corporate America published comments by one of Britain's top corporate lawyers. He told us that, in 1997, at a Department of Trade reception, a man identified as chairman of construction company Balfour Beatty 'announced with enormous pride that he personally had handed over the cheque to the government minister for the Pergau dam bribe' in Malaysia. Not unexpectedly, that week's mail brought a note from Balfour Beatty. Spokesman Tim Sharp wrote that he had spoken to The Observer's source, who 'denies absolutely having said what is attributed to him'. The company demanded a retraction. There was something odd about this complaint. The company seemed to challenge only the wording of the allegation, not the substance. For clarification I wrote to the company asking for an answer to a simple, and far more relevant question: 'Did Balfour Beatty pay bribes in Malaysia - yes or no?' We received no reply. This is a difficult time for Balfour Beatty. A consortium to which the company belongs faces new charges of bribery, this time over another dam project in Lesotho in southern Africa.. I thought the company deserved an extra chance to clear its name. So I called Sharp. Obs: Was a payment made to a government official by Balfour Beatty, its chairman or an agent for its chairman regarding the Pergau Dam project, yes or no? BB: I tell you I've worked with some journalists in my time! Obs: Did you pay a bribe? BB: I like your approach. Obs: I just want to know if you bribed the Malaysians. BB: We could spend the rest of the afternoon... We nearly did. This continued for almost an hour. Obs: I'm worried about the issue of bribery and corruption. BB: Aren't we all? Obs: I'm happy to print 'Balfour Beatty states unequivocally that no payment was made to a Malaysian official.' BB: I suggested to you that you might have misled people. How had The Observer led our readers astray? BB: The thing you wrote has been denied flatly by your alleged source. Indeed, the company had received a letter from the lawyer this paper had quoted. I asked Sharp to read it twice during our interview. Only on the second reading did he include this: BB: [from the letter]'I do not deny the accuracy of the words attributed to me in the article.' Oh. Well, in that case, along with the company's Golden Vulture Award, which has been deposited in a numbered Swiss account, Inside corporate America offers the following correction: 'We hereby retract the statements made regarding Balfour Beatty's alleged boasting of corrupt practices on the grounds that our article was wholly accurate.' gregory.palast@theguardian.com",

This isn't, I suspect, a result of DNA as much as it is a series of Pavlovan (sic) reflexes - that's pavlova as in the fine Aussie dessert of meringue topped with fruit and whipped cream. The snapshot memories of a year spent in Australia at the age of three are my earliest: ancient, sunburnt, dusty-red earth; the bogey-cum-swagman whom I imagined lurked, waiting to grab a stray ankle, at the bottom of cattle grids; the rich lanolin stink of a freshly-sheared sheep; the sharp, heady tang of a scrunched-up dried gum leaf...

Only an Aussie ever picks it up, but it's there. </p> <p>I tell you this only so that you know how excited I was by the prospect of the first episode of Robert Hughes's portrait of Australia, <strong>Beyond the Fatal Shore</strong>. Partly because if anybody can turn 2-D TV into a scratch-and-sniff experience it is Hughes, but also because I would get the chance to ogle my home-from-home like a sad voyeur sat at the window with night-sight binoculars, waiting for people 12,000 miles across the road to provide me with a cheap vicarious thrill. To this end, with any luck, I'd get some top-quality sunset action, a bit of sexy surf, a few sensual, swooping airborne shots of the world's most beautiful modern city (that's Sydney for the record, not Canberra) and, well, blow me down, there's voyeurism - and then there's... isn't that a buck-naked Bruce having his flaccid manhood fluffed by a bodice-ripped, bare-breasted Sheila? </p> <p>Given his survival of a near-fatal car crash, near Broome (which is not a place a man would want to die but a place where, without ever being involved in a crash, he may feel that he might), Hughes's journey was always going to be idiosyncratic. Suddenly chased by the spectre of his own mortality and declaring that his 'need to know Australia was stronger' as a result, Beyond the Fatal Shore evolved into a trip inside Hughes's head, providing glimpses of the Greatest Living Australian's own Dreamtime.

      "body": "<p>'Don't laugh,' said a veteran industry observer last week as he reflected on the latest vicissitudes of one of Britain's most famous and venerable 'old-economy' concerns. 'This company is like what a successful dotcom will be in five to 10 years.' </p> <p>The company's name? Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine, marine and energy engineering group. </p> <p>Is this an absurd attempt to attract attention to a once-mighty British national champion in an ignored and undervalued sector? No, maintains the analyst, Sandy Morris of ABN Amro. Rolls-Royce may have been as good as giving away its main product [the Trent aero engine], but it has created a high-value product and has a guaranteed subscriber base in future. 'It now has nearly 60,000 engines out there, which will be needing maintenance and repairs. And this is a subscriber base that won't churn.' </p> <p>Maybe. But a less flattering comparison with dotcoms is Rolls's ability to burn cash in the scramble for market share. Rolls has poured money into developing and discounting its Trent engines to grab 35 per cent of the civil aircraft engine market and lucrative maintenance work down the line. </p> <p>So, despite being profitable, cashflow has been gobbled up by development costs. And the shares have been uninspiring - Rolls has underperformed the market by 50 per cent in the last five years. </p> <p>Another similarity with dotcoms is the difficulty management has had in explaining the logic behind the company, and its propensity for springing nasty surprises. Last month Rolls shed 22 per cent off its shares - seeing them slump to below their 1987 privatisation price of \u00a31.70 - after chairman Sir Ralph Robins and chief executive John Rose issued a profits warning and abandoned their aspiration to deliver double-digit earnings growth. </p> <p>The Rolls announcement was bungled. The Financial Times's influential Lex column remarked: 'There is no reason why Rolls-Royce should do such an awful job of telling investors what is going on.' </p> <p>Rolls' management was also in the firing line last year when it unveiled a lightning deal to buy the marine and defence group Vickers for \u00a3576 million - a 53 per cent premium. Analysts didn't like the surprise, nor did they immediately take to the assets Rolls acquired - an ill-fitting defence business and a marine propulsion operation. </p> <p>Rolls chief executive John Rose sees it differently. He could not spread the news earlier because Rolls was in its closed period, and it only became aware of all the problems in early August.Asked whether targeting double-digit growth was making a rod for the company's back, he admitted: 'Yes, but we all have PhDs in hindsight. It was important to show we believed we could still increase profits with a heavy R&amp;D programme.' Profits he insist, will grow again from 2002. </p> <p>The uncharitable old hands of British industry will mutter that this is yet another example of problems going back decades. Roll-Royce, a beloved name in Britain's industrial pantheon, has disappointed investors and Ministers for decades. Its nadir came in 1971, when it had to be bailed out by the Heath government. The reason is haunting for investors in modern Rolls. The company - which then included the auto manufacturer - spent fortunes developing the Trent's predecessor, the RB211 aero engine, to win business from US competitors General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney on aircraft made by Boeing and the then fledgling Airbus. </p> <p>Rolls was investigated by the Government's Industrial Organisation Committee, which expressed concern about the RB211 development draining cash, and Rolls' preference for engineering over financial control. </p> <p>Warnings were loftily ignored. The Heath government gave \u00a342m to the RB211 programme. This was not enough, and receivers were called in in February 1971. The Government was forced to nationalise it - floating off the car manufacturer shortly afterwards. </p> <p>In state hands throughout the Seventies, Rolls concentrated on developing the RB211 to compete for market share, and flirted with alliances with GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney. </p> <p>After privatisation in 1987, Rolls won business from Airbus and Boeing, most recently in last week's important order by the giant International Lease Finance Corporation for the Airbus A3XX superjumbo, on which ILFC has specified Trent engines. </p> <p>But that good news has not stopped City disquiet. Double-digit growth was undermined in part because of the unexpected end of service for around 100 Tri Star and other aircraft which are powered by the RB211 - taking a nasty chunk out of the high-margin repair and maintenance work upon which profitability and cashflow is largely dependent. </p> <p>Alongside this came problems with the industrial variant of Trent, used to produce energy, which fell foul of emissions standards. </p> <p>Experts believe the problems for Rolls are bound up with the business model. Cut-throat competition between the three big players means that if engines are not given away free - as GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney have claimed about former Rolls deals with buyers such as Singapore Airlines - then they have been deeply discounted by up to 80 per cent of the estimated $10m price. With a development cost of around $2 billion for Trent, plus other R&amp;D spending throughout the group, this does violence to the balance sheet. Morris says: 'There is huge investment up front. The problem for Rolls as opposed to, say, a telecoms company is that the paybacks in aerospace are so long-term - up to 30 years.' </p> <p>This is all very well if the second part of the Rolls business model works: reaping the 60 per cent plus margins from maintenance work. But at best this is 10 years away. At worst planes can be retired early - as were the Tristars - or development costs for future projects can cancel out the benefits from repair work. </p> <p>But Rose insists the future is brighter.

      "bodyText": "'Don't laugh,' said a veteran industry observer last week as he reflected on the latest vicissitudes of one of Britain's most famous and venerable 'old-economy' concerns. 'This company is like what a successful dotcom will be in five to 10 years.' The company's name? Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine, marine and energy engineering group. Is this an absurd attempt to attract attention to a once-mighty British national champion in an ignored and undervalued sector? No, maintains the analyst, Sandy Morris of ABN Amro. Rolls-Royce may have been as good as giving away its main product [the Trent aero engine], but it has created a high-value product and has a guaranteed subscriber base in future. 'It now has nearly 60,000 engines out there, which will be needing maintenance and repairs. And this is a subscriber base that won't churn.' Maybe. But a less flattering comparison with dotcoms is Rolls's ability to burn cash in the scramble for market share. Rolls has poured money into developing and discounting its Trent engines to grab 35 per cent of the civil aircraft engine market and lucrative maintenance work down the line. So, despite being profitable, cashflow has been gobbled up by development costs. And the shares have been uninspiring - Rolls has underperformed the market by 50 per cent in the last five years. Another similarity with dotcoms is the difficulty management has had in explaining the logic behind the company, and its propensity for springing nasty surprises. Last month Rolls shed 22 per cent off its shares - seeing them slump to below their 1987 privatisation price of \u00a31.70 - after chairman Sir Ralph Robins and chief executive John Rose issued a profits warning and abandoned their aspiration to deliver double-digit earnings growth. The Rolls announcement was bungled. The Financial Times's influential Lex column remarked: 'There is no reason why Rolls-Royce should do such an awful job of telling investors what is going on.' Rolls' management was also in the firing line last year when it unveiled a lightning deal to buy the marine and defence group Vickers for \u00a3576 million - a 53 per cent premium. Analysts didn't like the surprise, nor did they immediately take to the assets Rolls acquired - an ill-fitting defence business and a marine propulsion operation. Rolls chief executive John Rose sees it differently. He could not spread the news earlier because Rolls was in its closed period, and it only became aware of all the problems in early August.Asked whether targeting double-digit growth was making a rod for the company's back, he admitted: 'Yes, but we all have PhDs in hindsight. It was important to show we believed we could still increase profits with a heavy R&amp;D programme.' Profits he insist, will grow again from 2002. The uncharitable old hands of British industry will mutter that this is yet another example of problems going back decades. Roll-Royce, a beloved name in Britain's industrial pantheon, has disappointed investors and Ministers for decades. Its nadir came in 1971, when it had to be bailed out by the Heath government. The reason is haunting for investors in modern Rolls. The company - which then included the auto manufacturer - spent fortunes developing the Trent's predecessor, the RB211 aero engine, to win business from US competitors General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney on aircraft made by Boeing and the then fledgling Airbus. Rolls was investigated by the Government's Industrial Organisation Committee, which expressed concern about the RB211 development draining cash, and Rolls' preference for engineering over financial control. Warnings were loftily ignored. The Heath government gave \u00a342m to the RB211 programme. This was not enough, and receivers were called in in February 1971. The Government was forced to nationalise it - floating off the car manufacturer shortly afterwards. In state hands throughout the Seventies, Rolls concentrated on developing the RB211 to compete for market share, and flirted with alliances with GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney. After privatisation in 1987, Rolls won business from Airbus and Boeing, most recently in last week's important order by the giant International Lease Finance Corporation for the Airbus A3XX superjumbo, on which ILFC has specified Trent engines. But that good news has not stopped City disquiet. Double-digit growth was undermined in part because of the unexpected end of service for around 100 Tri Star and other aircraft which are powered by the RB211 - taking a nasty chunk out of the high-margin repair and maintenance work upon which profitability and cashflow is largely dependent. Alongside this came problems with the industrial variant of Trent, used to produce energy, which fell foul of emissions standards. Experts believe the problems for Rolls are bound up with the business model. Cut-throat competition between the three big players means that if engines are not given away free - as GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney have claimed about former Rolls deals with buyers such as Singapore Airlines - then they have been deeply discounted by up to 80 per cent of the estimated $10m price. With a development cost of around $2 billion for Trent, plus other R&amp;D spending throughout the group, this does violence to the balance sheet. Morris says: 'There is huge investment up front. The problem for Rolls as opposed to, say, a telecoms company is that the paybacks in aerospace are so long-term - up to 30 years.' This is all very well if the second part of the Rolls business model works: reaping the 60 per cent plus margins from maintenance work. But at best this is 10 years away. At worst planes can be retired early - as were the Tristars - or development costs for future projects can cancel out the benefits from repair work. But Rose insists the future is brighter. The average age of planes with R-R engines is getting younger - from nine years to 8.5 years, with a 2005 target of eight years - meaning more maintenance work before planes are taken out of service. Rolls'US competitors, particularly Jack Welsh's GE, have acted to break this cycle by offering leasing packages to airlines, which spreads purchase and maintenance costs in payments over the life of the engine. Rolls has tried to deal with these problems by spreading the risk and investment on development with partners, and it now has a complicated and obscure web of relationships, which it claims brought in \u00a3156m in the first half of this year. Bigger questions exist over Rolls' partnership options. Some observers can see the sense in the Vickers deal as the specialist shipping market is due to grow by 8 to 12 per cent.Vickers gives Rolls the ability to go to shipping operators and offer complete propulsion systems rather than simply engines. But a question hangs over what it will do with the Vickers defence business, whose value lies in its order book.

Sandy Morris concludes: 'The thing is that everyone wants this bloody thing to succeed so much and they get so frustrated when things don't go just right.'

He'd been told to come up with a dozen back labels by lunchtime, and he was struggling like a man wading through porridge. Once upon a time, being a winemaker began and ended with the stuff in the bottle; nowadays you have to be a copywriter too.</p> <p>Not a very good one, mind you. Most back labels are virtually interchangeable; wit and insight are rare. Believe me, reading a few hundred examples is mind-bendingly tedious. You long for a little honesty, a tasting note couched in the style of Roy Brooks, the estate agent who developed a reputation for telling the truth. 'This vintage was a total bummer. It never stopped raining, the grapes were in terrible condition and our assistant winemaker consumed industrial quantities of Prozac. But, what do you know, we still managed to make something drinkable. Enjoy!'</p> <p>To keep my spirits up, I concocted a composite back label, suitable for any New World red. 'The grapes for this hand-crafted (fill in variety) were harvested before dawn from sun-kissed vineyards in the foothills of the world-famous (fill in location) region, where a combination of warm days, cool nights and free-draining soils produces wines with rare finesse. This truly outstanding wine is the result of skilful winemaking. It is rich and complex with velvety tannins and a luscious vanilla undertone from ageing in prime French oak. Ideal with meat, pasta, pizza, cheese, curries, fish and vegetarian dishes, it is also enjoyable before or after a meal. Stored horizontally, this wine will age indefinitely. Phil Blanks (BSc, Oenology).'</p> <p>Who is to blame for all this verbiage? Sometimes it's the winemaker himself, anxious to share every detail of what he gets up to in the cellar; but, more often, it's the winery owner or his cynical marketing department. The conviction out there is that the more information you give the consumer - however bland, erroneous or sanitised - the more likely he (or more commonly she) is to buy your product. This is particularly true of New World back labels, many of which are pointless: one part chemistry lab to two parts holiday brochure.</p> <p>Back labels can serve a useful purpose, giving us details of grape varieties and region of origin as well as some idea of what to expect when we pull the cork. But I agree with Helen McGinn of Tesco when she says, 'We don't need a description of the grower's left armpit to find out what a wine tastes like.' Come to think of it, I don't think we need food and wine recommendations either. Why not let the customer decide? I'm a great fan of the back label I saw in California on a bottle from Sean Thackeray last year. 'This red wine,' it pointed out with a seemingly straight face, 'goes well with the sorts of things red wines go well with.'</p> <p>This is my second favourite back label of all time. My favourite, written by the Polish-American painter 'Big' Frank Chludinski for his Vin de Pays Deep Pink Ros\u00e9 (\u00a33.99, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up, Victoria Wine) goes as follows: 'I'm fed up with writing the normal pile of rubbish.

      "bodyText": "'Oh, man, what do I write this time?' I can still remember the winemaker's anguished expression as he looked up from his desk. He'd been told to come up with a dozen back labels by lunchtime, and he was struggling like a man wading through porridge. Once upon a time, being a winemaker began and ended with the stuff in the bottle; nowadays you have to be a copywriter too. Not a very good one, mind you. Most back labels are virtually interchangeable; wit and insight are rare. Believe me, reading a few hundred examples is mind-bendingly tedious. You long for a little honesty, a tasting note couched in the style of Roy Brooks, the estate agent who developed a reputation for telling the truth. 'This vintage was a total bummer. It never stopped raining, the grapes were in terrible condition and our assistant winemaker consumed industrial quantities of Prozac. But, what do you know, we still managed to make something drinkable. Enjoy!' To keep my spirits up, I concocted a composite back label, suitable for any New World red. 'The grapes for this hand-crafted (fill in variety) were harvested before dawn from sun-kissed vineyards in the foothills of the world-famous (fill in location) region, where a combination of warm days, cool nights and free-draining soils produces wines with rare finesse. This truly outstanding wine is the result of skilful winemaking. It is rich and complex with velvety tannins and a luscious vanilla undertone from ageing in prime French oak. Ideal with meat, pasta, pizza, cheese, curries, fish and vegetarian dishes, it is also enjoyable before or after a meal. Stored horizontally, this wine will age indefinitely. Phil Blanks (BSc, Oenology).' Who is to blame for all this verbiage? Sometimes it's the winemaker himself, anxious to share every detail of what he gets up to in the cellar; but, more often, it's the winery owner or his cynical marketing department. The conviction out there is that the more information you give the consumer - however bland, erroneous or sanitised - the more likely he (or more commonly she) is to buy your product. This is particularly true of New World back labels, many of which are pointless: one part chemistry lab to two parts holiday brochure. Back labels can serve a useful purpose, giving us details of grape varieties and region of origin as well as some idea of what to expect when we pull the cork. But I agree with Helen McGinn of Tesco when she says, 'We don't need a description of the grower's left armpit to find out what a wine tastes like.' Come to think of it, I don't think we need food and wine recommendations either. Why not let the customer decide? I'm a great fan of the back label I saw in California on a bottle from Sean Thackeray last year. 'This red wine,' it pointed out with a seemingly straight face, 'goes well with the sorts of things red wines go well with.' This is my second favourite back label of all time. My favourite, written by the Polish-American painter 'Big' Frank Chludinski for his Vin de Pays Deep Pink Ros\u00e9 (\u00a33.99, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up, Victoria Wine) goes as follows: 'I'm fed up with writing the normal pile of rubbish. Yes, we picked it when the grapes were ripe. Yes, we fermented it at low temperatures. Yes, it's great with fish, barbecues and red meats. My wife likes it with chocolate mousse_ but that's her problem. I'm afraid the only way to decide if you like my Deep Pink is to buy a bottle, take it home, pull out the cork and drink it.' I don't know about you, but this is one piece of advice that I'm more than happy to follow. Best cellars 1999 Firefinch Sauvignon Blanc (\u00a33.99, Tesco). I'm not sure how the eccentric Abrie Bruwer manages to produce Sauvignon this good in the heat of the Cape, but this full-flavoured, gooseberry-and-green-bean style white is great value at under \u00a34. 1999 Terra Mater Estates Sauvignon Blanc, Select Cuv\u00e9e, Casablanca Valley (\u00a35.99, Safeway). Chilean Sauvignon Blanc is not always the genuine article - it is frequently inferior Sauvignonasse - but this honeyed, weighty, tropical, fruity example shows how well the grape can perform in the Casablanca Valley. 1999 Pouilly-Fum\u00e9 Chatelain (\u00a38.49, Waitrose). A modern, stainless-steel fermented Loire Sauvignon Blanc showing the smoky, minerally aromas and taut, grassy, knife-edge flavours that are so typical of Pouilly-Fum\u00e9. Textbook stuff. 1999 Villa Maria Reserve Sauvignon Blanc, Wairau Valley (\u00a39.99, Wine Rack; Bottoms Up; Safeway; Unwins; selected branches of Victoria Wine; Tesco). One of a number of excellent Sauvignons produced by the winemakers at Villa Maria in the Wairu Valley region, this is among New Zealand's best whites. Classic gooseberry and grapefruit characters are underpinned both by its zesty acidity and its stony complexity.",

Speaking to my stomach, she said, 'I'll take you out to your favourite restaurant if you do it, and if you don't, then you have to take me.' </p> <p> So I started the next Monday morning.

I sent it to 10 agents and got nine rejection letters.

Clearly it still needed some work. He added a little chilli to enhance the natural heat of the ginger, and some extract of yarrow, juniper and speedwell. 'It's the brewer's yeast, capsicum and lemon that give it the full-bodied flavour,' says Robson, 'along with the powdery ginger sediment you find in the bottle.' He then made it more stable by pasteurisation, and reduced the alcohol content so it could be sold as a soft drink. Now, it seems, the deliciously intense taste of Fentimans is fast becoming a must-have mixer in London's cocktail bars. You may find yourself sipping it in a Pimm's cocktail or a Dark and Stormy, with some rum and lime. Not quite what the Victorians intended, but who cares when it tastes so good.",

      "body": "<p>When it comes to the pursuit of a healthier lifestyle, there are, apparently, many ways in which we can have our cake and eat it. The proliferation of products that come with a 'low' prefix means that low-fat foods, low-tar cigarettes and low-alcohol drinks are all out there to be consumed with impunity - or so we believe. Yet one of these products has just been banned and others may not be as beneficial as you think.</p> <p><b> Cigarettes</b></p> <p>By 2003, you will no longer be able to smoke a Marlboro Light, Silk Cut Ultra Low or any other low-tar cigarette in the UK. The European Commission has banned these terms from being used, seeing them as misleading, given that the reduction in health risks that 'low-tar' cigarettes offer over their counterparts is negligible. 'The fact is, many consumers don't realise this is a con,' says Clive Bates, director of ASH (Action on Smoking and Health).</p> <p>Low-tar cigarettes do not use different ingredients from high tar - there's no such thing as tar-free tobacco, for example. Instead, the tar level is lowered using filters inserted into the cigarette's end which trap tar as the smoke is drawn through. Very low-tar products further ventilate the filter with tiny holes that dilute the smoke even more. So, while a normal Benson &amp; Hedges cigarette yields 12mg of tar in laboratory tests (where a machine smokes the cigarette and measures the tar produced), a low-tar cigarette yields just 1mg - dramatically reducing its potentially carcinogenic effects. 'The trouble is that people aren't machines in laboratories,' says Dr Martin Jarvis from the Imperial Cancer Research Campaign. 'People smoke cigarettes to get nicotine, and this is cut along with the tar in a filtered cigarette. Therefore, to ensure that they still get the level their body \"needs\", smokers change the way they smoke low-tar brands.'</p> <p>How they do this varies, and is often determined by the brand they smoke. Those smoking 'light' cigarettes (which rely primarily on the filter action alone) tend to take more puffs per cigarette than average, or inhale more deeply, thereby increasing the amount of nicotine that gets through the filter intact. With ultra-low brands that use ventilation filters, smokers physically block the holes with their fingers or lips - in one trial, 76 per cent of cigarettes showed evidence of this. The end result is that the smokers take in far more tar than the companies calculate. In fact, in a previous test carried out by The Observer together with ASH in 1998, the average yield from a low-tar cigarette (a Silk Cut Ultra) smoked with the filter holes blocked, was 12mg of tar - exactly the same as a Benson &amp; Hedges Special Filter.</p> <p>'The result is that you're just as likely to die from smoking a low-tar cigarette as a normal one,' says Clive Bates. 'Which is bad news for all those people who decided that instead of quitting smoking, they'd switch to a low-tar brand. And we know there are thousands of them out there.'</p> <p><b> Alcohol</b></p> <p>Since his recent Priory visit, Ronnie Wood has reportedly been spotted nursing a bottle of Kaliber, which, according to Dr Abdulla Badawa, consultant clinical biochemist at Cardiff's Whitchurch Hospital, is no bad thing. 'Alcohol-free and low-alcohol drinks are certainly better for you than alcoholic drinks,' he says. 'Alcohol is toxic for our body. Even the slightly protective effect it gives our heart is cancelled out by the negative benefits it produces in the rest of the body. Therefore, anything you can do to reduce someone's alcohol intake is a good thing - and these products do that.'</p> <p>In general, alcohol-free beer contains less than 0.05 per cent alcohol per volume. This means a pint doesn't even register on the scale of 'healthy units' - and explains why Ronnie isn't breaking any rehab rules. Low-alcohol beers do contain alcohol - between 0.5 and 1.2 per cent per serving. However, normal beer ranges from 3 to 11 per cent, so to reach alcohol levels even close to two pints of beer, you'd have to consume 10 standard-sized cans of 1.2 per cent low-alcohol beer. So far so good. Low-alcohol wines are slightly different, however. To earn the title, a wine only has to be at the lower end of the alcohol limit for wine - normally around 12 per cent. While products such as brand leader Eisberg are technically alcohol free (ie, levels are so low as to be negligible), according to Alcohol Concern other 'low-alcohol' wines can be as much as 5 per cent, which equates to just under 1 unit per average pub measure. Three or four could therefore see you getting close to the legal limit before driving.</p> <p>Problems also occur if you switch to low-alcohol drinks after drinking regular alcohol. Studies by Dr Badawa and his team at Cardiff found that men who'd consumed enough alcohol to leave them just under the legal limit for driving (normally two to three pints of beer) went over that limit after just half a pint of 1.2 per cent low-alcohol lager consumed on top. 'It's a mistake to think that switching to low-alcohol lager when you are near your alcohol limit for driving is a reliable way to stay within the law,' Badawa says. And the danger is even greater for women, who don't metabolise alcohol as well. Badawa therefore recommends that drivers stick purely to low-alcohol drinks - or switch to soft drinks after one or two alcoholic ones. His choice would be orange juice, as the natural sugar increases the speed at which you metabolise the alcohol drunk so far. The orange-juice switch will also prevent you having to experience the real problem that comes with low-alcohol drinks: the taste. According to one recent Mintel survey, 42 per cent of people won't drink low-alcohol drinks because they taste foul - or at least nothing like the product they are meant to be replacing.</p> <p><b> Food</b></p> <p>Of course, neither low-tar cigarettes nor low-alcohol drinks are the real success stories of the 'low' industry. This prize goes to low-fat foods, which occupy increasing amounts of supermarket shelf. But, warns Dr Susan Jebb from the Medical Research Council Food and Nutrition Unit in Cambridge, 'lowered-fat foods are only a healthier option if they are used in an intelligent and informed way. The trouble is that manipulation by the food industry and our own attitudes mean this is not normally the case.'</p> <p>A big problem is that the different ways of labelling low-fat foods can mean widely different things, and some labels can hide foods containing high levels of fat and large amounts of calories. By law, 'virtually fat-free' foods can contain no more than 0.15g of fat per 100g of food. 'Low-fat foods' can contain no more than 3g of fat per 100g of food, and if you stuck only to products labelled in this way, your low-fat eating plan would be healthy. However, more tempting products - such as biscuits, crisps and curries - come with a totally different set of labels.</p> <p>Foods marked '5 per cent fat' - or similar - just use a different way of telling you how many grams of fat per 100g they have. Obviously the closer to three this is, the closer they are to truly being low fat. Then there's the '85 per cent (or similar) fat-free' school of labelling. It sounds impressive, but all it means is that the other 15 per cent of the food is fat, so it boasts 15g of fat per 100g of food. A 500g '85 per cent fat-free' ready meal would therefore contain more than a woman's entire day's fat allowance of 70g. Similarly, 'reduced'-fat foods - generally used as a label on higher-fat foods such as crisps and cakes - are foods that legally have to contain at least 25 per cent less fat than the standard version of that food - but that doesn't mean that a high-fat food has become low fat and a healthy option. A chocolate bar is still, relatively speaking, a high-fat product even when its fat content has been reduced.</p> <p>Susan Jebb also says that because most of us err on the side of optimism about how healthy our diet is, 'we tend to think that making any changes at all will mean huge gains for our health. This isn't the case - swapping to semi-skimmed milk and 85 per cent fat-free digestives will not protect you from heart attack if the rest of your diet is bad.'</p> <p>The final sting in the tail with low-fat food products is that their calorie count is often not dramatically different from that of the product they are replacing. 'When fat is taken out of a food, it's normally replaced with some kind of carbohydrate,' says Sue Dibbs, co-director of the Food Commission. 'This could be some kind of starchy filler, in the case of savoury foods, but in sweet foods it's more likely to be in the form of a sugar - maple syrup is very common - and this boosts the calories removed with the fat.' Studies show that the result is that most people who eat low-fat foods consume exactly the same number of calories as those who don't make the switch - and in the US, it has been shown that they eat even more, consuming say two or three low-fat chocolate bars where they would have had only one 'normal' one.</p> <p>'If you want lowered-fat foods to be healthy, you have to use them correctly,' says Jebb. 'If, every time you were going to eat a high-fat food, you swapped it with the lowest-fat alternative to that food available - and you didn't snack on extra foods because you think that low-fat foods don't count - then you would make significant health gains. It's just that most of us don't do that.'</p> <p>Stephen Langley, president of the Association of Naturopathic Practitioners, feels that 'with all doctored products, a moderate amount of the real thing is better for our bodies than large amounts of the replacement. When a product's been manipulated to make it \"healthier\", there's always some payback for our bodies. You have to look at the products concerned and ask if they outweigh the risks of moderate consumption in the first place. Time and time again, the answer will be no.'</p>",

'If, every time you were going to eat a high-fat food, you swapped it with the lowest-fat alternative to that food available - and you didn't snack on extra foods because you think that low-fat foods don't count - then you would make significant health gains. It's just that most of us don't do that.' Stephen Langley, president of the Association of Naturopathic Practitioners, feels that 'with all doctored products, a moderate amount of the real thing is better for our bodies than large amounts of the replacement. When a product's been manipulated to make it \"healthier\", there's always some payback for our bodies. You have to look at the products concerned and ask if they outweigh the risks of moderate consumption in the first place. Time and time again, the answer will be no.'",

      "byline": "Miranda Sawyer",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Alton Towers, August 2000. At the highest point of Oblivion, just before you make the screaming, vertical 60m plunge into the black hole of the earth, your seat tips forward so that you hang for a few seconds, facing the ground, contemplating the inevitable. It's terrifying. Too much perspective. Then the car drops straight down, there's a flash of light and you hurtle into darkness, a strangely cold, wet darkness... until, just as it feels as though you really will have a heart attack, you level out, shoot round a corner and surface. Premature exhilaration. 'It's all about death, isn't it?' says Gillian Wearing cheerfully, as we collect our souvenir picture. She studies it quizzically. 'Next time,' she says, 'we should try and look nonchalant.' </p> <p>Artists are meant to be odd bods; it's part of their job description. But the recent crop of so-called YBAs (Young British Artists: Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Tracey Emin, et al), while not exactly conventional, have always seemed more approachable, more understandable, less bohemian, isolated and disengaged from reality than the artist stereotype. YBAs get drunk and rowdy. They like pop music and TV. They dress like your mates. They make work that is about everyday life and everyday death (and they don't paint it in oils, which is possibly why they have so much time to socialise). So it's no surprise that when you first meet Gillian Wearing, YBA, BA (Goldsmiths), winner of the 1997 Turner Prize, you think: oh, she's dead normal. Gillian, 36, has a young face and long, straight black hair, and she wears men's trousers and patterned shirts. She drinks hot Ribena; she talks about Big Brother. There's nothing particularly attention-seeking about her (unlike, say, Tracey or Damien): she seems a bit shy, though not unfriendly. </p> <p>We meet at Gillian's home in unsalubrious Borough, south London, a Peabody-type flat that's far too tiny for her and her artist boyfriend Michael Landy. Kitchen, sitting room, bedroom, bathroom, all of tiddly proportions. No evidence of a DIY ethic: the sitting room is a teetering clutter of boxes and videos and magazines; the walls are grubby white. There are no pictures, anywhere, other than a large photograph of a young girl with her writing underneath, pinned to the sitting-room wall. Clearly some of Gillian's work. I have a quick look: 'Oh, it's not finished yet,' says Gillian nervously. 'I feel funny about people seeing work when I haven't quite worked out what to do with it.' </p> <p>From 14 September to 29 October, the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gardens will be host to a Gillian Wearing solo exhibition. Sponsored by The Observer, the show will include older work, such as Dancing in Peckham, Sasha and Mum, 2 into 1 , Homage to the Woman..., plus some new stuff: Drunk, Trauma. None of this may mean anything to you, but you'll have had a taste of Gillian's art, even if you've never been to one of her shows. </p> <p>You know that VW advert that shows a security guard, a harassed mother and others holding up a handwritten sign that says what they're supposedly feeling (the security guard's one says 'Sensitive', the mother's 'Sex Chocolate Sex Chocolate'). Well, that's a, ahem, tribute to one of Gillian's photographic works: 1993's Signs that say what you want them to say and not signs that say what someone else wants you to say.</p> <p>Gillian's sign-holders were real people, strangers that she approached on the street and got to write down what they happened to be feeling at the time. The results were unexpected, and unexpectedly touching. The one that everyone remembers is the young businessman whose sign reads, 'I'm Desperate', although I have a soft spot for the chap who displays, with some pride, 'I've thought about being a gigolo but I'm worried about the health risks'. After another advert - for a computer game - again drew on one of Gillian's pieces ( 2 into 1, where the voice of a mother and her sons are transposed, so that the boys speak the mother's words and vice versa), Gillian made a public protest. 'It did really annoy me,' she says now. 'I was annoyed that the advertisers passed it off as though they'd had this unique idea. It's not like you've taken a scene out of a film that everyone knows. There's no references. It's just theft.' </p> <p>Gillian's work is often funny, always human, humane and democratic. It's easy to understand, too, which is probably why it's appropriated by ad agencies; it draws on real life. In Dancing in Peckham , she dances wildly, without music, in a South London shopping centre. Confess all on video. Don't worry, you will be in disguise. Intrigued? Call Gillian shows people in strange masks (Neil Kinnock, George Bush) telling their secrets.</p> <p>Phaidon have a lovely book of Gillian's work: when I went through it, I thought she'd make a brilliant journalist, or documentary maker. She reveals details of people that mostly remain hidden; she talks to people - down-and-outs, kids - who mostly pass unnoticed. She says she thinks of much of her work as portraiture, but portraits where the subject has some personal voice, 'because it's too easy for a photograph to make people look like something they're not'. That's why the picture of the girl on the sitting-room wall has the girl's own carefully rounded writing underneath it.</p> <p>Gillian hasn't got a studio at the moment, which partially explains the chaos of her flat. And it is chaos. There's no hidden system: when she tries to find a video of the preparation she did for Dancing in Peckham , she spends a good quarter of an hour trying to locate it. 'It is here somewhere,' she murmurs. 'I saw it just before you arrived.' She rummages through boxes. The cat hides behind the sofa. Probably a good time to go through Gillian's history. </p> <p>Gillian Clare Wearing was born on 10 December 1963, in Handsworth, Birmingham, the middle child of three - older sister Jainne-Ann, younger brother Richard. Her dad, Brian, sold televisions; Jean, her mum, was a butcher; the family lived in a three-bedroomed house in Great Barr. ('A city kid. I still am. I'd rather see the countryside in a film; I stay in the car when people go for walks.') Gillian's parents split up when she was in her early teens: she says she can't remember exactly when, because her dad had phases of living elsewhere, 'in other women's houses, I think. It's vague territory.' </p> <p>I ask her which of her parents she thinks she's most like. To my surprise, she's entirely thrown by the question, stares at me, starts swallowing her words: 'I, um, er, I, I, well, I've, um never thought about it.' She's not unhappy about me asking; it's just that she genuinely hasn't a clue how to answer. She calls Michael out of the kitchen, asks him what he thinks. He says he hasn't met her family often enough to tell. After five minutes deliberation, Gillian finally offers, with a laugh: 'Well, my father liked to argue things out. Not have shouting arguments, but argue, meaning discussion.' Gillian herself appears very non-confrontational. But then, perhaps she's hit her post-adolescent mellow period: 'I was put on report on my first day in secondary school. I hit a teacher.' Blimey. Why? 'She hit me.' </p> <p>On the same day, Gillian met Christine Knight. She approached her because 'her shoes were much better than mine' (they were platforms). Christine and Gillian became friends, went to Aston Villa football matches together. Throughout her teens and early twenties, Gillian would have one close girlfriend, maybe two: when she grew apart from Christine, Michelle Markam became Gillian's closest mate. Gillian and Michelle listened to music together, tried out make-up, began to bunk off school. One day, while they were wagging, they bumped into Gillian's dad: 'We were all dolled up: it was our punk phase, we must have been 14. And we saw him. He walked about 10ft away from us, stared straight through us. I never worked out if he'd actually recognised us or not.' </p> <p> School wasn't going too well. Outside school was getting better and better. Punk happened, swiftly followed by ska and rude boy, then new romantic, then Goth. Gillian had a haircut for each. he shows me a picture of the three Wearing children on holiday in Cornwall. Jainne-Ann has a perm and a saucy look; Richard is pulling faces and giving the thumbs up. Gillian is at the back, in her rude-girl phase, hair and face just so, hin up, all bravado and no smiling. About 15 years old. She's barely recognisable. </p> <p>Looks were very important to Gillian, when she was young. She recalls the hours she'd spend on white, pancake make-up, fussing with her unco-oporative hair, drawing lines around her eyes to make them bigger, squeezing into a ridiculous taffeta skirt so tight that 'I could only make fairy steps.' On Saturday nights, she'd go round to Michelle's to go out. But Michelle took even longer than Gillian to get ready. 'By the time we caught the 51 bus and made it all the way into town, it was time to catch the last one back again. Still,' says Gillian, wryly, 'at least everyone on the bus saw what we looked like.' </p> <p>The girls started to go to nightclubs (though 'we never drank. We couldn't afford it'), places like Rumrunner, where pre-fame Duran Duran and Boy George hung out. Sometimes, George would catch the bus with Gillian. She recalls seeing him dance: he had this move where he waggled his hand in front of his face (she demonstrates: it appears that the lovely George was trying to flush himself down the toilet). Gillian thought George's dance was just fantastic. </p> <p>It's simplistic, but you could say that Gillian's teenage years and passions eventually turned themselves inside out and became her work. She herself notes that it wasn't until she went to art school that she gave up putting so much artistry into her own appearance. Up until then, she was her own canvas. Yet, despite her look-at-me outer shell, she was a quiet, shy person, drawn to others, like Boy George, like Christine and Michelle, whom she considered more interesting than herself. Now, such people inform her work: Gillian's art is other people. Now, shy as she is, she will approach someone in the street just because they've 'got something about them'; talk to them, explain she's an artist, ask if they'd mind having their photo taken. What do you look for? 'I dunno. Someone who reminds you of someone in your childhood or of yourself. I dunno what it is, but it's there and sometimes it can click when you see people.' </p> <p>Sometimes, when she lacks the courage to approach someone, she kicks herself for weeks afterwards. One such occasion was when she spotted a woman with a bandaged face on a road in south-east London. The woman was out with friends, going clubbing, enjoying herself, entirely ordinary except for her white swaddling mask. Gillian didn't talk to her, but found her so inspiring that she made a work, Homage to the Woman with the Bandaged Face I Saw Yesterday Down Walworth Road , where she wrapped her own face up in bandages and walked the length of the Walworth Road, filming people's reac tions. She was incredibly nervous - 'I could have bumped into my neighbours' - and had to have a couple of whiskies before she went out. Why did you do it? </p> <p>'She stood out. I'm transfixed by people that I see that do stand out, whether they want to or not. It was seeing what it's like to be able to do that and to have some kind of kinship with it. Cos I'm actually quite a shy person, but I like seeing if you can be able to be more outrageous than you are, being able to be disinhibited, see if you can feel like not being so shy.' </p> <p>Her shyness is another important, though unseen, factor in her art. It's what fires Gillian: the reason why she doesn't repeat her work is that she believes that as soon as the process becomes less nerve-wracking for her, as soon she relaxes and isn't nervous, then her art deteriorates. Once she became easy with approaching people for Signs, she noticed that the thoughts they wrote down became less interesting. Unusually, her shyness isn't hard work: she's very restful to be around.</p> <p>She communicates her liking for you through subtle little gestures, funny snuffly laughter. Actually, she's turned her shyness into an asset, I think. You can see why she strikes up friendships with tramps and kids, how she can work with people whom others can't. She's shy, so she never dominates or talks down. She gives you space to express yourself and she doesn't mind if that expression is unformed or inarticulate. She doesn't mind, because she herself finds it very hard to talk. In all senses: she hates talking about herself - 'I don't talk personally about anything with anyone. I'm totally opposite to what I try and create in my work' - and she can't physically do it, anyway. Gillian can't speak properly. Her words are jerky and swallowed, as though she's trying to suck them back as soon as she's uttered them, and she sometimes misses out vital phrases. Sometimes, her speech is almost incomprehensible. This is what she says when she tries to explain. </p> <p>'I actually was, I can talk a lot more now, but a few years ago I tried to talk, and I have changed a lot in my ability to talk, I couldn't just talk, talk to people, I've never been a great talker or just trying to think about, try to, try to be able to talk for many years. For years, still sometimes when I go to places I have to breathe to get my head lightheaded because I'm so nervous about, I can still have these kind of blocks where I can't, or if I do you can tell that I'm so nervous and what I'm saying is so bad. It's not to do with ideas at all, it's just the idea of talking really, just the talking about anything.' She laughs, composes herself, takes a breath. 'It's like I'm thinking more about my presence than I'm thinking about how you communicate.' </p> <p>Once, when she was temping, two of her work colleagues noticed: 'They said, \"You can't form a sentence can you?\" And it had never occurred to me before because in the relationships I had with my friends it wasn't actually about talking so much, it was just a laugh.' Gillian was working for an insurance company, so her colleagues made her work the counter, just to see if she could speak. 'And I did, and didn't actually say anything, just sort of nn uh yuh un uh.' Language, schmanguage: Gillian stopped reading books at 14. She left school two years later with no qualifications. At 18, she, Michelle and another girl called Kimberley all moved to London: Gillian temped and primped and tried to save for her rent. She stayed in hostels and lived off Mars Bars. And then, at 22, she managed to get a place on an art course, a B-Tech in Chelsea. From there, she went to Goldsmiths, in 1987; two years behind the breakthrough Hirst Frieze year. There, she was forced to speak. </p> <p>'In Goldsmiths, you had to explain why you were doing what you were doing,' says Gillian. 'And one of the first things I did was cutting up books. It was something to do with language and my inability to use it. They asked me why I was cutting books, in front of all the students, and all I could say was, I don't like 'em.' </p> <p>Yet another of her adolescent traits that came good in her art. She explores language beautifully now - allowing people to speak as they wish, freeing them by letting them hide behind masks, or write things down, or by, in the case of Drunk, letting her subjects - a group of local homeless people - express themselves, yet not really speak properly at all. </p> <p>Gillian - still shy, still inarticulate, still interested in others and not in herself - shows just how eloquent lack of eloquence can be. The day after we meet, Gillian phones me up. Her speech is scattershot: she says she feels as though we'd gone through a very intense experience. 'When I was talking to you,' she says, 'I started thinking that the answers I was giving were just what I thought at that moment. Sometimes not even that. They were just answers because that's what you're meant to do when someone asks you a question.' She suggests meeting up to do something more light-hearted. Fine, but what? A spot of prodding and Gillian spits it out. She really, really loves roller coasters. So we decide to go to Alton Towers. </p> <p>When we get there, Gillian confesses that she likes funfairs so much that she persuaded Michael to go to one on their first date. Which shows how keen he was, because he hates scary rides, apparently. She'd met him at Goldsmiths and she liked him because 'he was so smiley and friendly. He can talk to anyone' - but they didn't get it together until four years ago. Anyhow, when they did, they went on a trip around England's theme parks: Blackpool, Alton Towers, Chessington. They stayed in the Alton Towers Hotel, but couldn't afford a themed room. Still, there were people dressed as animals wandering through the foyer all night: 'It was amazing,' sighs Gillian. I like roller coasters, and we have a lovely time. </p> <p>We buy a commemorative all-action photo whenever we can, and treat ourselves to a gourmet McDonald's at the end. During the day, we chat about this and that. About the Turner Prize (she got very drunk, made 'a really embarrassing speech that no one could understand', went to the Atlantic Bar, and fell asleep; she didn't produce any work for about a year afterwards). About music (she hated Pulp's Common People, but loved their last, dark LP). About food (she got the sack from McDonald's because she was so slow that all the customers asked for their money back). And city kid Gillian misreads the Alton Towers map and leads us literally up a very long garden path. She huffs and puffs all the way. </p> <p>And I change my mind about Gillian. She's normal, but not in the way I thought. What's nice about her is that, actually, she's an unusual, quite eccentric person, a 'proper' artist - but that's all hidden behind her easy-going mask of ordinariness. She's like her subjects. She's like everyone else. Normal, but not at all underneath. An undercover correspondent sending weird dispatches back from the frontline of the mundane. 'Oh, I don't think anyone's ordinary,' says Gillian Wearing. 'Everyone's different. Everyone has something special about them.'</p> <p>\u0095 Gillian Wearing, the Serpentine Gallery, Kensington Gardens, London W2 (020 7402 6075), from 14 September to 29 October Sponsored by Selfridges &amp; Co in association with The Observer</p>",

      "bodyText": "Alton Towers, August 2000. At the highest point of Oblivion, just before you make the screaming, vertical 60m plunge into the black hole of the earth, your seat tips forward so that you hang for a few seconds, facing the ground, contemplating the inevitable. It's terrifying. Too much perspective. Then the car drops straight down, there's a flash of light and you hurtle into darkness, a strangely cold, wet darkness... until, just as it feels as though you really will have a heart attack, you level out, shoot round a corner and surface. Premature exhilaration. 'It's all about death, isn't it?' says Gillian Wearing cheerfully, as we collect our souvenir picture. She studies it quizzically. 'Next time,' she says, 'we should try and look nonchalant.' Artists are meant to be odd bods; it's part of their job description. But the recent crop of so-called YBAs (Young British Artists: Damien Hirst, Sarah Lucas, Tracey Emin, et al), while not exactly conventional, have always seemed more approachable, more understandable, less bohemian, isolated and disengaged from reality than the artist stereotype. YBAs get drunk and rowdy. They like pop music and TV. They dress like your mates. They make work that is about everyday life and everyday death (and they don't paint it in oils, which is possibly why they have so much time to socialise). So it's no surprise that when you first meet Gillian Wearing, YBA, BA (Goldsmiths), winner of the 1997 Turner Prize, you think: oh, she's dead normal. Gillian, 36, has a young face and long, straight black hair, and she wears men's trousers and patterned shirts. She drinks hot Ribena; she talks about Big Brother. There's nothing particularly attention-seeking about her (unlike, say, Tracey or Damien): she seems a bit shy, though not unfriendly. We meet at Gillian's home in unsalubrious Borough, south London, a Peabody-type flat that's far too tiny for her and her artist boyfriend Michael Landy. Kitchen, sitting room, bedroom, bathroom, all of tiddly proportions. No evidence of a DIY ethic: the sitting room is a teetering clutter of boxes and videos and magazines; the walls are grubby white. There are no pictures, anywhere, other than a large photograph of a young girl with her writing underneath, pinned to the sitting-room wall. Clearly some of Gillian's work. I have a quick look: 'Oh, it's not finished yet,' says Gillian nervously. 'I feel funny about people seeing work when I haven't quite worked out what to do with it.' From 14 September to 29 October, the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gardens will be host to a Gillian Wearing solo exhibition. Sponsored by The Observer, the show will include older work, such as Dancing in Peckham, Sasha and Mum, 2 into 1 , Homage to the Woman..., plus some new stuff: Drunk, Trauma. None of this may mean anything to you, but you'll have had a taste of Gillian's art, even if you've never been to one of her shows. You know that VW advert that shows a security guard, a harassed mother and others holding up a handwritten sign that says what they're supposedly feeling (the security guard's one says 'Sensitive', the mother's 'Sex Chocolate Sex Chocolate'). Well, that's a, ahem, tribute to one of Gillian's photographic works: 1993's Signs that say what you want them to say and not signs that say what someone else wants you to say. Gillian's sign-holders were real people, strangers that she approached on the street and got to write down what they happened to be feeling at the time. The results were unexpected, and unexpectedly touching. The one that everyone remembers is the young businessman whose sign reads, 'I'm Desperate', although I have a soft spot for the chap who displays, with some pride, 'I've thought about being a gigolo but I'm worried about the health risks'. After another advert - for a computer game - again drew on one of Gillian's pieces ( 2 into 1, where the voice of a mother and her sons are transposed, so that the boys speak the mother's words and vice versa), Gillian made a public protest. 'It did really annoy me,' she says now. 'I was annoyed that the advertisers passed it off as though they'd had this unique idea. It's not like you've taken a scene out of a film that everyone knows. There's no references. It's just theft.' Gillian's work is often funny, always human, humane and democratic. It's easy to understand, too, which is probably why it's appropriated by ad agencies; it draws on real life. In Dancing in Peckham , she dances wildly, without music, in a South London shopping centre. Confess all on video. Don't worry, you will be in disguise. Intrigued? Call Gillian shows people in strange masks (Neil Kinnock, George Bush) telling their secrets. Phaidon have a lovely book of Gillian's work: when I went through it, I thought she'd make a brilliant journalist, or documentary maker. She reveals details of people that mostly remain hidden; she talks to people - down-and-outs, kids - who mostly pass unnoticed. She says she thinks of much of her work as portraiture, but portraits where the subject has some personal voice, 'because it's too easy for a photograph to make people look like something they're not'. That's why the picture of the girl on the sitting-room wall has the girl's own carefully rounded writing underneath it. Gillian hasn't got a studio at the moment, which partially explains the chaos of her flat. And it is chaos. There's no hidden system: when she tries to find a video of the preparation she did for Dancing in Peckham , she spends a good quarter of an hour trying to locate it. 'It is here somewhere,' she murmurs. 'I saw it just before you arrived.' She rummages through boxes. The cat hides behind the sofa. Probably a good time to go through Gillian's history. Gillian Clare Wearing was born on 10 December 1963, in Handsworth, Birmingham, the middle child of three - older sister Jainne-Ann, younger brother Richard. Her dad, Brian, sold televisions; Jean, her mum, was a butcher; the family lived in a three-bedroomed house in Great Barr. ('A city kid. I still am. I'd rather see the countryside in a film; I stay in the car when people go for walks.') Gillian's parents split up when she was in her early teens: she says she can't remember exactly when, because her dad had phases of living elsewhere, 'in other women's houses, I think. It's vague territory.' I ask her which of her parents she thinks she's most like. To my surprise, she's entirely thrown by the question, stares at me, starts swallowing her words: 'I, um, er, I, I, well, I've, um never thought about it.' She's not unhappy about me asking; it's just that she genuinely hasn't a clue how to answer. She calls Michael out of the kitchen, asks him what he thinks. He says he hasn't met her family often enough to tell. After five minutes deliberation, Gillian finally offers, with a laugh: 'Well, my father liked to argue things out. Not have shouting arguments, but argue, meaning discussion.' Gillian herself appears very non-confrontational. But then, perhaps she's hit her post-adolescent mellow period: 'I was put on report on my first day in secondary school. I hit a teacher.' Blimey. Why? 'She hit me.' On the same day, Gillian met Christine Knight. She approached her because 'her shoes were much better than mine' (they were platforms). Christine and Gillian became friends, went to Aston Villa football matches together. Throughout her teens and early twenties, Gillian would have one close girlfriend, maybe two: when she grew apart from Christine, Michelle Markam became Gillian's closest mate. Gillian and Michelle listened to music together, tried out make-up, began to bunk off school. One day, while they were wagging, they bumped into Gillian's dad: 'We were all dolled up: it was our punk phase, we must have been 14. And we saw him. He walked about 10ft away from us, stared straight through us. I never worked out if he'd actually recognised us or not.' School wasn't going too well. Outside school was getting better and better. Punk happened, swiftly followed by ska and rude boy, then new romantic, then Goth. Gillian had a haircut for each. he shows me a picture of the three Wearing children on holiday in Cornwall. Jainne-Ann has a perm and a saucy look; Richard is pulling faces and giving the thumbs up. Gillian is at the back, in her rude-girl phase, hair and face just so, hin up, all bravado and no smiling. About 15 years old. She's barely recognisable. Looks were very important to Gillian, when she was young. She recalls the hours she'd spend on white, pancake make-up, fussing with her unco-oporative hair, drawing lines around her eyes to make them bigger, squeezing into a ridiculous taffeta skirt so tight that 'I could only make fairy steps.' On Saturday nights, she'd go round to Michelle's to go out. But Michelle took even longer than Gillian to get ready. 'By the time we caught the 51 bus and made it all the way into town, it was time to catch the last one back again. Still,' says Gillian, wryly, 'at least everyone on the bus saw what we looked like.' The girls started to go to nightclubs (though 'we never drank. We couldn't afford it'), places like Rumrunner, where pre-fame Duran Duran and Boy George hung out. Sometimes, George would catch the bus with Gillian. She recalls seeing him dance: he had this move where he waggled his hand in front of his face (she demonstrates: it appears that the lovely George was trying to flush himself down the toilet). Gillian thought George's dance was just fantastic. It's simplistic, but you could say that Gillian's teenage years and passions eventually turned themselves inside out and became her work. She herself notes that it wasn't until she went to art school that she gave up putting so much artistry into her own appearance. Up until then, she was her own canvas.

      "body": "<p>It was a fairly routine Orange County police call; a man was threatening to commit suicide by diving off the 17th floor of the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress Hotel, just two miles from Disneyworld, Florida. </p> <p>When they reached the balcony just before 10am on 20 February 1992, police officers found a deranged 42-year-old man perched on the balcony ledge. Police officer Stan Spanich spent 40 minutes coaxing the man back into his room, 1708. Inside, flat out on the bed suffering a cocaine overdose was 22-year-old Denise Wojcik from the local Escorts-in-a-Flash agency. Denise said she and an 'associate', Sherri, had spent the night in the room's sunken Jacuzzi with the would-be suicide snorting cocaine through rolled up $100 bills. The big man, 6ft 4in, paranoid on coke, said he was Irish, he was a businessman, and his name was Ben Dunne. </p> <p>None of it meant very much to the Florida police officers; arresting people strung out on cocaine was a daily occurrence in the Sunshine State. But 3,000 miles on the other, wetter side of the Atlantic in Ireland, Ben Dunne was a very big man indeed. Dunne was one of the most prominent businessmen in the Irish State. His billion-pound supermarket retail empire supplied the majority of Irish households with the food for their tables and the shirts on their backs. Dunne was also, in secret, a major benefactor of the Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey. </p> <p>For 30 years Haughey, whose hero was Napoleon, had bestrode the narrow Irish political stage dominating friend and foe. Charlie, as he was universally known, had held every major office of state and was Taoiseach of Ireland four times. </p> <p>Haughey was rich. He lived in a glorious 18th-century mansion, filled with art, on the outskirts of Dublin. In the 270 acres of his Kinsealy estate he ran a horse stud and bred racecourse winners. He owned an island off Ireland's west coast, Innishvicillaun, that was so remote the building materials for his house had to be helicoptered in. He had an ocean yacht. He spent lavishly, \u00a3700 Charvet shirts from Paris, \u00a31,000 meals in Dublin's most exclusive Le Coq Hardi restaurant, the best wine, vintage Cristal champagne, and even in Catholic Ireland, the best of mistresses. As Taoiseach he rubbed shoulders with the great and powerful - President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand was a friend, and there were the usual St Patrick's Day lunches at the White House and tea, albeit it frosty given the state of Anglo-Irish relations, with Prime Minister Thatcher in Downing Street. </p> <p>But the fall out from Dunne's cocaine binge would tortuously but relentlessly, destroy the achievements, the fortune and the entire reputation of a man who was once frequently compared to the legendary, romantic IRA leader Michael Collins. </p> <p> These days Haughey is still at the cen tre of the Irish political stage. But he is no longer welcoming Europe's leaders to EU summits in the splendour of Dublin Castle. Instead, for two hours every day, he is in the witness box at an anti-corruption tribunal answering questions as to where all the money for the mistress, the mansion and the racehorses came from. </p> <p>For the last two years lawyers at the specially convened Moriarty Tribunal have combed through every Haughey bank statement, every invoice, every property deal he was involved in over the past 30 years in search of evidence of bribery. What they found is damning. Haughey was a career politician whose annual salary even as Taoiseach in the 90s never exceeded \u00a375,000 per annum. Yet more than \u00a38.5m flowed through Haughey's secret bank accounts to fund his lavish lifestyle. </p> <p>The hidden accounts, the secret transfers, and the network of the rich and powerful who made out their cheques to 'Charles Haughey &amp; Co' point to one conclusion; that Charles Haughey ran for public office to make himself rich and then ran Ireland and the Irish State for the benefit of his cronies. It was a neat quid pro quo and the quid ended up in Charlie's pocket. </p> <p>'He was the boss. We all looked up to him, the whole Irish nation looked up to him. He stood up to Mrs Thatcher. But all that is undermined by the fact that he was conning us. What really cuts is that all he wanted was to be in power, to have power. And he abused it,' said Steven Kelly, a student who queued to be in the public gallery of the tribunal. </p> <p>Haughey may be unloved, but he is not defeated. Citing ill-health and age, he is 74, he is only allowed to be questioned for two hours a day. He is far from contrite. </p> <p>In the witness box, hood-eyed, he scowls at his interrogator as he is minutely led through one damning document after another highlighting his extravagance, his mysterious land-developer friends and their coincidental business dealings with the Irish State. His answers are a never-ending stream of denials, omissions and evasions. 'I can't remember, I do not recollect, not in any detail, I do not have any recollection.' When he is not taking the Irish equivalent of the Fifth Amendment - about self-incrimination - on the basis of his now allegedly faulty memory, Haughey lays the blame on his old financial manager and secret bagman Des Traynor who is wonderfully, discreetly, but indisputably dead. </p> <p>It is a bravura performance. But it cannot alter the truth. For the past 40 years, bribery and corruption, rather than elections, were the life-blood of Irish politics. The next Irish general election is less than two years away, but a political revolution is coming. All the established parties are facing wipe-out. The beneficiaries will be some of the smaller parties and Gerry Adams's Sinn Fein - fighting as the squeaky-clean newcomers. </p> <p>The taint of scandal has even touched the current Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, Haughey's prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Testifying to the Moriarty Tribunal, he admitted signing entire books of blank cheques for his former leader - cheques drawn on an Irish government account that Haughey later used to pay his Paris shirt bills. 'What Haughey says about Ireland is not very good. It says Ireland is a small coun try and a lot of people in the professions, pillars of the establishment, covered up for him out of fear and greed. It's easy to be abusive about Haughey now, but standing up to him 20 years ago was a different matter. All the stuff about Mafia-style leadership was not a joke,' said Joe Joyce, author of The Boss , a hostile biography of Haughey. </p> <p>In Haughey's potato republic, only little people paid their taxes. It was government of the people in favour of the few. But the web of power around Haughey was impenetrable. It would take Ben Dunne's suicide bid and a high-stakes legal battle for the Dunnes retail empire to finally expose the rotten core of Haughey's Ireland. </p> <p> Haughey was the Juan Peron of Irish politics. Like the glamorous Argentinian dictator, he inspired a fanatical following with his peculiar blend of nationalist fervour, right-wing views and appeasement of powerful trade union leaders. He was master of the small political gesture - granting tax exemption to artists and free travel to retirees - and was hugely popular. He was also the supreme practitioner of the Irish political art of 'cute hoorism' ('a clever whore'), slyly outmanoeuvring his opponents with backstage deals. He cultivated his image as the man of power, the man of decision, the very embodiment of the Irish nation. </p> <p>Party conferences were carefully orchestrated to create an aura around the leader with a personalised theme tune, 'Arise and Follow Charlie'. He loved photo-calls but hated reporters' prying questions; he was always acutely self-conscious of his height, 5ft 6in, and avoided situations where he physically looked up to those he politically looked down upon. </p> <p>'If you opposed him you were seen as not just being disloyal to him as an individual, but to the party and the country - words that were always mentioned in the same breath - as well. That's why it was so hugely dangerous and that's where you got the slightly fascist overtones of the whole thing,' said his bitter political rival Des O'Malley, who was expelled from the ruling Fianna Fail party on Haughey's orders. </p> <p>Irish corridors of power hummed with fear and tales of his cutting sarcastic tongue. Haughey, always aloof and imperious, once called a senator into his office to give him a furious dressing down. After a tirade of insults, Haughey dismissed him and returned to the work on his desk. The stunned senator, confused by the wood panelling, could not find his way out. After a few moments Haughey looked up. The hapless senator explained his predicament. 'Then why don't you jump out the fucking window,' retorted Haughey. </p> <p>Far from being shocked, the Irish fell in love with a politician whose earthy nature and soaring ambition they somehow saw as a better reflection of themselves than his bumbling saintly Fine Gael political rival Garret Fitzgerald. Charlie may have been a bit of a crook but, his followers reasoned, he was our sort of nice crook. </p> <p>He had chutzpah. One of his first acts as Taoiseach was to lecture the Irish people about living beyond their economic means. At the same time his own extravagance wildly outstripped his income. For decades he ran up a crippling personal IR\u00a3750,000 overdraft with one of Ireland's major banks, Allied Irish, when his annual salary at the time was IR\u00a35,500. Demands by the bank for repayment were met by threats and pointed remarks about his political power. 'It was blatantly obvious that he was living a lifestyle he could not afford. It was staring everyone in the face, the helicopters, the ridiculously expensive girlfriend. He was up to something,' says Vincent Browne, one of the few Irish journalists ever to question Haughey openly about his wealth. </p> <p> Haughey certainly needed money and lots of it. Although he married Maureen Lemass, the daughter of a former Taoiseach, and had four children, he also had a high-profile affair with a Dublin gos sip columnist. His mistress, Terry Keane, was a woman who expected and received the very best her lover could lavish upon her from vintage Cristal champagne at \u00a3200-a-bottle, jewellery from Tiffany's in New York to luxurious holidays abroad. Like his hero Napoleon, Haughey was no movie star, but he oozed, according to Keane, sex appeal and had 'the most beautiful mouth of anybody I'd ever seen'. </p> <p>Keane, now 60, is no longer quite the beauty that turned a Taoiseach's head, but she remains a spirited, spiky woman with an unashamed fondness for fur coats, heavy-set gold jewellery and la dolce vita. It was not, she insists, love at first sight, but it did become a tempestuous passion. 'We were both chancers and we shared the same cynical sense of humour. I knew it would be a mistake to let him know how mad I was about him. We often drank too much when we could get away together and had terrible rows, but usually we had them in private,' said Keane, who remained married to her husband, a Supreme Court judge. </p> <p>The couple met for weekly trysts in luxury hotels around Dublin or dined privately at their favourite restaurant Le Coq Hardi. 'Charlie was great fun, a great raconteur, and a good companion. He had an unwavering belief in himself. He always seemed very certain of where he was going and what he was going to achieve. He was never daunted by the obstacles, they were always challenges.' </p> <p>The affair, which began in 1972, was soon an open secret in Dublin media circles. Keane anointed herself with the semi-official title of Taoiseach's Mistress and terrorised those beneath her in the rigid Irish social pecking order, including once an unfortunate young policeman who had the audacity to give her a parking ticket. 'I am,' she would declare, 'the most powerful woman in Ireland; wife of a Supreme Court judge and mistress of a Taoiseach.' She even regularly hinted about 'sweetie' in her weekly gossip column for a Dublin newspaper. </p> <p>Keane was less popular in other Dublin circles where she was regarded as vain, empty-headed and bitchy. But the true nature of her relationship to Haughey, which would have scandalised a country that still banned condoms for unmarried couples, was never revealed to the Irish people. Ireland's strict libel laws kept Haughey's adultery off the front pages, even when he denounced attempts in 1986 to introduce divorce. Ireland was still too small a country, its ruling elite too tiny, for such secrets to be shared with the masses. For years the same cloying subservience towards power would protect Haughey's secret financial affairs. </p> <p> The source of Haughey's wealth may have been mysterious, but the scale of it certainly wasn't. In 1969, after a decade as a full-time government minister, Haughey bought Abbeville, the James Gandon-designed mansion that had been the summer home of the English Lord Lieutenants of Ireland, for IR\u00a3120,000. The 10-bedroom Georgian mansion, on the outskirts of Dublin, complete with 270 acres, was an astounding purchase. Gandon's other buildings in Ireland include the majestic Four Courts, home of the Irish judiciary, and the historic Dublin Custom House - a drawing of which adorns the back of Irish IR\u00a35 bill. </p> <p>Abbeville is one of the greatest houses in Ireland, the renovation and upkeep alone consumed vast sums, yet Haughey's ministerial salary in the 60s never exceeded IR\u00a35,500, a 20th of the purchase price. Nor was there any family wealth - Haughey had been brought up in a council house and money was tight. But when pressed about the origins of this impressive wealth, he refused to disclose his finances. 'Talk to my bank manager,' he retorted. </p> <p>Conveniently, Haughey's bank manager, Des Traynor, a secretive accountant who controlled all of his master's finances, did not give interviews. Indeed, Traynor, despite being on the board of a whole network of prestigious Irish companies - including the state airline, Aer Lingus - was virtually unknown to Irish journalists. </p> <p>Haughey's four administrations, in the 80s and 90s, were awash with scandals from the illegal bugging of journalists, to the discovery of a wanted double murderer in the attorney general's apartment and even to the arrest of Haughey's personal election agent Pat O'Connor Pat O'Connor, as he humorously became known, for voting twice in the same 1982 election. Most scandals were financial and, although not proven, were never far from Haughey's door. </p> <p>In early 1992, Haughey's luck finally ran out when an old phone-tapping scandal about the illegal bugging of journalists' telephones resurfaced. Haughey had blamed his minister of justice Sean Doherty and denied all personal knowledge of the telephone intercepts. Doherty willingly took the rap and was forced from government. But 10 years later, Doherty changed his story and said Haughey had ordered the bugging. Haughey resigned on 11 February 1992, with a vintage performance in which he quoted Othello. 'I have done the State some service, they know't; no more of that.' </p> <p>Nine days later, Ben Dunne's Florida escapade hit the Irish newspapers. Headlines come and go, but for Dunne's siblings, particularly his sister Margaret Heffernan, members of the Dunne family trust that had overall control of the retail chain of stores, it was the final straw. For years, the family had been angered by their brother's autocratic behaviour; she decided to oust him from the Dunnes' board. A full-scale family war for the billion-pound empire broke out during which details of Dunne's secret gifts, actually company money, to Haughey were revealed to Heffernan for the first time. She was amazed. Her late father, Bernard Dunne, the store's founder, had detested Haughey. Heffernan had a simple response: she wanted the money back. </p> <p>According to Dunne, he first learned that Haughey was in financial difficulties in 1987. Traynor, Haughey's accountant and secret bagman, had phoned up Dunne's legal advisor and asked for cash. Dunne agreed to pay IR\u00a31.3m from secret accounts within the far-flung Dunne empire. Traynor acted as a cut-out; the money was routed into offshore bank accounts. There was nothing to connect Dunne and Haughey. </p> <p>But then, by chance, in early November 1991, Dunne called on Haughey in Abbeville after playing a game of golf nearby. Haughey, besieged by the latest crisis in his government, looked uncharacteristically down. Dunne happened to have three blank sterling bank drafts for \u00a370,000 each in his pocket. He handed them to Haughey. 'Look, that is something for yourself.' Haughey responded: 'Thank you, big fellow.' The exchange of drafts was over within seconds, but it would in the end crucify Charles Haughey. </p> <p>Despite Dunne's evidence to Heffernan's lawyers, Haughey, now in retirement, continued to deny that he had ever received money. Heffernan went to Abbeville and confronted him. Haughey, playing for time, was careful to neither deny or affirm receiving the money There was no proof. </p> <p>Haughey's sophistry cut little ice with either legal team in the Dunnes' dispute. Dunne's payments to Haughey, indicative of Ben Dunne's abuse of the firm's finances, had become a weapon in their own legal clash. Haughey, despite his carefully studied aloofness on his personal finances, was in a panic. He knew that public disclosure of the Dunne money, and all the embarrassing questions it would raise about his wealth, would destroy him. </p> <p>Suddenly it was Charles Haughey who started making begging phone calls, 11 in total, to Dunne's lawyer. He invited Heffernan back to Abbeville to urge her to resolve the family feud in private. In November 1994, just days before the case reached open court, the Dunnes' legal dispute was settled with a huge IR\u00a385m payment to Ben Dunne. Evidence of Dunne's secret 'gifts' was consigned to the legal dustbin. Haughey thought he had survived. There was even talk in 1996 of a run for the Irish presidency. </p> <p>But then in 1997 his carefully constructed fa\u00e7ade collapsed. Ben Dunne was caught out making illegal payments to another government minister. It was hugely embarrassing for the then Fine Gael government and it was forced to appoint a tribunal of enquiry to investigate payments to members of parliament by Dunne. Within days the tribunal, under the formidable Honourable Mr Justice Brian McCracken, was on the track of Charlie. </p> <p>This time there was no escape. Statements from the Dunnes' legal battle were retrieved from the archives, witnesses were called, and lawyers interrogated in the full public gaze of an open tribunal. Haughey stonewalled, prevaricated, hoping he could brazen it out, but the tribunal's investigators were relentless in their pursuit. They uncovered an elaborate financial system, organised by Traynor, which could be used to disguise the payment of bribes and the systematic defrauding of the Irish state of tax revenue. </p> <p>The system was simple but ingenious. Traynor, chairman of the small legitimate merchant bank Guinness Mahon, had established an offshore bank, Ansbacher Cayman Ltd in the Caribbean tax haven of the Cayman Islands, and acted as the Irish agent for its deposits. Money deposited would theoretically be held offshore beyond the scrutiny of the Irish tax authorities. Ansbacher Cayman then redeposited its funds in a consolidated account with Guinness Mahon in Dublin. </p> <p>Internal auditors for both banks expressed concern at the exposure to risk of mismanagement and fraud by Traynor's operation of the Ansbacher deposits. At one stage these reached IR\u00a338m and comprised one third of Guinness Mahon's liabilities. Access to the operations of the Ansbacher accounts and the coded names of the estimated 120 secret depositors was kept separate from all other bank business. None of the usual banking controls, paper documentation, independent supervision of staff, operated. The 'bank' was little more than a box of records that Traynor kept in the corner of his office. </p> <p>None of the money ever left Irish shores. When Haughey needed money Traynor simply transferred funds out of the hidden accounts and into the legitimate companies Haughey used to fund his lifestyle. </p> <p>'The guys running the show were ripping off taxes and all of it was being organised by Des Traynor. Charlie was a great Taoiseach to have around even if they did have to give him a bit of money. He was not exactly going to order an investigation into offshore accounts or give the revenue commissioners a new set of computers,' said a close observer of the tribunal proceedings. </p> <p>Despite the evidence against him Haughey still continued to deny all knowledge of money from Dunne until the very last moment. But the evidence of the bank drafts he had personally received from Ben Dunne was irrefutable. He was forced to issue a statement saying he had 'mistakenly' instructed his legal team and, yes, he had taken the money. He was a proven liar. </p> <p> Bizarrely, apart from Ben Dunne being top of the Haughey family wedding invitation list, McCracken found no evidence that Dunnes' companies received any favours from Haughey. 'Charlie would have had such a sense of noblesse oblige that he would think it was his entitlement. And he certainly would not have felt he was under an obligation. I suppose like Napoleon he went a bit barmy,' said his lover Keane. </p> <p>McCracken was not the end of Haughey's fall from grace; it was the beginning. McCracken was soon replaced by the Moriarty Tribunal tasked with trawling through his entire financial records. It discovered that businessmen keen for his favours invested tens of thousands of pounds in the Haughey family helicopter firm Celtic Helicopters. One such investor was Guy Snowden, the disgraced former American director of the national lottery firm Camelot, who lost his libel trial against Richard Branson over corruption allegations. </p> <p>As leader of Fianna Fail, Haughey also had control of the funds that the Irish state pays its political parties to help with staff and research costs. Money from that account, countersigned unknowingly by Bertie Ahern, ended up being used to pay his Charvet shirt bill, IR\u00a315, 000, and his bill, IR\u00a314,000, at Le Coq Hardi. An IR\u00a320,000 donation to the cancer fund of his seriously ill foreign minister Brian Lenihan, who received a liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic, ended up in the account of Celtic Helicopters. </p> <p>The new Ireland, a country of computer firms and the vibrant economically successful Celtic Tiger, was shocked and outraged at its hidden past of sleazy deals, bribery and Charles Haughey. The people turned. Instead of the saviour he was now the scoundrel of the nation. 'Haughey represents the corruption that ran through Irish society. He represents the centre of it all,' said Kevin Scally, a teacher who also queued to see Haughey in the witness box. </p> <p>Finally, even his mistress Terry Keane betrayed him by selling her story, and some highly embarrassing pictures of the couple kissing, to a Dublin newspaper in May 1999 for IR\u00a365,000 and auctioning off his old love tokens. To Haughey's fury, Keane also appeared on a popular Irish television chat show to expand on their relationship. Their 27-year relationship ended in a terse phone call the following day. 'Charlie didn't so much think that he would not get caught, he thought it would not matter if he did,' said Keane tartly. </p> <p> Like his hero Napoleon, Haughey, when he is not in the witness box, spends his final days in a gilded mansion, Abbeville, that has become his prison. He is deserted and alone, railing against his enemies and lamenting what could have been. Nothing will erase the ignominy, the shame, of his fall. It may be just, but it is a bitter end to an illustrious career. Even Charles Haughey might be forgiven for cursing that Florida police officer, far away across the Atlantic, who stopped Ben Dunne, and his secrets, from jumping from the Hyatt Regency's 17th floor balcony.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was a fairly routine Orange County police call; a man was threatening to commit suicide by diving off the 17th floor of the Hyatt Regency Grand Cypress Hotel, just two miles from Disneyworld, Florida. When they reached the balcony just before 10am on 20 February 1992, police officers found a deranged 42-year-old man perched on the balcony ledge. Police officer Stan Spanich spent 40 minutes coaxing the man back into his room, 1708. Inside, flat out on the bed suffering a cocaine overdose was 22-year-old Denise Wojcik from the local Escorts-in-a-Flash agency. Denise said she and an 'associate', Sherri, had spent the night in the room's sunken Jacuzzi with the would-be suicide snorting cocaine through rolled up $100 bills. The big man, 6ft 4in, paranoid on coke, said he was Irish, he was a businessman, and his name was Ben Dunne. None of it meant very much to the Florida police officers; arresting people strung out on cocaine was a daily occurrence in the Sunshine State. But 3,000 miles on the other, wetter side of the Atlantic in Ireland, Ben Dunne was a very big man indeed. Dunne was one of the most prominent businessmen in the Irish State. His billion-pound supermarket retail empire supplied the majority of Irish households with the food for their tables and the shirts on their backs. Dunne was also, in secret, a major benefactor of the Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey. For 30 years Haughey, whose hero was Napoleon, had bestrode the narrow Irish political stage dominating friend and foe.

He spent lavishly, \u00a3700 Charvet shirts from Paris, \u00a31,000 meals in Dublin's most exclusive Le Coq Hardi restaurant, the best wine, vintage Cristal champagne, and even in Catholic Ireland, the best of mistresses. As Taoiseach he rubbed shoulders with the great and powerful - President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand was a friend, and there were the usual St Patrick's Day lunches at the White House and tea, albeit it frosty given the state of Anglo-Irish relations, with Prime Minister Thatcher in Downing Street. But the fall out from Dunne's cocaine binge would tortuously but relentlessly, destroy the achievements, the fortune and the entire reputation of a man who was once frequently compared to the legendary, romantic IRA leader Michael Collins. These days Haughey is still at the cen tre of the Irish political stage. But he is no longer welcoming Europe's leaders to EU summits in the splendour of Dublin Castle.

Demands by the bank for repayment were met by threats and pointed remarks about his political power. 'It was blatantly obvious that he was living a lifestyle he could not afford. It was staring everyone in the face, the helicopters, the ridiculously expensive girlfriend. He was up to something,' says Vincent Browne, one of the few Irish journalists ever to question Haughey openly about his wealth. Haughey certainly needed money and lots of it. Although he married Maureen Lemass, the daughter of a former Taoiseach, and had four children, he also had a high-profile affair with a Dublin gos sip columnist. His mistress, Terry Keane, was a woman who expected and received the very best her lover could lavish upon her from vintage Cristal champagne at \u00a3200-a-bottle, jewellery from Tiffany's in New York to luxurious holidays abroad. Like his hero Napoleon, Haughey was no movie star, but he oozed, according to Keane, sex appeal and had 'the most beautiful mouth of anybody I'd ever seen'. Keane, now 60, is no longer quite the beauty that turned a Taoiseach's head, but she remains a spirited, spiky woman with an unashamed fondness for fur coats, heavy-set gold jewellery and la dolce vita. It was not, she insists, love at first sight, but it did become a tempestuous passion. 'We were both chancers and we shared the same cynical sense of humour. I knew it would be a mistake to let him know how mad I was about him. We often drank too much when we could get away together and had terrible rows, but usually we had them in private,' said Keane, who remained married to her husband, a Supreme Court judge. The couple met for weekly trysts in luxury hotels around Dublin or dined privately at their favourite restaurant Le Coq Hardi. 'Charlie was great fun, a great raconteur, and a good companion. He had an unwavering belief in himself. He always seemed very certain of where he was going and what he was going to achieve. He was never daunted by the obstacles, they were always challenges.' The affair, which began in 1972, was soon an open secret in Dublin media circles. Keane anointed herself with the semi-official title of Taoiseach's Mistress and terrorised those beneath her in the rigid Irish social pecking order, including once an unfortunate young policeman who had the audacity to give her a parking ticket. 'I am,' she would declare, 'the most powerful woman in Ireland; wife of a Supreme Court judge and mistress of a Taoiseach.' She even regularly hinted about 'sweetie' in her weekly gossip column for a Dublin newspaper. Keane was less popular in other Dublin circles where she was regarded as vain, empty-headed and bitchy. But the true nature of her relationship to Haughey, which would have scandalised a country that still banned condoms for unmarried couples, was never revealed to the Irish people. Ireland's strict libel laws kept Haughey's adultery off the front pages, even when he denounced attempts in 1986 to introduce divorce. Ireland was still too small a country, its ruling elite too tiny, for such secrets to be shared with the masses. For years the same cloying subservience towards power would protect Haughey's secret financial affairs. The source of Haughey's wealth may have been mysterious, but the scale of it certainly wasn't. In 1969, after a decade as a full-time government minister, Haughey bought Abbeville, the James Gandon-designed mansion that had been the summer home of the English Lord Lieutenants of Ireland, for IR\u00a3120,000. The 10-bedroom Georgian mansion, on the outskirts of Dublin, complete with 270 acres, was an astounding purchase. Gandon's other buildings in Ireland include the majestic Four Courts, home of the Irish judiciary, and the historic Dublin Custom House - a drawing of which adorns the back of Irish IR\u00a35 bill. Abbeville is one of the greatest houses in Ireland, the renovation and upkeep alone consumed vast sums, yet Haughey's ministerial salary in the 60s never exceeded IR\u00a35,500, a 20th of the purchase price. Nor was there any family wealth - Haughey had been brought up in a council house and money was tight. But when pressed about the origins of this impressive wealth, he refused to disclose his finances. 'Talk to my bank manager,' he retorted. Conveniently, Haughey's bank manager, Des Traynor, a secretive accountant who controlled all of his master's finances, did not give interviews. Indeed, Traynor, despite being on the board of a whole network of prestigious Irish companies - including the state airline, Aer Lingus - was virtually unknown to Irish journalists. Haughey's four administrations, in the 80s and 90s, were awash with scandals from the illegal bugging of journalists, to the discovery of a wanted double murderer in the attorney general's apartment and even to the arrest of Haughey's personal election agent Pat O'Connor Pat O'Connor, as he humorously became known, for voting twice in the same 1982 election. Most scandals were financial and, although not proven, were never far from Haughey's door. In early 1992, Haughey's luck finally ran out when an old phone-tapping scandal about the illegal bugging of journalists' telephones resurfaced. Haughey had blamed his minister of justice Sean Doherty and denied all personal knowledge of the telephone intercepts. Doherty willingly took the rap and was forced from government. But 10 years later, Doherty changed his story and said Haughey had ordered the bugging. Haughey resigned on 11 February 1992, with a vintage performance in which he quoted Othello. 'I have done the State some service, they know't; no more of that.' Nine days later, Ben Dunne's Florida escapade hit the Irish newspapers. Headlines come and go, but for Dunne's siblings, particularly his sister Margaret Heffernan, members of the Dunne family trust that had overall control of the retail chain of stores, it was the final straw. For years, the family had been angered by their brother's autocratic behaviour; she decided to oust him from the Dunnes' board. A full-scale family war for the billion-pound empire broke out during which details of Dunne's secret gifts, actually company money, to Haughey were revealed to Heffernan for the first time. She was amazed. Her late father, Bernard Dunne, the store's founder, had detested Haughey. Heffernan had a simple response: she wanted the money back. According to Dunne, he first learned that Haughey was in financial difficulties in 1987. Traynor, Haughey's accountant and secret bagman, had phoned up Dunne's legal advisor and asked for cash. Dunne agreed to pay IR\u00a31.3m from secret accounts within the far-flung Dunne empire. Traynor acted as a cut-out; the money was routed into offshore bank accounts. There was nothing to connect Dunne and Haughey. But then, by chance, in early November 1991, Dunne called on Haughey in Abbeville after playing a game of golf nearby. Haughey, besieged by the latest crisis in his government, looked uncharacteristically down. Dunne happened to have three blank sterling bank drafts for \u00a370,000 each in his pocket. He handed them to Haughey. 'Look, that is something for yourself.' Haughey responded: 'Thank you, big fellow.' The exchange of drafts was over within seconds, but it would in the end crucify Charles Haughey. Despite Dunne's evidence to Heffernan's lawyers, Haughey, now in retirement, continued to deny that he had ever received money. Heffernan went to Abbeville and confronted him. Haughey, playing for time, was careful to neither deny or affirm receiving the money There was no proof. Haughey's sophistry cut little ice with either legal team in the Dunnes' dispute. Dunne's payments to Haughey, indicative of Ben Dunne's abuse of the firm's finances, had become a weapon in their own legal clash. Haughey, despite his carefully studied aloofness on his personal finances, was in a panic. He knew that public disclosure of the Dunne money, and all the embarrassing questions it would raise about his wealth, would destroy him. Suddenly it was Charles Haughey who started making begging phone calls, 11 in total, to Dunne's lawyer. He invited Heffernan back to Abbeville to urge her to resolve the family feud in private. In November 1994, just days before the case reached open court, the Dunnes' legal dispute was settled with a huge IR\u00a385m payment to Ben Dunne. Evidence of Dunne's secret 'gifts' was consigned to the legal dustbin. Haughey thought he had survived. There was even talk in 1996 of a run for the Irish presidency. But then in 1997 his carefully constructed fa\u00e7ade collapsed. Ben Dunne was caught out making illegal payments to another government minister. It was hugely embarrassing for the then Fine Gael government and it was forced to appoint a tribunal of enquiry to investigate payments to members of parliament by Dunne. Within days the tribunal, under the formidable Honourable Mr Justice Brian McCracken, was on the track of Charlie. This time there was no escape. Statements from the Dunnes' legal battle were retrieved from the archives, witnesses were called, and lawyers interrogated in the full public gaze of an open tribunal. Haughey stonewalled, prevaricated, hoping he could brazen it out, but the tribunal's investigators were relentless in their pursuit. They uncovered an elaborate financial system, organised by Traynor, which could be used to disguise the payment of bribes and the systematic defrauding of the Irish state of tax revenue. The system was simple but ingenious. Traynor, chairman of the small legitimate merchant bank Guinness Mahon, had established an offshore bank, Ansbacher Cayman Ltd in the Caribbean tax haven of the Cayman Islands, and acted as the Irish agent for its deposits. Money deposited would theoretically be held offshore beyond the scrutiny of the Irish tax authorities. Ansbacher Cayman then redeposited its funds in a consolidated account with Guinness Mahon in Dublin. Internal auditors for both banks expressed concern at the exposure to risk of mismanagement and fraud by Traynor's operation of the Ansbacher deposits. At one stage these reached IR\u00a338m and comprised one third of Guinness Mahon's liabilities. Access to the operations of the Ansbacher accounts and the coded names of the estimated 120 secret depositors was kept separate from all other bank business. None of the usual banking controls, paper documentation, independent supervision of staff, operated. The 'bank' was little more than a box of records that Traynor kept in the corner of his office. None of the money ever left Irish shores. When Haughey needed money Traynor simply transferred funds out of the hidden accounts and into the legitimate companies Haughey used to fund his lifestyle. 'The guys running the show were ripping off taxes and all of it was being organised by Des Traynor. Charlie was a great Taoiseach to have around even if they did have to give him a bit of money. He was not exactly going to order an investigation into offshore accounts or give the revenue commissioners a new set of computers,' said a close observer of the tribunal proceedings. Despite the evidence against him Haughey still continued to deny all knowledge of money from Dunne until the very last moment. But the evidence of the bank drafts he had personally received from Ben Dunne was irrefutable. He was forced to issue a statement saying he had 'mistakenly' instructed his legal team and, yes, he had taken the money. He was a proven liar. Bizarrely, apart from Ben Dunne being top of the Haughey family wedding invitation list, McCracken found no evidence that Dunnes' companies received any favours from Haughey. 'Charlie would have had such a sense of noblesse oblige that he would think it was his entitlement. And he certainly would not have felt he was under an obligation. I suppose like Napoleon he went a bit barmy,' said his lover Keane. McCracken was not the end of Haughey's fall from grace; it was the beginning. McCracken was soon replaced by the Moriarty Tribunal tasked with trawling through his entire financial records. It discovered that businessmen keen for his favours invested tens of thousands of pounds in the Haughey family helicopter firm Celtic Helicopters. One such investor was Guy Snowden, the disgraced former American director of the national lottery firm Camelot, who lost his libel trial against Richard Branson over corruption allegations. As leader of Fianna Fail, Haughey also had control of the funds that the Irish state pays its political parties to help with staff and research costs. Money from that account, countersigned unknowingly by Bertie Ahern, ended up being used to pay his Charvet shirt bill, IR\u00a315, 000, and his bill, IR\u00a314,000, at Le Coq Hardi. An IR\u00a320,000 donation to the cancer fund of his seriously ill foreign minister Brian Lenihan, who received a liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic, ended up in the account of Celtic Helicopters. The new Ireland, a country of computer firms and the vibrant economically successful Celtic Tiger, was shocked and outraged at its hidden past of sleazy deals, bribery and Charles Haughey. The people turned. Instead of the saviour he was now the scoundrel of the nation. 'Haughey represents the corruption that ran through Irish society. He represents the centre of it all,' said Kevin Scally, a teacher who also queued to see Haughey in the witness box. Finally, even his mistress Terry Keane betrayed him by selling her story, and some highly embarrassing pictures of the couple kissing, to a Dublin newspaper in May 1999 for IR\u00a365,000 and auctioning off his old love tokens. To Haughey's fury, Keane also appeared on a popular Irish television chat show to expand on their relationship. Their 27-year relationship ended in a terse phone call the following day. 'Charlie didn't so much think that he would not get caught, he thought it would not matter if he did,' said Keane tartly. Like his hero Napoleon, Haughey, when he is not in the witness box, spends his final days in a gilded mansion, Abbeville, that has become his prison. He is deserted and alone, railing against his enemies and lamenting what could have been. Nothing will erase the ignominy, the shame, of his fall. It may be just, but it is a bitter end to an illustrious career. Even Charles Haughey might be forgiven for cursing that Florida police officer, far away across the Atlantic, who stopped Ben Dunne, and his secrets, from jumping from the Hyatt Regency's 17th floor balcony.",

After first arriving at the hotel in 1963, Viva (who went on to become an Andy Warhol superstar) gave birth to both Gaby and Alexander and married both her husbands during the 25 years she lived there. Leonard Cohen, however, preferred to write 'Chelsea Hotel No 2', a song commemorating fellatio with Janis Joplin in room 104, when he lived there in the 1970s. Patti Smith first stayed there in 1959, and in 1962-63 returned with a penurious Robert Mapplethorpe who could not persuade the owner Stanley Bard that his photography made an equitable exchange for rent. Stanley let them stay anyway. Joni Mitchell had 'Chelsea Morning'. BonJovi had 'Chelsea Midnight' and Nico and Andy Warhol had Chelsea Girls .</p> <p>Stanley Bard has been at the helm of the Chelsea Hotel for more than 40 years, since taking it over from his father David in 1957. The building was the first co-oped building in New York, having been built, complete with features such as artist studios, in 1882. It became a hotel in 1905, ended in bankruptcy, and rescued from the bank by a group led by David Bard in 1940. Now featuring 400 rooms, it has been the recent focus of morbid rumours of its imminent sale. It's not happening. What seems to have happened is that attention has been drawn to New York's Chelsea area in general as a result of the recent move there by so many art galleries, filling the blocks from 10th Ave and 24th St West to 11th Ave and 26th.</p> <p>In its relationship with the various art movements that flowed through New York, the hotel under Stanley's watchful eye, was always a noteworthy recipient of those fringe, and sometimes mainstay, figures that were active then. The list is long and fearsome, something like the opening verses of Genesis. It begins with Brendan Behan who needed to finish two books for Geiss and was allowed in on the proviso that there was 'no destruction of property'.</p> <p>He was followed by Dylan Thomas, whom Stanley remembers as being inebriated all the time (but then, 'they're all like that over there!'). The now legendary film-maker Harry Smith, who had been living in the hotel while contriving his Folklore Anthologies hung out with Allen Ginsberg, who then brought around Dylan and Cohen. Along with Aaron Copland, the most important American composer of his generation, Virgil Thompson lived in the most elegant of the rooms (a five-room apartment), until his death seven years ago. The wood appointments were my most vivid memories of that floor complete with a Steinway Grand and rich, dark wood surroundings.</p> <p>In 1967, I met the young designer Betsey Johnson in a long narrow room with a small bed at one end and Betsey's sewing machine at the other. Over a sleepless three days, she completed the costumes for Ciao Manhattan, and although they were the most disturbing costumes she had ever designed, she became instantly famous for her mini-skirt (simultaneously with Mary Quant in London) and Story of O dress.</p> <p>Another member of the Andy Warhol Factory, Danny Fields, held an Assassination Party on the Thanksgiving after JFK's assasination - to lift people out of their gloom. There he met Nico, a Teutonic vision of an ice-maiden, and introduced her to Warhol. He also took Leonard Cohen to visit Edie Sedgewick at the Chelsea. Edie was the daughter of an owner of the Southern Pacific Railroad who was introduced to AW by Barbara Rubin, a Lower East Side film-maker, whom she had met during a recent stay in a mental home. Barbara had taught her how to stay slim (throwing up after meals). Leonard left her room greatly concerned at the way her room seemed to overflow with candles in what looked to him like a foreboding vision of the future. He wasn't wrong. Edie was soon burnt out of the Chelsea and out of her apartment in separate incidents. It was at that time that I first saw her in the Factory, her arms heavily bandaged, which only served to accentuate her Jean Seberg-like fragility.</p> <p>If you were indigent and had a partying nature, then it was imperative you found a place to crash for the night, and if you didn't already have a room to go to, then you would surely know someone who knew someone who knew where the action was... and this was invariably at the Chelsea. This partying vortex echoed the same moveable feast one encountered at Andy Warhol's Factory, when Andy and Edie, the young poet and photographer Gerard Malanga, and Andy's 'discovery' Ingrid Superstar moved en masse around the Manhattan salons. It was the networking style of the day.</p> <p>I recall the days when they disappeared to 23rd St to shoot Chelsea Girls because the Factory was forlorn and empty, no silk screens stretched out on the floor, and more ominously no opera! Stanley remembers the soothing gloss Andy put on the filming of Chelsea Girls, seeking to persuade him of the positive effect it would have on the image of the hotel. Stanley would not have it. Still, he signed the release for Paul Morrissey and has never seen the movie to this day.</p> <p>Piero Heliczer as the link between the Factory and the Velvet Underground, and was already documenting the Lower East Side, when Paul Morrissey saw us play and offered to manage us. It was the beginning of a dizzying four years in which we went from total anonymity to great renown. A vertical path that proved too much for our centre of gravity. It gave each of us in the band the bends from which we never quite recovered. Although we tried to focus on the music, the tug of war between Andy's artworld panache and the more crude demands of rock'n'roll street life, never allowed for an amicable resolution.</p> <p>For one reason or another, I view this period, with its misplaced gaiety, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the people who helped the art get made. Misplaced in the sense that Vietnam was the backdrop and art was a versatile posture, arrogant and unforgiving of loss of life. Amphetamines are thirsty work: they were the viral bone-meal of creativity in the 60s.</p> <p>Stanley Bard is today the last of a line of art mavens who from the sidelines helped many a young artist in need who would otherwise have slipped through the net. He took what was handed him and rode with it. Stanley's philosophy of mentoring is down to earth. He viewed Andy as trustworthy: artistically... but not into the far ether. When he allowed Robert M to live there rent-free with Patti in 1962-63 he was persuaded by Mapplethorpe's conviction that he would have money very soon... but demurred when he saw what was offered, Robert's photo-prints of his dying friends.</p> <p>This kind of story happened frequently in those early days. A frequent figure at the Factory, Danny Fields took Nico to see a dentist (his uncle) who was offered a Warhol painting in lieu of his services, but who turned it down.</p> <p>The lobby of the hotel was so furry with art from its tenants that it has never fully moved away from being an overgrown taxidermist's Valhalla. The ghosts, the plaques, the fame, still ooze from the walls. Furry people, too. Werewolves of Chelsea. Limited always to the 2nd floor, where the cleaning staff entered with caution, eyes down for glass, peering through the door into the bath, the discipline of homicide detectives.</p> <p>Every nascent movement has its benefactors, detractors, hangers-on and champions. In New York, movements have a way of coalescing around people and locations with their own unique built-in level of difficulty. The stand-offishness of the personages would often mimic the centre of gravity of the activities. We see this in New York with the case of the Mudd Club and its covert owner Steve Maas, and in Mickey Ruskin in the case of Max's Kansas City. Each of these individuals played a visceral role in the activities of the day. In Stanley Bard's case (no less than the others'), he gave shelter to those in need of it while completing their work. It was as if you gained diplomatic immunity the moment you entered the lobby.</p> <p>This rings in one's ears when the story of Bill Graham and the opening of Filmore East is told. As well as wanting to open the San Francisco version of the hotel, since rockers were not welcome in any hotel in those days, he saw his friendship with Stanley as part of the solution as well as future commerce in the cloning of the Chelsea on the West coast. (Also there was Hilly, later at CBGB, who opened and developed a property on the Bowery where the derelict held court over the dissolute, and where musicians scampered in and out of the club heaving their heavy equipment under the doleful gaze of the street people hungry for knowledge of any spectacle beyond the gutter. Hilly, meanwhile, could, on any lazy afternoon, be found roaming the chairs and tables of the empty bar with his acoustic guitar singing his favourite Gilbert &amp; Sullivan songs in a rich, operatic baritone. The punk movement was not his only home from home.)</p> <p>All these years later, Max's has closed down, the Mudd Club has moved, but the Chelsea is still there, like a stately lady, slightly run down. Now I have mixed feelings about her. Although the aura of that icon of the 60s is still intact, for many of us those days had lustre but too much confusion. If only the delivery had been better... if only the song was in tune... if only the fame had lasted... if only the truth were known... if only the drugs were free... if only we hadn't lost the sight... if only the film was in focus... if only the money was in the bank... if only art would last forever...</p>",

Leonard Cohen, however, preferred to write 'Chelsea Hotel No 2', a song commemorating fellatio with Janis Joplin in room 104, when he lived there in the 1970s. Patti Smith first stayed there in 1959, and in 1962-63 returned with a penurious Robert Mapplethorpe who could not persuade the owner Stanley Bard that his photography made an equitable exchange for rent. Stanley let them stay anyway. Joni Mitchell had 'Chelsea Morning'. BonJovi had 'Chelsea Midnight' and Nico and Andy Warhol had Chelsea Girls . Stanley Bard has been at the helm of the Chelsea Hotel for more than 40 years, since taking it over from his father David in 1957. The building was the first co-oped building in New York, having been built, complete with features such as artist studios, in 1882. It became a hotel in 1905, ended in bankruptcy, and rescued from the bank by a group led by David Bard in 1940. Now featuring 400 rooms, it has been the recent focus of morbid rumours of its imminent sale. It's not happening. What seems to have happened is that attention has been drawn to New York's Chelsea area in general as a result of the recent move there by so many art galleries, filling the blocks from 10th Ave and 24th St West to 11th Ave and 26th. In its relationship with the various art movements that flowed through New York, the hotel under Stanley's watchful eye, was always a noteworthy recipient of those fringe, and sometimes mainstay, figures that were active then. The list is long and fearsome, something like the opening verses of Genesis. It begins with Brendan Behan who needed to finish two books for Geiss and was allowed in on the proviso that there was 'no destruction of property'. He was followed by Dylan Thomas, whom Stanley remembers as being inebriated all the time (but then, 'they're all like that over there!'). The now legendary film-maker Harry Smith, who had been living in the hotel while contriving his Folklore Anthologies hung out with Allen Ginsberg, who then brought around Dylan and Cohen. Along with Aaron Copland, the most important American composer of his generation, Virgil Thompson lived in the most elegant of the rooms (a five-room apartment), until his death seven years ago. The wood appointments were my most vivid memories of that floor complete with a Steinway Grand and rich, dark wood surroundings. In 1967, I met the young designer Betsey Johnson in a long narrow room with a small bed at one end and Betsey's sewing machine at the other. Over a sleepless three days, she completed the costumes for Ciao Manhattan, and although they were the most disturbing costumes she had ever designed, she became instantly famous for her mini-skirt (simultaneously with Mary Quant in London) and Story of O dress. Another member of the Andy Warhol Factory, Danny Fields, held an Assassination Party on the Thanksgiving after JFK's assasination - to lift people out of their gloom. There he met Nico, a Teutonic vision of an ice-maiden, and introduced her to Warhol. He also took Leonard Cohen to visit Edie Sedgewick at the Chelsea. Edie was the daughter of an owner of the Southern Pacific Railroad who was introduced to AW by Barbara Rubin, a Lower East Side film-maker, whom she had met during a recent stay in a mental home. Barbara had taught her how to stay slim (throwing up after meals). Leonard left her room greatly concerned at the way her room seemed to overflow with candles in what looked to him like a foreboding vision of the future. He wasn't wrong. Edie was soon burnt out of the Chelsea and out of her apartment in separate incidents. It was at that time that I first saw her in the Factory, her arms heavily bandaged, which only served to accentuate her Jean Seberg-like fragility. If you were indigent and had a partying nature, then it was imperative you found a place to crash for the night, and if you didn't already have a room to go to, then you would surely know someone who knew someone who knew where the action was... and this was invariably at the Chelsea. This partying vortex echoed the same moveable feast one encountered at Andy Warhol's Factory, when Andy and Edie, the young poet and photographer Gerard Malanga, and Andy's 'discovery' Ingrid Superstar moved en masse around the Manhattan salons. It was the networking style of the day. I recall the days when they disappeared to 23rd St to shoot Chelsea Girls because the Factory was forlorn and empty, no silk screens stretched out on the floor, and more ominously no opera! Stanley remembers the soothing gloss Andy put on the filming of Chelsea Girls, seeking to persuade him of the positive effect it would have on the image of the hotel. Stanley would not have it. Still, he signed the release for Paul Morrissey and has never seen the movie to this day. Piero Heliczer as the link between the Factory and the Velvet Underground, and was already documenting the Lower East Side, when Paul Morrissey saw us play and offered to manage us. It was the beginning of a dizzying four years in which we went from total anonymity to great renown. A vertical path that proved too much for our centre of gravity. It gave each of us in the band the bends from which we never quite recovered. Although we tried to focus on the music, the tug of war between Andy's artworld panache and the more crude demands of rock'n'roll street life, never allowed for an amicable resolution. For one reason or another, I view this period, with its misplaced gaiety, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the people who helped the art get made. Misplaced in the sense that Vietnam was the backdrop and art was a versatile posture, arrogant and unforgiving of loss of life. Amphetamines are thirsty work: they were the viral bone-meal of creativity in the 60s. Stanley Bard is today the last of a line of art mavens who from the sidelines helped many a young artist in need who would otherwise have slipped through the net. He took what was handed him and rode with it. Stanley's philosophy of mentoring is down to earth. He viewed Andy as trustworthy: artistically... but not into the far ether. When he allowed Robert M to live there rent-free with Patti in 1962-63 he was persuaded by Mapplethorpe's conviction that he would have money very soon... but demurred when he saw what was offered, Robert's photo-prints of his dying friends. This kind of story happened frequently in those early days. A frequent figure at the Factory, Danny Fields took Nico to see a dentist (his uncle) who was offered a Warhol painting in lieu of his services, but who turned it down. The lobby of the hotel was so furry with art from its tenants that it has never fully moved away from being an overgrown taxidermist's Valhalla. The ghosts, the plaques, the fame, still ooze from the walls. Furry people, too. Werewolves of Chelsea. Limited always to the 2nd floor, where the cleaning staff entered with caution, eyes down for glass, peering through the door into the bath, the discipline of homicide detectives. Every nascent movement has its benefactors, detractors, hangers-on and champions. In New York, movements have a way of coalescing around people and locations with their own unique built-in level of difficulty. The stand-offishness of the personages would often mimic the centre of gravity of the activities. We see this in New York with the case of the Mudd Club and its covert owner Steve Maas, and in Mickey Ruskin in the case of Max's Kansas City. Each of these individuals played a visceral role in the activities of the day. In Stanley Bard's case (no less than the others'), he gave shelter to those in need of it while completing their work. It was as if you gained diplomatic immunity the moment you entered the lobby. This rings in one's ears when the story of Bill Graham and the opening of Filmore East is told. As well as wanting to open the San Francisco version of the hotel, since rockers were not welcome in any hotel in those days, he saw his friendship with Stanley as part of the solution as well as future commerce in the cloning of the Chelsea on the West coast. (Also there was Hilly, later at CBGB, who opened and developed a property on the Bowery where the derelict held court over the dissolute, and where musicians scampered in and out of the club heaving their heavy equipment under the doleful gaze of the street people hungry for knowledge of any spectacle beyond the gutter. Hilly, meanwhile, could, on any lazy afternoon, be found roaming the chairs and tables of the empty bar with his acoustic guitar singing his favourite Gilbert &amp; Sullivan songs in a rich, operatic baritone. The punk movement was not his only home from home.) All these years later, Max's has closed down, the Mudd Club has moved, but the Chelsea is still there, like a stately lady, slightly run down. Now I have mixed feelings about her. Although the aura of that icon of the 60s is still intact, for many of us those days had lustre but too much confusion. If only the delivery had been better... if only the song was in tune... if only the fame had lasted... if only the truth were known... if only the drugs were free... if only we hadn't lost the sight... if only the film was in focus... if only the money was in the bank... if only art would last forever...",

      "body": "<p>Nell Gifford's bright eyes are blazing. She's painted her lids with greeny-blue greasepaint, and her lips are an exaggerated chalky pink. Her cheeks are full of colour. Her long, blonde, wavy hair is loose around her broad shoulders and she's dressed in a black, 30s cocktail dress. The curtains open, and she gallops out from the late summer evening darkness into the bright lights of the circus ring. She sits, straight-backed on Eclipse, her fine, young, black-and-white horse, and a little girl in the front row gasps. It's not just the close proximity of the horse's hooves kicking up sawdust and sand that makes the child's eyes open wide, but the sight of Nell herself. Her smile is dazzling. </p> <p>For the few short minutes that she rides Eclipse round the small ring, expertly controlling the pony's every step, the audience is mesmerised. The 27-year-old is everything a circus show-girl should be: glamorous, glittering, Amazonian, wild and wayward. It's the stuff of little girls' dreams. </p> <p>It's opening night of Gifford's Circus on a grassy field in Minety, a tiny village in Wiltshire. Chris the Clown has spent most of the day erecting the hand-operated children's merry-go-round; Gerald, the stage manager has been setting out seats. The Big Top - a plain, cream marquee with a string of bare bulbs decked around the outside - has been tightened up. Sophia and Edwina are in the wardrobe trailer, sewing on sequins, and ironing costumes. Iris, the blue-blooded, ex-model who got sick of her life in front of the camera, and joined the circus when it started last May, is idly drawing in her sketch book. And in her blue transit van, Shaena, the aerial artist, and her partner, Helen, are mending the runs in their flesh-coloured tights from their last performance in Cheltenham. </p> <p>The generators are running. The Portaloos are ready and the box office - a 30s-style, maroon-painted trailer - has been washed and given a polish. There are only 35 seats left to sell out of a full house of 150. Husband-and-wife team, Toti and Nell Gifford, have been busy since the early hours, taking bookings on the mobile, in between mucking out the circus's two horses, helping with banging in tent pegs and building rides. It's been non-stop, and it's just half-an-hour before the show begins. </p> <p>Minety is a special place for Nell. It's the village where she grew up after her family moved from Oxford when she was 10. And it's where her mother had a terrible riding accident that was to leave her in a coma, and turn Nell's life inside out. 'It's really emotional for us to come back,' she says. </p> <p>For almost 10 years, the circus has been in Nell's blood. She fell into it by chance, on her gap year before an English degree at Oxford. Traumatised by her mother's accident, she visited her brother-in-law, Gerald, who'd joined Circus Flora in America. It was not long before Nell caught the bug, too. </p> <p>Most circus people are born into life in the Big Top. Circus families are close knit, and while outsiders like Nell might dream of running away to the circus, there are those who are part of it by birth, who dream of running away from it. Outsiders who join are nicknamed jossers, and that is what Nell became after she graduated, first at Richie Richards' Mega Circus, touring the north-west of England, and then at the UK-touring, French circus, Santus, where she was promoted from a life of mucking out horses to the more glamorous position of ring mistress. </p> <p>Nell's stories of life as a circus girl are told in her book, Josser , published last year by Virago. After Santus, she got a job as a rider at the prestigious German circus, Roncalli, which is run by Billy Smart's granddaughter, Yasmin Smart. While she was working at Roncalli, Nell became engaged to Toti Gifford, a landscape architect with no previous interest in the circus. Inevitably, Toti also caught the bug. In May 1999, Toti and Nell were married and back in England. As a result of her book, she was invited to attend the Hay Literary Festival - with her own circus. She accepted and Gifford's Circus was born. </p> <p>The 22-strong circus includes a clown, two aerial artists from a circus school in Bristol, three dancing girls, a contortionist, a juggler, a couple of musicians, and a wardrobe mistress. Interested friends volunteered to pitch in, including the model Iris Palmer. 'Nell needed someone in wardrobe, so I volunteered to help,' says Iris, who is a cousin of fellow model-turned-student, Honor Fraser, and niece of Lord Glenconner. Her mother is a member of the eccentric Scottish Tennant dynasty. A few years ago, Iris was an international model, posing for fashion shoots in Vogue , and walking the catwalk every season. She's still on the books of her agency, Storm, where she was signed after being 'discovered' by Isabella Blow. But the 23-year-old has now moved away from her jet-set London life, back to a country house in Gloucestershire and has pretty much given up modelling, which she describes as 'fruitless'. </p> <p>The circus interests Iris far more than fashion. She joined Gifford's for the first leg of the tour. She liked the fact the circus involves art and skill, as well as total discipline. 'Me and Sophia did the wardrobe and the curtains for the first tour between us. It meant living the circus 24 hours a day, with no heating, or anything. We survived on good spirit.' Sophia, a freelance theatrical costume maker, designed the costumes and helps with the horses. Tonight, she is also a curtain girl. 'You don't really have any other life, once you're in the circus,' she says. </p> <p>Doing the curtains means literally opening and closing them for each act to enter or exit the ring. The curtain girls wear glittery, sequinned butterfly-appliqu\u00e9 tops, little skirts and fishnet tights. They have to smile throughout the performance. </p> <p>For the Cotswolds tour, Iris is taking a back seat, concentrating instead on her drawing. Nell wants her to put an act together for next season. 'I have to find out what I'm best at - I could be an acrobat, or a gymnast. My legs and arms are really strong. I tried comedy, but it was a bit close to the bone.' According to Gerald, 'She's a natural.' </p> <p>Gifford's has some of the poshest and most glamorous curtain girls in the business. For the Cotswolds season, it is the turn of another Storm model, Lydia M, to take responsibility for the curtain, alongside Edwina Belmont, whose sister, Lara, starred in Tim Roth's movie, War Zone . Lydia happens to be part of the Gifford family; she's married to Nell's brother. Whenever she has a gap in her modelling schedule, she travels to the circus to put on her fishnets and smile sweetly for the audience. Edwina, another of Isabella Blow's young prot\u00e9g\u00e9es, has also had a stint on Storm's books. She's still only 19, but already she's modelled, worked as the coat girl at the Soho club Gaz's Rockin' Blues, made hats with Philip Treacy and travelled the world. Now's she's joined the circus, although she eventually hopes to get a place at Central Saint Martin's in London to do fashion. Edwina has taken over Iris's job for the six-week season. She sleeps in a small tent at the back of the Big Top. 'It's such a romantic idea... the costumes and the fantasy. Now I think I want to work as a cowgirl in Texas.' And no doubt she will. </p> <p>After the show, the audience hang around in the darkness of the field, the children pulling their parents' arms to go backstage and see the horses, and the little girls asking Helen and Shaena how they can stroke their arms with the flaming torches without getting burnt. The truth is, on close inspection, their arms have patches of hard skin and all the hairs have been torched off. </p> <p>It was almost a full house and the artists are on a high. Everyone piles down to the pub, desperately hoping that they serve food after 10pm. Nell's eyes, still smudged with theatrical make-up, are bloodshot. She looks exhausted, but she's happy. There's nothing like a big audience to boost morale. </p> <p>Gifford's is a traditional, 30s, village green circus. There's nothing grand about it. It doesn't have the fabulous airs and graces of Circus Roncalli, or the tacky commercialism that has come to typify English circus. 'We've put everything we have into it,' says Nell. 'We could have a comfortable house, nice clothes, three holidays a year.' Instead, they have a 20ft trailer with a gas cooker, a clapped-out leather sofa, and a bed at the back. In order to survive, they rely on Toti's income from his landscape business. </p> <p>Later, back at her caravan, Nell kicks off her cowboy boots and falls into bed. She has to be up at seven, to muck out the horses, feed the animals, organise the next day's parade through a nearby town to drum up publicity. To survive, the circus must keep on moving and keep on selling itself. On a nearby farm, the cockerels begin to crow. A new day dawns and it's showtime all over again.</p> <p>\u0095 Gifford's Circus is touring the Cotswolds until 17 September. For more information, call 07818 058 384</p>",

At the top of the stairs there's a picture of Tom Fool, who was the jester here in the 1500s and who used to sit under a tree and direct lost travellers into the quicksand and eventually chopped the carpenter's head off, which in those days passed for having a well-developed sense of humour. Needless to say, he soon came to the attention of William Shakespeare, who couldn't stop laughing and by all accounts used him as the model for the Fool in King Lear .

Boasting aside, it was encouraging to learn that the tangible excitement I could feel all around me in the Royal Albert Hall in the final movement taken at reckless, breakneck and indescribably exhilarating speed by Bernard Haitink and the Berlin Philharmonic was just as apparent to radio listeners. No question, you could feel the tension in the auditorium, they all agreed. Someone suggested that you could probably feel it more acutely because you weren't distracted by the players, the lights and the bald man two boxes along in the Grand Tier doing the Evening Standard crossword.

      "trailText": "<p>Say hello Slipknot and Limp Bizkit. After a momentous week in rock history, America's 'nu metal' bands have the world at their feet.</p>",
      "byline": "Sam Taylor",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was a watershed week in the history of rock. A week when the old British establishment was toppled and a new wave of American bands took over. A week when the generational divide was reasserted, and teen-pop duo Daphne and Celeste were pelted with bottles full of urine. A week when Britt Ekland slipped on a melon and broke her ankle. It was that kind of week. Nothing will ever be the same again. </p> <p>It started last weekend, when the Reading and Leeds festivals, though headlined by Oasis, Stereophonics and Pulp, were dominated by the sound of nu metal: hordes of kids in baggy shorts moshed to Slipknot and Limp Bizkit and booed every mention of Oasis's name. One merchandise salesman revealed that, on Monday in Leeds, he had sold 14 Oasis T-shirts and 2,500 Slipknot T-shirts. The covers of both NME and Melody Maker featured Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit singing to a sea of faces at Reading. According to Wednesday's Independent, this was 'the night the Nineties ended'. </p> <p>On Tuesday, day zero of the new era, I went to the annual awards ceremony for Kerrang! magazine - until recently an anachronistic heavy rock magazine, now the bible of the nu-metal scene and the only music magazine in Britain with rising sales figures. The magazine's editor Paul Rees hailed 'a remarkable year for rock music'. Slipknot collected three awards, each time smashing up their chairs and tossing microphone stands from the stage. An hour later, Britt Ekland had her unfortunate accident, having to be carried up on to the stage in order to present an honorary award to Marilyn Manson, last year's scariest man in the world, who praised Slipknot for their 'honesty' and mused about being 'over the hill'. </p> <p>It was a bizarre evening, but the sense of being on the right side of a coup d'\u00e9tat was unmistakable. The Kerrang! Creativity Award, for example, went to Ross Robinson, the man who discovered and produced many of the bands at the heart of this new wave - including Slipknot - and who has just been given his own international record label by Virgin. With his bright white sneakers and clean-cut face, this 33-year-old Californian looks an unlikely revolutionary, but he talks the talk. In a booth at the Hammersmith Palais, while a succession of people come over to slap his back, Robinson explains the spirit that unites this new wave of rock bands: 'Passion and hunger,' he says. 'Absolute hunger. It's not about getting chicks or making money or any of that crap. It's about being pure and real, beautiful and extreme.' </p> <p>As with punk in the Seventies, the movement is spearheaded by two bands with markedly different agendas - Limp Bizkit, the Clash-like poster boys, and Slipknot, the Sex Pistols of their generation: mask-wearing nihilists who hate everything. </p> <p>Following in their slipstream are a legion of American bands, including established, million-selling acts like Korn, Kid Rock, Deftones and Rage Against the Machine, and newer bands such as Amen, Glass Jaw and At The Drive-In. </p> <p>Whatever you want to call this movement - nu metal, sports metal, adidas rock -it has its roots in the fusion of hard rock and hardcore rap. The bands are all white, as are most of their fans, but they revere and borrow from the musical and fashion stylings of black hip-hop culture, creating a massive new subculture which is energetic but nihilistic, angst-ridden but with the beats and riffs to get a frat party going. </p> <p>All these bands know each other, but they are not exactly friends. In the space of three days, I hear Slipknot diss Limp Bizkit, Marilyn Manson diss Limp Bizkit, and Limp Bizkit diss Slipknot and Marilyn Manson. As Fred Durst yells on Limp Bizkit's recent Top 3 single, 'Take A Look Around' (the theme to Mission Impossible 2 ), 'hate is all the world has seen lately'. </p> <p>To anyone over the age of 20, there is something comical about all this. I have seen few things funnier than Slipknot's unease at the Kerrang! Awards. 'We don't know how to feel about this,' one of the masked figures confessed gruffly as he clutched the Best International Live Act gong. 'It's way too formal and we're a band that likes to puke on each other and beat each other up.' Ten minutes later, pronounced Best Band in the World, they throw a table full of drinks to the floor, dedicate the award to 'my grandmother', then stand meekly in line to collect their gold discs. The ghost of Spinal Tap hovers in the background. </p> <p>But the fact that it's all been done before doesn't make this phenomenon any less meaningful. This is the sound of a generation - or at least of the half of a generation that isn't E'd off its collective head at the local club. Ecstasy and agony, it seems, are the only popular cultural options available to the modern teenager. </p> <p>Twenty-four hours later, in a Parisian boardroom, angst is still in the air as Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst and Wes Borland answer questions from the European press about Woodstock (the band were blamed by some people for the rioting and arson that took place at last year's festival), the title of their forthcoming album ( Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog-Coloured Water - it's lavatorial humour; 'the most stupid title we could think of'), and why they think everyone hates them. 'It is just marketing, yes?' probes one French journalist. Durst and Borland are articulate and dry-witted, but their message is familiar and deadly earnest. 'I'm not drinking alcohol and popping pills and taking heroin and fucking chicks all day,' says Durst, who is 26, gruffly good-looking and permanently baseball-capped. </p> <p>He is, rather, trying to express his feelings about the screwed-up nature of the world, and by extension the feelings of 'his' generation (albeit most of his generation are roughly half his age). The chorus to the band's new single, 'My Generation', goes: 'How can we give a fuck about anyone else if they don't give a fuck about us?' Outside on the street, hundreds of French skate-kids send up chants of approval. </p> <p>Like Slipknot, Korn and others, Limp Bizkit's main, abiding concern is for their fans. They are in the vanguard of bands using the internet to their advantage - their latest free-entry tour of the US was sponsored by Napster - and, in contrast to the rather high-minded, artistic ways of earlier rock bands, Limp Bizkit regard themselves as their fans' servants, much as boy-bands profess to do. 'We would never have a sudden change of musical direction and leave our fans behind,' Durst swears. 'Our new album is like the first two, only more so. If you like Limp Bizkit, you'll love the new album. If you don't like us, you'll hate it.' </p> <p>By 9pm a generation is sweating out its anxieties in a seething, sweltering, 2,000-capacity venue. All bare-chested boys and nose-ringed girls, the Parisian audience is in its late teens and knows every word to every noxious American rap ('Everything is fucked, everybody sucks... your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!'). At heart, though, Limp Bizkit are a powerful, theatrical rock band - entertainers who cover George Michael's 'Faith' and use fireworks, glitter confetti and jets of flame to give things a lift. Next March's European tour will, they promise, be a production '10 times bigger than anything seen in the last few years'. Afterwards the reviewer from Kerrang! sniffs something disdainful about 'metal cabaret'. </p> <p>As Durst well knows, mass success brings with it the seeds of destruction, particularly for bands as desperately, self-consciously 'real' as Limp Bizkit and Slipknot. At the Kerrang! Awards, Ross Robinson muttered darkly about nu metal already being 'about to die'. In the Paris press conference, Durst imagines, a few years down the line, that 'everyone will be like: \"Limp Bizkit? They suck, man!\" The best any band can hope for is to be a little moment in history.' </p> <p>Fasten your seatbelts, dudes.

      "bodyText": "It was a watershed week in the history of rock. A week when the old British establishment was toppled and a new wave of American bands took over. A week when the generational divide was reasserted, and teen-pop duo Daphne and Celeste were pelted with bottles full of urine. A week when Britt Ekland slipped on a melon and broke her ankle. It was that kind of week. Nothing will ever be the same again. It started last weekend, when the Reading and Leeds festivals, though headlined by Oasis, Stereophonics and Pulp, were dominated by the sound of nu metal: hordes of kids in baggy shorts moshed to Slipknot and Limp Bizkit and booed every mention of Oasis's name. One merchandise salesman revealed that, on Monday in Leeds, he had sold 14 Oasis T-shirts and 2,500 Slipknot T-shirts. The covers of both NME and Melody Maker featured Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit singing to a sea of faces at Reading. According to Wednesday's Independent, this was 'the night the Nineties ended'. On Tuesday, day zero of the new era, I went to the annual awards ceremony for Kerrang! magazine - until recently an anachronistic heavy rock magazine, now the bible of the nu-metal scene and the only music magazine in Britain with rising sales figures. The magazine's editor Paul Rees hailed 'a remarkable year for rock music'. Slipknot collected three awards, each time smashing up their chairs and tossing microphone stands from the stage. An hour later, Britt Ekland had her unfortunate accident, having to be carried up on to the stage in order to present an honorary award to Marilyn Manson, last year's scariest man in the world, who praised Slipknot for their 'honesty' and mused about being 'over the hill'. It was a bizarre evening, but the sense of being on the right side of a coup d'\u00e9tat was unmistakable. The Kerrang! Creativity Award, for example, went to Ross Robinson, the man who discovered and produced many of the bands at the heart of this new wave - including Slipknot - and who has just been given his own international record label by Virgin. With his bright white sneakers and clean-cut face, this 33-year-old Californian looks an unlikely revolutionary, but he talks the talk. In a booth at the Hammersmith Palais, while a succession of people come over to slap his back, Robinson explains the spirit that unites this new wave of rock bands: 'Passion and hunger,' he says. 'Absolute hunger. It's not about getting chicks or making money or any of that crap. It's about being pure and real, beautiful and extreme.' As with punk in the Seventies, the movement is spearheaded by two bands with markedly different agendas - Limp Bizkit, the Clash-like poster boys, and Slipknot, the Sex Pistols of their generation: mask-wearing nihilists who hate everything. Following in their slipstream are a legion of American bands, including established, million-selling acts like Korn, Kid Rock, Deftones and Rage Against the Machine, and newer bands such as Amen, Glass Jaw and At The Drive-In. Whatever you want to call this movement - nu metal, sports metal, adidas rock -it has its roots in the fusion of hard rock and hardcore rap. The bands are all white, as are most of their fans, but they revere and borrow from the musical and fashion stylings of black hip-hop culture, creating a massive new subculture which is energetic but nihilistic, angst-ridden but with the beats and riffs to get a frat party going. All these bands know each other, but they are not exactly friends. In the space of three days, I hear Slipknot diss Limp Bizkit, Marilyn Manson diss Limp Bizkit, and Limp Bizkit diss Slipknot and Marilyn Manson. As Fred Durst yells on Limp Bizkit's recent Top 3 single, 'Take A Look Around' (the theme to Mission Impossible 2 ), 'hate is all the world has seen lately'. To anyone over the age of 20, there is something comical about all this. I have seen few things funnier than Slipknot's unease at the Kerrang! Awards. 'We don't know how to feel about this,' one of the masked figures confessed gruffly as he clutched the Best International Live Act gong. 'It's way too formal and we're a band that likes to puke on each other and beat each other up.' Ten minutes later, pronounced Best Band in the World, they throw a table full of drinks to the floor, dedicate the award to 'my grandmother', then stand meekly in line to collect their gold discs. The ghost of Spinal Tap hovers in the background. But the fact that it's all been done before doesn't make this phenomenon any less meaningful. This is the sound of a generation - or at least of the half of a generation that isn't E'd off its collective head at the local club. Ecstasy and agony, it seems, are the only popular cultural options available to the modern teenager. Twenty-four hours later, in a Parisian boardroom, angst is still in the air as Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst and Wes Borland answer questions from the European press about Woodstock (the band were blamed by some people for the rioting and arson that took place at last year's festival), the title of their forthcoming album ( Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog-Coloured Water - it's lavatorial humour; 'the most stupid title we could think of'), and why they think everyone hates them. 'It is just marketing, yes?' probes one French journalist. Durst and Borland are articulate and dry-witted, but their message is familiar and deadly earnest. 'I'm not drinking alcohol and popping pills and taking heroin and fucking chicks all day,' says Durst, who is 26, gruffly good-looking and permanently baseball-capped. He is, rather, trying to express his feelings about the screwed-up nature of the world, and by extension the feelings of 'his' generation (albeit most of his generation are roughly half his age). The chorus to the band's new single, 'My Generation', goes: 'How can we give a fuck about anyone else if they don't give a fuck about us?' Outside on the street, hundreds of French skate-kids send up chants of approval. Like Slipknot, Korn and others, Limp Bizkit's main, abiding concern is for their fans. They are in the vanguard of bands using the internet to their advantage - their latest free-entry tour of the US was sponsored by Napster - and, in contrast to the rather high-minded, artistic ways of earlier rock bands, Limp Bizkit regard themselves as their fans' servants, much as boy-bands profess to do. 'We would never have a sudden change of musical direction and leave our fans behind,' Durst swears. 'Our new album is like the first two, only more so. If you like Limp Bizkit, you'll love the new album. If you don't like us, you'll hate it.' By 9pm a generation is sweating out its anxieties in a seething, sweltering, 2,000-capacity venue. All bare-chested boys and nose-ringed girls, the Parisian audience is in its late teens and knows every word to every noxious American rap ('Everything is fucked, everybody sucks... your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker!'). At heart, though, Limp Bizkit are a powerful, theatrical rock band - entertainers who cover George Michael's 'Faith' and use fireworks, glitter confetti and jets of flame to give things a lift. Next March's European tour will, they promise, be a production '10 times bigger than anything seen in the last few years'. Afterwards the reviewer from Kerrang! sniffs something disdainful about 'metal cabaret'. As Durst well knows, mass success brings with it the seeds of destruction, particularly for bands as desperately, self-consciously 'real' as Limp Bizkit and Slipknot. At the Kerrang! Awards, Ross Robinson muttered darkly about nu metal already being 'about to die'. In the Paris press conference, Durst imagines, a few years down the line, that 'everyone will be like: \"Limp Bizkit? They suck, man!\" The best any band can hope for is to be a little moment in history.' Fasten your seatbelts, dudes. This is your moment. The beginner's guide to Nu Metal The bands Limp Bizkit. Slipknot. Korn. Rage Against the Machine. Deftones. Amen. Static-X. System of a Down. At the Drive-In. Snot. Orgy.

The tax office obviously knows she is still working, so I am at a loss to know why this was done. SC, South Molton The Revenue admits that saying the file was closed was a bad choice of words. It really meant that she does not have to complete a tax return this year. At retirement age, finances usually change so the taxman might send out returns for about three years to monitor the new pattern. The Revenue has presumably decided that your wife's tax position is stable. When she eventually retires, the tax returns will probably start arriving again. Action on complaints: Protests do pay off Lots of people won't think of enlisting your help when they have a problem with a large institution, and have to lump it. I envisage institutions having one in-tray for 'suckers' and another for 'disputers'. How many special cases that you bring to a company's attention does it take before they become more reasonable? FU, Ledbury Often institutions say they will correct mistakes immediately when these are procedural errors, such as computer blips that fail to send reminder letters. Occasionally they admit to inadequate staff training if branches are caught giving out wrong information, and someone is 'spoken to'. But mostly they maintain that complicated problems are caused by unusual circumstances, and admit only that their service has 'on this rare occasion' fallen below the 'usual high standard'. Letters of apology and complaint-handling have improved vastly in the past few years. But saying that service will be better is not the same as actually treating customers more thoughtfully. Companies need constant reminders that their customers are prepared to complain, through the newspaper if necessary. \u0095 Write to Margaret Dibben, Money Writes, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, and include a telephone number.

      "body": "<p>If you've never had cystitis, you probably won't be able to comprehend just how excruciatingly painful, draining and debilitating it can be. Caused by an infection of the bladder or urinary tract (when it can also be called urethritis), the initial burning sensation experienced when passing water can quickly escalate into a deeply sickening pain. This happened to me last week when I was unable to tackle the problem straightaway, business having taken me on a long train journey. Because it can develop into a far more serious kidney infection, cystitis needs to be knocked on the head quickly. </p> <p>Women seem to be the major targets of such culprit bacteria as E coli (which in this case is not the same type as the deadly superbug that infects meat), but cystitis also affects men and children, and may even be a cause of bedwetting. Although it usually lives on the outside of our bodies, E coli sometimes finds its way into our waterworks, thereby precipitating an attack of cystitis. There are other causes of cystitis, too: university health centres may find their waiting rooms full of cystitis-stricken students on Monday mornings, for example, a phenomenon that is usually due to too much boisterous sex. </p> <p>Treat your bladder and kidneys as you would your home's cold-water system and keep water flowing through your body so its 'pipes' remain in good condition and bug-free. Drinking plenty of water every day (2.5 litres for adults and about half this amount for children) will help to keep cystitis at bay. Another way to avoid a bladder infection is to empty your bladder before and after sex. Children, as well as adults, should also get into the habit of urinating regularly, rather than waiting until the last minute before going to the loo, as this helps to flush bacteria out of the body. Wearing cotton underwear instead of man-made alternatives is another good preventative measure, as cotton allows the skin to breathe and discourages the growth of bacteria. In addition, because bubble bath and bath salts can disturb the body's natural bacterial balance, if you're susceptible to bladder infections, bathe in plain water and use an unscented soap. </p> <p>Speed is of the essence in banishing cystitis, so keep this article handy in case you ever need an emergency action plan. There are two steps you should take as soon as you feel the dreaded symptoms. First, drink plenty of water and avoid tea and coffee, both of which can irritate the bladder. Before urinating, it is important that you drink so much water that you feel you have reached bursting point, and that you keep doing so. The more water you flush through your body, the less able the bugs will be to maintain their infective positions - don't overdo it, though: more than four to five litres a day can start interfering with your body's biochemistry. </p> <p>Secondly, blast the bugs with an acid attack: E coli and other cystitis-causing bacteria hate acidic environments, so consume as many acidic foods as you can. Cranberries head the list, ideally in the form of unsweetened juice, either 'neat' or mixed with freshly squeezed orange juice. You could also nibble on dried cranberries or add them to breakfast cereals or yogurt. Mixing cranberry and orange juice gives your body an additional dose of ascorbic acid, or vitamin C, which can be very efficient at banishing bladder infections. Vitamin C is found in other citrus fruits, along with green, leafy vegetables, kiwi fruits, blackcurrants, plums, blueberries, melons and mangoes. Aim to eat some vitamin C-rich fruit every few hours - perhaps an orange, a quarter of a melon or a small bowl of berries - to stop the bacteria from wreaking more damage. </p> <p>Protein-packed foods, such as eggs, fish, lean meat and poultry, can also increase the acidity level of your urine, so base your lunch and supper around these foods. You can still eat carbohydrates (such as bread, rice, pasta and potatoes), but it is important that you prioritise the protein. And although you may believe that because some wines are quite acidic, they are beneficial, most cystitis sufferers feel better if they avoid all alcohol until their symptoms have disappeared. This is because alcohol can cause your moods and energy levels to crash, which is the last thing you need if you are feeling unwell. You could, however, consider taking an echinacea supplement - medicinal herbalists recommend 500mg of powdered-root capsules or 15 drops of tincture - to boost your immune system. </p> <p>If you put these strategies into action as soon as cystitis rears its ugly head, the likelihood is that you will be able to head off the attack without medication. If the symptoms do not improve within a day or two, however, consult your GP, as you may need to take antibiotics. If so, be sure to complete the prescribed course, even if you start to feel better before you're due to finish it. If you stop prematurely, you could risk exposing your body to another infection or could compromise the effectiveness of any antibiotics you may take in the future. If the antibiotics make you feel sick, you may find that eating a small snack regularly, rather than a large meal, eases your nausea. Ginger tea is also a good nausea-reliever - you can make it by infusing some peeled fresh root ginger in boiling water for a few minutes. As soon as you finish the course, try to replenish your body's natural bacterial balance by including some 'good' bacteria in your diet - eat a small pot of live yogurt containing acidophilus or bifidus every day (don't heat it, as this will kill the beneficial bacteria) or take acidophilus or bifidus tablets (available from health-food shops). </p> <p>I bet you didn't know that eating fruit and live yogurt after sex had so much more to offer than mere organoleptic appeal!</p>",

His parents ran a newsagent's shop at the RAF station at Linton-on-Ouse near York, and Mike went to work there straight from school. He had no qualifications: 'I was not at all academic at school,' he says. 'I just played a lot of sport.' </p> <p>But, when he was 24, his parents sold up and retired. Mike had to make a choice: 'I had to decide whether to buy the store from them and continue running it or do something on my own.' </p> <p>He decided to go back to education. 'I have done the right thing, but it was very topsy-turvy financially. I was used to having a car, going out and buying clothes, but as a student I was not even eligible for a grant.' </p> <p>He took an access course and started a medical degree at Liverpool University but switched after two years to a sports science course; last year he did a master's degree at Chester. He is now in his second year teaching A-level sports psychology at Seevic Sixth Form College in Southend, Essex. </p> <p>He had paid his way at Liverpool with various part-time jobs, including a spell as receptionist in a sports centre, and avoided a student loan. But, to afford his living expenses at Chester, he had to take a \u00a32,500 graduate careers development loan from the HSBC bank. He is paying it back at \u00a357 a month until 2005, but is unhappy that the bank persuaded him to delay payments for a year, which has cost him an extra \u00a3200 in interest. </p> <p>'It was naivete on my part but the bank and I never actually worked out how much the interest would be over that year. I had no idea it would be that much and I am disappointed. If I had known, I would have repaid the loan straight away.' </p> <p>His only other debt is a car loan costing\u00a3150 a month over three years. </p> <p>He now rents a house with three others from the college but would like to buy eventually, although he cannot decide between getting a house on his own or investing in a larger property and renting out space. 'There are always new teachers living near the college who are looking for rooms.' </p> <p>He will start thinking about buying this time next year, by which time he might have decided whether to stay in southern England or move back north, where property is cheaper. He has about \u00a3250 a month spare spending money, which he leaves in his savings account or HSBC current account. 'I help myself to money when I need it.' </p> <p>He pays \u00a378 a month to the Teachers' Pension Scheme and wants to use his spare money to increase his pension contributions and start saving.</p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Ian Millward</strong></p> <p>Mike could transfer the \u00a3250 a month he pays in rent into a mortgage and, on his current salary, he could borrow up to \u00a360,000. A repayment loan would cost about \u00a3450 a month. He could rent out one room for up to \u00a34,250 a year tax-free under the Inland Revenue's Rent-a-Room scheme but, to borrow enough for a larger house, he needs to assure a lender that he will be able to find a lodger easily. He should think about increasing contributions to his Teachers' Pension through additional voluntary contributions (AVCs). The Teachers' AVC scheme is run by the Prudential, which is the most cost-effective route. On his current salary he can contribute no more than \u00a3212.50 gross a month to pensions but, as pension contributions are locked away until retirement, it is important to have other savings as well. </p> <p>He could buy an individual savings account. Depending on how much risk he wants to take, he can choose either a mini cash Isa or a stocks and shares Isa where his capital can fall as well as rise and which should be held for at least five years.</p> <p>He should also think about protection. His Teachers' Pension scheme pays out twice his salary on his death and this is sufficient while he is single and without dependents.

An interest-only mortgage will cost \u00a3350 a month. Of course he also needs to start saving, perhaps in an Isa, to repay the loan. </p> <p>With the \u00a3100 he should have left each month, I urge him to save something in a deposit account so that he has a proper emergency fund. I also suggest he invest in an Isa, such as the Fidelity Managed International Isa, which has flexibility and should give some capital growth.</p> <p>He may consider making additional voluntary contributions to his pension, or possibly buying added years. If the normal retirement age is 60, and he has been teaching for two years, he can get only 29 years of service and could buy back a further 11 years. I suggest he does this later on rather than commit himself now while his finances are quite tight. In any event, there is an argument that Isas would be better than pension schemes while annuity rates provide relatively small pensions.</p> <p>I would like to see Mike protect his income against accident, sickness or disability because clearly his whole financial future is at risk if he cannot earn any money.

Scholars, connoisseurs and the crack detectives of the Rembrandt Research Project had been looking hard at the picture, a grave and tender study of blindness. Maybe there were a few details by the master - some ivy, a little fur, those sightless eyes - but after due deliberation, they decided it was by another artist. The gallery took the drastic but conscientious step of changing the label. Anna and the Blind Tobit was now painted by Gerrit Dou. </p> <p>A few years later, after some judicious cleaning, the painting is a Rembrandt once more. Nothing has changed, least of all Dou's reputation, which hasn't been dredged from the ocean floor in over a century. There are those who believe Dou also painted The Man with the Golden Helmet, one of Rembrandt's most spectacular pictures. Yet even this extravagant claim hasn't burnished his former glory. You can buy a Dou for a relative pittance these days and practically nobody remembers his name. </p> <p>Gerrit Dou is the incredible shrinking master. Once he was a colossus - 'unequalled in the Netherlands', wrote one contemporary connoisseur, 'and even in all other countries.' Now he has dwindled to a foot note. Not for nothing is the show that opens at Dulwich next week subtitled 'Rembrandt's First Pupil' - how else to promote this long-forgotten artist? </p> <p>In the seventeenth century, the Golden Age of Dutch painting, Dou was bigger than Hals, more famous than Vermeer, massively richer than Rembrandt. The smallest of his pictures - and they are very small - could cost as much as a house. Cosimo de Medici traipsed across Europe to buy one, the Queen of Sweden was an avid collector. If Dou hadn't been such a prudent burgher, he could have become, like Van Dyke, a star at the English court. Instead he died a florin millionaire without once leaving his native Leiden. </p> <p>Nobody travels far in Dou's art, which is resolutely stop-at-home. He paints neat, calm, well-swept rooms, generally lit by a window on the left, otherwise by candle or firelight. His figures sit tight indoors, reading, writing, smoking or dozing, peeling the occasional apple. Sometimes he frames the room within the picture, drawing back a painted curtain to reveal the scenario. Sometimes the figures lean towards you across a high-illusion sill, holding a violin or a paintbrush and palette. With very few exceptions, the nearest Dou gets to the great outdoors is a housewife watering a window box. </p> <p>His gift is for small-scale detail, reality in perfect miniature. Get up close to these pictures - or as close as the barriers at Dulwich allow - and you see the intimate interiors of seventeenth-century Leiden summarised in little more than eight or nine inches. A hazy mirror, a vial of liquid, the darn in a Persian rug: Dou could paint a broomstick no bigger than a fingernail, moreover, without leaving any trace of his brush. This was no small miracle two centuries before the first photograph. </p> <p>Dou was the best of Holland's fijnschilders - fine painters - and he worked with the finest materials, three-hair brushes, colours ground on glass, wood instead of canvas which had too much give for his high-finish look. It is said that he waited for every last speck of dust to settle in the studio before selecting a brush. A German visitor claimed that Dou's sitters look intensely bored because the artist took five days to underpaint a single hand. This is hyperbole - Dou's portraits can be lively, quick with observation. But he is known to have charged by the hour. </p> <p>Set against this amazing all-over detail, however, is the complete lack of any central incident in Dou's paintings. Other than a few textbook genre scenes - doctors paying house visits, quacks selling snake oil to provincial dupes - literally nothing happens. There is no back story, no implicit future, no mystery to his subjects. </p> <p>Dou is no sort of Vermeer. He doesn't have a particle of Rembrandt's genius for psychology or emotion. No surprise, then, that he began to shrink in the age of red-hot Romanticism. He was barely 15 when he became Rembrandt's first pupil and his early work is a visual record of the experience. He paints Rembrandt's parents, Rembrandt's props, Rembrandt's subject matter, himself as a tiny Rembrandt with brushes and beret. But where Rembrandt's old woman reading a bible is deeply absorbed in the spiritual revelations of the book, Dou's is simply scanning the words. She is no more than her dutiful action. </p> <p>The curious thing about this painting, unusually big for Dou, is that the bible is larger than life yet the words on the open page are an unreadable blur. Dou's famous sense of scale can be oddly unstable. His trompe-l'oeil still lifes of books, globes and other scholarly paraphernalia are much too small to work, since trompe l'oeil has to be scrupulously life-size. The faces in his seven-inch portraits will be brilliantly realised, but then he'll mismatch them with bodies so tiny they look like children's toys. </p> <p>Perversely, Dou's talent often comes across better in blown-up reproductions, when all the attributes of his extraordinary skill are apparent to the last candle flicker, droplet and iota of dust. At their best, his details can be really startling - the submerged and eerie world inside a pickled shellfish jar, a blue-black cabbage leaf gleaming like a peacock feather, an hourglass glinting in the midnight shadows. Small pleasures, maybe, but one wouldn't wish to understate them with absurd claims that Dou could ever have painted a single one of the Rembrandts in the National Gallery.</p>",

As a programme note reminds us, he was heckled at a concert in 1931, prompting his friend the composer Charles Ives to respond: 'You goddam sissy! When you hear strong masculine music like this, get up and use your ears like a man!' (i.e. Say not the Ruggles Naught Availeth).

Trying to define her particular qualities, especially a work in which piano and orchestra are evenly matched rather than in gladiatorial combat, is no easy task. Muscularity combined with complete musical and physical control and extraordinary fluidity is about half the story. Her reputation adds to the excitement of her performances, allowing occasional smudges to pass almost unnoticed while for a lesser artist they would matter - such is the unfairness of stardom. She was called back at least five times by a preparedly ecstatic audience. </p> <p>A brief, belated word of praise for <b> Dorset Opera</b>, a well-established semi-professional company which had the initiative to raise Salvator Rosa, if not from the dead, at least from a very deep sleep. The cue for its revival was this year's 'Brazil 500' festival in celebration of that country's half-millennial anniversary. Carlos Gomes (1836-1896) studied in Rio de Janeiro but spent most of his life in Italy, absorbing the grand operatic styles of Rossini, Donizetti and Verdi. Had Puccini not arrived on the scene and eclipsed this real but lesser talent, Gomes might have remained known today. His four-act opera, based on the life of the seventeenth-century Italian painter, bursts with conflict and bloodshed, grand choruses and pulsating melodies, reminiscent of middle-period Verdi. Dorset Opera, performing in high style on the enchanting, if tiny, stage of Sherborne School, made it enthralling. The very name Dorset conjures up a sleepy rurality: all the more rewarding then to encounter such musical excitement.</p>",

Trying to define her particular qualities, especially a work in which piano and orchestra are evenly matched rather than in gladiatorial combat, is no easy task. Muscularity combined with complete musical and physical control and extraordinary fluidity is about half the story. Her reputation adds to the excitement of her performances, allowing occasional smudges to pass almost unnoticed while for a lesser artist they would matter - such is the unfairness of stardom. She was called back at least five times by a preparedly ecstatic audience. A brief, belated word of praise for Dorset Opera, a well-established semi-professional company which had the initiative to raise Salvator Rosa, if not from the dead, at least from a very deep sleep. The cue for its revival was this year's 'Brazil 500' festival in celebration of that country's half-millennial anniversary. Carlos Gomes (1836-1896) studied in Rio de Janeiro but spent most of his life in Italy, absorbing the grand operatic styles of Rossini, Donizetti and Verdi. Had Puccini not arrived on the scene and eclipsed this real but lesser talent, Gomes might have remained known today. His four-act opera, based on the life of the seventeenth-century Italian painter, bursts with conflict and bloodshed, grand choruses and pulsating melodies, reminiscent of middle-period Verdi. Dorset Opera, performing in high style on the enchanting, if tiny, stage of Sherborne School, made it enthralling. The very name Dorset conjures up a sleepy rurality: all the more rewarding then to encounter such musical excitement.",

Where does money come from: a class for young primary school children The class can be taught to see the difference between regular and unpredictable sources of money by being asked to name and discuss some sources.Sources will include earnings, pensions, winnings, benefit payments, pocket money and gifts. The cost of buying nappies: a class for 14-year-olds Is it better to use disposable nappies or washable ones? With 750,000 babies born each year, this is a big issue. A group of 14 year-olds were asked to work out the numbers of nappies used each day and the financial and other costs, including an examination of the environmental consequences. The lesson could be modified to teach to younger age groups. Vital lessons for life - what the syllabus says Age 5-7: Coins and notes Making choices about money (eg spending v saving); The sources of money and the importance of looking after it; Different choices people make about spending; Social and moral issues. Age 8-11: Making simple financial decisions How to spend your cash, including pocket money and charitable donations; Looking after money; Saving; Varying living standards across time and place; Different values and attitudes to money; Calculating simple percentages; Solving problems.

They have been here before, with enigmatic pieces from their current repertoire: this was our chance to revisit the work that made Jiri Kylian's reputation as a choreographer and director. </p> <p>After 25 years with NDT, Kylian has handed over his directorial responsibilities to Marian Sarstadt. He remains as 'artistic adviser', and was very much in charge of rehearsals at the Playhouse with Sir Charles Mackerras and the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra. Only an ambitious festival like this could have brought these musicians and dancers together with Mackerras, who had put his ballet-conducting days behind him. </p> <p>The show-piece of NDT1's triple bill was Sinfonietta, Kylian's 1978 ballet to Jan\u00e1cek's music of the same name. Kylian was commissioned to create a piece at short notice when the Charleston Festival in South Carolina was commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of Jan\u00e1cek's death. The young choreographer's response was so joyously apt that Sinfonietta has remained a favourite with dance audiences ever since. It received a standing ovation in Edinburgh. </p> <p>The dancers soar on the music, lifted by the updraft from the brass section positioned in boxes at the side of the stage. The men cover space in huge leaps, the women assisted in their flight by their partners. There is a sense of urgency, a pressure to communicate, that is missing from Kylian's later works. Danced with such evident relish, this early piece is irresistible. </p> <p>Compared with Balanchine's ballets earlier in the festival, however, Kylian's musicality is unsophisticated. His dancers are not an integral part of the score, used as instruments. They wheel instead like instinctive storks, migrating between homelands. In his 1981 Forgotten Land, another emotive reaction to powerful music, Britten's Sinfonia da Requiem , the backdrop by John Macfarlane suggests the reed beds of the fens or Eastern European marshes. </p> <p>The bleak landscape changes from black and grey to sunlit colour as the community of dancers splits into couples. Mackerras supports them with a thrillingly ominous pulse after the hammer blows of the opening lament. Forgotten Land is one of those angst-ridden pieces to which all too many Kylian imitators resort. Bodies are wracked with grief; spirits rise, only to be dashed; defiant survivors are silhouetted against the dying light. </p> <p>Kylian has since evolved a more eccentric, almost grotesque, way of moving. His house style is reflected, to some extent, in the work of Paul Lightfoot, the English choreographer who seems his heir apparent. Lightfoot's Speak for Yourself was the centrepiece of NDT1's bill at the Playhouse; his Small Moves dominated the Festival Theatre programme shared by NDT2 and 3, the junior and senior companies. </p> <p>In both recent pieces, Lightfoot proposes man as the measure of all things. In Speak for Yourself, to Bach fugues, a solitary figure makes the opening and closing statements. A plume of smoke rises from his body, echoed by mists of golden rain that fall on the other eight parched souls. Their slitherings are eloquent, but even less specific than Kylian's couplings. Lean limbs, slicked with water, trace lovely arcs, but there is a kind of rage that relationships - or lives - are so ephemeral. </p> <p>In Small Moves, for four NDT3 dancers between 40 and 64, the movement becomes increasingly simian: bent knees, dangling arms, shaking heads. The performers, toplit to emphasise their ageing flesh, triumphantly assert their personalities in the face of the indignities inflicted upon them. As in Paulo Ribeiro's New Age for them on the same bill, the challenge is not to appear ridiculous. The company's choreographers share a tendency to make dancers seem dumber than they are - either funny ha ha or funny peculiar, pulling faces and dragging their knuckles along the ground. </p> <p>Only one brief piece in the Festival Theatre programme, Hans van Manen's Solo for NDT2, enabled its three youngsters simply to get out there and dance. Their big company number, however, went down a predictable treat: Ohad Naharin's Minus 16 is a well-tried audience manipulator. It provided a slick synthesis of this year's festival offerings from many sources: ballet and physical theatre merged into modern dance. NDT's combination is not the final solution, thank goodness: the different elements diverge as soon as choreographers find their own voices, forge their own companies.</p>",

But his pictures - both set in a London underworld where it's still Krays after all these years - are like commercials for an undisclosed product or music promos for an unwritten song. </p> <p>After some jocular credits, Snatch begins promisingly with a robbery of a diamond merchant's office in Antwerp by four thieves disguised as Hasidic Jews. Initially they're seen in black and white on a succession of CCTV screens, then when they reach their target, they're in colour as they grab the guns concealed on the chest of their leader. </p> <p>Immediately Ritchie ruins things by speeding up the film, revolving the camera and cutting far too fast, establishing an irritating style that never lets up. </p> <p>The robbers seize an 86-carat stone, big as a plover's egg, and this becomes the MacGuffin that draws together a variety of colourful low-lifers, all murderous, loquacious and none too bright, and most of them racial stereotypes. There are Jewish jewellers (from Hatton Garden and Manhattan); cockney hard men; Russian mafiosi; black thieves and yardies; and a band of Irish travellers led by Brad Pitt, who deliberately talks in a dialect that no one can understand. All have comic nicknames, and apart from chasing the diamond, many of the characters are involved in promoting and betting on illegal bare-knuckle boxing. </p> <p>The only woman in sight, Sorcha Cusack as Pitt's mother, is known simply as Mum O'Neil and is incinerated in her caravan halfway through. </p> <p>The violence is relentless, but somehow less oppressive than the stylised dialogue which is spoken at dictation speed - and runs to such lines as (of Boris the Blade): 'He's as bent as the Soviet sickle and as hard as the hammer that covers it.' Snatch is to The Long Good Friday and Performance what the sentimental underworld stories of Damon Runyon are to the novels of Elmore Leonard or Martin Scorsese's GoodFellas. </p> <p>Neil LaBute's comedy thriller <strong> Nurse Betty </strong> isn't any more realistic than Snatch and has a scene in which a man is suddenly scalped that's infinitely more violent than anything in Ritchie's film. But it has ideas, genuine wit, and a vision that partly comes from a naturally misanthropic director trying to take a benign view of a sweet-natured, dim-witted girl. </p> <p>Ren\u00e9e Zellweger is beguiling as Betty, a waitress in a small Kansas town who escapes from an oppressive husband and a drab life by fantasising that she's a nurse in 'A Reason to Love', her favourite medical TV soap opera. She's rather like Mia Farrow in The Purple Rose of Cairo. But Woody Allen's picture takes a surreal turn, while LaBute submits Betty to the traumatic experience of seeing her husband killed by mob enforcers while she's watching the soap in another room. As a result she experiences what psychiatrists call 'a fugue', a form of amnesia brought on by shock that results in the sufferer fleeing from their real identity into another world. </p> <p>In Betty's case she believes she's the former girlfriend of the soap opera's hero, Dr David Ravell (Greg Kinnear) and heads off to Los Angeles to see him. She's pursued by a philosophical black hitman and his cynical, hip son, played with immense assurance by Morgan Freeman (who calls himself 'a garbage man of the human condition') and Chris Rock. They're after the drugs that the double-crossing husband has stashed in the trunk of the car his innocent wife is driving. </p> <p>The deftly plotted movie, full of sharp dialogue, is about a society that finds it increasingly difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction and whose citizens seek solace in romantic illusion. Betty is merely a clinical example of a national condition and her encounters with - and entry into - the soap world, are hilariously contrived and, within the comic context, convincing. 'I think you set the official record for staying in character two hours ago,' the admiring soap soap star says of the bemused Betty. </p> <p>Adapted from Michel Houellebecq's novel Extension du domaine de la lutte, <strong> Whatever </strong> stars its director Philippe Harel as an articulate, well-off computer expert in his early thirties who has lived alone for two years after the departure of a girlfriend and observes the absurdity of the world around him. Known only as 'Our Hero', he's like the withdrawn, unnamed narrator of Henri Barbusse's novel L'Enfer, Meursault, the protagonist of Camus's L'Etranger to which the film alludes, and the Kevin Spacey character in American Beauty. </p> <p>There are incidents, but not much plot or development - Our Hero drifts through life, dining with a priest he's known since their student days, visiting provincial towns before Christmas with a cheerful, sad-sack colleague (dubbed 'an economic success but a sexual loser') to instruct company executives in new computer systems, having a minor heart attack and a breakdown. The soundtrack alternates between two narrators, one speaking in the third person, the other in the first, and the film's real interest resides in his wry, despondent, well-turned observations philosophical and social. </p> <p>Strindberg's intense three-character play <strong> Miss Julie </strong> is a midsummer night's nightmare in which the wilful daughter of a Swedish count seduces and plays power games with her absent father's valet, Jean, on the family's estate. </p> <p>Written in 1888, it's probably the first time a heroine's behaviour has been attributed to premenstrual tension, and is a key study of hypergamy, the anthropological term for forbidden sexual or marital relationships between people of different classes that the social anthropologist Geoffrey Gorer introduced to the general reader in the Fifties to link Lady Chatterley's Lover, Look Back in Anger and Room at the Top. </p> <p>Anita Bj\u00f6rk was an unforgettable Julie in Alf Sj\u00f6berg's great 1951 film, and probably the best stage version in English to date is Michael Elliott's 1965 National Theatre production starring Maggie Smith and Albert Finney. Mike Figgis's low-budget, highly theatrical Miss Julie isn't in the same class as either of these, and it strikes an early false note when on her first appearance Julie gives Jean a sharp slap in the face rather than the coquettish flick with a handkerchief that Strindberg prescribes. </p> <p>But Saffron Burrows does well enough, towering over the stocky Peter Mullan, and threatening his Scottish burr with her patronising English accent. Maria Doyle Kennedy is a strong, sensible presence as Christine, the mediating cook, but I found the split screen for the sex scenes distracting in the wrong way. </p> <p>Something of a cinematic curiosity, <strong> Twin Falls Idaho </strong> is written by the identical (extremely handsome) twins Michael and Mark Polish, and stars them as mutually reliant, conjoined twins, who've quit the circus to die together in a Californian hotel. </p> <p>It's a slow, atmospheric affair that fails to deliver on its early promise. I was reminded of the legendary night when our own cinematic twins John and Roy Boulting lay in bed, totally silent, beside Spike Milligan, throughout a performance of Son of Oblomov at the Comedy Theatre.

It's a slow, atmospheric affair that fails to deliver on its early promise. I was reminded of the legendary night when our own cinematic twins John and Roy Boulting lay in bed, totally silent, beside Spike Milligan, throughout a performance of Son of Oblomov at the Comedy Theatre. It also occurred to me that if Elisabeth Shue married one of this film's twins she'd be called Elisabeth Shue Polish.",

In the century that has passed since the first Shakespearean movie (the 1899 Beerbohm Tree production of King John) it's the only time that this ferocious play has featured on the screen. This is all the more surprising when one considers that the Polish scholar Jan Kott, author of Shakespeare Our Contemporary, took advantage of the 1957 visit to Warsaw of the Peter Brook-Laurence Olivier Stratford production of Titus Andronicus to write a famous essay claiming that the cinema had revivified the way Shakespeare is performed and appreciated, helping us experience them again in a Renaissance context. </p> <p>Now Julie Taymor, the American theatre director who put Disney's Lion King on the stage, has made her cinematic debut with a bold, breathtaking, superbly acted adaptation called simply Titus. Shakespeare our contemporary indeed, and with a vengeance, revenge becoming the motive of practically everyone involved. Her movie begins with a device used in the disastrous Adrian Noble film of A Midsummer Night's Dream where the whole play is dreamt by a little boy after he's fallen asleep reading the Lambs' Tales From Shakespeare. Here, a little boy is playing war games with his lead soldiers using ketchup as blood when an explosion outside leads to him being swept away to a coliseum in ancient Rome. There he witnesses the Roman general Titus Andronicus (Anthony Hopkins) returning in triumph with his muddy centurions, and with Tamora, Queen of the Goths (Jessica Lange), and her three sons as his prisoners. </p> <p>In a dark, stylised, hieratic sequence, Titus decides to propitiate the deities for the deaths of his many sons by sacrificing to them Tamora's eldest boy, thus earning her undying enmity. Following this primitive opening, the movie modulates from the ancient world into something resembling Mussolini's Rome where Black shirts are rioting in the streets. On the steps of an iconic 1930s building, the fascistic Government Centre, Titus refuses to accept the national leadership, deferring to the late emperor's weak son, Saturninus (Alan Cumming), then acquiescing when Saturninus decides to marry his daughter, Lavinia, who is engaged to the new emperor's brother. Thus by doing his stoical duty to the gods and to the state, Titus has launched a remorseless series of events that will lead to the violent deaths of virtually everybody in the play (more than 30 named characters are killed, mostly on stage, as well as numerous other supporting figures), not to mention mutilation, rape, torture and cannibalism in the famous form of Tamora eating a pie baked from her sons' bodies. </p> <p>Titus Andronicus contains the seeds of the great tragedies that followed - Titus anticipates Lear; his son Lucius (Angus MacFadyen) is a forerunner of Hamlet; Aaron (Harry Lennix), the black-hearted Moor committed to evil, looks forward to Iago; Tamora is the predecessor of Lady Macbeth. But this film refuses to wear the noble cloak of redemptive tragedy, preferring to skip along in a sprightly dance of death, with pauses for black humour and the acknowledgement of unbearable anguish. People may suffer, but they are not ennobled by their experience. The incessant cruelty, the sense that nothing turns out the way people of goodwill expect, is part of the experience of this past century. The abrupt switches of mood, the shafts of black humour, the pick 'n' mix of fashions and styles (in music, setting, decor), the sex 'n' violence, are characteristic of the art of our own time. </p> <p>In an admiring review of the 1955 Brook production in The Observer, Kenneth Tynan remarked that 'it is the casualness of the killing that grows tiresome, as at a bad bullfight'. But though the film has flaws (I'm uneasy about the presence of the observing child, even though eventually he joins the action as Titus's grandson, and I don't like the kitschy visions), it seems to me a great bullfight and Anthony Hopkins's snorting old bull is armed with more than his horns. He and the rest of the cast have magnificent verse to speak and they handle it with verve and clarity </p> <p>Titus starts out as a tired warrior, endures the horrors with stoicism, goes mad, experiences a broken heart, recovers his sanity but only occasionally has glimpses of humanity. He's called upon to kill a son and a daughter, to chop off his own hand, to fire off arrows to attract the gods, to lure an enemy into cannibalism.

      "body": "<p>Lilian Baylis, the godmother of theatrical populism, must be beaming down from luvvie heaven, pleased that the Old Vic is once more in good hands. In 1931 Baylis brought classical ballet to the grimy purlieu of Waterloo; from now until February, the Old Vic is home to Matthew Bourne's Car Man: An Auto-Erotic Thriller, and in 2002 the theatre will become the permanent residence of Bourne's itinerant company, Adventures in Motion Pictures. </p> <p>Of course, Baylis is probably wondering whether what's on her sacred stage qualifies as ballet. Bourne has no time for frills, froufrou and the gauzy spirituality of tradition. The birds in his Swan Lake were menacing male gymnasts not wispy ballerinas, and Highland Fling, his version of La Sylphide, turned the hero's romantic vision into the hallucination of a Glasgow drug addict. Car Man is a riff vaguely based on Bizet's opera Carmen, but with no picturesque gypsies. The characters inhabit a garage and an adjoining diner, and are smeared with grease, frying oil and the sticky humidity of the American South. They copulate on kitchen tables (with much noisy dislodging of pots and pans) and in the back seats of cars (with a frantic creaking of springs). When they fight, they leave the floor puddled with blood. </p> <p>'Our previous shows,' Bourne said to me the other day, 'had a kind of high-society feel, a royal atmosphere - though we were ironic about it.' His Swan Lake, for instance, notoriously re-enacted the marital tribulations of the Windsors. 'This time I wanted to do something dirty, earthy, tethered to the ground. At first I even thought of setting Car Man in a meat factory, with carcasses on hooks. The dancers here are playing real people. It's like rehearsing with actors: we argue about their motives when I suppose we should be designing movements. But my skill is as a director of stories, not movement for its own sake. I'd get bored if I was doing abstract dance.' </p> <p>In Car Man the grounding is musical too. Rather than Bizet's swoony strings, Bourne has chosen a score composed for a Bolshoi Ballet Carmen in 1967 by Rodion Shchedrin, which uses only percussion: a riotous band of 50 assorted noise-makers, whose pounding rhythms erupt from a jukebox on the stage. Percussion prescribes a different kind of movement, centred on the pelvis and on the stamping feet, as opposed to the ethereal arms and aspiring leaps of traditional ballet. Shchedrin's raucous treatment found no favour in Soviet Moscow. The Minister of Culture upbraided him for making 'a heroine of the Spanish people' look like a whore. </p> <p>'As if she weren't one already!' laughed Bourne. 'Anyway, in our version we've got two Carmens, one male and one female - and they're both tarts.' The car man is Luca, a lubed-up, muscular mechanic; his equally promiscuous partner is Lana, the sluttish wife of the slob who owns both the diner and the garage. </p> <p>The seaminess is deliberate, and as erotically thrilling as the subtitle of the show promises. 'People strangely revere dance,' he sighed. 'They see it as another world, and dancers are somehow mysterious - just because they don't speak. What we're doing is definitely not reverential. It can be a bit confusing for ballet directors, who carry on like high priests. When we did Swan Lake on Broadway, they saw queues round the block and asked themselves, \"Where are all these people coming from?\"' </p> <p>Bourne has responded to their sniffiness with a cabaret in the second act of Car Man, which wickedly derides the lofty allegories of modern dance. It is performed in a sleazy nightclub by three beatniks named Jos\u00e9, Erick and Virginia. 'Well,' he shiftily confessed, 'Jos\u00e9 is the choreographer Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n, Erick is Martha Graham's husband Erick Hawkins, and we thought Virginia was the kind of name that suited one of Balanchine's muses.' </p> <p>He giggled at the angst-ridden, mythic charades of Martha Graham, then admitted a more personal grudge. 'When I was trying to be a dancer, I couldn't do any of her movements. I'm very stiff around the hips, and her kicks were agonising for me. In fact, I think she permanently harmed my back.' </p> <p>Bourne's first hero, appropriately, was Fred Astaire - a hoofer, not a faun in tights and slippers. 'He had such naturalness of movement, he showed how dance could emerge from real situations as you were walking down the street. That's always a problem, like justifying the singing in a musical: how do you get across the gap between speech and song? It's why we have a jukebox in Car Man. Astaire accomplished that so effortlessly. And I loved Ginger Rogers too. Somehow she was trashy and classy at the same time. An amazing body, a fantastically loose back!' His own back, more rigid, then did its best to execute one of her Art Deco curves. </p> <p>It's significant that Bourne's admiration does not extend to Gene Kelly. 'He was so pretentious. Astaire never thought of what he was doing as balletic, but Kelly was always trying to dance with women on points. And his choreography is so showy and flashy. He always looks self-satisfied to me' </p> <p>As a teenage autograph collector, Bourne had a nodding acquaintance with Astaire, for whom he stood in wait outside London hotels. 'We never really talked, but he was always gentlemanly. He'd wave to me. Then last year Swan Lake won an Astaire Award for Concept, Design and Choreography in New York, so I met his widow, Robyn. She is one tough lady! She was a jockey, less than half his age, and she'd never seen any of his films when they married in 1980. Now she sells his image. She licensed some company which makes vacuum cleaners to use a digitalised version of Astaire in its ads: he dances while he Hoovers the floor.' Bourne rolled his eyes. A populist he may be, a vulgarian he is not. </p> <p>In 1987 Bourne named his company Adventures in Motion Pictures as a joke, copying the label from a plastic bag which contained headsets on a Chinese airline. The cinema is about kinesis, and ballet too is the study of movement. One of the proud scenic icons in Car Man is a Mobil gas sign, with a flying white horse proclaiming the aerodynamic virtues of the petrol on sale at the garage. Bourne's dances often look like movies by other means. Deadly Serious in 1992 was a homage to Hitchcock; his 1997 Cinderella, set in the London Blitz, owed more to Brief Encounter and Michael Powell's A Matter of Life and Death than to the over-familiar fairytale; and Car Man replaces Bizet's plot with an anthology of situations and images from film noir. 'We had a library of about 150 videos at rehearsals, so the dancers could borrow films overnight and look for things to use.

      "bodyText": "Lilian Baylis, the godmother of theatrical populism, must be beaming down from luvvie heaven, pleased that the Old Vic is once more in good hands. In 1931 Baylis brought classical ballet to the grimy purlieu of Waterloo; from now until February, the Old Vic is home to Matthew Bourne's Car Man: An Auto-Erotic Thriller, and in 2002 the theatre will become the permanent residence of Bourne's itinerant company, Adventures in Motion Pictures. Of course, Baylis is probably wondering whether what's on her sacred stage qualifies as ballet. Bourne has no time for frills, froufrou and the gauzy spirituality of tradition. The birds in his Swan Lake were menacing male gymnasts not wispy ballerinas, and Highland Fling, his version of La Sylphide, turned the hero's romantic vision into the hallucination of a Glasgow drug addict. Car Man is a riff vaguely based on Bizet's opera Carmen, but with no picturesque gypsies. The characters inhabit a garage and an adjoining diner, and are smeared with grease, frying oil and the sticky humidity of the American South. They copulate on kitchen tables (with much noisy dislodging of pots and pans) and in the back seats of cars (with a frantic creaking of springs). When they fight, they leave the floor puddled with blood. 'Our previous shows,' Bourne said to me the other day, 'had a kind of high-society feel, a royal atmosphere - though we were ironic about it.' His Swan Lake, for instance, notoriously re-enacted the marital tribulations of the Windsors. 'This time I wanted to do something dirty, earthy, tethered to the ground. At first I even thought of setting Car Man in a meat factory, with carcasses on hooks. The dancers here are playing real people. It's like rehearsing with actors: we argue about their motives when I suppose we should be designing movements. But my skill is as a director of stories, not movement for its own sake. I'd get bored if I was doing abstract dance.' In Car Man the grounding is musical too. Rather than Bizet's swoony strings, Bourne has chosen a score composed for a Bolshoi Ballet Carmen in 1967 by Rodion Shchedrin, which uses only percussion: a riotous band of 50 assorted noise-makers, whose pounding rhythms erupt from a jukebox on the stage. Percussion prescribes a different kind of movement, centred on the pelvis and on the stamping feet, as opposed to the ethereal arms and aspiring leaps of traditional ballet. Shchedrin's raucous treatment found no favour in Soviet Moscow. The Minister of Culture upbraided him for making 'a heroine of the Spanish people' look like a whore. 'As if she weren't one already!' laughed Bourne. 'Anyway, in our version we've got two Carmens, one male and one female - and they're both tarts.' The car man is Luca, a lubed-up, muscular mechanic; his equally promiscuous partner is Lana, the sluttish wife of the slob who owns both the diner and the garage. The seaminess is deliberate, and as erotically thrilling as the subtitle of the show promises. 'People strangely revere dance,' he sighed. 'They see it as another world, and dancers are somehow mysterious - just because they don't speak. What we're doing is definitely not reverential. It can be a bit confusing for ballet directors, who carry on like high priests. When we did Swan Lake on Broadway, they saw queues round the block and asked themselves, \"Where are all these people coming from?\"' Bourne has responded to their sniffiness with a cabaret in the second act of Car Man, which wickedly derides the lofty allegories of modern dance. It is performed in a sleazy nightclub by three beatniks named Jos\u00e9, Erick and Virginia. 'Well,' he shiftily confessed, 'Jos\u00e9 is the choreographer Jos\u00e9 Lim\u00f3n, Erick is Martha Graham's husband Erick Hawkins, and we thought Virginia was the kind of name that suited one of Balanchine's muses.' He giggled at the angst-ridden, mythic charades of Martha Graham, then admitted a more personal grudge. 'When I was trying to be a dancer, I couldn't do any of her movements. I'm very stiff around the hips, and her kicks were agonising for me. In fact, I think she permanently harmed my back.' Bourne's first hero, appropriately, was Fred Astaire - a hoofer, not a faun in tights and slippers. 'He had such naturalness of movement, he showed how dance could emerge from real situations as you were walking down the street. That's always a problem, like justifying the singing in a musical: how do you get across the gap between speech and song? It's why we have a jukebox in Car Man. Astaire accomplished that so effortlessly. And I loved Ginger Rogers too. Somehow she was trashy and classy at the same time. An amazing body, a fantastically loose back!' His own back, more rigid, then did its best to execute one of her Art Deco curves. It's significant that Bourne's admiration does not extend to Gene Kelly. 'He was so pretentious. Astaire never thought of what he was doing as balletic, but Kelly was always trying to dance with women on points. And his choreography is so showy and flashy. He always looks self-satisfied to me' As a teenage autograph collector, Bourne had a nodding acquaintance with Astaire, for whom he stood in wait outside London hotels. 'We never really talked, but he was always gentlemanly. He'd wave to me. Then last year Swan Lake won an Astaire Award for Concept, Design and Choreography in New York, so I met his widow, Robyn. She is one tough lady! She was a jockey, less than half his age, and she'd never seen any of his films when they married in 1980. Now she sells his image. She licensed some company which makes vacuum cleaners to use a digitalised version of Astaire in its ads: he dances while he Hoovers the floor.' Bourne rolled his eyes. A populist he may be, a vulgarian he is not. In 1987 Bourne named his company Adventures in Motion Pictures as a joke, copying the label from a plastic bag which contained headsets on a Chinese airline. The cinema is about kinesis, and ballet too is the study of movement. One of the proud scenic icons in Car Man is a Mobil gas sign, with a flying white horse proclaiming the aerodynamic virtues of the petrol on sale at the garage. Bourne's dances often look like movies by other means. Deadly Serious in 1992 was a homage to Hitchcock; his 1997 Cinderella, set in the London Blitz, owed more to Brief Encounter and Michael Powell's A Matter of Life and Death than to the over-familiar fairytale; and Car Man replaces Bizet's plot with an anthology of situations and images from film noir. 'We had a library of about 150 videos at rehearsals, so the dancers could borrow films overnight and look for things to use. The sign outside the garage, Man Wanted, comes from the old The Postman Always Rings Twice, and the heroine's name is borrowed from Lana Turner, who's in it - though we dirtied her up a bit, made her less glossy.

      "body": "<p>Bristol is the most ambivalent of Britain's big cities, unable to make up its mind about itself. </p> <p>Is it the western end of the booming M4 corridor, a beautifully sited, affluent city with a rich architectural heritage, underpinned by a cluster of insurance companies and high-tech factories? Or is it the southernmost outpost of the urban victim culture of Liverpool, another city with a great past but a doubtful future? </p> <p>Visitors see Clifton and the magnificent gothic silhouette of St Mary Redcliffe, the waterscape, the Arnolfini, the pavement caf\u00e9s, and they assume that they are looking at a picture of urban prosperity - Britain's own Seattle. But it is also a city with recent memories of its own race riots, inner-city slums, and cider-soaked estates, not perhaps quite in the same league of deprivation as Liverpool, but getting there. </p> <p>Bristol sees itself as the victim of predatory outsiders, of whom the least favourite are hit-and-run developers and their architects who come and go oblivious to the damage they do. Certainly Bristol spent too much of the Sixties and Seventies disembowelling itself in an alarmingly successful attempt to rid itself of the distinctive character of a waterfront city. And it is that legacy that has left it still locked in battles over redevelopment of a kind that anywhere else would seem like a throwback to the Seventies. </p> <p>Bristol presents itself as a deprived city in order to milk Millennium Commission funding and regional development grants, which puts it in the paradoxical position of having to convince the world not of the obvious truth that it's an attractive place to live and work, but one that is, behind the elegant facades, in serious trouble. And yet it is also attractive enough to persuade developers that they can make a profit. </p> <p>Canon's Marsh is the focus of the battle for Bristol's identity. It's a big waterfront site, in the shadow of the cathedral. Prosperous in the nineteenth century this tangle of wharves and yards was cut off and left to rot for almost 40 years when containerisation pushed the big ships out to Avonmouth. </p> <p>After Arup Associates designed an overly mannered office building for Lloyds on the water's edge in the Eighties and showed that the area could have a new future, Bristol has struggled to turn Canon's Marsh into a cultural quarter, but one that looks more like a descendant of the Dome rather than South Kensington. It has pulled in nearly \u00a3100 million of funding, the biggest chunk of which came from a \u00a340m Lottery award. The money has gone toward setting up a variety of different institutions, devoted to science and natural history - they call them 'attractions' - grouped around a new civic square, washed by a vigorous array of fountains and infested by jokey public sculpture. The original vision included an arts centre, designed, after an international architectural competition, by the German firm of Behnisch &amp; Behnisch. This project collapsed when the Arts Council changed its mind about funding it - to the fury of all concerned. The place goes by the unfortunate name of @ Bristol. </p> <p>The first piece of the complex to open was Explore @ Bristol (an interactive science museum), Wilkinson Eyre's deft conversion of a former railway goods shed, listed mainly on the grounds of its pioneering concrete structure. Now Michael Hopkins has finished the neighbouring Wildscreen @ Bristol and the Bristol Imax. An Imax cinema is probably the single most characteristic product of the Lottery- funded building avalanche overtaking Britain. Ideal because it is seen as the kind of project that lends itself to creating the maximum impact with the least effort. </p> <p>A windowless auditorium is perfect for creating object buildings with wacky shapes, which means that promoters can tick the box marked 'suitably millennial in its aspirations' on the relevant funding applications without unduly exerting themselves. And it is also, in theory at least, undemanding to run. The audience shows up to gasp at the disorienting vertigo-inducing sense of flight or whatever. No wonder they are popping up all over the place. That was the theory. But, as the London Imax is discovering, getting repeat visits is much less easy than had been hoped. </p> <p>Sensibly, Michael Hopkins has avoided the trap of conforming to the usual architectural Imax stereotypes. Instead of succumbing to the temptation of floating a mirror-glass bowl in a pool of reflecting water, Hopkins has tried to create a sensitive bit of urban fabric hiding the Imax in a bigger structure that houses a complicated mixture of functions, part exhibition space, part climate-controlled conservatory in which real tropical plants coexist with concrete trees and plastic snakes. </p> <p>Hopkins has created a sense that all this new building is more than a novelty act, and is an integral part of the rest of the city. The bulk of Wildscreen is housed in a warm redbrick structure. It is pierced by the conservatory, housed in what looks like a string of benders, and supported by a pair of masts. By not doing the obvious thing, Hopkins allows visitors to discover the Imax for themselves, a strategy which is likely to give the place greater longevity. </p> <p>@ Bristol was always seen as the starting point for regeneration. The next phase of the rebuilding of Canon's Marsh has provoked a bitter row. A local firm of architects led by George Ferguson, who was involved with designing the public spaces of @ Bristol has seen off what he presented as a visiting goliath. </p> <p>Arup Associates drew up a scheme for a new cinema, along with flats and offices for Crest, a developer with an option on the site from the city council. Ferguson claimed to be appalled and drew up a counter proposal that he called Little Venice at the Harbourside. 'I was defending the place in which I live, and which I love. Arups just got it wrong, they didn't define space properly, and they would have blocked all the views of the cathedral from the water.' </p> <p>His strategy worked brilliantly. Crest dropped Arups and brought in Ted Cullinan to do another masterplan. 'I hope it works, I'd like to see it built by lots of different architects, some from outside Bristol sure, but there are some good architects here already,' says Ferguson. Perhaps he is right, and Bristol really does have a distinctive contemporary architectural culture, but so far it's been hard to see where it is.</p>",

Is it the western end of the booming M4 corridor, a beautifully sited, affluent city with a rich architectural heritage, underpinned by a cluster of insurance companies and high-tech factories? Or is it the southernmost outpost of the urban victim culture of Liverpool, another city with a great past but a doubtful future? Visitors see Clifton and the magnificent gothic silhouette of St Mary Redcliffe, the waterscape, the Arnolfini, the pavement caf\u00e9s, and they assume that they are looking at a picture of urban prosperity - Britain's own Seattle. But it is also a city with recent memories of its own race riots, inner-city slums, and cider-soaked estates, not perhaps quite in the same league of deprivation as Liverpool, but getting there. Bristol sees itself as the victim of predatory outsiders, of whom the least favourite are hit-and-run developers and their architects who come and go oblivious to the damage they do. Certainly Bristol spent too much of the Sixties and Seventies disembowelling itself in an alarmingly successful attempt to rid itself of the distinctive character of a waterfront city. And it is that legacy that has left it still locked in battles over redevelopment of a kind that anywhere else would seem like a throwback to the Seventies. Bristol presents itself as a deprived city in order to milk Millennium Commission funding and regional development grants, which puts it in the paradoxical position of having to convince the world not of the obvious truth that it's an attractive place to live and work, but one that is, behind the elegant facades, in serious trouble. And yet it is also attractive enough to persuade developers that they can make a profit. Canon's Marsh is the focus of the battle for Bristol's identity. It's a big waterfront site, in the shadow of the cathedral. Prosperous in the nineteenth century this tangle of wharves and yards was cut off and left to rot for almost 40 years when containerisation pushed the big ships out to Avonmouth. After Arup Associates designed an overly mannered office building for Lloyds on the water's edge in the Eighties and showed that the area could have a new future, Bristol has struggled to turn Canon's Marsh into a cultural quarter, but one that looks more like a descendant of the Dome rather than South Kensington. It has pulled in nearly \u00a3100 million of funding, the biggest chunk of which came from a \u00a340m Lottery award. The money has gone toward setting up a variety of different institutions, devoted to science and natural history - they call them 'attractions' - grouped around a new civic square, washed by a vigorous array of fountains and infested by jokey public sculpture. The original vision included an arts centre, designed, after an international architectural competition, by the German firm of Behnisch &amp; Behnisch. This project collapsed when the Arts Council changed its mind about funding it - to the fury of all concerned. The place goes by the unfortunate name of @ Bristol. The first piece of the complex to open was Explore @ Bristol (an interactive science museum), Wilkinson Eyre's deft conversion of a former railway goods shed, listed mainly on the grounds of its pioneering concrete structure. Now Michael Hopkins has finished the neighbouring Wildscreen @ Bristol and the Bristol Imax. An Imax cinema is probably the single most characteristic product of the Lottery- funded building avalanche overtaking Britain. Ideal because it is seen as the kind of project that lends itself to creating the maximum impact with the least effort. A windowless auditorium is perfect for creating object buildings with wacky shapes, which means that promoters can tick the box marked 'suitably millennial in its aspirations' on the relevant funding applications without unduly exerting themselves. And it is also, in theory at least, undemanding to run. The audience shows up to gasp at the disorienting vertigo-inducing sense of flight or whatever. No wonder they are popping up all over the place. That was the theory. But, as the London Imax is discovering, getting repeat visits is much less easy than had been hoped. Sensibly, Michael Hopkins has avoided the trap of conforming to the usual architectural Imax stereotypes. Instead of succumbing to the temptation of floating a mirror-glass bowl in a pool of reflecting water, Hopkins has tried to create a sensitive bit of urban fabric hiding the Imax in a bigger structure that houses a complicated mixture of functions, part exhibition space, part climate-controlled conservatory in which real tropical plants coexist with concrete trees and plastic snakes. Hopkins has created a sense that all this new building is more than a novelty act, and is an integral part of the rest of the city. The bulk of Wildscreen is housed in a warm redbrick structure. It is pierced by the conservatory, housed in what looks like a string of benders, and supported by a pair of masts. By not doing the obvious thing, Hopkins allows visitors to discover the Imax for themselves, a strategy which is likely to give the place greater longevity. @ Bristol was always seen as the starting point for regeneration. The next phase of the rebuilding of Canon's Marsh has provoked a bitter row. A local firm of architects led by George Ferguson, who was involved with designing the public spaces of @ Bristol has seen off what he presented as a visiting goliath. Arup Associates drew up a scheme for a new cinema, along with flats and offices for Crest, a developer with an option on the site from the city council. Ferguson claimed to be appalled and drew up a counter proposal that he called Little Venice at the Harbourside. 'I was defending the place in which I live, and which I love. Arups just got it wrong, they didn't define space properly, and they would have blocked all the views of the cathedral from the water.' His strategy worked brilliantly. Crest dropped Arups and brought in Ted Cullinan to do another masterplan. 'I hope it works, I'd like to see it built by lots of different architects, some from outside Bristol sure, but there are some good architects here already,' says Ferguson. Perhaps he is right, and Bristol really does have a distinctive contemporary architectural culture, but so far it's been hard to see where it is.",

      "body": "<p>In 1996, the photographer Corinne Day collapsed in her apartment in New York and had a seizure. Her flatmate called the paramedics, and when she regained consciousness, she immediately asked him to bring her camera into the ambulance to record it all. Not the first instinct most of us would have in the circumstances, but then Day has never claimed to be ordinary. 'The camera becomes a part of your life,' she says matter-of-factly. 'I'm a photography junkie. I'm just driven. I don't know why.' </p> <p>And so it is, in her new book Diary, that you can see Day lying in a bed in Belvue hospital looking frightened and confused seconds after being told she had a brain tumour. You can see the needle being pushed into her forehead just before the operation to remove it, and you see her looking terrified in the lift going down to the theatre. These pictures were taken by her boyfriend of 13 years, Mark Szaszy, who says it was hard to do because his hands were shaking with emotion. 'But I knew if I did it, it would take her mind off what was happening.' </p> <p>Diary consists of 100 photographs taken over a 10-year period, a raw, unflinching look at the lives of Day and her friends. It's a high-quality art book, beautifully presented, but most of the images make uncomfortable viewing. Some are painfully intimate, some unbearably sad, many focusing around Tara St Hill, a single mother in her early twenties, struggling to bring up her baby daughter with little money and the pain of Crohn's Disease. </p> <p>Nothing is taboo, too private to show in this book. There's a picture of Day pretending to masturbate. Another shows her bloody knickers. We see Day and her friends taking drugs, having parties, in the bath, injured after accidents and fights. We see Tara pregnant, Tara crying, Tara having sex, Tara on the loo. 'To me, photography is about showing us things that we don't normally see,' explains Day. 'Getting as close as you can to real life. What I found interesting was to capture people's most intimate moments. And sometimes intimacy is sad. In photos, we're usually laughing and happy and having a good time. We don't normally see the other side, when we're not having such a good time.' </p> <p>Corrine Day has always been unconventional. She was bought up by her nan in the village of Ickenham just to the west of London. Her mother, she claims, ran a brothel. Her father was 'in and out of trouble' in his youth, then busy building a legitimate business empire. He wasn't that interested in kids, and she didn't really get to know him until she was older. It was his obsession with money, she says, that made her so indifferent to it. 'My dad was incredibly driven by money, and I felt like I lost him to it. When I was a kid he had a big house, but I hated going there. It never felt like home. There was no love there.' </p> <p>'Too busy being naughty' to learn much at school, she earned a meagre living afterwards flying round the world as a courier. A photographer she met on a plane suggested she take up modelling, and although she was considered short at 5ft 6in, she did a lot of catalogue work, living in Japan for a while - where she met Mark Szaszy - and then in LA. It was the mid-Eighties, when glamour was compulsory, but Day's face didn't take the required layers of make-up too well. </p> <p>'I don't have great cheekbones, or huge lips to pile lipstick on - it didn't suit me. I wasn't really a conventional beauty, I was quite plain-looking for a model. When I first saw Christy Turlington, all my hopes of ever getting on the cover of Vogue were gone. So I just made the best of it, and enjoyed it - I loved the travelling. We went to Australia, Spain, and ended up in Milan. That's where I started to take pictures. Mark had a camera, and he taught me how to use it.' </p> <p>Her subjects were other struggling models, photographed in their own clothes in the seedy hostels where they lived. 'I started to realise that it was ambiguous, the life. Even though you're surrounded by all this glamour, there was a lot of sadness. We couldn't buy the clothes that we were photographed in, couldn't afford to go out and do the things we would have liked to do as teenagers.' </p> <p>She took her work to The Face's art director Phil Bicker, who was opening up the magazine to a new generation of young, innovative talent at the end of the Eighties. Bicker asked her to shoot some fashion pictures, but having been away from England for five years, she had no contacts with models. So she trawled the London agencies looking for new talent, eventually spotting a Polaroid of a teenager from Croydon. At 14, Kate Moss was 10 years younger than Day, but they connected almost instantly. </p> <p>'She was a beauty, but there was also something quite ordinary about her: her hair was a bit scraggy, and with no make-up she just looked like the girl next door. I encouraged her to be natural. I'd chat to her and then take the pictures in the middle of the conversation. I was trying to get the person to just bring themselves to the camera.' </p> <p>Bicker made Kate Moss the face of The Face, and Day's best images of her summed up the mood of British youth after the rave explosion. But Moss and her agency weren't always happy with the pictures. Moss got teased at school for exposing her flat chest in one classic 1990 shoot, and the agency worried that the photographer deliberately left in imperfections like bags under the eyes that others would have retouched. But for Day, this was the point. 'It was something I just felt so deep inside, being a model and hating the way I was made up. The photographer always made me into someone I wasn't. I wanted to go in the opposite direction.' </p> <p>Working with stylist Melanie Ward, Day and a handful of other photographers such as David Sims began using second-hand clothes and ungroomed, unconventional-looking models discovered in the street. The look they pioneered began to take off, christened 'waif' at first, then merging seamlessly with the US grunge scene. At the Paris shows, Ward and Day would laugh to see the second-hand clothes they'd shot six months before being imitated on the catwalk. </p> <p>But Day was ambivalent about her growing success. She photographed the couture collections for Vogue, but hated it. She did a shoot with Linda Evangelista, and found it pointless. 'She just didn't excite me. Photographing someone you don't know and never plan to see again is so impersonal. The photograph means nothing. When Kate and I did our first Vogue cover, that was exciting.' </p> <p>As the look was assimilated into the mainstream, so were the group who created it. Kate Moss signed to Calvin Klein. Melanie Ward moved to New York to work for Harper's Bazaar. The photographers Day had come up with became the new stars of the fashion world, shooting big-budget advertising campaigns. Unimpressed by money or fame, Day instead became increasingly drawn to the kind of documentary art photographs taken by Nan Goldin. </p> <p>By 1993, she had alienated almost everyone she worked with - although she would probably say that they all let her down. She shot a sad-looking Kate Moss for Vogue wearing cheap undies, baggy tights and no make-up. Published during the summer lull when all news is gratefully pounced upon by the media, the story provoked outrage, with claims that it was promoting anorexia, drugs, even paedophilia. It was the end of her relationship with Vogue, and, for a while, with Moss. </p> <p>Corinne Day met Tara St Hill in 1991 and began photographing her and her boyfriend. By 1993, they were all involved with a dark, heavy British rock band called Pusherman, and as Day's fashion family fell apart, she replaced it instead with this new gang of friends. Everyone partied and took drugs - cannabis, ketamine, heroin - although Day says she never developed a habit. 'I never liked heroin that much. It's a very overrated drug.' </p> <p>The pictures she took over the next four years form the basis of Diary, and publishing them seems to have freed her to move on. Day and Szaszy haven't done drugs for over a year. He's making a documentary about her work. She's starting to take fashion pictures again. She did a shoot for Vogue recently, working with Kate Moss for the first time in seven years. It was fun, she says, like no time had passed at all. She's shooting for the magazines now, not for herself. </p> <p>'My attitude is more businesslike, not so aggressive. I'm keeping within the boundaries. It's interesting - I've actually come to a point in my life where I want to make money.' She laughs. 'I've realised that it can be quite useful.' </p> <p>She and Szaszy want a dog now. A house with a garden, possibly in LA. And then maybe children. The last shot in Diary shows a beautiful, palm-fringed beach littered with tin cans. It's a metaphor, she says, for the whole book. If there's a message she wants the viewer to take away, it is that life can be beautiful, and yet it's also fragile, and we often trash it. 'We don't realise how precious it is.' </p> <p>\u0095 Corinne Day's work is on show at the Photographer's Gallery in London, 5 Oct to 26 Nov, and at Gimpel Fils in London, 6 Oct to 17 Nov.

We see Day and her friends taking drugs, having parties, in the bath, injured after accidents and fights. We see Tara pregnant, Tara crying, Tara having sex, Tara on the loo. 'To me, photography is about showing us things that we don't normally see,' explains Day. 'Getting as close as you can to real life. What I found interesting was to capture people's most intimate moments. And sometimes intimacy is sad. In photos, we're usually laughing and happy and having a good time. We don't normally see the other side, when we're not having such a good time.' Corrine Day has always been unconventional. She was bought up by her nan in the village of Ickenham just to the west of London. Her mother, she claims, ran a brothel. Her father was 'in and out of trouble' in his youth, then busy building a legitimate business empire. He wasn't that interested in kids, and she didn't really get to know him until she was older. It was his obsession with money, she says, that made her so indifferent to it. 'My dad was incredibly driven by money, and I felt like I lost him to it. When I was a kid he had a big house, but I hated going there. It never felt like home. There was no love there.' 'Too busy being naughty' to learn much at school, she earned a meagre living afterwards flying round the world as a courier. A photographer she met on a plane suggested she take up modelling, and although she was considered short at 5ft 6in, she did a lot of catalogue work, living in Japan for a while - where she met Mark Szaszy - and then in LA. It was the mid-Eighties, when glamour was compulsory, but Day's face didn't take the required layers of make-up too well. 'I don't have great cheekbones, or huge lips to pile lipstick on - it didn't suit me. I wasn't really a conventional beauty, I was quite plain-looking for a model. When I first saw Christy Turlington, all my hopes of ever getting on the cover of Vogue were gone. So I just made the best of it, and enjoyed it - I loved the travelling. We went to Australia, Spain, and ended up in Milan. That's where I started to take pictures. Mark had a camera, and he taught me how to use it.' Her subjects were other struggling models, photographed in their own clothes in the seedy hostels where they lived. 'I started to realise that it was ambiguous, the life. Even though you're surrounded by all this glamour, there was a lot of sadness. We couldn't buy the clothes that we were photographed in, couldn't afford to go out and do the things we would have liked to do as teenagers.' She took her work to The Face's art director Phil Bicker, who was opening up the magazine to a new generation of young, innovative talent at the end of the Eighties. Bicker asked her to shoot some fashion pictures, but having been away from England for five years, she had no contacts with models. So she trawled the London agencies looking for new talent, eventually spotting a Polaroid of a teenager from Croydon. At 14, Kate Moss was 10 years younger than Day, but they connected almost instantly. 'She was a beauty, but there was also something quite ordinary about her: her hair was a bit scraggy, and with no make-up she just looked like the girl next door. I encouraged her to be natural. I'd chat to her and then take the pictures in the middle of the conversation. I was trying to get the person to just bring themselves to the camera.' Bicker made Kate Moss the face of The Face, and Day's best images of her summed up the mood of British youth after the rave explosion. But Moss and her agency weren't always happy with the pictures. Moss got teased at school for exposing her flat chest in one classic 1990 shoot, and the agency worried that the photographer deliberately left in imperfections like bags under the eyes that others would have retouched. But for Day, this was the point. 'It was something I just felt so deep inside, being a model and hating the way I was made up. The photographer always made me into someone I wasn't. I wanted to go in the opposite direction.' Working with stylist Melanie Ward, Day and a handful of other photographers such as David Sims began using second-hand clothes and ungroomed, unconventional-looking models discovered in the street. The look they pioneered began to take off, christened 'waif' at first, then merging seamlessly with the US grunge scene. At the Paris shows, Ward and Day would laugh to see the second-hand clothes they'd shot six months before being imitated on the catwalk. But Day was ambivalent about her growing success. She photographed the couture collections for Vogue, but hated it. She did a shoot with Linda Evangelista, and found it pointless. 'She just didn't excite me. Photographing someone you don't know and never plan to see again is so impersonal. The photograph means nothing. When Kate and I did our first Vogue cover, that was exciting.' As the look was assimilated into the mainstream, so were the group who created it. Kate Moss signed to Calvin Klein. Melanie Ward moved to New York to work for Harper's Bazaar. The photographers Day had come up with became the new stars of the fashion world, shooting big-budget advertising campaigns. Unimpressed by money or fame, Day instead became increasingly drawn to the kind of documentary art photographs taken by Nan Goldin. By 1993, she had alienated almost everyone she worked with - although she would probably say that they all let her down. She shot a sad-looking Kate Moss for Vogue wearing cheap undies, baggy tights and no make-up. Published during the summer lull when all news is gratefully pounced upon by the media, the story provoked outrage, with claims that it was promoting anorexia, drugs, even paedophilia. It was the end of her relationship with Vogue, and, for a while, with Moss. Corinne Day met Tara St Hill in 1991 and began photographing her and her boyfriend. By 1993, they were all involved with a dark, heavy British rock band called Pusherman, and as Day's fashion family fell apart, she replaced it instead with this new gang of friends. Everyone partied and took drugs - cannabis, ketamine, heroin - although Day says she never developed a habit. 'I never liked heroin that much. It's a very overrated drug.' The pictures she took over the next four years form the basis of Diary, and publishing them seems to have freed her to move on. Day and Szaszy haven't done drugs for over a year. He's making a documentary about her work. She's starting to take fashion pictures again. She did a shoot for Vogue recently, working with Kate Moss for the first time in seven years. It was fun, she says, like no time had passed at all. She's shooting for the magazines now, not for herself. 'My attitude is more businesslike, not so aggressive. I'm keeping within the boundaries. It's interesting - I've actually come to a point in my life where I want to make money.' She laughs. 'I've realised that it can be quite useful.' She and Szaszy want a dog now. A house with a garden, possibly in LA. And then maybe children. The last shot in Diary shows a beautiful, palm-fringed beach littered with tin cans. It's a metaphor, she says, for the whole book. If there's a message she wants the viewer to take away, it is that life can be beautiful, and yet it's also fragile, and we often trash it. 'We don't realise how precious it is.' \u0095 Corinne Day's work is on show at the Photographer's Gallery in London, 5 Oct to 26 Nov, and at Gimpel Fils in London, 6 Oct to 17 Nov. Diary is published next month by Kruse Verlag. Imperfect Beauty, a collection of pictures by the generation of photographers, stylists and art directors who came through in the early Nineties, includes Corinne Day and is published by V&amp;A Books this month, with an exhibition at the V&amp;A museum.

      "body": "<p>Phan Thi Kim Phuc pulled back a corner of the curtain at the bedroom window. It was the only window in her tiny flat from which you could see further than the side wall of the house next door. If she had looked up over the roofs of Chinatown, where she lived, she could have seen Toronto's modern downtown skyline, but she wasn't thinking about the view. She scanned the pavement for anybody watching, then looked down at the uncovered porch below: nobody. But the evidence remained: a crushed drink can and the red-and-white carton of a Kentucky Fried Chicken lunch from the branch at the top of the street.</p> <p>The previous evening, she and her husband, Toan Bui, believing they had entered their apartment unseen by coming up the back stairs, had looked from this window, and noticing the can and carton, realised the two women they had just met on the street had been staking out their flat for some time that day, at least long enough to get hungry. One of them had a camera. Kim had cautioned her husband against opening the front door to put out the rubbish.</p> <p>How did the two women know her address? Why had they been waiting outside all day?</p> <p>The day came to an end, marking the beginning of the weekend, when Kim's solicitor's office would be closed. By Sunday, she was relieved to be able to go to church in Ajax, an hour away from Toronto. Since she and her husband were the only Vietnamese in the congregation, it seemed unlikely her past would ever come up. But after the service, when she and Toan went to collect their 11-month-old son Thomas from the cr\u00e9che, one of the priests told them Kim's picture was in the newspaper. He held up a Toronto tabloid. 'The photograph that shocked the world' said the headline, above a picture of a young girl, naked and running in terror. There was another headline, 'Child of war is a woman living in Toronto' alongside another picture, one of Kim, wearing the coat she'd been wearing all week.</p> <p>Clearly, the two women had got the photograph they'd come looking for. 'Yes,' Kim told the priest, 'I am the girl in the picture.'</p> <p>The newspaper that broke the story - that the subject of one of the most famous images from the Vietnam war now lived in the West - was the Mail on Sunday. The date was 19 March 1995. Toronto's Sunday Sun bought the story and ran it across pages two and three. Accompanying the article were photographs of Kim and Toan pushing their baby in a buggy along a Toronto street, and of Kim's parents in front of their mud hut in Trang Bang, Vietnam.</p> <p>The story was picked up by the international wire services. Within a couple of days, Kim's phone began to ring, and didn't stop. The doorbell rang almost constantly. Kim grew afraid to leave the house. She hardly slept and, exhausted, spent entire days in her dressing grown.</p> <p>This was not the scenario she had contemplated when, a few months earlier, she had decided that, in order to support the family, she would re-emerge from her secret life and sell her story; it would be her 'work'.</p> <p>She had gone for advice to Nancy Pocock, a long-time adviser to Vietnamese refugees in Canada, who knew a prominent Toronto entertainment lawyer. Before making the introduction, Pocock had wanted to make certain that Kim understood something: once she invited publicity, there would be no going back. Kim had accepted this, but a month on she was having second thoughts. She worried that newspapers would get the story and pictures of her without paying a penny. She felt as though she was becoming a victim all over again. She told her husband: 'It's like another bomb falling out of the sky.'</p> <p><b>Trang Bang, 5 June 1972 </b><br> Communist troops have broken through Route 1, the highway running northwest from Saigon and over the border of South Vietnam with Cambodia to Phnom Penh, and are occupying the market place in Trang Bang. Soldiers from the US-backed South Vietnamese army have been called in and a bloody bombardment has begun. The villagers have abandoned their homes and moved into the nearby Codai temple. They think the holy place will be safe from 'the fire which falls from heaven'.</p> <p>On the morning of 8 June 1972 Associated Press photographer Nick Ut and his driver approached Trang Bang on Route 1. Refugees were clogging the road, heading east. Women carried babies, men shouldered poles balancing clothing and pots and pans, children carried babies and led water buffalo on ropes. The old and injured rode on oxcarts. Heavy smoke hung in the air above Trang Bang and planes were circling. The sound of Soviet- and Chinese-produced weapons confirmed the presence of North Vietnamese soldiers. Just outside the town, traffic was stopped behind concertina barbed wire stretched across the road. Ut flashed his pass to the military police, identifying himself as a journalist. He could go no farther than the small elevated bridge. As the morning progressed, more than a dozen foreign newsmen arrived. There were television crews from NBC and ITN and at least three other photographers. Three British journalists, among them William Shawcross for the Sunday Times, arrived by chance: the roadblock had waylaid their plans to take a sight-seeing trip to the Holy See.</p> <p>A senior officer from the South Vietnamese army told the journalists that the objective on this third day of fighting was to drive the Viet Cong into the treeline, and therefore out of town, so the highway could be reopened. The plan was to launch a ground assault with air support. Two or three times that morning, South Vietnamese planes came in on bombing runs. Ground assaults followed: government soldiers, moving in single file, swung in wide arcs through waist-high grass in the fields. Nick got shots of planes coming in. He shot soldiers on their bellies aiming grenade-launchers and firing machine guns, and soldiers rushing out the wounded on stretchers. These were images he had recorded hundreds of times before.</p> <p>The crowd at the roadblock, many of whom had been there three days, was like an audience at an air show. At the sound of an approaching aircraft, they would stand, transfixed, and then gaze at the explosion and fires half a mile away. In between times, a boy peddled ice-cream cones from his bicycle to the line of stalled traffic. Some of the crowd crouched in the shade of their vehicles, snacked on bananas and savoured the sticky, sweet pulp of the last of the star apples of the season.</p> <p>Sometimes, during the lulls, the crowd caught sight of uniformed North Vietnamese soldiers dragging wounded colleagues to safety. It was the first time many had seen 'soldiers from Hanoi'. Reassured by their presence they agreed that it was unthinkable that either the Communists or the government would attack a holy place.</p> <p>Late that morning the clouds had formed a low-lying blanket and the typical afternoon downpour of the wettest summer months began. The photographers and television cameramen covered their equipment with army-issue rain ponchos. The photographers looked about to see if anyone was thinking about calling it a day: the cloud cover would mean a halt in air strikes and, therefore, ground assaults.</p> <p>They compared notes about what 'today's picture' would be: refugees on the road, people fleeing the town. Ut took his lunch of French cheese and baguette from his camera bag. He decided to leave by 2pm, because of the heavy refugee traffic. One o'clock came and went without a break in the cloud cover. Some of his colleagues left, presuming that the Viet Cong would also take advantage of the weather to leave the town. The rain continued. The children inside the temple outbuilding were running around, playing. Perhaps an hour or more after it had begun, the rain stopped. The wind began to clear the clouds. A small observation aircraft circling in the north-eastern sky began an approach. Dipping low above the treeline behind the temple, it fired two phosphorous rockets that spewed white smoke upon impact. Immediately, several government soldiers ran out from a building outside the temple gates onto the temple grounds and popped violet- and mustard-coloured smoke grenades. The colourless smoke fired by the observation plane marked the enemy; the coloured smoke, popped by those on the ground, identified the South Vietnamese forward position. Perhaps 150 yards separated the opposing positions. What happened next was up to the pilots on the bombing missions. An argument broke out among the soldiers inside the outbuilding, apparently about the meaning of the smoke. Suddenly, they turned to the villagers and told them to get out of the temple: it was about to be attacked.</p> <p>Kim Phuc's father Phan Tung assembled his children and their cousins, instructing them all to make for the 'American base'. He sent out the smallest and oldest first, Kim Phuc's grandmother and her aunt Anh, who was carrying her nine-month-old son. Next, he sent out the middle children, including Kim Phuc and two of her brothers. Then, the oldest siblings. Some of the panicking soldiers had already run out with the first of the villagers. Others who remained behind shouted at the stragglers to run fast, or they would die. Phan Tung and Kim's mother Nu were among the last to go with their baby niece.</p> <p>The 30 to 40 soldiers and civilians sketched a ragged line from the outbuilding, past the side and front of the temple, through its main gate and onto Route 1. How they appeared from the air through the lens of a dirty, partly clearing sky is debatable.</p> <p>Nick Ut looked at his watch. It was well after one o'clock. I have one good shot already, he told himself, crouching low as a South Vietnamese Skyraider approached. Then, changing his mind, he scrambled out of the embankment and onto the road. He decided to get a couple more then go home.</p> <p>Quickly, it became apparent that the plane was off course and had crossed into government lines. Instead of aborting his run, the pilot dipped into a dive and dropped two bombs. No explosion came; the bombs were duds. Some moments later, a second Skyraider came in on an approach even more off-target than the first. It dipped in a kind of corkscrew motion, a manoeuvre normally used when under fire.The soldiers and journalists at the bridge flattened themselves to the ground.</p> <p>Ut did not move from the road. He kept his camera lens trained. The plane dipped so low that anyone on the road could plainly see its South Vietnamese identification, red stripes on yellow. There was an unwritten 'rule of engagement' that the Americans had established early in the war: no fire was to be directed at unarmed Vietnamese unless they were running. Anyone running could be assumed to be Viet Cong fleeing attack, and thus fair game. Nick followed the code of conduct when covering combat during a bombing run: stand still, and lift your face towards the pilot.</p> <p>Once the bombs had fallen from the Skyraider, Nick composed his shot: silhouetted figures in uniform on the road in the foreground; the temple against an expanse of sky as the background. He had time. Hard bombs drop heavily, but the lighter napalm canisters tumble end over end, making forward progress as they head towards the ground.</p> <p>The napalm ignited on impact in a fierce explosive splash across the highway and the fields on either side. Flame shot upwards. Shades of saffron, blood, fire and sunset filled the viewfinder. Nick was sorry that he was shooting black-and white instead of colour.</p> <p>Even from a distance of several hundred yards, the blast of heat was immense. Fire rolled out of the treetops. Heavy, dirty black smoke swirled upwards. Gradually, as ash rained down, the scene was repainted in shades of grey. Faint shouts and screams could be heard.</p> <p>The first discernible figures were a half dozen or so women and children and a small black dog. A boy carried a child on his hip; two girls clutched jute sacks. Two stragglers appeared. One woman was ahead of the other, on the left edge of the road; the second woman was on the right, by habit, keeping out of the way of vehicles. She carried a baby, its face and scalp smudged black, facing forwards. Its eyes were open but its body was limp in the woman's arms and with every flat-footed step she took charred skin flapped or fell from the child's limbs.</p> <p>The photographers knew this was the day's picture. They clicked frame after frame until there was no film in their cameras. Already they were thinking of the editing, of finding the frame that separated life from death. The living better convey the horror of war; the dead have no expression.</p> <p>Kim Phuc had fallen a step or two behind her two brothers. Once she had reached the highway, she heard the drone of a low-flying plane, and, curious, turned her head to look. She had never before seen a plane so close. Without breaking her stride, she watched it drop four bombs before it passed from sight.</p> <p>A minute later, Phuc was struck with such force from behind that she fell face first to the ground. At first, she felt unafraid, only curious. She did not realise what was happening until she was enveloped by fire. Then fear took over. Later, she would have no recollection of getting to her feet and pulling at the neck of her burning clothes, nor that what was left of them fell away. Her first memory was of flames licking her left arm, where there was an ugly, brownish-black gob of burnt flesh. She tried to brush it off, only to scream out at the pain of the burn that had now spread to the inside of her other hand.</p> <p>Kim had taken a hit of napalm to her left side, on her upper body. It incinerated her ponytail, burnt her neck, almost all of her back and her left arm. She knew she should keep running, but intense fatigue and weariness overtook her, and she felt desperately thirsty. There were still a few hundred yards to go to safety.</p> <p>Her brother (on her right in Ut's picture) pulled at Phuc to help keep her on her feet. Some photographers, having used the last frames in their cameras on the old lady and the child, had begun to rewind their films and reload. Leicas and Nikons in those days were finicky, and unless rewinding and reloading were done slowly, they could easily jam.

      "bodyText": "Phan Thi Kim Phuc pulled back a corner of the curtain at the bedroom window. It was the only window in her tiny flat from which you could see further than the side wall of the house next door. If she had looked up over the roofs of Chinatown, where she lived, she could have seen Toronto's modern downtown skyline, but she wasn't thinking about the view. She scanned the pavement for anybody watching, then looked down at the uncovered porch below: nobody. But the evidence remained: a crushed drink can and the red-and-white carton of a Kentucky Fried Chicken lunch from the branch at the top of the street. The previous evening, she and her husband, Toan Bui, believing they had entered their apartment unseen by coming up the back stairs, had looked from this window, and noticing the can and carton, realised the two women they had just met on the street had been staking out their flat for some time that day, at least long enough to get hungry. One of them had a camera. Kim had cautioned her husband against opening the front door to put out the rubbish. How did the two women know her address? Why had they been waiting outside all day? The day came to an end, marking the beginning of the weekend, when Kim's solicitor's office would be closed. By Sunday, she was relieved to be able to go to church in Ajax, an hour away from Toronto. Since she and her husband were the only Vietnamese in the congregation, it seemed unlikely her past would ever come up. But after the service, when she and Toan went to collect their 11-month-old son Thomas from the cr\u00e9che, one of the priests told them Kim's picture was in the newspaper. He held up a Toronto tabloid. 'The photograph that shocked the world' said the headline, above a picture of a young girl, naked and running in terror. There was another headline, 'Child of war is a woman living in Toronto' alongside another picture, one of Kim, wearing the coat she'd been wearing all week. Clearly, the two women had got the photograph they'd come looking for. 'Yes,' Kim told the priest, 'I am the girl in the picture.' The newspaper that broke the story - that the subject of one of the most famous images from the Vietnam war now lived in the West - was the Mail on Sunday. The date was 19 March 1995. Toronto's Sunday Sun bought the story and ran it across pages two and three. Accompanying the article were photographs of Kim and Toan pushing their baby in a buggy along a Toronto street, and of Kim's parents in front of their mud hut in Trang Bang, Vietnam. The story was picked up by the international wire services. Within a couple of days, Kim's phone began to ring, and didn't stop. The doorbell rang almost constantly. Kim grew afraid to leave the house. She hardly slept and, exhausted, spent entire days in her dressing grown. This was not the scenario she had contemplated when, a few months earlier, she had decided that, in order to support the family, she would re-emerge from her secret life and sell her story; it would be her 'work'. She had gone for advice to Nancy Pocock, a long-time adviser to Vietnamese refugees in Canada, who knew a prominent Toronto entertainment lawyer. Before making the introduction, Pocock had wanted to make certain that Kim understood something: once she invited publicity, there would be no going back. Kim had accepted this, but a month on she was having second thoughts. She worried that newspapers would get the story and pictures of her without paying a penny. She felt as though she was becoming a victim all over again. She told her husband: 'It's like another bomb falling out of the sky.' Trang Bang, 5 June 1972 Communist troops have broken through Route 1, the highway running northwest from Saigon and over the border of South Vietnam with Cambodia to Phnom Penh, and are occupying the market place in Trang Bang. Soldiers from the US-backed South Vietnamese army have been called in and a bloody bombardment has begun. The villagers have abandoned their homes and moved into the nearby Codai temple. They think the holy place will be safe from 'the fire which falls from heaven'. On the morning of 8 June 1972 Associated Press photographer Nick Ut and his driver approached Trang Bang on Route 1. Refugees were clogging the road, heading east. Women carried babies, men shouldered poles balancing clothing and pots and pans, children carried babies and led water buffalo on ropes. The old and injured rode on oxcarts. Heavy smoke hung in the air above Trang Bang and planes were circling. The sound of Soviet- and Chinese-produced weapons confirmed the presence of North Vietnamese soldiers. Just outside the town, traffic was stopped behind concertina barbed wire stretched across the road. Ut flashed his pass to the military police, identifying himself as a journalist. He could go no farther than the small elevated bridge. As the morning progressed, more than a dozen foreign newsmen arrived. There were television crews from NBC and ITN and at least three other photographers. Three British journalists, among them William Shawcross for the Sunday Times, arrived by chance: the roadblock had waylaid their plans to take a sight-seeing trip to the Holy See. A senior officer from the South Vietnamese army told the journalists that the objective on this third day of fighting was to drive the Viet Cong into the treeline, and therefore out of town, so the highway could be reopened. The plan was to launch a ground assault with air support. Two or three times that morning, South Vietnamese planes came in on bombing runs. Ground assaults followed: government soldiers, moving in single file, swung in wide arcs through waist-high grass in the fields. Nick got shots of planes coming in. He shot soldiers on their bellies aiming grenade-launchers and firing machine guns, and soldiers rushing out the wounded on stretchers. These were images he had recorded hundreds of times before. The crowd at the roadblock, many of whom had been there three days, was like an audience at an air show. At the sound of an approaching aircraft, they would stand, transfixed, and then gaze at the explosion and fires half a mile away. In between times, a boy peddled ice-cream cones from his bicycle to the line of stalled traffic. Some of the crowd crouched in the shade of their vehicles, snacked on bananas and savoured the sticky, sweet pulp of the last of the star apples of the season. Sometimes, during the lulls, the crowd caught sight of uniformed North Vietnamese soldiers dragging wounded colleagues to safety. It was the first time many had seen 'soldiers from Hanoi'. Reassured by their presence they agreed that it was unthinkable that either the Communists or the government would attack a holy place. Late that morning the clouds had formed a low-lying blanket and the typical afternoon downpour of the wettest summer months began. The photographers and television cameramen covered their equipment with army-issue rain ponchos. The photographers looked about to see if anyone was thinking about calling it a day: the cloud cover would mean a halt in air strikes and, therefore, ground assaults. They compared notes about what 'today's picture' would be: refugees on the road, people fleeing the town. Ut took his lunch of French cheese and baguette from his camera bag. He decided to leave by 2pm, because of the heavy refugee traffic. One o'clock came and went without a break in the cloud cover. Some of his colleagues left, presuming that the Viet Cong would also take advantage of the weather to leave the town. The rain continued. The children inside the temple outbuilding were running around, playing. Perhaps an hour or more after it had begun, the rain stopped. The wind began to clear the clouds. A small observation aircraft circling in the north-eastern sky began an approach. Dipping low above the treeline behind the temple, it fired two phosphorous rockets that spewed white smoke upon impact. Immediately, several government soldiers ran out from a building outside the temple gates onto the temple grounds and popped violet- and mustard-coloured smoke grenades. The colourless smoke fired by the observation plane marked the enemy; the coloured smoke, popped by those on the ground, identified the South Vietnamese forward position. Perhaps 150 yards separated the opposing positions. What happened next was up to the pilots on the bombing missions. An argument broke out among the soldiers inside the outbuilding, apparently about the meaning of the smoke. Suddenly, they turned to the villagers and told them to get out of the temple: it was about to be attacked. Kim Phuc's father Phan Tung assembled his children and their cousins, instructing them all to make for the 'American base'. He sent out the smallest and oldest first, Kim Phuc's grandmother and her aunt Anh, who was carrying her nine-month-old son. Next, he sent out the middle children, including Kim Phuc and two of her brothers. Then, the oldest siblings. Some of the panicking soldiers had already run out with the first of the villagers. Others who remained behind shouted at the stragglers to run fast, or they would die. Phan Tung and Kim's mother Nu were among the last to go with their baby niece. The 30 to 40 soldiers and civilians sketched a ragged line from the outbuilding, past the side and front of the temple, through its main gate and onto Route 1. How they appeared from the air through the lens of a dirty, partly clearing sky is debatable. Nick Ut looked at his watch. It was well after one o'clock. I have one good shot already, he told himself, crouching low as a South Vietnamese Skyraider approached. Then, changing his mind, he scrambled out of the embankment and onto the road. He decided to get a couple more then go home. Quickly, it became apparent that the plane was off course and had crossed into government lines. Instead of aborting his run, the pilot dipped into a dive and dropped two bombs. No explosion came; the bombs were duds. Some moments later, a second Skyraider came in on an approach even more off-target than the first. It dipped in a kind of corkscrew motion, a manoeuvre normally used when under fire.The soldiers and journalists at the bridge flattened themselves to the ground. Ut did not move from the road. He kept his camera lens trained. The plane dipped so low that anyone on the road could plainly see its South Vietnamese identification, red stripes on yellow. There was an unwritten 'rule of engagement' that the Americans had established early in the war: no fire was to be directed at unarmed Vietnamese unless they were running. Anyone running could be assumed to be Viet Cong fleeing attack, and thus fair game. Nick followed the code of conduct when covering combat during a bombing run: stand still, and lift your face towards the pilot. Once the bombs had fallen from the Skyraider, Nick composed his shot: silhouetted figures in uniform on the road in the foreground; the temple against an expanse of sky as the background. He had time. Hard bombs drop heavily, but the lighter napalm canisters tumble end over end, making forward progress as they head towards the ground. The napalm ignited on impact in a fierce explosive splash across the highway and the fields on either side. Flame shot upwards. Shades of saffron, blood, fire and sunset filled the viewfinder. Nick was sorry that he was shooting black-and white instead of colour. Even from a distance of several hundred yards, the blast of heat was immense. Fire rolled out of the treetops. Heavy, dirty black smoke swirled upwards. Gradually, as ash rained down, the scene was repainted in shades of grey. Faint shouts and screams could be heard. The first discernible figures were a half dozen or so women and children and a small black dog. A boy carried a child on his hip; two girls clutched jute sacks. Two stragglers appeared. One woman was ahead of the other, on the left edge of the road; the second woman was on the right, by habit, keeping out of the way of vehicles. She carried a baby, its face and scalp smudged black, facing forwards. Its eyes were open but its body was limp in the woman's arms and with every flat-footed step she took charred skin flapped or fell from the child's limbs. The photographers knew this was the day's picture. They clicked frame after frame until there was no film in their cameras. Already they were thinking of the editing, of finding the frame that separated life from death. The living better convey the horror of war; the dead have no expression. Kim Phuc had fallen a step or two behind her two brothers. Once she had reached the highway, she heard the drone of a low-flying plane, and, curious, turned her head to look. She had never before seen a plane so close. Without breaking her stride, she watched it drop four bombs before it passed from sight. A minute later, Phuc was struck with such force from behind that she fell face first to the ground. At first, she felt unafraid, only curious. She did not realise what was happening until she was enveloped by fire. Then fear took over. Later, she would have no recollection of getting to her feet and pulling at the neck of her burning clothes, nor that what was left of them fell away. Her first memory was of flames licking her left arm, where there was an ugly, brownish-black gob of burnt flesh. She tried to brush it off, only to scream out at the pain of the burn that had now spread to the inside of her other hand. Kim had taken a hit of napalm to her left side, on her upper body. It incinerated her ponytail, burnt her neck, almost all of her back and her left arm. She knew she should keep running, but intense fatigue and weariness overtook her, and she felt desperately thirsty. There were still a few hundred yards to go to safety. Her brother (on her right in Ut's picture) pulled at Phuc to help keep her on her feet. Some photographers, having used the last frames in their cameras on the old lady and the child, had begun to rewind their films and reload. Leicas and Nikons in those days were finicky, and unless rewinding and reloading were done slowly, they could easily jam. Others among the journalists had turned their minds to making haste for Saigon. None thought there was anyone left to walk out of the flames. Then Kim Phuc came running, naked, screaming out of the flames, her arms held limply outwards. Her cry pierced the silence. ' Nong qua, nong qua! ' ['It's too hot, too hot!'] Nick Ut was among those who ran forward. He reached for the last of four cameras he had in his bag. Keeping a loaded camera in reserve was a quirk of his. Christopher Wain, an ITN journalist, put his hand out to bring Kim to a stop. From behind, the extent of her burn was already apparent. Her body radiated heat, and chunks of pink and black flesh were peeling off. Someone put a canteen of water to her lips. Other soldiers began to empty theirs over her still burning flesh. Nick went to get a poncho to cover the girl's nakedness. Realising they would have transport, Phan Tung begged the journalists to take his daughter to hospital. The nearest one was in Cu Chi, on the way to Saigon. Nick Ut, shaking at what he had witnessed, thought about his deadline and about the competition from UPI. He felt torn between trying to do the humane thing and getting back to Saigon as quickly as possible. It was getting dangerously late.

      "body": "<p>The TI Group, one of the best-known names in British engineering, has been talking to the US aerospace firm BF Goodrich about a \u00a32.5 billion merger. </p> <p>The American firm approached the UK group after a review carried out by TI chairman Sir Christopher Lewington in response to its languishing share price. During the process, which began in May, TI is also understood to have held talks with British engineering rival BBA. </p> <p>Goodrich is still best-known for its high-performance tyres, a business sold to Michelin in the late Eighties. Nowadays, with annual sales of \u00a34bn, it is a leading manufacturer of aircraft components, polymers, industrial seals, compressors and diesel and gas engines. </p> <p>TI, with sales of nearly \u00a33bn, is a world leader in motor components, aircraft engine parts and industrial sealing systems. </p> <p>Sources close to the group said the talks, involving Lewington, started during the summer. Working parties from both firms have explored the commercial aspects of a merger. A price of between 450p and 500p for each TI share has been discussed, sources say, valuing TI at up to \u00a32.5bn - a premium of over 30 per cent to the group's current 343p price. </p> <p>TI declined to comment on the talks. 'You would expect us to have conversations with companies all the time,' a TI spokesman said. 'There are a number of discussions we have had with companies in our peer group.'

      "bodyText": "The TI Group, one of the best-known names in British engineering, has been talking to the US aerospace firm BF Goodrich about a \u00a32.5 billion merger. The American firm approached the UK group after a review carried out by TI chairman Sir Christopher Lewington in response to its languishing share price. During the process, which began in May, TI is also understood to have held talks with British engineering rival BBA. Goodrich is still best-known for its high-performance tyres, a business sold to Michelin in the late Eighties. Nowadays, with annual sales of \u00a34bn, it is a leading manufacturer of aircraft components, polymers, industrial seals, compressors and diesel and gas engines. TI, with sales of nearly \u00a33bn, is a world leader in motor components, aircraft engine parts and industrial sealing systems. Sources close to the group said the talks, involving Lewington, started during the summer. Working parties from both firms have explored the commercial aspects of a merger. A price of between 450p and 500p for each TI share has been discussed, sources say, valuing TI at up to \u00a32.5bn - a premium of over 30 per cent to the group's current 343p price. TI declined to comment on the talks. 'You would expect us to have conversations with companies all the time,' a TI spokesman said. 'There are a number of discussions we have had with companies in our peer group.' Goodrich could not be contacted. TI insiders, however, confirmed that an approach had been made by the US firm, which is ambitious for further growth. 'There are obviously synergies with Goodrich,' one TI source said, 'but the problems we have had in all talks is that we operate in three markets: aerospace, industrial and automotive. Very few other firms span the whole range of our activities.' At TI's interim results last month, Lewington said he was considering all options, including taking the firm private, in response to the group's share price slump. Like many engineers, TI has seen its shares nearly halve over the last year. However, Lewington is known to be cautious, and eager not to repeat the disastrous type of merger that rival Lucas struck with Varity of the US. That led to US control by the back door. US buyout specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts holds a 4.7 per cent stake in TI. Following a series of deals, however, TI now has \u00a31bn of debt, and analysts believe a buyout would be difficult. To fund future growth TI is also expected to have to sell one of its four divisions. A merger with Goodrich could lead to spin-offs, possibly including motor components, which would be highly attractive to international rivals. Under Lewington, TI has transformed itself over the last 15 years, shedding businesses such as Raleigh cycles, Russell Hobbs and Creda. Goodrich, based in North Carolina, has been through a similar shake-up under chairman David Burner and, like TI, has been acquisitive. Last year it bought US rival Coltech for \u00a31.5bn.",

      "body": "<p>Listen: I don't care if they're French or Dutch or Taiwanese. If they're good, and they want to play for Arsenal (hello, Nicolas!), they're welcome. A recent newspaper columnist suspected that the average football fan was unable to 'relate to' the average foreign import, but ask anyone at Highbury whether they could 'relate to' Jimmy Carter, Steve Morrow, David Hillier, Vince Bartram, Eddie McGoldrick, Ian Selley, Andy Linighan, Colin Pates, John Hartson and Chris Kiwomya I personally couldn't relate to any of them, but a relationship was foisted on me anyway, through George Graham's side of the family, and they embarrassed me frequently, at weddings, parties and home games.</p> <p>Now, Tony Adams Everyone in the Clock End relates to him. But why? Is it because he comes from Essex? Is it because he used to drink himself stupid? Is it because he was sent to prison? Is it because he stopped drinking and started going to the theatre? Is it because he cares enough about his fellow professionals to want to set up a clinic for those who, like him, have addiction problems? Did you relate to him more then, or now? (After all, and contrary to the message of the popular song, there have been two Tony Adamses.) Or is it because he's been fantastic for a decade-and-a-half now? The answer is obvious, and it's got very little to do with his nationality - Patrick Vieira enjoys exactly the same relationship with the Arsenal fans - and everything to do with his character. Or characters</p> <p>The recent TV documentary about David Elleray, Martin Edwards's favourite referee, was terrifying in all sorts of ways. (Have you ever met a kid who collected newspaper cuttings about refs, as the boy Elleray did? And did he really say that being a housemaster at Harrow was 'the best job in the world'?) But the moment in the programme that would have chilled Tony Adams came when Elleray was wired for sound, back at the end of the Eighties, an ill-advised experiment that was never repeated. </p> <p>It was Elleray's misfortune to be officiating a match involving Millwall and George Graham's Arsenal, a group of players who liked to spend 90 minutes buzzing angrily round the referee like red and white wasps. (If the 10-yard dissent rule had existed back then, there would have been quite a few free-kicks floated back into the Arsenal penalty-area from the top of Muswell Hill.) And it was Elleray's double misfortune to wave play on after the ball had clearly crossed Millwall's goal line, thus denying Arsenal an equaliser. The resulting furore made the back pages of the newspapers, and it was Tony Adams's words - he called Elleray a 'cheat' - that were heard the clearest.</p> <p>It's the face, though, rather than the words, that strike you now. It was a face that was consumed by football, and, specifically at that moment, by football's injustices - the mouth is a round 'o' of incomprehension, the brows are furrowed with anxiety. There's not, in truth, much going on there, beyond the desire to win a cup-tie at the Den.</p> <p>Look at the 21st century Adams, on or off the pitch, and you can see a man with a life outside the game. This alarms some fans, and it is easy to see why: you don't pay good money to see a centre-back's complicated interior life. You pay to watch him head a corner away - an action which, if done repeatedly over many years, would seem to actively prevent a complicated interior life. In other words: if a man has discovered the joys of music and literature and sobriety, can he still be bothered to fling himself at Duncan Ferguson?</p> <p>When I ask Adams about the game at Millwall, the first two sentences of his answer reflect what must go on in him all the time. 'I was very, very emotional, wasn't I?' he says immediately. This is the Adams we have become accustomed to over the past four years - calm, rational, slightly baffled and repelled by his previous excesses. And then he laughs. 'But it did fucking cross the line, didn't it?'</p> <p>The fan in me breathes a sigh of relief. He hasn't forgotten that, in the appropriate circumstances, these things matter. He restates the terms of the conflict. 'I've got a great photo at home of me at Selhurst Park. It's in three stages, and I'm going mad at the referee, and my face I look at it and think, \"Jesus Christ, I don't know that person. What is going on in his life?\" It's quite frightening. I keep it in case I'm ever tempted to change my ways.' </p> <p>But he is at pains to point out that what he is reacting to in the photo is a penalty that has been given against him for 'a great tackle in our box, clean as a whistle. I've got that pride, and it had been punctured'. I remind him that he had been unhappy with the penalty awarded to Barcelona in the Champions League game at Wembley last season, and he smiles. 'Yes, and I think I expressed myself quite powerfully. I mean, I'm not going to say, \"Yes, referee, that was a penalty, you are correct.\" But, you know, I didn't get booked for dissent.'</p> <p>So it's all about balance, in a profession where balance is notoriously difficult - and maybe even beside the point. It is fair to say that balance is not a quality one associated with the old Tony Adams, in a physical or emotional sense. He lost his temper, he drank too much, he fell down stairs, he dropped fellow professionals on to the Wembley turf from a great height If it is part of a defender's job to learn to stay on his feet, then it is a wisdom that has, through a variety of circumstances, been harder for Adams to acquire than for most people. This, of course, is what makes him such an impressive and entirely admirable figure now: nothing has come easy for him.</p> <p>I had a theory that the spangly new Premiership, with its cerebral French managers and its pony-tails and its dietary regimes, is a more comfortable environment for the new Adams than the old First Division would have been. It is difficult to imagine that the team Adams broke into (which contained Charlie Nicholas, Kenny Sansom and several other players who were not, it is probably fair to say, teetotal bibliophiles) would have been terribly sympathetic to the character that has emerged since his treatment for alcohol addiction four years ago. And it is equally difficult to imagine that Manu Petit or Thierry Henry would be very challenged by the idea that going to the theatre is as pleasant a way of spending an evening as drinking gallons of Guinness and tumbling down nightclub stairs. </p> <p>When I attempt to put this to Adams, though, he is mildly - and, I suspect, artfully - resistant to the idea that there is a new Premiership culture. 'I think players are players, and I know some players, French, Spanish, whatever, who can put loads and loads of bottles of wine down their necks.'</p> <p>He is also at pains to point out that players thought about their refuelling strategies long before the arrival of M Wenger. 'Back in '86, '87, Steve Williams and Paul Davis and me were reading a book by Robert Hess called Eat to Win, and, you know, that's what we were doing, chewing for victory' </p> <p>But after you'd read the book you went down to the pub and drank 10 pints? </p> <p>'Exactly, it was going out of the window.' As if this were only a minor obstruction to the mid-Eighties dietary revolution. But what about the, you know, the books and plays and stuff? Isn't it easier to talk about that at work? He shrugs. 'I recommended the play Art to Lee Dixon and his wife, and we had a good chat about that afterwards.' Lee Dixon? Lee Dixon? Proof, if any were needed, that there is little correlation between an ability to cross the ball and an appreciation of contemporary theatre.</p> <p>But Adams does accept that his new lifestyle and interests raise the odd eyebrow. I tell him a story I'd heard about a friend of a friend, an Arsenal supporter and actor who was appearing in a play about Freud at the Bush Theatre. When he stepped out onto the stage and saw the Arsenal captain sitting in the front row he almost lost it. 'Yeah, people do seem to have a problem with it. I was at the opera last week and this old lady She nearly rugby-tackled me. \"I didn't expect to see you here! What are you doing here!\"'</p> <p>Adams seems anxious to dispel the notion that only in the past three or four years - since the arrival of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and sobriety - has he reached his full potential as a player. I remember an article by Simon Barnes in the Times, shortly after Arsenal had won the Championship in 1998, in which Barnes had wondered whether Adams was revelling in the football that Wenger allowed and encouraged him to play, or whether the player simply regretted that so much of his career had been spent serving George Graham's particular brand of pragmatism. </p> <p>But actually Adams talks with some relish about the old Arsenal - partly, it seems, because the inadequacies of Graham's team in its later years gave him the opportunity to do what he does best - defend. 'What about the Cup-Winners Cup final in '94? Jesus Christ, we went there with a nothing team, you know? If you compare the squad we have now with the squad we had then And Paris St Germain here, in the semi-final.' He nods towards the window of his Highbury box above the Clock End. 'Weah, Ginola, they didn't get a kick.' (That might not be how they remember the evening, incidentally - especially Ginola, who I recall got several kicks.)</p> <p>He feels that the Championship-winning team of '91 was every bit as good as the '98 team, and regrets that it didn't go on to do more - a failure that he admits was in part due to 'the way we were living outside the game'. And he sets the against-all-odds triumph of the '94 side against the bitterly disappointing Uefa Cup final defeat of last season, when an Arsenal team containing Henry, Kanu, Bergkamp, Petit, Overmars and Vieira (as opposed to Morrow, Selley, Jensen, Smith, Campbell et al) scarcely created a chance.</p> <p>'I said to Ars\u00e8ne before the game, \"I'm very worried.\" Because there were a few people who weren't at the races because of the Double - a few cracks had started to appear, and it's all about who wants it more, isn't it? But hopefully we've got rid of those people now.' </p> <p>And he laughs knowingly. For those who don't have an intimate knowledge of Arsenal's recent history, Marc Overmars of Holland and Emmanuel Petit of France were transferred to Barcelona over the summer; one suspects that it may well be these two who were not race-goers.</p> <p>I have good memories of '94, too - and of the same games. But there weren't very many of them, and it's hard to recall a decent league game at Highbury in Graham's last three seasons. (Carter, Hillier, Kiwom No. I can't go through that list again.) The most consistent pleasure any Arsenal side has given me came in that '97/98 season, and before I met Adams I had a vague dread that he would elevate the pre-Wenger years into a mythical time of solid achievement, and denigrate the current squad, write them off as talented but uncommitted foreigners. (I remember Adams once saying that he enjoyed the England get-togethers partly because 'everyone speaks English'.) </p> <p>But it's clear too that he adores his current manager, and that his recollection of the Graham years is not pure nostalgia. (He refers sadly at one stage in our conversation to playing 'with a lot of fear'.) 'Ars\u00e8ne's a gift, he really is a gift. He's got his faults, like all of us, but he's a pure joy to work for. I play for him now, and if I didn't have him I wouldn't be at Arsenal.' </p> <p>The very idea of Adams being anywhere else is alarming. How close did he come to leaving? 'I don't think during my drinking days I had the ability to move away. I think I was stuck. There was so much going on outside, and I was so fearful of the manager that I wouldn't dare rock the boat. But around the time I sobered up, and I got a bit of courage and self-worth I did have the ability to move on then if I needed to, but just at the right time, Ars\u00e8ne was sent'</p> <p>He talks about Wenger's obsessive devotion to the game with affectionate bemusement : 'When we were on pre-season training in Germany, he set his alarm for three in the morning so he could watch the Brazil World Cup qualifier live. Wouldn't watch it on video. And then he says at breakfast, [Adams does one of the worst cod-French accents I have ever heard, incidentally] \"Oh, Tonee, I am very tired zis morning.'''</p> <p>And, interestingly, given his earlier approving comments about the removal of the rogue elements within the camp over the summer, he pays an elaborate and intriguing compliment to the talents and character of Emmanuel Petit.</p> <p>'He's a very, very insecure boy, I think, deep down. I think he's misunderstood, very misunderstood. I think his ability is phenomenal. Defensively he was fantastic, he knew how to play, he had a good football brain, he could pass the ball I'm going to miss him. I wanted him to play for Arsenal and I think it's unfortunate he's not playing now.'</p> <p> But does Adams think he'll miss us? 'Sure. Yeah. I think he enjoyed playing here, I think he liked the atmosphere, he loved London, and he loved his team-mates. Whether the team-mates actually loved him' And Tony laughs enigmatically. Curiouser and curiouser.</p> <p>Like most people in the English game, he has his worries about the foreign invasion, but his argument makes more sense, and is more pragmatic, than anything I have heard from Kevin Keegan or Alan Hansen. 'My little boy, if he wants a career in football, I'm going to have to say to him, \"Maybe it might be better to go and play football in France. Go and learn your trade at Nantes or one of these clubs, 'cos you'll be playing first-team football and then you'll probably get a decent move to an English club.\" The kids coming through at the moment are finding it very difficult because of the amount of foreigners and because of the quality of the League.' </p> <p>This second reason is the main cause of the problem, of course: fans of big Premiership clubs want a strong England team, but their immediate concern is Liverpool away next Saturday, and most of them would rather see Batistuta up front than an 18-year-old who may or may not make it. 'Sure. I think that the foreigners are great from a supporter's point of view. I'm talking from an England point of view here, that's all I'm talking about. I think we could go backwards if we're not careful.'</p> <p>It's all coming to an end, now, the Adams era, although the vigour with which he has started the new season suggests that the last game may be a little further away than we thought. He's certainly more upbeat about the new season than the many Arsenal fans who were worried about the lack of transfer activity in the summer. 'I'm very confident and optimistic about this squad. We could do with a couple of new players, maybe. A forward, perhaps a centre-back, but I think the manager knows that. But the atmosphere's wonderful, and the squad as it is at the moment, between you and me, is very resilient and tough, and I think we're going to do all right.'</p> <p>I tell him that half the Arsenal crowd expect him to be the next manager, and he nearly chokes on his biscuit. ('I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do anything, so I'm going to have a custard cream when I want and bugger you.' This, clearly, is what passes for ill-discipline in the puritan Wenger regime.)</p> <p>'You know, I struggle with the boss at times on this one. I have to remember that I'm still a player and the club captain and that's it, and I have to let him pick the team from time to time But the only way I'd stay in the game is as manager of a football club. I'm a bit of a control freak, so I wouldn't want to do any other job.' In other words, it's looking likely, then - but not yet.</p> <p>'I spoke to Platty and he was talking about Vialli, how he really regrets not taking some time out, and I think he might do it at the end of the year. I think this might be his last season, because if he's unsuccessful they'll get rid of him anyway. So I think I'd like some time off before I thought about it. I'm not saying I'll be a better manager when I'm 55, but by the time I've wrapped up here it'll be 22 years, and that involves a lot of sacrifices, a lot of things I haven't done....I can't go skiing in the winter like a lot of people can. I'd like a proper Christmas Day with the kids. Play some party games, watch an old black-and-white film That all sounds wonderful. And don't get me wrong, it's been wonderful, and the pay-offs have been unbelievable, worth the sacrifice. But it has been a sacrifice....'</p> <p>I think that he, of all footballers, knows how much it has been appreciated.</p>",

Proof, if any were needed, that there is little correlation between an ability to cross the ball and an appreciation of contemporary theatre. But Adams does accept that his new lifestyle and interests raise the odd eyebrow. I tell him a story I'd heard about a friend of a friend, an Arsenal supporter and actor who was appearing in a play about Freud at the Bush Theatre. When he stepped out onto the stage and saw the Arsenal captain sitting in the front row he almost lost it. 'Yeah, people do seem to have a problem with it. I was at the opera last week and this old lady She nearly rugby-tackled me. \"I didn't expect to see you here! What are you doing here!\"' Adams seems anxious to dispel the notion that only in the past three or four years - since the arrival of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger and sobriety - has he reached his full potential as a player. I remember an article by Simon Barnes in the Times, shortly after Arsenal had won the Championship in 1998, in which Barnes had wondered whether Adams was revelling in the football that Wenger allowed and encouraged him to play, or whether the player simply regretted that so much of his career had been spent serving George Graham's particular brand of pragmatism. But actually Adams talks with some relish about the old Arsenal - partly, it seems, because the inadequacies of Graham's team in its later years gave him the opportunity to do what he does best - defend. 'What about the Cup-Winners Cup final in '94? Jesus Christ, we went there with a nothing team, you know? If you compare the squad we have now with the squad we had then And Paris St Germain here, in the semi-final.' He nods towards the window of his Highbury box above the Clock End. 'Weah, Ginola, they didn't get a kick.' (That might not be how they remember the evening, incidentally - especially Ginola, who I recall got several kicks.) He feels that the Championship-winning team of '91 was every bit as good as the '98 team, and regrets that it didn't go on to do more - a failure that he admits was in part due to 'the way we were living outside the game'. And he sets the against-all-odds triumph of the '94 side against the bitterly disappointing Uefa Cup final defeat of last season, when an Arsenal team containing Henry, Kanu, Bergkamp, Petit, Overmars and Vieira (as opposed to Morrow, Selley, Jensen, Smith, Campbell et al) scarcely created a chance. 'I said to Ars\u00e8ne before the game, \"I'm very worried.\" Because there were a few people who weren't at the races because of the Double - a few cracks had started to appear, and it's all about who wants it more, isn't it? But hopefully we've got rid of those people now.' And he laughs knowingly. For those who don't have an intimate knowledge of Arsenal's recent history, Marc Overmars of Holland and Emmanuel Petit of France were transferred to Barcelona over the summer; one suspects that it may well be these two who were not race-goers. I have good memories of '94, too - and of the same games. But there weren't very many of them, and it's hard to recall a decent league game at Highbury in Graham's last three seasons. (Carter, Hillier, Kiwom No. I can't go through that list again.) The most consistent pleasure any Arsenal side has given me came in that '97/98 season, and before I met Adams I had a vague dread that he would elevate the pre-Wenger years into a mythical time of solid achievement, and denigrate the current squad, write them off as talented but uncommitted foreigners. (I remember Adams once saying that he enjoyed the England get-togethers partly because 'everyone speaks English'.) But it's clear too that he adores his current manager, and that his recollection of the Graham years is not pure nostalgia. (He refers sadly at one stage in our conversation to playing 'with a lot of fear'.) 'Ars\u00e8ne's a gift, he really is a gift. He's got his faults, like all of us, but he's a pure joy to work for. I play for him now, and if I didn't have him I wouldn't be at Arsenal.' The very idea of Adams being anywhere else is alarming. How close did he come to leaving? 'I don't think during my drinking days I had the ability to move away. I think I was stuck. There was so much going on outside, and I was so fearful of the manager that I wouldn't dare rock the boat. But around the time I sobered up, and I got a bit of courage and self-worth I did have the ability to move on then if I needed to, but just at the right time, Ars\u00e8ne was sent' He talks about Wenger's obsessive devotion to the game with affectionate bemusement : 'When we were on pre-season training in Germany, he set his alarm for three in the morning so he could watch the Brazil World Cup qualifier live. Wouldn't watch it on video. And then he says at breakfast, [Adams does one of the worst cod-French accents I have ever heard, incidentally] \"Oh, Tonee, I am very tired zis morning.''' And, interestingly, given his earlier approving comments about the removal of the rogue elements within the camp over the summer, he pays an elaborate and intriguing compliment to the talents and character of Emmanuel Petit. 'He's a very, very insecure boy, I think, deep down. I think he's misunderstood, very misunderstood. I think his ability is phenomenal. Defensively he was fantastic, he knew how to play, he had a good football brain, he could pass the ball I'm going to miss him. I wanted him to play for Arsenal and I think it's unfortunate he's not playing now.' But does Adams think he'll miss us? 'Sure. Yeah. I think he enjoyed playing here, I think he liked the atmosphere, he loved London, and he loved his team-mates. Whether the team-mates actually loved him' And Tony laughs enigmatically. Curiouser and curiouser. Like most people in the English game, he has his worries about the foreign invasion, but his argument makes more sense, and is more pragmatic, than anything I have heard from Kevin Keegan or Alan Hansen. 'My little boy, if he wants a career in football, I'm going to have to say to him, \"Maybe it might be better to go and play football in France. Go and learn your trade at Nantes or one of these clubs, 'cos you'll be playing first-team football and then you'll probably get a decent move to an English club.\" The kids coming through at the moment are finding it very difficult because of the amount of foreigners and because of the quality of the League.' This second reason is the main cause of the problem, of course: fans of big Premiership clubs want a strong England team, but their immediate concern is Liverpool away next Saturday, and most of them would rather see Batistuta up front than an 18-year-old who may or may not make it. 'Sure. I think that the foreigners are great from a supporter's point of view. I'm talking from an England point of view here, that's all I'm talking about. I think we could go backwards if we're not careful.' It's all coming to an end, now, the Adams era, although the vigour with which he has started the new season suggests that the last game may be a little further away than we thought. He's certainly more upbeat about the new season than the many Arsenal fans who were worried about the lack of transfer activity in the summer. 'I'm very confident and optimistic about this squad. We could do with a couple of new players, maybe. A forward, perhaps a centre-back, but I think the manager knows that. But the atmosphere's wonderful, and the squad as it is at the moment, between you and me, is very resilient and tough, and I think we're going to do all right.' I tell him that half the Arsenal crowd expect him to be the next manager, and he nearly chokes on his biscuit. ('I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't do anything, so I'm going to have a custard cream when I want and bugger you.' This, clearly, is what passes for ill-discipline in the puritan Wenger regime.) 'You know, I struggle with the boss at times on this one. I have to remember that I'm still a player and the club captain and that's it, and I have to let him pick the team from time to time But the only way I'd stay in the game is as manager of a football club. I'm a bit of a control freak, so I wouldn't want to do any other job.' In other words, it's looking likely, then - but not yet. 'I spoke to Platty and he was talking about Vialli, how he really regrets not taking some time out, and I think he might do it at the end of the year. I think this might be his last season, because if he's unsuccessful they'll get rid of him anyway. So I think I'd like some time off before I thought about it. I'm not saying I'll be a better manager when I'm 55, but by the time I've wrapped up here it'll be 22 years, and that involves a lot of sacrifices, a lot of things I haven't done....I can't go skiing in the winter like a lot of people can. I'd like a proper Christmas Day with the kids. Play some party games, watch an old black-and-white film That all sounds wonderful. And don't get me wrong, it's been wonderful, and the pay-offs have been unbelievable, worth the sacrifice. But it has been a sacrifice....' I think that he, of all footballers, knows how much it has been appreciated.",
