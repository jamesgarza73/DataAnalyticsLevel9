As a result, almost everyone knows that the New Yorker was edited for close on 60 years, from Prohibition to the Age of Greed, first by maverick Harold Ross and then by cryptic William Shawn (the 'Mr Shawn' of literary legend); and that at the beginning of the Nineties, it was taken over by S.I.

Why should anyone, outside the hectic avenues of Manhattan, care about the New Yorker? </p> <p>The short answer is that its urbane and irreverent weekly appearance makes it quite unlike any other ephemeral publication, with an authority unique in the history of magazine journalism. </p> <p>At its best, it has always had what New Yorker veteran Joseph Mitchell called, in a brilliant phrase, 'a wild exactitude'. On one occasion, when the American humorist E.B. White threatened to resign, Harold Ross, a restless, rasping shambles of a man, roared: 'You can't quit.

Perelman and Woody Allen, who pops up in the birthday issue. </p> <p>In the last quarter of the twentieth century, as London and Manhattan became nearly coterminous suburbs, the New Yorker became the first port of call for much British writing, too. And yet, though the magazine is now eagerly read by the metropolitan literary establishment in London, there remain important differences between its position in America and in Britain. </p> <p>First, only a highly mobile society scattered across millions of square miles would look to a weekly publication to provide a centre of literary excellence.

      "body": "<p><strong>The Maharajah's Box: an Imperial Story of Conspiracy, Love and a Guru's Prophecy</strong><br>Christy Campbell<br>HarperCollins \u00a319.99, pp474<br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502336326,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p> The origins of The Maharajah's Box are almost as curious as the tale it has to tell. In 1997, during the controversy over Switzerland's 'Nazi gold', the Swiss Bankers' Association published a list of more than 1,800 'dormant accounts' and other deposits untouched for the past half century. </p> <p>Though most had belonged to Jewish victims of the Holocaust, one of the unclaimed boxes in a Swiss bank vault was the property of an Indian princess who, improbably, was 'last heard of in 1942 living in Penn, Bucks'. </p> <p>The princess turned out to be the deceased daughter of Maharajah Duleep Singh, last Emperor of the Sikhs. 'Nazi Gold Fortune Awaits the Heirs of Maharajah,' ran the headline over a Sunday Telegraph article written by Christy Campbell soon after the publication of the Swiss bankers' list. </p> <p>Scores of applicants laid claim to the treasure. All were to be disappointed. Just as Campbell was finishing his book, he discovered that the maharajah's box was empty. The empty box, however, set Campbell on the trail of one of the most extraordinary characters in the history of the British Raj. </p> <p>As a nine-year-old in 1849, Duleep was coerced by the British into signing away his kingdom in the Punjab and giving the Koh-i-Noor, the world's most celebrated diamond, to Queen Victoria. His British guardian supervised his conversion to Christianity and removed him to Britain at the age of 15. Victoria, to whom Duleep was presented, found him 'handsome' with 'a pretty, graceful and dignified manner'. </p> <p>Duleep's tragedy was that for the rest of his life he never truly succeeded in either reconciling or choosing between his native and adopted cultures. He set up home at Elveden Hall in Suffolk, which he gave a flamboyantly mock-oriental interior and an even more flamboyant menagerie. Parrots flew around the house, apes occupied the kitchen garden, kangaroos hopped beneath the spreading cedars and missions were sent to India to bring back hawks for the mews. </p> <p>The Elveden estate became renowned for hunting parties which sometimes massacred more than 3,000 head of game in a single day. Duleep won a reputation as one of the best shots in Britain, as well as acquiring a string of mistresses and becoming an habitu\u00e9 of fashionable London salons. </p> <p>In his forties, however, Duleep began to fantasise about winning back his lost kingdom and became drawn into the Great Game being played out between the British Raj and Tsarist Russia on the North-West Frontier. Queen Victoria was sufficiently alarmed to write to him in 1886, complaining about 'extraordinary reports of your intending to transfer your allegiance to Russia! I cannot believe this of you who have always professed such loyalty and devotion towards me, who you know have always been your true friend and who I may say took a maternal interest in you from the time, when now 32 years ago, you came to England as a beautiful and charming Boy!' </p> <p>He sent an even more bizarre reply, admitting that he'd offered his services to Russia but begging 'to be permitted to subscribe myself your Majesty's most devoted humble servant'. </p> <p>Closely observed by British and Russian agents, Duleep made his way to Russia in 1887, announcing that, with Russian assistance, he would 'guarantee an easy conquest of India' and 'end the cruel yoke of British rule'. Though his plans caused some alarm in India, they were little more than fantasies. After less than a year, he left Russia for France and wrote to Queen Victoria, demanding the return of the Koh-i-Noor diamond which he intended to use to finance an Indian rebellion. In 1890, however, he was reduced to begging Queen Victoria's forgiveness, writing to her: 'I feel that in fighting against your country I have been fighting against God. I would return to England were I assured of your free pardon.' </p> <p>Campbell does not persuade me that Duleep played any significant part in the Great Game. He has, however, written a readable, entertaining and well-researched biography of a flamboyant but ultimately tragic figure caught between two cultures. </p> <p>For some members of Britain's Sikh community, Campbell's conclusions are bound to prove controversial. In July 1999, the Prince of Wales unveiled at Thetford an equestrian statue of Duleep, commissioned by the Maharajah Duleep Singh Centenary Trust. An inscription on the statue records: 'Even today, the Sikh nation aspires to regain its sovereignty', and says of Duleep: 'He died in Paris having re-embraced the Sikh faith while still engaged in a struggle to reclaim his throne.' </p> <p>Campbell shows, however, that in 1893 Duleep died a Christian. There was no Sikh cremation of his remains. Instead, his embalmed body was transported in a dark oak coffin across the Channel to a funeral in St Andrew's Church, Elveden, conducted by the rector. Among the wreaths was one from the Prince of Wales, inscribed 'For auld lang syne', and another from Balmoral marked simply 'From Queen Victoria'.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Maharajah's Box: an Imperial Story of Conspiracy, Love and a Guru's Prophecy Christy Campbell HarperCollins \u00a319.99, pp474 Buy it at BOL The origins of The Maharajah's Box are almost as curious as the tale it has to tell. In 1997, during the controversy over Switzerland's 'Nazi gold', the Swiss Bankers' Association published a list of more than 1,800 'dormant accounts' and other deposits untouched for the past half century. Though most had belonged to Jewish victims of the Holocaust, one of the unclaimed boxes in a Swiss bank vault was the property of an Indian princess who, improbably, was 'last heard of in 1942 living in Penn, Bucks'. The princess turned out to be the deceased daughter of Maharajah Duleep Singh, last Emperor of the Sikhs. 'Nazi Gold Fortune Awaits the Heirs of Maharajah,' ran the headline over a Sunday Telegraph article written by Christy Campbell soon after the publication of the Swiss bankers' list. Scores of applicants laid claim to the treasure. All were to be disappointed. Just as Campbell was finishing his book, he discovered that the maharajah's box was empty. The empty box, however, set Campbell on the trail of one of the most extraordinary characters in the history of the British Raj. As a nine-year-old in 1849, Duleep was coerced by the British into signing away his kingdom in the Punjab and giving the Koh-i-Noor, the world's most celebrated diamond, to Queen Victoria. His British guardian supervised his conversion to Christianity and removed him to Britain at the age of 15. Victoria, to whom Duleep was presented, found him 'handsome' with 'a pretty, graceful and dignified manner'. Duleep's tragedy was that for the rest of his life he never truly succeeded in either reconciling or choosing between his native and adopted cultures. He set up home at Elveden Hall in Suffolk, which he gave a flamboyantly mock-oriental interior and an even more flamboyant menagerie. Parrots flew around the house, apes occupied the kitchen garden, kangaroos hopped beneath the spreading cedars and missions were sent to India to bring back hawks for the mews. The Elveden estate became renowned for hunting parties which sometimes massacred more than 3,000 head of game in a single day. Duleep won a reputation as one of the best shots in Britain, as well as acquiring a string of mistresses and becoming an habitu\u00e9 of fashionable London salons. In his forties, however, Duleep began to fantasise about winning back his lost kingdom and became drawn into the Great Game being played out between the British Raj and Tsarist Russia on the North-West Frontier. Queen Victoria was sufficiently alarmed to write to him in 1886, complaining about 'extraordinary reports of your intending to transfer your allegiance to Russia! I cannot believe this of you who have always professed such loyalty and devotion towards me, who you know have always been your true friend and who I may say took a maternal interest in you from the time, when now 32 years ago, you came to England as a beautiful and charming Boy!' He sent an even more bizarre reply, admitting that he'd offered his services to Russia but begging 'to be permitted to subscribe myself your Majesty's most devoted humble servant'. Closely observed by British and Russian agents, Duleep made his way to Russia in 1887, announcing that, with Russian assistance, he would 'guarantee an easy conquest of India' and 'end the cruel yoke of British rule'. Though his plans caused some alarm in India, they were little more than fantasies. After less than a year, he left Russia for France and wrote to Queen Victoria, demanding the return of the Koh-i-Noor diamond which he intended to use to finance an Indian rebellion. In 1890, however, he was reduced to begging Queen Victoria's forgiveness, writing to her: 'I feel that in fighting against your country I have been fighting against God. I would return to England were I assured of your free pardon.' Campbell does not persuade me that Duleep played any significant part in the Great Game. He has, however, written a readable, entertaining and well-researched biography of a flamboyant but ultimately tragic figure caught between two cultures. For some members of Britain's Sikh community, Campbell's conclusions are bound to prove controversial. In July 1999, the Prince of Wales unveiled at Thetford an equestrian statue of Duleep, commissioned by the Maharajah Duleep Singh Centenary Trust. An inscription on the statue records: 'Even today, the Sikh nation aspires to regain its sovereignty', and says of Duleep: 'He died in Paris having re-embraced the Sikh faith while still engaged in a struggle to reclaim his throne.' Campbell shows, however, that in 1893 Duleep died a Christian. There was no Sikh cremation of his remains. Instead, his embalmed body was transported in a dark oak coffin across the Channel to a funeral in St Andrew's Church, Elveden, conducted by the rector. Among the wreaths was one from the Prince of Wales, inscribed 'For auld lang syne', and another from Balmoral marked simply 'From Queen Victoria'.",

This was not the usual ostentatious practice of princes; they had a real intellectual relationship. Voltaire wrote to the king with amazing frankness, addressing him as 'Votre Humanit\u00e9', seeing in him the Godless ruler the Enlightenment dreamt of. In the end, he overstepped the mark, by meddling in state affairs and asking Frederick to intercede when a disreputable old friend found himself in trouble. Frederick did not answer. </p> <p>Later, Voltaire engaged in a vitriolic, anonymous, but public exchange of pasquinades with the king on the subject of a tiff between scholars.

This is a strange thing to happen to a government so phrase-obsessed, so conscious of language and, at times, so eloquent. But it is so. They are just not connecting. The party mantras about 'social justice and economic efficiency' or 'the Third Way' are now so stale they fall unheard, dead space on the nation's ear.

Emptiness is the fashionable charge against New Labour - the 'emptiness' of New Labour ideology, the symbolic emptiness of the Dome and now a book by a professor of 'language in social life' (no less), who asks whether New Labour's new politics is all 'just rhetoric, just empty words'? </p> <p>No such accusation is politically neutral. William Hague smoothly contrasts his blunt speaking with Blair's alleged emptiness. Emptiness only means something if you are full of a rival idea. And it turns out that Fairclough, far from being a neutral academic, is a fervent left-wing critic of Blair and all his works, who finds world markets barbaric and casually dismisses what he has achieved at home. </p> <p>That said, everyone with an ear for language has a problem with New Labour rhetoric - its bloodlessness, its lack of resonance or history, its thinness are the despair of the party's friends and the secret weapon of its enemies. But almost everything this government says, except by accident or under stress, has been carefully thought through and tested on focus groups. </p> <p>Sometimes, the phrases are tried out and withdrawn - 'stakeholding society' and 'forces of conservatism' are examples. But once it has a form of words which 'works', such as social exclusion (which must always be 'tackled'), it tends to stick with monotonous insistence to them. These key phrases and verbal tricks are loaded with political meaning. This book acutely notes, for instance, how the main players in the global economy, the multinational corporations, hardly ever appear in Blair speeches directly; globalisation is presented as something that simply happens, in passive sentences - 'Capital is mobile, technology can migrate quickly'. This reinforces New Labour's belief that globalisation cannot be resisted and that governments should help us cope with it. </p> <p>Or, again, there is that 'not only, but also' formulation which clogs almost every 'big idea' speech or article from New Labour. Central to the party's case is that there used to be 'false choices' between competing goods which are now happily behind us. So we can have not only freedom, but also fairness; ambition and compassion; social justice and economic dynamism; European solidarity and US-style flexibility. </p> <p>Political words are meant to move us, literally, to take us towards one thing and away from something else. But this is the magic cake of the new politics, perpetually eaten and always still sitting there, mouthwateringly untouched. 'Not only but also' is a habit of thought, as much as a rhetoric, which in speech or interview invariably produces a sing-song, lullaby cadence - restful, not to say soporific. </p> <p>Exactly so, say New Labour's critics; this is empty reassurance, intended to lull the electorate into ovine acquies cence with unfettered markets. In the real world, politics is about choices, about competing groups. Some win, others lose. The possibility that Blair and the rest have a point, that zero-sum politics is the problem, is generally disregarded. But however bad the problems of world markets are, they can be answered by politics, and they have brought material wealth to tens of millions of people excluded before. Ask the Chinese whether they want to be kept out of the world market. List the countries that have kept their trade barriers up and done better as a result. </p> <p>I find it hard to understand how Labour's left-wing critics, ignoring the minimum wage, tax credits for low-income working families, constitutional reform and the rest, can agree with the party's right-wing critics - who opposed all these things - that it stands for 'nothing'. This is not the neo-liberal conservative clique that Fairclough and others think; it is far more interesting and radical than that. But its chosen self-description would put a room of ecstasy-stuffed ravers to sleep. </p> <p>Blair has been keener on talking about tough choices in the abstract, combating unspecific enemies, than describing the choices and enemies he is making. Who is powerful, for instance, and has also had a hard time from this government (pensions companies, oil companies, BT)? Why will it not say so? </p> <p>As to Blair himself, however, the charge of insincerity is meaningless. I don't believe that there is a gap between Blair the politician and some other, 'real' Blair, watching himself with sardonic amusement. Life isn't like that. He would be unable to function if he did not believe in his own integrity. He has strong values and would, I think, crack up if he felt he was acting a cynical role. </p> <p>Certainly, he has many tricks of speech and gesture, very well described by Fairclough; the disarming smile, the shrugging away of impossible questions, the broken syntax, the hesitations, the references to his family and to himself in a 'coo, who'd have thought it?' way. But 'disarming' is the point. These are for today's television age what the traditional rhetorical devices were for the age of the platform speaker. They are the tricks, or tics, of a whole generation who grew up with a cult of informality and spontaneity. They are part of our post-Sixties public culture, as semi-instinctive to all successful politicians as Commons in-jokes were to Benjamin Disraeli. </p> <p>So where has New Labour gone wrong? First, they have tried to extend their coalition too far, alienating both sides with that sing-song, 'not only, but also'. The Government has failed to be clear about its own core purpose. Societies collapse without assertive non-market values. And that means democratic pressures on business. To the extent that the lullaby hides this, it is false and confusing. More clarity about this - the point of politics - would be the single biggest improvement New Labour could make to its language. </p> <p>The second failure is that it has actually been too naive in its use of rhetoric. It has underestimated the media culture it lives in. Readers and viewers are bombarded by so many corporate messages and fragments of commercial propaganda that they - we - have become very good at filtering them out. We constantly move on to the next thing. The blip-blip-blip of party mantras, honed in Millbank, is an unheard drone. </p> <p>The terrifying thing for New Labour is not that clever people can decode its language, but that the louder it shouts, the less we all listen.

And the scene marks the rough birth of their sexual liaison. </p> <p>The structure of the book is accomplished and symmetrical, like a planned palace.

You might suppose that the flash-forwards would depress the plot, but, instead, they introduce an elegiac quality to present happiness, something that rings emotionally true. It is, after all, often possible to see the end of a love affair contained in its beginning. </p> <p>I like the novel's painterly seascapes where shingle looks like newsprint and jellyfish prevent bathing. Shreve can construct a metaphorical landscape effortlessly, too. Just after Olympia falls for the doctor and has been talking to his wife, she 'leans for a moment against the frame of the door and, as she does, she happens to see, through the screen of a window, a small seal beach itself upon a rock.' </p> <p>Fortune's Rocks, you know, will prove much more than a place name.</p>",

You might suppose that the flash-forwards would depress the plot, but, instead, they introduce an elegiac quality to present happiness, something that rings emotionally true. It is, after all, often possible to see the end of a love affair contained in its beginning. I like the novel's painterly seascapes where shingle looks like newsprint and jellyfish prevent bathing. Shreve can construct a metaphorical landscape effortlessly, too. Just after Olympia falls for the doctor and has been talking to his wife, she 'leans for a moment against the frame of the door and, as she does, she happens to see, through the screen of a window, a small seal beach itself upon a rock.' Fortune's Rocks, you know, will prove much more than a place name.",

They paused in the bombing at 3pm, shipped buses in, and allowed a white-flag convoy to leave - and then they bombed that as well, killing Taisa's family and many others.</p> <p>The Observer , in a joint investigation with Channel 4's Dispatches , went to Katyr Yurt and saw what was left: a landscape as if from the Somme, streets smashed to matchwood, trees shredded, blood-stained cellars, the survivors in a frenzy of fear. The village was littered with the remains of Russian 'vacuum' bombs - fuel-air explosives that can suck your lungs inside out, their use against civilians banned by the Geneva Convention.</p> <p>Local witnesses, astonished by the first visit by Western outsiders to their village, ringed west and east by special troops from the Russian secret police, the FSB, said they had counted 363 corpses piled two or three high in the street - 'so many you couldn't get a car past them' - before the Russians took many of the bodies away and dumped them in a mass grave.</p> <p>Taisa has a cruelly burnt face, both hands burnt and bandaged, a broken right leg swathed in plaster, a left knee pinioned by iron bolts and internal bruising, and yet she wanted to tell us what happened. Taisa's father, Mansour, 45, a builder; her mother, Hava, 45, a school teacher; her brothers, Magomed, 14; Ruslan, 12; her cousin, Hava, eight; and her sister, Madina, six, were squashed into the family's black Volga saloon. She explained how the convoy left Katyr Yurt for what they hoped was safety. 'There was a white flag on our car, flying from a wooden stick,' she said. 'Then two planes came and they hit us and my dad and mum were sitting in front of us and my brother and me were sitting in the back seat. Then we were blown up. I fell to the mud in the ground.'</p> <p>Taisa winced as her aunt, Tabarik Zaumajeva, swabbed the burnt skin around her eye. The aunt said: 'At night she is scared to close her eyes. She told me that she was afraid the whole picture would come back.'</p> <p>The worst is that Taisa's aunt cannot bring herself to tell the little girl she is the only survivor of the seven people in the family car: 'I don't know how to tell her. If we tell her now, she wouldn't be able to bear it. She's already afraid to close her eyes at night. Last night she woke 10 times and we can't calm her down.'</p> <p>Katyr Yurt, to the west of Grozny, was quiet, calm and untouched on the night of 3 February. But Grozny had fallen and Chechen fighters had fled Russian revenge. Some of them passed through Katyr Yurt. There is one story that two Russian soldiers were kidnapped or killed that night. On the morning of 4 February, all hell began.</p> <p>Putin - who is widely expected to become President when Russia votes this month - has consistently denied human rights abuses in Chechnya. Putin's denials have mollified Western leaders, and only last month Foreign Secretary Robin Cook met him in Moscow and went out of his way to praise the ex-KGB secret policeman who gave out hunting knives to his troops on New Year's Day. Cook said of Putin: 'I found his style refreshing and open, and his priorities for Russia are ones that we would share.'</p> <p>What follows is the evidence The Observer/Dispatches has obtained about what his forces did to the civilians of Katyr Yurt, evidence that might call into question the Foreign Secretary's endorsement of Putin's priorities 'that we would share'.</p> <p>Rumissa Medhidova is 27, but her face is so sick with grief and horror she looks 30 years older. She became a widow on 4 February. 'All the Russians left the village and at around 10am they started to bomb.They used everything. In the centre of the village, not one house is left standing.

      "bodyText": "Her face burnt almost beyond recognition, she lies prone on her hospital bed and tells in a child's whispers of the day her mother, father, her two brothers, her sister and her cousin - among 363 people from the same village - were wiped out. At eight years old, Taisa Abakarova is an eyewitness to the worst war crime in the savage campaign of Russia's acting President, Vladimir Putin, against the 'terrorist fighters' of Chechnya. The village of Katyr Yurt, 'safe' in the Russian-occupied zone, far from the war's front line, and jam-packed with refugees, was untouched on the morning of 4 February when Russian aircraft, helicopters, fuel-air bombs and Grad missiles pulverised the village. They paused in the bombing at 3pm, shipped buses in, and allowed a white-flag convoy to leave - and then they bombed that as well, killing Taisa's family and many others. The Observer , in a joint investigation with Channel 4's Dispatches , went to Katyr Yurt and saw what was left: a landscape as if from the Somme, streets smashed to matchwood, trees shredded, blood-stained cellars, the survivors in a frenzy of fear. The village was littered with the remains of Russian 'vacuum' bombs - fuel-air explosives that can suck your lungs inside out, their use against civilians banned by the Geneva Convention. Local witnesses, astonished by the first visit by Western outsiders to their village, ringed west and east by special troops from the Russian secret police, the FSB, said they had counted 363 corpses piled two or three high in the street - 'so many you couldn't get a car past them' - before the Russians took many of the bodies away and dumped them in a mass grave. Taisa has a cruelly burnt face, both hands burnt and bandaged, a broken right leg swathed in plaster, a left knee pinioned by iron bolts and internal bruising, and yet she wanted to tell us what happened. Taisa's father, Mansour, 45, a builder; her mother, Hava, 45, a school teacher; her brothers, Magomed, 14; Ruslan, 12; her cousin, Hava, eight; and her sister, Madina, six, were squashed into the family's black Volga saloon. She explained how the convoy left Katyr Yurt for what they hoped was safety. 'There was a white flag on our car, flying from a wooden stick,' she said. 'Then two planes came and they hit us and my dad and mum were sitting in front of us and my brother and me were sitting in the back seat. Then we were blown up. I fell to the mud in the ground.' Taisa winced as her aunt, Tabarik Zaumajeva, swabbed the burnt skin around her eye. The aunt said: 'At night she is scared to close her eyes. She told me that she was afraid the whole picture would come back.' The worst is that Taisa's aunt cannot bring herself to tell the little girl she is the only survivor of the seven people in the family car: 'I don't know how to tell her. If we tell her now, she wouldn't be able to bear it. She's already afraid to close her eyes at night. Last night she woke 10 times and we can't calm her down.' Katyr Yurt, to the west of Grozny, was quiet, calm and untouched on the night of 3 February. But Grozny had fallen and Chechen fighters had fled Russian revenge. Some of them passed through Katyr Yurt. There is one story that two Russian soldiers were kidnapped or killed that night. On the morning of 4 February, all hell began. Putin - who is widely expected to become President when Russia votes this month - has consistently denied human rights abuses in Chechnya. Putin's denials have mollified Western leaders, and only last month Foreign Secretary Robin Cook met him in Moscow and went out of his way to praise the ex-KGB secret policeman who gave out hunting knives to his troops on New Year's Day. Cook said of Putin: 'I found his style refreshing and open, and his priorities for Russia are ones that we would share.' What follows is the evidence The Observer/Dispatches has obtained about what his forces did to the civilians of Katyr Yurt, evidence that might call into question the Foreign Secretary's endorsement of Putin's priorities 'that we would share'. Rumissa Medhidova is 27, but her face is so sick with grief and horror she looks 30 years older. She became a widow on 4 February. 'All the Russians left the village and at around 10am they started to bomb.They used everything. In the centre of the village, not one house is left standing. In one family there were three children around their dead mother. They had been shot in the leg by Kalashnikovs. At half past four, they said: \"We will give you two hours\". They sent buses in with white flags.' People rushed around to find white sheets or anything at all white to mark their cars. There was even time for a joke: 'I saw a cow with white on its horns and people were laughing.' The convoy set off, each car showing a white flag, some cars showing two or three, packed with mainly women and children - the men held back, to make more room for children, said Rumissa. It headed west towards the town of Achoi Martan and safety. 'When we were on the open road, they fired ground-to-air rockets at us. It was a big rocket, not as big as a car. It was strange. It didn't explode once, it exploded several times. Every car had flags, how many cars I don't know. It was a mess, lots of them. They hit us without stopping.'

      "bodyText": "If Celtic are made over in the image of Kenny Dalglish, they will certainly not lack the one quality essential to challengers in pursuit of a championship. Limitless courage was the element that underpinned Dalglish's incomparable talent through almost 20 years as a player at the highest level and, as a manager for most of the subsequent 15, he has continued to demonstrate a stiff resistance to intimidation. Only three games into his tenure as temporary head coach in the aftermath of John Barnes's sacking, there has been sufficient evidence to conclude that Dalglish has already begun to suffuse his players with some of the imperishable desire and firmness of purpose that marked his own endeavours with Celtic and Liverpool. With Hibs to be faced at Easter Road this evening and the potentially decisive match against Rangers due at Celtic Park on Wednesday, Dalglish's charges will require all the commitment and application he has to spare if they are to sustain the resurgence that has brought victories over Dundee (twice) in the Premier League and Kilmarnock in the CIS Insurance League Cup semi-final. Through his two decades as a player, Dalglish was noted for his durability, his singular talent for avoiding injury, leading to a constant availability that made him the idol of managers such as Bob Paisley and Jock Stein. But there was much more to his reliability than an ability to swerve out of the path of lunging opponents with mischief on their minds. Dalglish sustained injury all right, but his fundamental bravery and his cussed refusal to succumb ensured that his absences were kept to a minimum. There was a time at Anfield when he played for a month with a stress fracture of his leg and finally had to be ordered by Paisley to take a break to allow the healing process to take its course.

      "body": "<p>Nothing became the County Championship so much as its passing. Last week, the venerable old tournament was killed off by the small print of a contract. </p> <p>Now promising young players will strive to be offered an ECB contract rather than grind their careers into the dust on the county circuit. Once they have signed on the dotted line they will be paid handsomely not to play county cricket. The Championship is on garden leave. The end will come soon. </p> <p>It is in many ways an act of euthanasia. The cricket counties have conceded to Duncan Fletcher the final say as to who plays in their Championship team on two conditions. One, they receive compensation. The counties will receive \u00a350,000 for each contracted player which is more than some of them take at the gate in an entire championship season. Two, the contracted players will be free to play in the NatWest and the Benson and Hedges. The priorities are clear. One-day cricket is more important than the Championship. </p> <p>There was more evidence of its demise at the announcement at Lords on Friday of Middlesex's new sponsorship deal with that 'venerable investment institution' The Equitable Life. Rather than talk about winning championships, Phil Edmonds, the Middlesex chairman, said he wanted the team to be 'a conveyor belt for people to join the England squad'. And looking at his assembled squad warned 'if you're not performing by 27 or 28 we'll be very ruthless with you'. The emphasis will be on youth and hurrying talented players quickly into the England set-up. </p> <p>Something Edmonds wishes had happened to his captain Mark Ramprakash. 'If this new system had pertained 10 years ago and Ramprakash been selected by an enlightened group_ then by the time he was 20 he would have been the fulcrum of the side and by now captain of England. He suffered because of the syndrome we had in this country that you have to prove yourself in county cricket.' </p> <p>No longer. Chris Schofield has only played 12 county matches - not sufficient to become disillusioned unless he has an exceptionally low boredom threshold. He owes his place in the elite squad to a very successful England A tour. </p> <p>It is be hoped that Schofield's inclusion will set a precedent. That the selectors will take more note of a young player per forming well against a variety of opponents on a variety of pitches than one who grinds out consecutive fifties at Leicester and Northampton. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Championship will meander along for a while. There will be moaning when Gough isn't allowed to play but Ramprakash is for, as far as it can be, vital Championship match. But no one will take any notice. The deed has been done. The County Championship, which is dependent on income generated from Test matches to survive, is now subservient to it. </p> <p>On Friday, it was difficult to leave Lords because all the security staff were posing for a photograph reminiscent of those pre-war sepia numbers hung next to the poster of Winston Churchill in olde worlde pubs.

      "bodyText": "Nothing became the County Championship so much as its passing. Last week, the venerable old tournament was killed off by the small print of a contract. Now promising young players will strive to be offered an ECB contract rather than grind their careers into the dust on the county circuit. Once they have signed on the dotted line they will be paid handsomely not to play county cricket. The Championship is on garden leave. The end will come soon. It is in many ways an act of euthanasia. The cricket counties have conceded to Duncan Fletcher the final say as to who plays in their Championship team on two conditions. One, they receive compensation. The counties will receive \u00a350,000 for each contracted player which is more than some of them take at the gate in an entire championship season. Two, the contracted players will be free to play in the NatWest and the Benson and Hedges. The priorities are clear. One-day cricket is more important than the Championship. There was more evidence of its demise at the announcement at Lords on Friday of Middlesex's new sponsorship deal with that 'venerable investment institution' The Equitable Life. Rather than talk about winning championships, Phil Edmonds, the Middlesex chairman, said he wanted the team to be 'a conveyor belt for people to join the England squad'. And looking at his assembled squad warned 'if you're not performing by 27 or 28 we'll be very ruthless with you'. The emphasis will be on youth and hurrying talented players quickly into the England set-up. Something Edmonds wishes had happened to his captain Mark Ramprakash. 'If this new system had pertained 10 years ago and Ramprakash been selected by an enlightened group_ then by the time he was 20 he would have been the fulcrum of the side and by now captain of England. He suffered because of the syndrome we had in this country that you have to prove yourself in county cricket.' No longer. Chris Schofield has only played 12 county matches - not sufficient to become disillusioned unless he has an exceptionally low boredom threshold. He owes his place in the elite squad to a very successful England A tour. It is be hoped that Schofield's inclusion will set a precedent. That the selectors will take more note of a young player per forming well against a variety of opponents on a variety of pitches than one who grinds out consecutive fifties at Leicester and Northampton. Meanwhile, the Championship will meander along for a while. There will be moaning when Gough isn't allowed to play but Ramprakash is for, as far as it can be, vital Championship match. But no one will take any notice. The deed has been done. The County Championship, which is dependent on income generated from Test matches to survive, is now subservient to it. On Friday, it was difficult to leave Lords because all the security staff were posing for a photograph reminiscent of those pre-war sepia numbers hung next to the poster of Winston Churchill in olde worlde pubs. It seemed appropriate.",

It was his goal which gave relegation-threatened Portsmouth a 1-0 win at Ipswich - the home team's first defeat in 19 matches. </p> <p>The 33-year-old Claridge struck midway through the first-half, hurling himself through a ruck of players to convert Sammy Igoe's cross. Portsmouth, with only two previous wins away from home this season, could and should have made it 2-0. Lee Bradbury fired over the bar from eight yards after being handed a clear opening by Thomas Thogersen. </p> <p>Manchester City did not have the best of afternoons either, at Crystal Palace. City, inspired by Mark Kennedy, had the fillip of scoring the first goal. But Palace deservedly levelled through Clinton Morrison, and City then relied heavily on some excellent saves by Nicky Weaver - notably from Simon Rodgers - to avoid going under. </p> <p>But there is no stopping Charlton, who recorded their eleventh win in succession, at Bolton. </p> <p>Both their goals came in the last 10 minutes. Martin Pringle got the first and a mistake by Bolton defender Mark Fish led to Andy Hunt getting another a minute later. </p> <p>It was Charlton's first win at Bolton since 1955, and it has taken them 10 points clear in the title race. </p> <p>Perhaps the best in dividual scoring performance in the First Division came from Huddersfield's Martin Smith. His two goals - both in the first half - gave Huddersfield a 2-0 win over Wolves. </p> <p>Two youngsters attracting attention are inevitably David Healy and Alex Notman, the 20-year-old Manchester United strikers who are experiencing their first taste of regular first-team football through loan spells at Port Vale and Sheffield United. </p> <p>That Vale were able to get Healy was something of a coup for their manager, Brian Horton. The day after the loan agreement was con cluded, Healy was unexpectedly given his Northern Ireland debut against Luxembourg, and scored two of their goals in a 3-1 win. Horton describes him as a 'natural goalscorer,' adding: 'His pace alone is always going to cause teams problems.' </p> <p>The one drawback, though, concerns the question of the service relegation-threatened Vale can give him. As Horton admits: 'He has probably had better players alongside him in Manchester United's reserve team than he has in our side.' </p> <p>Healey, who did well on his debut against Stockport, without scoring, certainly found chances difficult to come by at Fulham. The home side, despite having three of their four senior strikers unavailable, established a 2-0 half-time lead through Lee Clark and Andrew Melville, and Clark made it 3-0 after the interval. </p> <p>However, it was not all doom and gloom for Healy. He had produced Vale's best scoring effort in the first half, and confirmed himself as their most dangerous oplayer by getting his first goal for the club in the 74th minute. </p> <p>Will Notman be celebrating any goals today against Queen's Park Rangers? </p> <p>Notman, a Scotland Under-21 international now in his second month on loan at Sheffield United, has only scored once. </p> <p>But United's assistant-manager, Kevin Bramwell, says: 'It was always going to take him time to adjust to the Nationwide League, because the game here is more physical and quicker than he is used to. In the circumstances, he is doing reasonably well. The great thing about him is that in all his matches, he has made a lot of good runs off the ball and never let his head drop. For me that sort of attitude is bound to help him become a top player.' </p> <p>Bramwell bridles at the suggestion that players like Notman cannot find it easy to being with 'lesser' clubs. </p> <p>'I do not think that any reserve team player can look upon coming here as a backwards step,' he says. 'Manchester United's reserves play at Gigg Lane, so playing-wise being here represents the biggest stage he has been on. </p> <p>'We do not usually take lads as young as Alex for our first team. Playing in big matches at Bramall Lane can be quite intimidating for them.'</p>",

It was Charlton's first win at Bolton since 1955, and it has taken them 10 points clear in the title race. Perhaps the best in dividual scoring performance in the First Division came from Huddersfield's Martin Smith. His two goals - both in the first half - gave Huddersfield a 2-0 win over Wolves. Two youngsters attracting attention are inevitably David Healy and Alex Notman, the 20-year-old Manchester United strikers who are experiencing their first taste of regular first-team football through loan spells at Port Vale and Sheffield United. That Vale were able to get Healy was something of a coup for their manager, Brian Horton. The day after the loan agreement was con cluded, Healy was unexpectedly given his Northern Ireland debut against Luxembourg, and scored two of their goals in a 3-1 win. Horton describes him as a 'natural goalscorer,' adding: 'His pace alone is always going to cause teams problems.' The one drawback, though, concerns the question of the service relegation-threatened Vale can give him. As Horton admits: 'He has probably had better players alongside him in Manchester United's reserve team than he has in our side.' Healey, who did well on his debut against Stockport, without scoring, certainly found chances difficult to come by at Fulham. The home side, despite having three of their four senior strikers unavailable, established a 2-0 half-time lead through Lee Clark and Andrew Melville, and Clark made it 3-0 after the interval. However, it was not all doom and gloom for Healy. He had produced Vale's best scoring effort in the first half, and confirmed himself as their most dangerous oplayer by getting his first goal for the club in the 74th minute. Will Notman be celebrating any goals today against Queen's Park Rangers? Notman, a Scotland Under-21 international now in his second month on loan at Sheffield United, has only scored once. But United's assistant-manager, Kevin Bramwell, says: 'It was always going to take him time to adjust to the Nationwide League, because the game here is more physical and quicker than he is used to. In the circumstances, he is doing reasonably well. The great thing about him is that in all his matches, he has made a lot of good runs off the ball and never let his head drop. For me that sort of attitude is bound to help him become a top player.' Bramwell bridles at the suggestion that players like Notman cannot find it easy to being with 'lesser' clubs. 'I do not think that any reserve team player can look upon coming here as a backwards step,' he says. 'Manchester United's reserves play at Gigg Lane, so playing-wise being here represents the biggest stage he has been on. 'We do not usually take lads as young as Alex for our first team. Playing in big matches at Bramall Lane can be quite intimidating for them.'",

Stilian has now apologised. 'I absolutely do not think Scottish women are ugly,' he told the Record , posing alongside three attractive female journalists. 'There are in fact some very beautiful ladies in this country.' The Record , however, remain unconvinced that Scottish women will forgive him.

While Carbone himself has adjusted to life in England since his move from Inter to Sheffield Wednesday four years ago, he has become increasingly concerned about his wife's plight. 'I have a big problem with my family,' he tells next month's Match of the Day magazine. 'My wife hasn't spoken to anyone for three years. She doesn't know anybody.

As for the match itself, I have mixed feelings about the view that Arsenal's performance was one of the best by any British team in Europe for years. To an extent, the scoreline flattered them - there was precious little to choose between the teams until Deportivo had a player sent off, with the Gunners leading 2-1. It was at that point that the visitors disintegrated. </p> <p>However, some of those Arsenal goals were stunning, and none more so than that effort from Kanu, when he beat two defenders and then, without touching the ball, forced the keeper to dive the wrong way. It was the sort of goal that all attacking players dream of scoring, but would probably be beyond any British player. As I have said before, this man not only comes from a different country, in the football sense he also comes from a different planet. </p> <p>But it will come as no surprise to me if even Kanu fails to find the net today. Villa have conceded only seven league goals at home, the best record in the Premiership. Moreover, this is a totally different Villa team from the one who appeared to be haunted by relegation worries earlier this season. </p> <p>In view of their recent League and cup success, it does seem difficult to believe that a short while ago their manager, John Gregory, was reportedly on the verge of being sacked. However, if there is one thing I have learnt as a manager, it concerns the extent to which seemingly small things can transform one's fortunes. </p> <p>The most vivid ray of hope for any manager in trouble has to be the memory of that misplaced Oxford back-pass in the 1984 Milk Cup tie against Everton - a mistake that led to Everton getting a 1-1 draw and proved to be the launching pad from which their then-beleaguered manager, Howard Kendall, steered the club to the most successful spell in their history. </p> <p>There are countless other examples of seemingly remarkable turning points. I know it's a truism, but in most cases the key word in explaining the difference between teams at the top and bottom is confidence. It is amazing how easily it can be lost - and regained. </p> <p>In Villa's case, one thing I have noticed about them is the results when Ehiogu has not been playing. Of the eight first-team games he has missed this season, they have lost five and won only one. He is quick and brave. He is strong in the tackle and in the air.

At least Joe Cole will not be relegated from the entire Premier League come the end of the season, as Watford undoubtedly now will be, and it just might be that the youngster learnt more from watching than playing in this uninspiring game. West Ham had the base for an easy win when they led through first-half goals from Steve Lomas and Paulo Wanchope. But the visitors seemed to lose motivation after the break and Watford finished the stronger side after Heidar Helguson scored, and they probably deserved a draw for their effort. The East End's finest looked a touch cream crackered coming into this match as the demands of a season which started last July, with the InterToto Cup, seemed to have taken its toll. After a 4-0 drubbing from Everton last weekend it was no wonder then that Redknapp made four changes to his side, in an attempt, no doubt, to breathe some life into a weary run of two wins in their last 10 games before this one. Watford, however, dream of such form as they rapidly get cast further adrift at the bottom of the Premiership table and are without a win this year. So, it came as little surprise that West Ham started the better side and Lomas gave them the lead in their first attack after just three minutes. Wanchope made it possible when he beat a Nigel Gibbs challenge on the halfway line and ended a forceful run when he found Frank Lampard to his right. The young England midfielder played the ball swiftly into the path of Lomas, who swept a first-time shot into the net from 12 yards out. Watford almost equalised three minutes later when Peter Kennedy met a Nordin Wooter cross at the far post but he could do nothing more as he stood and watched his powerful header squeezed on to the crossbar and over by the visiting goalkeeper Craig Forrest. But there was little to commend from either side until the Costa Rican Wanchope -still the subject of much transfer speculation this week - produced one of his truly magical moments, as only he can, to score West Ham's second goal in the 35th minute. He juggled a Trevor Sinclair pass from his shoulder to his head to beat the defender Robert Page, and then let the ball bounce before swinging a powerful right-foot volley to send the ball booming into the top of the net. Graham Taylor fears he is in a minority of one in his belief that his team can avoid relegation. Indeed, before kick-off today he said as much although he was quick to justify it by adding that a football miracle was also needed. And so it was that the Watford manager vainly attempted to save this game by making a triple substitution at half time. It worked, for a time at least, in that Watford dominated for a spell after the re-start, first going close with a sweetly struck Allan Smart volley. They finally broke through in the 62nd minute through Helguson in the 62nd minute. The Icelandic international benefited when Wooter's run at the West Ham defence was blocked, and the ball broke kindly for Helguson to volley in his third goal in six Watford appearances. It was a start, yes, but surely not enough in the time remaining to turn Taylor's dream of a footballing miracle into reality.",

United had not succeeded in making any impression on Liverpool's defence throughout the first half, but when a studs-up challenge by Solskjaer saw the excellent Sami Hyypia depart on a stretcher five minutes before the interval, G\u00e9rard Houllier delayed making a substitution and saw his gamble doubly backfire. First Solskjaer had the cheek to take advantage during the period Liverpool were down to 10 men, and then when Hyypia hobbled out for the start of the second half he quickly realised he could not carry on and had to be substituted after all. </p> <p>'Solskjaer is not a nasty player and he apologised at half-time, but I was very unhappy about the challenge,' said Houllier, who made his feelings known to the United striker at the time of the incident. The Liverpool manager took responsibility for waiting while Hyypia had stitches inserted into an ankle wound, claiming the tall Finn was so important to the defence it was worth giving him every chance. As Solskjaer was able to prove. 'They are so clinical, they are better than us in front of the box,' Houllier said. 'They only had one chance in the first half and scored - we came off at half-time with the feeling we had been really unfairly treated.' </p> <p>As Liverpool, by Houllier's own admission, created and squandered at least four clear additional goal chances, perhaps they ought to be satisfied with a point and the knowledge that they had the champions worried. Still lacking Jamie Redknapp and Robbie Fowler, with Steven Gerrard suspended and Vegard Heggem lasting only half as long as Hyypia before sustaining a hamstring injury, they certainly gave United a game, even if Houllier's argument for a moral victory was undermined by Jamie Carragher having to clear off his line three times. </p> <p>A draw was fair, both managers agreed, but whereas Sir Alex Ferguson said he was pleased by his teams effort and intensity, Houllier will reflect on what might have been had he handled his three substitutions differently. He had little choice over Heggem after 16 minutes, but Rigobert Song at right back was given a roasting by the in-form Ryan Giggs, giving United an attacking lifeline which ultimately led to their equaliser. </p> <p>Song was not in position when Giggs got through on the left and though Carragher partially blocked the cross, the ball sat up for Solskjaer to score with a deflection off Dominic Matteo. </p> <p>Carragher was switched to centre-back for the second half, with Danny Murphy replacing Hyypia, but was unable to perform with his earlier authority. United were able to get into the Liverpool box with comparative ease in the second half and Liverpool had cause to thank Carragher. A superb pass from Giggs took out Song and Stephane Henchoz and allowed Solskjaer to beat Sander Westerveld, but the goalkeeper slowed the shot allowing Carragher to tidy up. </p> <p>By the time the same defender had also denied Giggs and then Teddy Sheringham in the final minute, he could be said to have atoned for the two own-goals he contributed to United's 3-2 victory at Anfield in September. </p> <p>Liverpool's third substitution was to introduce Michael Owen for the last 15 minutes.

Liverpool had to be content with Berger's opening goal, a piledriving free-kick which fairly whistled past Van der Gouw after Stam had clumsily brought down fellow Dutchman Erik Meijer at what he probably thought was a safe distance 30 yards out. </p> <p>It is doubtful Mark Bosnich would have stopped the shot either, even if he had been playing.

      "body": "<p>'Wrighty, Wrighty, what's the score?' mocked the 4,000 followers of Preston as this clinical destruction was completed. The message wasn't so much meant as an insult to the biggest icon on the field as an indication of priorities for these famous old clubs: Burnley could keep their showbiz attraction, North End would sooner focus on promotion. </p> <p>There was something surreal about Ian Wright's infiltration of this age-old local affair. An awe inspiring, almost alien presence, oozing London cool and television host twinkle, gatecrashing the earthy hostility of a history-stoked Lancashire derby. It was like a character from EastEnders breezing into an intimate gathering at the Rovers Return. </p> <p>Getting his name into a fanzine named Bob Lord's Sausage (in honour of the club's former chairman) is surely a new experience for the striker who has packed everything from non-league dreams through FA bans to Premiership medals into his treasure chest of football memories. </p> <p>Anyone who thought a step down the divisions would make for gentler afternoons was much mistaken. This was physical, frenetic and bruising, marked by late tackles and reckless arms. A violent, two-footed assault by Lenny Johnrose on Sean Gregan ended the Preston captain's involvement after eight minutes. Feelings were running high. Before half-time the Clarets were reduced to 10 men when Dean West was punished for the second of two clumsy hacks. </p> <p>Evidence of the fever ignited by the effervescent striker - Ian Wright Wright Wright scarves were doing a fine trade outside the ground before kick off - had melted into far hotter emotions. </p> <p>Preston's determined start paved the way for an early goal, Michael Jackson's powerful header arcing into the top corner inside 90 seconds. </p> <p>North End looked the better side in the opening period and were unlucky not to increase their lead. Burnley needed a surge of inspiration to peg their neighbours back, and it almost arrived courtesy of Wright. Twice around the half hour mark he steered headers agonisingly close to Tepi Moilanen's goal. </p> <p>There is no doubting the effect Wright has had since his arrival. The corresponding fixture a year ago attracted half this attendance. A new season ticket deal for the remaining home games has been unveiled to deal with fresh demand. </p> <p>Quite what Preston president Tom Finney made of Burnley's veteran signing is anybody's guess.

      "bodyText": "'Wrighty, Wrighty, what's the score?' mocked the 4,000 followers of Preston as this clinical destruction was completed. The message wasn't so much meant as an insult to the biggest icon on the field as an indication of priorities for these famous old clubs: Burnley could keep their showbiz attraction, North End would sooner focus on promotion. There was something surreal about Ian Wright's infiltration of this age-old local affair. An awe inspiring, almost alien presence, oozing London cool and television host twinkle, gatecrashing the earthy hostility of a history-stoked Lancashire derby. It was like a character from EastEnders breezing into an intimate gathering at the Rovers Return. Getting his name into a fanzine named Bob Lord's Sausage (in honour of the club's former chairman) is surely a new experience for the striker who has packed everything from non-league dreams through FA bans to Premiership medals into his treasure chest of football memories. Anyone who thought a step down the divisions would make for gentler afternoons was much mistaken. This was physical, frenetic and bruising, marked by late tackles and reckless arms. A violent, two-footed assault by Lenny Johnrose on Sean Gregan ended the Preston captain's involvement after eight minutes. Feelings were running high. Before half-time the Clarets were reduced to 10 men when Dean West was punished for the second of two clumsy hacks. Evidence of the fever ignited by the effervescent striker - Ian Wright Wright Wright scarves were doing a fine trade outside the ground before kick off - had melted into far hotter emotions. Preston's determined start paved the way for an early goal, Michael Jackson's powerful header arcing into the top corner inside 90 seconds. North End looked the better side in the opening period and were unlucky not to increase their lead. Burnley needed a surge of inspiration to peg their neighbours back, and it almost arrived courtesy of Wright. Twice around the half hour mark he steered headers agonisingly close to Tepi Moilanen's goal. There is no doubting the effect Wright has had since his arrival. The corresponding fixture a year ago attracted half this attendance. A new season ticket deal for the remaining home games has been unveiled to deal with fresh demand. Quite what Preston president Tom Finney made of Burnley's veteran signing is anybody's guess. The 77-year- old one time England ally of Sir Stanley Matthews can reflect, like Wright, on the cherished experience of scoring for his country and setting goal records for the club closest to his heart. Then again there are notable differences. Gentleman Tom, a one-club man, was never booked and always renowned for his sportsmanship. Having promised he would see out his career at Highbury, Wright has worn the colours of four clubs this season: from the claret and blue of West Ham to Burnley, via the red of Nottingham Forest and the green and white of Celtic. And so to Lancashire, a county that is reviving itself as a powerhouse in the game. With Bolton in the FA Cup semi-finals and Blackburn only recently exiled from the Premiership, the fact that Burnley and Preston can attract a sell-out gate of 22,000 for a Second Division game makes the footballing heart beat faster for these high flying clubs. An ambitiously refurbished Turf Moor would not look out of place in the Premiership. But it looks like Preston are closer to that pipe dream. This result has certainly given their promotion push a much needed fillip after a Deepdale blip that saw them drop five points from a possible six. In fact they have accrued more on their travels than at home this season. Burnley, though, deserved credit for a brief rally in the second half in spite of their depleted numbers. Stan Ter nant's men regained their composure and they applied pressure with a series of corners. The more they pushed, though, the more they were vulnerable to the counter attack. And how brutally they were punished. During one four white shirts bore down on two clarets, but Paul Crichton stood his ground to beat away brilliantly from Iain Anderson. Respite was brief.

      "body": "<p>A crocodile of tracksuited German footballers mooches into the conference room for a team talk. At the back is a little middle-aged man with a large head, waving and pulling faces at bystanders to show how boring the talk will be. At 38, Lothar Matth\u00e4us is recognisably a child. </p> <p>On Tuesday, in the Champions League against Real Madrid, he plays his last game for Bayern Munich. Two days later he flies to New York, to take up residence just off Central Park and play for the local MetroStars, an outfit described a while ago as 'the worst team in soccer'. Even though he will return to play for Germany in Euro 2000, an era ends this week. </p> <p>After the team talk the players mooch out of the conference room, all but Erich Ribbeck, the German coach, and his two senior players, Matth\u00e4us and Oliver Bierhoff. When Bierhoff leaves, he smiles at the waiting journalists. 'You have an interview with Matth\u00e4us? Always interesting!' </p> <p>Matth\u00e4us can no longer find anyone to call on his mobile phone, so the half-dozen journalists from around Europe are invited into the room vacated by his team-mates. The notepads on their desks are covered with talentless doodles. </p> <p>We sit down and Matth\u00e4us sends us to the drinks cabinet to stock up, checks that everyone's tape recorder works. Then, for almost two hours, he talks. At one point he says, 'I'm saying everything tonight, talking from the sewing box' - a German phrase for giving away private details. </p> <p>Matth\u00e4us always talks from the sewing box. It explains why there isn't a statue of him in every German town. For most of his extraordinary career he was admired but disliked. </p> <p>Born in 1961 in a small town in northern Bavaria, Matth\u00e4us grew up in a Germany that barely exists any more: a poor country, where the economic miracle was still unfolding and had yet to reach his family. His father worked in the local Puma factory. There was drink around the house. After school Matth\u00e4us qualified as an interior decorator, expecting a life of laying carpets. </p> <p>But in 1979 he turned pro at Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, and in the European Championship of 1980, made his debut for Germany against Holland. He gave away a penalty, though he still claims the foul was outside the area. Soon after, on a German winter tour of South America, he marked Diego Maradona and Zico out of matches. </p> <p>'I think my breakthrough was at the World Cup 1986,' he told us. Germany reached the final against Argentina, where the coach, Franz Beckenbauer, put him on Maradona again. </p> <p>'That was a mistake of Franz Beckenbauer's, I think. I concentrated on Maradona, but we neglected our own game. When they went 2-0 up we changed it around, Karl-Heinz F\u00f6rster was put on Maradona, I went forward more and we got back to 2-2. Then we made a dumb mistake and lost.' </p> <p>Even so, from then on Matth\u00e4us was now Germany's main man, the 'Chef' as the Germans say. The problem was that he got up everybody's nose. Opponents considered him the ultimate gamesman: no referee could spot his fouls, but typically, it was a Matth\u00e4us dive in 1986 that led to a red card for the Dane Frank Arnesen, whose World Cup ended there. </p> <p>His team-mates objected to Matth\u00e4us' chatter. Saying horrible things about colleagues and leaking to newspapers are traditions of German football, but Matth\u00e4us took them a bit far. He could not seem to cope for a second without attention. Also, irritatingly, he talked about himself in the third person. </p> <p>Ribbeck, German assistant manager in the early 1980s, commented, 'Even when we're discussing the meal plan, he quacks something in between.' Rudi V\u00f6ller, a team-mate, once advised him to direct his views at the toilet seat. Yet as a player Matth\u00e4us was only getting better. In Germany's first match of the 1990 World Cup against Yugoslavia, he scored twice and led his team to a 4-1 victory from which they never looked back. 'It was the best game of my international career. Important in a big tournament is how you start. With a great match at the start you can distance yourself from the unrest from outside. And it increases the respect among opponents.' </p> <p>A few weeks later, after another final against Maradona, he was standing in a Roman stadium wearing a captain's armband and holding aloft the World Cup. He was 29 and at his peak. In 1990 he was voted World Sportsman, World Footballer, European Sportsman, European Footballer and German Footballer of the Year. </p> <p>What kind of a player was he then? </p> <p>'I was certainly no Maradona,' he says. 'I was a very fast player. When I saw a space, I used it. When I went past somebody, he didn't catch up with me again. I was a player who came with a run-up. What Maradona could see in a small space, I saw over long distances.' </p> <p>Was he complete? </p> <p>'I'm small, but for instance I'm good at heading. Yes, the thing that made me strong was that I had something of everything. I always had a weak left foot, and Trapattoni taught me to use my left. I was 28 then.' </p> <p>And, we say, there is his will to win. Whereas for some players everything is fine again half an hour after a defeat, for you... </p> <p>Matth\u00e4us interrupts. 'Five minutes after the game everything is fine again! After the Champions League final against Manchester, I had to comfort my girlfriend, not she me. She was more upset than I was.' </p> <p>The complete footballer , yet he always lacked something. Towering over the German game is the figure of Franz Beckenbauer. 'Der Kaiser' was imperious: elegant, calm, cool. Matth\u00e4us was desperate for attention, ostentatiously trying. When the legendary photographer Annie Leibowitz shot him for a credit card advertisement, it was as an exhausted labourer covered in sweat. </p> <p>Beckenbauer was above the fray; Matth\u00e4us was in the middle of the fray. </p> <p>Even on the pitch he was human. With five minutes to go in that World Cup final of 1990, and the score 0-0, Germany won a penalty. Matth\u00e4us was the penalty taker, but it was Andy Brehme who stepped up to put the ball into the bottom corner. Later it emerged that the boots in which Matth\u00e4us had played for four years had given out during the marathon semi-final against England in Turin. He lacked sufficient faith in the new ones to place a penalty-kick. Even so, it would never have happened to Beckenbauer. </p> <p>In April 1992, playing for Inter Milan, Matth\u00e4us tore a knee ligament. For a 32-year-old footballer, this looked like the beginning of the end. </p> <p>One day he got a phone call from Beckenbauer, who had become Bayern president. </p> <p>Matth\u00e4us said: 'Look, Franz, I don't feel right here.' </p> <p>'So come back to Bayern,' said Beckenbauer. </p> <p>'But Franz, I have a ligament injury.' </p> <p>'I know you have a ligament injury. Come back to Bayern.' </p> <p>Inter, thinking he was a long way from fitness, sold him for about \u00a31.4 million. Twenty-five days later he was playing in the Bundesliga again. </p> <p>Then, at the Munich beer festival, he allegedly told a Dutch tourist who was irritating him: 'They forgot you in Adolf's time.' The story broke. </p> <p>Alleged racist and sexist comments have been a feature of Matth\u00e4us's career. He is no fascist, just a bad boy saying naughty things. The one member of the German side who upbraided him for them was J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, who was growing into the team's new 'Chef'. </p> <p>Klinsmann is Matth\u00e4us's opposite: a man at ease with himself, diplomatic and, by footballers' standards, intellectual. 'He thinks too much,' says Matth\u00e4us. </p> <p>Both men played at the 1994 World Cup where Germany were knocked out in the quarter-finals, after every conversation in the team camp had made the papers. Matth\u00e4us and Klinsmann came to hate one another. Berti Vogts, the manager, sided with Klinsmann. Matth\u00e4us says he now regards the public row with Vogts and Klinsmann as the biggest mistake of his career. </p> <p>From 1994 to 1998 he did not play for Germany. It was said the players had decided to do without him. Much of the time he was injured anyway, again apparently nearing retirement. Vogts said he caused unrest. Beckenbauer said of him, 'If you talk a lot, you talk a lot of nonsense.' </p> <p>How upset Matth\u00e4us was became clear when he published My Diary in 1997. The book is distinguished chiefly by the banality of the entries, which are reminiscent of Adrian Mole. There is also the bitterness familiar from politicians' diaries. On Sunday 21 July 1996 Matth\u00e4us writes from the Bayern training camp: 'Today the European champions have returned: Helmer, Ziege, Babbel, Kahn, Strunz and Scholl. There was a big hallo. And from me, sincerely felt congratulations. European champions - for all of them, it's the peak of their careers.'</p> <p>Or, decoded: 'None of them won the World Cup.' </p> <p>Gradually everything came right for him. His injuries cleared, while those of the much younger Sammer did not. The German side got worse. When Vogts recalled him for the 1998 World Cup, he gladly came back. As he once said, 'If I couldn't speak to or work with all the people with whom I've had problems, I'd often be alone on the pitch.' </p> <p>This return was a mixed success: Germany went out in the quarter-finals again, but Matth\u00e4us played quite well. Still, he seemed to be joking when he said after the competition, 'Quit? Why would I want to do a thing like that?' </p> <p>And, yet, there he still is. He says, 'I like football. It's fun winning the ball from someone, it's fun shooting at goal, it's fun hitting a ball over 60 metres that arrives. It's like in golf: if you hit a ball and it flies and flies and flies, you enjoy it.' And if you don't play, you don't get attention. </p> <p>As the German team declined he became more important. After they lost 3-0 to the United States a year ago, Matth\u00e4us was called to Ribbeck's hotel room, where he explained that Germany had to play with two wingers. It came to pass. </p> <p>With Matth\u00e4us as libero, Germany qualified for Euro 2000. But as Beckenbauer said, even if they were dragged out of their beds in the middle of the night to play barefoot, the World Cup winners of 1990 would beat this team. </p> <p>Matth\u00e4us himself is not the player he was. Yet he has become more popular. 'In the last two or three years I haven't noticed the same whistles, the same songs against me. I think that for many people, even in other professions, I have become a sort of example.' He claims that a man in his fifties had written to him saying that he had successfully cited Matth\u00e4us in a job interview, as proof that performance matters and not age. </p> <p>His team-mates, too, have learned not to take him seriously. When there is a story in Bild , or Kicker , they grin and say, 'Oh, Lothar.' And most of the time he is kind. To younger players, he can be something of an uncle. </p> <p>He becomes enthused when he talks about New York. In previous months he had worried the Americans with comments such as, 'They can't drag me to New York in handcuffs. I've been misled and deceived. That can be done with others, but not with me.' </p> <p>This time he reveals: 'I said to myself, \"Man, New York, it's a big city, an interesting city, and you can learn something now there, namely English\".' </p> <p>But if he wanted a big, interesting city in which he could learn English, why not London? </p> <p>'Even if you don't believe me, three months ago I had two offers from London. No, it had to be New York.' </p> <p>How does he view the England team, Germany's opponents in Euro 2000? </p> <p>'I know the Englishman has a lot of respect for the German. The many negative results of England against Germany, they're hard to put out of your head.' </p> <p>What advice does he have for David Beckham? </p> <p>'I would advise him to keep his private life out of the media, even if that is very difficult. Something will always get in the papers, but he shouldn't open the curtains. I made that same mistake.' </p> <p>By the way, Lothar, which London clubs wanted you? </p> <p>'Which club is bottom of the Premier League? Bradford? No, Watford. Watford and Fulham.' </p> <p>He is keen to answer more questions. We have none left. He clasps all our shoulders, clearly sad to see us go. They say you should never meet your heroes, but it's also dangerous to meet your villains: I now think Lothar Matth\u00e4us is a nice guy. </p> <p>We stagger out and he lights on a fan in the bar who wants an autograph. </p> <p>In appalling English, Matth\u00e4us asks him: 'How you write name?' Determined to get it right, he makes the fan write his name on a magazine before he signs. </p> <p>Then, at nearly midnight, when all his team-mates are long tucked up in bed, he takes a stool at the bar with two Kicker journalists and starts to gossip.</p>",

      "body": "<p>So farewell then Alan Shearer. A nation mourns. 'At the end of the day.' That was your catchphrase. And now it is. </p> <p>Or nearly is, or actually should be. Leaving aside the argument that it might be best if Shearer went now rather than be allowed to dictate his retirement from international football after Euro 2000, his announcement that he wants to concentrate on club football and his family has sent out a maelstrom of messages for the game at home and abroad, all of them alarming. </p> <p>The first is in physical toll.

Leaving aside the argument that it might be best if Shearer went now rather than be allowed to dictate his retirement from international football after Euro 2000, his announcement that he wants to concentrate on club football and his family has sent out a maelstrom of messages for the game at home and abroad, all of them alarming. The first is in physical toll. Injuries have clearly sapped Shearer, to the point where he cannot see his now 29-year-old frame making it to the World Cup in 2002.

      "body": "<p>When Lord Taylor condemned the state of English football stadiums a decade ago, with its cattle fences, Victorian sanitation and stench of stewing onions, attendances in the top division had slumped to their lowest level since the Second World War. During the 1988-89 season, each game, on average, filled the stadium to 55 per cent of capacity. Since the inception of the Premiership, that figure has risen steadily and, although most stadiums are smaller, currently stands at a staggering 94 per cent. </p> <p>Because of the game's soaring popularity, the requirements of the Taylor report haven't simply been met, they have been massively exceeded. As a result, next season should see turnstiles click more busily than for over 20 years. </p> <p>By the time the 2000-01 season kicks off, completed developments at Old Trafford, St James's Park and the Stadium of Light will account for another 32,000 bums on Premiership seats at every home game. And that's not all: consider the swap factor. Should, say, Manchester City and Birmingham City win promotion at the expense of Bradford and Watford, that would be another 22,000. A few years down the line, when extensions at West Ham, Aston Villa and Leeds have been built and Arsenal, Coventry, Leicester and Southampton have settled into roomy new homes, the Premiership will possess the potential to hit an average gate of 40,000, the biggest since the masses flocked to see Stanley Matthews and the rest in the Fifties. </p> <p>'If clubs are going to develop their fan base they have to create a situation where new fans are not excluded by sell-outs and season ticket policies. The only way is to increase capacities and clubs are responding,' says Premier League spokesman Mike Lee. </p> <p>At first, it seemed the Taylor report recommendation to do away with our beloved if bedraggled terraces would drastically reduce capacities. The most practical way for clubs to cope with the demands of all-seater grounds was to drill rows of seats on to existing concrete banks. Little did they imagine the need for a second phase of expansion. 'Nobody in 1990 could have predicted the runaway success of the Premier League,' notes Simon Inglis, author of the Football Grounds of Great Britain . 'Look at the strategy of a club like Newcastle, who, when they redeveloped to a figure of 36,000, it seemed a perfectly sensible way forward. After all, they were only getting 18,000 not long before. Now they are looking at 51,000. Similarly Chelsea. That's the unpredictable nature of football.' </p> <p>But before the cement mixers move in, clubs would do well to note events at Aston Villa this season. Dismal results equalled dwindling crowds. The missing claret-and-blue legions indicate a new tendency for disaffected supporters to be selective. While value for money barely came into the equation when you turned up on the spur of the moment and dug around for a few coins in exchange for your slab of terrace and a guaranteed singsong, it's another matter when \u00a330 buys a torpid atmosphere and a terrible game. There is a question mark when fans don't feel part of the spectacle. There is doubt when that crucial sense of identifying with the players entrusted to represent the shirt is dimmed by short contracts and swift movement in this post-Bosman age. There is concern pay-per-view will be another punch on the nose to supporters trying to defend the traditional values of the people's game. </p> <p>Sceptics fear pretty much every expanding club, except Manchester United, are wading in precariously deep waters and may end up with half empty stadiums. Inglis argues that won't happen, instead envisaging benefits for the old school faithful: 'I think the boom is going to end, but that doesn't necessarily mean the market will go. Take Newcastle, for example. If they can't fill their stadium they will have to go back to the fans with cheap deals. Therefore we will return to the pre-Taylor scenario where fans can arrive on the day and buy tickets at a much healthier price. Now is the perfect time to build while clubs can afford to develop using television money and the boom, and eventually those extra seats can be sold cheaply.' </p> <p>Interestingly, Tottenham have announced a freeze on ticket prices for next season. This is the first sign of a club recognising that football in the twenty-first century has its price - and it is a price with limits. Either that or the penny has finally dropped that a team without a striker will eventually stretch unconditional loyalty to breaking point.</p>",

The Norwegian, having missed earlier, needs no second invitation and his equaliser simply compounded the injustice. </p> <p>By then, United could have been two down, with Berger and Titi Camara missing good chances.

Liverpool were grateful that Carragher thrice cleared from the line to make amends for two own goals in the previous meeting between the two teams at Anfield. </p> <p>For all that, it would have been no surprise had Owen pinched all three points. It was agonising for the Liverpool bench to watch. 'The ball spun out at the last moment. From where we were, it was going in for a long time,' said Houllier.

      "body": "<p>On her first day in office Kate Hoey criticised Manchester United's 'shabby' decision to forsake this season's FA Cup, prompting Martin Edwards to label her 'ignorant and disgraceful'. More headlines followed when she urged Sir Norman Foster to keep Wembley's twin towers, said she'd like to scrap the whole \u00a3475 million new national stadium and questioned the wisdom of awarding Ian Wright an MBE when he has such a dodgy disciplinary record. Not bad going for someone who, seven months after succeeding Tony Banks as Minister for Sport, says: 'I'm quite pleased that I have kept out of the news.' </p> <p>Hoey has recently been busy keeping out of the news again by suggesting that police officers might prosecute players who whack opponents or intimidate referees during games. Typically candid, she rejected Alex Ferguson's claim that recent misbehaviour was just 'media hype', castigated the 'appalling behaviour' of six named Premiership clubs and asked football to rediscover 'the moral dimension'. By regularly referring to 'ethics, morality and decency', she sometimes sounds more like a religious leader than her real job which, as one child put it when Hoey recently opened a new sports centre near Rotherham, is to be 'the Prime Minister of Sport'. </p> <p>Compared to her predecessor's jokey, laddish, easy-copy style, Hoey is downbeat and earnest. Banks was effectively the Minister for Football (especially welcome at Stamford Bridge); she intends to be the minister for all of sport. He loved photo opportunities; her preoccupation is 'helping the grassroots'. But with much of sport in disarray, it's time to get serious. </p> <p>Hoey admits to worrying that football's soul is being stained by the influence of money, the pricing-out of less affluent fans and, especially, player misbehaviour. 'Children mimic all these things - spitting, chasing after referees, intimidating people - because they think they're not being a proper footballer unless they do it. That's a terrible, terrible example to youngsters.' When she bemoaned spitting by footballers, 'I got at least 100 letters from people saying \"you're absolutely right\". Schoolteachers wrote saying children in their playgrounds were mimicking what they'd seen on television. Some older people wrote saying \"this didn't happen when I was playing sport\". People in other, sports such as hockey and women's football, said \"this doesn't happen in our sports\". And I don't see cricketers doing it and I don't remember seeing Stanley Matthews spitting.' </p> <p>So how do we stop it? She has suggested heavier fines than the current two-week maximum. Now she goes further: clubs should voluntarily drop stars who step out of line. 'The clubs have to put penalties on them; they have to be chosen not to play, ultimately. Everybody within football has to do their bit to sort the game out, including the FA, club management, PFA and players themselves. Managers shouldn't be doing anything other than taking the blame and saying \"we're sorry\" and make the players take responsibility. It's always somebody else who's responsible for what happens on the field and that blame culture in football has got to stop.' </p> <p>The Minister is genuinely puzzled why the national game has become so indisciplined. She ponders aloud over money, society and footballers' backgrounds as possible explanations, then discounts each one. 'I was at the Imperial War Museum the other night where Sir Stirling Moss, Sir Roger Bannister, Sir Henry Cooper, Fred Trueman and Nat Lofthouse were talking about sport after the war until The Beatles came along,' she explains. This is sport's Golden Age, when the maximum wage, absence of a drugs culture and respect for fellow competitors meant sportspeople rarely got - to borrow a favourite Hoey-ism - too big for their boots. 'Nat Lofthouse was asked if players in his day got angry with referees. He said, \"Of course; sometimes you thought the referee was wrong, but you just accepted it\".' </p> <p>At the Stade de France two weeks ago for France v England, she saw the hosts run in a try that could have changed the game completely. 'Everybody thought it had been scored, including the French Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, who was sitting beside me; he was jumping up and down. But when the referee ruled it out, that was it. The players didn't scream and race after him; they accepted it,' recalls Hoey. 'Likewise there was huge physical contact in the game, with players walking over people, yet at the end they clapped each other off and went to dinner together. There's a professional behaviour about what happens in rugby that we just don't get in football.' </p> <p>The Minister recalls how, growing up in Northern Ireland in the Fifties, both at home and at school, 'I was taught what was right and wrong, how to behave, when to say sorry and thank you and how to both lose and win with dignity in sport. A lot of that has changed and sport is really reflecting the changes that have gone on in attitudes within society.' </p> <p>Changes in human behaviour, though, do not justify sportspeople behaving badly. Hoey is determined to reassert 'the moral dimension'. She is planning a 'summit on sportsmanship' where sports-governing bodies, and some leading stars, will produce ideas on how to get back to the time-honoured virtues of fair play and integrity. Hoey's own contribution to the debate is still in its infancy: an 'ethics charter' requiring both ruling bodies and individual sportspeople receiving National Lottery cash to display and promote proper behaviour. </p> <p>She has already held initial discussions with UK Sport about inserting an 'ethics clause' in the funding agreement signed by athletes on the World Class Performance programme, our aspiring Olympic and world champions. One condition of receiving cash would be not to cheat; UK Sport has already decided that any publicly funded competitor testing positive for drugs will never again receive public money. Another would be to show responsibility by 'putting something back' into both their sport and society as a whole. Athletes would have to visit schools, take training sessions or give drugs awareness talks on a set number of days per year. </p> <p>'Denise Lewis and Katherine Merry both do loads for Birchfield Harriers, the club in Birmingham they came up through. Judy Simpson worked with the London Coaching Foundation where she generally acted as a bit of an inspiration. Writing a requirement to do things like that into a funding agreement would make everyone realise that behaviour, responsibility and discipline is not an add-on, it's actually central to everything sport is about, if sport is to mean anything.' Amen to that. </p> <p>Hoey's big test comes soon when the Government's much-delayed new sports strategy finally emerges.

      "bodyText": "On her first day in office Kate Hoey criticised Manchester United's 'shabby' decision to forsake this season's FA Cup, prompting Martin Edwards to label her 'ignorant and disgraceful'. More headlines followed when she urged Sir Norman Foster to keep Wembley's twin towers, said she'd like to scrap the whole \u00a3475 million new national stadium and questioned the wisdom of awarding Ian Wright an MBE when he has such a dodgy disciplinary record. Not bad going for someone who, seven months after succeeding Tony Banks as Minister for Sport, says: 'I'm quite pleased that I have kept out of the news.' Hoey has recently been busy keeping out of the news again by suggesting that police officers might prosecute players who whack opponents or intimidate referees during games. Typically candid, she rejected Alex Ferguson's claim that recent misbehaviour was just 'media hype', castigated the 'appalling behaviour' of six named Premiership clubs and asked football to rediscover 'the moral dimension'. By regularly referring to 'ethics, morality and decency', she sometimes sounds more like a religious leader than her real job which, as one child put it when Hoey recently opened a new sports centre near Rotherham, is to be 'the Prime Minister of Sport'. Compared to her predecessor's jokey, laddish, easy-copy style, Hoey is downbeat and earnest. Banks was effectively the Minister for Football (especially welcome at Stamford Bridge); she intends to be the minister for all of sport. He loved photo opportunities; her preoccupation is 'helping the grassroots'. But with much of sport in disarray, it's time to get serious. Hoey admits to worrying that football's soul is being stained by the influence of money, the pricing-out of less affluent fans and, especially, player misbehaviour. 'Children mimic all these things - spitting, chasing after referees, intimidating people - because they think they're not being a proper footballer unless they do it. That's a terrible, terrible example to youngsters.' When she bemoaned spitting by footballers, 'I got at least 100 letters from people saying \"you're absolutely right\". Schoolteachers wrote saying children in their playgrounds were mimicking what they'd seen on television. Some older people wrote saying \"this didn't happen when I was playing sport\". People in other, sports such as hockey and women's football, said \"this doesn't happen in our sports\". And I don't see cricketers doing it and I don't remember seeing Stanley Matthews spitting.' So how do we stop it? She has suggested heavier fines than the current two-week maximum. Now she goes further: clubs should voluntarily drop stars who step out of line. 'The clubs have to put penalties on them; they have to be chosen not to play, ultimately. Everybody within football has to do their bit to sort the game out, including the FA, club management, PFA and players themselves. Managers shouldn't be doing anything other than taking the blame and saying \"we're sorry\" and make the players take responsibility. It's always somebody else who's responsible for what happens on the field and that blame culture in football has got to stop.' The Minister is genuinely puzzled why the national game has become so indisciplined. She ponders aloud over money, society and footballers' backgrounds as possible explanations, then discounts each one. 'I was at the Imperial War Museum the other night where Sir Stirling Moss, Sir Roger Bannister, Sir Henry Cooper, Fred Trueman and Nat Lofthouse were talking about sport after the war until The Beatles came along,' she explains. This is sport's Golden Age, when the maximum wage, absence of a drugs culture and respect for fellow competitors meant sportspeople rarely got - to borrow a favourite Hoey-ism - too big for their boots. 'Nat Lofthouse was asked if players in his day got angry with referees. He said, \"Of course; sometimes you thought the referee was wrong, but you just accepted it\".' At the Stade de France two weeks ago for France v England, she saw the hosts run in a try that could have changed the game completely. 'Everybody thought it had been scored, including the French Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, who was sitting beside me; he was jumping up and down. But when the referee ruled it out, that was it. The players didn't scream and race after him; they accepted it,' recalls Hoey. 'Likewise there was huge physical contact in the game, with players walking over people, yet at the end they clapped each other off and went to dinner together. There's a professional behaviour about what happens in rugby that we just don't get in football.' The Minister recalls how, growing up in Northern Ireland in the Fifties, both at home and at school, 'I was taught what was right and wrong, how to behave, when to say sorry and thank you and how to both lose and win with dignity in sport. A lot of that has changed and sport is really reflecting the changes that have gone on in attitudes within society.' Changes in human behaviour, though, do not justify sportspeople behaving badly. Hoey is determined to reassert 'the moral dimension'. She is planning a 'summit on sportsmanship' where sports-governing bodies, and some leading stars, will produce ideas on how to get back to the time-honoured virtues of fair play and integrity. Hoey's own contribution to the debate is still in its infancy: an 'ethics charter' requiring both ruling bodies and individual sportspeople receiving National Lottery cash to display and promote proper behaviour. She has already held initial discussions with UK Sport about inserting an 'ethics clause' in the funding agreement signed by athletes on the World Class Performance programme, our aspiring Olympic and world champions. One condition of receiving cash would be not to cheat; UK Sport has already decided that any publicly funded competitor testing positive for drugs will never again receive public money. Another would be to show responsibility by 'putting something back' into both their sport and society as a whole. Athletes would have to visit schools, take training sessions or give drugs awareness talks on a set number of days per year. 'Denise Lewis and Katherine Merry both do loads for Birchfield Harriers, the club in Birmingham they came up through. Judy Simpson worked with the London Coaching Foundation where she generally acted as a bit of an inspiration. Writing a requirement to do things like that into a funding agreement would make everyone realise that behaviour, responsibility and discipline is not an add-on, it's actually central to everything sport is about, if sport is to mean anything.' Amen to that. Hoey's big test comes soon when the Government's much-delayed new sports strategy finally emerges. 'The Prime Minister of Sport' warns that it will not be a sexy, headline-grabbing document full of flashy but half-baked initiatives. 'It will build on the good things about sport: facilities are OK, there's a lot of brilliant people working in sport, plenty of talent and more money than ever before. The trouble is that at the moment people get to the top in spite of, rather than because of, the system.' She tactfully describes the wasteful, overlapping bureaucracy that is British sports administration as 'not ideal', but too much recent upheaval means it will survive untouched. She will, though, streamline the distribution of the Lottery's millions to sport. 'Success at the top is important, but we have to get the base of sport right by providing good quality sporting opportunities for young people and ensuring everyone has a chance to fulfil their potential.' Don't expect instant results, she warns. There will be new measures to help school sport, in poor shape because of playing-field sell-offs and the downgrading of sport within the curriculum; a coaching initiative designed to narrow the skill gap between Britain and elsewhere; and some new money from the Treasury. Hoey admits that being Sports Minister involves more influence than actual power, and that frustrates her. 'You have the opportunity to say things and, on the whole, people listen.' New Labour's blueprint for sporting renewal will tell if it's worth listening.",

But this was different, now he was earning his living from the game. </p> <p>Marx now says: 'Let me tell you first about G\u00e9rard and Liverpool because it is really like a fairy-tale that has come true. After he made his name with Noeux-les-Mines, G\u00e9rard was made coach of the First Division club Lens and made me his assistant. </p> <p>'We wanted to sign a Polish player, Smolarek, of Widzew Lodz, who were due to play the return leg of a European tie against Liverpool at Anfield in 1983. </p> <p>'I got tickets for the game through my Polish connections. I could see from the start that something was getting to G\u00e9rard. He seemed very excited about something. The football, of course, was fantastic. Liverpool won 3-2, but it was not enough because they had lost the first leg 2-0 in Poland. </p> <p>'There was something else, though. It was the noise, the passion, the red-brick stadium, the little working-class houses all around. G\u00e9rard was spell-bound by the whole thing. We were from an area of industrial France where poor miners had the same feelings for the game and their team. </p> <p>'We went to a pub nearby after the game and drank a few beers. No one, of course, knew who G\u00e9rard was even though he was a top coach in France. He talked football with the fans just like he was one of them. What really impressed him was that, whereas an eliminated team got whistled in France, these supporters were still 100 per cent behind their team. </p> <p>'As we left the pub, G\u00e9rard made a remark to me that I have never forgotten. He said: \"You know, Joachim, I would love to be the coach of this club one day.\" I honestly believe G\u00e9rard never lost that dream and I am convinced that he will make Liverpool the champions of English football before he leaves them. </p> <p>'Smolarek, by the way, was too expensive and later played for Eintracht Frankfurt but, as it has turned out, it was no wasted trip for G\u00e9rard.' </p> <p>The first Kop that Houllier encountered in football was a cone-shaped hill that rises with improbable steepness behind the tiny ground of Noeux-les-Mines in northern France. It is, in fact, an old slag heap - now covered by grass. Georges Blondel, groundsman at the time, says he can still remember seeing Houllier pull up at the ground on his moped in search of a job coaching the juniors. </p> <p>Even now, the most prominent team picture in the club's cramped quarters features Houllier alongside the provincial part-timers he turned into celebrated giantkillers on a national scale. </p> <p>Marx, capped 27 times by Poland and twice a winner of their championship with Ruch Chorzow, recalls: 'G\u00e9rard was given the first team job after they had been relegated. They were in a bad way. He wasted no time in totally rebuilding the team and won promotion during his first season in charge. </p> <p>'A lot of people wondered whether G\u00e9rard had made a mistake in buying so many new players for Liverpool at the same time, but it is not the individuals who count so much for him.

What he has done at Liverpool, he already did at Noeux-les-Mines. The only difference is he knows more players, better ones and has the money to get them now. </p> <p>'G\u00e9rard gave me a three-year-contract to sign for Noeux-les-Mines from Lens when I was 35. The town has 13,000 inhabitants, there were average gates of just 800 people and, to get 5,000 in, we had to erect a temporary metal stand behind a goal. </p> <p>'We did our training three evenings a week, running all over the slag heap which served as a free vantage point for some fans on match days. What happened there in G\u00e9rard's time was simply phenomenal. Our ground would not hold the people who wanted to see us in really big cup ties. </p> <p>'We had to go to Lens to play those. There were 15,000 there to see us beat Nantes in the French Cup and 30,000 watched us lose narrowly to Paris St. Germain the next round. Can you imagine? I was used to big crowds, of course, but G\u00e9rard spent most of his time teaching English to sixth-formers in Lille; we had electricians and car mechanics in the team. </p> <p>'Some of us worked for Bernard Leroy, the club president who owned a chain of shops. I was a salesman in the kitchen furniture department for two years. They were great days. G\u00e9rard's own keenness and excitement spread through the team </p> <p>'But he hardly ever slept. He once explained to me that he had picked up the habit as a student reading his books all night. It was funny, he would drop into my house for a chat, sit on the settee and say, \"Give me five minutes.\" Then he would immediately fall asleep. His eyes would open five minutes later and we would start talking football. He used to drive my wife mad when he rang up in the middle of the night. </p> <p>'He would send me to watch the opposition for him and he could never wait until I saw him to get the information.

On the page, his characters are remarkable; in Jim Norton's performance, their realism is uncanny.</p> <p>With his impressive vocal range and his Irish intonation modulated to portray various areas of Dublin, Norton brings to life Maria singing in her quavering voice; Annie cooing 'My little mannie' to soothe her baby; little Tom pleading 'O, Pa!' to stop his father beating him; the gallant's swaggering boasts. But despite the bustle, the drinking and the music in these Dubliners' lives, what might have been is all too often a sad contrast with what is.</p> <p>Taken from original recordings of songs - scratches and all and echoing old Joe's nostalgic musing that 'there's no time like the long ago' - the music which ends each story reinforces the poignancy. Little Chandler, whose old friend has boasted about his experiences in Paris, stands at the story's conclusion feeling like 'a prisoner for life', the melancholy 'The memory of the past' voicing the aching regret in his heart.</p> <p>In another story, Mrs Mooney makes sure that Mr Doran will pay for his moment of pleasure with her daughter, Polly, by marrying her. Polly is crying upstairs until her mother calls: 'Come down, dear. Mr Doran wants to speak to you.' The song's romantic refrain, 'The love I bear for thee', contrasts painfully with the reality of Polly's future as settled for her by her mother.</p>",

On the page, his characters are remarkable; in Jim Norton's performance, their realism is uncanny. With his impressive vocal range and his Irish intonation modulated to portray various areas of Dublin, Norton brings to life Maria singing in her quavering voice; Annie cooing 'My little mannie' to soothe her baby; little Tom pleading 'O, Pa!' to stop his father beating him; the gallant's swaggering boasts. But despite the bustle, the drinking and the music in these Dubliners' lives, what might have been is all too often a sad contrast with what is. Taken from original recordings of songs - scratches and all and echoing old Joe's nostalgic musing that 'there's no time like the long ago' - the music which ends each story reinforces the poignancy. Little Chandler, whose old friend has boasted about his experiences in Paris, stands at the story's conclusion feeling like 'a prisoner for life', the melancholy 'The memory of the past' voicing the aching regret in his heart. In another story, Mrs Mooney makes sure that Mr Doran will pay for his moment of pleasure with her daughter, Polly, by marrying her. Polly is crying upstairs until her mother calls: 'Come down, dear. Mr Doran wants to speak to you.' The song's romantic refrain, 'The love I bear for thee', contrasts painfully with the reality of Polly's future as settled for her by her mother.",

      "body": "<p>Werner Herzog doesn't look like a murderer. In his spartan office in Cologne, he smiles sweetly and gazes out his office window at the peaceful waters of the Rhine. But here he is, recounting how he very nearly killed his friend, Klaus Kinski. </p> <p>'It was just a beautiful idea,' he says, 'like a beautiful screenplay with a perfect murder and alibis in all directions but it was close to reality because I was stopped very close to doing it. Shortly after that, I learned that he had equally precise, elaborate plans to kill me.' </p> <p>The director Werner Herzog and the actor Klaus Kinski were one of the most dazzling creative partnerships of the modern cinema, responsible for such epic, poetic films as Aguirre, Wrath of God and Fitzcarraldo . But their personal relationship was explosive and often violent, and they regularly brought filming to a halt with fist fights and murder threats. The feud was often thought to be just a movie legend, but more recently the full gory details have emerged. Or have they? It is difficult sometimes to separate the fact from the fiction. </p> <p>The BBC are celebrating Herzog's work in a weekend season called 'Herzog: Madman or Genius' later this month. The celebration includes Herzog's revealing documentary portrait of Kinski, My Best Fiend , which shows hitherto unseen footage of some of the actor's most violent tantrums and reveals for the first time how close the two men came to killing one another. It caused a sensation when it was screened at last year's Cannes Festival. </p> <p>When I met Herzog in Cologne last week, the city was preparing to put on its party clothes for Carnival, a five-day, drink-driven revel that loosens up even the stuffiest of Rhinelanders. But Herzog, the mad genius of poetic cinema, had no intention of entering the party spirit. 'It's terrible. You can't get any business done,' he said. </p> <p>In fact, one of the director's most striking characteristics is his controlled, soft-spoken manner and the impression he gives that most of his anecdotes and observations have been rehearsed a hundred times. As he spoke on the phone to his lawyer and fiddled with his laptop, he seemed for all the world like an ascetic chief executive dressed in baggy khakis for a working weekend. </p> <p>When Herzog began working with Kinski, in Aguirre , the actor already had a reputation for poisoning the atmosphere on every film set he entered and walking out of projects mid-shoot. Aguirre was shot in the Peruvian jungle and within a few weeks, weary of Kinski's tantrums and frequent violence, the native Indians who played the extras offered to kill the actor on Herzog's behalf. </p> <p>Herzog declined but when Kinski stormed off the set during an especially violent fit of rage and threatened to take a boat to the next town, the director took out his gun. He told him that if he stepped on to the boat, he would get eight bullets in the head. The ninth would be for Herzog himself. </p> <p>'The film was much more important than our private existences. I mean, mine and his. We knew that, both of us. And he would have violated something so deeply that I wouldn't like to have lived on as a man without dreams. I was prepared for the ultimate and I told him when this incident occurred that this was not a joke and I had made up my mind months ago. I wouldn't need a second of deliberation and this was what was going to happen next. If he took a boat, if he left, he'd be shot. I know I would have done it.' </p> <p>Kinski's rages could be sparked by anything from a lukewarm cup of coffee to a disagreement about the interpretation of a line. But, most of the time, his tantrums were a protest against anything that threatened to supplant him as the centre of attention. 'Klaus was one of the greatest actors of the century, but he was also a monster and a great pestilence. Every single day I had to think of new ways of domesticating the beast,' says Herzog. </p> <p>Although Kinski acknowledged that his best work was with Herzog - not least because the German was almost alone among more than 100 directors he worked with who could endure the actor for more than a few days - the actor was venomous about the director. </p> <p>'Big red ants should piss in his eyes, eat his balls, penetrate his asshole and eat his guts,' Kinski wrote in his crazed autobiography. 'He should get the plague. Syphilis. Malaria. Yellow fever. Leprosy. In vain. The more I wish the most horrible of deaths on him and treat him like the scum of the earth he is, the less I can get rid of him.' </p> <p>Kinski claimed in the book that he was born into such poverty that he had to wash corpses as a child and was forced to steal on behalf of his family. In fact, he came from a well-to-do family of pharmacists, but he reinvented himself so successfully as the mad poet-actor that few of his fans discovered the truth. </p> <p>Herzog was 14 years old when he first met Kinski, who moved into the Munich apartment where Herzog and his mother lived. In My Best Fiend , Herzog visits that apartment, now occupied by a prosperous, middle-aged couple and recalls Kinski's violent tantrums when his shirts were not ironed properly or when a critic's praise for one of his performances was not judged sufficiently effusive. </p> <p>'I think I was the only one who was not frightened,' Herzog recalled, 'because he was like a tornado, passing into this apartment and destroying it within the first 48 hours in a fit of rage and destroying the entire furniture and the bathroom. I believe that I was the only one who was not afraid. I was rather in stunned amazement, like somebody watching a tornado wreaking havoc on the landscape. I was fascinated.' </p> <p>Herzog attempts to be fair to Kinski by interviewing Eva Mattes and Claudia Cardinale, probably the only two actresses in the world with a kind word for him. But he makes no excuses for the fact that the film is a subjective portrait of Kinski, in keeping with his theory that documentaries should aim for what he calls 'ecstatic truth', as opposed to the 'accountant's truth' of cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9. </p> <p>'Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 basically confounds fact and truth, and the accountant's truth is what they can reach, a superficial truth. But I do believe that poetry, for example, or cinema has ways to discover a very deep, inherent truth, other strata of truth that are possible to discover,' says Herzog. </p> <p>Herzog is in Cologne to work on Invincible , his first feature film for 13 years, the story of a Jewish strongman in the 1930s which stars Tim Roth and starts shooting in Latvia in two weeks. </p> <p>For Herzog, the line between features and documentaries is blurred and, although his next three or four films will be for the cinema, he does not regret that he spent the 1990s making documentaries. </p> <p>'I was fascinated, I wanted to do them, I love what I did. And some of these works are better than any feature film I ever did. I love them. And I keep saying that Fitzcarraldo is my best documentary.' </p> <p>As a filmmaker who struggled to produce all his films himself since he started at the age of 17, Herzog has little patience for what he calls 'the culture of complaint' among many young directors. His first 12 films, including Aguirre, Wrath of God , were shot with a camera he stole from a film school in Munich and he financed his film studies by working night shifts as a welder. </p> <p>His advice to young filmmakers is to take their destiny in their own hands and to capitalise on the new opportunities offered by digital technology to make films more cheaply than ever before. </p> <p>'Nowadays, we have a technical background which makes it possible to shoot a feature film for $10,000 to $15,000. You can do it on digital video cameras. Look at the Danish, how they are doing it. You don't have to follow the rules of their manifesto, their Dogme, forget about it. But you do it yourself and if the film is really good, you'll find the money to transfer it on to real film and exhibit it in theatres. Nowadays, it is much easier to make a long feature film with enough intensity and enough imagination and a story that has some calibre.

      "body": "<p>A fresh crisis has hit British Nuclear Fuels over potentially disastrous defects in the fuel it supplies to Britain's nuclear power stations. </p> <p>The industry's safety regulator, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, has impounded four batches of uranium fuel at BNFL's Springfields manufacturing site, near Preston, because it would be unsafe to use in nuclear reactors. </p> <p>The fuel assemblies were due for dispatch to two reactors run by privatised nuclear generator British Energy, but were seized by NII inspectors last Thursday because weldings in the assemblies were cracked. </p> <p>If they had been loaded into a power station's core, radioactive material would have leaked from the containers into the reactor's cooling system, causing serious safety problems which would shut down the plant if detected. </p> <p>NII sources said that, although they did not believe there were cracked assemblies currently loaded in reactors, it could not rule out the possibility. </p> <p>The latest setback comes after the BNFL chief executive, John Taylor, was dismissed following last month's damning NII reports into the safety management failures and the falsification of quality control documents at its Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria. </p> <p>The NII will now start a fresh investigation of fuel production at Springfields. </p> <p>It will add further embar rassment to the company and the Government which has had to apologise to Japanese customers of BNFL over the falsification scandal. Ministers were incensed by the affair, and made clear they wanted Taylor out. </p> <p>One NII source said: 'This is yet more terrible news for BNFL. They don't seem to do anything right.' </p> <p>The latest revelations follow a statement on February 18 by BNFL which said current systems and processes at Springfields 'meet customer requirements'. </p> <p>An NII spokesman confirmed that it had impounded the fuel assemblies, and was keeping them in a storage facility at Springfields. 'We have taken some fuel into our possession. There may be a quality control problem in terms of welds in stainless steel cladding in fuel containers into which fuel rods are inserted.' </p> <p>He said inspectors had gone to Springfields after BNFL and British Energy alerted them to problems. </p> <p>BNFL has halted supply of fuel to seven modern Advanced Gas Cooled Reactors owned by British Energy until the NII has fully investigated the problem. </p> <p>Asked how long this would be, an NII spokesman said: 'How long is a nuclear fuel rod?' </p> <p>Nuclear industry expert Frank Barnaby said: 'This is very alarming. It poses a very serious question over quality control at BNFL and about the management systems to guarantee it. It suggests they are trying to cut down on costs and as a result cutting down on checks and safety. The fact that they reported it to the NII makes it even more odd. Normally they would set the fuel aside and repair it themselves.' </p> <p>Industry experts say there have been concerns about fuel produced at Springfields for some time, although this is the first batch to have been identified with faulty welds. </p> <p>A Greenpeace spokesman said: 'We have been worried about Springfields for some time. The bottom line is that we don't believe BNFL can produce high quality nuclear fuel.

      "bodyText": "A fresh crisis has hit British Nuclear Fuels over potentially disastrous defects in the fuel it supplies to Britain's nuclear power stations. The industry's safety regulator, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, has impounded four batches of uranium fuel at BNFL's Springfields manufacturing site, near Preston, because it would be unsafe to use in nuclear reactors. The fuel assemblies were due for dispatch to two reactors run by privatised nuclear generator British Energy, but were seized by NII inspectors last Thursday because weldings in the assemblies were cracked. If they had been loaded into a power station's core, radioactive material would have leaked from the containers into the reactor's cooling system, causing serious safety problems which would shut down the plant if detected. NII sources said that, although they did not believe there were cracked assemblies currently loaded in reactors, it could not rule out the possibility. The latest setback comes after the BNFL chief executive, John Taylor, was dismissed following last month's damning NII reports into the safety management failures and the falsification of quality control documents at its Sellafield reprocessing plant in Cumbria. The NII will now start a fresh investigation of fuel production at Springfields. It will add further embar rassment to the company and the Government which has had to apologise to Japanese customers of BNFL over the falsification scandal. Ministers were incensed by the affair, and made clear they wanted Taylor out. One NII source said: 'This is yet more terrible news for BNFL. They don't seem to do anything right.' The latest revelations follow a statement on February 18 by BNFL which said current systems and processes at Springfields 'meet customer requirements'. An NII spokesman confirmed that it had impounded the fuel assemblies, and was keeping them in a storage facility at Springfields. 'We have taken some fuel into our possession. There may be a quality control problem in terms of welds in stainless steel cladding in fuel containers into which fuel rods are inserted.' He said inspectors had gone to Springfields after BNFL and British Energy alerted them to problems. BNFL has halted supply of fuel to seven modern Advanced Gas Cooled Reactors owned by British Energy until the NII has fully investigated the problem. Asked how long this would be, an NII spokesman said: 'How long is a nuclear fuel rod?' Nuclear industry expert Frank Barnaby said: 'This is very alarming. It poses a very serious question over quality control at BNFL and about the management systems to guarantee it. It suggests they are trying to cut down on costs and as a result cutting down on checks and safety. The fact that they reported it to the NII makes it even more odd. Normally they would set the fuel aside and repair it themselves.' Industry experts say there have been concerns about fuel produced at Springfields for some time, although this is the first batch to have been identified with faulty welds. A Greenpeace spokesman said: 'We have been worried about Springfields for some time. The bottom line is that we don't believe BNFL can produce high quality nuclear fuel. ' The latest problems could wreck government plans to partly privatise BNFL by selling a 49 per cent stake. On hearing the news, one City investment banker, who knows the company well, said: 'I just don't believe this. No one in their right mind is going to touch them now.' In last month's reports, NII chief executive Laurence Williams slammed the company for falsifying quality control data for fuel shipments to Japanese power utilities. Williams said there was no excuse for the falsification, which had gone on for years in the full knowledge of management, which had done nothing to stop it. He added that plants may have to close unless major improvements were made.",

From untidy scruff to knight of the realm, the fortunes of New Zealand cricket rested squarely on his shoulders.

Sir Jack Hobbs Right-hand opening batsman (Surrey, England) 61 Test matches 1908-34: 98 of his 199 centuries were made after age of 40. Deceptively frail appearance hid iron will; first man to score more centuries than W.G. Grace. Michael Holding Fast bowler (Jamaica, Lancashire, Derbyshire, Tasmania, Canterbury, West Indies) 60 Test matches 1975-87: 249 wickets in Test cricket. Elegant bowler known as 'Whispering Death' because of his silent approach. Sir Leonard Hutton Right-hand batsman (Yorkshire, England) 79 Test matches 1937-55: 40,140 runs for Yorkshire, 19 centuries for England.

Former playboy of the Eastern world. Harold Larwood Right-arm fast bowler (Nottinghamshire, England) 21 Test matches 1926-33: on the bodyline tour took 33 wickets at 19.51. Shy, modest man who reduced Bradman to mortal status with fierce leg-theory bowling. Dennis Lillee Fast bowler (Western Australia, Australia) 70 Test matches 1971-84: won the Centenary Test for Australia in 1977 with six for 26 and five for 139. Showman bowler of outstanding skill with a vicious streak. Ray Lindwall Right-arm fast bowler (New South Wales, Queensland, Australia) 61 Test matches 1946-60: took six for 20 against England at The Oval in 1948.

Tenacious bowler, known as 'Tiger' and described by Bradman as the greatest bowler of his time. Graeme Pollock Left-hand batsman (Eastern Province, Transvaal, South Africa) 23 Test matches 1963-70: scored 64 centuries in first-class cricket. Skilled but brutal player who may well have made the record books but for South Africa's exclusion from international cricket in the late Sixties. K.S. Ranjitsinhji Right-hand batsman (Cambridge University, Sussex, England) 15 Test matches 1896-1902: passed 1,000 runs in the 12 seasons in which he appeared regularly.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Kingston's Carib cinema holds fond memories for Chris Blackwell. When he was a boy, back in the postwar era, the Carib was one of the few air-conditioned buildings offering relief from the gritty swelter of Jamaica's capital, a place literally to chill out while taking in a Tyrone Power movie or whatever US import had arrived on the boat from Florida. </p> <p>Later, the cinema became a place of hot excitement, where over-enthused ghetto youth would draw pistols and shoot at the cinematic action, ensuring that the Carib's films were viewed on a screen peppered with bullet holes. At the premiere of The Harder They Come in 1972, a crowd of 6,000 marched on the Carib, breaking down doors and muscling aside VIPs. Even the film's star, Jimmy Cliff, couldn't get in. </p> <p>The Carib is now a multiplex and a shadow of its old self, but remained the venue of choice when Blackwell, record magnate turned film producer, premiered his latest movie, Third World Cop, last year. A low-budget action yarn set amid the grainy streets and ghettos of Kingston, and spilling over with guns and reggae, Third World Cop quickly broke the Jamaican box-office records previously held by Home Alone 2 and Dancehall Queen, another Blackwell production. </p> <p>It is a small-scale triumph - with a population of around three million, Jamaica is a less important market than north London - but for Blackwell a big step in realising his dream of building an indigenous film industry with the same international appeal exercised by the island's music scene. </p> <p>As the founder of Island Records and a champion of Bob Marley, Blackwell was instrumental in bringing reggae to a global audience in the Sixties and Seventies, helping turn his tiny impoverished homeland into a cultural force. </p> <p> The ambition to pull off a similar feat via the more daunting medium of cinema at first seems misplaced - Jamaica is better known as a backdrop for Bond movies than for the score or so movies the island has made about itself - yet Blackwell is convinced he has the strategy to make it work. Sitting in the London offices of Palm Pictures, the company he established two years ago after he had sold Island to Polygram, the elegantly grizzled Blackwell exudes the confidence of an assured media operator. The key elements, he insists, are low overheads, abundance and authenticity. </p> <p>'The success of Third World Cop and Dancehall Queen in Jamaica shows there is a demand there for coherent tales of Jamaicans, speaking and being Jamaican. That's our base market. For a long time there has been the idea that you can't make a Jamaican film without bringing in a foreign star, but it has always ended up fake. My interest is to get as close as possible to the musical culture - Jamaican records make no concession to anything, they're made for the home market, yet travel round the world.' </p> <p>Perry Henzell's The Harder They Come , at least, has already achieved exactly that kind of success. With Cliff in the lead role as a tearaway, gun-toting rude boy, the movie became with Bob Marley 'the double whammy that broke Jamaican culture,' according to Blackwell. 'It didn't do it in the first week like you're meant to; it took years, but there seem to be very few people who haven't seen that film.' </p> <p>The cult appeal of The Harder They Com e, a deftly sewn crime parable with a storming soundtrack, has cast a shadow which subsequent Jamaica movies have struggled to escape. Smile Orange and Rockers in the Seventies and Countryman and The Lunatic in the Eighties all lacked its novelty, its class and the charisma of Cliff's performance. </p> <p> Dancehall Queen in 1997, directed by black Londoner Don Letts, and Third World Cop, directed by Jamaica-born Chris Browne, have fared better partly because they return to the world of drug-running, reggae and gunplay of The Harder They Come - a couple of scenes in Third World Cop pay explicit homage to Henzell's trailblazer. </p> <p> Third World Cop follows a maverick detective, Capone, as he tries to bust a gun-running racket. Capone is based on a real-life cop, Trinity (so-called because he had three lives), a personal enforcer for ex-Prime Minister Edward Seaga. Here he becomes a Jamaican Dirty Harry whose boast is 'We run tings, tings nuh run we', but whose loyalties are soon tested as his trail leads to his old ghetto spar, Ratty. </p> <p>There's plenty of shoot-em-up action, but the film's heartbeat is its vivid cameos of life in the zinc-fenced mazes of Kingston's ghettos. Carl Bradshaw, a survivor from The Harder They Come, is compelling as a ghetto don, while Mark Danvers, as the compromised Ratty, quietly steals the movie from its star, Paul Campbell (Capone). </p> <p>For Blackwell, Dancehall Queen and Third World Cop are the low-budget templates for future productions. Both movies cost around $500,000 and were shot on DVD rather than film, and both are able to present Caribbean scenarios to a wider audience. </p> <p>Jamaica, reasons Blackwell, is a natural resource for movies; packed with great stories, larger-than-life characters, dramatic backdrops and, of course, brilliant music. 'I want to bring young writers to Jamaica and let them loose. You just have to read the newspapers and go to the law courts and you will hear scenarios that you could never imagine.' He cites a true-story instance in Third World Cop , where a ghetto child leads the cops to an AK47 rifle pinned on to a clothes line inside a sheet. </p> <p>Blackwell's plan is to make Palm Pictures 'a company that specialises in seeking out low-budget movies and directors. Huge budgets smother creativity, there's no room to play, you're not taking a bloodbath financially, and you may catch some wider mood. I'm trying to get scripts and stories for two or three films a year.' </p> <p> It was his belief in small-scale operations, he claims, which lay behind his decision to sell Island. 'I like a hands-on company, and Island had become too corporatised. When someone started talking about who should be senior vice-president I lost interest. We'd become a small army, and while a guerrilla force can fight big armies, small armies have no hope.' </p> <p>Palm Pictures' current project list, however, reveals a mixture of the medium and small scale. Julian Simpson's imminent film noir, The Criminal (starring Steven Mackintosh and Eddie Izzard) cost $3.5 million, while James Toback's Black and White (starring Robert Downey Jr, Brooke Shields and Claudia Schiffer) has more then doubled its original $2m budget. 'I agreed to extend the budget to get the names,' says Blackwell, who joined forces with Sony to bankroll the movie. </p> <p>He is more animated talking about the funkier end; about Boy Shaman , a movie set in Africa to be shot by wildlife director John Dunn, and about Lockdown , a prison movie made by basketball playing African-American director Master P. 'I wanted to get experience of the American urban market, because that's the best place to cross over my Jamaican projects,' says Blackwell. 'At the time of Bob Marley and The Harder They Come the crossover route was through the white middle-class college crowd, but Jamaican music is now much closer to rap than to cultural music.' </p> <p> Third World Cop itself is already spawning two sequels. 'I loved the title because you can have follow-ups forever,' laughs Blackwell. In one, Capone takes his crime-busting skills to Toronto. The other film follows the fortunes of the two 13-year-old boys we glimpse in Third World Cop , tucking a pair of smuggled automatics in the swagger-bands of their trousers; a pair of twenty-first century ragamuffins. </p> <p>Jamaica, whose murder rate is around 1,000 a year, remains a place where life is cheap, though Blackwell insists it is no more dangerous than anywhere else; most of the crime is related to the island's role in drug-running from Central America and to its still grinding poverty. Third World Cop , though, suggests that it is at least as interesting a subject for movies as, say, South-Central LA. Blackwell, for one, is convinced. 'Making films there is actually more fun than sitting in the first world watching TV.' </p> <p><strong>Sound and vision... landmarks in Jamaican cinema</strong></p> <p><strong> The harder they come (1973)</strong> <br> Groundbreaking film starring reggae singer Jimmy Cliff. He plays country boy Ivan Martin who becomes an infamous gangster. The film is probably best known for its lively soundtrack, which helped popularise Jamaican music. </p> <p> <strong> Countryman (1982)</strong> <br> A fast-paced road movie enlivened by Jamaican folk magic. The easy-going, eponymous hero is threatened by local heavies and decides to leave town with his enemies in tow. The soundtrack features Bob Marley and the Wailers. </p> <p> <strong>The lunatic (1992)</strong> <br> Bawdy sex comedy about an amiable village simpleton who is able to converse with trees and bushes. He begins a torrid affair with a voluptuous German tourist, launching a series of strange events. Directed by Lol Creme. </p> <p>\u0095 'Third World Cop' opens in Britain on 24 March. The soundtrack is released tomorrow.</p>",

The ambition to pull off a similar feat via the more daunting medium of cinema at first seems misplaced - Jamaica is better known as a backdrop for Bond movies than for the score or so movies the island has made about itself - yet Blackwell is convinced he has the strategy to make it work. Sitting in the London offices of Palm Pictures, the company he established two years ago after he had sold Island to Polygram, the elegantly grizzled Blackwell exudes the confidence of an assured media operator. The key elements, he insists, are low overheads, abundance and authenticity. 'The success of Third World Cop and Dancehall Queen in Jamaica shows there is a demand there for coherent tales of Jamaicans, speaking and being Jamaican. That's our base market. For a long time there has been the idea that you can't make a Jamaican film without bringing in a foreign star, but it has always ended up fake. My interest is to get as close as possible to the musical culture - Jamaican records make no concession to anything, they're made for the home market, yet travel round the world.' Perry Henzell's The Harder They Come , at least, has already achieved exactly that kind of success. With Cliff in the lead role as a tearaway, gun-toting rude boy, the movie became with Bob Marley 'the double whammy that broke Jamaican culture,' according to Blackwell. 'It didn't do it in the first week like you're meant to; it took years, but there seem to be very few people who haven't seen that film.' The cult appeal of The Harder They Com e, a deftly sewn crime parable with a storming soundtrack, has cast a shadow which subsequent Jamaica movies have struggled to escape. Smile Orange and Rockers in the Seventies and Countryman and The Lunatic in the Eighties all lacked its novelty, its class and the charisma of Cliff's performance. Dancehall Queen in 1997, directed by black Londoner Don Letts, and Third World Cop, directed by Jamaica-born Chris Browne, have fared better partly because they return to the world of drug-running, reggae and gunplay of The Harder They Come - a couple of scenes in Third World Cop pay explicit homage to Henzell's trailblazer. Third World Cop follows a maverick detective, Capone, as he tries to bust a gun-running racket. Capone is based on a real-life cop, Trinity (so-called because he had three lives), a personal enforcer for ex-Prime Minister Edward Seaga. Here he becomes a Jamaican Dirty Harry whose boast is 'We run tings, tings nuh run we', but whose loyalties are soon tested as his trail leads to his old ghetto spar, Ratty. There's plenty of shoot-em-up action, but the film's heartbeat is its vivid cameos of life in the zinc-fenced mazes of Kingston's ghettos. Carl Bradshaw, a survivor from The Harder They Come, is compelling as a ghetto don, while Mark Danvers, as the compromised Ratty, quietly steals the movie from its star, Paul Campbell (Capone). For Blackwell, Dancehall Queen and Third World Cop are the low-budget templates for future productions. Both movies cost around $500,000 and were shot on DVD rather than film, and both are able to present Caribbean scenarios to a wider audience. Jamaica, reasons Blackwell, is a natural resource for movies; packed with great stories, larger-than-life characters, dramatic backdrops and, of course, brilliant music. 'I want to bring young writers to Jamaica and let them loose. You just have to read the newspapers and go to the law courts and you will hear scenarios that you could never imagine.' He cites a true-story instance in Third World Cop , where a ghetto child leads the cops to an AK47 rifle pinned on to a clothes line inside a sheet. Blackwell's plan is to make Palm Pictures 'a company that specialises in seeking out low-budget movies and directors. Huge budgets smother creativity, there's no room to play, you're not taking a bloodbath financially, and you may catch some wider mood. I'm trying to get scripts and stories for two or three films a year.' It was his belief in small-scale operations, he claims, which lay behind his decision to sell Island. 'I like a hands-on company, and Island had become too corporatised. When someone started talking about who should be senior vice-president I lost interest. We'd become a small army, and while a guerrilla force can fight big armies, small armies have no hope.' Palm Pictures' current project list, however, reveals a mixture of the medium and small scale. Julian Simpson's imminent film noir, The Criminal (starring Steven Mackintosh and Eddie Izzard) cost $3.5 million, while James Toback's Black and White (starring Robert Downey Jr, Brooke Shields and Claudia Schiffer) has more then doubled its original $2m budget. 'I agreed to extend the budget to get the names,' says Blackwell, who joined forces with Sony to bankroll the movie. He is more animated talking about the funkier end; about Boy Shaman , a movie set in Africa to be shot by wildlife director John Dunn, and about Lockdown , a prison movie made by basketball playing African-American director Master P. 'I wanted to get experience of the American urban market, because that's the best place to cross over my Jamaican projects,' says Blackwell. 'At the time of Bob Marley and The Harder They Come the crossover route was through the white middle-class college crowd, but Jamaican music is now much closer to rap than to cultural music.' Third World Cop itself is already spawning two sequels. 'I loved the title because you can have follow-ups forever,' laughs Blackwell. In one, Capone takes his crime-busting skills to Toronto. The other film follows the fortunes of the two 13-year-old boys we glimpse in Third World Cop , tucking a pair of smuggled automatics in the swagger-bands of their trousers; a pair of twenty-first century ragamuffins. Jamaica, whose murder rate is around 1,000 a year, remains a place where life is cheap, though Blackwell insists it is no more dangerous than anywhere else; most of the crime is related to the island's role in drug-running from Central America and to its still grinding poverty. Third World Cop , though, suggests that it is at least as interesting a subject for movies as, say, South-Central LA. Blackwell, for one, is convinced. 'Making films there is actually more fun than sitting in the first world watching TV.' Sound and vision... landmarks in Jamaican cinema The harder they come (1973) Groundbreaking film starring reggae singer Jimmy Cliff. He plays country boy Ivan Martin who becomes an infamous gangster. The film is probably best known for its lively soundtrack, which helped popularise Jamaican music. Countryman (1982) A fast-paced road movie enlivened by Jamaican folk magic. The easy-going, eponymous hero is threatened by local heavies and decides to leave town with his enemies in tow. The soundtrack features Bob Marley and the Wailers. The lunatic (1992) Bawdy sex comedy about an amiable village simpleton who is able to converse with trees and bushes. He begins a torrid affair with a voluptuous German tourist, launching a series of strange events. Directed by Lol Creme. \u0095 'Third World Cop' opens in Britain on 24 March. The soundtrack is released tomorrow.",

I suspect the selection procedure makes the attempts to find a mayor for London seem a mundane and straightforward operation. </p> <p>I can't pretend the names above are controversial. I chose them, Engel reminds me, because all five reached beyond the normal cricketing audience. For example, Don Bradman is treated with the same reverence in Australia as the Queen Mother generally is here. His record can't be surpassed: a century every third innings and a Test average of 99.94. He was super-efficient and a genius or, as Robertson-Glasgow rather more deftly put it, 'an artist without the handicap of an artistic temperament, a genius with an eye for business'. The nearest we have to him today, by Bradman's own assessment, is Sachin Tendulkar, another credible candidate (in all there were 49 nominations). </p> <p>Garry Sobers still generates the same feeling of awe in Barbados. And, when I was an 11-year-old in Somerset, he was the man I wanted to emulate, although I had some difficulty bowling left-handed. Even Neville Cardus, who venerated the all-rounders of his youth - Wilfred Rhodes and Frank Woolley - thought Sobers might be the best. He wrote: 'Nobody has seen Sobers obviously in labour. He makes a stroke with moments to spare. His fastest ball - and it could be very fast - is bowled as though he could, with physical pressure, have bowled it a shade faster. He can, in the slips, catch the lightning snick with the grace and nonchalance of Hammond himself. The sure sign of mastery, of genius of any order, is absence of strain, natural freedom of rhythm.' </p> <p>If legend is to be believed, Denis Compton only had to strain to get to the ground on time - sometimes clad in his dinner jacket. Compton was our post-war national hero, the 'Brylcreem Boy', who darted down the wing for Arsenal and gaily thrashed runs for Middlesex and England. His cricket mirrored the relief and joy that the War was finally over and the conviction that life was now for living. When he suffered a knee injury, the nation awaited the latest bulletin on Denis's fitness with far more interest than we now devote to Michael Owen's hamstring. But Compton was no fair-weather cricketer. Witness his courage against the pace of the Australians at Manchester in 1948. A Lindwall bumper struck his head and he had to leave the field for stitches. He returned to complete an undefeated 145; no one else passed 50. </p> <p>I may be accused of bias in my last two choices since I was a colleague of both of them at Somerset (I thought about Colin Dredge, but eventually relented). Viv Richards was the best batsman I played with or against. I have never seen anyone bat with such intensity or with the ability to will himself to score runs when it really mattered. The better the bowler the more determined Richards was to subjugate him as Bob Willis and Derek Underwood ruefully discovered. Mere survival would have been a demeaning goal for Richards, while wearing a helmet might be interpreted as a sign of frailty. Almost singlehandedly, he put Antigua on the map, not to mention Taunton. </p> <p>Ian Botham's greatest quality was that he set no limits on what he might achieve. This meant that he allowed himself to succeed - or fail - spectacularly. That takes courage; most of us settled for safe mediocrity. There was a period in the early Eighties when he was easily the most recognisable English sportsman, outstripping any of the soccer players. He was forever on the back and front pages, usually, but not always, for the right reasons. No cricketer today would make the top 20, another reason why Matthew Engel is stepping back once he's produced his Millennium Wisden. Good luck.</p>",

A chicken walks up to a pig and says: 'Hey, we should form a partnership. You provide the bacon and I'll provide the eggs.' 'Great,' says the pig, 'but I don't wanna die.' The moral of this tale is simple enough: in joint ventures, someone always gets screwed. </p> <p>I found myself thinking about pigs and chickens recently at the launch of Col Solare, a 'unique' joint venture (aren't they all?) between Chateau Sainte Michelle of Washington State and Antinori of Tuscany. Who, I wondered, would provide the bacon this time? My conclusion was that both producers were looking to lay eggs. The bacon will come from anyone foolish enough to pay \u00a355 for a bottle. </p> <p>Joint ventures are increasingly popular in the wine world. It's a neat coincidence that Opus One, the trend-creating partnership between California's Robert Mondavi and Baron Philippe de Rothschild of Ch\u00e2teau Mouton-Rothschild, has just celebrated its 20th anniversary. The success of Opus - one of the few New World wines, apart from Penfolds' Grange, to have made a serious impact on the auction scene - has encouraged a number of imitators. </p> <p>Several of these, wouldn't you know it, seem to involve Mondavi and Mouton. In the past three years, Mondavi has released Se\u00f2a (with Errzuriz) in Chile and Luce (with Frescobaldi) in Tuscany, while Mouton has launched Almaviva, a partnership with Chile's largest producer, Concha y Toro. These wines have two things in common: they're red and they're laughably over-priced. </p> <p>There's nothing wrong with a bit of ambition - too much modern wine is singularly timid - but this is madness. You could buy mature claret from a great vintage like 1986 for the price of Se\u00f2a. The same (and more) goes for Col Solare. 'We tasted the wine against the competition and thought it stacked up,' one of the winemakers told me. The wine is certainly very good - as complex as anything I've tasted from Washington State - but there are thousands of better-value wines in the world. </p> <p>The problem with joint ventures is that they invariably serve the producers' egos rather than the consumer's interests. Se\u00f2a comes from much the same vineyards as a wine called Don Maximiano (which sold at under \u00a310 a bottle not so long ago). The same thing applies to Alma Viva, which bears a considerable resemblance to Concha y Toro's Don Melchior. My conclusion is that Robert Mondavi, Mouton and Antinori think their names and expertise are worth \u00a320 a bottle or more. </p> <p>Not all joint ventures are a rip off. New Zealand giant Montana's partnerships with Cordier (for red wine) and Champagne Deutz (for fizz) have produced some genuinely interesting, well-priced wines. The same is true of Seven Peaks in California, Casa Lapostolle in Chile and D'istinto in Sicily. </p> <p>But such successes are outnumbered by the duffers, where companies have 'found their strategies incompatible' (ie they found they detested each other) or just produced mediocre wines together. Having two famous names on a label ought to be a guarantee of quality. All too often, it is nothing of the sort. </p>",

The same thing applies to Alma Viva, which bears a considerable resemblance to Concha y Toro's Don Melchior. My conclusion is that Robert Mondavi, Mouton and Antinori think their names and expertise are worth \u00a320 a bottle or more. Not all joint ventures are a rip off. New Zealand giant Montana's partnerships with Cordier (for red wine) and Champagne Deutz (for fizz) have produced some genuinely interesting, well-priced wines. The same is true of Seven Peaks in California, Casa Lapostolle in Chile and D'istinto in Sicily. But such successes are outnumbered by the duffers, where companies have 'found their strategies incompatible' (ie they found they detested each other) or just produced mediocre wines together. Having two famous names on a label ought to be a guarantee of quality. All too often, it is nothing of the sort.",

      "body": "<p>The backbone of my daily eating remains unshakably Italian. This is hardly surprising when you realise that so many of my local food shops are, or were, Italian owned. Give me 10 minutes and I could bring you anything from a fine-grained salami Milano to silken spinach tortelloni. Yet it would take me an hour or more to come up with a black pudding or an Eccles cake worth eating, and even that would have to come from the nearest Marks &amp; Spencer. But there is more to eating all' Italiana than the appeal of shopping locally. I like the simplicity of Italian cooking, its straightforwardness of preparation and, above all, its understated elegance on the plate.</p> <p>If I was pressed a little further, I would have to admit to a love of northern Italian cooking, with its abundance of butter, cheese, rice and cream. I suppose its meat and dairy produce cannot help but appear closer to our own cooking than the sun-drenched olive oil, fish and vegetable-dominated diet of the south. Perhaps there is some familiarity in its bland heartiness. One could even argue that the nannying quality of a saffron-hued risotto alla Milanese is not a stone's throw from our own beloved rice pudding. </p> <p>Forgetting the old Italian addiction to veal and frogs (whose little green heads they chop off before frying the rest whole), the cooking of Milan and its environs is my sort of food, by which I mean I feel comfortable with it. Its nurturing bean soups, blissful pork and cabbage stews and oozing, blue-veined Gorgonzola appeal every bit as much as any sun-dried tomato. Most of all, it is the silky risotti that ring my bell and, what's more, I like making them as much as eating them. Few kitchen-related jobs give me more pleasure than stirring a risotto, though I admit that for years I avoided it, obviously having spent too long listening to those scaremongers who insisted there was something difficult about it. There is not. You just need the right rice - which you can get at any supermarket - and some full-bodied stock.</p> <p>I have not eaten the eponymous risotto alla Milanese, with its flecking of saffron and knobs of beef marrow, on its home ground, but further north, in Bergamo - a creamy, almost pumpkin-coloured plateful of round rice held together with stock and cheese. One of the few occasions I get excited about saffron is when it is used with rice - in pilau, perhaps - or in fish soup, otherwise its musty flavour can too easily dominate. However, the golden crocus threads are essential to a true Milanese risotto. The beef marrow, on the other hand, is much less essential, I think. Yes, it adds a certain richness, but I am not sure I miss it when I don't include it - which, I should add, is every time. At the risk of evoking (yet again) the wrath of every purist, I use home-made chicken stock in my risotto instead of the statutory brodo di carne with its trio of beef, veal and chicken bones. The unctuousness you give to the dish by using veal stock can be obtained instead with a really good chicken version made from a fat-boned free ranger. On the other hand, I have to disagree with those who say that stock from a cube is fine for a risotto - it isn't. The whole point of the dish is the texture you get by using the right rice - Carnaroli, Arborio or Vialone nano - and good stock. The magic only happens when the chalky starch of the rice is swelled by jelly-rich stock. You just don't get that with a cube. And no, you cannot make it in the oven, no matter who tells you that you can. </p> <p>Risotto is not the only Milanese recipe that crops up in my kitchen. It is simply that it crops up more often than any other. Their way of cooking veal - lightly egged and finely crumbed, then fried briefly in butter till crisp and juicy - is just as interesting when applied to similar cuts of other meat. I have done it with pork, batting out the chop with the end of a rolling pin (for want of a cutlet bat) so that it is no thicker than a pinkie. The clever bit comes when you coat it in beaten egg and crumbs - you need a light hand with both - and fry it in butter gently so it does not burn. A splendid dish if done well. </p> <p>Classical Milanese cooking also includes polpette, the little meatballs which they flavour with ricotta and Parmesan and which I find all too easy to eat, and osso bucco, that famous braise of veal with onion and white wine, which I don't, despite its coming to the table with a mouth-popping dusting of lemon, garlic and parsley. </p> <p>On a sweet note, I must say I prefer my puddings \u00e2 l'anglaise or even French, but I do have a soft spot for panettone, the soft, vanilla-scented fruitcake you see hanging from the ceiling of every deli around Milan's via Spadari - not to mention every deli from Glasgow to Penzance. A while ago, this buttery cake was just for Christmas; now you can get it all year round. I slice and toast it, then pour over a spoonful or two of Italian mascarpone stirred through with some softly whipped double cream just to make it, and me, feel at home. </p> <p><strong>Risotto alla Milanese</strong><br> Use beef marrow if you can get it, but I must say Italian friends of mine claim that they happily use a few cubes of pancetta instead, though this is somewhat inauthentic. Serves 2</p> <p>1 shallot or small onion, finely chopped <br>75g butter <br>50g pancetta, finely chopped <br>900ml stock (beef or chicken) <br>225g risotto rice <br>1 glass of white wine <br>1 tsp saffron strands <br>50g freshly grated Parmesan</p> <p>Let the shallot cook slowly with half the butter and the chopped pancetta in a heavy-bottomed saucepan until it is translucent. Try not to let it colour. Meanwhile, put the stock into another saucepan and bring to the boil, turning it down to a virtually imperceptible simmer. Stir the rice into the onions, then pour in the wine and let it almost evaporate before adding a ladleful of stock. Sprinkle in the saffron threads and continue gently simmering until the stock starts to disappear, then ladle in more stock. As the stock is absorbed by the rice, you will see it swell and turn a beautiful, pale gold. </p> <p>Continue adding stock until the rice is thick and creamy but still has some bite left in it. This should take about 20 minutes, depending on the rice you choose. The texture you are after is one where the rice grains are still separate but bound together by a general creaminess. If it appears soft and mushy, then you have overcooked it. Season with salt, pepper and the rest of butter, stirring in the Parmesan as you bring it to the table. You can offer more if you wish.</p> <p><strong>Risotto with Gorgonzola</strong><br> I sometimes wonder whether it is Gorgonzola rather than risotto that is the best thing to come out of Lombardy. Here, you get the chance to enjoy both. Serves 2</p> <p>900ml (maybe a little more) home-made chicken stock <br>1 small onion or shallot, finely chopped <br>50g butter <br>250g risotto rice <br>1 glass of white wine</p> <p>to finish <br>1 walnut-sized lump of butter <br>250g creamy Gorgonzola</p> <p>Gently heat the stock in a saucepan. Cook the onion in the butter in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. When the onion is pale gold and soft, add the rice and stir through the butter. Pour in the wine, let it evaporate, then add about a third of the hot stock and cook gently, until the rice has absorbed almost all of the stock. Add a second third of the stock, cook slowly (again stirring regularly), then the final third. By the time almost all the stock is absorbed, the grains should be soft and plump yet with a little chalky bite to them. The total cooking time for the rice will be about 20 minutes.</p> <p>Stir in the knob of butter and the blue cheese, crumbled into small lumps. Taste and season with salt and black pepper. Serve as the cheese starts to melt. </p> <p><strong>Toasted panettone with mascarpone cream</strong><br> I have used panettone, the light, buttery Milanese cake, for everything from trifle to bread-and-butter pudding, but I prefer it simply toasted and served with cream cheese. I find mascarpone too rich to serve alone, so let it down with some softly whipped cream. You could add some grated dark chocolate, or a little orange zest. Enough for 6</p> <p>1 small panettone <br>250g tub of mascarpone <br>150ml whipping cream</p> <p>Slice the panettone and toast it lightly on both sides. Meanwhile, whip the cream until it will stand in soft waves, then carefully fold it into the mascarpone. Serve the toasted panettone with the mascarpone cream.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Our garden here is appallingly situated in relationship to the house, with the house stuck in one corner like an afterthought - except that someone thought it at least 700 years before I had the notion of the garden. It was built in an age when gardens were small and enclosed and primarily utilitarian, and the setting of the building was in a context where the river, tracks, parish boundaries, and the initial impression as you approached it, mattered far more than the inward relationship with the garden. Nowadays, though, gardens are a private landscape, to screen off the rest of the world as much as to stop it peering at us. </p> <p>Outside our back door is a small brick yard with the garden swinging into a dog leg much longer than the dog. But there is room for a slither of a garden beyond the door. It is not quite 30 yards long, tapering away from 10 yards wide at the bricked end, to two. At this time of year, it invites you across the yard with a glimpse of snowdrops, hellebores, catkins and crocuses.</p> <p>By June, this light, airy funnel becomes a green tunnel, the almost permanent shade spangled with light, as the wind shifts the branches like the twitch of lace curtains. Spring is its season. The snowdrops have done their bit (and a good bit it was, too), although I feel snowdrop-greedy and want them to mass right over the wider top half. The hellebores are fantastic, without question the stars of the garden at this time of the year, although I can not seem to grow Helleborus foetidus with the degree of success that I would like. </p> <p>The first of the perennials to flower are the lungworts. We only have two types: there is the Pulmonaria officinalis 'Sissinghurst White', which has icy little flowers and leaves which look as though someone has spattered milk over them and it has dried, leaving a faded stain (lungwort is sometimes known as 'Mary-spilt-the-milk'). Leaves and stem are both covered in tiny hairs, soft as rabbits' ears with the grain, and as bristly as a pig's ear against it. We also have Pulmonaria angustifolia, which has violet flowers growing out of chocolate calyxes that look remarkably like dried seed heads until this very un-dried-up flower emerges.</p> <p>Lungwort is so-called because the blotches on the leaves were seen to be a sympathetic indication of diseased lungs, and the name pulmonaria derives from the Latin pulmo, for lung. I have no memory of buying these plants, although it is worth hunting out good varieties. P angustifolia subspecies azurea, P longifolia (which is a rare native of the Isle of Wight and the New Forest), P saccharata 'Boughton Blue' and P 'Lewis Palmer' are all a rich violet-blue, although pulmonarias often start pink, turning bluer as they develop. I don't like the truly pink, almost apricot pulmonarias, but purely for prejudicial reasons. P rubra is a soft red, as are 'Margery Fish' and 'Leopard', and I am sure that they are much loved in their various homes. They grow best in cool shade and are ideally suited to a patch at the base of deciduous shrubs. They need splitting every two or three years, both to propagate new plants and to reinvigorate the old. They have a habit of growing vigorously outwards while dying back in the centre, forming a hollow ring which will promptly fill with weeds.</p> <p>Another famously blue flower in the season of yellows is Corydalis flexuosa. This is one of my favourites, both for the incredible china blue of its flowers and its glaucous leaves that have a trembling fragility, yet it is a common enough plant and not difficult to grow. It is a close relation of the poppy and dicentra and also the common fumitory. Its blue flowers will retain a freshness and intensity of colour if they are grown in cool shade, which suits the plant anyway. C flexuosa only came from China in 1989, though it seems to have been around for ever. Although it likes moisture, it also needs good drainage but does not want to be too dry. Cool woodland is ideal and any border with shrubby deciduous plants and soil rich in organic matter qualifies perfectly. A hot summer will trigger a period of dormancy, so give it maximum shade to keep it flowering. There are a number of strains you can buy, such as 'China Blue', 'Blue Panda' and 'Pere David', which has bronzish leaves.</p> <p>The yellow-flowering Corydalis lutea has effectively naturalised itself through its ability to grow happily on seemingly bare limestone walls. We have one behind a drain that seems very settled and happy there. Corydalis ochroleuca has creamy flowers tipped with yellow and has the same unfussy spreading habits as flexuosa but is less bullish about its occupancy so should be encouraged wherever it pops up. I don't grow it, but this has prompted me to put it on my list of must-haves.</p> <p>Dicentras have similar leaves to corydalis and the best known varieties also come from China. This is bleeding heart. Dicentra spectabilis has little pink, heart-shaped flowers hanging in a neat row from its arching stem. The white version, D spectabilis 'Alba', is good and contrasts better with the glaucous leaves. Like the corydalis, dicentra is an essentially spring plant and I cannot imagine the season without it. I find that in our little spring garden it fulfils this almost celebratory, ritual function without any need for elaboration, but D formosa has a number of cultivars, with flowers working on variations of pink.</p> <p>Despite pulling it up almost as fast as it spreads, our forget-me-nots (Myosotis sylvatica) were already flowering sporadically in early February. By April, they will be a misty blue haze shimmering above soil-level. It is technically a perennial but is effectively a biennial and seeds itself so prolifically that it should be treated as such. The major problem with forget-me-nots is the white powdery mildew that they often get from midsummer on. This is entirely due to drought, and if they are kept cool and moist it will not appear.</p> <p>And seeding almost equally freely, albeit in a less rumbustious manner, are the aquilegias, whose tight rosettes of leaf are appearing everywhere. Their time is a month or two off, but when they are out, this spring garden is at its peak, which is wonderful but also tinged with sadness, as from there it slips into a midsummer green dotage. There are lots of other things to flower between now and then and lots of things left to write about another day, but just as I invariably find when I am planting in this sliver of garden, I have run out of space. </p> <p><strong>Thompson &amp; Morgan special offer</strong></p> <p>Observer readers can buy a dicentra collection consisting of two D spectabilis and two D formosa for 14.99, inc.

But yesterday, eight days after a tragedy of biblical proportions swept across the villages and towns of Mozambique, the controversial British military relief effort to a country sinking under water was still nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>Four RAF British Puma helicopters that have been at the centre of a coruscating political row between the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development are still in pieces at an airbase in South Africa - unable to fly until tomorrow at the earliest.</p> <p>The ground crew for the Pumas - who arrived in an advance party at South Africa's Hoedspruit airforce base, set in the rolling tropical bush at the edge of the Kruger national park, have been pictured relaxing in the sun and reading.</p> <p>Yesterday, the only British soldiers in Maputo, capital of a country whose economy and infrastructure have in one week been set back a generation, were slowly unpacking their satellite phones in the office of the British High Commission.</p> <p>And what they will be doing now that the flood waters are beginning to clear - for the time being, at least - is not entirely clear. They were sent out to join the search-and-rescue missions scouring the country but yesterday the search-and-rescue phase was declared all but over, finished before the British pilots could join in.</p> <p>Meanwhile the officer in charge of the British forward party, Colonel Jonathan Downes, admitted he had no experience of disaster relief. Instead he described his background in logistics in Germany and the UK - not in search-and-rescue.</p> <p>And Downes had a further confession to offer. The Pumas - when they finally arrive - may be able to offer some assistance, but not where it is most needed in the country's north. The helicopters, he admitted, lacked even the range of the South African Orexs, whose aircrew have spent a week valiantly plucking stranded villagers from trees and rooftops.</p> <p>How did it all go so wrong? In less than a week - the time it has taken the rains to obliterate a large part of an African country - what should have been good reason to celebrate Britain's swift commitment to the relief effort in Mozambique has been submerged in accusations of incompetence and marred by political rows between International Development Secretary Clare Short and her old enemy from her Birmingham days, the Defence Minister John Spellar.</p> <p>For despite the best efforts of the Department for International Development (DfID) - which had been labouring almost alone in Mozambique since the first flood warnings came early in January until disaster hit late last Saturday night - the British effort has become mired in public recriminations.</p> <p>In Downing Street yesterday the frustration was palpable, not only that the relief programme was proving so slow to reach the victims of disaster but that Britain's role at the forefront of the relief effort was being undermined by the tit-for-tat briefing war between the MoD and DfID.</p> <p>At the centre of the row has been the willingness of the MoD to make its helicopters available to DfID - and at what price.</p> <p>'Instead of getting credit for being there first with 11 of the 14 helicopters in the region,' said one Downing Street source, 'we are now embroiled in a row like this.'</p> <p>To the frustration of the Prime Minister, the row over Mozambique has been tainted by other personal and departmental animosities. Bad blood has been raised in recent months between the two departments over arms exports. Privately, MoD officials blame DfID for leaking juicy details of Whitehall battles over MoD's willingness to sponsor arms sales to Indonesia and Zimbabwe.</p> <p>The personal element has been equally destructive. The pipe-smoking Defence Minister John Spellar, a former right-hand man of the vehemently anti-communist electricians union leader, Frank Chapple, has little in common with Short, a free spirit from the Left with a history of unilateralism.</p> <p>Their swords first crossed in the murky world of Birmingham Labour politics prior to the 1992 general election, when Short accused the electricians of using their block votes to mount a deselection challenge in her Birmingham Ladywood seat. Spellar, MP for Birmingham Northfield, has boasted in private about his union's role.</p> <p>The first sign that problems existed between the two departments - problems that would lead to the tardy deployment of the British helicopters - emerged last Monday in the Commons as the full enormity of the disaster in Mozambique was made clear by the British media.</p> <p>In the House to give a statement on the crisis, Short had outlined the already considerable work her department had undertaken in the previous weeks, including the hiring of helicopters for the World Food Programme, using British money.</p> <p>But the first indication of the trouble ahead came as Spellar interrupted her when she reported that the MoD had said it had no resources within 3,000 miles and therefore could not help directly - a claim that Short has stuck to resolutely.</p> <p>But even as Short and Spel lar were sparring over availability of helicopters for Mozambique, and how long it would take to get them there - a second damaging issue had arisen: how much the MoD was asking for the use of its aircraft.</p> <p>By Tuesday the MoD - which had by now found four Pumas and five Seakings on a Royal Fleet Auxiliary in the Indian Ocean - was saying it wanted to charge \u00a32.2 million, to be reimbursed by the DfID, for the use and transfer of the Pumas.</p> <p>This price, the MoD would claim later, included the cost of the charter of a Russian Antonov transporter to fly them to Africa.</p> <p>What happened next is at the centre of the controversy. The MoD claims it asked the Treasury if it could charge DfID just the 'marginal' cost of sending the helicopters, but was denied - a claim disputed by the Treasury, which says it was always happy for the MoD to incur the full cost.</p> <p>Either way, an angry Short argued that the cost was excessive and that she would look for cheaper helicopters that were more quickly deployable.</p> <p>But as Short explained this to the Commons, she was not aware - or did not say - that the MoD had gone ahead and hired an Antonov to take the helicopters to South Africa.</p> <p>The next chapter in the saga appears to have been the final straw. For even as the MoD was arranging to get its aircraft to Mozambique and offering to discount the price its officials began briefing vigorously against Short, claiming that it was she, not the MoD, that was ultimately responsible for the delay.</p> <p>By now Short's officials were warning Downing Street that she had had enough and was likely to express her frustration, which she duly did on Thursday morning, exposing the embarrassing division to a startled British public which had been digging deep in its pockets to help the victims of the floods.</p> <p>Yesterday the rescue helicopters - the British ones excepted - continued to search for survivors, but now they have to journey further afield to remote locations. As many as a million have been displaced from their homes and it is anyone's guess how many are still stranded.</p> <p>'There are still parts of the country that are badly covered by the helicopters,' says Roy Trivedi, a regional representative of Save The Children.</p> <p>More than a third of the country, to the north, remains unexplored by rescue teams. Trivedi says: 'There is a logistical problem Helicopters have to refuel somewhere, and up there we don't yet have those facilities for them. So rescue teams are having to sit tight until extra help arrives.'</p> <p>Criticism over the pace of the international community's response has already begun to emerge in Mozambique. Among the critics are foreign minister Leonardo Simao: 'The aid was slow to come. We had our first floods on 6 February. Our first appeal for international aid was on 10 February. Only now is aid coming in its visible form.</p> <p>'If the response had been more quick, I believe that more lives could have been saved.'</p> <p>The official death toll remains at just over 200 but there is little doubt that it really runs into the thousands. Simao said that landmines scattered during the country's brutal civil war that ended eight years ago have been dislodged and moved by the floods and will add to the threat from starvation and disease once the waters subside.</p> <p>Mozambique President Joachim Chissano has also been vocal in his criticism of the speed of the Western response in recent days. Despite that, it is also clear that not a single Mozambican soldier has been deployed to rescue efforts in the flooded areas. Five of the country's military helicopters sit at one end of Maputo airport's runway. Four of them are said to be unserviceable.</p> <p>Instead it has been helicopters from neighbouring South Africa that have provided the backbone of the rescue efforts. The crews have laboured tirelessly to pull people from the water, trees and roofs. The last time South African helicopters clattered across Mozambique in such numbers was during the apartheid era to attack African National Congress bases or to deliver supplies to Renamo rebels.</p> <p>But the key to limiting the damage to Mozambique's economy will also be the rapid rebuilding of its infrastructure, particularly the roads and railways which provide vital trade links to its neighbours. Last year Mozambique produced its first food surplus since independence from Portugal 25 years ago.</p> <p>Now it has lost about eight months worth of crops and President Chissano is pleading for relief from the $1.4m a week Mozambique pays to service its debt, and for tens of millions of pounds to rebuild.</p> <p>Mozambique is often heralded as the great African success story. It has the fastest growing economy in the world. Maputo is transformed from a dormant, bureaucratic maze of a Marxist state into a vibrant, reborn African city. But the vast majority of Mozambique's 17 million people have yet to feel the benefits.</p> <p>More than 70 per cent live in traditional huts in rural areas. According to last year's census, most do not have piped water, electricity or sanitation. Life expectancy is just 42 years.</p> <p>Mozambique has an appalling infant mortality rate, although it is better than two decades ago. The average woman bears six children. Aids is rife. The literacy rate is just 40 per cent.</p> <p>Up until now, the country's government was laying the economic ground to change all that. Whether the floods wreck these ambitious plans will depend on whether Western generosity is diverted once the waters subside and the television cameras leave Mozambique.</p> <p>Already at least one offer is on the table - from Clare Short - who yesterday announced that the British Government would be giving Mozambique \u00a370m over the next two years to help rebuild its infrastructure.</p> <p><b> If you want to give money to the Mozambique Emergency Appeal, call the credit card hotline: 0345 312 312 (24-hours;local rate)</b></p> <p><b>\u00a325 </b> is enough to save 250</p> <p>children by treating them with anti malaria drugs;</p> <p><b> \u00a350 </b> could help save 300</p> <p>children suffering from cholera or dysentry by treating them with rehydration salts</p> <p><b> \u00a375 </b> is enough to buy 800 water purification tablets and give 800 children one litre of clean water</p> <p><b>Donations can be posted to: Unicef Mozambique Children's Emergency Appeal Unicef, Room SAF, Freepost, Chelmsford, Essex CM2 8BR</b></p> <p>Cheques/postal orders made payable to Unicef</p> <p><b> Registered charity number: 1072612</b></p>",

For despite the best efforts of the Department for International Development (DfID) - which had been labouring almost alone in Mozambique since the first flood warnings came early in January until disaster hit late last Saturday night - the British effort has become mired in public recriminations. In Downing Street yesterday the frustration was palpable, not only that the relief programme was proving so slow to reach the victims of disaster but that Britain's role at the forefront of the relief effort was being undermined by the tit-for-tat briefing war between the MoD and DfID. At the centre of the row has been the willingness of the MoD to make its helicopters available to DfID - and at what price. 'Instead of getting credit for being there first with 11 of the 14 helicopters in the region,' said one Downing Street source, 'we are now embroiled in a row like this.' To the frustration of the Prime Minister, the row over Mozambique has been tainted by other personal and departmental animosities. Bad blood has been raised in recent months between the two departments over arms exports. Privately, MoD officials blame DfID for leaking juicy details of Whitehall battles over MoD's willingness to sponsor arms sales to Indonesia and Zimbabwe. The personal element has been equally destructive. The pipe-smoking Defence Minister John Spellar, a former right-hand man of the vehemently anti-communist electricians union leader, Frank Chapple, has little in common with Short, a free spirit from the Left with a history of unilateralism. Their swords first crossed in the murky world of Birmingham Labour politics prior to the 1992 general election, when Short accused the electricians of using their block votes to mount a deselection challenge in her Birmingham Ladywood seat. Spellar, MP for Birmingham Northfield, has boasted in private about his union's role. The first sign that problems existed between the two departments - problems that would lead to the tardy deployment of the British helicopters - emerged last Monday in the Commons as the full enormity of the disaster in Mozambique was made clear by the British media. In the House to give a statement on the crisis, Short had outlined the already considerable work her department had undertaken in the previous weeks, including the hiring of helicopters for the World Food Programme, using British money. But the first indication of the trouble ahead came as Spellar interrupted her when she reported that the MoD had said it had no resources within 3,000 miles and therefore could not help directly - a claim that Short has stuck to resolutely. But even as Short and Spel lar were sparring over availability of helicopters for Mozambique, and how long it would take to get them there - a second damaging issue had arisen: how much the MoD was asking for the use of its aircraft. By Tuesday the MoD - which had by now found four Pumas and five Seakings on a Royal Fleet Auxiliary in the Indian Ocean - was saying it wanted to charge \u00a32.2 million, to be reimbursed by the DfID, for the use and transfer of the Pumas. This price, the MoD would claim later, included the cost of the charter of a Russian Antonov transporter to fly them to Africa. What happened next is at the centre of the controversy. The MoD claims it asked the Treasury if it could charge DfID just the 'marginal' cost of sending the helicopters, but was denied - a claim disputed by the Treasury, which says it was always happy for the MoD to incur the full cost. Either way, an angry Short argued that the cost was excessive and that she would look for cheaper helicopters that were more quickly deployable. But as Short explained this to the Commons, she was not aware - or did not say - that the MoD had gone ahead and hired an Antonov to take the helicopters to South Africa. The next chapter in the saga appears to have been the final straw. For even as the MoD was arranging to get its aircraft to Mozambique and offering to discount the price its officials began briefing vigorously against Short, claiming that it was she, not the MoD, that was ultimately responsible for the delay. By now Short's officials were warning Downing Street that she had had enough and was likely to express her frustration, which she duly did on Thursday morning, exposing the embarrassing division to a startled British public which had been digging deep in its pockets to help the victims of the floods. Yesterday the rescue helicopters - the British ones excepted - continued to search for survivors, but now they have to journey further afield to remote locations. As many as a million have been displaced from their homes and it is anyone's guess how many are still stranded. 'There are still parts of the country that are badly covered by the helicopters,' says Roy Trivedi, a regional representative of Save The Children. More than a third of the country, to the north, remains unexplored by rescue teams. Trivedi says: 'There is a logistical problem Helicopters have to refuel somewhere, and up there we don't yet have those facilities for them. So rescue teams are having to sit tight until extra help arrives.' Criticism over the pace of the international community's response has already begun to emerge in Mozambique. Among the critics are foreign minister Leonardo Simao: 'The aid was slow to come. We had our first floods on 6 February. Our first appeal for international aid was on 10 February. Only now is aid coming in its visible form. 'If the response had been more quick, I believe that more lives could have been saved.' The official death toll remains at just over 200 but there is little doubt that it really runs into the thousands. Simao said that landmines scattered during the country's brutal civil war that ended eight years ago have been dislodged and moved by the floods and will add to the threat from starvation and disease once the waters subside. Mozambique President Joachim Chissano has also been vocal in his criticism of the speed of the Western response in recent days. Despite that, it is also clear that not a single Mozambican soldier has been deployed to rescue efforts in the flooded areas. Five of the country's military helicopters sit at one end of Maputo airport's runway. Four of them are said to be unserviceable. Instead it has been helicopters from neighbouring South Africa that have provided the backbone of the rescue efforts. The crews have laboured tirelessly to pull people from the water, trees and roofs. The last time South African helicopters clattered across Mozambique in such numbers was during the apartheid era to attack African National Congress bases or to deliver supplies to Renamo rebels. But the key to limiting the damage to Mozambique's economy will also be the rapid rebuilding of its infrastructure, particularly the roads and railways which provide vital trade links to its neighbours. Last year Mozambique produced its first food surplus since independence from Portugal 25 years ago. Now it has lost about eight months worth of crops and President Chissano is pleading for relief from the $1.4m a week Mozambique pays to service its debt, and for tens of millions of pounds to rebuild. Mozambique is often heralded as the great African success story. It has the fastest growing economy in the world. Maputo is transformed from a dormant, bureaucratic maze of a Marxist state into a vibrant, reborn African city. But the vast majority of Mozambique's 17 million people have yet to feel the benefits. More than 70 per cent live in traditional huts in rural areas. According to last year's census, most do not have piped water, electricity or sanitation. Life expectancy is just 42 years. Mozambique has an appalling infant mortality rate, although it is better than two decades ago. The average woman bears six children. Aids is rife. The literacy rate is just 40 per cent. Up until now, the country's government was laying the economic ground to change all that. Whether the floods wreck these ambitious plans will depend on whether Western generosity is diverted once the waters subside and the television cameras leave Mozambique. Already at least one offer is on the table - from Clare Short - who yesterday announced that the British Government would be giving Mozambique \u00a370m over the next two years to help rebuild its infrastructure. If you want to give money to the Mozambique Emergency Appeal, call the credit card hotline: 0345 312 312 (24-hours;local rate) \u00a325 is enough to save 250 children by treating them with anti malaria drugs; \u00a350 could help save 300 children suffering from cholera or dysentry by treating them with rehydration salts \u00a375 is enough to buy 800 water purification tablets and give 800 children one litre of clean water Donations can be posted to: Unicef Mozambique Children's Emergency Appeal Unicef, Room SAF, Freepost, Chelmsford, Essex CM2 8BR Cheques/postal orders made payable to Unicef Registered charity number: 1072612",

      "body": "<p>Try to remember this set of initials: CMGi. Few people in Europe have heard of the company, but it is perhaps the most talked about Internet business in the United States at the moment. Its reputation as an Internet investment vehicle is mercurial, a fact reflected in the jaw dropping pace at which its share price has headed upwards. </p> <p>CMGi has been the best performing stock in the US over the last five years. If you had invested $100 in CMGi when it floated in 1994, you would now be sitting on a paper fortune of around $80,000 (\u00a350,000). Today the company, which last year had a turnover of $500 million and has stakes in more than 60 Internet companies, is worth almost $40 billion. And soon it will be over here - over-financed and over-acquisitive - under its European head, a former manager of the rock band Genesis. </p> <p>CMGi's stellar reputation is cited as one of the reasons why Richard Li, the new media entrepreneur and founder of 10-month-old Pacific Century Cyber Works, was this week able to initiate a merger with Cable &amp; Wireless HKT, beating off the more established SingTel in the process (See opposite page). The fact that Li's business has an alliance with CMGi helped to convince C&amp;W's chief executive, Graham Wallace, of the bid's credibility. </p> <p>Last week CMGi cemented its relationship with Li when, in conjunction with US venture capital firm Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst, it launched a $1.5bn global investment fund called @Ventures Global Partners. </p> <p>CMGi likes to see itself as a hybrid, a venture capital firm that offers more of a 'hands on' incubator fund approach: an active adviser to its investments. 'Some companies like Softbank [the Internet venture capital firm] have portfolios of interests, others, like Microsoft, have a variety of companies which they manage. We have both,' said Marcus Bicknell, president of CMGi, Europe. </p> <p>A cursory glance at the company's CV, however, might make more staid members of the investment community run for the hills. For a start, it began life as a direct marketing company. </p> <p>Under the guidance of its chief executive officer, David Wetherell, the College Marketing Group initially concentrated on selling college course lists to textbook publishers. </p> <p>By 1993, however, as the World Wide Web was taking off, Wetherell, a former software engineer, had realised how technology could help his business. His idea was to sell books through PCs. This required the creation of a Web browser whose construction immediately excited the interest of America Online. Wetherell sold the browser to AOL in return for shares in the online company. </p> <p>Wetherell then focused the business on Internet technology companies. Lycos, the search engine in which CMGi has almost a 20 per cent stake, was one of his first investments. The fact that Lycos's share price plunged soon after CMGi took a stake alarmed Wetherell's co-directors and at one stage he nearly took the company private. </p> <p>The company's investors, who saw the value of their shares rise by 870 per cent last year alone, will be glad that he didn't. Today CMGi (the name is derived from its Nasdaq ticket symbol) is capable of doing mega deals on the strength of its shares. The most high profile example of this came last year when it bought 83 per cent of the Alta Vista portal from computer giant Compaq for $2.3bn. </p> <p>Wetherell's image as an Internet investment guru has earned him from Bicknell the epithet of 'the man who puts his money where his mouse is'. </p> <p>And Wetherell's reputation as a decisive investor is matched by the speed at which he makes management decisions. Bicknell who, after managing Genesis between 1969 and 1971 went on to become European head of A&amp;M Records, helped establish Star TV in the Far East and worked on the launch of BBC World, explains how Wetherell recruited him following a speech at a media industry event. 'He came up to me and said \"When do you start?\" I said \"I've never heard of you\". He said \"Here's the salary, here are the stock options, this is what we do\".' </p> <p>CMGi's success on Wall Street has spawned imitators.

      "bodyText": "Try to remember this set of initials: CMGi. Few people in Europe have heard of the company, but it is perhaps the most talked about Internet business in the United States at the moment. Its reputation as an Internet investment vehicle is mercurial, a fact reflected in the jaw dropping pace at which its share price has headed upwards. CMGi has been the best performing stock in the US over the last five years. If you had invested $100 in CMGi when it floated in 1994, you would now be sitting on a paper fortune of around $80,000 (\u00a350,000). Today the company, which last year had a turnover of $500 million and has stakes in more than 60 Internet companies, is worth almost $40 billion. And soon it will be over here - over-financed and over-acquisitive - under its European head, a former manager of the rock band Genesis. CMGi's stellar reputation is cited as one of the reasons why Richard Li, the new media entrepreneur and founder of 10-month-old Pacific Century Cyber Works, was this week able to initiate a merger with Cable &amp; Wireless HKT, beating off the more established SingTel in the process (See opposite page). The fact that Li's business has an alliance with CMGi helped to convince C&amp;W's chief executive, Graham Wallace, of the bid's credibility. Last week CMGi cemented its relationship with Li when, in conjunction with US venture capital firm Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst, it launched a $1.5bn global investment fund called @Ventures Global Partners. CMGi likes to see itself as a hybrid, a venture capital firm that offers more of a 'hands on' incubator fund approach: an active adviser to its investments. 'Some companies like Softbank [the Internet venture capital firm] have portfolios of interests, others, like Microsoft, have a variety of companies which they manage. We have both,' said Marcus Bicknell, president of CMGi, Europe. A cursory glance at the company's CV, however, might make more staid members of the investment community run for the hills. For a start, it began life as a direct marketing company. Under the guidance of its chief executive officer, David Wetherell, the College Marketing Group initially concentrated on selling college course lists to textbook publishers. By 1993, however, as the World Wide Web was taking off, Wetherell, a former software engineer, had realised how technology could help his business. His idea was to sell books through PCs. This required the creation of a Web browser whose construction immediately excited the interest of America Online. Wetherell sold the browser to AOL in return for shares in the online company. Wetherell then focused the business on Internet technology companies. Lycos, the search engine in which CMGi has almost a 20 per cent stake, was one of his first investments. The fact that Lycos's share price plunged soon after CMGi took a stake alarmed Wetherell's co-directors and at one stage he nearly took the company private. The company's investors, who saw the value of their shares rise by 870 per cent last year alone, will be glad that he didn't. Today CMGi (the name is derived from its Nasdaq ticket symbol) is capable of doing mega deals on the strength of its shares. The most high profile example of this came last year when it bought 83 per cent of the Alta Vista portal from computer giant Compaq for $2.3bn. Wetherell's image as an Internet investment guru has earned him from Bicknell the epithet of 'the man who puts his money where his mouse is'. And Wetherell's reputation as a decisive investor is matched by the speed at which he makes management decisions. Bicknell who, after managing Genesis between 1969 and 1971 went on to become European head of A&amp;M Records, helped establish Star TV in the Far East and worked on the launch of BBC World, explains how Wetherell recruited him following a speech at a media industry event. 'He came up to me and said \"When do you start?\" I said \"I've never heard of you\". He said \"Here's the salary, here are the stock options, this is what we do\".' CMGi's success on Wall Street has spawned imitators. Bicknell says CMGi's secret is that it views its investments holistically, not separately. Each acquisition is viewed in terms of how it would benefit or benefit from CMGi's existing portfolio of investments. CMGi has made investments in companies across the Internet spectrum. It has stakes in businesses which specialise in content, infrastructure and e-commerce. Content draws the punters in, allowing CMGi to make money from them once they are on the Web. Bicknell describes the approach as pragmatic. 'Content doesn't make money. We give that away free. What makes money is advertising and e-commerce,' he said. So, for example, a Web surfer could click into Alta Vista and then visit Thingworld.com, an online collectibles site (35 per cent owned by CMGi). From this site the surfer could then check out online jewellery seller Mondera.com, another CMGi investment. Ads on many of the sites visited will be sold by Adsmart. The effectiveness of the ads will be monitored by Adforce, which like Adsmart, is 90 per cent owned by CMGi. Wherever the surfer goes CMGi lurks in the background, often suggesting services which are owned by... yes, you've guessed it. 'While the dot com companies are the public face, we're making money underneath. Every company in the group has three or four contracts with other companies in the group,' Bicknell said. And while the user has been surfing its websites, CMGi has been learning about what he or she likes to visit, allowing it to build up a profile which can then be used to create bespoke advertising and services for individual users. Of course, the problem is that a Web surfer might bypass Alta Vista altogether and thus become irrelevant to CMGi's virtuous circle business plan. No surprise, then, that Wetherell talks of turning the search engine into a 'megaportal', one which surfers would be compelled to visit. This also explains why a major marketing campaign promoting Alta Vista Europe is now underway.

      "bodyText": "Nawaz Sharif, the deposed Prime Minister of Pakistan, will appear before a Karachi court tomorrow on hijacking and terrorism charges without his top defence lawyer and is facing new accusations by the military regime of corruption. Sharif's entire defence team quit in protest at the judge's handling of the case last week amid allegations that Pakistan's generals have been piling pressure on the judiciary for a favourable verdict. On Friday, all Sharif's lawyers agreed to return to the trial, except Ijaz Batalvi, his leading counsel and one of the country's most senior lawyers. 'I will be present only on account of the insistence of my client,' said Khwaja Sultan, one of the defence team. 'Nawaz Sharif felt it would not be possible for anyone else to represent him.' Now Sharif, who was over thrown in a military coup in October, is also facing two separate accusations of corruption at different courts. More investigations are expected to follow. Sharif, 52, is accused of not paying tax on his purchase in 1993 of a $2 million Russian helicopter, which he used for electioneering. He has also been ordered to appear before a court in Lahore to answer charges that in 1994 a family business, the Ittefaq foundry, defaulted on a loan from the state-run National Bank of Pakistan worth 729m rupees (\u00a38.5m). Two of his brothers, Shahbaz and Abbas, are also accused in the Ittefaq case. Sharif has been held in detention for the past five months and was formally charged only in January, when his trial began at an anti-terrorism court in Karachi. Sharif, Shahbaz and five former senior government officials have pleaded not guilty to charges of hijacking, kidnap ping, attempted murder and terrorism related to the night of the coup. They face the death penalty if convicted. Hours before he was overthrown, Sharif sacked his army chief, General Pervez Musharraf, who was flying back into Pakistan after a trip abroad. Prosecutors claim Sharif ordered that the Pakistan International Airlines jet carrying the general should be refused permission to land, even though it was running low on fuel, thus endangering the lives of all 198 people on board. Musharraf landed after troops seized Karachi airport and, within hours, he had taken over the country. Defence lawyers insist Sharif acted only after the army launched a coup. Just before the defence was due to open its case, Judge Rehmat Hussain Jafri ruled that some of Sharif's evidence may not be released to the public on national security grounds. The defence team promptly quit, accusing the judge of censorship. 'The whole world for the last two months heard the prosecution malign and scandalise Sharif and now, when it was his turn to tell the truth, he has been asked to shut up,' Batalvi said. 'To say the least, this is not justice.' His complaints were echoed by the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Lawyers on both sides expect the case to end this month. Sultan, now the leading defence counsel, insisted he was under no pressure from the generals. 'Throughout the trial there has never been any pressure from the military regime and I don't think the judge is under pressure,' he said. 'There is every chance of my client being acquitted.' Although Sharif faces the death penalty, few observers here believe the military regime would carry out the sentence.",

But those who lived through the overvaluations of 1979-81 and 1990-92 will not have been surprised at all. Every time the competitiveness of British industry is threatened by an absurdly 'strong' pound, all sides argue that 'this time it is different'. How many times have you read recently that 'industry is adapting well' to it, or that 'exports are holding up well'. </p> <p>Are they? The best guide to the trend of overseas trade is provided by the volume figures for 'total trade excluding oil and erratics'. 'Erratics' are items such as aircraft which are not exported or imported regularly, and which can seriously distort one month's figures. There was the famous episode in May 1970 when the import of two jumbo jets made the trend of the trade figures look a lot worse than it was - which was thought to have contributed to Labour's unexpected general election defeat that year. </p> <p>The value of oil exports has obviously been boosted by the recent rise in the oil price. Stripping out these categories, one finds that in the last quarter of 1999, Britain's exports plunged at an annual rate of almost 10 per cent, while imports rose at an annual rate of nearly 11 per cent (both in volume terms). It is reassuring that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee has now fully got the message about the pound's overvaluation. Last Tuesday's MPC evidence to the Treasury Committee was dominated by the subject. </p> <p>Some weeks earlier the Bank's Governor, Eddie George, had warned bankers: 'The most immediate challenges relate to the build-up of imbalances within and between the major industrial countries. </p> <p>'The US and the UK are already operating close to overall capacity, with ultimately unsustainable growth of domestic demand offset by already sizeable external current account deficits.' </p> <p>With due respect to New Labour, the importance of the US economy to the rest of the world far outweighs the importance of the UK. When currency traders finally panic about the extent to which the US is living on tick and not practising what it preaches to, say, East Asia, all hell will be let loose. But this week let us stick with the UK's little local imbalances. In his earlier speech George effectively said he could see no good underlying economic reason why capital was flowing into this country (thereby driving up the exchange rate). And it was clear at the Treasury committee session that the MPC is now Talking the Pound Down. </p> <p>One reason for the combination of unsustainably rapid growth in domestic demand and a deteriorating overseas trade (and investment) situation lies with the all too successful U-turn by the MPC in the autumn and winter of 1998-99. That was when many feared we were to be plunged into the third recession in 20 years. The MPC not only began cutting interest rates aggressively; it also made no secret of the fact that, because the overseas trade picture was deteriorating, its job, under its remit from the Chancellor, was to stimulate domestic demand so that inflation did not fall below 2.5 per cent. </p> <p>In the event, the output of the economy as a whole stagnated for a while, but did not fall. It is still a puzzle why there was such a rapid turnaround. We were always told that monetary policy worked with long and variable lags. But the lags experienced last winter and spring were very short indeed. We were also always told that economic policy is essentially about confidence - Keynes's 'animal spirits'. Between them the Chancellor and the MPC pulled off quite a confidence trick in averting recession and achieving rapid economic growth again. </p> <p>Yes, the MPC stimulated domestic demand, and how!

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Tony Blair's favoured way of describing the closeness of his relationship with Gordon Brown is as 'a marriage'. It's going through a rocky patch. You have not read about this - at least not until now - because one thing the Prime Minister and Chancellor learnt from the early turmoils of this Government was to draw the curtains before they threw crockery at each other.</p> <p>Since Peter Mandelson's exile to the other side of the Irish Sea and the departure of Charlie Whelan, the outside world has observed only sweetness and light between Tony and Gordon. Yet, if anything, the differences between Blair and Brown, a struggle for supremacy which goes to the heart of the purpose of this Government, is wider than ever.</p> <p>Their noisiest recent row - a humdinger, I'm told - was over the TV licence fee. Gordon wanted to introduce the supplement for owners of digital sets proposed by Gavyn Davies, the Chancellor's multi-millionaire friend and partner of his assistant, Sue Nye. But Tony was turned off by the idea of a digital licence. Rupert Murdoch slipped into Number 10 at the beginning of February to be given two hours of the Prime Minister's time to lobby against making digital, in which the media mogul has a massive investment, more expensive. I doubt there was a crude threat to the Prime Minister that the Sun would go down on him were the Government to impose the digital licence. These conversations tend to be more subtle.</p> <p>And the digital licence had many other opponents, inside and outside Government. For a combination of reasons, the Prime Minister concluded that extra resources for the BBC should come from an increase to everyone's licence. Brown fought a protracted, fierce battle against this, partly because he feared it would be attacked by the Tories as another of his 'stealth taxes'. To Brown's not inconsiderable fury, Blair overruled him.</p> <p>The small number of people at Number 10 and the Treasury aware of this story tell it with some wonderment. At the Treasury, it's muttered against the Prime Minister that his thraldom to the proprietor of News International led him to veto his Chancellor. At Number 10, the astonishment is that, for once, Blair insisted on getting his way with Brown.</p> <p>If this is a marriage, it conforms to the old maxim about couples. Blair makes the life-and-death decisions: how to proceed in Northern Ireland; whether Britain should fight in Kosovo. Brown makes all the trivial decisions - in other words, the truly significant ones - about money. Blair has left himself dependent on Brown, not least because the Prime Minister's grasp of economics is light. Blair's interventions in Brown's empire are exceptional. A senior civil servant tells me that he has never known a Prime Minister to make fewer demands on the Treasury reserve.</p> <p>The strength accumulated by the Chancellor will be vividly demonstrated in a fortnight's time. With his customary rabbit-pulling skill, Brown will use his Budget to produce tax lollies here and spending dollops for needy services there before sitting down to a thunderous ovation from the Labour backbenches. The Chancellor's poll chart may soar even higher. His approval ratings are already higher than the wilting score of the Prime Minister. And what may have started to dawn on Blair is that Brown has been purchasing popularity at the expense of the Prime Minister. While Iron Gordon has brilliantly positioned himself to garland all the plaudits for running a sound economy, it is Tony Blair who gets all the grief for being a tightwad towards public services.</p> <p>Blair is a victim of the self-generated myth that he has created a presidential system of government. Sure, he wanted to. Yes, the Cabinet rarely gets consulted about any question more significant than whether they want one lump or two. There is a concentration of power at the top, but the master controller is not Blair. It's Brown. Under the aegis of his spending reviews, and by tying departments to his performance targets, the Chancellor has made every other Minister accountable and beholden to the Treasury. He whistles; they beg.</p> <p>He's binding them even more tightly through a mechanism known as SR 2000. This is the review which will determine spending into the year 2004. Rather too late, Blair's advisers have realised that this effectively leaves the Chancellor to write nearly all the important chapters of the next manifesto. Brown will decide what the Government will do - and won't - well into the second term.</p> <p>While no one was looking - has the Prime Minister even spotted it? - all of Tony Blair's ambitions for his government have become the prisoners of his Chancellor. Entry into the single currency will be determined by Brown's assessment of whether his five economic tests have been passed. Blair is in a box on Europe which only Brown can unlock. Another great project the Prime Minister set himself is the modernisation of health and education. Brown's consuming interest is welfare and work. These agendas do not have to be in conflict, but they are competitors for resources.</p> <p>The winner of this competition has been the Chancellor. Billions of pounds have been poured into his New Deal schemes, and the child tax credit to be introduced in the Budget will give him direct control over another large slice of welfare spending. Health and education - Blair's interests - have been on a financial starvation diet.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair's favoured way of describing the closeness of his relationship with Gordon Brown is as 'a marriage'. It's going through a rocky patch. You have not read about this - at least not until now - because one thing the Prime Minister and Chancellor learnt from the early turmoils of this Government was to draw the curtains before they threw crockery at each other. Since Peter Mandelson's exile to the other side of the Irish Sea and the departure of Charlie Whelan, the outside world has observed only sweetness and light between Tony and Gordon. Yet, if anything, the differences between Blair and Brown, a struggle for supremacy which goes to the heart of the purpose of this Government, is wider than ever. Their noisiest recent row - a humdinger, I'm told - was over the TV licence fee. Gordon wanted to introduce the supplement for owners of digital sets proposed by Gavyn Davies, the Chancellor's multi-millionaire friend and partner of his assistant, Sue Nye. But Tony was turned off by the idea of a digital licence. Rupert Murdoch slipped into Number 10 at the beginning of February to be given two hours of the Prime Minister's time to lobby against making digital, in which the media mogul has a massive investment, more expensive. I doubt there was a crude threat to the Prime Minister that the Sun would go down on him were the Government to impose the digital licence. These conversations tend to be more subtle. And the digital licence had many other opponents, inside and outside Government. For a combination of reasons, the Prime Minister concluded that extra resources for the BBC should come from an increase to everyone's licence. Brown fought a protracted, fierce battle against this, partly because he feared it would be attacked by the Tories as another of his 'stealth taxes'. To Brown's not inconsiderable fury, Blair overruled him. The small number of people at Number 10 and the Treasury aware of this story tell it with some wonderment. At the Treasury, it's muttered against the Prime Minister that his thraldom to the proprietor of News International led him to veto his Chancellor. At Number 10, the astonishment is that, for once, Blair insisted on getting his way with Brown. If this is a marriage, it conforms to the old maxim about couples. Blair makes the life-and-death decisions: how to proceed in Northern Ireland; whether Britain should fight in Kosovo. Brown makes all the trivial decisions - in other words, the truly significant ones - about money. Blair has left himself dependent on Brown, not least because the Prime Minister's grasp of economics is light. Blair's interventions in Brown's empire are exceptional. A senior civil servant tells me that he has never known a Prime Minister to make fewer demands on the Treasury reserve. The strength accumulated by the Chancellor will be vividly demonstrated in a fortnight's time. With his customary rabbit-pulling skill, Brown will use his Budget to produce tax lollies here and spending dollops for needy services there before sitting down to a thunderous ovation from the Labour backbenches. The Chancellor's poll chart may soar even higher. His approval ratings are already higher than the wilting score of the Prime Minister. And what may have started to dawn on Blair is that Brown has been purchasing popularity at the expense of the Prime Minister. While Iron Gordon has brilliantly positioned himself to garland all the plaudits for running a sound economy, it is Tony Blair who gets all the grief for being a tightwad towards public services. Blair is a victim of the self-generated myth that he has created a presidential system of government. Sure, he wanted to. Yes, the Cabinet rarely gets consulted about any question more significant than whether they want one lump or two. There is a concentration of power at the top, but the master controller is not Blair. It's Brown. Under the aegis of his spending reviews, and by tying departments to his performance targets, the Chancellor has made every other Minister accountable and beholden to the Treasury. He whistles; they beg. He's binding them even more tightly through a mechanism known as SR 2000. This is the review which will determine spending into the year 2004. Rather too late, Blair's advisers have realised that this effectively leaves the Chancellor to write nearly all the important chapters of the next manifesto. Brown will decide what the Government will do - and won't - well into the second term. While no one was looking - has the Prime Minister even spotted it? - all of Tony Blair's ambitions for his government have become the prisoners of his Chancellor. Entry into the single currency will be determined by Brown's assessment of whether his five economic tests have been passed. Blair is in a box on Europe which only Brown can unlock. Another great project the Prime Minister set himself is the modernisation of health and education. Brown's consuming interest is welfare and work. These agendas do not have to be in conflict, but they are competitors for resources. The winner of this competition has been the Chancellor. Billions of pounds have been poured into his New Deal schemes, and the child tax credit to be introduced in the Budget will give him direct control over another large slice of welfare spending. Health and education - Blair's interests - have been on a financial starvation diet. People at Number 10 talk wistfully of what they might have done for schools and hospitals with the \u00a35 billion a year that the Chancellor is ploughing into his working families tax credit. It gets better for Brown. Blair takes the brickbats for the state of the NHS, as he did when the Prime Minister exposed himself to the wrath of health professionals and patients on Newsnight. When the Chancellor produces a spending boost for the NHS in the Budget, he will Hoover up the bouquets. Even more beautifully, from where the Chancellor is sitting, he's weaved the illusion, to which many on the Left have succumbed, that Red Gordon is the socialist soul of the Government who would do so much more for Labour's traditional supporters if only he were not stopped by Tory Blair. Let me tell you about the minimum wage. It was Brown who wanted it frozen. The TUC General Secretary, John Monks, and other trades unionists got no joy from the Chancellor. They were received much more sympathetically by the Prime Minister. Anxious about the mounting discontent in the Labour heartlands, Blair decided that the minimum wage should be raised.

His populist touch is as sure here as it has been elsewhere. But increasingly he fears that the election is being stolen from him by the Republican money-machine which has anointed Bush.</p> <p>As the contest moved back to New York on Friday, a Texas businessman who is one of Bush's biggest contributors, said he had paid for $2 million for television commercials in New York and other primary states that criticised McCain and promoted Bush's record on clean air. The businessman, Sam Wyly, who recently sold a software company he co-owned for $3.9 billion, said he and his family paid for the advertising to draw attention to environmental issues. But McCain's aides accused the Bush campaign of being behind the advertising, which was scurrilous and part of a broader attempt to steal the campaign.</p> <p>But it is California, with its 38 million citizens, which is the heart of Super Tuesday, and therefore of American politics over the next four years. And Orange County - fortress of the serious Republican Right - is its core. Although 17 states poll on Tuesday, neither candidate can survive the loss of California.</p> <p>Even if McCain takes the the other mega-state, New York, he needs California too if he is to barnstorm his campaign into the last round, 'Southern Tuesday' comprising Texas and Florida. Bush, conversely, must establish his authority among hardline Republicans to enter he final count as the party's favourite son.</p> <p>Bush is at once the familiar figure and the mystery in this campaign. Son of the ex-Presidentwhose career he has sought to duplicate, he is one of America's very few aristocrats; ubiquitous, he has a high-profile life behind him, and yet he remains something of an enigma. The question is 'What is George Bush?'</p> <p>In 1998, the FBI in California opened a file on a curious case - the purchase of a boat from a financial consultant, Christopher Bower. Bower had sold the 47-footer to Tom Hicks, a Texas businessman who had never seen it, for $300,000 - $45,000 more than the original price. Bower had just advised the California state employees' pension fund to invest $100 million in Hicks's web of companies. Another $100m followed. The Feds found no reason to proceed, but the case afforded a peep into a remarkable empire built by Bush.</p> <p>He is selling himself to voters in California as a man with a record of government in Texas. Yet he introduced himself to politics while he was an unsuccessful businessman drafted in to work for his father in Washington in 1987. From then on, Bush's inauspicious businesses developed a Midas touch, as powerful interests in Texas jostled for proximity to the son of presidential power. His small oil company, Harken, won a miraculous contract in Bahrain. Bush was able to harvest the resultant bonanza, only to unload his stock just in time before a 24 per cent price crash.</p> <p>His tiny share in the Texas Rangers baseball team was mutated by a consortium of others into a high-profile and lucrative association worth $15 million.</p> <p>But Tom Hicks the boat-buyer, one of the wealthiest men in Texas, was the man who really made Bush - and vice-versa. In return for a hefty donation to his gubernatorial campaign coffers, Hicks was made a regent of the University of Texas Board.</p> <p>As such, Hicks revolutionised the way in which the university invested its funds, 'privatising' some $9 million of assets into a new investment management company, Utimco, which also guaranteed good salaries for Hicks and his fellow regents on the Board.</p> <p>Utimco soon went into politics. The company placed $10 million with the Carlyle Group merchant bank in Washington, whose chairman was Frank Carlucci, Ronald Reagan's former Defence Secretary. Governor 'Junior' Bush has a seat on Carlyle's board.</p> <p>The Republican Party likes this kind of synergy between politics, family and finance. This is why Bush personifies not only industrial and financial interests but with them the power elites on Capitol Hill and in governors' mansions across the country - elites that cannot and will not see him go down to a man who threatens their very raison d' etre .</p> <p>Before Bush's candidature was made known publicly, some of the heaviest financial hitters in the land decided that Bush was the man to get their party back into the White House, come what may.</p> <p>Word went out that Bush would stand, and fundraising began. Bush thus managed to amass the largest electoral war chest America has ever seen - some $70 million. The spending has been giddy, almost reckless, but until Bush's victory in the Virginia and Washington primaries last week largely ineffectual against McCain.</p> <p>On Tuesday comes the moment when Bush's backers need to get what they are paying for: California. The coffers are now down to a reported $10 million, so to win California, The Observer is told, the drive against McCain has begun 'borrowing' from reserves earmarked to combat the Vice-President in the next race, to the White House.</p> <p>But the Bush juggernaut can never run out of the essential fuel. It has too many friends in too many high places for that - especially in southern California.</p> <p>Brad 'Fargo' Freeman, a merchant banker and multi-millionaire who likes to squire supermodels around Beverly Hills, is part of what Bush's campaign finance manager Don Evans calls 'a grassroots, broad-based individual effort across America'. Freeman, like 200,000 others, gave the maximum of $1,000.</p> <p>But Freeman is also chairman of Bush's finance committee in California, and a leading 'Pioneer' - that is, one of a core working for Bush who manage a particular system of campaign finance manipulation which he has elevated into a fine art. It is called 'bundling': in addition to giving 'soft money' to the Republican Party, these 'Pioneers' get thousands of others to give their individual $1,000 to the candidate too. The system is simple: memoranda, circulars, phone calls and petition forms sent unsolicited around clients, employees, friends and contacts - urging them to join the club and support 'W'. Bush. The staff of entire companies has been invited to support the boss by helping his candidate.</p> <p>California is of central symbolic as well as statistical importance in Tuesday, as home state of the man to whom George Bush Senior owed his career and whose legacy the son now claims - Ronald Reagan. But there's a twist: so does John McCain. McCain calls himself 'a proud Reagan Republican', while Bush calls his policies as 'Reaganesque'.</p> <p>The choice of the Gipper is one of a figurehead, a man seen as the quintessential 'Un-Clinton', a Hollywood cowboy hero who united America on a wave of patriotic fervour, and who did so by winning the crucial middle ground - middle ground the Republicans have since lost.</p> <p>This is becoming the theme at the kernel of the struggle between Bush's big-buck backers and McCain's challenge: the fact that, while Bush consolidates the Republican vote, McCain - especially after his withering attack on the Christian Coalition this week - is appealing further and further afield across the political spectrum.</p> <p>The result - in California and beyond - is one that could blow the Republican Party apart: it is an 'open' primary inasmuch as all registered voters can poll for whoever they wish, but 'closed' inasmuch as only registered Republicans' votes will count towards the primary nomination result, and likewise for Democrats.</p> <p>So there are two votes: the 'party' and 'popular' vote - the Republican nightmare is that Bush wins the former while McCain takes the latter.</p> <p>Bush could emerge as the man with the party powerhouse interests and delegates behind him sufficient to win the nomination but lose the White House. McCain, meanwhile, would command the popular mandate and the polling power to beat Al Gore.</p> <p>Whatever happens across the nation on Super Tuesday, it is in California that America will see itself in the mirror.</p>",

Bush, conversely, must establish his authority among hardline Republicans to enter he final count as the party's favourite son. Bush is at once the familiar figure and the mystery in this campaign. Son of the ex-Presidentwhose career he has sought to duplicate, he is one of America's very few aristocrats; ubiquitous, he has a high-profile life behind him, and yet he remains something of an enigma. The question is 'What is George Bush?' In 1998, the FBI in California opened a file on a curious case - the purchase of a boat from a financial consultant, Christopher Bower. Bower had sold the 47-footer to Tom Hicks, a Texas businessman who had never seen it, for $300,000 - $45,000 more than the original price. Bower had just advised the California state employees' pension fund to invest $100 million in Hicks's web of companies. Another $100m followed. The Feds found no reason to proceed, but the case afforded a peep into a remarkable empire built by Bush. He is selling himself to voters in California as a man with a record of government in Texas. Yet he introduced himself to politics while he was an unsuccessful businessman drafted in to work for his father in Washington in 1987. From then on, Bush's inauspicious businesses developed a Midas touch, as powerful interests in Texas jostled for proximity to the son of presidential power. His small oil company, Harken, won a miraculous contract in Bahrain. Bush was able to harvest the resultant bonanza, only to unload his stock just in time before a 24 per cent price crash. His tiny share in the Texas Rangers baseball team was mutated by a consortium of others into a high-profile and lucrative association worth $15 million. But Tom Hicks the boat-buyer, one of the wealthiest men in Texas, was the man who really made Bush - and vice-versa. In return for a hefty donation to his gubernatorial campaign coffers, Hicks was made a regent of the University of Texas Board. As such, Hicks revolutionised the way in which the university invested its funds, 'privatising' some $9 million of assets into a new investment management company, Utimco, which also guaranteed good salaries for Hicks and his fellow regents on the Board. Utimco soon went into politics. The company placed $10 million with the Carlyle Group merchant bank in Washington, whose chairman was Frank Carlucci, Ronald Reagan's former Defence Secretary. Governor 'Junior' Bush has a seat on Carlyle's board. The Republican Party likes this kind of synergy between politics, family and finance. This is why Bush personifies not only industrial and financial interests but with them the power elites on Capitol Hill and in governors' mansions across the country - elites that cannot and will not see him go down to a man who threatens their very raison d' etre . Before Bush's candidature was made known publicly, some of the heaviest financial hitters in the land decided that Bush was the man to get their party back into the White House, come what may. Word went out that Bush would stand, and fundraising began. Bush thus managed to amass the largest electoral war chest America has ever seen - some $70 million. The spending has been giddy, almost reckless, but until Bush's victory in the Virginia and Washington primaries last week largely ineffectual against McCain. On Tuesday comes the moment when Bush's backers need to get what they are paying for: California. The coffers are now down to a reported $10 million, so to win California, The Observer is told, the drive against McCain has begun 'borrowing' from reserves earmarked to combat the Vice-President in the next race, to the White House. But the Bush juggernaut can never run out of the essential fuel. It has too many friends in too many high places for that - especially in southern California. Brad 'Fargo' Freeman, a merchant banker and multi-millionaire who likes to squire supermodels around Beverly Hills, is part of what Bush's campaign finance manager Don Evans calls 'a grassroots, broad-based individual effort across America'. Freeman, like 200,000 others, gave the maximum of $1,000. But Freeman is also chairman of Bush's finance committee in California, and a leading 'Pioneer' - that is, one of a core working for Bush who manage a particular system of campaign finance manipulation which he has elevated into a fine art. It is called 'bundling': in addition to giving 'soft money' to the Republican Party, these 'Pioneers' get thousands of others to give their individual $1,000 to the candidate too. The system is simple: memoranda, circulars, phone calls and petition forms sent unsolicited around clients, employees, friends and contacts - urging them to join the club and support 'W'. Bush. The staff of entire companies has been invited to support the boss by helping his candidate. California is of central symbolic as well as statistical importance in Tuesday, as home state of the man to whom George Bush Senior owed his career and whose legacy the son now claims - Ronald Reagan. But there's a twist: so does John McCain. McCain calls himself 'a proud Reagan Republican', while Bush calls his policies as 'Reaganesque'. The choice of the Gipper is one of a figurehead, a man seen as the quintessential 'Un-Clinton', a Hollywood cowboy hero who united America on a wave of patriotic fervour, and who did so by winning the crucial middle ground - middle ground the Republicans have since lost. This is becoming the theme at the kernel of the struggle between Bush's big-buck backers and McCain's challenge: the fact that, while Bush consolidates the Republican vote, McCain - especially after his withering attack on the Christian Coalition this week - is appealing further and further afield across the political spectrum. The result - in California and beyond - is one that could blow the Republican Party apart: it is an 'open' primary inasmuch as all registered voters can poll for whoever they wish, but 'closed' inasmuch as only registered Republicans' votes will count towards the primary nomination result, and likewise for Democrats. So there are two votes: the 'party' and 'popular' vote - the Republican nightmare is that Bush wins the former while McCain takes the latter. Bush could emerge as the man with the party powerhouse interests and delegates behind him sufficient to win the nomination but lose the White House. McCain, meanwhile, would command the popular mandate and the polling power to beat Al Gore. Whatever happens across the nation on Super Tuesday, it is in California that America will see itself in the mirror.",

About 175 Albanian women, children and older men fled over the nearby border into Kosovo after the shooting began in Dobrosin just after midnight.

And in Andr\u00e9 Gide's The Vatican Cellars an atheist becomes a religious fanatic because his lumbago disappears after he has prayed. Coates believes he has examples of answered prayer to match. Pop star John Lodge, of the Moody Blues, is a neighbour and was prayed for by his congregation during an illness seven years ago. 'I phoned him at the end of the evening meeting and he said he had been feeling a lot better since 8.30. He had no idea that was when we were praying,' said Coates. Jonathan Aitken, the disgraced former Conservative Minister, was also involved in an answered prayer. Coates said: 'He had started praying with me in Westminster and one day, as I parked elsewhere in London, I wondered if I should invite him to pray with me. As I looked up he was walking past and said he had just written to ask if he could pray with me.' Coates is eager to show prayer plays a bigger part in people's lives than they know. 'It is worth remembering that a much larger percentage of people pray than go to church.' \u0095 Email Vanessa Thorpe at vanessa.thorpe@observer.co.uk",

But last night Fayed said Rees-Jones did not have 'a scrap of fresh information' about the tragedy. He was 'talking rubbish, rewriting history _ in an attempt to deflect blame from Trevor's own part in what happened.' He said Rees-Jones was exploiting the crash to sell his memoirs and make thousands of pounds.</p> <p>'I am saddened and disappointed that Trevor has chosen to tell his story in this way,' Fayed said. 'While I have great sympathy for him - he went through hell - there are limits. I would have expected better of him than to exploit the Paris tragedy.</p> <p>'I always paid him very well and he was always well treated by me and my family. He owes me a duty of confidentiality and I would hope a debt of gratitude for all I did to help him after the crash.</p> <p>'Trevor made no criticism at all of Dodi at the time he was helping the inquiry - that came after he left my employment in May 1998. I can only see these criticisms raised so long after the event as an attempt to deflect blame from Trevor's own part in what happened.'</p> <p>In an interview with the Daily Telegraph yesterday to publicise his forthcoming book on the tragedy, Rees-Jones said Dodi was arrogant and reckless - repeatedly and cynically breaking the basic rules of security over Diana. He made plans on the hoof, changed his mind halfway through journeys, travelled without security back-up and frequently overruled bodyguards Fayed had assigned to Diana. It was he who made the arrangements that led to drunken security man Henri Paul driving Diana's limousine into the Paris tunnel at high speed.</p> <p>He dismissed as 'ridiculous' the conspiracy theories Fayed put forward to explain the tragedy. 'I still sympathise with him for losing his son. But I can't sympathise with him for accusing Prince Philip of murdering Dodi and the Princess, or me of not doing my job properly.</p> <p>The biography, The Bodyguard's Story , will re-ignite the dispute over how and why Diana died. Ever since the tragedy two-and-a-half years ago Fayed has tried to blame MI5, the 'racist British Establishment', the Israeli secret service and an unidentified Frenchman in a white Fiat Uno. He has criticised Diana's security men and furiously denied claims that the driver of the limousine, Ritz security chief, Henri Paul, was drunk. But Rees-Jones, who suffered facial injuries in the accident, has pinned the blame firmly on Dodi.</p> <p>Rees-Jones said he was planning to confront Dodi once the Princess had left Paris. 'I was going to say: \"You've got to give us more information or get someone else in to do the job.\"'</p> <p>On the night Diana died, Rees-Jones claims, Dodi changed the procedure for leaving The Ritz. He told Henri Paul to steer the limousine out of a concealed hotel exit to avoid paparazzi. To make Diana's getaway even more low-key, Dodi decided against having the usual back-up car. Even though the plan ran counter to accepted security practice, Rees-Jones said Dodi assured him it had been approved in London by Fayed. The Harrods owner later denied the claim.</p> <p>Rees-Jones also criticised Fayed's London security headquarters. During the Mediterranean holiday when the press were circling Fayed's yacht Rees-Jones called Fayed in London to ask for back-up. 'They could send sand to Finland,' Rees-Jones recalls, 'but they can't send a few extra blokes to help us.' Fayed denies he received the calls.</p> <p>Rees-Jones said he did not confront Dodi before the crash because Dodi was wilful and could have simply disappeared with Diana. 'If I had put my foot down, Dodi would have gone on his own. Working in the private sector, you haven't got the power. You can advise, you can try to point them in the right direction, but he who pays the wages...'</p> <p>In yesterday's interview Rees-Jones told how he is still haunted by the knowledge that Diana died 'on my shift'. He said he would have traded his own life for hers and the two other victims, Dodi and Paul. 'If I could have died and those three survived I would have done it. If I could have done something ... I go mad thinking about if onlys.'</p> <p>He still has nightmares about what happened in the Paris underpass. 'It happens even now. I'll be asleep and then Boof! I'll be awake suddenly, sitting up in bed remembering. I can wake up after six hours' sleep and be absolutely exhausted, my brain running round and round.'</p> <p>Rees-Jones started work for Fayed in 1995 at \u00a325,000 a year. They parted company acrimoniously when Fayed became exasperated at Rees-Jones's inability to remember details of the crash. Fayed has since accused him of failing to do his job properly.</p> <p>\u0095 Email John Arlidge at <a href=\"mailto:john.arlidge@observer.co.uk\">john.arlidge@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

He was 'talking rubbish, rewriting history _ in an attempt to deflect blame from Trevor's own part in what happened.' He said Rees-Jones was exploiting the crash to sell his memoirs and make thousands of pounds. 'I am saddened and disappointed that Trevor has chosen to tell his story in this way,' Fayed said. 'While I have great sympathy for him - he went through hell - there are limits. I would have expected better of him than to exploit the Paris tragedy. 'I always paid him very well and he was always well treated by me and my family. He owes me a duty of confidentiality and I would hope a debt of gratitude for all I did to help him after the crash. 'Trevor made no criticism at all of Dodi at the time he was helping the inquiry - that came after he left my employment in May 1998. I can only see these criticisms raised so long after the event as an attempt to deflect blame from Trevor's own part in what happened.' In an interview with the Daily Telegraph yesterday to publicise his forthcoming book on the tragedy, Rees-Jones said Dodi was arrogant and reckless - repeatedly and cynically breaking the basic rules of security over Diana. He made plans on the hoof, changed his mind halfway through journeys, travelled without security back-up and frequently overruled bodyguards Fayed had assigned to Diana. It was he who made the arrangements that led to drunken security man Henri Paul driving Diana's limousine into the Paris tunnel at high speed. He dismissed as 'ridiculous' the conspiracy theories Fayed put forward to explain the tragedy. 'I still sympathise with him for losing his son. But I can't sympathise with him for accusing Prince Philip of murdering Dodi and the Princess, or me of not doing my job properly. The biography, The Bodyguard's Story , will re-ignite the dispute over how and why Diana died. Ever since the tragedy two-and-a-half years ago Fayed has tried to blame MI5, the 'racist British Establishment', the Israeli secret service and an unidentified Frenchman in a white Fiat Uno. He has criticised Diana's security men and furiously denied claims that the driver of the limousine, Ritz security chief, Henri Paul, was drunk. But Rees-Jones, who suffered facial injuries in the accident, has pinned the blame firmly on Dodi. Rees-Jones said he was planning to confront Dodi once the Princess had left Paris. 'I was going to say: \"You've got to give us more information or get someone else in to do the job.\"' On the night Diana died, Rees-Jones claims, Dodi changed the procedure for leaving The Ritz. He told Henri Paul to steer the limousine out of a concealed hotel exit to avoid paparazzi. To make Diana's getaway even more low-key, Dodi decided against having the usual back-up car. Even though the plan ran counter to accepted security practice, Rees-Jones said Dodi assured him it had been approved in London by Fayed. The Harrods owner later denied the claim. Rees-Jones also criticised Fayed's London security headquarters. During the Mediterranean holiday when the press were circling Fayed's yacht Rees-Jones called Fayed in London to ask for back-up. 'They could send sand to Finland,' Rees-Jones recalls, 'but they can't send a few extra blokes to help us.' Fayed denies he received the calls. Rees-Jones said he did not confront Dodi before the crash because Dodi was wilful and could have simply disappeared with Diana. 'If I had put my foot down, Dodi would have gone on his own. Working in the private sector, you haven't got the power. You can advise, you can try to point them in the right direction, but he who pays the wages...' In yesterday's interview Rees-Jones told how he is still haunted by the knowledge that Diana died 'on my shift'. He said he would have traded his own life for hers and the two other victims, Dodi and Paul. 'If I could have died and those three survived I would have done it. If I could have done something ... I go mad thinking about if onlys.' He still has nightmares about what happened in the Paris underpass. 'It happens even now. I'll be asleep and then Boof! I'll be awake suddenly, sitting up in bed remembering. I can wake up after six hours' sleep and be absolutely exhausted, my brain running round and round.' Rees-Jones started work for Fayed in 1995 at \u00a325,000 a year. They parted company acrimoniously when Fayed became exasperated at Rees-Jones's inability to remember details of the crash. Fayed has since accused him of failing to do his job properly. \u0095 Email John Arlidge at john.arlidge@observer.co.uk",

Instead, the LVF warned this weekend that it was prepared to extend its war with the UVF into the rivals' heartland, Belfast's Shankill Road. Sources close to the LVF leadership in Portadown told The Observer it was 'not backing down' from confrontation, and there would be no peace talks between the groups. 'The LVF have had enough - there will be no more bully-boy tactics. Retaliation will not be against an innocent UVF man. Targets will be correctly selected and dealt with.' In a direct threat to the UVF's leadership, the LVF source said blame for the recent deaths of teenagers Andrew Robb and David Mcllwaine 'lies at the door of the Eagle' - the UVF's Shankill Road headquarters. The UVF, however, has denied that its leaders sanctioned the torture and killing of the teenagers in Tandragree a fortnight ago. Three people have died in the inter-loyalist conflict, including Portadown businessman Richard Jameson. Security sources say he was the leader of the UVF in Mid-Ulster but the murdered man's family denies this. The LVF source alleged that the Jameson killing was not sanctioned by his organisation. If the LVF carries out its threat to strike at the UVF leaders, this will mark a major escalation of the feud which has simmered since the LVF was formed following a split in the UVF's Mid-Ulster brigade in 1996. Although the LVF is strong in Portadown, its rival commands the loyalty of hundreds of experienced and ruthless paramilitaries in Greater Belfast. The only way the LVF could operate there would be with the covert co-operation of the other loyalist terror group, the Ulster Defence Association.

He was at the cutting edge of an industry hailed as the answer to the energy problems of the human race: nuclear power.</p> <p>He had a young wife and a baby daughter. His new job meant he could afford a semi-detached home six miles from the Preston laboratory where he worked. Their future secure, Joe and Stella hoped to expand their family.</p> <p>Then in 1953 an accident happened which they now believe determined their dreadful fate for the next three decades - Joe was exposed to uranium.</p> <p>He was called to see his boss, who told him the radiation in his body was 28 times above normal but that there was little to worry about. Joe did not tell Stella about the accident since he had signed the Official Secrets Act.</p> <p>But it was not his own health that proved to be at risk. He is convinced that the exposure he underwent is why he has had to bury three of his four children in 24 years. Two died of rare leu-kaemia-related illnesses; one baby girl died of lung problems. Sharon, the only surviving daughter, lives from day to day thinking she will be next.</p> <p>Joe has been told by doctors that he has a chromosome abnormality, a rare deficiency linked to radiation exposure. He believes he passed the disease on to his children through his sperm.</p> <p>Joe told The Observer : 'I blame myself. How could I not? I get off to sleep and then I'll be awake again. I end up listening to the radio all night.</p> <p>'Something that always sticks with me is a man I heard on the television. It was the father of that girl Leah Betts, who died from Ecstasy. He said he mourned the grandchildren he'd missed out on. I know that feeling.'</p> <p>The McMasters have been quietly campaigning against British Nuclear Fuels, the company that owned the laboratory, for the last 10 years. They do not want any money; all they seek is an acknowledgement that the cancer found in their children was caused by radiation.</p> <p>They are backed by radioactivity research pioneer Dr Alice Stewart and by their MP, Tory Party vice-chairman Nigel Evans, who hopes to refer their case to the Department of Trade and Industry Select Committee.</p> <p>The couple's first child, Lynn, died in 1987, aged 37, of a rare leukaemia-related blood disorder. She needed a bone marrow transplant and Joe learnt that he was a match. But his chromosome defect meant that he could not be a donor. No other donor could be found. Baby Jill arrived in 1955, born with an immune system deficiency. She trained to be a nurse but died, aged just 18, in 1973, of an unknown form of acute leukaemia.</p> <p>In 1958 they had twin daughters. Sharon weighed 4lb 9oz and her stronger sister, Judith, 5lb 8oz. Three days after the birth, Judith died of lung failure.</p> <p>'I wanted four children,' said Stella. 'I have one left and she's on a knife edge. Sharon just lives from day to day thinking she is next.</p> <p>'In all those years Joe never told me what had happened. I suspected something, but after Lynn's doctors asked if she worked with radiation I sat him down and asked him straight out.'</p> <p>Science is divided on whether they are either a tragically unlucky family or the victims of a gross injustice. Dr Richard Wakefield, BNFL's principal research scientist, said: 'I have met with the McMasters and it is all very sad, but it is scientifically difficult to see links between this tragic occurrence and Joe's work at Springfield. We have looked at this very hard indeed.'</p> <p>He believes Joe's chromosome abnormality is due to ageing and pointed out that Lynn was born before he started at Springfield.</p> <p>Dr Brian Lord, of the Paterson Institute in Manchester, said: 'No one can ever prove an individual cancer is related to radiation. There are several theories and no consensus. My research shows radiation could increase sensitivity to leukaemia, but BNFL don't want to hear that.'</p> <p>A 1992 compensation case brought by families claiming a leukaemia cluster around Sellafield failed. The families' lawyer, Martyn Day, was angry that BNFL, 'in an unprecedented step', wrote to the legal aid board asking for families' claims to be denied.</p> <p>He told The Observer : 'There was strong evidence on both sides, but I was disappointed in the result. It will be a long, long time before anyone would take BNFL to court again.'</p> <p>BNFL was last month embroiled in safety scandals which led to the sacking of chief executive John Taylor. Safety at Sellafield was described as 'only just tolerable' by inspectors.</p> <p>The McMasters just want justice. 'The day before Lynn died, we were in the hospital,' said Stella. 'She [Lynn] said to me: \"It's not my dad's fault, don't blame my dad\". She knew what was to blame and I won't rest until I prove it.'</p> <p>\u0095 Email Tracy McVeigh at <a href=\"mailto:tracy.mcveigh@observer.co.uk\">tracy.mcveigh@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

He was at the cutting edge of an industry hailed as the answer to the energy problems of the human race: nuclear power. He had a young wife and a baby daughter. His new job meant he could afford a semi-detached home six miles from the Preston laboratory where he worked. Their future secure, Joe and Stella hoped to expand their family. Then in 1953 an accident happened which they now believe determined their dreadful fate for the next three decades - Joe was exposed to uranium. He was called to see his boss, who told him the radiation in his body was 28 times above normal but that there was little to worry about. Joe did not tell Stella about the accident since he had signed the Official Secrets Act. But it was not his own health that proved to be at risk. He is convinced that the exposure he underwent is why he has had to bury three of his four children in 24 years. Two died of rare leu-kaemia-related illnesses; one baby girl died of lung problems. Sharon, the only surviving daughter, lives from day to day thinking she will be next. Joe has been told by doctors that he has a chromosome abnormality, a rare deficiency linked to radiation exposure. He believes he passed the disease on to his children through his sperm. Joe told The Observer : 'I blame myself. How could I not? I get off to sleep and then I'll be awake again. I end up listening to the radio all night. 'Something that always sticks with me is a man I heard on the television. It was the father of that girl Leah Betts, who died from Ecstasy. He said he mourned the grandchildren he'd missed out on. I know that feeling.' The McMasters have been quietly campaigning against British Nuclear Fuels, the company that owned the laboratory, for the last 10 years. They do not want any money; all they seek is an acknowledgement that the cancer found in their children was caused by radiation. They are backed by radioactivity research pioneer Dr Alice Stewart and by their MP, Tory Party vice-chairman Nigel Evans, who hopes to refer their case to the Department of Trade and Industry Select Committee. The couple's first child, Lynn, died in 1987, aged 37, of a rare leukaemia-related blood disorder. She needed a bone marrow transplant and Joe learnt that he was a match. But his chromosome defect meant that he could not be a donor. No other donor could be found. Baby Jill arrived in 1955, born with an immune system deficiency. She trained to be a nurse but died, aged just 18, in 1973, of an unknown form of acute leukaemia. In 1958 they had twin daughters. Sharon weighed 4lb 9oz and her stronger sister, Judith, 5lb 8oz. Three days after the birth, Judith died of lung failure. 'I wanted four children,' said Stella. 'I have one left and she's on a knife edge. Sharon just lives from day to day thinking she is next. 'In all those years Joe never told me what had happened. I suspected something, but after Lynn's doctors asked if she worked with radiation I sat him down and asked him straight out.' Science is divided on whether they are either a tragically unlucky family or the victims of a gross injustice. Dr Richard Wakefield, BNFL's principal research scientist, said: 'I have met with the McMasters and it is all very sad, but it is scientifically difficult to see links between this tragic occurrence and Joe's work at Springfield. We have looked at this very hard indeed.' He believes Joe's chromosome abnormality is due to ageing and pointed out that Lynn was born before he started at Springfield. Dr Brian Lord, of the Paterson Institute in Manchester, said: 'No one can ever prove an individual cancer is related to radiation. There are several theories and no consensus. My research shows radiation could increase sensitivity to leukaemia, but BNFL don't want to hear that.' A 1992 compensation case brought by families claiming a leukaemia cluster around Sellafield failed. The families' lawyer, Martyn Day, was angry that BNFL, 'in an unprecedented step', wrote to the legal aid board asking for families' claims to be denied. He told The Observer : 'There was strong evidence on both sides, but I was disappointed in the result. It will be a long, long time before anyone would take BNFL to court again.' BNFL was last month embroiled in safety scandals which led to the sacking of chief executive John Taylor. Safety at Sellafield was described as 'only just tolerable' by inspectors. The McMasters just want justice. 'The day before Lynn died, we were in the hospital,' said Stella. 'She [Lynn] said to me: \"It's not my dad's fault, don't blame my dad\". She knew what was to blame and I won't rest until I prove it.' \u0095 Email Tracy McVeigh at tracy.mcveigh@observer.co.uk",

      "byline": "Alex Bell, Scotland Correspondent",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Convicted killers could get \u00a31,000 in compensation from the Scottish Executive because Scots law on bail proceedings breaks the European Convention on Human Rights.</p> <p>The Observer' s revelation adds to a list of legal hiccups which have brought into question civil servants' state of readiness for the introduction of the convention into Scottish law.</p> <p>The Executive plans to change the law within two months to remove the anomaly over bail for murderers, but any case before that date could be open to challenge. Last week the European Court of Human Rights awarded \u00a31,000 to a man convicted of manslaughter because he had been denied his basic rights when applying for bail.</p> <p>The problem is simple. Article 5, paragraph three, of the convention states that the first judge a person accused of a killing sees must have the power to grant bail. That is impossible under Scots law. An accused will first see a sheriff, who has no powers to grant bail in cases of murder. The accused must apply for bail by making a specific plea to the High Court after seeing the sheriff.</p> <p>Clive Caballero had already been convicted of manslaughter when he faced new charges of rape. His solicitor didn't apply for bail as, under English law, bail cannot be granted to a defendant with a previous serious conviction. He was subsequently convicted of the rape.</p> <p>Caballero argued that being refused the option of bail was a violation of the European Convention. The European Court of Human Rights found unanimously in his favour and awarded him \u00a31,000 in damages and \u00a315,250 costs and expenses, less the amount received in legal aid from the Council of Europe.</p> <p>Legal experts say the same could occur in Scotland. Though the law is different on the point of bail between the two countries, they both automatically deny bail in certain categories of crime. 'There is no doubt Scots law falls foul of the European Convention on this point,' said Professor Allan Miller of Strathclyde University.</p> <p>Tory leader David McLetchie raised the issue in Holyrood during Thursday's debate on the impact of the convention on Scots law. 'Some believe that the current situation with regard to bail for murder is in breach of ECHR; because a sheriff does not have the power to authorise bail in such cases, it could be argued that bringing someone before a court without the necessary power to authorise their release on bail infringes their rights under Article 5 of the convention.'</p> <p>His suspicion was right. Justice Minister Jim Wallace admitted as much in his response, but only said the executive was monitoring the impact of the Caballero case. 'We have taken note of the recent judgment in the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Caballero v United Kingdom and will consider our response to that. If that requires legislation, I will bring proposals to the Parliament.

      "bodyText": "Convicted killers could get \u00a31,000 in compensation from the Scottish Executive because Scots law on bail proceedings breaks the European Convention on Human Rights. The Observer' s revelation adds to a list of legal hiccups which have brought into question civil servants' state of readiness for the introduction of the convention into Scottish law. The Executive plans to change the law within two months to remove the anomaly over bail for murderers, but any case before that date could be open to challenge. Last week the European Court of Human Rights awarded \u00a31,000 to a man convicted of manslaughter because he had been denied his basic rights when applying for bail. The problem is simple. Article 5, paragraph three, of the convention states that the first judge a person accused of a killing sees must have the power to grant bail. That is impossible under Scots law. An accused will first see a sheriff, who has no powers to grant bail in cases of murder. The accused must apply for bail by making a specific plea to the High Court after seeing the sheriff. Clive Caballero had already been convicted of manslaughter when he faced new charges of rape. His solicitor didn't apply for bail as, under English law, bail cannot be granted to a defendant with a previous serious conviction. He was subsequently convicted of the rape. Caballero argued that being refused the option of bail was a violation of the European Convention. The European Court of Human Rights found unanimously in his favour and awarded him \u00a31,000 in damages and \u00a315,250 costs and expenses, less the amount received in legal aid from the Council of Europe. Legal experts say the same could occur in Scotland. Though the law is different on the point of bail between the two countries, they both automatically deny bail in certain categories of crime. 'There is no doubt Scots law falls foul of the European Convention on this point,' said Professor Allan Miller of Strathclyde University. Tory leader David McLetchie raised the issue in Holyrood during Thursday's debate on the impact of the convention on Scots law. 'Some believe that the current situation with regard to bail for murder is in breach of ECHR; because a sheriff does not have the power to authorise bail in such cases, it could be argued that bringing someone before a court without the necessary power to authorise their release on bail infringes their rights under Article 5 of the convention.' His suspicion was right. Justice Minister Jim Wallace admitted as much in his response, but only said the executive was monitoring the impact of the Caballero case. 'We have taken note of the recent judgment in the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Caballero v United Kingdom and will consider our response to that. If that requires legislation, I will bring proposals to the Parliament. We are trying both to anticipate and to react.' The law regarding bail is just the latest in a string of cases where the introduction of the ECHR will alter Scots law. The use of temporary sheriffs was found illegal last year and recently Section 172 of the Traffic Act was deemed at fault under the European Convention. As The Observer exclusively reported a month ago, the Scottish Executive is conducting an audit of Scots law and governmental practice to see what else needs to be changed under the ECHR. It is expected that the treatment of children in the legal system and legal aid arrangements will also have to be altered. The audit must be completed within months as the entire statute book must be compatible with the convention by October, when it is incorporated into UK law.",

Other astronomers still argue that life is common in the universe. However no one can be sure. Only a call from ET - and another disturbed night for Ian Morison - could answer that question. Sixty years of false encounters 1938 Radio version of H.G. Wells's War of the Worlds is produced in the United States by a cast led by Orson Welles. Broadcast leads to widespread panic as listeners believe 'news' of the invading Martians is real. 1947 Roswell, New Mexico. Locals discover pieces of aircraft wreckage and claim it was a spaceship. The story acquires legendary status and is now the basis of a TV series. In fact, the crash involved a weather balloon. 1967 Radio waves discovered that beat with such rapid, regular precision, astronomers initially believe they are listening to 'little green men'. In fact the scientists had discovered pulsars, super-dense stars that emit radiation with clocklike accuracy. 1999 News report about signal detected from star HD 119850 triggers flurry of Internet conspiracy claims that intelligent aliens have been discovered. The signal is actually that of a communications satellite. \u0095 Email Robin Mckie at robin.mckie@observer.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "The Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, insisted yesterday that the main terrorist groups were maintaining their ceasefires despite warnings from the British Home Office that paramilitaries were gearing up to go back to war. Speaking before the Fianna Fail Ard Fheis in Dublin, Ahern said the groups threatening the peace process were few in number. 'There is no knowledge and no intelligence or information from main paramilitary groups on ceasefire. It has been well known for a long time that the security forces north and south of the border and in Britain have been very concerned about groups of dissidents,' he said. Ahern described the Home Office warnings as 'very worrying'. The Irish Prime Minister used the Ard Fheis to repeat his demand that the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant be shut down. Describing the plant as a threat to Ireland, Ahern told 5,000 delegates: 'We will not flinch from our objective. The closure of Sellafield remains a priority for this government.'Meanwhile Seamus Mallon, the SDLP deputy leader, accused Peter Mandel son yesterday of being absent without leave while the peace process faltered. Mallon criticised the Northern Ireland Secretary for attending a conflict resolution conference in Israel at a time when the British and Irish governments should be trying to rescue the Northern Ireland peace process. The Newry and Armagh MP also hit out at Dublin for spending more time at the conference in Tel Aviv than on the political deadlock closer to home. 'Conflict resolution at a conference in Israel while we have the problem sitting on our own doorstep doesn't seem to be the most urgent way of going about dealing with it,' Mallon said. He contrasted the two governments' lack of action with the mood building since the suspension of the power-sharing executive last month. 'Look at the gable ends of walls in hardline republican and loyalist areas - you see the change in tone in the graffiti,' he said. The comments by the former Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland come after a Home Office report, compiled before the renewal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act, claimed recent arms and explosives seizures indicated that terror groups were gearing up for war. Jeffrey Donaldson, the Ulster Unionist MP for Lagan Valley, demanded yesterday that the Home Office state explicitly which groups were preparing to resume violence. The Irish government's view of the current impasse is that the parties should be allowed a period of reflection before re-entering new negotiations after St Patrick's Day celebrations in Washington, at which several of the leading players will meet President Clinton. Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein President, said he saw little chance of a breakthrough in the peace process in the near future.",

This caveat aside, she speculates on what life might be like in an orthodox family unit with a hint of condescension. 'I mean, go to school, go home, just do whatever you do and it's the same every day.'</p> <p>Rosie's remarks suggest she has been spared the worst pain we expect children to endure as the result of family breakdown. They also indicate that her contentment may be linked to the unusual arrangements her parents have made for her care. Because although her mother and father no longer live together, she continues to live with both of them, half her time with one, the other half with the other, swapping between them during the week. For some, this may seem intolerable, not least for the child. But for Rosie two homes - and two parents - clearly seem so much better than one.</p> <p>This post-separation arrangement is known as 'co-parenting' and appears to be on the rise, especially among the liberal middle-classes. For co-parenting to work in practical terms generally requires that the two homes are within easy travelling distance of each other and the children's schools. It also requires both parents to be in a financial position to provide the comforts a child expects in a family home which, given the prevalence of households dependent on dual incomes and the often ruinous financial implications of separation, may not be easy.</p> <p>But the great potential of co-parenting is that neither parent automatically loses their children, and, most importantly, their children don't automatically lose either of them.</p> <p>Next week, the findings of research conducted by Carol Smart, Amanda Wade and Bren Neale at the Centre for Research on Family, Kinship and Childhood at the University of Leeds, are published. Focusing on the experience of 65 co-parented children, the results are revealing, not only of the pros and cons of co-parenting in particular, but also in confirming the often remarkable insights of children affected by separation or divorce into their own situations and those of their parents.</p> <p>The children interviewed for the project ranged in age from four to 17. Although all split their time 50:50 (or sometimes nearer 60:40) between their estranged parents, there were important variations. In some cases, one or both parents had found new partners, meaning that the children had become part of stepfamilies which could include stepsiblings, too. Sometimes, relations between the blood parents were cordial or friendly; sometimes not. Sometimes, the children, like Rosie, felt deeply cherished by their mother and father alike. Others had contrasting feelings about each, and some felt still caught in the crossfire.</p> <p>Even so, some unifying themes emerged. Most of the children felt it important to have both their parents involved in their lives, and those who had been moving between two different households from an early age regarded it as perfectly routine. Children also identified certain pretty basic advantages arising from their circumstances. Double birthday treats, for instance! Double holidays! Double toys!</p> <p>Inevitably, there were drawbacks. The more prosaic centred on the simple inconvenience arising from frequent moving back and forth. As the Leeds researchers put it: 'Many of the children spoke of how they kept forgetting where their books were or how they needed to pop back to the other house to fetch something.' This was obviously more of a problem for those whose parents' houses were some distance apart.</p> <p>But geography was not the only complicating factor. A greater one arose with parents who set down rigid rules against the transfer of belongings between the two homes, especially if one household provided particularly desirable items which the other did not. However, it was much more likely that the children would have problems simply because the general treatment in one home compared poorly with that in the other. This could be a result of individual parents' attitudes or relatively banal domestic matters. For example, some of the children complained that their fathers were poor homemakers. One girl reported particular discomfort with the state of the lavatory at her father's place.</p> <p>Co-parenting, then, can clearly bring pluses and minuses for children, but if there is a single factor marking success from failure, it is probably the degree of continuing, conspicuous ill-feeling between Mum and Dad - inevitable though that sometimes is. A previous research project among adolescent children in the United States found that, in general, children who maintained close ties with both parents fared better than those who didn't. However, it also discovered that a majority of adolescents living in two homes (in this case not necessarily for equal amounts of time) reported experiencing 'loyalty conflicts' as a result. Co-parenting ex-partners need to be mindful of these.</p> <p>The new work from the Leeds team is especially fascinating for its insights into co-parented children's capacity for 'moral reasoning' about their circumstances. There is a wealth of testimony to even quite young children's wishes to be fair to both their parents, to care for their needs and to have their own needs and wishes properly respected. These themes emerged time and time again, demonstrating that, far from being passive objects of concern, the children were equipped to make significant contributions to discussions about their dual-family set-ups.</p> <p>Other research shows that such capacities are not limited to co-parented, mostly middle-class children like these. It is, nonetheless, impressive to see their sophisticated grasps of the difficult dilemmas they sometimes faced, such as the fact that a parent who only sees you half the time might like it if you weren't always off out with your mates. The children also had good ideas concerning practical arrangements.</p> <p>For example, many found the transition from one household to another far easier if a school day provided a buffer period than if changeovers took place at weekends. Co-parenting remains a suitable case for further research.

      "body": "<p>If bricks and mortar can heal, the dedication of a building in Waterloo this month could end one of the great personal quarrels in the history of science. The Franklin-Wilkins building of King's College London, to be opened by the Princess Royal on 22 March, will couple the names of two pivotal scientific figures who were bitter enemies during the two years they worked together: Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins Kings' intention is obviously to remind the world how much it contributed, through their work, to the discovery of the double helix of DNA in the spring of 1953. But irony will hang heavy over the occasion. King's was scooped to the discovery by James Watson and Francis Crick at the rival Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. And the celebratory address will be given by Watson and Wilkins, the men most responsible for casting Franklin as the 'dark lady' of DNA.</p> <p>The event will also be overshadowed by the college's own unease over Franklin's unhappy experience there. 'No longer the \"forgotten scientist\" of the DNA story', the King's alumni magazine proclaimed this autumn, with a picture of Franklin on the cover. Inside, it rehearsed the facts: Wilkins won the Nobel Prize in 1962 with Watson and Crick. Franklin died before the prize was awarded. (Nobel Prizes are never given posthumously.)</p> <p>The college now knows the part it played in creating the tension between Wilkins and Franklin. In 1950, the head of its biophysics unit, Professor John T. Randall, invited Franklin, working in Paris where she had acquired a fine reputation in X-ray crystallography, to apply her skills at King's. After she accepted, he changed his mind about what she should work on and directed her to working on fibres of DNA. She would have the project to herself, he told her, apart from a research student, Raymond Gosling, and an American temporary assistant. He did not tell her that Wilkins had already done formidable work on DNA and intended to continue. Wilkins was away at the time and never knew the terms of appoint ment. He believed Franklin was coming to join his team.</p> <p>The stage - the dingy basement laboratories beneath King's College in the Strand - was thus set for trouble, even before the clash of temperaments that became apparent once Franklin heard Wilkins daring to voice his opinions on her results. On the one side was a quick, single-minded young woman with a passion for argument; on the other an exceedingly reserved man with a hesitant, circumlocutory manner and an aversion to direct eye contact.</p> <p>Wilkins was aware that in Cambridge Watson and Crick at the Cavendish were barging in on King's territory by working on DNA, but intermittently and through using the entirely different route of model-building rather than taking X-ray photographs. On many visits to Cambridge he spoke freely to them of his troubles with Franklin who, he felt, had virtually shut him out of his own subject.</p> <p>Franklin, on arriving at King's, realised she had made a terrible mistake. She loathed what she felt was the cold atmosphere of King's, where women were not allowed in the senior common room. As soon as she could organise the transfer of her Turner-Newall fellowship to another University of London college, Birkbeck, she announced she was leaving. Wilkins was delighted. Franklin, he felt, had been given the best cameras and DNA samples to work with, only to try to keep her results to herself rather than sharing them in the spirit of scientific collegiality.</p> <p>As 1953 opened, Franklin wrote to a friend that she was leaving much work undone in order to get out of King's as soon as possible. At the end of January, when Watson visited King's, Wilkins showed him the best of her photographs. Numbered 51, it showed the B-form of DNA, with a stark, black cross of reflections. One look told Watson, a brash and ambitious 25-year-old from the American Midwest, that he and Crick were on the right track.</p> <p>He returned to Cambridge and, with Crick, started to construct a model with double coils of paired atoms. Knowing that further experimental data from the work of Franklin and others at King's was in a report circulated among members of the biophysics committee of the Medical Research Council, source of the money for Randall's research unit, they asked Max Perutz, a Cavendish colleague, to let them see it. He obliged. On 7 March, a happy Wilkins wrote to Crick: 'I think you will be interested to know that our dark lady leaves us next week ... at last the decks are clear and we can put all hands to the pumps! It won't be long now. M.'</p> <p>But it was too late. By the time Wilkins's letter reached Cambridge, the pair whose names will be forever linked had completed their model and were drafting for the scientific journal Nature the now-celebrated letter announcing in effect that they had discovered the secret of life. Published on 25 April 1953, it ended with the famous understatement: 'It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.'</p> <p>It did escape Franklin's notice, however, that before completing their model, Watson had had the advantage of seeing her stunning Photograph 51 and of reading her precise calculations on the molecule's dimensions.</p> <p>News that the Cavendish had scooped them caused much consternation at King's. There was some feeling that Wilkins had gone up to Cambridge too often, talked too freely, been milked for data by the clever Cavendish pair and given away what belonged to the home team. What has never been disputed are the brilliant perceptions - how the chains were linked by complementary pairs of base pairs and how they ran in opposite directions - that vaulted Watson and Crick to the summit.</p> <p>Through some complicated old-boy networking between Randall, Sir Lawrence Bragg at the Cavendish and the editor of Nature , King's was allowed to announce its own progress on DNA in the same issue. There were to be, appropriately enough, considering the circumstances, two separate papers from King's: one from Wilkins and his colleagues, A.R. Stokes and H.R. Wilson, a second by Franklin and Gosling. This enabled her to put Photograph 51 into print at last.</p> <p>A week before these publications, Franklin, now happily at Birkbeck, received more unpleasantness from King's. Randall wrote to say that she was to stop working, even to stop thinking, about 'the nucleic acid problem'. Furthermore, she was to cease supervising Gosling on his thesis. The reorganisation made necessary by her departure could not proceed 'while you remain, in an intellectual sense, a member of the laboratory'.</p> <p>Franklin laughed off the dictatorial letter, saying: 'Just the sort of thing they do there [ie, at King's].' She and the young, genial Gosling, who were jointly working on several unfinished publications, had great fun meeting as if subversives. Moreover, she reasoned that she could hardly stop thinking about the nucleic acids, for a form was present in the tobacco mosaic virus, the subject of her new research. (She was to achieve impressive results on TMV before her death.)</p> <p>Franklin's first step toward wider public recognition came only in 1968, and to many it was a backward step. The mythologising of Rosalind Franklin, and probably of DNA itself, began with the publication of The Double Helix , Watson's brilliant, entertaining, tactless bestseller. In it 'Rosy' Franklin appears as the villainess, the archetypal bluestocking, a harpy who might have been pretty if she had only bothered to take off her glasses and do something interesting with her hair.</p> <p>'Clearly,' wrote Watson about Wilkins's dilemma, 'Rosy had to go or be put in her place _ unfortunately, Maurice could not see any decent way to give Rosy the boot.'</p> <p>Chauvinist words like these were sufficient to launch the legend of Franklin, the wronged heroine. Since then the myth has grown and, abetted by the fact of her tragic early death from ovarian cancer at the age of 37, shows no signs of fading. Franklin has become a feminist icon, the Sylvia Plath of molecular biology, a genius whose gifts were sacrificed to the greater glory of the male. Her failure to win the Nobel Prize has been seen as the prime example of the entrenched misogyny of the science establishment, rather than the consequence of the Nobel policy against posthumous awards.</p> <p>One aggrieved American neuroscientist, Candace Pert, blamed anti-female prejudice when she was passed over for an award she felt she deserved. It was just what had happened to Franklin, she argued. In her 1997 book, Molecules of Emotion , Pert goes so far as to suggest that Franklin's cancer 'had been exacerbated by the humiliation she suffered at the hands of these, and probably many other, old boys'.</p> <p>A more substantial boost to Franklin's posthumous reputation was given by Sir Aaron Klug, now president of the Royal Society, who was Franklin's closest collaborator at Birk- beck. From studying her DNA lab books he has revealed that in March 1953 she was far closer to solving the structure of DNA than her contemporaries realised. Moreover, he spelled out her crucial contributions: establishing DNA's existence in two forms, A and B; working out the position of the phosphorous atoms in the molecule's backbone and, critically, taking the clearest photographs of its internal structure.</p> <p>To him, her weakness was isolation: 'She needed a collaborator and she didn't have one - somebody to break the pattern of her thinking, to show what was right in front of her, to push her up and over.'</p> <p>Signs of belated recognition proliferate. Franklin was accorded a highly sympathetic portrayal in the BBC Horizon programme's 1987 dramatisation, Life Story . The National Portrait Gallery placed her photograph beside that of Wilkins and beneath those of Watson and Crick in its science room. Her Cambridge college, Newnham, dedicated a graduate building to her. Her London school, St Paul's Girls', now has a Rosalind Franklin design technology engineering workshop.</p> <p>Perhaps it is now Wilkins whose image needs burnishing. Outside of King's, where he is revered, he has suffered unfairly from his caricature in what he calls 'Jim's novel'. Over the years, he has been hounded by the charge that he holds a prize that rightfully belongs to someone else and that he was wrong to show Franklin's photograph to Watson. In fact, he held the photograph quite properly, as Franklin was turning over to him her materials preparatory to leaving King's. More hurtful has been being accused of being anti-female, which his colleagues and students know he is not. He has even suggested that the more fitting name for the new building would be the Hanson-Franklin-Wilkins building, in honour also of Dr Jean Hanson, his distinguished colleague at King's for many years.</p> <p>Easily glossed over in the much-retold story is the substantial work that had already been done there on DNA fibres before Franklin's arrival. Because of it, she was able to pick up a new subject and race ahead with it. The college's pioneering work may be more appreciated when the full record of the events leading to the discovery can be read. Such an archive for the history of molecular biology is now being assembled by the Norman Publishing Company in San Francisco. Its representative, who will be on hand at the King's proceedings on 22 March, is Al Seckel, a cognitive neuroscientist from the California Institute of Technology. Seckel has already acquired papers, correspon dence and lab notebooks of many eminent scientists, including Franklin, Crick, Klug, Gosling and Max Perutz, and is keen for more.</p> <p>The dedication of the Franklin-Wilkins building will bring together all the surviving principals of the race for DNA, except for Crick, who will appear on video from his home in California. There is, however, apprehension about what Watson will say. Now president of the Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory on Long Island and former director of the US human genome project, he is not only a candid author but an unpredictable speaker, with a penchant for making headlines with unguarded remarks. At the launch in September of the Harvard Center for Genomics Research, he opened his inaugural address before an overflow crowd of 1,000 students and faculty with a ingenuous denial of guilt: 'There's a myth which is that, you know, that Francis and I basically stole the structure from the people at King's. I was shown Rosalind Franklin's X-ray photograph and \"Whooo! That was a helix!\", and a month later, we had the structure; and [that] Wilkins should never have shown me the thing. I didn't go into the drawer and steal it. It was shown to me, and I was told the dimensions, a repeat of 34 angstroms, so, you know, I knew roughly what it meant and it was that the Franklin photograph was the key event _ psychologically, it mobilised us back into action.</p> <p>'The truth is that we should have got the structure in the fall of '51.

      "bodyText": "If bricks and mortar can heal, the dedication of a building in Waterloo this month could end one of the great personal quarrels in the history of science. The Franklin-Wilkins building of King's College London, to be opened by the Princess Royal on 22 March, will couple the names of two pivotal scientific figures who were bitter enemies during the two years they worked together: Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins Kings' intention is obviously to remind the world how much it contributed, through their work, to the discovery of the double helix of DNA in the spring of 1953. But irony will hang heavy over the occasion. King's was scooped to the discovery by James Watson and Francis Crick at the rival Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge. And the celebratory address will be given by Watson and Wilkins, the men most responsible for casting Franklin as the 'dark lady' of DNA. The event will also be overshadowed by the college's own unease over Franklin's unhappy experience there. 'No longer the \"forgotten scientist\" of the DNA story', the King's alumni magazine proclaimed this autumn, with a picture of Franklin on the cover. Inside, it rehearsed the facts: Wilkins won the Nobel Prize in 1962 with Watson and Crick. Franklin died before the prize was awarded. (Nobel Prizes are never given posthumously.) The college now knows the part it played in creating the tension between Wilkins and Franklin. In 1950, the head of its biophysics unit, Professor John T. Randall, invited Franklin, working in Paris where she had acquired a fine reputation in X-ray crystallography, to apply her skills at King's. After she accepted, he changed his mind about what she should work on and directed her to working on fibres of DNA. She would have the project to herself, he told her, apart from a research student, Raymond Gosling, and an American temporary assistant. He did not tell her that Wilkins had already done formidable work on DNA and intended to continue. Wilkins was away at the time and never knew the terms of appoint ment. He believed Franklin was coming to join his team. The stage - the dingy basement laboratories beneath King's College in the Strand - was thus set for trouble, even before the clash of temperaments that became apparent once Franklin heard Wilkins daring to voice his opinions on her results. On the one side was a quick, single-minded young woman with a passion for argument; on the other an exceedingly reserved man with a hesitant, circumlocutory manner and an aversion to direct eye contact. Wilkins was aware that in Cambridge Watson and Crick at the Cavendish were barging in on King's territory by working on DNA, but intermittently and through using the entirely different route of model-building rather than taking X-ray photographs. On many visits to Cambridge he spoke freely to them of his troubles with Franklin who, he felt, had virtually shut him out of his own subject. Franklin, on arriving at King's, realised she had made a terrible mistake. She loathed what she felt was the cold atmosphere of King's, where women were not allowed in the senior common room. As soon as she could organise the transfer of her Turner-Newall fellowship to another University of London college, Birkbeck, she announced she was leaving. Wilkins was delighted. Franklin, he felt, had been given the best cameras and DNA samples to work with, only to try to keep her results to herself rather than sharing them in the spirit of scientific collegiality. As 1953 opened, Franklin wrote to a friend that she was leaving much work undone in order to get out of King's as soon as possible. At the end of January, when Watson visited King's, Wilkins showed him the best of her photographs. Numbered 51, it showed the B-form of DNA, with a stark, black cross of reflections. One look told Watson, a brash and ambitious 25-year-old from the American Midwest, that he and Crick were on the right track. He returned to Cambridge and, with Crick, started to construct a model with double coils of paired atoms. Knowing that further experimental data from the work of Franklin and others at King's was in a report circulated among members of the biophysics committee of the Medical Research Council, source of the money for Randall's research unit, they asked Max Perutz, a Cavendish colleague, to let them see it. He obliged. On 7 March, a happy Wilkins wrote to Crick: 'I think you will be interested to know that our dark lady leaves us next week ... at last the decks are clear and we can put all hands to the pumps! It won't be long now. M.' But it was too late. By the time Wilkins's letter reached Cambridge, the pair whose names will be forever linked had completed their model and were drafting for the scientific journal Nature the now-celebrated letter announcing in effect that they had discovered the secret of life. Published on 25 April 1953, it ended with the famous understatement: 'It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.' It did escape Franklin's notice, however, that before completing their model, Watson had had the advantage of seeing her stunning Photograph 51 and of reading her precise calculations on the molecule's dimensions. News that the Cavendish had scooped them caused much consternation at King's. There was some feeling that Wilkins had gone up to Cambridge too often, talked too freely, been milked for data by the clever Cavendish pair and given away what belonged to the home team. What has never been disputed are the brilliant perceptions - how the chains were linked by complementary pairs of base pairs and how they ran in opposite directions - that vaulted Watson and Crick to the summit. Through some complicated old-boy networking between Randall, Sir Lawrence Bragg at the Cavendish and the editor of Nature , King's was allowed to announce its own progress on DNA in the same issue. There were to be, appropriately enough, considering the circumstances, two separate papers from King's: one from Wilkins and his colleagues, A.R. Stokes and H.R. Wilson, a second by Franklin and Gosling. This enabled her to put Photograph 51 into print at last. A week before these publications, Franklin, now happily at Birkbeck, received more unpleasantness from King's. Randall wrote to say that she was to stop working, even to stop thinking, about 'the nucleic acid problem'. Furthermore, she was to cease supervising Gosling on his thesis. The reorganisation made necessary by her departure could not proceed 'while you remain, in an intellectual sense, a member of the laboratory'. Franklin laughed off the dictatorial letter, saying: 'Just the sort of thing they do there [ie, at King's].' She and the young, genial Gosling, who were jointly working on several unfinished publications, had great fun meeting as if subversives. Moreover, she reasoned that she could hardly stop thinking about the nucleic acids, for a form was present in the tobacco mosaic virus, the subject of her new research. (She was to achieve impressive results on TMV before her death.) Franklin's first step toward wider public recognition came only in 1968, and to many it was a backward step. The mythologising of Rosalind Franklin, and probably of DNA itself, began with the publication of The Double Helix , Watson's brilliant, entertaining, tactless bestseller. In it 'Rosy' Franklin appears as the villainess, the archetypal bluestocking, a harpy who might have been pretty if she had only bothered to take off her glasses and do something interesting with her hair. 'Clearly,' wrote Watson about Wilkins's dilemma, 'Rosy had to go or be put in her place _ unfortunately, Maurice could not see any decent way to give Rosy the boot.' Chauvinist words like these were sufficient to launch the legend of Franklin, the wronged heroine. Since then the myth has grown and, abetted by the fact of her tragic early death from ovarian cancer at the age of 37, shows no signs of fading. Franklin has become a feminist icon, the Sylvia Plath of molecular biology, a genius whose gifts were sacrificed to the greater glory of the male. Her failure to win the Nobel Prize has been seen as the prime example of the entrenched misogyny of the science establishment, rather than the consequence of the Nobel policy against posthumous awards. One aggrieved American neuroscientist, Candace Pert, blamed anti-female prejudice when she was passed over for an award she felt she deserved. It was just what had happened to Franklin, she argued. In her 1997 book, Molecules of Emotion , Pert goes so far as to suggest that Franklin's cancer 'had been exacerbated by the humiliation she suffered at the hands of these, and probably many other, old boys'. A more substantial boost to Franklin's posthumous reputation was given by Sir Aaron Klug, now president of the Royal Society, who was Franklin's closest collaborator at Birk- beck. From studying her DNA lab books he has revealed that in March 1953 she was far closer to solving the structure of DNA than her contemporaries realised. Moreover, he spelled out her crucial contributions: establishing DNA's existence in two forms, A and B; working out the position of the phosphorous atoms in the molecule's backbone and, critically, taking the clearest photographs of its internal structure. To him, her weakness was isolation: 'She needed a collaborator and she didn't have one - somebody to break the pattern of her thinking, to show what was right in front of her, to push her up and over.' Signs of belated recognition proliferate. Franklin was accorded a highly sympathetic portrayal in the BBC Horizon programme's 1987 dramatisation, Life Story . The National Portrait Gallery placed her photograph beside that of Wilkins and beneath those of Watson and Crick in its science room. Her Cambridge college, Newnham, dedicated a graduate building to her. Her London school, St Paul's Girls', now has a Rosalind Franklin design technology engineering workshop. Perhaps it is now Wilkins whose image needs burnishing. Outside of King's, where he is revered, he has suffered unfairly from his caricature in what he calls 'Jim's novel'. Over the years, he has been hounded by the charge that he holds a prize that rightfully belongs to someone else and that he was wrong to show Franklin's photograph to Watson. In fact, he held the photograph quite properly, as Franklin was turning over to him her materials preparatory to leaving King's. More hurtful has been being accused of being anti-female, which his colleagues and students know he is not. He has even suggested that the more fitting name for the new building would be the Hanson-Franklin-Wilkins building, in honour also of Dr Jean Hanson, his distinguished colleague at King's for many years. Easily glossed over in the much-retold story is the substantial work that had already been done there on DNA fibres before Franklin's arrival. Because of it, she was able to pick up a new subject and race ahead with it. The college's pioneering work may be more appreciated when the full record of the events leading to the discovery can be read. Such an archive for the history of molecular biology is now being assembled by the Norman Publishing Company in San Francisco. Its representative, who will be on hand at the King's proceedings on 22 March, is Al Seckel, a cognitive neuroscientist from the California Institute of Technology. Seckel has already acquired papers, correspon dence and lab notebooks of many eminent scientists, including Franklin, Crick, Klug, Gosling and Max Perutz, and is keen for more. The dedication of the Franklin-Wilkins building will bring together all the surviving principals of the race for DNA, except for Crick, who will appear on video from his home in California. There is, however, apprehension about what Watson will say. Now president of the Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory on Long Island and former director of the US human genome project, he is not only a candid author but an unpredictable speaker, with a penchant for making headlines with unguarded remarks. At the launch in September of the Harvard Center for Genomics Research, he opened his inaugural address before an overflow crowd of 1,000 students and faculty with a ingenuous denial of guilt: 'There's a myth which is that, you know, that Francis and I basically stole the structure from the people at King's. I was shown Rosalind Franklin's X-ray photograph and \"Whooo! That was a helix!\", and a month later, we had the structure; and [that] Wilkins should never have shown me the thing. I didn't go into the drawer and steal it. It was shown to me, and I was told the dimensions, a repeat of 34 angstroms, so, you know, I knew roughly what it meant and it was that the Franklin photograph was the key event _ psychologically, it mobilised us back into action. 'The truth is that we should have got the structure in the fall of '51. There was enough data. We wouldn't have been able to say with finality that it was right because, uh, that came with Rosalind's X-ray work, that was the proof it was right _ first slide. Oh, there _' And up on the screen went Franklin's Photograph 51. But why, we outsiders may ask, this intense surge of fascination for the personalities and lab politics of 1953? The answer, of course, is the growing popular awareness of the importance of DNA. This three-letter abbreviation for deoxyribonucleic acid, the molecule that lies in every gene, has entered the common vocabulary. It is in the tabloids every day. GM food, genetic engineering and all the rest are the consequence of the discovery that has edged out Einstein's relativity theory as the greatest of the twentieth century. The names of Watson and Crick have joined Darwin and Copernicus among the immortals. If the names of Franklin and Wilkins are not among them, they at least will share a building on the South Bank of the Thames. \u0095 Brenda Maddox is writing the biography of Rosalind Franklin for HarperCollins.",

      "body": "<b>Scottish Parliament estimate \u00a340m - Real cost \u00a3230m<p>Portcullis House estimate \u00a3165 - Real cost \u00a3250m</p></b> <p><b>Dome estimate \u00a3758m - Real cost \u00a31bn</b></p> <p>Eight months ago, Scotland's First Minister Donald Dewar put a figure of \u00a3109 million on the cost of the new Parliament that he is building in Edinburgh. Last week, the Scottish Executive admitted that the latest estimate was \u00a3230m. Given that back in 1997, when Enric Miralles, the Catalan architect responsible for the project was appointed, the building was costed at \u00a340m, it is hardly surprising that David Steel, the Parliament's Presiding Officer, should be worried enough to appoint his own assessor to probe the reasons for the apparent quadrupling of the costs. </p> <p>The Scottish press scented blood. They seized on the figures as yet another stick with which to beat Dewar, one that made a welcome change from their onslaught on his determination to repeal Section 28. And it produced, sotto voce , a lot of murmurings about the folly of entrusting such a symbolically charged project to an untested Spaniard with a comic-opera accent, an unpronounceable name and a design that he himself suggested was modelled on a couple of upturned boats sitting on a beach.The Parliament was instantly seized on as Dewar's Dome. </p> <p>But the problem with the Parliament building in Edinburgh is far from being a lack of ideas about its content. In fact, a lot of the extra costs have arisen because absolutely everybody had an idea of what the Parliament should be. Thus, in response to the original brief and its almost touching belief that a new Scotland would want to get away from the confrontational ways of bad old Westminster, Enric Miralles designed a gently curved, intimate debating chamber, rather than put members on opposing sets of benches two sword lengths apart. It was not as hostile as Westminster, nor as formal as a Continental-style amphitheatre chamber. </p> <p>But David Steel thought it looked like a banana and insisted on another fact-finding tour of European parliaments and a redesign. Judging by the vitriol that is flying around the Scottish Parliament in its temporary home in the Church of Scotland assembly building, it takes more than a seating plan to instil a spirit of brotherly love in Scottish MSPs. </p> <p>As with most high-profile cost overruns, it is clients changing their minds who push up figures rather than overweening architects. It was not Terry Farrell's design for the M16 ziggurat, for example, that allowed its costs to run off over the horizon; it was the 'refinements' that the spooks asked for after construction had started that made it so expensive. </p> <p>On part of the Edinburgh site stands a much mutilated but undoubtedly historic seventeenth-century house. It became a requirement that it should be restored and made part of the design of the new Parliament. But then it turned out to be so badly decayed that, as Miralles puts it, 'a gust of wind could blow it down'. More money had to be found to deal with it, rather than run the wrath of conservationists by demolishing it. </p> <p>And then, the MSPs started looking in detail at their offices. Not big enough, they concluded. It might also be added that Scotland's newspaper editors weren't much impressed by the size of the press gallery, either. And so the price grew and grew. And just like the Dome, which was originally adopted by Tony Blair from the nerveless grasp of the outgoing Major administration as a monumental celebration of the achievements of New Labour's first term, Dewar discovered that monument building is a double-edged political strategy. If it works, it creates the upbeat climate of a Barcelona or a Paris. If it doesn't, then the voters turn nasty. </p> <p>But even if the Dome has had a battering on its lack of a coherent strategy and purpose, it has managed to survive remarkably unscathed on the issue of price. Very early on, the Government took what looked to be a big risk. It announced a price so enormous, so colossal, that at \u00a3758m we have simply accepted it as an immutable part of the landscape. It's so big that how could it possibly get any bigger? Every newspaper describes it as the \u00a3758m Dome. </p> <p>But of course it isn't. Count in the cost of cleaning up the toxic waste that contaminated the site, the interest payments and any shortfall in paying customers on the original 12 million target and it is clear that it is actually the \u00a31,000m Dome. And if you do count in those essential 'extras', Tony Blair's proud boast that not a penny of public money has gone into the Dome looks rather less than frank. </p> <p>The cash from the Millennium Commission is Lottery-funded, which is not technically public money, though a lot of people might argue that it is. But the \u00a3120m clean-up cost comes directly from English Partnerships, and most certainly is public money. And yet we are still hypnotised by that awesome \u00a3758m. </p> <p>The Scottish Parliament, on the other hand, has been haunted by an early tactical mistake, by announcing a figure that, while it might cover the cost of the parliamentary debating chamber, didn't include fees, site acquisition costs, VAT or that parliamentary office building. </p> <p>But unlike the Dome, Miralles's Parliament is not a heroic one-liner, it's a complex design that responds to its remarkable site between Holyrood and Arthur's Seat. It doesn't shout and, despite Miralles much mocked original image of that pair of upturned boats, it's very hard to caricature. It is all a contemporary parliament should be. </p> <p>Dewar, however , is showing the stamina and perspective that makes for leadership and is fighting back.

Last week, the Scottish Executive admitted that the latest estimate was \u00a3230m. Given that back in 1997, when Enric Miralles, the Catalan architect responsible for the project was appointed, the building was costed at \u00a340m, it is hardly surprising that David Steel, the Parliament's Presiding Officer, should be worried enough to appoint his own assessor to probe the reasons for the apparent quadrupling of the costs. The Scottish press scented blood. They seized on the figures as yet another stick with which to beat Dewar, one that made a welcome change from their onslaught on his determination to repeal Section 28. And it produced, sotto voce , a lot of murmurings about the folly of entrusting such a symbolically charged project to an untested Spaniard with a comic-opera accent, an unpronounceable name and a design that he himself suggested was modelled on a couple of upturned boats sitting on a beach.The Parliament was instantly seized on as Dewar's Dome. But the problem with the Parliament building in Edinburgh is far from being a lack of ideas about its content. In fact, a lot of the extra costs have arisen because absolutely everybody had an idea of what the Parliament should be. Thus, in response to the original brief and its almost touching belief that a new Scotland would want to get away from the confrontational ways of bad old Westminster, Enric Miralles designed a gently curved, intimate debating chamber, rather than put members on opposing sets of benches two sword lengths apart. It was not as hostile as Westminster, nor as formal as a Continental-style amphitheatre chamber. But David Steel thought it looked like a banana and insisted on another fact-finding tour of European parliaments and a redesign. Judging by the vitriol that is flying around the Scottish Parliament in its temporary home in the Church of Scotland assembly building, it takes more than a seating plan to instil a spirit of brotherly love in Scottish MSPs. As with most high-profile cost overruns, it is clients changing their minds who push up figures rather than overweening architects. It was not Terry Farrell's design for the M16 ziggurat, for example, that allowed its costs to run off over the horizon; it was the 'refinements' that the spooks asked for after construction had started that made it so expensive. On part of the Edinburgh site stands a much mutilated but undoubtedly historic seventeenth-century house. It became a requirement that it should be restored and made part of the design of the new Parliament. But then it turned out to be so badly decayed that, as Miralles puts it, 'a gust of wind could blow it down'. More money had to be found to deal with it, rather than run the wrath of conservationists by demolishing it. And then, the MSPs started looking in detail at their offices. Not big enough, they concluded. It might also be added that Scotland's newspaper editors weren't much impressed by the size of the press gallery, either. And so the price grew and grew. And just like the Dome, which was originally adopted by Tony Blair from the nerveless grasp of the outgoing Major administration as a monumental celebration of the achievements of New Labour's first term, Dewar discovered that monument building is a double-edged political strategy. If it works, it creates the upbeat climate of a Barcelona or a Paris. If it doesn't, then the voters turn nasty. But even if the Dome has had a battering on its lack of a coherent strategy and purpose, it has managed to survive remarkably unscathed on the issue of price. Very early on, the Government took what looked to be a big risk. It announced a price so enormous, so colossal, that at \u00a3758m we have simply accepted it as an immutable part of the landscape. It's so big that how could it possibly get any bigger? Every newspaper describes it as the \u00a3758m Dome. But of course it isn't. Count in the cost of cleaning up the toxic waste that contaminated the site, the interest payments and any shortfall in paying customers on the original 12 million target and it is clear that it is actually the \u00a31,000m Dome. And if you do count in those essential 'extras', Tony Blair's proud boast that not a penny of public money has gone into the Dome looks rather less than frank. The cash from the Millennium Commission is Lottery-funded, which is not technically public money, though a lot of people might argue that it is. But the \u00a3120m clean-up cost comes directly from English Partnerships, and most certainly is public money. And yet we are still hypnotised by that awesome \u00a3758m. The Scottish Parliament, on the other hand, has been haunted by an early tactical mistake, by announcing a figure that, while it might cover the cost of the parliamentary debating chamber, didn't include fees, site acquisition costs, VAT or that parliamentary office building. But unlike the Dome, Miralles's Parliament is not a heroic one-liner, it's a complex design that responds to its remarkable site between Holyrood and Arthur's Seat. It doesn't shout and, despite Miralles much mocked original image of that pair of upturned boats, it's very hard to caricature. It is all a contemporary parliament should be. Dewar, however , is showing the stamina and perspective that makes for leadership and is fighting back. He has insisted that the building is redesigned so it does come in on the \u00a3109m target. From his studio in Barcelona, Miralles says that's fine with him and it is perfectly possible to do a great building for that money. Judge it against the \u00a3250m cost of Westminster's unloved Portcullis House, which provides nothing more than parliamentary office space. One Scottish newspaper came up with a front-page story personalising the row to the point of claiming that Miralles, with a fee based on a percentage of the final cost, now stood to make \u00a318m and implied that he had a vested interest in inflating costs. It precisely echoed previous headlines about Denys Lasdun, when the National Theatre was hit by the inflation of the 1970s, and saw galloping cost rises as the result of the pound losing 20 per cent of its value in a year. Jorn Utzon was driven out of Australia by similar headlines about his Sydney Opera House. And, of course, it is nonsense in each case. Miralles is a young and gifted architect, with a reputation to make. He was all but unknown in Britain before he won the competition. In his native Barcelona, he had a certain reputation based on the work he had done for the city in the run-up to the 1992 Olympics, but his built works amounted to an archery stadium and a pergola. The Parliament project is by far the largest thing he has done and the most prominent. It is a signature project and he has to get it right. The pity of the onslaught on Miralles is that just at the moment when Britain was getting round to the idea that it was not a crime for good architecture to be an issue in public buildings, we might be pushed back to an earlier time, when to be seen to be sensitive to architectural issues was in itself regarded as a sign of terminal extravagance. Buildings had to look cheap, even if that could actually be the most expensive option. The truth is that construction projects with no architectural ambition whatsoever are just as likely to run riot financially. Look at the less than inspired Hampden Stadium, the Lottery-funded Glasgow project that is having to be bailed out of bankruptcy, or the extra cash that had to be poured into Cardiff's new rugby stadium to ensure that it opened on time.",

      "body": "<b> Zo\u00eb</b> Glyndebourne, Sussex <br> <b>HMS Pinafore</b> Savoy Theatre, London WC2 <br> <b>Stockhausen</b> Royal Festival Hall, SE1 <p>Hot Dogs rarely feature in the hampers at Glyndebourne's summer idyll. Nor do visitors come in school uniform, preferring a more exclusive conformity. The novel sight of hundreds of teenagers swarming into the theatre was a tonic even before a note had sounded. </p> <p>Following Misper three years ago and written by the same team, <b> Zo\u00eb</b> is Glyndebourne's second commissioned opera for young people. May there be dozens more. The media had already sniffed scandal, announcing a plot based on a juvenile's love affair with a chief inspector of schools. In fact, the girl is 20, the affair with the unmarried college tutor only one of several story lines. If these overblown promises drew advance attention to Glyndebourne's activities, so much the better. The exuberant, hard-hitting piece, more musical theatre than opera, held its audience gripped from start to finish. Standards were impressive, the energy infectious; the only visibly unprofessional aspect was the final bow, which had a rakish and chaotic charm. </p> <p>Stephen Plaice's libretto negotiated every possible preoccupation a young adult might have, from personal to social and political, without clich\u00e9 or embarrassment. Warm, wry wit wins out over irony. As a regular script writer for The Bill , Plaice knows how to handle tough subjects without being heavy handed. Thus first kiss, jealousy, teenage pregnancy, eco-rebellion, citizenship, prison, biotechnology and cloning are woven seamlessly in to a moving drama, lightly held together with a love story. Zo\u00eb, a new college student with a striking resemblance to a famous film actress, turns out to be her clone. Her father, a sinister geneticist, has created her from a lock of his screen-idol's hair. The dramatic consequences have their own, unspoken message. The text moves fast, but the amplification combined with John Lunn's word-friendly music ensure that it is easy to follow. </p> <p>Brighton Youth Orchestra, conducted by James Morgan, made light work of the score, an engaging tapestry of rock, pop, electronic and operatic styles, with an emphasis on melody and strong pulse. Professional singers added another layer of vocal colour, pointing the music towards Puccini in one direction or Bernstein in another. That Lunn could make this doubtful-sounding combination work so convincingly is a tribute to his versatility. Trained in the classical tradition, at home in film and a founder of the experimental group Man Jumping, he has no problem with crossing over, under or in between. </p> <p>The greatest pleasure came from seeing talented 17- and 18-year olds singing and dancing with total commitment. Emily Gilchrist in the title role has a pure, still light but expressive voice. As Gemma, Rebecca Bowden showed real soul and guts. Gemma Ticehurst had powerful stage presence and Mark Enticknap gave a thoughtful performance. Stephen Langridge's production, with stylish designs by Conor Murphy, served them admirably. The whoops and whistles were deserved. </p> <p>D'Oyly Carte, returning to its Savoy home after a long absence, could have learnt a thing or two from Glyndebourne. Gilbert and Sullivan, whatever your view, have long offered the young a route into theatre and opera. Children enjoy the tunes and apprehend the inanity of grown-ups playing at being pirates or fairies, even if Gilbert's satire is lost on them. Parents don't mind going. In the wake of Topsy Turvy , Mike Leigh's loving celebration of G and S, you might have expected a half-term matin\u00e9e of <b> HMS Pinafore </b> to be sold out. Charging children full price (in my case a startling \u00a370 for two) is hardly an incentive. The place was half empty. </p> <p>Martin Duncan's crisply choreographed production, with bright, on-deck designs by Tim Hatley had an over-neat air of having just come back from the dry-cleaners. One of the joys of amateur G and S is studying the spectrum of physical types who make up the chorus line and wondering whether the leading lady will ever find her top note. No one can blame this row of sailors for looking uniformly dapper (even Dick Deadeye only looked slightly gruesome), or the soloists for singing with bright accuracy, yet their precision exposed Sullivan's music as even more lightweight than one had remembered. But there's still enough wit and sparkle to support it. </p> <p>From G and S to Karlheinz Stockhausen is the perfect oxymoronic journey. The nimble septuagenarian guru, still a natty dresser all in white except for a vivid orange woolly, drew crowds for a rare performance of his seminal <b> Gruppen</b> , among the most important compositions of the last half century. Written for three orchestras and three conductors, this study in spatial sound caused panic when first performed in Cologne in 1958. Players complained at its fiendish difficulty, conductors, according to Stockhausen, 'threatened to throw themselves out of windows' if he continued. </p> <p>He did. Now ensembles such as the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by David Robertson, Martyn Brabbins and Pascal Roph\u00e9, tackle it with ease, playing it twice in the same concert. Stockhausen introduced the second performance with a mix of the impenetrable and the audacious. He stated that a concert hall should exist to play this work round the clock. When in 1974 Cornelius Cardew wrote Stockhausen Serves Imperialism , he did not realise that Stockhausen was his own Empire's Emperor. Fortunately, he does have clothes and they are richly woven.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Zo\u00eb Glyndebourne, Sussex HMS Pinafore Savoy Theatre, London WC2 Stockhausen Royal Festival Hall, SE1 Hot Dogs rarely feature in the hampers at Glyndebourne's summer idyll. Nor do visitors come in school uniform, preferring a more exclusive conformity. The novel sight of hundreds of teenagers swarming into the theatre was a tonic even before a note had sounded. Following Misper three years ago and written by the same team, Zo\u00eb is Glyndebourne's second commissioned opera for young people. May there be dozens more. The media had already sniffed scandal, announcing a plot based on a juvenile's love affair with a chief inspector of schools. In fact, the girl is 20, the affair with the unmarried college tutor only one of several story lines. If these overblown promises drew advance attention to Glyndebourne's activities, so much the better. The exuberant, hard-hitting piece, more musical theatre than opera, held its audience gripped from start to finish. Standards were impressive, the energy infectious; the only visibly unprofessional aspect was the final bow, which had a rakish and chaotic charm. Stephen Plaice's libretto negotiated every possible preoccupation a young adult might have, from personal to social and political, without clich\u00e9 or embarrassment. Warm, wry wit wins out over irony. As a regular script writer for The Bill , Plaice knows how to handle tough subjects without being heavy handed. Thus first kiss, jealousy, teenage pregnancy, eco-rebellion, citizenship, prison, biotechnology and cloning are woven seamlessly in to a moving drama, lightly held together with a love story. Zo\u00eb, a new college student with a striking resemblance to a famous film actress, turns out to be her clone. Her father, a sinister geneticist, has created her from a lock of his screen-idol's hair. The dramatic consequences have their own, unspoken message. The text moves fast, but the amplification combined with John Lunn's word-friendly music ensure that it is easy to follow. Brighton Youth Orchestra, conducted by James Morgan, made light work of the score, an engaging tapestry of rock, pop, electronic and operatic styles, with an emphasis on melody and strong pulse. Professional singers added another layer of vocal colour, pointing the music towards Puccini in one direction or Bernstein in another. That Lunn could make this doubtful-sounding combination work so convincingly is a tribute to his versatility. Trained in the classical tradition, at home in film and a founder of the experimental group Man Jumping, he has no problem with crossing over, under or in between. The greatest pleasure came from seeing talented 17- and 18-year olds singing and dancing with total commitment. Emily Gilchrist in the title role has a pure, still light but expressive voice. As Gemma, Rebecca Bowden showed real soul and guts. Gemma Ticehurst had powerful stage presence and Mark Enticknap gave a thoughtful performance. Stephen Langridge's production, with stylish designs by Conor Murphy, served them admirably. The whoops and whistles were deserved. D'Oyly Carte, returning to its Savoy home after a long absence, could have learnt a thing or two from Glyndebourne. Gilbert and Sullivan, whatever your view, have long offered the young a route into theatre and opera. Children enjoy the tunes and apprehend the inanity of grown-ups playing at being pirates or fairies, even if Gilbert's satire is lost on them. Parents don't mind going. In the wake of Topsy Turvy , Mike Leigh's loving celebration of G and S, you might have expected a half-term matin\u00e9e of HMS Pinafore to be sold out. Charging children full price (in my case a startling \u00a370 for two) is hardly an incentive. The place was half empty. Martin Duncan's crisply choreographed production, with bright, on-deck designs by Tim Hatley had an over-neat air of having just come back from the dry-cleaners. One of the joys of amateur G and S is studying the spectrum of physical types who make up the chorus line and wondering whether the leading lady will ever find her top note. No one can blame this row of sailors for looking uniformly dapper (even Dick Deadeye only looked slightly gruesome), or the soloists for singing with bright accuracy, yet their precision exposed Sullivan's music as even more lightweight than one had remembered. But there's still enough wit and sparkle to support it. From G and S to Karlheinz Stockhausen is the perfect oxymoronic journey. The nimble septuagenarian guru, still a natty dresser all in white except for a vivid orange woolly, drew crowds for a rare performance of his seminal Gruppen , among the most important compositions of the last half century. Written for three orchestras and three conductors, this study in spatial sound caused panic when first performed in Cologne in 1958. Players complained at its fiendish difficulty, conductors, according to Stockhausen, 'threatened to throw themselves out of windows' if he continued. He did. Now ensembles such as the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by David Robertson, Martyn Brabbins and Pascal Roph\u00e9, tackle it with ease, playing it twice in the same concert. Stockhausen introduced the second performance with a mix of the impenetrable and the audacious. He stated that a concert hall should exist to play this work round the clock. When in 1974 Cornelius Cardew wrote Stockhausen Serves Imperialism , he did not realise that Stockhausen was his own Empire's Emperor. Fortunately, he does have clothes and they are richly woven.",

In fact, it turned out to be less of a decision than it did a compulsion, because for several months I'd been becoming increasingly fetishistic about the cleanliness of ashtrays and the possibility of lingering smells, not to mention those intimate smokers' horridnesses you rarely hear about: Kleenex emerging from a brisk bit of nose-blowing looking like used pipe cleaners (not all of which can be blamed on urban noxiousness); a semi-permanent nicotine tint on the index and middle fingers; a dog who wrinkled up her sweet wet pink nose and sneezed resignedly whenever one lit up. No, I really didn't know what guilt felt like until I'd turned my dog into a reluctant passive Consulate smoker. And she isn't even a beagle.</p> <p>For the past couple of years my smoking had become irritatingly habitual and instinctive, while offering very little in the way of pleasure. In fact, there was absolutely nothing I liked about the process of smoking any more - not even the paraphernalia (lighters and ashtrays), nor the existential glamour of a smoky twister caught in the light of a low-voltage bulb with Sketches of Spain playing in the background (have you noticed how terrible fag smoke looks in the glare of a halogen spotlight?) In short, I was no longer 'cool' (if ever I had been) - just a thirtysomething with parchmenty skin and the beginnings of fine lines around pursed lips. The cough clinched it, though. By the autumn of last year it was a constant presence, a wheezing Jiminy Cricket perched on my shoulder, whispering its regular, sour, hacking somethings into my ears.</p> <p>I'd given up smoking once before, just over three years previously. Married to a non-smoker, I thought I was doing the decent thing by giving up. After hypnotherapy I had stopped for about three months but, on the night my husband told me he was leaving me, I walked straight round to the 24-hour garage and stocked up on Consulate, as if to say: 'Look what you made me do!' But he hadn't, of course, because you can probably only give up smoking if you are doing it for yourself.</p> <p>Last year, two-and-half years and God knows how many thousands more cigarettes down the line, I was disgusted by the habit, bothered by the permanence of my cough and the tightness of my chest, and tired of feeling like a social pariah (bad tables in restaurants, habitually banished to balconies and gardens in people's homes), so I knew it had to stop. Smoking wasn't me any more - it was just something I did. And, as with most things I do, when I finally made the decision to quit, I made it fast.</p> <p>But how to give up? Willpower alone was not going to be enough, because an uncontrolled experiment had already revealed that, on my own, I could last about an hour - maximum; while in company, I could push it to about two- and-a-half. I wasn't attracted to patches or gum or acupuncture either, because the thing I had loved about hypnotherapy was that it had been instantaneous: after just one session I didn't feel like a smoker so, ironically, I wanted to not feel like a smoker in the same way, but probably with a different hypnotherapist.</p> <p>I found Iain McIntosh in, of all places, the Yellow Pages. He answered the phone himself and was confronted, I suspect, by a garbling madwoman, disappointed to discover that she couldn't get an appointment that very afternoon. I'd already booked for the following week before I remembered to ask the fee. Eek! It was a lot of money but, said McIntosh cheerily, it also came with a 'lifetime guarantee'. I would, he claimed with utter conviction, never smoke again after just one session. That was a hell of a claim.</p> <p>'Yes, but did he actually offer a money-back guarantee?' asked a friend, pertinently, when I told her about this fabulous offer.</p> <p>'No, not exactly,' I had to admit. 'Well, I hope it works!' said the friend, with a hint of sneer. Pah! The gauntlet was already on the floor, to be swiftly followed by a smouldering butt.</p> <p>Wednesday 12 January 2000: it was a good idea to get my final hour as a smoker documented by a photographer, if only because he kept saying, 'Go on, Kate, light another one,' for the purposes of his soi-disant 'art', which meant that by the time I arrived at Harley Street for my appointment with Mr McIntosh, I was beginning to wonder if willpower might not do the trick after all. Pictures of me looking wistful were taken on the stone steps and I suppose there was a sort of nostalgia for that part of my life, but I surprised myself by how much I wanted to get on with it.</p> <p>Mr McIntosh, smiling and smartly suited, in Harley Street via Australia and Scotland and a previous incarnation as a schoolteacher, had the confident air of a man who knows why he's worth the price of three pairs of Prada shoes (\u00a3600) for an hour of his time. This confidence inevitably rubs off. Before we got down to business, he asked me questions in order to best tailor the hypnotherapy to suit my needs. For example, though keen to give up smoking I also wanted some sort of guarantee that I wouldn't replace a pack of cigarettes with, say, 20 Mr Kipling Bakewell tarts and thus end up with the lungs of a newborn inside the body of Giant Haystacks. Mr M quite understood, promising to customise accordingly.</p> <p>Having already been hypnotised, I wasn't nervous about the process, but I allowed Mr McIntosh to reassure me nonetheless. 'I can do 90 per cent of the work,' he explained, 'but the 10 per cent you will have to do will be harder.' By which he meant that when I walked out of the room I would be a non-smoker, but I would have to go through a couple of weeks of cold turkey and avoid the kind of situations and environments - coffee, tea, alcohol, restaurants, pubs and clubs - that I associated with smoking. I assured him that, short of anaesthesia, there wasn't much I didn't associate with smoking.</p> <p>Soon enough, I was heavy-limbed under hypnosis and journeying through a walled garden Mr McIntosh had helped me visualise. Normally, the experience of sitting on a bench under a tree in a sun-dappled corner of a beautiful garden while listening to the sound of birds and insects would demand a Consulate and a nice big glass of Premier Cru Chablis to make the moment truly special, but somehow I struggled through. Then Mr M took me on a journey into my bright clean-lunged future: a week hence, a month down the road, six months, a year\u0085 a happy, fag-free, cake-less 21st century.</p> <p>Roughly 40 minutes later I emerged, tired but resolute. There was a pack of Consulate and a lighter in my pocket which I handed to Mr McIntosh, who promptly filed them in a bin. In exchange, he gave me a tape: 'I don't normally do this, but if you feel yourself flagging you might want to stick it on.' Funny, but within 24 hours I'd lost the tape, without even hearing it.</p> <p>Week one: the hardest bit was discovering how much of my day had previously been taken up with smoking or thinking about smoking. At first there seemed to be a terrifyingly large amount of day left over, to be filled with other things, like Jaffa Cakes. Bugger! And work was difficult. I timed the first Observer TV review I had ever written without a fag burning comfortingly alongside me and it took precisely two-and-a-half times as long as usual. I realised that previously I had used cigarettes as a reward for a paragraph well constructed, as a psychological pat on the back. I was bothered about the Jaffa Cakes, Pringles and cups of coffee, but I also figured this was going to be the worst week of cold turkey, so I shouldn't be too tough on myself. Still, I am altogether much snappier and more brusque, particularly on the phone - but I have also been out for dinner and drunk alcohol without feeling the need for a snout, so I'm chuffed about that.</p> <p>Week two: still snacking for Britain - but do I detect a slightly less abrasive tone when dealing with\u0085 well, everybody really, including the dog? Have broken out in an extraordinary selection of zits, which I can't even blame on PMS ('Healing crisis!' explains a friend, who has been there). Am also coughing even more than usual, replete with dark grey mucus. Even when smoking heavily, I have never coughed up anything other than the loveliest snowy white phlegm and am completely revolted. Almost enough to make one light up, but not quite.</p> <p>Week three: spot-fest still under way, but I would also say that my roaring mood swings are now no more satanic than usual. Others may, of course, beg to differ. Happily, too, the desperately infantile need to have the closest thing to an adult rusk in my mouth at all times seems to be abating. Had had terrifying visions of being forced to buy a giant dummy to satisfy oral fixation. That or\u0085 no, actually, let's not go there.</p> <p>Week four: extraordinary! I forgot to keep the diary this week because\u0085 I forgot there was anything to keep a diary about! At one dinner a friend said, excitedly: 'So, how's it going then?' 'Fine,' I had replied, slightly puzzled by her tone, 'How's it going with you?' 'Well, I've never smoked, remember?' Blimey - it's as if I'd never smoked either!</p> <p>Meanwhile, my sense of smell is so vastly improved that the dog is banned from the bedroom. I always knew she smelt doggy, I just didn't know how doggy. I am also back up to speed with writing (prize cigarettes having been replaced by dancing to Cream Anthems 2000 in the living room), but the very oddest thing is that when I see other people smoking it is like seeing people with, for example, red hair and freckles - something I recognise but which isn't part of my life and doesn't resonate emotionally in any way. In fact, far from triggering a bout of smugness or sanctimonious judgment, smokers barely register with me at all. I must say that, in just four weeks, this feels like an almighty achievement - both for Mr McIntosh and for me. Still, I was clearly ready.

      "body": "<p>As we walk past a swanky staircase in Luton Hoo, the country seat in Bedfordshire noted for its Capability Brown gardens and its large collection of Faberg\u00e9 jewellery, Charles Higson, the comedy writer and televisual personality, points out something which might be of passing intrigue, if one were interested in this sort of thing. That staircase is the very staircase down which an extremely famous supermodel wended her 'sexy' way, mislaying several of her clothes in the process, for a motorcar commercial.</p> <p>Claudia Schiffer aside, Luton Hoo, originally built by Robert Adam in 1767-74, is today a favoured location for film and telly location shooting. And - here's a massive surprise - it's about to be turned into a hotel. So Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) may be the last telly offering to be shot at this magnificent crumbling pile.</p> <p>Charlie Higson, at 40, is already a veteran television comedy writer and performer. He read English and American Literature and Film Studies at the University of East Anglia. Here, he embarked upon an abortive attempt to become a pop star with his grisly band The Higsons. Their last album sold a measly 700 copies. 'I was never a great singer,' he tells me, somewhat crestfallen. 'I was hopeless.'</p> <p>After the demise of The Higsons, he went into partnership with his friend Paul Whitehouse. Their first success came in 1987 on the cult TV show Saturday Night Live, for which they wrote the character of Stavros, a dim but loveable kebab shop proprietor portrayed by Harry Enfield. This was followed by Loadsamoney, a cash-waving irritant, again played by Enfield on Saturday Night Live, who was much imitated by London football fans who taunted Northern rivals by waving money at them in the last days of Thatcherism. 'It was weird to see Loadsamoney so quickly become part of society,' Higson says. 'It is quite exciting when you create something and it becomes part of the cultural backdrop.'</p> <p>Since then, Smashy and Nicey, the disc jockeys portrayed by Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse in the BBC's Harry Enfield television series have become part of our cultural furniture, as has 'Suits you, sir!', a phrase much used by the men's clothes shop assistants played by Whitehouse and Mark Williams in The Fast Show, the BBC2 sketch show that Higson and Whitehouse began writing, producing and performing in 1994. Higson has also turned his hand to writing darkly comical (and hugely successful) novels: King of The Ants (1992), Happy Now (1993), Full Whack (1995) and Getting Rid of Mister Kitchen (1996).</p> <p>But now he is concentrating on Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased). He is writer, producer, and occasional actor in this new version of an elderly TV concoction that ran from 1969-1971 and had as its premise a couple of private eyes, one of whom was dead (hence the name). The dead one had been run over by a motorcar but was able to appear before his living partner in dire situations - thanks to the wonders of filming technology - and offer much-required advice. In short, it was telly nonsense, fit only for the afternoon viewing of students and the unemployed. Spool forward 30 years and here it comes again starring not the original players Mike Pratt (as Jeff Randall) or Kenneth Cope (as Marty Hopkirk) but Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer.</p> <p>Vic Reeves is sporting a white suit just like the one he used to wear on Vic Reeves' Big Night Out. That suit was, in fact, directly nicked from Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased); Kenneth Cope was always dressed in one and the show has always been a favourite of Vic's. We are in a dilapidated room where cameras strut around a cast of men who are acting the parts of zombies, all stiff movements and unblinking eyes. Nothing much else happens. That is the way with filming, sitting around while some curmudgeonly old goat tinkers with lights and a third assistant best boy peers bemusedly at a clip-board.</p> <p>Sitting in a trailer having fake whiskers applied for a scene, Higson explains why they chose this particular show to revive. 'It came about by a slightly roundabout route. Polygram had all the rights to the old ITC programmes: The Champions, Man in a Suitcase, Jason King \u0085' I shuffle in my chair as I consider this 'golden age' of televisual ineptitude and, as the moustache takes some shape, the scriptwriter/actor continues: 'They looked through all of those old programmes to see if any of them would stand up to a re-make. Things like The Champions were very kitschy, 70s flares and sideburns kind of things, so it would have been very difficult to update them without going down the Austin Powers route.</p> <p>'But Vic and Bob thought that Randall and Hopkirk was a very strong central idea because although people have tried to make things like that since, no one had ever done a thing with two detectives where one is dead and has a white suit. Also because it wasn't a series like The Avengers, people wouldn't get very precious about it. They would remember the white suit and that was about it. Anyway, Vic and Bob had been looking for some time to do a mainstream family adventure acting project and they had a ready-made partnership and that slightly off-beat humour that would work with the supernatural element.'</p> <p>Despite the casting, the show, he insists, will be more than just a send-up. 'We said from the start that we had no interest in making it kitschy and a spoof. Because you've got to care about the characters, you've got to care about the plot. And you can't do that with a stream of gags. Vic and Bob wanted to do something that was a bit more serious than their other stuff. And I had, for a long time, been wanting to write something like The Prisoner - a big, escapist fantasy story which nobody makes anymore. You look at telly these days and it's all docu-soaps and it's Britain in your face. Which is fine. But I wanted to do something with a bit more sense of fun, so we set out to do a Saturday Night type thing - which is quite difficult to pull off. We were trying to get a timeless feel to it.'</p> <p>The episode I am witness to is set in a loony bin for rich people not unlike the Priory. 'It's quite fun to have a go at these establishment things,' says Higson, a cheeky smile left playing around his sticky, fake-bearded chin. Among the guest stars appearing in the series are Richard Todd (star of the classic war flick The Dam Busters), Tom Baker (once a Doctor Who) and Dudley Sutton (bloke who once appeared, about a squillion years ago, in a motorbike film called The Leather Boys). 'Steven Berkoff is a secondary villain in this episode, too, and people assure me that it's going to look fantastic and reasonably outrageous. And we've got Charles Dance in the first episode. And I'm playing a zombie\u0085'</p> <p>Dance, it appears, is 'a big Vic and Bob fan and a big Fast Show fan. It's been a good project like that: people really respond in that it isn't the normal thing they are asked to do. They can come in and enjoy themselves a bit.'</p> <p>As for Richard Todd, well The Dam Busters is the first film Higson can remember seeing. 'I remember as a kid, you'd go to the cinema and you'd just turn up at anytime. You'd go in in the middle of a film and just sit and watch it round again. I remember going to see The Dam Busters like that; I went in and there were big dams exploding. But it didn't spoil it. There's something nice about watching films like that. Whenever the new James Bond film came out, you'd have an old James Bond film with it in a double bill. So, God knows how many times I've seen Doctor No.'</p> <p>The chatter turns to discussion of the Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer. 'I saw their live show years ago and I just thought it was the funniest thing I'd ever seen. I asked them if they wanted any help and they said, \"Yeah, you can come along and wear 20-foot-long trousers.\" It's nice to work on that level of being just a fan. But Vic is a pretty complicated type of bloke, and I don't know if I've ever really got through to the inner him.</p> <p>'As for Bob, I've had lots of chats with him, but afterwards you think, \"Was half of that completely made up?\" And the extraordinary things that you think must have been lies turn out to be actually true, and the mundane things he comes up with are made up. Having Bob to a dinner party is probably the worst thing that Bob could imagine. He has a terrible habit of going to the toilet at parties and you never see him again. I've asked them to do social things, but they never turn up. Could I ever get them round to my house? No. But I do love working with them. They are fun to work with - once they've decided to take it seriously.'</p> <p>Of the characters he has created for television, Higson tells me that it is The Fast Show 's Ralph - the land-owning gent with an unrequited crush on his servant Ted - for whom he feels fondest. 'He's the first character of any substance that I did on the telly. I wasn't originally going to play the part. We were looking for a John Cleese-type actor to make up the numbers, but we never found anyone, so I ended up doing it by default. I really enjoy playing Ralph and I still enjoy watching The Fast Show. They had repeats on recently, and I know you're not supposed to sit and laugh at your stuff, but I do. My wife always tells me off, but it entertains me.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "As we walk past a swanky staircase in Luton Hoo, the country seat in Bedfordshire noted for its Capability Brown gardens and its large collection of Faberg\u00e9 jewellery, Charles Higson, the comedy writer and televisual personality, points out something which might be of passing intrigue, if one were interested in this sort of thing. That staircase is the very staircase down which an extremely famous supermodel wended her 'sexy' way, mislaying several of her clothes in the process, for a motorcar commercial. Claudia Schiffer aside, Luton Hoo, originally built by Robert Adam in 1767-74, is today a favoured location for film and telly location shooting. And - here's a massive surprise - it's about to be turned into a hotel. So Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased) may be the last telly offering to be shot at this magnificent crumbling pile. Charlie Higson, at 40, is already a veteran television comedy writer and performer. He read English and American Literature and Film Studies at the University of East Anglia. Here, he embarked upon an abortive attempt to become a pop star with his grisly band The Higsons. Their last album sold a measly 700 copies. 'I was never a great singer,' he tells me, somewhat crestfallen. 'I was hopeless.' After the demise of The Higsons, he went into partnership with his friend Paul Whitehouse. Their first success came in 1987 on the cult TV show Saturday Night Live, for which they wrote the character of Stavros, a dim but loveable kebab shop proprietor portrayed by Harry Enfield. This was followed by Loadsamoney, a cash-waving irritant, again played by Enfield on Saturday Night Live, who was much imitated by London football fans who taunted Northern rivals by waving money at them in the last days of Thatcherism. 'It was weird to see Loadsamoney so quickly become part of society,' Higson says. 'It is quite exciting when you create something and it becomes part of the cultural backdrop.' Since then, Smashy and Nicey, the disc jockeys portrayed by Harry Enfield and Paul Whitehouse in the BBC's Harry Enfield television series have become part of our cultural furniture, as has 'Suits you, sir!', a phrase much used by the men's clothes shop assistants played by Whitehouse and Mark Williams in The Fast Show, the BBC2 sketch show that Higson and Whitehouse began writing, producing and performing in 1994. Higson has also turned his hand to writing darkly comical (and hugely successful) novels: King of The Ants (1992), Happy Now (1993), Full Whack (1995) and Getting Rid of Mister Kitchen (1996). But now he is concentrating on Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased). He is writer, producer, and occasional actor in this new version of an elderly TV concoction that ran from 1969-1971 and had as its premise a couple of private eyes, one of whom was dead (hence the name). The dead one had been run over by a motorcar but was able to appear before his living partner in dire situations - thanks to the wonders of filming technology - and offer much-required advice. In short, it was telly nonsense, fit only for the afternoon viewing of students and the unemployed. Spool forward 30 years and here it comes again starring not the original players Mike Pratt (as Jeff Randall) or Kenneth Cope (as Marty Hopkirk) but Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer. Vic Reeves is sporting a white suit just like the one he used to wear on Vic Reeves' Big Night Out. That suit was, in fact, directly nicked from Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased); Kenneth Cope was always dressed in one and the show has always been a favourite of Vic's. We are in a dilapidated room where cameras strut around a cast of men who are acting the parts of zombies, all stiff movements and unblinking eyes. Nothing much else happens. That is the way with filming, sitting around while some curmudgeonly old goat tinkers with lights and a third assistant best boy peers bemusedly at a clip-board. Sitting in a trailer having fake whiskers applied for a scene, Higson explains why they chose this particular show to revive. 'It came about by a slightly roundabout route. Polygram had all the rights to the old ITC programmes: The Champions, Man in a Suitcase, Jason King \u0085' I shuffle in my chair as I consider this 'golden age' of televisual ineptitude and, as the moustache takes some shape, the scriptwriter/actor continues: 'They looked through all of those old programmes to see if any of them would stand up to a re-make. Things like The Champions were very kitschy, 70s flares and sideburns kind of things, so it would have been very difficult to update them without going down the Austin Powers route. 'But Vic and Bob thought that Randall and Hopkirk was a very strong central idea because although people have tried to make things like that since, no one had ever done a thing with two detectives where one is dead and has a white suit. Also because it wasn't a series like The Avengers, people wouldn't get very precious about it. They would remember the white suit and that was about it. Anyway, Vic and Bob had been looking for some time to do a mainstream family adventure acting project and they had a ready-made partnership and that slightly off-beat humour that would work with the supernatural element.' Despite the casting, the show, he insists, will be more than just a send-up. 'We said from the start that we had no interest in making it kitschy and a spoof. Because you've got to care about the characters, you've got to care about the plot. And you can't do that with a stream of gags. Vic and Bob wanted to do something that was a bit more serious than their other stuff. And I had, for a long time, been wanting to write something like The Prisoner - a big, escapist fantasy story which nobody makes anymore. You look at telly these days and it's all docu-soaps and it's Britain in your face. Which is fine. But I wanted to do something with a bit more sense of fun, so we set out to do a Saturday Night type thing - which is quite difficult to pull off. We were trying to get a timeless feel to it.' The episode I am witness to is set in a loony bin for rich people not unlike the Priory. 'It's quite fun to have a go at these establishment things,' says Higson, a cheeky smile left playing around his sticky, fake-bearded chin. Among the guest stars appearing in the series are Richard Todd (star of the classic war flick The Dam Busters), Tom Baker (once a Doctor Who) and Dudley Sutton (bloke who once appeared, about a squillion years ago, in a motorbike film called The Leather Boys). 'Steven Berkoff is a secondary villain in this episode, too, and people assure me that it's going to look fantastic and reasonably outrageous. And we've got Charles Dance in the first episode. And I'm playing a zombie\u0085' Dance, it appears, is 'a big Vic and Bob fan and a big Fast Show fan. It's been a good project like that: people really respond in that it isn't the normal thing they are asked to do. They can come in and enjoy themselves a bit.' As for Richard Todd, well The Dam Busters is the first film Higson can remember seeing. 'I remember as a kid, you'd go to the cinema and you'd just turn up at anytime. You'd go in in the middle of a film and just sit and watch it round again. I remember going to see The Dam Busters like that; I went in and there were big dams exploding. But it didn't spoil it. There's something nice about watching films like that. Whenever the new James Bond film came out, you'd have an old James Bond film with it in a double bill. So, God knows how many times I've seen Doctor No.' The chatter turns to discussion of the Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer. 'I saw their live show years ago and I just thought it was the funniest thing I'd ever seen. I asked them if they wanted any help and they said, \"Yeah, you can come along and wear 20-foot-long trousers.\" It's nice to work on that level of being just a fan. But Vic is a pretty complicated type of bloke, and I don't know if I've ever really got through to the inner him. 'As for Bob, I've had lots of chats with him, but afterwards you think, \"Was half of that completely made up?\" And the extraordinary things that you think must have been lies turn out to be actually true, and the mundane things he comes up with are made up. Having Bob to a dinner party is probably the worst thing that Bob could imagine. He has a terrible habit of going to the toilet at parties and you never see him again. I've asked them to do social things, but they never turn up. Could I ever get them round to my house? No. But I do love working with them. They are fun to work with - once they've decided to take it seriously.' Of the characters he has created for television, Higson tells me that it is The Fast Show 's Ralph - the land-owning gent with an unrequited crush on his servant Ted - for whom he feels fondest. 'He's the first character of any substance that I did on the telly. I wasn't originally going to play the part. We were looking for a John Cleese-type actor to make up the numbers, but we never found anyone, so I ended up doing it by default. I really enjoy playing Ralph and I still enjoy watching The Fast Show. They had repeats on recently, and I know you're not supposed to sit and laugh at your stuff, but I do. My wife always tells me off, but it entertains me.'",

Our desks faced each other, and I remember how he would hide all his sketches under a pile of books, just like a schoolboy, afraid that someone would pinch his ideas. He was very secretive indeed. <p>After a while, we decided to share an apartment together. From there, we started doing our own freelance projects for various Italian labels. Domenico would always get the best jobs, and some of them were just too much for him to do alone, so he would ask me to help.

      "bodyText": "Stefano Gabbana I first met Domenico Dolce in Milan 19 years ago, where we both worked as assistant designers in the same studio. Our desks faced each other, and I remember how he would hide all his sketches under a pile of books, just like a schoolboy, afraid that someone would pinch his ideas. He was very secretive indeed. After a while, we decided to share an apartment together. From there, we started doing our own freelance projects for various Italian labels. Domenico would always get the best jobs, and some of them were just too much for him to do alone, so he would ask me to help.

It confirmed my long-held belief that people will believe what they wish to believe, whatever the facts. The facts are that there is growing disillusion with New Labour throughout the UK. Not because of 'control freakery' or the 'dark forces of conservatism' but quite simply because of the Government's ready abandonment of the promises, commitments and policy statements made when in Opposition. Miracles were not expected after the last election, the problems were too serious and deep seated for instant cures, but what was expected was that commitments previously made would start to be implemented. <br><b> C.P. Cooper </b> <br>Barnsley <br>S Yorks</p> <p>\u0095 It would appear that Lord Bragg has yet to awaken from the vinous reverie that made him miss the dawn of Tony's Brave New World, otherwise he might have tempered his embar rassing hagiography. Mandelson's loan, Northern Ireland, humanitarian bombing in Kosovo, Iraq, GM U-turn, Railtrack U-turn, Alun Michael fiasco, China visit protesters gagged , the Labour Mayoral election - all swept away by the Bragg gush. But then this particular Tony crony - oops, sorry about the canard - long ago lost all objectivity, witness his S outh Bank plug for Michael Douglas. <br><b> William Golden </b> <br>Rothwell <br>Northamptonshire</p> <p>\u0095 Praising Mr Blair and his policies, Melvyn Bragg writes, 'Keir Hardie will be smiling in his grave'. MPs have just received an increase in salary of \u00a326 per week. State pensions for the elderly are due to rise by 75p per week. Thus the gap between rich and poor is widened. Keir Hardie may be weeping in his grave. <br><b> John Close </b> <br>Glasgow</p> <p>\u0095 The irony that Melvyn Bragg writes an article in praise of the Prime Minister, from the House of Lords, to which he was appointed by no less than the Prime Minister, appears utterly lost on Lord Bragg. No wonder New Labour is rapidly losing the plot. <br><b> John Killah </b> <br>Frome</p>",

It confirmed my long-held belief that people will believe what they wish to believe, whatever the facts. The facts are that there is growing disillusion with New Labour throughout the UK. Not because of 'control freakery' or the 'dark forces of conservatism' but quite simply because of the Government's ready abandonment of the promises, commitments and policy statements made when in Opposition. Miracles were not expected after the last election, the problems were too serious and deep seated for instant cures, but what was expected was that commitments previously made would start to be implemented. C.P. Cooper Barnsley S Yorks \u0095 It would appear that Lord Bragg has yet to awaken from the vinous reverie that made him miss the dawn of Tony's Brave New World, otherwise he might have tempered his embar rassing hagiography. Mandelson's loan, Northern Ireland, humanitarian bombing in Kosovo, Iraq, GM U-turn, Railtrack U-turn, Alun Michael fiasco, China visit protesters gagged , the Labour Mayoral election - all swept away by the Bragg gush. But then this particular Tony crony - oops, sorry about the canard - long ago lost all objectivity, witness his S outh Bank plug for Michael Douglas. William Golden Rothwell Northamptonshire \u0095 Praising Mr Blair and his policies, Melvyn Bragg writes, 'Keir Hardie will be smiling in his grave'. MPs have just received an increase in salary of \u00a326 per week. State pensions for the elderly are due to rise by 75p per week. Thus the gap between rich and poor is widened. Keir Hardie may be weeping in his grave. John Close Glasgow \u0095 The irony that Melvyn Bragg writes an article in praise of the Prime Minister, from the House of Lords, to which he was appointed by no less than the Prime Minister, appears utterly lost on Lord Bragg. No wonder New Labour is rapidly losing the plot. John Killah Frome",

The entertainer with a spotless private life, whose rise to stardom from the slums of Tel Aviv chimed so well with Israel's self-image as a land of opportunity, had died of complications from Aids.</p> <p>In the days since the front-page report in the Haaretz newspaper - which has yet to be confirmed by Haza's ferociously private family -- there has been intense debate on radio and television chat shows on whether the press was right to reveal the cause of the singer's death.</p> <p>The focus has been not on the attitudes of a still traditional society but on assigning blame. Haza's husband of two years, businessman Doron Ashkenazi, emerged in weekend supplements on Friday as the favourite villain.</p> <p>'We just could not believe such a thing could happen to Ofra, because Ofra was like a saint,' says Tsedi Tsarfati, a music director who worked with Haza for 15 years. 'The first time I saw her holding hands with a man was at the henna ceremony one week before her marriage. In my mind, she was like a nun, and all Israelis think this way, although they might not say it: she can't be married, she can't be with a man, and there is no way she could have Aids. We have to blame somebody because we just can't understand this.'</p> <p>If Haza, who was 41, did indeed die of Aids - and the reports have not been denied - she would be Israel's first celebrity known to have done so, and Haza's fame was international. Introducing her soulful version of Yemenite music to European audiences in the Eighties with the much-sampled 'Im Nin Alu' hit, she went on to perform at the Nobel prize ceremony honouring the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, and to provide backing music on Hollywood film scores. She sang the role of Moses's mother in the animated film Prince of Egypt .</p> <p>Israelis loved her because she was a living success story. She began making her escape from the poverty of her Hatikva neighbourhood in south Tel Aviv while still a teenager. The clutter of mean, narrow streets has been home to waves of poor immigrants. In Haza's youth it was a ghetto for Jews from Yemen, Iraq and Morocco who came to Israel after independence only to wind up as second-class citizens in the Zionist state. The European cultural \u00e9lite called them primitive.</p> <p>Haza was the youngest in a Yemenite family of nine, who overcame their misgivings about letting a daughter out in an alien world when a local impresario set up a theatre group. Haza began touring kibbutzim and small towns, and went on to entertain the troops in the Sinai and Golan during the October 1973 war.</p> <p>She was always a trouper, her friends recall. 'Everybody loved her,' says Mikhail Sinuani, another Hatikva resident. 'She was never spoilt. During the war, there were times when we could not shower for a week or two, we were in bunkers, but she never complained.'</p> <p>But even after she made it big, Haza evidently felt unable to tell her fans about her illness, which is what prompted Haaretz to break a taboo -- and strict privacy laws - to announce she had Aids. In the resulting furore, staff at the hospital, who are furious that they were not told, demanded an inquiry into her stay there.</p> <p>'We are talking about a human disease which in our eyes is just like any other disease,' Yoel Esteron, the deputy editor of Haaretz, told a talk show last week. 'The more the days passed, and the more this conspiracy of secrecy grew to reach monstrous dimensions, the more we thought we ought to publish. Isn't it time the citizens of Israel relate to Aids as they do to cancer or dysentery?'</p> <p>Maybe not. Aviram Germanovitch, executive director of the Israel Aids Task Force in Tel Aviv, says the organisation's hotline has 'exploded' from the volume of calls since the story broke, and that the number of clients at its anonymous testing centres has doubled. Testing centres at hospitals report a similar pattern.</p> <p>He argues it is unrealistic to suppose that Israel can banish the stigma attached to the disease so long as the Health Ministry spends just seven US cents per citizen on Aids awareness -- compared to an average of $1.50 in the European Union. Although Israel officially has 2,500 peo ple with HIV, the United Nations and the local Aids Task Force say the true number is four times that figure.</p> <p>'The whole hoo-ha about Ofra Haza has brought a microscope on what is happening in this country,' Germanovitch, who is HIV positive, said. 'The majority of people with HIV are living in secrecy, and in fear of being discovered, and having to live with shame. Magic Johnson took the issue and he made a great leap forward in awareness. He said: \"This Aids thing, it's a virus, it's not me.\" But we have not had anyone like that in Israel.'</p> <p>In hindsight, Haza was a most unlikely emissary for Aids awareness. In the entertainment world, she re-mained a mystery even to her closest collaborators. For 27 years she was the virtual property of her manager, Bezalel Aloni, who, other singers say, kept her aloof from her colleagues. She lived in the second half of a duplex with the Aloni family, breaking free only when she married Ashkenazi.</p> <p>According to Aloni, that was her undoing, and he was so bitter at the manner of her death that he did not attend her funeral.

      "body": "<p>The spectre of a new Biafra is haunting Nigeria, after a wave of sectarian killings that may have claimed 2,000 lives.</p> <p>Over the last fortnight, gangs of Christians and Muslims have been slaughtering each other, using guns, clubs, swords, machetes, bows and arrows and the infamous African 'necklaces': tyres put over the head, doused in petrol and then set on fire.</p> <p>In the northern city of Kaduna alone, it is estimated 1,000 may have died. Mortuaries ran out of room for the dead and corpses had to be piled up on the floor. Mounds of red earth - mass graves, to prevent the outbreak of disease - have sprung up around the city.</p> <p>Kaduna's communal killings were ignited by the controversial plans of some northern Nigerian states to introduce Sharia, the strict Islamic code of justice. A Christian march against the plan turned into a riot, and the violence spread like bushfire to other parts of this vast country, the most populous in Africa. In the south-eastern city of Aba, Christian Ibos went on the rampage when bodies of their friends or relatives were shipped home from Kaduna. The death toll in Aba was another 400 at least. Once unleashed, this cycle of revenge is hard to stop.</p> <p>A young Christian vigilante in the Rigasa district of Kaduna told me he had no choice but to fight. 'The Muslims came at us with everything. We had to defend ourselves, we had to fight back.' He took me down a lonely back street, which was still littered with rotting and bloated corpses.</p> <p>Pigs were nibbling away at the dead, who often lie just a yard or two from the front door of their homes. Victims were dragged out and would then have their religion checked, before they were either freed or put to death. Some were judged by the fervour with which they could reply to a religious incantation. Others, often the more prosperous, were denounced by jealous neighbours. My Muslim driver told me he now carries a Bible in his car, in case he is accosted by Christian militants.</p> <p>In mixed districts, the gangs were careful whom and what they attacked. On a street corner in Kaduna, there are two petrol stations next to each other: the Muslim one has been razed, the Christian one hasn't been touched. The hatred was meticulous: in a gutted church, the face of a stone statuette of Jesus was gouged out.</p> <p>Eye-witnesses say unemployed youths of both religions roamed around the city clutching cans of petrol. Systematically, they set light to houses, businesses and human beings. Entire districts have been destroyed. Kaduna looks like a war zone.</p> <p>Both Christians and Muslims were quite simply attempting to exterminate their rival community, and over a three-day period they set about it with a zeal and clinical efficiency.</p> <p>'My father had his throat slit,' said Emmanuel Dogara, a Catholic. 'He was slaughtered like a goat, while my mother was stabbed and beaten senseless. Jesus says we should love our neighbours as we love ourselves, but we are frightened. We cannot live with them.'</p> <p>Like thousands of others, from both religious communities, Emmanuel is joining a panic-stricken exodus out of Kaduna. 'Most likely there'll be more violence,' predicted Charles Ibeh, a Christian Ibo who decided to seek protection in the city's army barracks. 'They've already written on our homes that we've been sentenced to death.'</p> <p>In a Catholic missionary hospital, Adamu Haruna, a Muslim, had just regained consciousness after being clubbed and stoned. His mistake was to be driving around with a message from the Koran plastered across his windscreen.</p> <p>Ironically, Adamu, a Muslim attacked by Christians, is now being treated by Christians. But the hospital is so basic that flies swarm over the patients' open wounds. A terribly burnt boy, 12 years old, was trying to swat them away. A mob had wrapped him in dried grass and set it alight.</p> <p>The violence amounts to an awesome test for President Olusegun Obasanjo, elected just a year ago, and for Nigeria's new democracy. There are some who suggest discontented elements within the army may have helped orchestrate the violence, in order to have an excuse for seizing back power.</p> <p>Aliyo Abdul Hamid was a boy in Biafra, and agonising memories of the conflict linger within him.

      "bodyText": "The spectre of a new Biafra is haunting Nigeria, after a wave of sectarian killings that may have claimed 2,000 lives. Over the last fortnight, gangs of Christians and Muslims have been slaughtering each other, using guns, clubs, swords, machetes, bows and arrows and the infamous African 'necklaces': tyres put over the head, doused in petrol and then set on fire. In the northern city of Kaduna alone, it is estimated 1,000 may have died. Mortuaries ran out of room for the dead and corpses had to be piled up on the floor. Mounds of red earth - mass graves, to prevent the outbreak of disease - have sprung up around the city. Kaduna's communal killings were ignited by the controversial plans of some northern Nigerian states to introduce Sharia, the strict Islamic code of justice. A Christian march against the plan turned into a riot, and the violence spread like bushfire to other parts of this vast country, the most populous in Africa. In the south-eastern city of Aba, Christian Ibos went on the rampage when bodies of their friends or relatives were shipped home from Kaduna. The death toll in Aba was another 400 at least. Once unleashed, this cycle of revenge is hard to stop. A young Christian vigilante in the Rigasa district of Kaduna told me he had no choice but to fight. 'The Muslims came at us with everything. We had to defend ourselves, we had to fight back.' He took me down a lonely back street, which was still littered with rotting and bloated corpses. Pigs were nibbling away at the dead, who often lie just a yard or two from the front door of their homes. Victims were dragged out and would then have their religion checked, before they were either freed or put to death. Some were judged by the fervour with which they could reply to a religious incantation. Others, often the more prosperous, were denounced by jealous neighbours. My Muslim driver told me he now carries a Bible in his car, in case he is accosted by Christian militants. In mixed districts, the gangs were careful whom and what they attacked. On a street corner in Kaduna, there are two petrol stations next to each other: the Muslim one has been razed, the Christian one hasn't been touched. The hatred was meticulous: in a gutted church, the face of a stone statuette of Jesus was gouged out. Eye-witnesses say unemployed youths of both religions roamed around the city clutching cans of petrol. Systematically, they set light to houses, businesses and human beings. Entire districts have been destroyed. Kaduna looks like a war zone. Both Christians and Muslims were quite simply attempting to exterminate their rival community, and over a three-day period they set about it with a zeal and clinical efficiency. 'My father had his throat slit,' said Emmanuel Dogara, a Catholic. 'He was slaughtered like a goat, while my mother was stabbed and beaten senseless. Jesus says we should love our neighbours as we love ourselves, but we are frightened. We cannot live with them.' Like thousands of others, from both religious communities, Emmanuel is joining a panic-stricken exodus out of Kaduna. 'Most likely there'll be more violence,' predicted Charles Ibeh, a Christian Ibo who decided to seek protection in the city's army barracks. 'They've already written on our homes that we've been sentenced to death.' In a Catholic missionary hospital, Adamu Haruna, a Muslim, had just regained consciousness after being clubbed and stoned. His mistake was to be driving around with a message from the Koran plastered across his windscreen. Ironically, Adamu, a Muslim attacked by Christians, is now being treated by Christians. But the hospital is so basic that flies swarm over the patients' open wounds. A terribly burnt boy, 12 years old, was trying to swat them away. A mob had wrapped him in dried grass and set it alight. The violence amounts to an awesome test for President Olusegun Obasanjo, elected just a year ago, and for Nigeria's new democracy. There are some who suggest discontented elements within the army may have helped orchestrate the violence, in order to have an excuse for seizing back power. Aliyo Abdul Hamid was a boy in Biafra, and agonising memories of the conflict linger within him. Three decades on, he lives in Kaduna, or rather he did. His comfortable home, equipped with satellite television, is now a charred shell. 'No one who was in Biafra wants to see such a thing ever again. Nigeria breaking up is hard to believe, but these events have given everyone a shock. Now you can't trust your neighbour any more.' The trouble is that many of the young killers here are not old enough to remember the horror of Biafra. \u0095 Ben Brown is Foreign Affairs Correspondent for the BBC.",

No industry insider is prepared to predict how long it may be, for instance, before an 'ordinary' person gets hurt or killed in a real-life act for the camera, or a network is bankrupted in a barrage of multi-million dollar lawsuits. CBS thinks it's a risk worth taking. Undeterred by the Fox fiasco, it plans two new 'reality' series this summer: Survivor , a show inspired by Castaways, stranding contestants on a desert island to compete for $1 million; and Big Brother , in which volunteers will live in a house full of cameras and microphones recording every move they make. 'I think this train has left the station, and nothing, not even Rick Rockwell can derail it,' says Thompson. 'Next year we'll look back to the quiz craze inspired by ABC's Who Wants to Be A Millionaire? and I bet all the Fox, CBS and NBC spin-offs, even Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire , will probably look classy.'",

      "body": "<p>In the sixties she was the high priestess of the avant-garde, and America's most Parisian intellectual. She took the French New Wave to New York and forced the American Old Wave to bow to its superior aesthetic. She could not write about the new art or the new cinema or the new music without striving for a superior vocabulary. She could not invent a new term without that term becoming the standard cultural lexicon. She was the one who made it witty to be camp. She sent an entire generation of photographers on 'social safari'. She herself went on numerous political safaris - to oppose the wars in Vietnam, in Bosnia, and in Kosovo, to fight for human rights in all those places and everywhere else, too. </p> <p>Everywhere she went, she wore the sort of scruffy clothes that made you think she was in the middle of painting a house and had just dashed out for a pack of cigarettes. But no matter what she wore, she looked beautiful, glamorous, passionately committed - and terrifying. Nothing could faze this woman. When she fell ill with cancer in the late Seventies, she refused to stop work, or even take time off to feel sorry about herself. Instead she wrote an extraordinary book called Illness as Metaphor in which she argued that it was very bad for your health to think about illness metaphorically. Years later, when she sat down to do her research for the sequel, AIDS and its Metaphors , she found that her ideas had so influenced the earlier discussion of the epidemic that she felt like a plagiarist. But then she found a way to advance beyond her own metaphors. Yet again, her friends and associates shook their heads with admiration and wondered where it was she got her relentless energy. Behind her back, her enemies derided her for her relentless arrogance. They nicknamed her 'Old Skunk Head' - in reference to her famous lock of white hair - but she is unlikely to know this, as no one ever ever dared to use that nickname to her face. </p> <p>They kept quiet, too, when she did that infamous 'sixty-something as sex kitten' photo-shoot for her companion, Annie Leibowitz. It was only behind closed doors that they agreed kitten was not quite appropriate for a woman of her great height, and started referring to her as 'the lynx'. But now she has done something that could destroy her mystique forever. She's gone and written an historical romance, In America , that Michiko Kakutani of the New York Times calls a 'banal, flat-footed narrative - a thoroughly conventional imitation of a thoroughly conventional nineteenth-century novel'. This is not her first work of fiction, and not her first historical romance. That came out eight years ago. It was about Nelson and his mistress. But it was still very, very brainy. Kakutani called it 'enthralling - an encyclopaedic novel of ideas'. It had so many twists and games that you could easily think Sontag had gone post-modern.</p> <p>Certainly no one could say that about the new book. So, people are daring to ask, what is going on? Has she lost her touch, or was she always like this, and we were just too cowed to say so in public? It is nice to know that there is still a place in the world where people argue about such things. Only in New York, you might say. Only in the New Yorker . In the new issue, an old friend of Susan Sontag, named Joan Acocella, comes out in passionate defence of Sontag's artistic U-turn. She claims that, in spite of all those anti-trad essays that made her name, Sontag's heart always did belong to Hawthorne and George Eliot. What's more, those essays made her miserable, as the form never allowed her to express her full nature. 'I was involved in an intense self-mortification,' Acocella quotes Sontag as saying. 'Those essays aren't just austere, they're positively ascetic, as if I didn't trust the sensuality of my imagination. I was afraid of getting lost. I just wanted to support things that were good, and that would be improving to people, and that was natural to me, because I always had a moralistic frame of mind.' </p> <p>Acocella goes on to insist that Sontag was never really avant-garde. She was, at heart, always a child of the nineteenth century. This was partly to do with her odd and lonely childhood. She was born in 1933 and her father, whom she hardly knew, died when she was very young. Her mother, who was a rather serious secret drinker, hardly ever talked to her. She found her salvation in the Modern Library classics series. This only served to widen intellectual gap between her and her classmates. She'd read so much by the time she was 15 that her teacher decided that she should leave high school then and there and go straight to college. She started at UC Berkeley and then transferred to the University of Chicago. By the age of 17, she was married to the scholar Phillip Rieff. She was 19 when she gave birth to David, her one and only child. And then it was off to graduate school at Harvard. </p> <p>It was a good time to be there, thanks to the brain drain from Hitler's Germany. The best year was the year Herbert Marcuse was their lodger. It was ideas, ideas, ideas, from dawn to dusk. Little David would toddle around saying 'Hegel, Hegel, Hegel'. So when the marriage ended, and Sontag and son moved to New York, and she had her first real look at contemporary culture, it really did shock her. If she had something compelling and original to say about it, it was because she was looking at it through a sensibility that was still, Acocella and Sontag now claim, deeply rooted in European phil and lit. And so they still are. According to this new gospel, it's not Sontag that's changed her tune. It's the rest of the world. 'It never occurred to me that all the stuff I had cherished, and all the people I had cared about in my university education, could be dethroned. All that would happen is that you would set up an annex - you know, a playhouse - in which you could study these naughty people, who challenged things. And you could have it all! Little did I know that the avant-garde transgressiveness of the Sixties was to become absolutely institutionalised and that most of the gods of high culture would be dethroned and mocked.' </p> <p>In her view, she is still streets ahead of the rest of us. To write a conventional novel in this day and age, to dare to pay homage to the gods of high culture when everyone else is cutting them up into witty little pieces - this is really taking a big risk. To be sure, Sontag hedges her risks by never reading her book reviews. On and off the printed page she has little time for people who disagree with her. She makes no secret of the fact that she considers herself and her son David to be intellectually superior to all other living beings. According to one long-time associate, she has not had a proper argument for years. This self-willed isolation has, this person believes, dulled her senses. People don't argue with Sontag because life is already dangerous enough even when you are agreeing with her. </p> <p>I had a taste of this myself about 10 years ago, when I was deputised to drive her and her son David around Miami. My first mistake was to apologise for the age and sorry state of my car. This made her snort in disgust. 'Oh my God, what a stupid thing to say. Do you think someone like me cares about cars?' My next mistake was to obey her when she commanded me to park in a space that was a little too tight. When she saw I was having trouble, she began to shriek, 'Don't tell me I am going to have to teach you to parallel park, too!' And then she tried, her shriek getting worse with my every mistake. It was, 'Go right! Go left! No, I said right! I mean, left!' Finally it was, 'This is just awful. Get out of the car! I'm going to have to have my son do this.' Afterwards I got even by collecting other Sontag anecdotes. My favourite is the one where she is looking at an invitation to the premi\u00e8re of a little theatre production of one of her plays, trying to decide whether or not she should go. She asks herself: 'Would Kafka do it? No. Would Proust do it? No. So fuck it.' She was not speaking ironically. She really does put herself on the same pedestal as Kafka, Proust, Mann, Canetti, and George Eliot. </p> <p>But this cannot be an easy place to live. It may be that she has no time for other people's criticisms because she knows no one could set standards more punishing than the ones she sets herself. As one former friend said to me, she must be very lonely. When she started out, she was one politically engaged intellectual among many. Now she's the only one left, all the others having 'thrown in the towel and joined low culture'. But she's still soldiering on, still daring to look people straight in the face to say, 'All my work says be serious, be passionate, wake up.' There's something rather admirable about her refusal to forget her fallen idols and change with the times. As wrong-headed and defended and self-justifying as she is, she still deserves an 'A' for heroic effort. </p> <p><strong> Susan Sontag</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Born: </strong> 16 January 1933 </p> <p><strong> Educated:</strong> UC Berkeley, University of Chicago, Harvard </p> <p><strong> Family: </strong> Married Phillip Rieff (separated); one son, David </p> <p><strong> Latest novel: </strong> In America </p> <p><strong> Other novels:</strong> The Benefactor , Death Kit , The Volcano Lover </p> <p><strong> Other works:</strong> Illness as Metaphor , Aids and its Metaphors </p> <p><strong> Companion:</strong> Photographer Annie Leibowitz</p>",

Like supermarket trollies and mobile phones, cash machines are a necessary evil. </p> <p>The row that has engulfed them continued to escalate last week. The detail is devilishly complex, but because the machines are now so much a part of our lives, the outcome of the controversy could affect everyone. </p> <p>So, let me take you though it gently. </p> <p>Barclays started it all last year by deciding that it wanted to charge \u00a31 every time a non-customer used one of its machines. It paraded this as a great leap forward for consumers, because it would display the charge on machines, allowing people to walk away if they didn't want to pay. </p> <p>It would scrap charges previously levied on its own customers for using other banks' machines. But what Barclays had overlooked, or ignored, was that customers of many of its rivals would also be asked to pay 'disloyalty fees' when using Barclays machines. An Abbey National customer would pay \u00a32.50 to get cash out of a Barclays machine under the new arrangement. </p> <p>Nationwide building society, which levies no charges, threatened to take legal action against Barclays, and the bank shelved its plans. </p> <p>So why didn't it end there? </p> <p>When it comes to charges, banks don't give up. Barclays and the other banks that run the Link cash machine network decided to vote on whether surcharges of the type favoured by Barclays - and others too shy to own up to it - should be allowed. </p> <p>That vote took place last Tuesday, and most Link members backed surcharging, with no limit on the amount. </p> <p> <strong> But does it really cost \u00a31, much less \u00a32.50, to push some of my own cash through a hole in the wall?</strong> </p> <p> Don Cruickshank, the former telecommunications regulator who is investigating the banks for the Government, puts the real figure at no more than 30p, and as little as 15p. </p> <p>Late on Friday, a leaked report from the banks showed that the cost is no higher than 28p for a machine at a branch, and 40p at a supermarket. </p> <p>So at \u00a31 a time, a bank could make 70p. Using information given to us by Barclays, Cash calculated that this bank alone would profit by almost \u00a375 million a year from non-customers. </p> <p> <strong> Why do the banks think they can charge more?</strong> </p> <p> Even among bankers there was consternation at the public relations disaster Link members inflicted on themselves by seeming to defy Cruickshank. The fall-out stretched as far as the Prime Minister; the Government reacted with anger to the banks' decision last week, particularly the idea that people can be charged twice to use a machine. </p> <p>John Bridgeman, director general of Fair Trading, expressed his distaste. The Consumers' Association was outraged. </p> <p> <strong> So is this a rip-off too far?</strong> </p> <p> Certainly, if Cruickshank has his way. He has made it clear that the big four banks - Barclays, Lloyds TSB, HSBC and NatWest - risk fines for price collusion. </p> <p>The banks are now trying to limit the damage done by their decision. </p> <p>Barclays says its \u00a31 fee plan was just a 'stake in the ground', while Lloyds TSB told Trade Secretary Stephen Byers that Link should have put off a decision. </p> <p>Abbey National, which supports Barclays-style surcharges, says it will ensure that its customers don't face double charging, leading to fees of up to \u00a32.50. </p> <p> <strong> So is that the end of it?</strong> </p> <p> No. The banks still insist that it costs more than 30p to process a cash machine transaction. Byers has summoned them to a meeting to justify their position, and on Friday John Bridgeman warned that he would be watching for any evidence of price collusion. </p> <p>The most likely outcome is big compromises all round about the amount of the charge. </p> <p> <strong> So how do I protect myself?</strong> </p> <p> Check whether you are already paying charges to use the machines. Most big banks and Abbey National are taking up to \u00a31.50 a time for the use of ATMs not run by their own bank or one with which it has an agreement. </p> <p>You will probably have had a letter about this, and the fees appear on statements. </p> <p>The Link meeting did agree that all charges - whether from a customer's own bank, or the one running the machine being used - should be flashed on to the screen during the transaction. Previously, banks had claimed this was a technical impossibility. </p> <p> <strong> I know all about my banks' charges, and I go to machines I know are free. So why can't everyone else?</strong> </p> <p> You may want to change banks at some time in the future, perhaps to an Internet operator with no machines of its own. </p> <p>So it's in everyone's interests that the banks don't get away with daylight robbery at the hole in the wall. The banks are keen to squeeze these new upstart competitors which have no cash machine networks. </p> <p>You may move to a village with only one ATM, run by Barclays. </p> <p> <strong> So do any banks offer free access to their customers when using other cash machines?</strong> </p> <p> Barclays does this now, but do you really want to join a bank that seeks to charge other people \u00a31? Customers of the former TSB also get a free service. </p> <p>Among the other mainstream operators, Nationwide, Cooperative Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland do the same. </p> <p>In theory they could go on with the free service, and pay any future surcharges themselves. But they say they cannot afford to do so if the cost is as high as \u00a31 a time. </p> <p>However, even if surcharges become the norm, Nationwide and others may absorb some of the costs, and make low-cost access to ATMs a selling point for their current accounts. </p> <p> <strong> So, if the banks are so monopolistic in the way they run their machines, why can't someone else do it and offer a better deal?</strong> </p> <p> Cruickshank wants the network thrown open to competition, and Link agreed to this last week. It could be helpful in the long run.</p>",

Late on Friday, a leaked report from the banks showed that the cost is no higher than 28p for a machine at a branch, and 40p at a supermarket. So at \u00a31 a time, a bank could make 70p. Using information given to us by Barclays, Cash calculated that this bank alone would profit by almost \u00a375 million a year from non-customers. Why do the banks think they can charge more? Even among bankers there was consternation at the public relations disaster Link members inflicted on themselves by seeming to defy Cruickshank. The fall-out stretched as far as the Prime Minister; the Government reacted with anger to the banks' decision last week, particularly the idea that people can be charged twice to use a machine. John Bridgeman, director general of Fair Trading, expressed his distaste. The Consumers' Association was outraged. So is this a rip-off too far? Certainly, if Cruickshank has his way. He has made it clear that the big four banks - Barclays, Lloyds TSB, HSBC and NatWest - risk fines for price collusion. The banks are now trying to limit the damage done by their decision. Barclays says its \u00a31 fee plan was just a 'stake in the ground', while Lloyds TSB told Trade Secretary Stephen Byers that Link should have put off a decision. Abbey National, which supports Barclays-style surcharges, says it will ensure that its customers don't face double charging, leading to fees of up to \u00a32.50. So is that the end of it? No. The banks still insist that it costs more than 30p to process a cash machine transaction. Byers has summoned them to a meeting to justify their position, and on Friday John Bridgeman warned that he would be watching for any evidence of price collusion. The most likely outcome is big compromises all round about the amount of the charge. So how do I protect myself? Check whether you are already paying charges to use the machines. Most big banks and Abbey National are taking up to \u00a31.50 a time for the use of ATMs not run by their own bank or one with which it has an agreement. You will probably have had a letter about this, and the fees appear on statements. The Link meeting did agree that all charges - whether from a customer's own bank, or the one running the machine being used - should be flashed on to the screen during the transaction. Previously, banks had claimed this was a technical impossibility. I know all about my banks' charges, and I go to machines I know are free. So why can't everyone else? You may want to change banks at some time in the future, perhaps to an Internet operator with no machines of its own. So it's in everyone's interests that the banks don't get away with daylight robbery at the hole in the wall. The banks are keen to squeeze these new upstart competitors which have no cash machine networks. You may move to a village with only one ATM, run by Barclays. So do any banks offer free access to their customers when using other cash machines? Barclays does this now, but do you really want to join a bank that seeks to charge other people \u00a31? Customers of the former TSB also get a free service. Among the other mainstream operators, Nationwide, Cooperative Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland do the same. In theory they could go on with the free service, and pay any future surcharges themselves. But they say they cannot afford to do so if the cost is as high as \u00a31 a time. However, even if surcharges become the norm, Nationwide and others may absorb some of the costs, and make low-cost access to ATMs a selling point for their current accounts. So, if the banks are so monopolistic in the way they run their machines, why can't someone else do it and offer a better deal? Cruickshank wants the network thrown open to competition, and Link agreed to this last week. It could be helpful in the long run.",

The team made most of its gain by investing in AIM-listed technology company Infobank, spending \u00a3600 in January on shares that were worth \u00a313,000 by the end of the year. Investment clubs are groups of friends or colleagues who pool their resources to invest in the stock market. The Proshare Investment Club Manual (\u00a326.50 plus \u00a33 postage) gives detailed information on setting up and running a club. Proshare also publishes a simple introductory guide - A Way to Learn, A Way to Earn (\u00a35.99). Call 0171 394 5200 or visit www.proshare.org.uk Top-up reviews If you have bought a pension top-up scheme, known as a Free Standing Additional Voluntary Contribution Scheme (FSAVC) from an insurance company over the past few years when you could have joined your employer's top-up scheme, it may be worthwhile requesting a review of your case to see if the insurer mis-sold the policy. The Financial Services Authority has announced that insurers must contact people in three categories thought most likely to have been mis-sold an FSAVC between 29 April 1988 and 15 August 1999 and invite them to a review. Others can ask for a review. Investors who want their cases reviewed have until 30 June 2001 to apply. A leaflet on boosting pension provision is available from the FSA on 0800 917 3311. Annuity reform The requirement for new pensioners to buy annuities as soon as they cash in a personal pension or 'money purchase' company scheme should be reformed, according to a report published last week. The Retirement Income Working Party, headed by Oonagh McDonald, recommended that individuals should have freedom over how to invest their retirement funds, after first buying an index-linked annuity. Pensioners with large funds, \u00a3250,000 or more, can already delay purchase of an annuity, but low annuity rates are hitting those with smaller funds. Ronnie Lymburn of the Annuity Bureau said most people did not have funds large enough to benefit from the proposals. They would still be locked into buying an annuity. Policy on Fairplay People with criminal convictions who find it difficult to get insurance are being offered a new buildings and contents policy by Fairplay Insurance Services. The typical customer would be the businessperson who nevertheless has a minor conviction such as possession of cannabis. Tel: 01424 220110. Website: www.fairplayhelp.com",

But how would you feel about ending your closest personal relationship with an electronic transaction? </p> <p>A firm of solicitors in Stratford-upon-Avon, Woolley &amp; Co, has opened two virtual offices, in Solihull and Worcester, and is offering a do-it-yourself divorce package over the Internet. The web service is still being tested, but senior partner Andrew Woolley says it should be up and running within a month. </p> <p>The service costs \u00a399 including VAT, although court costs of \u00a3180 would be added to this. Woolley points out that the service simply ends a marriage legally and does not take account of proceedings such as arrangements for children or division of finances. </p> <p>The package includes divorce forms - either accessed on a CD or downloaded from the Internet - advice on how to complete them and an hour's telephone support. The forms are then sent to the court by post. 'If you want to save money and keep control of your own life and your own divorce, it's a good method,' Woolley says. </p> <p>The website, which is still under construction, is at <a href=\"http://www.e-lawfirm.co.uk\">www.e-lawfirm.co.uk</a> </p> <p>Woolley says he set up the service in response to demand, but admits that it would not suit everyone. 'For many people it's actually a very personal, private, sensitive and emotional issue. A lot of people want to sit in a private room with a solicitor.' </p> <p>Other lawyers believe that an Internet service is completely inappropriate. Liz Cowell, family partner at Pannone &amp; Partners in Manchester, says: 'My concern is that when people are in a highly emotional state, as they usually are during divorce proceedings, they are being faced with a machine rather than a person.' </p> <p>During a meeting with a solicitor, the client would get feedback, such as the suggestion that they get counselling before going ahead with the divorce, says Cowell. </p> <p>In any case, Internet divorce services are hardly cheaper than consulting a solicitor in the conventional way, she adds, and the high level of legal fees widely associated with divorce are not in fact for the divorce itself, but to cover the arrangements for children and money. 'The way to save money is not by using the Internet but by having mediation,' she says. </p> <p>The average firm of solicitors charges between \u00a3300 and \u00a3600 for a divorce. 'The deals on the Internet are not that much cheaper when you add them up,' she says. </p> <p>And some people are entitled to Legal Aid to cover their divorce costs. There is no Legal Aid available for undefended divorces, but help may be on offer for the cost of financial settlements or for making arrangements for the children. </p> <p>People on income support and some others do qualify for financial help from the Legal Aid board in uncontested divorces, although this is not strictly Legal Aid. </p> <p>Other critics say an Internet service may allow people to rush into a divorce, doing the whole thing online on the home computer in the aftermath of a row. </p> <p>But Woolley counters that it would be almost as easy to go to see a high street solicitor on the spur of the moment, and start proceedings that way. </p> <p>The Law Society says it recognises that the Internet and information technology will change the way that legal services are provided. 'We welcome any innovative new schemes that could increase access to legal advice for the public,' says Law Society President Robert Sayer. </p> <p>But he adds that there are many circumstances in which it is still better to consult a solicitor directly. 'In complicated proceedings such as a divorce where children or complex financial arrangements are involved, there is still no substitute for seeing a solicitor face to face.' </p> <p>However, it is inevitable that legal services, like many others, will increasingly be offered over the Internet. </p> <p>'Some legal services are based on the preparation of documents, and these are the ones which are easiest to offer via the Internet,' says Delia Venables, a lawyers' computer consultant. 'Uncontested divorces fall into this category, as do \"simple\" wills, changes of name, powers of attorney, simple leases for renting out a property and certain sorts of letters of complaint or claims for compensation.' </p> <p>Woolley says his firm intends to produce an Internet package similar to the divorce service, for clients who want to pursue debtors. </p> <p>There is already a wealth of information on legal issues available on the Net: some firms of solicitors offer free initial advice on topics such as wills, tax and personal finances. Venables maintains a web site providing links to free legal information for the public at <a href=\"http://www.venables.co.uk\">www.venables.co.uk</a>. </p> <p>One company, called Desktop Lawyer - which is not a firm of solicitors - provides documents for a variety of legal uses through its website at <a href=\"http://www.desktoplawyer.net\">www.desktoplawyer.net</a> and through Internet service providers such as Freeserve and Lineone. </p> <p>Anyone using them is advised to be extremely careful, however, particularly as many of the legal services available on the Internet are offered by companies other than solicitors. </p> <p>'If in doubt go to a solicitor,' says Venables. 'If the document you get over the Internet is incorrect in some way, the consequences could be very serious.'</p>",

'The deals on the Internet are not that much cheaper when you add them up,' she says. And some people are entitled to Legal Aid to cover their divorce costs. There is no Legal Aid available for undefended divorces, but help may be on offer for the cost of financial settlements or for making arrangements for the children. People on income support and some others do qualify for financial help from the Legal Aid board in uncontested divorces, although this is not strictly Legal Aid. Other critics say an Internet service may allow people to rush into a divorce, doing the whole thing online on the home computer in the aftermath of a row. But Woolley counters that it would be almost as easy to go to see a high street solicitor on the spur of the moment, and start proceedings that way. The Law Society says it recognises that the Internet and information technology will change the way that legal services are provided. 'We welcome any innovative new schemes that could increase access to legal advice for the public,' says Law Society President Robert Sayer. But he adds that there are many circumstances in which it is still better to consult a solicitor directly. 'In complicated proceedings such as a divorce where children or complex financial arrangements are involved, there is still no substitute for seeing a solicitor face to face.' However, it is inevitable that legal services, like many others, will increasingly be offered over the Internet. 'Some legal services are based on the preparation of documents, and these are the ones which are easiest to offer via the Internet,' says Delia Venables, a lawyers' computer consultant. 'Uncontested divorces fall into this category, as do \"simple\" wills, changes of name, powers of attorney, simple leases for renting out a property and certain sorts of letters of complaint or claims for compensation.' Woolley says his firm intends to produce an Internet package similar to the divorce service, for clients who want to pursue debtors. There is already a wealth of information on legal issues available on the Net: some firms of solicitors offer free initial advice on topics such as wills, tax and personal finances. Venables maintains a web site providing links to free legal information for the public at www.venables.co.uk. One company, called Desktop Lawyer - which is not a firm of solicitors - provides documents for a variety of legal uses through its website at www.desktoplawyer.net and through Internet service providers such as Freeserve and Lineone. Anyone using them is advised to be extremely careful, however, particularly as many of the legal services available on the Internet are offered by companies other than solicitors. 'If in doubt go to a solicitor,' says Venables. 'If the document you get over the Internet is incorrect in some way, the consequences could be very serious.'",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>They were once called medals, then 'art medals' and now 'hand-held sculpture'. Which is what they have become. </p> <p>It was in eastern Europe in the Seventies - in Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria - that medal makers broke the mould of the dull disc-with-ribbon. Bored with casting officially commissioned medals bearing portraits of worthies, they began making pocket-sized sculptures that were politically or sexually subversive - or which innocently celebrated weddings and christenings. </p> <p>British medal makers and sculptors have followed their lead. Among the unusual shapes being bought by collectors in the UK are: a tiny squashed Coke can, a hinged human brain with male and female genitalia inside that slot together, a slice of cake with a filling of a loving couple on one side and writhing maggots on the other, and a low-relief of a wheatsheaf that is a coded mockery of Strathclyde council. </p> <p>Most contemporary art medals cost less than \u00a3100. You can view the British Museum's exhibition of 78 of them, mostly in bronze, from its own collection, then stroll down the road to the Simmons Gallery, the first gallery to specialise in medals, and buy medals from some of the editions that are in the museum's collection. Simmons is also offering a choice of 130 British and East European medals from this year's British Art Medal Society Student Medal Project, an international competition. In May, an exhibition of art medals, mostly in precious metals, opens at Goldsmiths' Hall in east London. </p> <p>Among established artists in Britain who have made art medals are Damien Hirst, Henry Moore, Elizabeth Frink, Lynn Chadwick, Dhruva Mistry, Ian Hamilton Finlay (whose studio was raided by Strathclyde council) and cartoonist Ronald Searle. </p> <p>A Chadwick medal of 1984, from one of the six editions offered annually to members of the British Art Medal Society (BAMS), which is based at the British Museum, sold for \u00a3800 at a Christie's sculpture auction a few years ago. BAMS members had bought 128 at \u00a325 each. Ian Hamilton Finlay's BAMS medal of the same year sold only 43 at the same price and would retail at \u00a3225 - if any could be found. </p> <p>Whether art medals turn out to be good investments depends largely on whether potential collectors continue to be put off by the word 'medal'. Luke Syson, curator of medals at the British Museum, made sure to omit the 'm' word from the exhibition title. It is called 'Size immaterial: hand-held sculpture of the 1990s'. A visitor to the exhibition, in the museum's coins and medals department, was heard to mutter: 'What are these things doing here?' </p> <p>The museum's collection was only a year old when Syson joined the staff and in the nine years since then he has put together almost all of it. He says: 'Classifying art medals as sculpture is one way of rescuing them from being ghettoised as some side-alley of the applied arts. They are small, but enormous artistically. The weight of them in the hand, the way they feel, is part of their emotional impact and appeal.' </p> <p>Nevertheless, much of their wittiness derives from the way they ape the conventions of traditional medal design. For instance, most of the sculptures are still double-sided - literally, two-faced - giving ample opportunity for juxtapositions satirising the social respectability, military might or civic pride medals once commemorated. </p> <p>The unification of East and West Germany has been a rich source of double-sided medallic lampoons. The museum's collection contains the German Carsten Theumer's medal inscribed 'Ex occidente felicitas' (Happiness from the West), showing on one side a God-like hand offering a banana, and on the other a bony, naked East German, with bananas stuffed into every orifice, clutching a soft drink. </p> <p>The exhibit that most resembles a traditional coin or medal is one of the most subversive. It bears a portrait of the gay film director Derek Jarman, encircled by his name and date of death, 1991, in respectable Roman-style lettering. Its British sculptor, Ian Rank-Broadley, is used to sculpting queens; Queen Elizabeth's current portrait on British currency is by him. Syson says: 'The medal questions who the great and the good really are by thrusting an outsider into their ranks.' </p> <p>Rank-Broadley is one of Britain's finest portrait sculptors and a bit of a character. He was once escorted out of the Royal Mint by a security guard after telling the Mint's deputy master that his output of coins and medals was rubbish aesthetically. </p> <p>American Richard Tuttle's exhibit is a wooden box marked MEDALS in bold black capitals, which opens to reveal four blobs in aluminium, copper, silver and gold, all bearing the imprints of man's fingers or tools.

      "bodyText": "They were once called medals, then 'art medals' and now 'hand-held sculpture'. Which is what they have become. It was in eastern Europe in the Seventies - in Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria - that medal makers broke the mould of the dull disc-with-ribbon. Bored with casting officially commissioned medals bearing portraits of worthies, they began making pocket-sized sculptures that were politically or sexually subversive - or which innocently celebrated weddings and christenings. British medal makers and sculptors have followed their lead. Among the unusual shapes being bought by collectors in the UK are: a tiny squashed Coke can, a hinged human brain with male and female genitalia inside that slot together, a slice of cake with a filling of a loving couple on one side and writhing maggots on the other, and a low-relief of a wheatsheaf that is a coded mockery of Strathclyde council. Most contemporary art medals cost less than \u00a3100. You can view the British Museum's exhibition of 78 of them, mostly in bronze, from its own collection, then stroll down the road to the Simmons Gallery, the first gallery to specialise in medals, and buy medals from some of the editions that are in the museum's collection. Simmons is also offering a choice of 130 British and East European medals from this year's British Art Medal Society Student Medal Project, an international competition. In May, an exhibition of art medals, mostly in precious metals, opens at Goldsmiths' Hall in east London. Among established artists in Britain who have made art medals are Damien Hirst, Henry Moore, Elizabeth Frink, Lynn Chadwick, Dhruva Mistry, Ian Hamilton Finlay (whose studio was raided by Strathclyde council) and cartoonist Ronald Searle. A Chadwick medal of 1984, from one of the six editions offered annually to members of the British Art Medal Society (BAMS), which is based at the British Museum, sold for \u00a3800 at a Christie's sculpture auction a few years ago. BAMS members had bought 128 at \u00a325 each. Ian Hamilton Finlay's BAMS medal of the same year sold only 43 at the same price and would retail at \u00a3225 - if any could be found. Whether art medals turn out to be good investments depends largely on whether potential collectors continue to be put off by the word 'medal'. Luke Syson, curator of medals at the British Museum, made sure to omit the 'm' word from the exhibition title. It is called 'Size immaterial: hand-held sculpture of the 1990s'. A visitor to the exhibition, in the museum's coins and medals department, was heard to mutter: 'What are these things doing here?' The museum's collection was only a year old when Syson joined the staff and in the nine years since then he has put together almost all of it. He says: 'Classifying art medals as sculpture is one way of rescuing them from being ghettoised as some side-alley of the applied arts. They are small, but enormous artistically. The weight of them in the hand, the way they feel, is part of their emotional impact and appeal.' Nevertheless, much of their wittiness derives from the way they ape the conventions of traditional medal design. For instance, most of the sculptures are still double-sided - literally, two-faced - giving ample opportunity for juxtapositions satirising the social respectability, military might or civic pride medals once commemorated. The unification of East and West Germany has been a rich source of double-sided medallic lampoons. The museum's collection contains the German Carsten Theumer's medal inscribed 'Ex occidente felicitas' (Happiness from the West), showing on one side a God-like hand offering a banana, and on the other a bony, naked East German, with bananas stuffed into every orifice, clutching a soft drink. The exhibit that most resembles a traditional coin or medal is one of the most subversive. It bears a portrait of the gay film director Derek Jarman, encircled by his name and date of death, 1991, in respectable Roman-style lettering. Its British sculptor, Ian Rank-Broadley, is used to sculpting queens; Queen Elizabeth's current portrait on British currency is by him. Syson says: 'The medal questions who the great and the good really are by thrusting an outsider into their ranks.' Rank-Broadley is one of Britain's finest portrait sculptors and a bit of a character. He was once escorted out of the Royal Mint by a security guard after telling the Mint's deputy master that his output of coins and medals was rubbish aesthetically. American Richard Tuttle's exhibit is a wooden box marked MEDALS in bold black capitals, which opens to reveal four blobs in aluminium, copper, silver and gold, all bearing the imprints of man's fingers or tools. Work that one out. The most unrecognisable medal is not Damien Hirst's screenprint dots on perspex but the Dutch Mirjam Mieras's 'South Pole', an alabaster disc with a delicate snowy surface bearing an account of Scott's tragic 1911 expedition. It must be handled with a pair of white gloves, and is concealed in two felt pouches at the dark end of a sleeve-length silk bag. You have to journey into the unknown to reach it.

      "body": "<p>Some of the best known fund managers have made losses for investors in UK equity income funds over the past year. And when the sector produced an average return of only 5.1 per cent in the year to 1 February, investors are justified in asking questions. </p> <p>Investors may wonder why they have done so badly when, by contrast, the UK All Companies performance category averaged an 18.1 per cent total return over the year. </p> <p>Within the equity income sector, performance varied a lot. The top fund was ABN Amro Equity Income, which produced a 58.7 per cent return for investors. Clearly, funds like this can produce the goods even when markets are against them. </p> <p>Equity income funds have an impressive history. They aim to give an income which, though it may not be high initially, should grow over a number of years. The funds seek to provide capital growth - and evidence shows they have achieved this. </p> <p>An investor buying \u00a31,000 of units in Jupiter Income, the sector's top 10-year performer, at the 1989 high of 109p, would have got \u00a332 in income in the first year. In 1999 the same investment, if left untouched, would have given income of \u00a31,250 (or 12.5 per cent on the initial investment) and the holding would have been worth \u00a33,471. </p> <p>The strategy income funds have used for achieving high total returns (returns made up of income and growth) is to buy undervalued stocks with relatively high yields. </p> <p>The stock is held until the share price goes up, reducing the yield. It is then sold, and replaced with cheaper stocks which have higher yields. Income funds have therefore had a continuous discipline for buying cheap and selling dear - a successful recipe for growth as well as yield. </p> <p>In the past year or so this strategy has failed to deliver the goods, because the big performers in the market have been companies with low or no yield but enormous growth prospects. Higher-yielding companies in traditional sectors have seen very little share price growth. This is why funds still run according to a traditional strategy have been so disappointing. Equity income funds have let investors down by focusing too much on income and not enough on growth, says Norwich Union's Scott McKenzie. </p> <p>Some managers have sought to adapt to the changing market by adopting a new strategy. Last October McKenzie, formerly of Britannic, became manager of Norwich UK Equity Income trust, which is sixth in the sector with 13.8 per cent growth over one year. He set about restructuring the trust. </p> <p>The yield was reduced to remove its reliance on out-of-favour high-yielding stocks and to provide a new base for steady income growth. A number of more fashionable technology stocks were added to the portfolio. </p> <p>Some of these stocks pay no dividend - an extreme approach for an income fund, admits McKenzie - but they are balanced by high-yielding stocks with low valuations, such as Halifax and Scottish Power, which will provide a yield and the possibility of future dividend growth. A 10 per cent exposure to convertibles further boosts yield. </p> <p>Dividend yields in the equity income sector are usually low compared with deposit returns: they currently average 3.2 per cent. The attraction of such funds is their ability to keep pace with inflation in both income and capital terms. They are not for the immediate high income seeker who wants no risk to capital. Investors who are risk averse and want a high income should look at corporate bonds, says Scott McKenzie. </p> <p>George Luckraft, manager of the top-performing ABN Amro fund, also holds a combination of traditional income stocks plus growth stocks. If you hold traditional stocks, you are guaranteed losses at the moment, he says. </p> <p>He also feels that stocks that have been the staple fodder of income funds will have fundamental problems in future. As businesses, they will find it harder to increase the prices they charge their consumers because of downward price pressure of increasing competition - much of it due to the Internet. They will therefore have great difficulties increasing their dividend payouts. Such stocks will see falling share prices raising dividend yields to double figures. They will be like junk bonds, with fixed payments and no scope for growth, says Luckraft. </p> <p>Some stocks have already reached this situation. He points to five or six motor dealers with yields of 10 per cent or more. However, traditional stocks have further to fall before a turnaround comes, in Luckraft's view. </p> <p>Is the new approach of funds such as Norwich Union and ABN Amro a permanent change or a temporary strategy? The traditional business model is seriously threatened by new-economy stocks. Companies have to get used to lower long-term margins. In that sense, Luckraft says, the change is permanent. </p> <p>Rumours of the death of the income fund may be greatly exaggerated. </p> <p>'If someone says \"this is the death\" of something, that is the time to buy,' says Kean Seager of Bristol investment adviser Whitechurch Securities. His colleague Warren Perry likes the ABN Amro and Norwich Union funds, plus Gartmore UK Growth and Income, which has also maintained growth through investment in technology. </p> <p>'The winners of tomorrow are the funds that invest on a total return basis, and I regard these three to be among the best,' says Perry.</p>",

Equity income funds have let investors down by focusing too much on income and not enough on growth, says Norwich Union's Scott McKenzie. Some managers have sought to adapt to the changing market by adopting a new strategy. Last October McKenzie, formerly of Britannic, became manager of Norwich UK Equity Income trust, which is sixth in the sector with 13.8 per cent growth over one year. He set about restructuring the trust. The yield was reduced to remove its reliance on out-of-favour high-yielding stocks and to provide a new base for steady income growth. A number of more fashionable technology stocks were added to the portfolio. Some of these stocks pay no dividend - an extreme approach for an income fund, admits McKenzie - but they are balanced by high-yielding stocks with low valuations, such as Halifax and Scottish Power, which will provide a yield and the possibility of future dividend growth. A 10 per cent exposure to convertibles further boosts yield. Dividend yields in the equity income sector are usually low compared with deposit returns: they currently average 3.2 per cent. The attraction of such funds is their ability to keep pace with inflation in both income and capital terms. They are not for the immediate high income seeker who wants no risk to capital. Investors who are risk averse and want a high income should look at corporate bonds, says Scott McKenzie. George Luckraft, manager of the top-performing ABN Amro fund, also holds a combination of traditional income stocks plus growth stocks. If you hold traditional stocks, you are guaranteed losses at the moment, he says. He also feels that stocks that have been the staple fodder of income funds will have fundamental problems in future. As businesses, they will find it harder to increase the prices they charge their consumers because of downward price pressure of increasing competition - much of it due to the Internet. They will therefore have great difficulties increasing their dividend payouts. Such stocks will see falling share prices raising dividend yields to double figures. They will be like junk bonds, with fixed payments and no scope for growth, says Luckraft. Some stocks have already reached this situation. He points to five or six motor dealers with yields of 10 per cent or more. However, traditional stocks have further to fall before a turnaround comes, in Luckraft's view. Is the new approach of funds such as Norwich Union and ABN Amro a permanent change or a temporary strategy? The traditional business model is seriously threatened by new-economy stocks. Companies have to get used to lower long-term margins. In that sense, Luckraft says, the change is permanent. Rumours of the death of the income fund may be greatly exaggerated. 'If someone says \"this is the death\" of something, that is the time to buy,' says Kean Seager of Bristol investment adviser Whitechurch Securities. His colleague Warren Perry likes the ABN Amro and Norwich Union funds, plus Gartmore UK Growth and Income, which has also maintained growth through investment in technology. 'The winners of tomorrow are the funds that invest on a total return basis, and I regard these three to be among the best,' says Perry.",

In what looked like a spat for an unexciting telephone company, Murdoch found himself pitted against the same dynasty which sold him Star TV - the powerful Li family. This time he was not dealing with Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's most powerful tycoon, but with his son Richard Li, the 33-year-old dynamo who is proving to be a worthy business successor to his father. </p> <p>The prize in this fight was Hong Kong Telecom, a subsidiary of the UK's Cable &amp; Wireless company. Li junior, against all the odds, made a successful \u00a322.5 billion offer for HKT, beating Singapore Telecom which had been backed at the eleventh hour by $1 billion of Rupert Murdoch's money. </p> <p>On the face of it, Li's newborn Pacific Century CyberWorks (PCCW) was not in the same league as rival Singapore Telecom (SingTel) in the struggle for HKT. Politely described as a 'highflying Internet concept stock', PCCW has no subscribers and no proven track record - and it was less than a year old. </p> <p>But the cards on the table in the world of Hong Kong big-dealing are never quite what they seem, and Li had several hidden aces. </p> <p>Paradoxically, the one ace in the open - the strength of the Li name - is the one most vigorously denied. Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's former 'plastic flower king' who made a fortune and stormed the British hongs, has nothing to do with the HKT affair, insist executives at PCCW and at his Cheung Kong (Holdings). </p> <p>Liu Jinbao, general manager of the Bank of China in Hong Kong, tells a different story, saying that Li Ka-shing asked the Bank to support the PCCW bid 'on a number of occasions'. </p> <p>So what about the China card? The Bank of China has joined a four-bank consortium putting up a mammoth US$13bn bridge loan to PCCW, without which the deal would never have gone through. And the speed with which the loan was arranged knocked the socks off C&amp;W's UK-based management. </p> <p>Richard Li denies that a trip to Beijing last month had anything to do with raising funds, saying the suggestion is just 'bull'. </p> <p>Hong Kong's chief secretary, Anson Chan, leapt to deny the suggestion that Beijing had leant on her government to keep HKT in local hands. 'On this occasion,' she said, 'we have not received any direction ... nor any intervention from the central government.' But locally, there is little doubt this was seen as a victory for Hong Kong Chinese business against their rival, Singapore. </p> <p>Richard Li says he wants to reach out to Asia's millions who have TV sets but no telephones, delivering an interactive digital service via satellite and local cable which will link them to the Web. HKT, with its near-total fixed line coverage of Hong Kong, offers a test bed for broadband delivery - via the telephone line rather than by satellite - to millions of TVs. </p> <p>It is this aspect which caused Murdoch some anxiety and points to why he made his late intervention. True, Murdoch's banking adviser Goldman Sachs was also adviser to the SingTel bid for HKT, but the last thing Murdoch wants is a war at the gate of the potentially most lucrative market in the world with the favoured local boy.

James now has to pick the bones out of potential conflicts with his contemporary, Li.

      "bodyText": "When Rupert Murdoch snatched Star TV in an audacious $850 million deal in 1993 his Far Eastern prospects were very much on the rise. His News Corp stormtroopers had snuck in and 'stolen' the company from a rival bidder, the languid British media company Pearson. But, after a week of shocking wheeler-dealing in the Far East, the question remains whether Murdoch's Far Eastern promise is turning into a busted flush. In what looked like a spat for an unexciting telephone company, Murdoch found himself pitted against the same dynasty which sold him Star TV - the powerful Li family. This time he was not dealing with Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's most powerful tycoon, but with his son Richard Li, the 33-year-old dynamo who is proving to be a worthy business successor to his father. The prize in this fight was Hong Kong Telecom, a subsidiary of the UK's Cable &amp; Wireless company.

On the face of it, Li's newborn Pacific Century CyberWorks (PCCW) was not in the same league as rival Singapore Telecom (SingTel) in the struggle for HKT. Politely described as a 'highflying Internet concept stock', PCCW has no subscribers and no proven track record - and it was less than a year old. But the cards on the table in the world of Hong Kong big-dealing are never quite what they seem, and Li had several hidden aces. Paradoxically, the one ace in the open - the strength of the Li name - is the one most vigorously denied. Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong's former 'plastic flower king' who made a fortune and stormed the British hongs, has nothing to do with the HKT affair, insist executives at PCCW and at his Cheung Kong (Holdings).

That was the last date for registered owners to be entitled to the dividend. I was the registered owner with Dealwise on that date, but they refuse to pay me the dividend. <strong><br> WJ, Butleigh </strong></p> <p>Unfortunately, the Debenhams shares actually went ex-dividend on Monday 29 November, so whoever bought shares that day bought them without the right to receive the next dividend.

I did not receive acknowledgment, but got a statement showing no money was due. Later in the year, I received several invitations to borrow money from Barclaycard, which I destroyed, and an invitation to take a gold card, which I also destroyed. In December, a gold card arrived unsolicited. I made repeated attempts to telephone and cancel it, but without success. I then sent a letter by recorded delivery telling them not to dispatch a PIN and asked for an apology and compensation for the money I had wasted on postage and phone calls. I did not receive a reply, and the PIN arrived. Now, what I believe to be a chequebook has arrived from Barclaycard. I am a retired medical secretary aged 69 and, if they knew what my income was, they would not trust me with a credit card.

      "body": "<p>The vote at London's Regents Park Hotel yesterday was a result Senator John McCain could only dream of. Members of Co-operative Retail Services overwhelmingly backed a merger with the Co-operative Wholesale Society, sealing a long-cherished ambition to revitalise one of the country's best loved high street names. </p> <p>With the deal in the bag, the new Co-op force is already looking towards the total unification of the movement founded by the Rochdale pioneers 150 years ago. Ten days ago, Tony Blair sponsored the foundation of a new commission of the great and the good in the Labour Party and trade unions to look at the whole future of the Co-op. New legislation, freeing the venerable institution to compete better with the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury, is already one certain outcome. And after 50 years of mergers of small co-ops up and down the land, United Norwest - the last big independent - faces intense pressure to join the fold. </p> <p>'The merger of CWS and CRS will transform the movement in one fell swoop,' Graham Melmoth, CWS's seasoned chief executive, said this weekend. 'The co-op sector has to perform as effectively as the big four retailers to survive. We are now creating the conditions to do this.' </p> <p>The developments were not borne only of fear of the co-op's giant rivals. Three years ago, borrowing tactics from the dirtiest of stock market takeover battles, Melmoth saw off carpetbaggers led by City whiz kid Andrew Regan who wanted to plunder the co-op as building societies have been pillaged for windfalls before. The battle - featuring a Serious Fraud Office pursuit of traitors in the ranks - was won decisively, but the war was far from over. As The Observer disclosed last May, new get-rich-quick-merchants in the City attempted to recruit top Co-op names to front a fresh bid for the CWS and its prize assets, which include the Co-op Bank, the Co-op Insurance Society and Britain's biggest farmer and funeral arranger. </p> <p>And, as we can reveal today, there was intense concern among senior 'co-operators' about New Labour's interest in the movement at all. Nicolas Lethbridge, the financier putting together the new bid, was thought to have an inside track to Downing Street. His partner, Margaret McCabe, is a barrister who knows Cherie Blair. </p> <p>One co-op adviser said: 'We don't spend all our time looking over a shoulder. But there was a worry that the Prime Minister's benign interest in the Co-op might vanish in the name of so-called modernisation.' </p> <p>From conversations last June between Melmoth and the then Labour Party finance director, David Pitt-Watson, plus subsequent meetings at the No 10 Policy Unit attended by Phil Wilson, Blair's aide from his Sedgefield constituency, the Co-op Commission was born. </p> <p>In parallel, Melmoth reactivated talks with the CRS. Previous ones had foundered on personality clashes with Harry Moore, the CRS's long-standing chief executive, over who would head a merged organisation. By last summer, however, Moore had gone, replaced by Andy Meehan, a senior executive of Storehouse, the BhS and Mothercare chain, who was charged with completing a fundamental reorganisation. More importantly, heavy losses had driven the CRS into financial trouble which had led to the \u00a3150 million sale of its non-food stores to cut debt. Yesterday's decision means the CWS is again fulfilling its role as saviour of last resort for failing Co-ops around the country. </p> <p>One CWS director said: 'The merger had to happen.

      "bodyText": "The vote at London's Regents Park Hotel yesterday was a result Senator John McCain could only dream of. Members of Co-operative Retail Services overwhelmingly backed a merger with the Co-operative Wholesale Society, sealing a long-cherished ambition to revitalise one of the country's best loved high street names. With the deal in the bag, the new Co-op force is already looking towards the total unification of the movement founded by the Rochdale pioneers 150 years ago. Ten days ago, Tony Blair sponsored the foundation of a new commission of the great and the good in the Labour Party and trade unions to look at the whole future of the Co-op. New legislation, freeing the venerable institution to compete better with the likes of Tesco and Sainsbury, is already one certain outcome. And after 50 years of mergers of small co-ops up and down the land, United Norwest - the last big independent - faces intense pressure to join the fold. 'The merger of CWS and CRS will transform the movement in one fell swoop,' Graham Melmoth, CWS's seasoned chief executive, said this weekend. 'The co-op sector has to perform as effectively as the big four retailers to survive. We are now creating the conditions to do this.' The developments were not borne only of fear of the co-op's giant rivals. Three years ago, borrowing tactics from the dirtiest of stock market takeover battles, Melmoth saw off carpetbaggers led by City whiz kid Andrew Regan who wanted to plunder the co-op as building societies have been pillaged for windfalls before. The battle - featuring a Serious Fraud Office pursuit of traitors in the ranks - was won decisively, but the war was far from over. As The Observer disclosed last May, new get-rich-quick-merchants in the City attempted to recruit top Co-op names to front a fresh bid for the CWS and its prize assets, which include the Co-op Bank, the Co-op Insurance Society and Britain's biggest farmer and funeral arranger. And, as we can reveal today, there was intense concern among senior 'co-operators' about New Labour's interest in the movement at all. Nicolas Lethbridge, the financier putting together the new bid, was thought to have an inside track to Downing Street. His partner, Margaret McCabe, is a barrister who knows Cherie Blair. One co-op adviser said: 'We don't spend all our time looking over a shoulder. But there was a worry that the Prime Minister's benign interest in the Co-op might vanish in the name of so-called modernisation.' From conversations last June between Melmoth and the then Labour Party finance director, David Pitt-Watson, plus subsequent meetings at the No 10 Policy Unit attended by Phil Wilson, Blair's aide from his Sedgefield constituency, the Co-op Commission was born. In parallel, Melmoth reactivated talks with the CRS. Previous ones had foundered on personality clashes with Harry Moore, the CRS's long-standing chief executive, over who would head a merged organisation. By last summer, however, Moore had gone, replaced by Andy Meehan, a senior executive of Storehouse, the BhS and Mothercare chain, who was charged with completing a fundamental reorganisation. More importantly, heavy losses had driven the CRS into financial trouble which had led to the \u00a3150 million sale of its non-food stores to cut debt. Yesterday's decision means the CWS is again fulfilling its role as saviour of last resort for failing Co-ops around the country. One CWS director said: 'The merger had to happen. Otherwise Co-op assets would simply have been sold off to the highest bidder - assets built up by members over a century and a half.' The Co-op hopes that the commission, chaired by TUC general secretary John Monks, will give the movement fresh impetus. In particular, senior figures want new legislation that will revamp Co-op boards along commercial lines, with clear accountability to members and let in experienced non-executive directors from outside. Management and staff are likely to be rewarded with new incentives, possibly new, income-bearing shares. And, as with building societies, directors want the threshold for conversion to company status to be raised from a bare majority to 75 per cent to deter carpetbaggers. Instead of conversion, with building society-style windfalls, the movement hopes to define the 'Co-op difference' with new dividends for customer loyalty and clear objectives for funding social projects in local communities. To achieve those ambitions, however, the Co-op must survive and become as efficient as its rivals in a fiercely competitive market. Last year, the CWS made operating profits of \u00a3113m on sales of \u00a33.2 billion. And for the first time in 22 years, its 640 supermarkets and convenience stores increased their market share. That compares well with CRS, which runs 470 shops and made operating losses of \u00a329m on sales of \u00a31.3bn.

You keep a customer for life: they'll start off buying a Mini and work up through the range.' There are 350 Rover and Land Rover dealers in the UK and 165 BMW outlets.",

      "body": "<p>The city is clearly trying to get a message across to Sir Clive Thompson, chief executive of pest control-to-pot plant group Rentokil Initial. A year ago, he insisted he would not abandon his target of 20 per cent annual profits growth, although it was becoming obvious that Rentokil could not achieve it. Since then, the shares have lost two-thirds of their value. </p> <p>Last week, he set new targets - sales growth of 6-10 per cent, producing profits growth of 8-14 per cent, and outperforming the support services sector over the next five years - and the shares fell by more than a fifth. </p> <p>The problem is not the targets per se - although 10 per cent sales growth is paltry compared with what technology companies claim they can achieve - but whether Rentokil can achieve them. Last year's results produced plenty of disappointments, starting with the profits themselves. </p> <p>On the face of it, a 10 per cent increase in profit to \u00a3541 million was comfortably within analysts' expectations. But an examination of the small print showed that that was after the writeback of a \u00a317.6m provision; without that, profits would have grown by a much more pedestrian 6.3 per cent. </p> <p>Then there was the disposals programme. The City had been expecting sales of non-core businesses to raise between \u00a3700m and \u00a31 billion, and hoped for news of at least one big sale with the results. Now, Rentokil is estimating between \u00a3600m and \u00a3700m, and promises the sales will be completed by the year end. If the price achieved is at the lower end, that would hit profits by a swingeing 12.6 per cent. </p> <p>The \u00a31.5bn share buy-back confirmed last week will compensate - assuming the share price does not rise too much before it is carried out. But that news was overshadowed by the planned acquisition of Ratin, the Danish investment company whose sole asset is 32 per cent of Rentokil's shares. Thompson says the move will improve liquidity, and pre-empts Ratin's decision to distribute the shares next spring. But investors are concerned that the 19,000 Danish shareholders who will turn up on its register will offload their shares. </p> <p>Thompson admits that the new targets are achievable in the 'medium term'. On the basis of last year's figures, even that looks ambitious. Stripping out the businesses to be sold, sales grew by just 3.4 per cent. True, profits were 10.5 per cent higher, but there must be a question over how long Rentokil can continue increasing margins. </p> <p>It could, of course, fall back on acquisitions. Its cashflow remains enviably strong and, even after the buy-back, it could comfortably afford to spend \u00a31bn. </p> <p>But Rentokil's problems stem partly from its reliance on acquisitions to meet its old 20 per cent target. It needs to convince investors that it has changed. On a rating of 11 times forecast earnings, its shares look cheap, but there is a lot better value elsewhere. </p> <p><strong> Get a stake in L&amp;G</strong><br> David Prosser, chief executive of Legal &amp; General, sees no need for a merger of the kind proposed by Norwich Union and CGU: they have an eye to the global market, while L&amp;G sees plenty of opportunities in the UK. </p> <p>Last year's results suggest he is right, so far. New business grew by 27 per cent, exceeding \u00a3500m in the UK for the first time; operating profit before tax rose 12 per cent and the dividend is increased by a generous 14 per cent. If Prosser is right about the potential in stakeholder pensions, there should be much more to come. </p> <p>L&amp;G has already invested considerable resources in preparing for stakeholder pensions. Its focus will be on deals through the workplace and affinity groups, such as the Computer Services and Software Association, with which it has just formed an alliance. Prosser thinks the market could be worth as much as \u00a320bn in the first three years and hopes L&amp;G can take as much as 10 per cent of that market, double its share of other investment products. It is building on its Internet capability, already used by independent advisers and its own salesmen, both to cut the costs and make it easy for stakeholders to monitor their pensions. </p> <p>L&amp;G has an enviable record of increasing market share by offering good value products that people want to buy. That has helped it treble its new business in the past five years. If anyone can make a success of stakeholder pensions, it can. The shares have been under a cloud since the collapse of its proposed merger with NatWest but they deserve a re-rating. Buy. </p> <p><strong> Techno wizardry</strong><br> Private shareholders are constantly being told not even to consider investing in technology shares on their own, but to spread their risk by buying a technology fund. That is sound advice: even the professionals do not know which of the new breed of companies will prosper, so what hope have retail investors? </p> <p>The problem is that even the technology funds are now starting to look expensive. The price of unit trusts reflects the value of the underlying investments but, as even the most bullish techno-buff will tell you, many of these will prove hopelessly optimistic. Demand for technology investment trusts is so great that many are standing at above their net asset value. There is, therefore, a risk that anyone buying now will end up losing money. </p> <p>One way round this is to look for trusts with significant technology exposure but which, perhaps because they do not have technology in their titles, have not been caught up in the boom. </p> <p>The price of trusts such as Dresdner RCM Smaller Companies, Henderson Smaller Companies and Discovery Trust - run by Friends Ivory &amp; Sime - stands at 15 per cent or more below their asset values.

Then, most single men in their thirties were either gay or divorced. Either way, they would have plenty of emotional and financial baggage. </p> <p>In fact David is one of an increasing number of men and women who have postponed getting married and having a family. His work as a civil engineer has led to him spending long periods overseas - he has lived in Africa, the Far East, the Middle East and the US. Although he has now returned to Britain, David's \u00a333,000 salary means he can still travel widely for pleasure and enjoy a healthy social life that keeps him out most nights. And while he has had relationships during the past 15 years, he has not felt the need to settle down. </p> <p>'I'm not sure I actively decided to postpone getting married - it is just the way it has ended up,' he says.

      "bodyText": "David is 36, tall, dark, attractive - and single. Ten years ago people might have regarded his unmarried status with a certain amount of suspicion. Then, most single men in their thirties were either gay or divorced. Either way, they would have plenty of emotional and financial baggage. In fact David is one of an increasing number of men and women who have postponed getting married and having a family. His work as a civil engineer has led to him spending long periods overseas - he has lived in Africa, the Far East, the Middle East and the US. Although he has now returned to Britain, David's \u00a333,000 salary means he can still travel widely for pleasure and enjoy a healthy social life that keeps him out most nights. And while he has had relationships during the past 15 years, he has not felt the need to settle down. 'I'm not sure I actively decided to postpone getting married - it is just the way it has ended up,' he says. 'I have never met the right person. I hope I will get married and possibly have a family in the future.' David is a classic 'sorted': single, own residence, thirtysomething, employed deferrer - an independent, financially comfortable adult who continually puts off major lifestyle decisions, says Martin Hayward, director of consumer consultancy at the Henley Centre.

You are likely to get a much better deal by going to a specialist who understands the risks of living in a thatched property. </p> <p>One of the reasons that specialists can keep the price down is that they are more likely to ask detailed questions about the state of the property. They will also insist on safety checks being carried out. 'Too many fires are caused by faulty electrics and when there is a fire it is almost invariably a total loss,' says Ratcliffe. Both Country Thatch and Holman Insurance Brokers, for example, insist that owners have their wiring, chimneys, fireplaces and other heating appliances checked. </p> <p>You may also find that it is a condition of the insurance that you take certain fire-prevention measures such as having a fire extinguisher on every floor, not using naked flames in the roof space and not lighting fires within a certain distance of the property. These are all things that benefit the insurer (because they reduce the likelihood of a claim), but expert advice on anti-fire measures also benefits owners who are unlikely to want to see their homes rapidly go up in smoke. </p> <p>As Maureen Galloway of Holman Insurance Brokers points out, such advice is particularly valuable for people new to living in thatched properties who may not be aware of the hazards involved. </p> <p>Mainstream insurers may not agree, but people who live in listed buildings should be less worried about fire and more worried about the risk of being underinsured. 'Owners of listed buildings tend to be under-insured by as much as a third - sometimes more,' says Nicholas Tufton, an independent surveyor who specialises in valuing listed buildings and other period properties. 'The biggest mistake people make is insuring for the market value of the property rather than the cost of rebuilding it.' </p> <p>The problem of under-insurance is particularly acute for owners of listed property for two main reasons. First, rebuilding costs tend to be higher because of the specialist materials and labour involved. Second, where owners of conventional properties have choices in rebuilding, owners of listed buildings do not. English Heritage has the legal right to insist that a property is restored to its former glory - which can include specifying the exact materials to be used for the restoration as well as the contractor who will carry out the work. </p> <p>In the case of the owner of a burnt-down listed property in Sussex which cost \u00a32 million to rebuild, the stringent requirements of English Heritage contributed to the additional \u00a3500,000 he had to find to make up for his under-insurance. </p> <p>Andrew Jobson of brokers Jobson Needham believes that owners of listed buildings should consider a policy from a specialist insurer such as Chubb (which has no connection to the lock company) or Hiscox. These insurers are primarily targeting very affluent property owners who also have antiques, fine art collections and valuable jewellery to insure. But these policies can be equally suitable for people who own homes (whether listed or not) with a rebuilding cost in the region of \u00a3250,000 to \u00a3300,000 (and contents worth a minimum of \u00a375,000). </p> <p>But does specialist mean more expensive? Jobson says not, and points out that the cover is better. What is worth having is the guarantees they are prepared to offer. Provided you have a recent specialist valuation of the rebuilding cost of your property (Chubb has its own valuers to do this; Hiscox can point you in the direction of a suitable expert), they will agree not to cap the sum insured. This means that even if the cost of rebuilding your home turns out to be more than the figure you were insured for, the claim will be met in full.

What is your strategy for setting up the company and making it a business success? </p> <p>Answers to this question could help devise a new and more effective strategy for combating illegal drugs.

      "bodyText": "Imagine this: you are an MBA student sitting your final exam on business strategy and the question on your exam paper is: You have developed a new product, emotec, which gives customers sensations of pleasure, confidence and calm when they use it. For cost reasons you want to develop it in Indonesia. What is your strategy for setting up the company and making it a business success? Answers to this question could help devise a new and more effective strategy for combating illegal drugs. At present, as the FT pointed out last week, efforts to control the trade are an expensive failure. Occasional successes pale into insignificance compared with the scale and growth of the illegal trade. Surprisingly, the drugs trade is rarely viewed and described as an industry. But that's what it is - one run by clever and talented entrepreneurs who produce a product, transport it to market and sell it to enthusiastic customers who are not very concerned about price. The aim of most governments, Britain's included, is to suppress the industry or its influence - but this approach focuses solely on the market: identifying customers, their needs and, most importantly, the means of persuading them to stop consuming.
