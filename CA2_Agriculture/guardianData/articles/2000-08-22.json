Ruth Lelacheur, 30, suffered bruising to the back of her ear and a damaged tooth as a result of the alleged attack by Jonathan Edmonds at Wembley stadium in March last year. Edmonds, 31, of Slough, Berkshire, denied charges of affray and actual bodily harm. Michael Latham, prosecuting, said Miss Lelacheur, a Leicester City fan, was in a family enclosure with her partner and her daughter, Megan, three, when a dispute arose about the presence of Spurs fans. He said Megan fell and Miss Lelacheur felt blows to the ear and to her jaw. After the pictures were shown on Crimewatch, Mr Edmonds went to a police station and denied assault. Mr Latham said Mr Edmonds claimed he was pushed over and hit out in self defence. \"He is saying the blows were not directed at Miss Lelacheur.\" Miss Lelacheur told the court there had been a carnival atmosphere before the incident. \"But then we heard a group of about five to seven Tottenham fans sitting just behind us shouting: 'We are Tottenham'. \"A lot of Leicester fans then started shouting that the Spurs fans shouldn't have been in that part of the ground.\" Cross-examining, Gavin Meerylees said he did not dispute that Miss Lelacheur had been hit by his client.

      "body": "<p>The sky is blue, the sun has come out at last, but from inside a sweltering office, the rays can seem malevolent. This is August, the month of holidays and, for those stuck in the office, the month of resentment. </p> <p>If it's pouring with rain, we curse the typical British summer; if the sun shines, we curse the fact that we can't get out to enjoy it. If the workload takes a dramatic nosedive, we curse again because the days become interminably long - but even worse is when one employee ends up buckling under the weight of three people's jobs and coping with crises that normally go unnoticed because someone else deals with them. </p> <p>But August in the office doesn't have to be depressing. Cristina Odone has been moved up a notch from her job as deputy editor of the New Statesman to acting editor while the editor, Peter Wilby, follows the politicians into summer recess. She says she has discovered all sorts of unexpected pleasures in being office-bound while all around are not. While she admits \"there are climactic difficulties associated with working through August and a little bit of martyrdom when everyone else is away\", her solution is to take long, lingering breaks in the middle of the day. \"A three-hour lunch is a good antidote,\" she suggests. </p> <p>She believes getting the opportunity to stretch yourself beyond your job description is something everyone should have a shot at. \"I'm enjoying proving to Peter that I can do it without him. For 11 months of the year the buck stops with him, but suddenly it's stopping with me. Instead of him leaving the office at midnight on deadline day, I'm doing that, so there's a sense of complicity with him. I understand much better what his job involves and it's nice to know I'm capable of it.\" </p> <p>But in case Wilby is reading this, she assures him no coup is planned. \"While in the abstract I suppose August is the month in which employees can plot a takeover while the boss is out of the way, I'm not sure that works in practice. To pull off such a coup you need to be able to show off to proprietors or board members. But they'll probably be away sunning themselves under coconut palms, too, and there's not much point putting on a show in the office if you're playing to an audience of one.\" </p> <p>One of the biggest joys of August is undoubtedly the under-crowded commute. It is the only time of the year when it's possible to sit on the bus or tube and fling open a newspaper without shoving your elbow into the mouth of the unfortunate soul squashed up next to you. And the office environment becomes almost benign with no queues for the coffee machine and more oxygen per person. </p> <p>Ben Williams, a chartered corporate psychologist, believes these temporarily spacious arrangements have a positive impact on workplace performance. \"When too many people are crowded together, you get a behavioural sink. People feel they can get away with more because there are too many people around for them to be closely observed. When experiments were carried out cramming rats into a confined space, a rise in delinquency was noted among them. When there are fewer people and everyone is more closely observed, they take more responsibility for their actions.\" </p> <p>Perhaps one of the most salutary lessons about August work patterns is that while the pace is slower, things still get done. John Hildebrand, of the City firm Investec Asset Management, says: \"Everything is so much more relaxed in August. Dress codes are easier, with more chinos than pinstripes, and people are more likely to go for a drink after work, but things still happen. Traditionally the financial markets are weaker in August and there's a feeling that nothing's going on. But actually big mergers and takeovers don't always stop during the summer break - we've just had all the excitement with Barclays taking over the Woolwich.\" </p> <p>The public sector can have particular problems finding enough staff to cover frontline hospital and residential care home services in August - managers see this month as a \"mini-millennium\" in terms of juggling essential services with staff's desire to head off on holiday. </p> <p>Mike Boyle, project team leader for asylum seekers and refugees at the Local Government Association, has to deal with emergencies all year round. But he says that even though the numbers of asylum seekers don't reduce in August, he loves this month. \"It's great. The services for asylum seekers still get provided but all the Home Office officials I liaise with are away and I can catch up on reading and writing reports. Usually if I arrive at the office after a meeting, I'll have 40 emails and 15 phone messages waiting for me. When I get in today I'll be surprised if I have two phone messages and any emails.\" </p> <p>John Wilson, professor of occupational ergonomics at Nottingham University, believes August isn't quite what it used to be in terms of a slump in workload. \"I've noticed that more and more colleagues take their lap-tops and mobile phones away on holiday with them and send and receive emails on the beach.\" </p> <p>Even universities, which were once deserts during the summer, now buzz with life. \"The car park here used to empty in August,\" Wilson says, \"but at the moment it's almost full. Academics can't just go off to summer schools any more. The pressure on research is so great that they're all here. </p> <p>\"Everyone is in some sort of supply chain, whether they're in a service industry, health or education, so people have less to do to keep running round the hamster wheel.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, Wilson believes it is hard to know whether we are just doing too much wasteful work the rest of the year. \"There are certainly more internal audits and more managers than there were 15 years ago. Some say they don't improve services but things may well be worse without them.\" </p> <p>But Boyle is convinced that a more streamlined approach is the way to workplace salvation. \"The rest of the year, I end up coming into work before 9am and not leaving until 9pm. During August I arrive at a normal time and leave at a normal time. I think this is the only month in which we've got our working practices right. It's the other 11 months we've got real problems with.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Women will suffer even more discrimination at work if the government goes ahead with plans to extend maternity leave without offering equivalent fathers' rights, the Industrial Society warns today in an outspoken attack on ministers' attempts to promote family-friendly policies. </p> <p>It would be \"entirely rational\" for employers to recruit men instead of women if they took the cost of the government's proposals for improved maternity rights into account, the society says. Its intervention comes as ministers are beginning preparations on Labour's next election manifesto, which is expected to make an eight-week extension of maternity leave the centrepiece of a strategy to woo women voters. </p> <p>\"Every extension of maternity rights that is not matched by an equivalent extension of paternity rights is a step in the wrong direction. </p> <p>\"Every such move gives employers a rational reason to choose Bob over Mary and seals half the workforce into the 'woman-equals-mother-equals-carer' trap,\" the society says, in the first report of a series entitled Future Provocations. </p> <p>Unlike many previous criticisms of equal opportunities policies, which have come from a rightwing free market perspective, it was written by Richard Reeves, a former adviser to Labour ministers and left-leaning journalist. </p> <p>He said last night: \"For the first time in the 49 year history of A-levels, girls have gained a higher proportion of the top three grades than boys. But that success is not going to translate into workplace success unless we break down the roles attached to motherhood and fatherhood. </p> <p>\"The government, the equal opportunities commission, the TUC and most groups campaigning for parents all make the same mistake of thinking that the pay gap between men and women is irrational and some stern talking will do the trick. In fact, given the current policies and gender roles, it is entirely rational - and no amount of talking will do the trick.\" </p> <p>The report includes the results of a survey of parents showing that 68% of mothers were usually called first if a child was ill, compared to 13% of fathers. </p> <p>The society is calling for parental leave to be paid at 90% of wages for six weeks, arguing that if the government were to offer a flat rate of around \u00a3150 a week, high income fathers would not be encouraged to take time off to look after their children. </p> <p>\"By and large, it is better-off men who run businesses and therefore set the tone for organisations in terms of the acceptability of time off for childcare. There is little hope of attitudes changing if the men dictating workplace cultures are not taking time off,\" the report says. </p> <p>Last night the government denied its policies were biased towards protecting women at work. </p> <p>A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: \"This government has done more than any other government to ensure that both mothers and fathers can effectively balance their work and home lives.\" </p> <p>\"It is nonsense to suggest that women's role as mothers makes them less attractive to employers.\" </p> <p>\"More women are working than ever before, making up nearly half the workforce - double the number 25 years ago. Since 1980 the proportion of mothers with children under five who are in paid work has increased from 28% to 53%.\" </p> <p>She added: \"Women's skills are vital to the success of UK plc. Businesses recognise that it is in the interests of their bottom line to ensure that women reach their full potential. </p> <p>\"Good, successful companies recognise that if they offer flexible working practices they will get a more loyal and motivated workforce - this will increase their productivity and give them a competitive edge. </p> <p>\"Both women and men are demanding a better balance between work and home life. That is why the government has started a review looking at how working parents - both men and women - can be given more choice to help them balance their work and family life.\"</p>",

Its intervention comes as ministers are beginning preparations on Labour's next election manifesto, which is expected to make an eight-week extension of maternity leave the centrepiece of a strategy to woo women voters. \"Every extension of maternity rights that is not matched by an equivalent extension of paternity rights is a step in the wrong direction. \"Every such move gives employers a rational reason to choose Bob over Mary and seals half the workforce into the 'woman-equals-mother-equals-carer' trap,\" the society says, in the first report of a series entitled Future Provocations. Unlike many previous criticisms of equal opportunities policies, which have come from a rightwing free market perspective, it was written by Richard Reeves, a former adviser to Labour ministers and left-leaning journalist. He said last night: \"For the first time in the 49 year history of A-levels, girls have gained a higher proportion of the top three grades than boys. But that success is not going to translate into workplace success unless we break down the roles attached to motherhood and fatherhood. \"The government, the equal opportunities commission, the TUC and most groups campaigning for parents all make the same mistake of thinking that the pay gap between men and women is irrational and some stern talking will do the trick. In fact, given the current policies and gender roles, it is entirely rational - and no amount of talking will do the trick.\" The report includes the results of a survey of parents showing that 68% of mothers were usually called first if a child was ill, compared to 13% of fathers. The society is calling for parental leave to be paid at 90% of wages for six weeks, arguing that if the government were to offer a flat rate of around \u00a3150 a week, high income fathers would not be encouraged to take time off to look after their children. \"By and large, it is better-off men who run businesses and therefore set the tone for organisations in terms of the acceptability of time off for childcare. There is little hope of attitudes changing if the men dictating workplace cultures are not taking time off,\" the report says. Last night the government denied its policies were biased towards protecting women at work. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: \"This government has done more than any other government to ensure that both mothers and fathers can effectively balance their work and home lives.\" \"It is nonsense to suggest that women's role as mothers makes them less attractive to employers.\" \"More women are working than ever before, making up nearly half the workforce - double the number 25 years ago. Since 1980 the proportion of mothers with children under five who are in paid work has increased from 28% to 53%.\" She added: \"Women's skills are vital to the success of UK plc. Businesses recognise that it is in the interests of their bottom line to ensure that women reach their full potential. \"Good, successful companies recognise that if they offer flexible working practices they will get a more loyal and motivated workforce - this will increase their productivity and give them a competitive edge. \"Both women and men are demanding a better balance between work and home life. That is why the government has started a review looking at how working parents - both men and women - can be given more choice to help them balance their work and family life.\"",

      "body": "<p>McCoy Tyner is back in London for a 10th summer at the Jazz Cafe, and if you haven't seen him yet, grab the chance. You've got a treat coming. This man is not just full of musical ideas; he's bursting at the seams. \"Listen to the great players, pick up some licks,\" say teachers of jazz. A pianist like McCoy Tyner can impart enough in three bars to last a year. </p> <p>Bassist Avery Sharpe and drummer Aaron Scott were both back for another year. The threesome strode down to the stage, immaculately dressed, and launched into the show with a number Tyner wrote for John Coltrane, his inspiration and employer in the 60s. The piece was crashing, chromatic, mercurial, racy - all characteristic of Tyner's mode of attack.

      "bodyText": "McCoy Tyner is back in London for a 10th summer at the Jazz Cafe, and if you haven't seen him yet, grab the chance. You've got a treat coming. This man is not just full of musical ideas; he's bursting at the seams. \"Listen to the great players, pick up some licks,\" say teachers of jazz. A pianist like McCoy Tyner can impart enough in three bars to last a year. Bassist Avery Sharpe and drummer Aaron Scott were both back for another year. The threesome strode down to the stage, immaculately dressed, and launched into the show with a number Tyner wrote for John Coltrane, his inspiration and employer in the 60s. The piece was crashing, chromatic, mercurial, racy - all characteristic of Tyner's mode of attack. He has worked with some great drummers in his time, including Elvin Jones, who is in London next week, but he and Scott seem close musical soulmates, sharing such an intense musical sensibility that when the pianist played tricky solo passages the drummer would trace the notes in reverie. Next, he pulled out Will You Be Mine? to demonstrate his ability for quick mood changes: from tea dance waltz to Rottweiler bark to music hall gaiety in the slip of a second. In The Tradition, a tune from Tyner's newest CD, had a Latin feel, with Scott in the background weaving quietly perplexing rhythms with his brushes and Sharpe taking his cue from Tyner to wind in growlier ideas on bass guitar. It can't be easy for Sharpe to stand out, sandwiched between Scott and Tyner, but his double-bass solo in the middle of the set was a class act.

End-of-season fixture clutter is one thing, first-week-of-the-season congestion is a different kettle of crackpot contrivance. </p> <p>Just over 48 hours after tough opening matches on Saturday, Arsenal and Liverpool were matched against each other. The latter's manager G\u00e9rard Houllier got his excuses in first: \"Players need rest between big matches.

But Sky needed a big one to launch its \"Monday Match\" and to blazes with fairness, tiredness and anything else? End-of-season fixture clutter is one thing, first-week-of-the-season congestion is a different kettle of crackpot contrivance. Just over 48 hours after tough opening matches on Saturday, Arsenal and Liverpool were matched against each other.

The 31-year-old, who was picked in England's problem position on the left for last season's friendly with Belgium, said he would knuckle down but made it clear he does not intend to be a squad player. Roberto Baggio, 33, out of contract and training alone at Internazionale, is still looking for a new club after the French First Division leaders Lens denied an interest. \"I can't sell myself for pocket change,\" he said. \"But it's not for economic reasons that I don't have a team. Foreign teams have sought me out with serious offers but I prefer to remain in Italy. It's a life choice.\" The Scotland defender Paul Ritchie, 25, has completed a \u00a3500,000 move to Manchester City from Rangers, where he failed to play a game after his Bosman move from Hearts. \"Paul has signed a four-year contract,\" said Chris Bird, City's chief operating officer. Norwich have signed Arsenal's Dublin-born defender Brian McGovern, 20, for \u00a350,000 though the fee will rise to \u00a3250 000 when he has played 80 games. And Reading have confirmed the signing of Jamie Cureton, 24, from Bristol Rovers for \u00a3250,000. The former Norwich striker scored 22 league goals last season. Kevin Kyle, the Sunderland forward who impressed in the recent Under-19 Milk Cup, has been named in the Scotland Under-21 squad to face Latvia in Riga on Friday week. Scotland Under-21 squad Esson (Aberdeen), Gallacher (Dundee United), Langfield (Dundee), Stewart (Kilmarnock); Caldwell (Newcastle), Canero (Kilmarnock), Doig (Nottm Forest), Fraser (Luton ), Jordan (Bristol City), Neilson (Hearts), Wilkie (Dundee); Cummings (Chelsea), Easton (Dundee United), Hughes (Bournemouth), Murray (Hibernian), Paterson (Dundee United), Severin (Hearts), Stewart (Man Utd); Burchill (Celtic), Kyle (Sunderland), Miller (Rangers), Notman (Man Utd), Young (Aberdeen).",

      "trailText": "<p>Ross Dixon, Laura Baron and David Crook talk about what happened to them after their GCSEs</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Ross Dixon</strong> </p> <p> Ross, 20, did two years of A-levels at Cardinal Newman RC Sixth Form College in Preston and then a BTec National in multimedia at Preston College. He's got a place at the University of Central Lancashire to do a BSc in web design and multimedia. He plays guitar in a punk band, goes surfing and works part-time as a lifeguard at Leyland Leisure Centre. </p> <p>Ross didn't have any plans when he left school but got good GCSE grades so decided to do A-levels in subjects he enjoyed - biology, design technology and media studies. He soon started to have doubts.</p> <p>\"It was a big step from GCSEs and although I kept trying, by the end of the first year I realised I couldn't continue. I've always been involved in music and would like my own business, so in the second year I carried on with design tech and started business studies and music technology. However, by May I realised I'd made a mistake and knew I had to sort myself out over the summer.</p> <p>\"My careers adviser suggested several options - I chose the BTec National in multimedia. I've really enjoyed the course and now realise that A-levels just weren't right for me - I'd rather be doing something than writing about it. The BTec is really practical, I've tried loads of different things and developed my own strengths. It was definitely the right choice for me. I don't think of the two years doing A-levels as wasted - I learnt a lot - I just didn't get any certificates. I see it as two years looking for what I really wanted. Some people are lucky and find what they want when they leave school, I just took a bit longer.\" </p> <p> <strong> Laura Baron</strong></p> <p> Laura, 17, is taking GNVQ Advanced in Business at Preston College, plans to study business at university and wants a career in marketing, computing or retail management. </p> <p>She went to Corpus Christi RC High School in Preston, works part time in Sports Soccer and likes going out, computers, fashion and music. </p> <p>Laura had applied to do A-levels at college and was thrilled with her GCSE results - two Bs and four Cs meant she was in - so it was a huge shock at enrolment a week later to find that because the college only counted one of her English grades, she didn't have enough points. \"I was absolutely gutted. The college suggested other courses, but I was too upset to listen. I felt I'd failed and if I couldn't do A-levels there was nothing else for me.\" </p> <p>Laura went back the next day. Because she'd applied for A-level business studies, the college suggested a GNVQ Advanced in business. \"When they explained that it was equivalent to A-levels and could still get me into university, I didn't feel so bad. It's a lot more practical than A-levels and based on course work, not exams. I decided to take it. I did feel a bit negative at first, but actually I liked it from day one.\" </p> <p>A year on, and Laura has no regrets. The GNVQ means concentrating on one subject. There are assignments and course work with short unit tests, as well as work experience. Laura has also been able to improve her maths grade and is taking law and Spanish next year. Laura feels she's gained vital practical skills that she wouldn't have got from A-levels. </p> <p>\"The GNVQ is really good, I'm getting qualifications and experience, I'm more aware of all the options available. </p> <p>\"Don't worry if you do worse than you expected. With hard work you can do anything and get any job you want, and don't think you've failed because you're not doing A-levels - you haven't.\" </p> <p> <strong> David Crook</strong> </p> <p> David is 17. He went to Our Lady's RC High School in Preston and got three Cs, three Ds and two Es at GCSE. He's a trainee accounts clerk for Legal &amp; Trade Financial Services, Preston. His interests are music, sport, football and computers. </p> <p>David always knew he didn't want to go to college. \"You can work your way up and take qualifications whilst you're getting experience in business, so I wanted to get a job when I left school. You can do university-level courses part-time, so why be a student and get into debt? </p> <p>I applied for about 15 jobs, most wanted four Cs including maths and English. I was expecting at least that, so was shocked by my results - three Cs with a D in English. I thought I'd never get a job and would have to go to college. I went to enrol and was put on a GNVQ Foundation in IT - there was a week before term started and I kept hoping for a job offer. We were given a list of topics on the first day of term - I didn't want to do any of them, I just wanted to get out there and get a job. </p> <p>The day after I started, I applied to Legal &amp; Trade, a week later I had an interview. I'm ambitious and motivated and this came across. I was offered the job on a Thursday and started the next Monday, after just two weeks at college. </p> <p>I started as an office junior, doing NVQ level 2 in business administration. A month ago I was offered the post of trainee accounts clerk and will start AAT [Association of Accounting Technicians] exams soon. </p> <p>I'm learning all the time, by 28 I should be a manager and well on the way to qualifying as an accountant. Results really don't signify - I got my job through ambition and determination, you've just got to be positive and go for it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ross Dixon Ross, 20, did two years of A-levels at Cardinal Newman RC Sixth Form College in Preston and then a BTec National in multimedia at Preston College. He's got a place at the University of Central Lancashire to do a BSc in web design and multimedia. He plays guitar in a punk band, goes surfing and works part-time as a lifeguard at Leyland Leisure Centre. Ross didn't have any plans when he left school but got good GCSE grades so decided to do A-levels in subjects he enjoyed - biology, design technology and media studies. He soon started to have doubts. \"It was a big step from GCSEs and although I kept trying, by the end of the first year I realised I couldn't continue. I've always been involved in music and would like my own business, so in the second year I carried on with design tech and started business studies and music technology. However, by May I realised I'd made a mistake and knew I had to sort myself out over the summer. \"My careers adviser suggested several options - I chose the BTec National in multimedia. I've really enjoyed the course and now realise that A-levels just weren't right for me - I'd rather be doing something than writing about it. The BTec is really practical, I've tried loads of different things and developed my own strengths. It was definitely the right choice for me. I don't think of the two years doing A-levels as wasted - I learnt a lot - I just didn't get any certificates. I see it as two years looking for what I really wanted. Some people are lucky and find what they want when they leave school, I just took a bit longer.\" Laura Baron Laura, 17, is taking GNVQ Advanced in Business at Preston College, plans to study business at university and wants a career in marketing, computing or retail management. She went to Corpus Christi RC High School in Preston, works part time in Sports Soccer and likes going out, computers, fashion and music. Laura had applied to do A-levels at college and was thrilled with her GCSE results - two Bs and four Cs meant she was in - so it was a huge shock at enrolment a week later to find that because the college only counted one of her English grades, she didn't have enough points. \"I was absolutely gutted. The college suggested other courses, but I was too upset to listen. I felt I'd failed and if I couldn't do A-levels there was nothing else for me.\" Laura went back the next day. Because she'd applied for A-level business studies, the college suggested a GNVQ Advanced in business. \"When they explained that it was equivalent to A-levels and could still get me into university, I didn't feel so bad. It's a lot more practical than A-levels and based on course work, not exams. I decided to take it. I did feel a bit negative at first, but actually I liked it from day one.\" A year on, and Laura has no regrets. The GNVQ means concentrating on one subject. There are assignments and course work with short unit tests, as well as work experience. Laura has also been able to improve her maths grade and is taking law and Spanish next year. Laura feels she's gained vital practical skills that she wouldn't have got from A-levels. \"The GNVQ is really good, I'm getting qualifications and experience, I'm more aware of all the options available. \"Don't worry if you do worse than you expected. With hard work you can do anything and get any job you want, and don't think you've failed because you're not doing A-levels - you haven't.\" David Crook David is 17. He went to Our Lady's RC High School in Preston and got three Cs, three Ds and two Es at GCSE. He's a trainee accounts clerk for Legal &amp; Trade Financial Services, Preston. His interests are music, sport, football and computers. David always knew he didn't want to go to college. \"You can work your way up and take qualifications whilst you're getting experience in business, so I wanted to get a job when I left school. You can do university-level courses part-time, so why be a student and get into debt? I applied for about 15 jobs, most wanted four Cs including maths and English. I was expecting at least that, so was shocked by my results - three Cs with a D in English. I thought I'd never get a job and would have to go to college. I went to enrol and was put on a GNVQ Foundation in IT - there was a week before term started and I kept hoping for a job offer. We were given a list of topics on the first day of term - I didn't want to do any of them, I just wanted to get out there and get a job. The day after I started, I applied to Legal &amp; Trade, a week later I had an interview. I'm ambitious and motivated and this came across. I was offered the job on a Thursday and started the next Monday, after just two weeks at college. I started as an office junior, doing NVQ level 2 in business administration. A month ago I was offered the post of trainee accounts clerk and will start AAT [Association of Accounting Technicians] exams soon. I'm learning all the time, by 28 I should be a manager and well on the way to qualifying as an accountant. Results really don't signify - I got my job through ambition and determination, you've just got to be positive and go for it.",

      "body": "<p>Thursday's GCSE results are expected to show a record gender gap, with a far greater proportion of girls than boys getting five or more decent grades. Bouquets for the babes who have struggled to do well? Not a bit of it. David Blunkett, the education secretary, has opted, instead, to talk of backlash and retribution. It's an age-old theme, but none the less potent for that: women can succeed only at the price of men's failure. It exploits the female tendency to take the blame. </p> <p>But it's also a load of old cobblers, and a dangerous one at that, since it distracts from the analysis of how we persuade boys to try harder. At the same time, it fuels the myth that women have never had it so good - when all the evidence of what happens to the majority of women, in spite of their superior qualifications, is that men still rule OK, while female talent goes to waste. If only Mr Blunkett would address himself to this imbalance with a similar apocalyptic fervour. </p> <p>\"Unless we get things right now,\" he said at the weekend, \"there will be a very substantial backlash from males and that would be to nobody's benefit. It is in the interests of everyone, not least young women, that young men have status, a sense of purpose and self-esteem in life.\" </p> <p>He continued that the drive towards equal opportunities had concentrated on \"promoting the interests of women\". \"I don't want to go back to that position but to reassert a degree of balance,\" he said. \"This is critical to avoiding ... a resentment that the pendulum has swung from gross inequality for women to aggressive assertiveness.\" </p> <p>Mr Blunkett should get a grip. Many boys and girls are doing all right academically (although a lot less impressively then elsewhere in Europe). A proportion at the bottom are not. </p> <p>As Mr Blunkett rightly says, some of the problem is to do with the demise of apprenticeships. I did my A-levels in a town called Wolverton whose lifeline was the railway works. When it folded, so did many of the futures of the young men in the town who'd messed about in school as jack-the-lads secure in the knowledge that they would acquire a trade (and status, a man's way of life and a decent wage) as apprentice electricians and tool-makers. </p> <p>The problem here is not boys being intimidated by alleged female self-confidence but the loss of these traditional avenues, now replaced by training schemes that have a reputation among the young for leading nowhere. The problem here is not girls' \"aggressive assertiveness\" - does Mr Blunkett know any 14-year-old girls? - but the cultural message that \"real\" men don't have to try hard: it all falls in their lap as a God-given right. </p> <p>So, instead of talking about \"backlash\", Mr Blunkett should have praised girls for their spirit in adapting to the modern world - often, still against the odds - and pledged to find ways of encouraging boys to redefine masculinity (a word that rarely passes Mr Blunkett's lips) so that it means more than the wage a man earns and a stoic refusal to show emotion. </p> <p>Of course, we all want young men to have status, a sense of purpose and self-esteem but it's daft to claim, as Mr Blunkett does, that \"a laddish culture has grown out of deprivation and a lack of self-confidence and opportunity\". It also comes as a result of decades of conditioning and behaviour once deemed normal. Now, just as 50s women - housewives and mothers - had to learn to adjust to a very different world, so 21st-century man has to make the leap too. </p> <p>Blunkett could be making speeches, for instance, on the importance of emotional literacy in boys.

      "bodyText": "Thursday's GCSE results are expected to show a record gender gap, with a far greater proportion of girls than boys getting five or more decent grades. Bouquets for the babes who have struggled to do well? Not a bit of it. David Blunkett, the education secretary, has opted, instead, to talk of backlash and retribution. It's an age-old theme, but none the less potent for that: women can succeed only at the price of men's failure. It exploits the female tendency to take the blame. But it's also a load of old cobblers, and a dangerous one at that, since it distracts from the analysis of how we persuade boys to try harder. At the same time, it fuels the myth that women have never had it so good - when all the evidence of what happens to the majority of women, in spite of their superior qualifications, is that men still rule OK, while female talent goes to waste. If only Mr Blunkett would address himself to this imbalance with a similar apocalyptic fervour. \"Unless we get things right now,\" he said at the weekend, \"there will be a very substantial backlash from males and that would be to nobody's benefit. It is in the interests of everyone, not least young women, that young men have status, a sense of purpose and self-esteem in life.\" He continued that the drive towards equal opportunities had concentrated on \"promoting the interests of women\". \"I don't want to go back to that position but to reassert a degree of balance,\" he said. \"This is critical to avoiding ... a resentment that the pendulum has swung from gross inequality for women to aggressive assertiveness.\" Mr Blunkett should get a grip. Many boys and girls are doing all right academically (although a lot less impressively then elsewhere in Europe). A proportion at the bottom are not. As Mr Blunkett rightly says, some of the problem is to do with the demise of apprenticeships. I did my A-levels in a town called Wolverton whose lifeline was the railway works. When it folded, so did many of the futures of the young men in the town who'd messed about in school as jack-the-lads secure in the knowledge that they would acquire a trade (and status, a man's way of life and a decent wage) as apprentice electricians and tool-makers. The problem here is not boys being intimidated by alleged female self-confidence but the loss of these traditional avenues, now replaced by training schemes that have a reputation among the young for leading nowhere. The problem here is not girls' \"aggressive assertiveness\" - does Mr Blunkett know any 14-year-old girls? - but the cultural message that \"real\" men don't have to try hard: it all falls in their lap as a God-given right. So, instead of talking about \"backlash\", Mr Blunkett should have praised girls for their spirit in adapting to the modern world - often, still against the odds - and pledged to find ways of encouraging boys to redefine masculinity (a word that rarely passes Mr Blunkett's lips) so that it means more than the wage a man earns and a stoic refusal to show emotion. Of course, we all want young men to have status, a sense of purpose and self-esteem but it's daft to claim, as Mr Blunkett does, that \"a laddish culture has grown out of deprivation and a lack of self-confidence and opportunity\". It also comes as a result of decades of conditioning and behaviour once deemed normal. Now, just as 50s women - housewives and mothers - had to learn to adjust to a very different world, so 21st-century man has to make the leap too. Blunkett could be making speeches, for instance, on the importance of emotional literacy in boys. He could be setting quotas in the childcare and \"caring\" sectors to encourage boys into those jobs too. He could be urging the importance of \"balance\" not just between the genders, but in work and home. He could also acknowledge that if we are to give urgent attention to the problem of some boys failing to fulfil their potential, first we have to answer other questions. Fulfilling their potential to do what? To be whom? And measured by what criteria of success? At the same time, Mr Blunkett - to ensure that he really does know which way the pendulum is swinging - should apprise himself of the state of women. According to research published this year, a woman who chooses not to have children and competes equally with men will still on average earn \u00a3100,000 less over a lifetime; a mother pays a female forfeit of \u00a3250,000.

Women are still penalised in work because the gatekeepers who judge ability are predominantly men. So, in 1998, women comprised only 3.6% of directors. And so it goes on and on. Recently, Sue Tibballs conducted research on women who distanced themselves firmly from feminism and felt culpable for the plight of some men. Even they were united in seeing themselves as outsiders in a persistent male culture resistant to their skills, contributions and needs. Think before you speak, Mr Blunkett. comment@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p><strong>THE GRAHAM POLL EXTRAVAGANZA</strong></p> <p>Poor Graham Poll. Last night, he worked his cards off to entertain the public in his one-man extravaganza 'Graham Poll presents Graham Poll's The Graham Poll Show (starring Graham Poll)'. But who ended up as the centre of attention? Not him, that's for sure. All everyone wants to talk about is what happened to one of the extras, one Patrick Vieira. Where's the justice? Honestly, anyone would think people paid money to watch players perform.</p> <p>Poll's excellent display of whistlemanship - as well as sending off Vieira for next to nothing, he sent Gary McAllister off for nearly nowt and Dietmar Hamann for nigh-on nada - managed to anger both managers as well as all the players. But nobody was more upset than Vieira, who, having been harshly dismissed for the second time in two matches, threw his shirt to the ground and stomped into Highbury's marble halls muttering dark threats about leaving the country.</p> <p>Vieira's mood wouldn't have been lightened this morning, either. An FA spokesman confirmed that, because he was sent off for two bookable offences, he cannot appeal against Poll's decision. \"This is an automatic ban,\" the apparatchik read out from the rule book, explaining that only McAllister, who collected a Poll Super Special (a straight red), has any right of appeal.</p> <p>So will Vieira make good his escape in the direction of, say, long-time suitors Juventus? His team-mate and good friend Thierry Henry doesn't seem to think so. \"I don't think he will,\" an emotional Henry said today. \"I really don't want him to leave. The fans love him and his team-mates want him at the club.\" Which sounds promising. But if the worst should happen, let's remember to keep things in perspective. The Premiership can do without the likes of Vieira - but what sort of dull league would we be left with if Graham and his mates weren't allowed to strut their stuff?</p> <p><strong>DYER CONSEQUENCES</strong></p> <p>Kieron Dyer is a man of many faces. He is known to many as sex-hell-shame Kieron after his summer antics in Cyprus involving a video camera, a bed, some girls and Rio Ferdinand. But to the Venerable Bobby Robson esq. he is known as future-of-Newcastle-United Kieron. When he's not known as Brian, or Ronald, at least.</p> <p>Reports in this morning's papers suggested that Kieron (either version) is wanted by Arsene's Arsenal Wenger as a replacement for the departed Emmanuel Petit. The card-happy Gunners were apparently willing to pay \u00a38.5m, \u00a32.5m more than Newcastle paid for Dyer last year. But the venerable Bobster was having none of it. \"Kieron Dyer is a little gem of a player. He is the future of Newcastle United and he is going nowhere\", he told today's Newcastle Evening Chronicle. \"In fact to put it quite simply, Kieron Dyer is not for sale. And don't forget we are one of the biggest clubs in the country - so why should anyone want to leave here?\"</p> <p>Why indeed. Unless they want to win trophies, the crazy fools. Anyway, Mr Robert's vehemence just goes to show how Kieron has bucked up his ideas since his little spot of bother in the summer. Bobby claimed to have \"court-martialled\" his midfielder a couple of months ago, but today he revealed: \"We have been very impressed with Kieron in the past few weeks. Where was he last night? Watching our reserves. When I went into the dressing room, Kieron was sitting in the corner giving some of our younger players moral support.\" But not selling them videos, obviously.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I was through with only the goalkeeper to beat in the last minute but I shot against his legs as he came out and it is haunting me\" - Some people see headless horsemen, others ghoulish monks. Hassan Kachloul meanwhile has visions of an onrushing Mart Poom.</p> <p><strong>WHAT THE BUCKLEY SAW</strong></p> <p>We're not asking you to cry for Alan Buckley. The manager who, against all the odds, won the Auto Windscreens shield for Grimsby, got them promotion to the First Division and, while we're on the subject, kept them there, does not need your sympathy. However, he has just got the sack after two league games, so if you've got any oddjobs that need doing while he finds his feet, we're sure it would be much appreciated.</p> <p>\"We felt this was the right decision for the sake of the club,\" Grimsby's vice-chairman Bryan Huxford said today, after announcing that Buckley had got the boot and would be temporarily replaced by his assistant John Cockerill. \"We waited after last season to see if things would improve but after two games nothing appears to have changed.\" All of two games, in which Grimsby were only beaten once. Imagine how bad things might have got had they waited another week.</p> <p>Now that Buckley is out of the way, the only thing Grimsby need to embark upon an era of European domination is a new manager. \"It's a big job,\" said Huxford, \"and we've got to find a manager that's got credibility, is well founded and has got the ability to run a very tight ship on a very tight budget. Similar to what Alan's done.\" Right, so that's a manager who'll be able to be as successful as Buckley, with the resources that were available to Buckley, for the same wages as Buckley was on. Can anybody think of a suitable candidate?</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Sylvain Wiltord will be allowed to join Arsenal if Bordeaux complete the \u00a32m signing of former Manchester United winger Karel Poborsky from Benfica.</p> <p>Blackburn have made a \u00a34m offer for St Etienne defender Lucien Mottomo.</p> <p>Wolves have made an inquiry for Huddersfield centre-half Chris Lucketti. They may be put off by the price, though. Huddersfield chairman Ian Ayre said: \"We rate Lucketti in the same bracket as Hermann Hreidarsson who has just been sold by Wimbledon to Ipswich for \u00a34.5m.\" </p> <p>Bulgarian international Ilian Kiriakov is poised to join Airdrie after being released by Aberdeen at the end of last season. The 33-year-old utility player spent four years at Pittodrie.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Christian Ziege has criticised Middlesbrough for holding up his move to Liverpool. Boro are holding out for a higher fee than that which is laid down in the contract,\" he said. \"That to me is sinister. I'm in England to play football, not for a legal battle.\"</p> <p>Blackburn have signed French Under-21 international Kaba Diawara on loan for the rest of the season from Paris St Germain with a view to a permanent move.

      "body": "<p>The telecommunications sector - once the rarefied domain of public servants - has been turned on its head by young, high-earning executives whose enormous salaries and bonuses reflect the explosion of internet and mobile handset growth. </p> <p>Paul Chisholm, the low-profile American who has been running Colt Telecom for the past eight years, rang up a cool \u00a315.2m in 1999, and that salary, bonus and options package did not include the \u00a3113m in share options he has not yet exercised. </p> <p>Mr Chisholm, who once studied to be a Roman Catholic priest, shocked the market earlier this month when he announced that he was going to quit and return to the US. The 52-year-old's record of taking Colt from a $100m idea in 1992 to a \u00a312bn company today has left many shareholders praying his successor is able to make the same mark. </p> <p>However, the high salaries at UK telecommunications companies do not stop at Colt's London offices. </p> <p>Moving west to Newbury, the world's biggest wireless company, Vodafone, has had a battle with shareholders over plans to bring its executive remuneration up to a global standard that will ensure top employees will not be snatched by competitors. </p> <p>Chris Gent, the chief executive of Vodafone, received a \u00a310m bonus payment - not counted in the Guardian-Inbucon survey as it was paid at the start of the new financial year - for the successful takeover of German mobile rival Mannesmann. </p> <p>The amount, which is relatively small in global terms, outraged shareholders and forced the board to issue a statement saying it would not happen again. Overshadowing Mr Gent's bonus, however, was the 1999 remuneration of two Americans of Asian descent employed by Vodafone. Arun Sarin, still a non-executive director of Vodafone, was paid a total of \u00a321.2m in 1999. </p> <p>Mr Sarin, 45, was chief executive of Vodafone's US-Asia Pacific operations. </p> <p>He joined the company from Airtouch Communications, which he ran before it was acquired by Vodafone. </p> <p>Mr Sarin was a significant player in several multibillion-dollar deals - including the AirTouch merger, Vodafone's hostile bid for Mannesmann and the creation of Verizon Wireless, which was formed when Bell Atlantic and Vodafone merged their American mobile businesses. </p> <p>His remuneration largely comprises of share options paid following Vodafone's takeover of AirTouch. Mr Sarin now heads the American data provider, InfoSpace, which he joined in April. </p> <p>Mohan Gyani, the former chief financial officer of AirTouch, is now president of AT&amp;T Wireless. He received \u00a316.2m in 1999 on his departure with two-thirds of that amount an option payout. </p> <p>Hans Snook, the chief executive of British mobile operator Orange, is one member of the telcos club whose salary is in that league but not listed. He is understood to have received several hefty payments - possibly totalling as much as \u00a350m - as his company was first taken over by Mannesmann, later by Vodafone and now by France Telecom.</p>",

Paul Chisholm, the low-profile American who has been running Colt Telecom for the past eight years, rang up a cool \u00a315.2m in 1999, and that salary, bonus and options package did not include the \u00a3113m in share options he has not yet exercised. Mr Chisholm, who once studied to be a Roman Catholic priest, shocked the market earlier this month when he announced that he was going to quit and return to the US. The 52-year-old's record of taking Colt from a $100m idea in 1992 to a \u00a312bn company today has left many shareholders praying his successor is able to make the same mark. However, the high salaries at UK telecommunications companies do not stop at Colt's London offices. Moving west to Newbury, the world's biggest wireless company, Vodafone, has had a battle with shareholders over plans to bring its executive remuneration up to a global standard that will ensure top employees will not be snatched by competitors. Chris Gent, the chief executive of Vodafone, received a \u00a310m bonus payment - not counted in the Guardian-Inbucon survey as it was paid at the start of the new financial year - for the successful takeover of German mobile rival Mannesmann. The amount, which is relatively small in global terms, outraged shareholders and forced the board to issue a statement saying it would not happen again. Overshadowing Mr Gent's bonus, however, was the 1999 remuneration of two Americans of Asian descent employed by Vodafone. Arun Sarin, still a non-executive director of Vodafone, was paid a total of \u00a321.2m in 1999. Mr Sarin, 45, was chief executive of Vodafone's US-Asia Pacific operations. He joined the company from Airtouch Communications, which he ran before it was acquired by Vodafone. Mr Sarin was a significant player in several multibillion-dollar deals - including the AirTouch merger, Vodafone's hostile bid for Mannesmann and the creation of Verizon Wireless, which was formed when Bell Atlantic and Vodafone merged their American mobile businesses. His remuneration largely comprises of share options paid following Vodafone's takeover of AirTouch. Mr Sarin now heads the American data provider, InfoSpace, which he joined in April. Mohan Gyani, the former chief financial officer of AirTouch, is now president of AT&amp;T Wireless. He received \u00a316.2m in 1999 on his departure with two-thirds of that amount an option payout. Hans Snook, the chief executive of British mobile operator Orange, is one member of the telcos club whose salary is in that league but not listed. He is understood to have received several hefty payments - possibly totalling as much as \u00a350m - as his company was first taken over by Mannesmann, later by Vodafone and now by France Telecom.",

The health experts will tell you that it can improve mobility, ease back pain and arthritis, and reduce high blood pressure and hypertension. Gentle, weightless, soothing and therapeutic - yet invigorating. Wonderful. </p> <p>There is only one catch: to get all the benefits of swimming, you have to swim properly. Or at last half-properly. Paddling, gasping and splashing along like some demented Labrador - fingers apart, chin in the air, ears cocked, spine twisting violently upwards - really isn't all that good for you. And you would be amazed by how many people really do swim badly: visit your local swimming baths and have a look. Dolphins they ain't. The bulk of lunchtime lappers have pretty poor technique, be it the result of anxiety, lack of body awareness, lack of control or the age-old fear of getting one's hair wet during office hours. </p> <p>But help is at hand. For those keen to learn to swim properly, with maximum therapeutic benefits, there is now a method that combines the Alexander technique (good for posture) with modern swimming techniques. Telma Koorlind took her first lesson - in fact, it was also her first swimming lesson - last July at the age of 63. She did it, at her GP's suggestion, to ease serious back pain brought on by years of lifting and carrying heavy loads - an inevitable part of her busy catering business. Since then, she says, she has not only gained a better back but \"a whole new lease of life\". </p> <p>The technique, known as the Shaw method, is the brainchild of swimming teacher and Alexander technique instructor Steven Shaw. A former competitive swimmer, Shaw developed the approach with his wife, Limor. The couple say the method is aimed at helping people rediscover a sense of balance, freedom and body awareness in the water. </p> <p>For Telma Koorlind, the Shaw method has become part of the daily routine. \"It feels like doing yoga in the water,\" she says. </p> <p>Harriet Shapiro, a New York journalist, is another big fan of the method - she had swum all her life and considered herself an accomplished swimmer, but took a series of lessons with Shaw simply out of interest. She was surprised to find that she didn't swim as well as she had thought. \"I discovered that my arms were tight, that I didn't use my legs enough, didn't breathe easily and twisted my neck. It was a revelation,\" she says. \"I learned to treat the water not as something to fight but to go with. Now, I swim and breathe far more easily. And I developed a sense of naturalness in the water that I didn't have before.\" </p> <p>Shaw says that, like Shapiro, many people take their swimming technique for granted and don't think about what they are doing in the water. If they did, they might notice a few problems: improper breathing, kicking one leg higher than the other one during breaststroke or a kick out of sync with the arms, for example. </p> <p>Sloppy or mindless swimming not only limits the benefits and enjoyment that can be gained from time in the water, but it can also aggravate old injuries and cause neck, shoulder and back problems, according to Shaw. \"In particular, swimming with the face held out of the water reduces the efficiency of movements and puts undue strain on the muscles of the neck and lower back, which can lead to damage of the spine's interior facet joints,\" he says. </p> <p>Paul Massey, physiotherapist for the British Olympic swimming team, agrees: \"Swimming is a very technique-dependent activity. The majority of people put efforts into the wrong patterns, and, if they do it repeatedly, they will develop strains and injuries.\" </p> <p>Most swimmers, Shaw says, tend to overstrain when they should be relaxing, and ease off when they should be using more force. In the crawl, for example, many apply effort above the water when they should be working harder under the water. In the breaststroke, they tend to rely on their arms instead of gaining their main propulsion from their legs. </p> <p>While in the water, people also tend to interfere with their natural breathing process, either because they are anxious or because they overestimate the amount of air required. \"I often witness people sucking in large quantities of air, as if they were about to swim a whole length under water,\" says Shaw </p> <p>If too much air is inhaled, there isn't enough time to exhale it all before the next inhalation, and this causes breathlessness and hyperventilation. \"In both the crawl and the breaststroke, inhalation ought to be smooth and gentle. Breathing should be focused on the exhalation with the face remaining in the water until all the air is expelled. Then, simply raising the head and opening the mouth should provide enough oxygen to continue,\" says Shaw. </p> <p>\"I used to thrash around a lot and use a lot of energy without getting very far,\" says Chris Tomlineson, a photo librarian who took some lessons with Shaw. \"Now my swimming is a lot smoother and I developed a lot of stamina.\" The benefits extend beyond the pool, adds Tomli neson, who has cerebral palsy. \"The lessons enabled me to learn how to relax not only in the water but in my daily life as well. I feel I can deal with things better.\" </p> <p>Because many of the wrong swimming patterns stem from anxiety in the water - either conscious or not - the Shaw method concentrates first on teaching people to let go, be quiet and let the water support them. Once they are at home in the water and have developed a good sense of balance and positioning, they work on their breathing, movements, rhythm, sequences and intensity in all swimming styles. </p> <p>The Shaw method is designed to teach people to swim well while enjoying the water rather than simply swim faster or better - to focus on the process rather than the result, Shaw says. \"We are trying to make swimming mindful. It's exercise, but it's much more. Swimming should be playful, reflective, meditative - a break from our fast and cluttered lives.\" </p> <p>\"Shaw's method is very effective in improving body alignment and body awareness in the water,\" says Massey. \"It helps elite athletes to be aware of where they are in the water and recreational swimmers to avoid discomfort and sore muscles, and be more absorbed in what they are doing.\" </p> <p>The drawback, however, is that the method requires one-to-one or small group tuition, which may not be practical for teaching school children, for example, and may not be accessible to everyone, as John Lawton, director of education with the Amateur Swimming Association, points out. Lessons with the Shaw method are also expensive (a one-hour private lesson costs between \u00a330 and \u00a355 depending of the teacher and location). </p> <p>But the devoted are adamant that it is a good long-term investment. \"Whatever I invested in my swimming was the best investment I have ever made,\" says Koorlind. \"My back improved no end and my nerves aren't so brittle.

      "body": "<p><strong> Persistent moles</strong></p> <p> <strong> Q </strong>In recent years, doctors at my local hospital have removed 10 moles they suspected might be skin cancer. Only two turned out to be malignant, both non-life-threatening basal cell carcinomas. This has left me with unpleasant visible scarring. Now doctors want to remove two more suspect moles. Given that eight out of 10 previous removals were unnecessary, I have asked if they could take a small biopsy unlikely to lead to scarring. Then, if analysis shows evidence of cancer, the rest of the mole and surrounding tissue could be removed in a follow-up operation. </p> <p>The doctors say this is \"not possible\". It is, apparently, their policy to remove the whole of any suspect mole and all surrounding tissue. They say that taking a small sample might miss the cancerous element and could depress any cancerous cells downwards, encouraging invasive body growth. Are the doctors right? Is their policy standard practice for identifying potential skin cancers? I want any suspect moles investigated, but I am not happy that the removal of moles about 4mm in diameter have left me with 10 12mm by 30mm scars. Doctors admit that I am likely to need many more exploratory removals. Fair enough, but I don't want to be covered in scars if I can possibly avoid it. </p> <p><strong> A </strong> You've got two different and unrelated skin problems. Basal cell cancers, also known as rodent ulcers, are usually readily identifiable by doctors and do need to be removed by cutting, scraping, freezing or burning. You also seem to have a lot of moles that need watching to ensure that you aren't developing a melanoma. Melanomas don't kill you if you catch them early but rapidly become more dangerous as they extend deeper into the skin. That's why all your doctors have erred on the side of caution - any number of skin scars has to be better than missing a treatable melanoma. You could ask to have all your moles photographed regularly so that any changes could be measured. Also look out for changes of colour and size in moles, and any itching, bleeding or crusting which can be early signs of melanoma. </p> <p><strong> Boozing and dozing</strong></p> <p> <strong> Q </strong>Is there such a condition as \"alcoholic narcolepsy\"?

      "bodyText": "Persistent moles Q In recent years, doctors at my local hospital have removed 10 moles they suspected might be skin cancer. Only two turned out to be malignant, both non-life-threatening basal cell carcinomas. This has left me with unpleasant visible scarring. Now doctors want to remove two more suspect moles. Given that eight out of 10 previous removals were unnecessary, I have asked if they could take a small biopsy unlikely to lead to scarring. Then, if analysis shows evidence of cancer, the rest of the mole and surrounding tissue could be removed in a follow-up operation. The doctors say this is \"not possible\". It is, apparently, their policy to remove the whole of any suspect mole and all surrounding tissue. They say that taking a small sample might miss the cancerous element and could depress any cancerous cells downwards, encouraging invasive body growth. Are the doctors right? Is their policy standard practice for identifying potential skin cancers? I want any suspect moles investigated, but I am not happy that the removal of moles about 4mm in diameter have left me with 10 12mm by 30mm scars. Doctors admit that I am likely to need many more exploratory removals. Fair enough, but I don't want to be covered in scars if I can possibly avoid it. A You've got two different and unrelated skin problems. Basal cell cancers, also known as rodent ulcers, are usually readily identifiable by doctors and do need to be removed by cutting, scraping, freezing or burning. You also seem to have a lot of moles that need watching to ensure that you aren't developing a melanoma. Melanomas don't kill you if you catch them early but rapidly become more dangerous as they extend deeper into the skin. That's why all your doctors have erred on the side of caution - any number of skin scars has to be better than missing a treatable melanoma. You could ask to have all your moles photographed regularly so that any changes could be measured. Also look out for changes of colour and size in moles, and any itching, bleeding or crusting which can be early signs of melanoma. Boozing and dozing Q Is there such a condition as \"alcoholic narcolepsy\"? Of course alcohol can put people to sleep eventually. The question is how little alcohol it takes to put somebody to sleep before such a condition could be called a medical problem? In my case, that can be as little as eight units of alcohol depending on physical environment, the company I'm in and whether I mix kinds of alcoholic drinks.

      "body": "<p>It's a form of medicine that has been around for nearly 200 years, with advocates as diverse as John D Rockefeller, Mahatma Gandhi, Tina Turner and the royal family. But even though homeopathy is used by more than 20% of people and is available on the NHS, no one knows how it works. And yet it does seem to work. A research paper in last week's British Medical Journal shows that out of 50 people with nasal allergies, 28% improved with homeopathy compared with 3% given a placebo. While symptoms of blocked, runny or itchy nose, eye irritation and sneezing got better over four weeks in both groups, those on homeopathic treatment had better nasal air flow and could therefore breathe more easily. </p> <p>Dr David Reilly of the Glasgow Homeopathy Hospital, one of the paper's authors, hopes his results will encourage doctors to look again at the evidence supporting homeopathy. \"Despite these findings, and the fact that there have now been more than 180 trials of homeopathy - of which 70% are positive - there will still be doctors who believe religiously that it cannot work and therefore it does not work,\" he says. </p> <p>Homeopathy was invented by Samuel Hahnemann, a German doctor who was so horrified by the cures available in the late 18th century, such as blood letting and arsenic, that he gave up his traditional practice. Using drugs such as belladonna, he experimented on himself and announced a new medical principle (based on the practice of the ancient Greeks) of \"that which makes sick shall heal\". </p> <p>Homeopathy, from a combination of the Greek words for similar and suffering, works on the basis that like cures like. Cutting onions, for example, makes your nose and eyes run and your throat sore. So what better treatment for a cold, in homeopathic terms, than Allium cepa, a remedy made from onion? Homeopaths cite parallels in conventional medicine to support this concept - irradiation causes cancer but also treats it, and digitalis can both cause and cure irregular heart rates. But while conventional medicine gives doses you can measure, homeopathy does not. Homeopathy believes that only a tiny amount of like cures like and uses medicines that contain minute doses of the therapeutic agent. The medicines, from plants, minerals, metals and even poisons, are serially diluted in alcohol and water, up to many thousands of times. Each time they are diluted they are vigorously shaken and each dilution is thought to make the remedy stronger. </p> <p>Remedies come in various forms, often as tablets. The problem that critics have is that after the 12th centesimal dilution, no molecules of the original substance can be found in these remedies. A biochemical analysis shows only water and alcohol. How, they ask, can homeopathy work when its remedies contain no active agents? </p> <p>\"Many people say there is no plausible mechanism for it to work and that trials are a waste of money,\" says Dr Reilly. \"Now if people tell you there's a unicorn at the end of your garden you can invoke plausibility and refuse to believe it. But if over 200 years people keep saying there's a unicorn in your garden then it might be at least worth having a look.\" </p> <p>Reilly and others believe that homeopathic remedies are active because the water and alcohol remember, in some way, the original ingredient. \"There may be some imprinting of information from the starting material in the first dilution,\" he says. </p> <p>Regardless of how effective the remedies are, homeopathy's growing popularity is partly due to the consultation process. Practitioners may take over an hour seeing patients and specifically ask about emotions and life stresses. Dr Reilly says: \"If a patient comes in with asthma then we ask what was going on in their life when it started. They may tell you that they had some devastating grief and their health went right down and they got asthma. Part of the prescribing may be a remedy for what we call illness from grief. Extracting the history from a patient is quite therapeutic for them - it shows we are interested not just in the diagnosis but how the disease affects them.\" So therapeutic is the consultation that for years it, rather than the remedies, was credited with making patients better. But a study of more than 100 homeopathy trials, published in the Lancet in 1997, found that the consultation alone could not explain homeopathy's clinical effects. </p> <p>Remedies are tailored to individuals to take account of the person's experience of their disease - what time of the day or during which weather conditions their symptoms are worst. Rather than attacking the agent responsible, they are said to provoke the body's own defence mechanisms. Symptoms are matched with remedies from the homeopathic materia medica and patients may also be told to make lifestyle and dietary changes. Patients are usually reviewed between two and six weeks when their practitioner may stop treatment and monitor progress. </p> <p>Homeopathy's underlying tenet, which rankles with many doctors, is that there are no incurable diseases for homeopathy, only incurable patients. But homeopathy does not claim to clear any mechanical obstructions or fractures. These, they admit, need surgical treatment. Most registered homeopaths would not treat patients with cancer without conventional help. There are more than 1,000 doctors and at least 1,500 non-doctors in the UK practising homeopathy. </p> <p>Francis Truherz trained as a homeopath and has practised for 10 years, mostly in NHS clinics in London. \"Sometimes patients come to see me without seeing their GP and I will strongly advise them to see a doctor. I may not always get it right, but then doctors can also miss diagnoses,\" he says. \"If someone phoned me and said they thought they had meningitis I'd tell them to phone for an ambulance.\" </p> <p>As with conventional medicines, homeopathy is increasingly available over the counter. \"It's fine to try them - you can't overdose on them as you can with aspirin,\" says Truherz. \"If your symptoms persist, see your doctor or registered homeopath. It's really matching the prescription to the patient that makes the remedy homeopathic.\" He advises people to use products from one of six licensed manufacturers (such as Helios or Ainsworths). Homeopathic medicines must be taken in a clean mouth (no eating for 20 minutes before and no toothpaste or cigarettes) and he advises no coffee for a month once treatment starts because it can neutralise remedies. </p> <p>Andrew Vickers, researcher and author of the ABC of Complementary Medicine (BMJ Publishing Group), says that it's still as easy to argue against homeopathy as to argue for it. For a start, he says, there's enormous variation in remedies and practice, with some homeopaths using low dilutions and others high. Some only give one remedy at a time, others give combinations. In France they may prepare a remedy by macerating it in alcohol for two days, in Germany by leaving it in alcohol for 12 days. \"We did a study where we gave two homeopaths a list of symptoms and said is it plausible to give this medicine? There was only mediocre agreement,\" says Vickers. \"If you did an equivalent study asking doctors if it was plausible to give aspirin for headaches, they would almost all say yes.\" </p> <p>Vickers is also concerned that so much of homeopathy's knowledge base is unvalidated. \"Homeopathic repertories tell practitioners how to prescribe on the basis of patients' symptoms. But some symptoms are utterly bizarre, such as 'erections during supper' and 'dreams of writing on a dirty table and the paper becoming smeared'. </p> <p>\"This information is unreferenced, it's just there. It comes from 'provings' that involve healthy people being given potential homeopathic remedies and then recording and reporting everything that happens to them. The remedy and the recorded 'symptoms' are then entered into the repertory. We analysed some provings that were done and people recorded 'thoughts of hedgehogs' and 'felt bored during lectures'. There is no evidence that these potential remedies caused these symptoms.\" </p> <p>Vickers estimates that there are around 2,000 homeopathic remedies but believes that most homeopaths use a core of 30 or 40 that they are confident work for groups of symptoms. Even so there are no studies that show how these drugs can work. \"It's all highly implausible,\" he says. \"A new cancer drug would be similar to an old cancer drug and there would be some work in animal models so you could believe it could work, and a clinical trial using patients would be part of a larger picture of evidence. With homeopathy there are no animal models. With homeopathy you need more evidence than normal to show it works because the clinical trials are all you have.

      "bodyText": "European veterinary experts today voted to reduce the scope of a ban on English pig exports to East Anglia, where the outbreak of swine fever was first detected. \"The ban stays in place, but the reference to England is replaced by the three counties of Essex, Suffolk and Norfolk,\" an EU official said after a meeting of EU senior veterinary officials. Swine fever, a contagious virus which is not dangerous to humans, has been found in pigs at five different locations in East Anglia. The discovery prompted the European Commission to impose a ban on all English exports on August 14. The government's chief veterinary officer attended the talks in Brussels amid hopes the spread of swine fever has been contained. Yesterday it was announced that four more farms had been by cleared by scientists investigating the outbreak. The Ministry of Agriculture said that the results of tests at two farms in Suffolk, one in Kent and one in Lincolnshire had all proved negative. Seven farms have been cleared since the disease was first reported at the beginning of this month. But there are still tests to be completed on about 30 more farms and more suspected cases may be reported. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, had warned that there was no justification for Brussels to ban English pork and bacon following the first outbreak of swine fever in the UK for 14 years. Pig farmers had hoped the EU experts would reduce the scope of the present ban to August 31 if the government could show that the outbreak had been contained. Earlier Mr Brown told Radio 4's Today programme that he did not want to \"set deadlines\" on resolving the issue. But he added: \"We are doing everything we can to eliminate this as quickly as possible.\"",

      "bodyText": "Shell is planning a great march into China and could spend up to $1bn (\u00a3667m) buying equity stakes in two of of the county's three top oil conglomerates. The Anglo-Dutch company's commitment to the Asia-Pacific region was underlined yesterday when it applied for official clearance to buy the biggest oil and gas company in New Zealand. Flushed with cash from crude prices riding at a 10-year high, Shell has already submitted a bid to buy Woodside Petroleum in Australia and yesterday won two more exploration permits to drill off the coast of that country. Officials from the London head office of Shell confirmed that it was holding discussions with China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec) and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). Both sets of talks involve taking stakes in forthcoming initial public offerings. Chinese officials said Shell was planning to invest up to $400m in CNOOC and is considering a similar move with regard to Sinopec, China's second largest oil group. Sinopec plans an IPO in Hong Kong and New York next month to raise $3bn, the same amount as the country's biggest player, PetroChina, received in April. An IPO planned by CNOOC had to be shelved after criticism of the price but is expected to return to the market in early 2001. BP Amoco paid $620m for a 20% stake in PetroChina and has been looking at making a similar investment in Sinopec. That company would give Shell access to China's massive retail business, allowing it to sell its own branded petrol. CNOOC and Shell are already cooperating closely on the Xijiang oil fields in the South China Sea, 150km from Hong Kong. Analysts said the move into China made sense. But they warned Shell against thinking that participating in any IPO would lead to the Chinese government looking favourably on any other of the company's expansion plans. Shell is keen to establish itself as a key figure in China's gas sector, which is expected to boom in future years. The Anglo-Dutch group has also applied to the New Zealand commerce commission to acquire Fletcher Challenge Energy (FCE), which has a market capitalisation of NZ$2.5bn (\u00a3753m). But it could face competition from BP Amoco and Chevron, which have indicated an interest in FCE, and it is likely to face a tough time with industry regulators because of its already dominant position in New Zealand. A deal would \"strengthen our interest in a region that, with the recovery of Asian Pacific economies, offers significant opportunities for growth,\" said Shell New Zealand chairman Ed Johnson. There has been much speculation about the future of Fletcher Challenge's oil and gas arm following a decision to hive off its companies involved in forests and building. The oil major might be forced to take over all Fletcher business interests but would then sell the non-exploration and production parts, including its stakes in Challenge Petroleum and the New Zealand Refining Company. Shell claims already to provide up to 57% of the country's total energy needs through its 18.75% stake in the Maui oil and gas field and a 50% holding in the Kapuni gas field. Shell shares finished the day down 1p at 585.5p.",

      "bodyText": "Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson today held talks with senior security advisers to set up a mediation process to end the loyalist paramilitary feud. Army and police chiefs met Mr Mandelson for a two-hour meeting at Hillsborough Castle, in the wake of a series of gun attacks in various parts of the province which were linked to the vicious infighting between the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association. While the Shankill Road hotspot remained quiet today, shots were fired at houses in Londonderry, east Belfast and the neighbouring north Antrim villages of Dervock and Portballintrae. A car was also damaged in Coleraine. Nobody was hurt, but the death of two men in north Belfast yesterday meant the peace - enforced by the first round-the-clock troop patrols since 1998 - is an uneasy one. Mr Mandelson and his security chiefs made no comment after their meeting, but it is understood behind the scenes attempts were being made to get representatives of the two rival organisations to negotiate some sort of truce. Without talks, all sides fear more deaths. Gary McMichael, leader of the Ulster Democratic Party, the UDA's political wing, called for a halt to the shootings. He said. \"Those involved should take stock of the implications of continued internecine violence. \"Ultimately the loyalist community are the losers in this feud.\" Billy Hutchinson of the Progressive Unionist Party, the UVF's political wing, said mediation talks would have to get under way at some stage. But he did not expect a start to be made just yet. He said: \"No matter how many people die, sooner or later people will talk. We have to find a mediator who is respected on both sides.\" A man escaped injury when a number of shots were fired through the windows of a house at Greystone Crescent in Dervock, Co Antrim. At Portballintray, Co Antrim, a seven-year-old boy and five-year-old girl escaped injury, but a man suffered shock when shots were fired through the living room window of a house at Causeway View. A car was damaged outside a house in an attack in Coleraine, Co Londonderry, and shots were also fired into an unoccupied house at Lincoln Court in the Waterside area of Londonderry. The Progressive Unionist Party, which speaks for the UVF, said the homes all belonged to members of the party. There was also a gun attack on a house at Uniondale Street in east Belfast. No one was inside and police said they were investigating the motive. It is understood that detectives are questioning at least five men after weapons were seized in north and south Belfast, but it is believed none are being held in connection with the murders of Jackie Coulter and Bobby Mahood, the two men gunned down by the UVF on the Crumlin Road yesterday. Mr Mandelson was urged today to return to prison leading loyalists given early release under the Good Friday Agreement but seen parading with paramilitary organisations in recent days. Conservative party chairman Michael Ancram, a former Northern Ireland minister, called for some of the terrorists released on licence to be returned to prison. He said: \"I think that the credibility of the peace process depends on Peter Mandelson now showing that what he has said he would do he is now prepared to do. \"I think that the evidence is there that Johnny Adair and Michael Stone have been engaging in naked displays of paramilitarism, that this is in breach of their licences and if he wants to give an indication that he is not prepared to see the sort of lawlessness we have seen, then I think they should be returned to prison immediately. Mr Mandelson gave a warning last night that if any prisoner released under the Good Friday Agreement was found to be involved in violence he would not hesitate to return him to jail.",

      "body": "<p>Long-awaited plans to give 2m leaseholders more rights to manage their homes or buy them outright were unveiled by the government yesterday.</p> <p>The draft bill for leasehold reform creates a commonhold tenure, which will finally make it possible in England and Wales to own a flat outright.</p> <p>The measures will effectively serve notice on landlords who abuse the system by levying high service charges and undertaking expensive building work without consultation.</p> <p>At present there are two ways to own flats: freehold, which comes close to absolute ownership, and leasehold, which confers ownership for a specified period.</p> <p>Under leasehold rules, people typically buy a property with a lease of up to 125 years, but as this period reduces, the property's value can depreciate. The law allows freeholds to be purchased only with the backing of two thirds of the leaseholders in a block. The process can be expensive, complicated and time consuming for solicitors to unravel.</p> <p>The draft bill provides an alternative to leasehold, giving people an optional freehold interest in their property, or \"unit\".</p> <p>It also gives the 2m leaseholders in England and Wales, typically flat owners, a combination of the security of freehold ownership and a voluntary \"right to manage\" a property.</p> <p>Unit holders will be able to form a private limited company, or commonhold association, if there is consent among all the leaseholders to surrender their leases.</p> <p>The association's membership will be restricted to the unit holders within the development and will be registered at Companies House and the land registry. The association will work under guidelines prescribed by the lord chancellor.</p> <p>The draft bill gives leaseholders of local authorities and registered social landlords greater rights to be consulted over improvements to their property and to object to the amount their landlord charges for such work.</p> <p>Flat owners and MPs have waged a long campaign for reform of the leasehold system because of abuses by unscrupulous landlords.</p> <p>But Archie Norman, shadow environment secretary, accused the government of dragging its feet over the reform.

      "bodyText": "Long-awaited plans to give 2m leaseholders more rights to manage their homes or buy them outright were unveiled by the government yesterday. The draft bill for leasehold reform creates a commonhold tenure, which will finally make it possible in England and Wales to own a flat outright. The measures will effectively serve notice on landlords who abuse the system by levying high service charges and undertaking expensive building work without consultation. At present there are two ways to own flats: freehold, which comes close to absolute ownership, and leasehold, which confers ownership for a specified period. Under leasehold rules, people typically buy a property with a lease of up to 125 years, but as this period reduces, the property's value can depreciate. The law allows freeholds to be purchased only with the backing of two thirds of the leaseholders in a block. The process can be expensive, complicated and time consuming for solicitors to unravel. The draft bill provides an alternative to leasehold, giving people an optional freehold interest in their property, or \"unit\". It also gives the 2m leaseholders in England and Wales, typically flat owners, a combination of the security of freehold ownership and a voluntary \"right to manage\" a property. Unit holders will be able to form a private limited company, or commonhold association, if there is consent among all the leaseholders to surrender their leases. The association's membership will be restricted to the unit holders within the development and will be registered at Companies House and the land registry. The association will work under guidelines prescribed by the lord chancellor. The draft bill gives leaseholders of local authorities and registered social landlords greater rights to be consulted over improvements to their property and to object to the amount their landlord charges for such work. Flat owners and MPs have waged a long campaign for reform of the leasehold system because of abuses by unscrupulous landlords. But Archie Norman, shadow environment secretary, accused the government of dragging its feet over the reform. Critics also said it failed to scrap a legal concept called marriage value, which allows landlords to charge leaseholders wildly inflated prices to buy their freeholds. Despite a variety of reforms over the past 30 years, the system is widely perceived as unfair to leaseholders who have paid freehold prices for their flats. There is also evidence of widespread exploitation by rogue landlords. Last night Richard Williams, vice chairman of the Federation of Private Residents Associations, said: \"One big disappointment with the bill is the extreme difficulty it poses for converting existing long leaseholds into commonhold. \"The government has said you will have to get 100% consent from the leaseholders in the property. In many cases of larger blocks of flats this will be practically impossible to achieve.\" His organisation was also anxious to ensure that the reforms did not make the existing residents' owned and managed leaseholds unmanageable, with groups being able to mount coups within blocks. The government has allowed two months of consultation on the draft bill. It is hoped that the bill itself will reach the House of Lords before the end of the year and become law by next spring.

Those rumoured to have been lined up include Jake Lloyd, the nine-year-old who played Anakin; Liam Aiken, who played Susan Sarandon's son in Stepmom; and Haley Joel Osment, the Oscar-nominated 11-year-old star of The Sixth Sense who said recently: \"I'd love to play Harry. You can put the word out and I'll be working on my accent.\"</p> <p>The casting process - which looked at 40,000 applications after a single BBC Newsround appeal - was so lengthy, it apparently led the casting director, Susie Figgis, to pull out in frustration. The director Steven Spielberg reportedly withdrew after Rowling vetoed his plan to cast Haley Joel on the grounds that Harry should be British.</p> <p>Last night the film's director, Christopher Columbus, admitted: \"We saw so many enormously talented kids in the search for Harry. The process was intense and there were times when we felt we would never find an individual who embodied the complex spirit and depth of Harry Potter. Then, Dan walked into the room and we all knew we had found Harry.\"</p> <p><b> Unknowns</b><br></p> <p>Columbus was equally effusive about Emma Watson, 10, and Rupert Grint, 11, the unknowns who have only appeared in school plays and were picked to play Harry's sidekicks, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. \"[They] are perfect for the roles of Hermione and Ron,\" he said. \"I couldn't be happier to begin work with such talented, inspiring young actors.\"</p> <p>Rowling - believed to have had strong control over the casting - also gave Harry her approval. \"Having seen Dan Radcliffe screen test,\" she said, \"I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry.\"</p> <p>But while the relief and excitement was palpable yesterday, there was strong awareness of the need to protect the children.

Last night one former child star, Jack Wild, who played the Artful Dodger in Oliver!, warned Daniel would need to \"not take anything seriously\" to avoid being drawn in by adulation.</p> <p>\"It's very difficult,\" he said. \"I was just a working class boy but I was a millionaire before I was 17. You begin to realise you're responsible for everyone's jobs around you, and you think you have power and control, which is very corrupting. You crave fame - but it comes at a very great price.\"</p> <p>But there was a less gloomy prognosis for Daniel's future from the director John Boorman, who recently directed him in the upcoming film of John Le Carre's novel The Tailor of Panama, in which he plays the son of the tailor alongside Geoffrey Rush and Jamie Lee Curtis.</p> <p>Describing him as \"a lovely kid\" he said: \"The most important thing when you're casting children is to make sure you cast the parents, and his parents are excellent people. They're aware of the pressures but they're also very protective, without being pushy. I like them very much.\"</p> <p><b>Coping with fame, fortune and failure</b><br></p> <p><b> Jack Wild</b></p> <p>As the Artful Dodger in the 1968 film of Lionel Bart's musical Oliver!, Wild won fame at the age of 15 - and by 17 had a couple of million-dollar contracts and his own US TV show. But he also had the start of a drink probem that dogged him until his mid-30s. \"I was never really sober. I just topped myself up every day,\" he explained recently. \"There have been some low points, certainly.\"</p> <p>These included the breakdown of his marriage to his Welsh wife, Gaynor, and the decline in his career, which largely centres on pantos. After a period living at home with his father, Wild, 47, now lives with his actress girlfriend whom he met four years ago in Jack and the Beanstalk at Worthing.</p> <p><b> Drew Barrymore</b></p> <p>Barrymore, now 25, was the epitome of cuteness when she starred at the age of six in Steven Spielberg's ET. But at seven she began pouring Baileys on her ice cream, by 10 she was partying on wine, beer and dope, and at 12 she was snorting six lines of cocaine a day. By 14, she had come out as an alcoholic, gone through rehab and attempted suicide; at 15, she had filed for \"legal emancipation\" from her mother; at 17, she had posed naked; and at 19 she married a Welsh bar owner. It lasted six weeks.</p> <p>Hers, however, is ultimately a success story, for in an astonishing turnaround she has become a darling of Hollywood once more. As she recently said: \"I didn't think I'd live past 25, but I've slowed down.\"</p> <p>Having reinvented herself as a winsome girl-next-door, she now commands $2.5m a movie following hits such as The Wedding Singer, Batman Forever and Scream. She also runs her own production company, Flower Films, and is filming the remake of Charlie's Angels with Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu.</p> <p><b> Mark Lester</b></p> <p>Now 41, the star of the film Oliver! won fame at the age of 10. By 14, was earning \u00a3100,000 a year as he starred in an average of two films a year.</p> <p>But, as puberty beckoned, the roles dried up. There seemed little to do but spend his newly released money: on his 18th birthday he was handed \u00a370,000 and went wild. \"I bought myself a Ferrari and it was party, party, party,\" he has said. \"It was terrific fun at first. I tried everything that was going, drink, dope, acid - whatever was on offer. For a teenage boy, it was like a dream come true.\"</p> <p>But it soon turned sour: the \u00a370,000 took just two years to get through, and his three-year relationship disintegrated when his girlfriend tired of his dissolute lifestyle.</p> <p>It was a wake-up call. He ended up in rehab, began to keep fit, and, at 28, went back to school to gain the A levels required to study osteopathy. Now married with young children, he runs a successful osteopathy and acupuncture clinic in Cheltenham.</p> <p><b> Macaulay Culkin</b></p> <p>At the age of nine, the star of Home Alone became the most successful child actor since Shirley Temple, garnering an estimated $40m (\u00a325m) fortune.</p> <p>But at 13, after a series of flops and his parents' custody battle, he refused to act again, instead dyeing his hair blue, spraying graffiti on his parents' apartment walls and playing truant.</p> <p>At 16, he took his parents - whom Hollywood insiders claim were living out their dreams through him - to court and wrested control of his fortune from them.</p> <p>At 17, he was married to fellow former child star Rachel Miner in what appeared to be a further fit of rebellion. It emerged last month that the couple have separated.</p> <p>He has hardly worked for the past six years. But he recently made a tentative move towards a badly needed comeback by auditioning to appear in a play in London's West End.</p> <p><b> Jodie Foster</b></p> <p>Foster appears to be the exception that proves the rule. From the age of three she was starring in commercials and soon became the family's breadwinner. She has appeared in 33 films. Yet she insists that regular work, her education and her mother's constant support, protected her. \"It's not as if I was a child star,\" she has said. \"I was a child actress, which is something completely different.\"</p> <p>Now 37, and a single mother with a baby son, she has become the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning a reputed \u00a310m per movie and winning Oscars for The Accused and Silence of the Lambs. She is also a director but suggests motherhood is her greatest achievement.</p> <p><b>Useful links: </b><br><a href=\"http://www.bloomsbury.com/harrypotter/\" target=\"_new\">Harry Potter (Bloomsbury - UK)</a> <br><a href=\" http://harrypotter.warnerbros.com/cmp/main-fr.html\" target=\"_NEW\"> Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Warner Bros)</a></p>",

By 14, she had come out as an alcoholic, gone through rehab and attempted suicide; at 15, she had filed for \"legal emancipation\" from her mother; at 17, she had posed naked; and at 19 she married a Welsh bar owner. It lasted six weeks. Hers, however, is ultimately a success story, for in an astonishing turnaround she has become a darling of Hollywood once more. As she recently said: \"I didn't think I'd live past 25, but I've slowed down.\" Having reinvented herself as a winsome girl-next-door, she now commands $2.5m a movie following hits such as The Wedding Singer, Batman Forever and Scream. She also runs her own production company, Flower Films, and is filming the remake of Charlie's Angels with Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu. Mark Lester Now 41, the star of the film Oliver! won fame at the age of 10. By 14, was earning \u00a3100,000 a year as he starred in an average of two films a year. But, as puberty beckoned, the roles dried up. There seemed little to do but spend his newly released money: on his 18th birthday he was handed \u00a370,000 and went wild. \"I bought myself a Ferrari and it was party, party, party,\" he has said. \"It was terrific fun at first. I tried everything that was going, drink, dope, acid - whatever was on offer. For a teenage boy, it was like a dream come true.\" But it soon turned sour: the \u00a370,000 took just two years to get through, and his three-year relationship disintegrated when his girlfriend tired of his dissolute lifestyle. It was a wake-up call. He ended up in rehab, began to keep fit, and, at 28, went back to school to gain the A levels required to study osteopathy. Now married with young children, he runs a successful osteopathy and acupuncture clinic in Cheltenham. Macaulay Culkin At the age of nine, the star of Home Alone became the most successful child actor since Shirley Temple, garnering an estimated $40m (\u00a325m) fortune. But at 13, after a series of flops and his parents' custody battle, he refused to act again, instead dyeing his hair blue, spraying graffiti on his parents' apartment walls and playing truant. At 16, he took his parents - whom Hollywood insiders claim were living out their dreams through him - to court and wrested control of his fortune from them. At 17, he was married to fellow former child star Rachel Miner in what appeared to be a further fit of rebellion. It emerged last month that the couple have separated. He has hardly worked for the past six years. But he recently made a tentative move towards a badly needed comeback by auditioning to appear in a play in London's West End. Jodie Foster Foster appears to be the exception that proves the rule. From the age of three she was starring in commercials and soon became the family's breadwinner. She has appeared in 33 films. Yet she insists that regular work, her education and her mother's constant support, protected her. \"It's not as if I was a child star,\" she has said. \"I was a child actress, which is something completely different.\" Now 37, and a single mother with a baby son, she has become the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, earning a reputed \u00a310m per movie and winning Oscars for The Accused and Silence of the Lambs. She is also a director but suggests motherhood is her greatest achievement. Useful links: Harry Potter (Bloomsbury - UK) Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Warner Bros)",

Arguing that \"context is no defence\", the society declared: \"Anything which involves goading or cruelty to animals is unacceptable.\" </p> <p>That debate could now become more than academic. Following its British premiere at Edinburgh, Amores Perros (Love's a Bitch) is about to be picked up by a major UK distributor for release later this year. </p> <p>The film's director, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, insists he was scrupulous about not harming any animals during filming. Despite realistic-looking scenes in which dogs leap at each other, fangs apparently primed to bite, a lot was done in the shooting and editing - \"the same way I'd avoid hurting somebody in a car accident\". </p> <p>The dogs were wearing plastic muzzles - apparently clearly visible if you freeze-frame the film on video - while the ones that appear dead and bloodied were made up and drugged for 20 minutes at a time. The film's animal trainer is very respected in animal welfare circles, Gonzalez Inarritu says - \"and he used his own dogs, so he cared about them\". </p> <p>In Mexico, where the film has been a big hit, the press hardly commented on the animal cruelty question. There will certainly be more of a problem here. The British Board of Film Classification is rigorous about films that show or even suggest animal violence, saying: \"Baiting animals is a no-no as far as we are concerned, no matter how good the film is.\" </p> <p>While the subject matter could be a serious obstacle to British distribution, Gonzalez Inarritu is open to suggestions about cuts. \"If it was just frames, maybe. But if they wanted me to take out the dogfights, that would be impossible. They are part of the motion of the story and the characters.\" </p> <p>The movie is an intricately plotted portmanteau of three stories, linked by a car crash and told at car-crash speed. The first story has a group of poverty-level kids getting involved in the illicit and extremely violent dog-fighting scene; the second is a macabre Tale of the Unexpected about a supermodel, a luxury apartment and an ill-fated lapdog; and the third features an itinerant hitman who moves through different levels of city society, bringing all the strands together. </p> <p>Gonzalez Inarritu insists that context is very much a mitigating factor, and that the dogfighting theme is part of an overall panorama of life in his home town. \"I wanted to make a film about Mexico City, where there are millions of dogs. The dogfight is a cruel reality. But more than the fights, we were interested in the relations between dogs and people.\" </p> <p>He and his screenwriter, novelist Guillermo Arriaga Jordan, took on the city with Balzacian ambition, tackling it on various levels, from low-life to penthouse. \"Many Mexican directors,\" he says, \"are scared to shoot in Mexico City, which is why there are many stories in Mexican cinema about little rural towns, or set a hundred years ago. It's difficult to shoot there, not just technically but because it's such a complex mix. All the city's frontiers are falling - now you see rich districts where there are a lot of poor people.\" </p> <p>The three stories in Amores Perros are more or less true. The character El Chivo (The Goat) was based on a story that Arriaga had heard about a teacher who disappeared to join a guerrilla cell and was never seen again (in the film, he becomes a hitman). The story in which a model's lapdog is lost under her floorboards is also based on fact. \"But in real life it ended when they noticed a bad smell from under the floor.\" </p> <p>The film's intricately twisted structure has a ring of Pulp Fiction, but Gonzalez Inarritu isn't a big fan of Tarantino. \"I like the way he plays with structure - but I don't know why he gets the credit. It's really William Faulkner; it's a literary structure that has existed for a long time.\" And Gonzalez Inarritu insists he takes his violence very seriously. \"When you live in a city, as I do, where violence is really in the streets and people die every day, there's nothing funny about it. We try to show that violence has a consequence - when you create violence, it turns against you.\" </p> <p>Although Gonzalez Inarritu only attended two fights himself, he insists that his lurid vision of the dogfighting underworld is \"very, very accurate. Thirty per cent of the people in the movie are real people from the dogfighting world, and we used some real fighting dogs. It's shown the way they do it, in empty swimming pools and backlots. The people can be dangerous - there are drunk people, druggie people, violent people, and some of them take their children of four, five years old. But I don't judge them. For them it's like bullfighting or going fishing - for them it's natural, something you do on a Saturday.\" </p> <p>Gonzalez Inarritu admits he was afraid to handle the animals himself: \"These dogs are real motherfuckers.\" One animal used in the film was a security dog, trained to leap at a person's chest, and able to break ribs in the process. </p> <p>Gonzalez Inarritu came to film after a career as a radio DJ on Mexico's WFM rock station, where he had a daily show, \"telling stories to people, trying to keep them entertained for three hours. That was my training as a storyteller. You create stories with music, you create soundtracks for the lives of the people in the city - four million listeners every day.\" And four million stories in the naked city, no doubt. So far Gonzalez Inarritu has managed to tell three of them in one blast. Let's hope there are more to come. </p> <p>Amores Perros will be screened today at 8pm at Cameo 1, Edinburgh (0131-228 4141).</p>",

A bloated yellow snake slides across the screen as another cowboy in a black hat approaches. We've been here before. </p> <p>The stereotypes keep on coming: flouncing saloon girls and whisky-drunk hitchhikers; solitary gunplay in a motel room; the old Travis Bickle routine from Scorsese's Taxi Driver, itself a replay from all those gunslinger B-movies. \"You lookin' at me? Are you lookin' at me?\" The man with the gun knows the lines as well as we do. </p> <p>This is not a cowboy movie. This is not a road movie, despite the locale and the clothes and the soundtrack, with its cowpoke yodelling and Tex-Mex songs. \"We're not always undone by stereotypes - in some way they sustain us,\" Isaac Julien, director of The Long Road to Mazatlan, has remarked. This work, part of the exhibition Cinerama at Manchester's Cornerhouse Gallery, takes its title from a line in Tennessee Williams's Night of the Iguana, although Julien's film does no more than nod at Williams. </p> <p>It takes its cues more from Warhol's Lonesome Cowboys, ironic macho cowboy drag, and the male bodies swooning and plunging in David Hockney's painted pools. It is impossible to look at The Long Road to Mazatlan without recalling dozens of movies, dozens of novels. I think of the Border Trilogy of novels by Cormac McCarthy; Bob Hope and Bing Crosby on the road to nowhere; a whole jukebox full of familiar tunes. </p> <p>Julien is the writer and director of Young Soul Rebels (a tale of gay punks set in the Queen's jubilee year), Looking for Langston (about the 1920s Harlem Renaissance poet Langston Hughes) and Franz Fanon: Black Skin, White Mask (about the black psychiatrist and revolutionary). He has always been difficult to place. He is a film-maker, an artist, a theorist, a black Londoner who teaches at Harvard. His themes are black identity, history and culture, queer aesthetics and desire. His films and DVD installations are multi-layered, rich, poeticised, witty and sexy. He's an expert at the erotics of vision (in this case, the homoerotics). </p> <p>The Long Road to Mazatlan is a collaboration between 40-year-old Julien and Venezuelan-born choreographer and dancer Javier de Frutos. De Frutos also plays one of the work's two protagonists. The two men (for the first time in Julien's work, both the leading players are white) have an edgy attraction to one another, but the nearest we get to a coupling is a beautifully set mise-en-sc\u00e8ne in a garden swimming pool, and a moment or two in a motel room. The story, like their attraction, is never consummated. Which, it appears, is the whole point. The entire work is a kind of long deferral, a crossing and recrossing of roads and glances. </p> <p>This is clearly not a commercial movie or a straight story in any sense, much less a mere homage to Hollywood. Even so, it is haunted by the question of narrative and narrative conclusions, like many film and video works presented as art installations. Those artists who most successfully apply narrative structure - Iranian Shirin Neshat (currently at the Serpentine, and Fruitmarket, Edinburgh) and Finnish artist Eija-Liisa Ahtila - do so in the realisation that narrative thrust and drive are inevitably frustrated in the gallery, where the audience wanders in and out at will. We almost always enter at the wrong time, or feel that we do, and that the trajectory of whatever narrative there might be is always ahead of us, always somehow out of reach. Art film and video are almost inevitably forced to take a position close to the fractured approach of 20th-century avant- garde literature. They shuffle the pages, and present us with returns and reversals, repetitions, inversions, and breaks in the storyline. </p> <p>Julien has said of video art, disparagingly, that \"something had to replace painting\". And, like history and allegorical paintings, his films are reference-laden, spectacular presentations. They are screens on which things happen, places where the world is refracted and represented to us, foreshortened, condensed, cut down to size, yearned for and parodied. A place, then, where the fictional and the real meet. </p> <p>Vagabondia, Julien's second work here at the Cornerhouse (also made with De Frutos, who choreographed the dance sequences), turns film into a kind of place, and then invades it. A black female conservator, played by Cleo Sylvestre (who had a similar role in two previous Julien films, The Attendant and Three) wanders through London's Sir John Soane Museum, along with Soane himself, a second black woman in 18th-century garb, and a startling interloper, a lurching, dancing, crazed young man (the dancer Ben Ash), who might have stumbled in, gibbering and yelling, from William Beckford's gothic novel Vathek. </p> <p>Vagabondia seems to be all about the summoning of ghosts and the breaking of the obsessive, ultimately repressive order of Soane's maniacal collection. Julien uses a split screen, which doubles and reverses most of the action in a series of vertiginous reflections (an arresting technical effect, though sometimes a bit mechanical and wearisome). At some points we can no longer tell which is the true image, and what is apparition and reflection. </p> <p>Soane's house and the landscape of The Long Road to Mazatlan are both places of the imagination as much as they are exotic locations, caught in a kind of cinematic aspic. Julien is really good at pace, atmosphere, the conjunction of image and sound, the piquant shot. He knows how to grab us and keep us there, to keep us looking. His works have a kind of density and compaction and, in a sense, don't need storylines except as a way of keeping us looking. Almost every shot is entire, almost a novel in itself. </p> <p>Julien keeps us, as it were, suspended between beginnings and endings in a kind of perpetual present. Keeping us looking, and making us want to look again and again, concentrating and lapsing in and out of reverie as we do so, is a kind of erotic act, a seduction. But having seduced the viewer, he interrupts us, and turns the stereotypes on their head, swerves the story into a lesson about power and history and sex. That's why these are more than movies; that's where their art is. </p> <p>Isaac Julien and Javier de Frutos: Cinerama is at the Cornerhouse Gallery, Manchester (0161-200 1500), till September 17, and the South London Gallery (020-7703 6120) from September 22 to October 22.</p>",

That's why these are more than movies; that's where their art is. Isaac Julien and Javier de Frutos: Cinerama is at the Cornerhouse Gallery, Manchester (0161-200 1500), till September 17, and the South London Gallery (020-7703 6120) from September 22 to October 22.",

The Spanish driver of the 38-tonne articulated lorry involved in the crash has been arrested and is being questioned. Superintendent Alex Marshall, of Cambridgeshire Police's operational support services, visited the scene shortly after the crash and described what he saw as \"devastating\".

Police are appealing for witnesses and accident investigators were today seeking to piece together events in the run-up to the crash. Supt Marshall and Wing Commander David Ogg, from RAF Wittering, both expressed their \"deepest sympathies\" to the families of the victims.

      "body": "<p>It's eight o'clock on Friday evening in the village of Anston, a few miles east of Sheffield in South Yorkshire. Many of the locals are putting their feet up after a week's work, or preparing for a night out on the town. But for the players of Anston Women's Cricket Club it's the end of a tough two-hour training session. We caught up in the clubhouse for a group discussion on the pleasures and pitfalls of women's league cricket.</p> <p>The Anston women's team is 11 years old, and they play in division two of the ECB's northern league. Like many women's clubs, they're not exactly oversubscribed with players - Karen, the captain, says that even on a good day they have about 15. This means they only have one team - unlike the men's section of the club which has several senior and junior sides - so all age groups have to play together. The Anston players range from 13 to \"35-plus\", but the disparity doesn't stop them being a close-knit group who enjoy their cricket.</p> <p>Let's dispel a few myths. Firstly, they don't all play just because they have male relatives who are involved in the game. Secondly, they don't just fool around with a tennis ball pretending to play proper cricket - they get out there and get on with it. Oh, and thirdly, they're not just here to make the tea. The mere suggestion of this is enough to create a big reaction in the dressing-room: \"That kind of old-fashioned view still exists\", says Deb, the vice-captain, with some vigour, \"but you just have to try and stay out of it.\"</p> <p>So what do the players enjoy most about playing cricket? Some cite fitness and a long-standing interest in the game. But they all agree that one of the major selling-points is the social side of things: the opportunity to meet new people, the team spirit, plus the obligatory fun and banter. They're all more than useful players, but the general feeling seems to be that the standard of the cricket doesn't really matter as long as you're enjoying yourself.</p> <p>The women's game still has a few problems, though, and several ideas for improvement are suggested during the discussion. The first is better facilities for all, as explained by fast bowler Carla: \"We're quite lucky to be attached to this club\", she says, gesturing at the changing-room, showers and kit-store. \"There are plenty of places where you have to get changed in the car.\"</p> <p>Another bone of contention is money. The players have to pay all their own costs for getting to and from games: that's not so bad if you're in a men's team which might only have to travel a few miles to get a game, but as the Anston women's team plays as far afield as Manchester, Leicester and Newcastle, the costs soon mount up. ECB, please take note.</p> <p>It seems, though, that financial considerations apart, the travelling is all part of the fun - a chance to have a day out together and \"a bit of a laugh\". Some suggest that the men in the club may even be jealous that the women's team gets to travel to such exotic locations while they only play locally. But whatever the thoughts of the men, the women agree that it's nice to be different.</p> <p>The players at Anston all believe that women's cricket is on the way up.

      "bodyText": "It's eight o'clock on Friday evening in the village of Anston, a few miles east of Sheffield in South Yorkshire. Many of the locals are putting their feet up after a week's work, or preparing for a night out on the town. But for the players of Anston Women's Cricket Club it's the end of a tough two-hour training session. We caught up in the clubhouse for a group discussion on the pleasures and pitfalls of women's league cricket. The Anston women's team is 11 years old, and they play in division two of the ECB's northern league. Like many women's clubs, they're not exactly oversubscribed with players - Karen, the captain, says that even on a good day they have about 15. This means they only have one team - unlike the men's section of the club which has several senior and junior sides - so all age groups have to play together. The Anston players range from 13 to \"35-plus\", but the disparity doesn't stop them being a close-knit group who enjoy their cricket. Let's dispel a few myths. Firstly, they don't all play just because they have male relatives who are involved in the game. Secondly, they don't just fool around with a tennis ball pretending to play proper cricket - they get out there and get on with it. Oh, and thirdly, they're not just here to make the tea. The mere suggestion of this is enough to create a big reaction in the dressing-room: \"That kind of old-fashioned view still exists\", says Deb, the vice-captain, with some vigour, \"but you just have to try and stay out of it.\" So what do the players enjoy most about playing cricket? Some cite fitness and a long-standing interest in the game. But they all agree that one of the major selling-points is the social side of things: the opportunity to meet new people, the team spirit, plus the obligatory fun and banter. They're all more than useful players, but the general feeling seems to be that the standard of the cricket doesn't really matter as long as you're enjoying yourself. The women's game still has a few problems, though, and several ideas for improvement are suggested during the discussion. The first is better facilities for all, as explained by fast bowler Carla: \"We're quite lucky to be attached to this club\", she says, gesturing at the changing-room, showers and kit-store. \"There are plenty of places where you have to get changed in the car.\" Another bone of contention is money. The players have to pay all their own costs for getting to and from games: that's not so bad if you're in a men's team which might only have to travel a few miles to get a game, but as the Anston women's team plays as far afield as Manchester, Leicester and Newcastle, the costs soon mount up. ECB, please take note. It seems, though, that financial considerations apart, the travelling is all part of the fun - a chance to have a day out together and \"a bit of a laugh\". Some suggest that the men in the club may even be jealous that the women's team gets to travel to such exotic locations while they only play locally. But whatever the thoughts of the men, the women agree that it's nice to be different. The players at Anston all believe that women's cricket is on the way up. More teams are becoming established, and more people involved. Sure, there might be a few difficulties, but there's nothing that can't be fixed with the right commitment. I ask everyone in the dressing-room whether they would recommend playing cricket to anyone who might be reading this and considering it. The answer is a unanimous \"Yes\". I'm trying to think of a way to finish off and summarize everyone's feelings, when Deb does it for me. \"Look\", she says, \"the more people we get involved, the more promotion we're going to get, and the better it's going to be.\" Catherine Hanley is an Australian who supports Somerset and lives and works in Sheffield.

Last week the university had yet another high-profile clobbering in the press, this time over a report examining why women get fewer first-class degrees than men. The reason for the imbalance, the study suggested, was a structural bias in the way exams are marked that favours male candidates. </p> <p>Particularly unfortunate for the university is the timing of the report, which was published in the same week as girls achieved sparkling results at A-level. Girls now outperform boys at every stage from reception to year 13, but for some reason this trend suddenly reverses if they go to Oxford. While 22% of male candidates at the university got first-class degrees last year, only 17% of women achieved the same result. </p> <p>It's hardly a new story - the university's failure to achieve gender parity at finals level is reported almost annually. What remains unclear is exactly why the gender gap is still, depressingly, in place. The tentative conclusion of the new study, published in the British Journal of Psychology, is that the way exams are marked at Oxford may favour men since they are perceived to be better at \"flair\" arguments, which the marking system often explicitly rewards. According to Dr Jane Mellanby, a psychology don at the university and co-author of the report, everything may come down to a man's highly-developed facility for writing \"elegant bullshit\". </p> <p>As a woman who left Oxford in the mid-90s with a first in English, I don't feel I experienced prejudice or barriers to academic success at any stage in my university career - or perhaps I, too, am just an elegant bullshitter. The thing that most surprised me about Oxford, in fact, was that, once inside, it was one of the most meritocratic societies I had ever encountered.

If you could succeed within those terms of reference it didn't matter if you were male, female, a rugby lad or a complete misfit. </p> <p>The colleges are also competing with each other, and I found tutors prepared to offer extraordinary amounts of support to candidates they believed to be borderline firsts. One might choose to see this as cynical self-interest, but it undoubtedly helped me to do well. </p> <p>It should be manifestly obvious, however, that distilling everything to the point where intelligence - or rather, academic facility - is the only currency of importance creates a pretty brutal environment. If it is true that women are, in general, less well suited to an environment explicitly geared around competition, they may be justified in feeling discriminated against, on this level at least. </p> <p>Jane Blumer, the sabbatical women's officer at the university's student union, believes women may feel that the collegiate environment, refined over centuries to suit the way male students have worked, is less nurturing to women. \"Possibly women feel that they don't belong here, that their place is less assured,\" she says. \"In some colleges, women have only been admitted for 25 years, so you have a lot of catching up to do on the 500 years that the men have been there. If you start off feeling like the new girl it's difficult to adjust the balance over three years.\" </p> <p>This impression is backed up by Mellanby's research, which found similar levels of \"intelligence\" (based on IQ tests) in male and female candidates, but vastly differing levels of confidence. Men expected to do better in their finals, and were prepared to take more risks in the way they revised and responded to exam questions. Women worked harder, but experienced considerably more depression and anxiety. </p> <p>\"Some women feel very at home here,\" says Blumer, \"but others don't. They wonder if their tutor got their name wrong in the admissions procedure, and they haven't got over that by the time finals come along.\" </p> <p>In October the university will launch a four-year study into the impact of gender and social factors on admissions and results, which should provide further concrete information and dispense with the need to rely on persuasive, but still often quite anecdotal, impressions as to where Oxford may need to improve its performance. </p> <p>In the meantime, last week's A-level results may provide a significant clue. The gradual improvement in young women's exam performances at 16 and 18 appears to be loosely tied to the changes to exams over the past 15 years - it is widely accepted that the introduction of GCSEs, which rely more heavily on coursework, has favoured the way girls work - or perhaps disadvantaged boys.</p> <p>The development of A-levels along similar lines has arguably helped girls at 18 as well. If it is true that women do better when continually assessed, this may explain why the gender gap is particularly pronounced at Oxford, where students are judged almost entirely on their performance in an intensive week of highly pressurised exams. </p> <p>There is no doubt that Oxford takes the problem seriously - Birmingham University announced last week that it planned to introduce a system where candidates sit their finals anonymously, something that has been standard practice at Oxford for some time. </p> <p>But the university may be forced to take uncomfortable decisions if the gradual improvement of women's performances up the age-scale does not extend to its own final exams. While the distinction between getting a first and a 2:1 may seem unimportant for most jobs a few years after graduating, the fact that research funding is almost exclusively given to candidates with firsts makes Oxford's gender gap particularly dangerous.

Hard physical labour at the beginning of the summer, he says, helps him to work off aggression. He then spent a week in Hong Kong (university business) and went to see friends at Princeton. Summer reading The Way of Death, by Paul Johnson. A crime thriller set in Edinburgh, 2025. Also in his suitcase are volume 2 of Richard Holmes' biography of Coleridge. He is also re-reading Dependent Rational Animals, the philosopher, Alaistair MacIntyre's study of morality and virtue. Professor Drummond Bone, University of London, principal The second half of July was spent at his manse in Fife (he's got a walled garden, too) with his wife Vivian and their airedale, Clarissa. Summer reading Includes a Royal Society study of sustainable development in Europe, and The Man without Qualities, vol 4, by Robert Musil. Professor Sir John Daniels, Open University, vice chancellor Spent two weeks cruising the Kennet and Avon Canal. \"It is very relaxing and active,\" he said. \"I spend so much time travelling for my job that heading off in a plane doesn't appeal.\" Afterwards, he took a \"semi-holiday\" visiting the Open University's first residential school in Spain at Santiago de Compostela. Summer reading The Social Life of Information by John Seely Brown and Paul Duguid, \"partly to review it and partly because it's a very good book\". Also, Giles Milton's Nathaniel's Nutmeg, \"because all his family are nuts about it\". Professor Phillip Love, Liverpool University, vice chancellor Currently soaking up the sun in Singapore with his wife, Isobel, then to Bali. Summer reading A selection of medical and legal novels by authors such as David Baldacci, Patricia Cornwell and John Grisham. Professor Adrian Smith, Queen Mary and Westfield College, principal He's off to Cephalonia, the Ionian island made famous by Captain Corelli's Mandolin. Summer reading Michael Ignatieff's biography of Isaiah Berlin, David Cannadine's Class in Britain, and Gillian Shephard's political memoirs, Shephard's Watch: Illusions of power in British Politics. \"It's catch-up time,\" he explains. Anthony Giddens, London School of Economics, director The most hardworking of our sample, Giddens doesn't intend to take a holiday this summer: \"I will take some time off to do some reading if I can, but you know what these jobs are like, a bit enveloping,\" he explains. \"I might try to write a book instead - I'd like to write one about Britain, the position of the country at the moment and its likely prospects.\" Summer reading It Didn't Happen Here by Seymour Martin Lipset and Gary Marks, about the non-development of socialism in the US. Professor Rick Trainor, Glasgow University, vice principal (becomes vice chancellor of Greenwich University this autumn) Three weeks on Squirrel Island with his family. This car-less island off the Maine coast can only be reached by ferry. So Professor Trainor reckons he should have decompressed by the time he gets there. Summer reading John Campbell's biography of Margaret Thatcher, which he hopes will be \"useful for decoding the past and musing about the future\".",

      "bodyText": "Chronic lung disease among women nearly doubled between 1990 and 1997, according to a survey of 500 GPs' surgeries in England and Wales published today. The information, based on analysis of the General Practice Research Database, found there had been a \"substantial increase\" in the incurable disease in women aged more than 65, with rates in women aged 45 to 65 becoming equivalent to those in older men by 1996. Alarmingly for the medical profession, rates in women under 45 exceeded those for men under 45 by the mid-1990s - when male rates peaked. Joan Soriano and Will Maieer, of Glaxo Wellcome Research whose research is published in the journal Thorax, found almost half of 50,000 new cases diagnosed over the seven years were in women. Although men had the highest prevalence and mortality rates for the disease, overall women experienced the greatest increase in cases. The researchers said the full effects for women had yet to be seen, as shown by the steady rise in lung cancer. Lung disease is believed to be the fifth most common cause of death worldwide. Dr Soriano said: \"Because of the ageing of the population and the cumulative effect of smoking by women, the already evident burden of chronic lung disease in public health is likely to increase in the future. \"Physicians and health care providers need to prepare for this growing burden by ensuring that adequate resources are available to care for these patients. \"Additional education about the effects of tobacco smoking also appears to be needed to promote smoking cessation, especially in younger women.\" The anti-smoking campaign group ASH warned that the findings highlighted a dangerous trend: \"While smoking among men has fortunately been reduced, it has risen in women and this is borne out by these figures. \"Some studies can be just statistical blips, but this seems to be over a long period of time and obviously shows a worrying trend.\" Coinciding with publication of this research was a separate survey highlighting the health risks of passive smoking. A study of 10,000 police officers in Hong Kong found passive smoking greatly increased the amount of time that non-smokers took off work. Victims of secondhand smoke were also more likely to take medicines and make more visits to the doctor. Non-smoking men exposed to passive smoking at work for more than a year were twice as likely to take time off, and 30% more likely to have treatment for respiratory symptoms than colleagues in a smoke-free environment. The results held true even after accounting for levels of passive smoking at home, said researchers writing in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. Sarah McGhee, of the University of Hong Kong, called for a ban on workplace smoking. \"We must take steps to protect not only children but also adults from passive smoking, by ensuring effective bans on smoking in all workplaces and other sites where involuntary exposure occurs.\" ASH said: \"This study reaffirms the dangers of passive smoking - the only people who doubt it are the tobacco industry. \"With the TUC last year we worked out there are 3m non-smokers in the UK who are subjected to other workers' cigarette smoke.\"",

The bond lead-managed by Dresdner was called Synthetic Ecuador Bond, while Credit Suisse managed the Ecuador Synthetic Sovereign Investments Bond. They were issued in 1996 and 1997 by investment vehicles in Jersey and went into default in autumn 1999, the firm said. The investors want the DM272,000 (\u00a384,375) they invested plus annual interest of 8.25%; their lawyers said the total issue volume of the bonds was DM375m (\u00a3117m). Funds on the rebound Gross sales of British investment funds rose in July to their highest level since April and were well ahead of levels a year earlier, according to data from Autif, the Association of Unit Trusts and Investment Funds, which showed investment funds under management edging up to a record \u00a3265.3bn in July. Gross sales of funds rose to \u00a34.48bn in July from \u00a34.27bn in June - well below March's \u00a37.57bn in March, the best month for sales in the past year, but ahead of the \u00a33.71bn achieved in July 1999. Swissair denies plans for BA Swissair's parent, SAirGroup, yesterday denied it had done a study on the benefits of a tie-up with British Airways, itself now in talks with KLM, and said it had no plans for partnerships with either airline. SAirGroup spokesman Hans Klaus said a report in the Mail on Sunday suggesting a study had been done was wrong. He said SAirGroup's main priority for its airlines business was to build up the Qualiflyer group of airlines. Ebner dumps Roche stake Pharma Vision, the pharmaceutical investment company owned by Swiss banker Martin Ebner, said it sold its entire stake in Roche Holding, or 21.6% of its portfolio. In May Roche's board rejected a request by Mr Ebner to become a board member.",

      "bodyText": "Ten days of drama in the Arctic reached a grim climax last night when all 118 Russian crew who went down with the Kursk nuclear submarine in the Barents Sea on August 12 were declared dead in the country's worst naval disaster. Norwegian rescue divers who opened two escape hatches on the stern of the 500ft vessel found the rear section of the submarine flooded and the first of the dozens of dead sailors. In a terse statement last night, Russia's northern fleet offered condolences to the families of the 118 men as the defence minister, Igor Sergeyev, went on national television to declare that the crew was lost and to defend the top brass against public charges of incompetence and callousness. All national television programmes broadcast sombre obituaries for the crewmen, screening a roll call of the names and ranks of the dead mariners against a backdrop of stormy sea. Scores of grieving relatives continued to arrive in Murmansk. \"There's no doubt the crew has perished,\" the chief of staff of the northern fleet, vice-admiral Mikhail Motsak, pronounced on television. Last night the rescue attempt gave way to recovery and recrimination - the attempt to recover the corpses, grief at a tragedy that has struck a chord throughout Russia and anger at the authorities who displayed contempt in crisis, misinforming the public, delaying and bungling the rescue effort and agreeing to accept foreign help only when it was too late. For days, the Russians tried and failed to open the escape hatch at the rear of the vessel, reporting that it was severely damaged by the unexplained explosion that caused the sinking. On Sunday, the Russians said the Norwegian divers would also be unable to open the hatch.

The British LR5 mini-submarine, taken by plane and boat from Glasgow to the Barents Sea to attempt its first deep-sea crew rescue set off for Norway last night without ever taking to the water. Moscow asked the Norwegian experts to continue helping in the hazardous operation to bring out the dead. Vice-admiral Motsak said the two governments had reached agreement on the participation of the Norwegian divers in the corpse recovery effort. But the divers have not yet entered what is now a huge steel tomb on the seabed and are believed to be against the idea. Last night remote video equipment was being lowered into the submarine to survey the interior of section nine and remote control manipulators were to be used to try to retrieve the sole unidentified corpse discovered. Given the perils for divers trying to enter the stricken submarine, the recovery effort is expected to focus on raising the vessel, a daunting challenge since the flooded weight of the Kursk is estimated at 25,000 tonnes. Despite government claims last week that only the Russians and the Americans have the technical wherewithal to mount such an undertaking, the Russians do not have the money, the expertise, or the equipment to raise the Kursk and any such attempt will take months. \"There isn't a single country that can handle such an operation on its own,\" said Ilya Klebanov, the deputy prime minister who heads the government inquiry into the disaster. He said Moscow was launching an international appeal to raise funds for the effort. The cause of the explosions which wrecked the bow of the submarine, precipitating the sinking and the total flooding, remain unclear.

In a move which appears to strike a blow to the heart of the Official Secrets Act, the charges are limited to the allegations he made to a Sunday newspaper three years ago before he fled to the continent. These include MI5's practice of holding files on prominent Labour politicians, radical pop stars such as John Lennon, and what he called the \"incompetence and bureaucracy\" of MI5 - notably over its surveillance of suspected Libyan intelligence officers in London. The charges laid against him at a London police station yesterday also include documents he allegedly took from MI5's headquarters at Millbank, Westminster. However, they do not cover a spate of allegations he subsequently made in exile. Mr Shayler has alleged that the 1994 bombing of the Israeli embassy in London could have been avoided as could the IRA bombing of Bishopsgate in the City in 1993 - the subject of a recent article he wrote for Punch for which the magazine's editor faces contempt of court charges. The most glaring omission from the charge sheet is the plot to kill Col Gadafy. It is possible the police have insufficient direct evidence against Mr Shayler - their attempt to seize any notes the Guardian and Observer newspapers may have relating to the alleged 1996 plot was dismissed by the appeal court last month. Mr Shayler yesterday said he had no doubt why the Gadafy plot was not included in the charges. \"The government has backed off, they don't want to fight,\" he said. \"I wonder whether this is an attempt to prevent the jury from hearing the whole story\", he added.

John Wadham, Mr Shayler's lawyer and director of Liberty, the civil rights group, said his client had not been interviewed by the police and the police were not investigating any other offences. He also said that the Human Rights Act, which comes into force on October 2, will mean that the Official Secrets Act will have to comply with article 10 of the European convention on human rights which guarantees the right to freedom of expression. Many government lawyers believe that the secrets act is incompatible with the European human rights convention by making it an absolute offence for any member or former member of the security and intelligence services to say anything about their work without authority. Mr Wadham said that Mr Shayler will argue in court that he made his disclosures in the public interest. They caused no damage, he will argue in a case which will almost certainly involve MI5 officers having to take the stand. The Official Secrets Act's compatibility with the Human Rights Act could be tested before Mr Shayler puts his case. In November Nigel Wylde a former senior Army officer, is due to appear on secrets charges relating to information about computer surveillance systems he is alleged to have given to the journalist, Tony Geraghty. Mr Shayler, who will appear at Bow Street magistrates court on Thursday where he will enter a not guilty plea, came out fighting yesterday. saying he could make further allegations about MI5. Meanwhile, he said, \"I am going to get pissed\".",

Only one woman, Marjorie Scardino, the chief executive of Pearson, appears in the league table.</p> <p>Three top executives achieved millionaire status on basic salary alone. The remaining members of the \"millionaire's club\", the full list of which will be published tomorrow, were able to boost their compensation through gains on share options and other long-term incentive plans, intended to link pay with performance.</p> <p>The survey highlights the changing nature of Britain's boardrooms - with executives from the United States dominating the top rungs of this year's league. Two Americans of Asian descent, little known in the UK and both employed by Vodafone during the 1999 financial year, top the table. Arun Sarin cashed in options and other share-based awards to take home \u00a321m, while Mohan Gyani, who as a result of \u00a314m on gains over options, achieved \u00a316m.</p> <p>The options over shares awarded to executives which are yet to be cashed in are not included in the survey, a factor which would propel another American, Paul Chisholm, the outgoing chief executive of Colt Telecom, higher up the table. He is sitting on options worth \u00a3113m, in addition to the gains of \u00a314.7m he made on his options this year.</p> <p>Nine senior executives received payoffs of more than \u00a31m last year, the survey found, including Bob Ayling, the ousted chief executive of British Airways, who ranks among the top earners because of the \u00a31.9m retirement package he was awarded on his departure this year. The largest \"golden goodbye\" - worth nearly \u00a35m - went to Steven Kotler, an investment banker who ran the US operations of Schroders.</p> <p>The 16.5% year-on-year rise in directors' pay is based on their total base salaries during the last financial year and takes no account of gains made on options or other performance-related pay deals. While directors' enjoyed large rises, the average wage in the country rose, according to government figures, by 4.1%.</p> <p>The survey is published as big investor groups step up pressure on boardrooms to curb excesses, following the decision by National Association of Pensions Funds, whose members control a quarter of the stock market, to issue recommendations on how to vote at crucial annual meetings.</p> <p>In an early example of its new activism, the association expressed dismay at this year's annual general meeting of Vodafone, after the company awarded a \u00a310m bonus to Chris Gent, the chief executive. The payment falls outside of the scope of this year's survey.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The pay of Britain's top bosses rose by 16.5% last year, four times the average wage increase, according to a survey by pay consultants Inbucon for the Guardian. More than 110 senior executives received \u00a31m or more last year, the survey found, highlighting the wealth being created for directors in the boardrooms of the country's 100 largest companies. Only one woman, Marjorie Scardino, the chief executive of Pearson, appears in the league table. Three top executives achieved millionaire status on basic salary alone. The remaining members of the \"millionaire's club\", the full list of which will be published tomorrow, were able to boost their compensation through gains on share options and other long-term incentive plans, intended to link pay with performance. The survey highlights the changing nature of Britain's boardrooms - with executives from the United States dominating the top rungs of this year's league. Two Americans of Asian descent, little known in the UK and both employed by Vodafone during the 1999 financial year, top the table. Arun Sarin cashed in options and other share-based awards to take home \u00a321m, while Mohan Gyani, who as a result of \u00a314m on gains over options, achieved \u00a316m. The options over shares awarded to executives which are yet to be cashed in are not included in the survey, a factor which would propel another American, Paul Chisholm, the outgoing chief executive of Colt Telecom, higher up the table. He is sitting on options worth \u00a3113m, in addition to the gains of \u00a314.7m he made on his options this year. Nine senior executives received payoffs of more than \u00a31m last year, the survey found, including Bob Ayling, the ousted chief executive of British Airways, who ranks among the top earners because of the \u00a31.9m retirement package he was awarded on his departure this year. The largest \"golden goodbye\" - worth nearly \u00a35m - went to Steven Kotler, an investment banker who ran the US operations of Schroders. The 16.5% year-on-year rise in directors' pay is based on their total base salaries during the last financial year and takes no account of gains made on options or other performance-related pay deals. While directors' enjoyed large rises, the average wage in the country rose, according to government figures, by 4.1%. The survey is published as big investor groups step up pressure on boardrooms to curb excesses, following the decision by National Association of Pensions Funds, whose members control a quarter of the stock market, to issue recommendations on how to vote at crucial annual meetings. In an early example of its new activism, the association expressed dismay at this year's annual general meeting of Vodafone, after the company awarded a \u00a310m bonus to Chris Gent, the chief executive. The payment falls outside of the scope of this year's survey.",

      "body": "<p>Having escaped from a submarine 300ft down during an exercise in a Scottish loch, I can perhaps imagine the situation that was faced by the Norwegian divers working on the Kursk. The water would have been bitterly cold at around 3C to 4C and even if the sun is shining on the surface it is completely dark at 400ft. This is compounded by the knowledge that even a minor accident could be fatal at that depth.</p> <p>The divers would not, however, have been concerned about the depth, the cold or the darkness. They spend most of their working lives in such inhospitable places. They will have spent time in a cramped saturation diving chamber on board their ship for up to 17 days. Their mother ship will keep itself positioned over the Kursk while they are diving. Even the diving bell that will lower the men to the bottom is kept at a constant height above the submarine.</p> <p>To combat the cold the divers wear suits that keep them dry while hot water is pumped around pipes in the suit, from the surface, to maintain their body temperature. This enables them to spend up to six hours at a time working on the submarine. They wear hard diving helmets with powerful lights and remain attached to their diving bell by an umbilical that delivers a constant supply of breathing gas.</p> <p>At 400ft down they will be breathing about 5% oxygen and 95% helium. If they were to breathe 20% oxygen, as on the surface, they would soon become unconscious as even oxygen is toxic at these depths. The nitrogen in the air would cause delirium and unconsciousness quickly and hence this is replaced by the inert gas helium. Usually the divers would work as a team of three with one remaining in the bell in case of emergency. All of this technology and expertise has resulted from the needs of the oil industry and thankfully enables these underwater capabilities to be available at times of need.</p> <p>The real fear faced by these men was what they would find in the submarine. They are used to working on oil rigs and pipelines, not salvage operations and recovering bodies. Indeed these divers share many things with the submariners lying dead inside the Kursk. Both groups of men spend their working lives under the sea facing the ever-present hazards that this environment brings. They both live in confined spaces with their colleagues for many weeks at a time - one group protecting our security, the other helping to provide the oil that powers our western lifestyle. The camaraderie and mutual respect that comes from facing adversity as a team is similar among divers and submariners.</p> <p>I escaped from a Royal Navy submarine in 1993 and recall the moments before my turn came to climb up into the escape tower. I was waiting with my colleagues in the escape compartment watching intently as each man was sent on his way to the surface. Despite it being an exercise I was still very anxious and sat in silence.</p> <p>I climbed the steel ladder that leads up into the one-man escape tower. Despite only being 5ft 7in tall I could not fit my shoulders straight through the lower hatch and had to raise my left arm to squeeze into the tower. Once in the tower the lower hatch is shut and you are on your own. Then the water thundered in and soon went over the top of my head as I struggled to clear my ears and keep my lungs full of the hot compressed air, as the pressure rose. Eventually the lid opened and I was off to the surface.</p> <p>The Norwegian divers would have had to squeeze themselves back down this narrow 6ft-high tower and through the tiny lower hatch with all of their bulky equipment - I was only wearing an immersion suit with a pair of overalls underneath and found it a tight squeeze.</p> <p>After a six-hour dive they would return to the diving bell and return to the mother ship. The diving bell would be locked onto the accommodation chamber so they could remain at the same pressure, while other divers went down. Once the diving operations are over they will spend three to four days more in the chamber, to be decompressed back to the surface pressure and will have time to reflect on what they witnessed.</p> <p>There may be one comforting thought to emerge from the news that the submarine rapidly flooded - any survivors caught in air pockets or breathing compressed air from the submarine's air supply would have been breathing air at the same pressure as the surrounding sea. They would have been oblivious to what was going on within a few minutes due to the effects of nitrogen narcosis that comes from breathing air (containing 80% nitrogen) at such great depths, so their suffering would have been shortlived.</p> <p>Dr Mark Turner is a former diving medical officer and submarine escape instructor in the Royal Navy.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Memories of a near 30-year-old mystery resurfaced yesterday after workmen uncovered human remains in the outbuildings of a South Wales pub. The Aubrey Arms inYstradgynlais, near Swansea, was closed while detectives carried out a search of the property where the discovery was made. Locals believe the skeleton, found yesterday morning by builders converting a store room, could be that of the former landlady, Barbara Maddocks, who disappeared in October 1973. Dyfed Powys police confirmed last night that they had launched an inquiry following the discovery but refused to comment on the find. They said forensic tests were still being carried out. When police investigated Mrs Maddocks's disappearance 27 years ago, they dug up a roundabout opposite the pub and part of a road below a nearby bridge. Mrs Maddocks's husband, Bill, who died of natural causes 10 years ago, insisted he knew nothing about his wife's disappearance. Howard Evans, 75, said he remembered the landlady's disappearance well because of the commotion it caused at the time. He said that Mrs Maddocks, whom he described as a popular, good-looking woman, had come to Wales from Australia. \"Some people thought that she might have just packed her bags and gone home. But certainly there were a lot of people who thought differently. The police were very active but didn't find anything.\"",

      "body": "<p>As mourning shrouds Russia, the candles lit in hundreds of churches for the 118 submariners of the Kursk can only flicker in honour of their souls. For not only has all hope for the sailors' lives gone, some of the faith in a New Russia has died too.</p> <p>A political inquest has begun and it was two of the youngest MPs, Boris Nemtsov, a leader of the Union of the Rightwing Forces, and Sergei Ivanenko of the centrist Yabloko party, who demanded that the Duma - Russia's lower house - holds hearings as soon as it reconvenes early next month.</p> <p>As the questions pile up, the timing of when President Vladimir Putin first learned of the gravity of the accident will become more important than his inappropriate reactions.</p> <p>Even yesterday, as television showed him chairing a meeting in the Kremlin, he was not in a black tie. The inquest will reveal whether the navy authorities told him the truth, and whether he can escape some blame for his insensitive behaviour by saying he was kept in the dark.</p> <p>The incident which sent the Kursk to the bottom of the Barents Sea occurred at 10.31am on Saturday August 11 according to a distant boom which foreign seismic listening-devices picked up. A second loud boom followed two and a quarter minutes later. The Russian Navy says the first time it became aware of a problem was 13 hours afterwards when the Kursk failed to give a pre-arranged signal.</p> <p>If this was true, it would be easy to understand how Mr Putin seemed so relaxed during a meeting with Gennady Seleznev, the Duma Speaker, at 1pm that Saturday, shortly before he set off on holiday. No one knew then that disaster had struck the pride of the navy's Northern fleet. But Mr Seleznev suggested that the navy might have known but did not see fit to tell the president. The Speaker said he too favoured a parliamentary inquiry.</p> <p>The postmortem inquiry is bound to ask why it took so long for Mr Putin to accept foreign offers of help, particularly since it emerged that the navy had no deep-sea diving team and that its rescue efforts were doomed. The government failed to approach private oil companies such as Lukoil which operate drilling rigs, but in a sign that the new Russian oligarchs are still partly stuck in the past none of them offered professional help. Only a few individual divers came forward.</p> <p>The lies, secrecy, and appalling insensitivity of the authorities will also merit scrutiny. It was only when the newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda, paid an officer under the counter to obtain the crew list that the families knew whether their loved ones were trapped in the sunken vessel. The navy itself did not tell them. Mr Putin and the government failed to come up with any offer of free transport for the relatives, let alone of organising special flights to Murmansk, until two days ago.</p> <p>The navy bosses trotted out the usual Soviet-style excuse that bad weather was the reason why rescue efforts were failing. Pulling out the phoney rule \"Always keep morale high\", they peddled false optimism, pretending there was hope long after it was realistic.</p> <p>It was only when Oleg Dobrodeyev, the chief editor of the state owned RTR television station, had the courage to insist on getting his cameramen on to the battle-cruiser leading the rescue operation that Russians began to see a little of what was going on.</p> <p><b> Heroes</b><br></p> <p>The only heroes in this sad affair have been the press. Led by the independent TV channel, NTV, and its radio stable-mate, Moscow Echo, as well as the newspapers Komsomolskaya Pravda and Novaya Gazeta they have been pointing out the contradictions in official statements, asking the searching questions, and running the blistering headlines.</p> <p>For the young generation, brought up in the wild post-communism of the 1990s, the events of the past 10 days have struck an especially sharp blow. Not only were there some two dozen 19- and 20-year-old conscripts among the dead, but it is the young who most wanted to see a different, cleaner, and more accountable Russia grow out of the Yeltsin era.</p> <p>\"Everything I see on TV leads me to think that nothing serious is being done to save the sailors,\" Alexander Mramornov, a 16-year-old wrote to one Moscow paper. \"In countries where the bureaucracy is not all-powerful like ours, the president takes charge.\"</p> <p>Yesterday Mr Putin still did not seem to have embraced the country's changed mood. He allowed the cameras briefly into the cabinet room in the morning but made no formal declaration. Before being ushered out, reporters heard him say that the agenda included the tragedy in the Barents Sea as well as a report on security problems in central Asia.</p> <p>\"The defence minister has delivered an account of various military-technical aspects of the operations in the Barents Sea. Now we are going to talk about humanitarian aspects,\" the president told reporters. \"The families of the sailors will get special help.\"</p> <p>It sounded like the secretary of a provincial branch of the Communist party grudgingly running through the agenda for the benefit of a cowed and loyal press.</p> <p>Shortly after he spoke, it was left - again - to the media to fill the sensitivity gap and lead the national mourning. The two main television channels, one private, the other state owned, began their evening news broadcasts with solemn music and a slow roll call of the names of every lost crew member. There was no address by the president, and no declaration of a day of mourning. Not for the first time, Russia waits for change.</p> <p><b>Truth was the first casualty</b><br></p> <p><b> How the navy hid the truth about the submarine's fate. </b><br></p> <p><b> \u0095 Saturday August 12</b></p> <p><b> 10.31am</b> Two explosions in forward torpedo compartment of the Kursk.</p> <p><b> 11.20pm</b> Kursk fails to make radio contact with command.

Sonar sweeps of area report sounds, interpreted as survivors tapping hull with metal objects.</p> <p>It is claimed that the crew made a controlled descent, that \"liaison with the submarine is established\", and the crew had time to shut down the twin reactors.</p> <p>The Kursk flooded and sank like a stone after two explosions in the forward torpedo compartment. No communication was ever established with the crew.</p> <p>Officials say they are lowering a diving bell to supply Kursk with electric power and oxygen. Russia rejects offers of help from Britain, Norway and the US.</p> <p>The Russian navy had neither diving bell, nor the deep-sea divers. Rescuers did nothing except film the site.</p> <p><b> \u0095 Tuesday August 15</b></p> <p>Storm begins. A spokesman for the Russian navy again claims oxygen is being supplied to the Kursk.</p> <p>A hotline is established for relatives, but the navy refuses to name the crew.</p> <p>The Russian mini-submarine is not as advanced as those offered by the US and Britain. The only divers Russia sent down were equipped with light diving gear, and went down at grave risk to themselves.

      "bodyText": "As mourning shrouds Russia, the candles lit in hundreds of churches for the 118 submariners of the Kursk can only flicker in honour of their souls. For not only has all hope for the sailors' lives gone, some of the faith in a New Russia has died too. A political inquest has begun and it was two of the youngest MPs, Boris Nemtsov, a leader of the Union of the Rightwing Forces, and Sergei Ivanenko of the centrist Yabloko party, who demanded that the Duma - Russia's lower house - holds hearings as soon as it reconvenes early next month. As the questions pile up, the timing of when President Vladimir Putin first learned of the gravity of the accident will become more important than his inappropriate reactions. Even yesterday, as television showed him chairing a meeting in the Kremlin, he was not in a black tie. The inquest will reveal whether the navy authorities told him the truth, and whether he can escape some blame for his insensitive behaviour by saying he was kept in the dark. The incident which sent the Kursk to the bottom of the Barents Sea occurred at 10.31am on Saturday August 11 according to a distant boom which foreign seismic listening-devices picked up. A second loud boom followed two and a quarter minutes later. The Russian Navy says the first time it became aware of a problem was 13 hours afterwards when the Kursk failed to give a pre-arranged signal. If this was true, it would be easy to understand how Mr Putin seemed so relaxed during a meeting with Gennady Seleznev, the Duma Speaker, at 1pm that Saturday, shortly before he set off on holiday. No one knew then that disaster had struck the pride of the navy's Northern fleet. But Mr Seleznev suggested that the navy might have known but did not see fit to tell the president. The Speaker said he too favoured a parliamentary inquiry. The postmortem inquiry is bound to ask why it took so long for Mr Putin to accept foreign offers of help, particularly since it emerged that the navy had no deep-sea diving team and that its rescue efforts were doomed. The government failed to approach private oil companies such as Lukoil which operate drilling rigs, but in a sign that the new Russian oligarchs are still partly stuck in the past none of them offered professional help. Only a few individual divers came forward. The lies, secrecy, and appalling insensitivity of the authorities will also merit scrutiny. It was only when the newspaper, Komsomolskaya Pravda, paid an officer under the counter to obtain the crew list that the families knew whether their loved ones were trapped in the sunken vessel. The navy itself did not tell them. Mr Putin and the government failed to come up with any offer of free transport for the relatives, let alone of organising special flights to Murmansk, until two days ago. The navy bosses trotted out the usual Soviet-style excuse that bad weather was the reason why rescue efforts were failing. Pulling out the phoney rule \"Always keep morale high\", they peddled false optimism, pretending there was hope long after it was realistic. It was only when Oleg Dobrodeyev, the chief editor of the state owned RTR television station, had the courage to insist on getting his cameramen on to the battle-cruiser leading the rescue operation that Russians began to see a little of what was going on. Heroes The only heroes in this sad affair have been the press. Led by the independent TV channel, NTV, and its radio stable-mate, Moscow Echo, as well as the newspapers Komsomolskaya Pravda and Novaya Gazeta they have been pointing out the contradictions in official statements, asking the searching questions, and running the blistering headlines. For the young generation, brought up in the wild post-communism of the 1990s, the events of the past 10 days have struck an especially sharp blow. Not only were there some two dozen 19- and 20-year-old conscripts among the dead, but it is the young who most wanted to see a different, cleaner, and more accountable Russia grow out of the Yeltsin era. \"Everything I see on TV leads me to think that nothing serious is being done to save the sailors,\" Alexander Mramornov, a 16-year-old wrote to one Moscow paper. \"In countries where the bureaucracy is not all-powerful like ours, the president takes charge.\" Yesterday Mr Putin still did not seem to have embraced the country's changed mood. He allowed the cameras briefly into the cabinet room in the morning but made no formal declaration. Before being ushered out, reporters heard him say that the agenda included the tragedy in the Barents Sea as well as a report on security problems in central Asia. \"The defence minister has delivered an account of various military-technical aspects of the operations in the Barents Sea. Now we are going to talk about humanitarian aspects,\" the president told reporters. \"The families of the sailors will get special help.\" It sounded like the secretary of a provincial branch of the Communist party grudgingly running through the agenda for the benefit of a cowed and loyal press. Shortly after he spoke, it was left - again - to the media to fill the sensitivity gap and lead the national mourning. The two main television channels, one private, the other state owned, began their evening news broadcasts with solemn music and a slow roll call of the names of every lost crew member. There was no address by the president, and no declaration of a day of mourning. Not for the first time, Russia waits for change. Truth was the first casualty How the navy hid the truth about the submarine's fate. \u0095 Saturday August 12 10.31am Two explosions in forward torpedo compartment of the Kursk. 11.20pm Kursk fails to make radio contact with command. Search starts. \u0095 Sunday August 13 3am Kursk found on seabed. Navy receives pictures showing scale of damage. The commander of the northern fleet, Admiral Vyacheslav Popov, declares to the Russian media that the exercises were a perfect success. \u0095 Monday August 14 10.30am Interfax and RIA Novosti, quoting sources at navy HQ in Moscow, report that a submarine is on the seabed due to \"technical problems\". The navy denies that the Kursk is flooded and says there is no damage to the hull. Sonar sweeps of area report sounds, interpreted as survivors tapping hull with metal objects. It is claimed that the crew made a controlled descent, that \"liaison with the submarine is established\", and the crew had time to shut down the twin reactors. The Kursk flooded and sank like a stone after two explosions in the forward torpedo compartment. No communication was ever established with the crew. Officials say they are lowering a diving bell to supply Kursk with electric power and oxygen. Russia rejects offers of help from Britain, Norway and the US. The Russian navy had neither diving bell, nor the deep-sea divers. Rescuers did nothing except film the site. \u0095 Tuesday August 15 Storm begins. A spokesman for the Russian navy again claims oxygen is being supplied to the Kursk. A hotline is established for relatives, but the navy refuses to name the crew. The Russian mini-submarine is not as advanced as those offered by the US and Britain. The only divers Russia sent down were equipped with light diving gear, and went down at grave risk to themselves. Six almost perished in a collision with surface ship. \u0095 Wednesday August 16 Storm in Barents sea abates. After a conversation with Bill Clinton, Vladimir Putin orders naval chiefs to accept foreign aid, but only offers from Norway and Britain are accepted. A navy deputy chief of staff says the crew is still signalling by tapping on the hull. Officials later say that the last sound from the vessel came on Monday . \u0095 Friday August 18 Russian newspaper publishes complete list of those on board, but only after paying a \u00a3440 bribe. Mr Putin says accepting foreign aid earlier would have made no difference because foul weather would have interfered with the rescue. Western diving experts said strong underwater currents would have made little difference to their operation. \u0095 Saturday August 19 Hours before the arrival of a British submersible and its Norwegian mothership, officials say damage to the vessel is massive, and that most of the crew died within minutes of the explosions. \u0095 Sunday August 20 The deputy prime minister, Ilya Klebanov, says Norwegian divers have discovered the hatch will have to be torn off with a hauser. He also claims a man may be trapped in the escape hatch. Norway denies the existence of the trapped man, and says its divers reached no such conclusion about opening the outer hatch. They eventually open both the outer and inner hatches relatively easily.

      "body": "<p>Discussions of top pay invariably produce a split, some would say a chasm, between those who reckon the market must decide the appropriate level of remuneration and those who believe companies must be free to offer incentives, which will allow them to recruit and retain the best people, and those for whom it is simply a question of fat cats and gravy trains. </p> <p>But whichever side of the debate you stand on, three issues emerge with particular clarity from today's Guardian-Inbucon survey. </p> <p>The first is what in the jargon is often referred to as \"golden goodbyes\" - payments to directors leaving the company. </p> <p>Two points here. First, directors who choose to leave for other jobs should not be paid a golden goodbye. It may be that early leavers have accrued benefits over a period of service which have not yet fallen due and feel they need to be compensated. Forgoing such benefits, however, must be a factor for executives to take into account in deciding whether or not to move. The issue should not be settled at shareholders' expense. </p> <p>Directors who are forced out are another matter. There is a powerful argument for saying there should not be rewards for failure. But life is seldom that easy. Departures can be sparked, for example, by a genuine division over the best direction for the company to take rather than any perceived incompetence or failure. It is clearly in the best interests of shareholders if such de partures are achieved with the minimum of disruption. The question is the price. Companies might consider the idea of Hollywood-style prenuptual agreements: shareholders would at least know where they stood. </p> <p>Second, remuneration packages are increasingly complex. Pay, pensions, bonuses, share options can all be important parts of an overall deal. It would surely be a good idea if companies were to adopt identical methods of reporting the various ingredients - ideally with sufficient information to allow shareholders to assess easily the overall value. </p> <p>Finally, the morality of the size of the rewards on offer. Among the ranks of men in suits listed in our tables this morning is just one woman. At a time when the educational establishment has gone into a worried huddle about laddish culture and underachievement the composition of Britain's boards is surely a matter which demands equal concern. Perhaps the City could start with a \"gender and achievement\" website of the kind being launched by the Department of Education and Employment in order to promote best practice. </p> <p><strong> EasyJet snub </strong><br> </p> <p> EasyJet's decision not to extend its initial public offering to retail investors sits uncomfortably with its no-frills image. </p> <p>Its argument that, if it opened up the offer, the subsequent scramble for shares could leave many with disappointingly small stakes might appear rather arrogant but does have some merit. EasyJet's flair for publicity means it has a high profile which could attract widespread interest in the stock. </p> <p>It could try to satisfy the potential retail demand by reserving all the shares being offered for small investors, but ruling out institutional support is hardly a sensible course. That said, even if EasyJet is not overstating its attractions, it may be underestimating the sophistication of retail investors. </p> <p>Many would probably be happy with a modest stake in a firm whose services they probably use and whose \"small guy takes on big guy\" approach they may well admire. Whatever the likelihood of disappointment to some investors if they were to receive only small allotments in an offer open to retail investors, EasyJet will disappoint more fans by restricting it to business class. </p> <p><strong> Marriage lines </strong><br> </p> <p> Yesterday's document from the UK and German supervisory authorities on the iX merger was understandably long on principle and rather shorter on detail. It is for the exchanges to propose the arrangements they want to set in place before the authorities can decide the extent such proposals meet its criteria for properly run markets. </p> <p>For the supervisors as much as the exchanges, the devil will be in the detail. Some degree of harmonisation already exists or is looming into view on a European Union-wide basis, but that will hardly suffice for an undertaking of this nature which seeks to marry two cultures as well as two sets of rules. The problems will arise when it comes, for example, to defining what constitutes on and off exchange trading, or tricky issues such as determining what constitutes normal market size - baffling to outsiders, perhaps, but vitally important to market participants. </p> <p>The supervisors, just as much as the exchanges, will have to come up with solutions which not only work but which do not appear to lean more towards one of the existing regimes in London and Frankfurt than to the other.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Discussions of top pay invariably produce a split, some would say a chasm, between those who reckon the market must decide the appropriate level of remuneration and those who believe companies must be free to offer incentives, which will allow them to recruit and retain the best people, and those for whom it is simply a question of fat cats and gravy trains. But whichever side of the debate you stand on, three issues emerge with particular clarity from today's Guardian-Inbucon survey. The first is what in the jargon is often referred to as \"golden goodbyes\" - payments to directors leaving the company. Two points here. First, directors who choose to leave for other jobs should not be paid a golden goodbye. It may be that early leavers have accrued benefits over a period of service which have not yet fallen due and feel they need to be compensated. Forgoing such benefits, however, must be a factor for executives to take into account in deciding whether or not to move. The issue should not be settled at shareholders' expense. Directors who are forced out are another matter. There is a powerful argument for saying there should not be rewards for failure. But life is seldom that easy. Departures can be sparked, for example, by a genuine division over the best direction for the company to take rather than any perceived incompetence or failure. It is clearly in the best interests of shareholders if such de partures are achieved with the minimum of disruption. The question is the price. Companies might consider the idea of Hollywood-style prenuptual agreements: shareholders would at least know where they stood. Second, remuneration packages are increasingly complex. Pay, pensions, bonuses, share options can all be important parts of an overall deal. It would surely be a good idea if companies were to adopt identical methods of reporting the various ingredients - ideally with sufficient information to allow shareholders to assess easily the overall value. Finally, the morality of the size of the rewards on offer. Among the ranks of men in suits listed in our tables this morning is just one woman. At a time when the educational establishment has gone into a worried huddle about laddish culture and underachievement the composition of Britain's boards is surely a matter which demands equal concern. Perhaps the City could start with a \"gender and achievement\" website of the kind being launched by the Department of Education and Employment in order to promote best practice. EasyJet snub EasyJet's decision not to extend its initial public offering to retail investors sits uncomfortably with its no-frills image. Its argument that, if it opened up the offer, the subsequent scramble for shares could leave many with disappointingly small stakes might appear rather arrogant but does have some merit. EasyJet's flair for publicity means it has a high profile which could attract widespread interest in the stock. It could try to satisfy the potential retail demand by reserving all the shares being offered for small investors, but ruling out institutional support is hardly a sensible course. That said, even if EasyJet is not overstating its attractions, it may be underestimating the sophistication of retail investors. Many would probably be happy with a modest stake in a firm whose services they probably use and whose \"small guy takes on big guy\" approach they may well admire. Whatever the likelihood of disappointment to some investors if they were to receive only small allotments in an offer open to retail investors, EasyJet will disappoint more fans by restricting it to business class. Marriage lines Yesterday's document from the UK and German supervisory authorities on the iX merger was understandably long on principle and rather shorter on detail. It is for the exchanges to propose the arrangements they want to set in place before the authorities can decide the extent such proposals meet its criteria for properly run markets. For the supervisors as much as the exchanges, the devil will be in the detail. Some degree of harmonisation already exists or is looming into view on a European Union-wide basis, but that will hardly suffice for an undertaking of this nature which seeks to marry two cultures as well as two sets of rules. The problems will arise when it comes, for example, to defining what constitutes on and off exchange trading, or tricky issues such as determining what constitutes normal market size - baffling to outsiders, perhaps, but vitally important to market participants. The supervisors, just as much as the exchanges, will have to come up with solutions which not only work but which do not appear to lean more towards one of the existing regimes in London and Frankfurt than to the other.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair was yesterday told by backbench MPs to \"get his head out of the sand\" and come to the aid of Labour's manufacturing heartlands after a new report showed that the north-south divide is widening. Ronnie Campbell, who chairs the northern group of Labour MPs, urged the prime minister to stop ignoring the plight of the north-east and to do more to help England's most deprived regions. The Blyth Valley MP's comments followed the release of a report on relative economic growth rates in the English regions, which forecast that the south-east would easily outpace other parts of the country, increasing the gap in living standards between north and south. The figures from Oxford Economic Forecasting reignited the debate within the government over whether enough has been done to help regions hit by the slump in manufacturing. While ministers have seized on encouraging economic figures to suggest the north-south divide is no longer an issue, backbench Labour MPs from manufacturing regions fear that voters have not seen the benefits of the good performance of the UK economy since the election. Yesterday's report, commissioned by the Financial Times, revealed that that growth rates will be more evenly matched between regions than they were last year. The worst performing region last year, the north-east, only just escaped recession while the east, which includes Silicon Fen, the booming hi-tech region around Cambridge, grew by nearly 4%. This year the top performing region, the south-east, excluding London, will grow by 3.7%, while the slowest growing region, again the north-east, will expand by 2.7%. Scotland and Wales were set to do better than the north, with Scotland to enjoy 2.9% growth, Wales 3.2%, the report said. Although growth in the north-east is expected to improve, yesterday's figures show that the prosperity gap will once again widen this year, undermining the claim made by Mr Blair last December that the north-south divide was \"over-simplistic\". The prime minster insisted that the \"real divide\" was \"between the haves and the have nots\", regardless of where people lived. Responding to the report, Mr Campbell called for a regional assembly to represent the interests of the poorer English regions. \"There are regions of this country that are just being ignored,\" he said. He added that Tony Blair and other senior ministers \"don't seem to listen\" to calls for help from the heartlands. While acknowledging that the government had attempted to address the north-south divide, Mr Campbell said he feared that regions such as his native north-east and Cornwall were being left behind while Scotland and Wales were \"marching ahead\" and reaping the financial benefits of devolution. \"Those from the northern group of MPs are just whistling in the wind,\" he told Radio 4's Today programme. \"I want a regional assembly because I think we are only going to be left behind further.\" Richard Caborn, the trade minister, acknowledged that there were regional disparities and \"problems inside the English regions\" but he insisted that the gap was narrowing. \"There is economic under-performance, we all accept that,\" he told the Today programme, adding that \"unemployment is falling faster in the north-east, the north-west and the west Midlands than it is in the south-east\". But John Redwood, head of the Conservative parliamentary campaigns unit, described Labour policy as a \"huge betrayal\" of British manufacturing, while the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, accused the government of exacerbating the north-south divide through taxes which were \"felt most heavily in the least prosperous parts of the country\".

Mr Putin's powerlessness in the face of the trapped submariners is a symptom of a much more widespread weakness. Russia's crumbling state could do nothing to save the Kursk, and not much to prevent still worse catastrophes from happening in the future.</p> <p>It is not only the country's nuclear facilities that are rusting away - at fearful risk to Russia and the world, as Gwyn Prins wrote last week. An enfeebled state cannot stop the plundering of Russia's natural resources. Illegal logging is destroying its forests. Deeply scarred by 70 years of Soviet central planning, Russia's environment is now at grave risk from the decay of the Russian state.</p> <p>Mr Putin's efforts to strengthen the authority of government have been lauded in the west. Yet his policies do not bode well for the protection of nature in Russia. He is credited with seeking to rein in the mafias that are thriving in the wake of the country's failed transition to a western-style market economy.

Mr Putin's powerlessness in the face of the trapped submariners is a symptom of a much more widespread weakness. Russia's crumbling state could do nothing to save the Kursk, and not much to prevent still worse catastrophes from happening in the future. It is not only the country's nuclear facilities that are rusting away - at fearful risk to Russia and the world, as Gwyn Prins wrote last week. An enfeebled state cannot stop the plundering of Russia's natural resources. Illegal logging is destroying its forests. Deeply scarred by 70 years of Soviet central planning, Russia's environment is now at grave risk from the decay of the Russian state. Mr Putin's efforts to strengthen the authority of government have been lauded in the west. Yet his policies do not bode well for the protection of nature in Russia. He is credited with seeking to rein in the mafias that are thriving in the wake of the country's failed transition to a western-style market economy. But he has chosen to abolish two of its principal environmental agencies - the State Committee for Environmental Protection and the Federal Forestry Service - that have curbed poaching in the past. As a result, the wild Siberian tiger - already reduced to a few hundred in numbers - faces extinction in the near future. At the same time, Russia's human population has gone into free fall.

Sources close to ING and Williams de Broe confirmed the sale yesterday. Williams de Broe management members are unlikely to exercise their right of first option to buy ING's 77.46% shareholding. The firm has been owned by ING since 1986. In July, however, ING paid \u00a3127m for Charterhouse Securities, which immediately put a for-sale sign on Williams de Broe, according to insiders. \"They couldn't find what they were looking for with Williams De Broe, otherwise they wouldn't have made another acquisition,\" one said. ING is said to be keen to develop Charterhouse Securities, a rapidly growing medium-sized broker. A likely buyer of Williams de Broe, which has operations in Britain, Switzerland and France, is Belgium's KBC Banking and Insurance Holding Company. \"If this should come on to the market we will look into it in the same way that we would look into any other opportunity that comes on to the market,\" a KBC spokesman said. KBC bid against ING for Charterhouse. Other potential buyers of Williams de Broe include France's Paribas, Banco Santanda Central Hispano of Spain and Bank of America. ING owns its stake in Williams de Broke through its subsidiary, Banque Bruxelles de Lambert. Both BBL and John Millar, chairman of Williams de Broke, declined to comment. Williams de Broe has 300 staff, and in 1999 reported net profit up 50% to \u00a36m. Its turnover increased from \u00a334.1m to \u00a347.1m, while shareholder equity rose from \u00a34.5m to \u00a38.8m.

The plan was clearly intended to help Ehud Barak through his domestic political difficulties and it is easy to see how he might have sold the package to the Israeli public: Israeli sovereignty would keep the city undivided; the boundary changes would tilt the demographic balance heavily in Israel's favour by introducing more Jews and excluding many Palestinians; religious Jews would get the right to pray on the site of the Temple. On the other hand, it is difficult to see how Mr Arafat could have persuaded the Palestinians, or the Arab-Islamic world in general, that it was anything less than capitulation. Describing the plan as \"virtual sovereignty\" and allowing Palestinian flags to fly in symbolic places could not disguise the fact that Israel would have ultimate authority. In relation to East Jerusalem, the Old City (where less than 10% of the inhabitants are Jewish) and particularly the Haram (the third holiest site in Islam), the vast majority of Arabs regard Israeli sovereignty as unjustified.

In recent weeks, thousands of members have defected to opposition parties.</p> <p>Prominent among the causes of discontent are corruption and a belief that too many of the new black elite - inside and outside the ANC - are primarily motivated by personal gain at the expense of poor black people.</p> <p>The ANC's immediate concern is the fear of a backlash in November's local government elections for the administration of sprawling new \"megacities\", which will draw municipalities such as Johannesburg into single councils with Soweto and surrounding black townships.</p> <p>In an attempt to maintain the party's fortunes in its core constituency without giving ground on key policies, Mr Mbeki has turned on those he believes bring the ANC into disrepute; a primary target is graft and \"careerism\" in the government and his party's ranks, from the top to its 5,000 councillors.</p> <p>\"Our experience in the last six years tells us that there is absolutely no reason why we should assume that we ourselves stand no danger of becoming victim to the widespread corruption we have seen in other countries, in Africa and elsewhere in the world,\" he warned at a key party conference last month. \"It is the masses of the people who get robbed and condemned to perpetual poverty, while a small elite flourishes on ill-gotten gains.\"</p> <p>Mr Mbeki has also warned against allowing the ANC leadership to become a \"self-centred ruling elite\" which, in other African countries, has triggered military coups or permitted \"reactionary forces\" to seize power.</p> <p>He poured scorn on \"a value system based on the pursuit of personal wealth at all costs\" and those newly enriched black citizens whose idea of equality is to emulate the lifestyle of the white elite, or those who have become the public face of white-owned companies in order to win government contracts.</p> <p>The top 20% of black wage-earners take home nearly two-thirds of all the income brought in by black workers. Where once there was a struggle for rights, now there is as often the pursuit of luxury cars and ever-bigger houses.</p> <p>The sceptics argue that the government's economic policies, with their emphasis on business and the free market, encourage precisely the behaviour the president criticises.</p> <p>It has added to the growing strains in the traditional ANC alliance with the party's union and Communist party allies. The Communists need the ANC for their survival as a party. The unions do not. Most recently, that relationship has been shaken by government plans to amend labour laws to ease restrictions on overtime and weekend work, and to make it easier to dismiss workers.</p> <p>The government argues that existing labour laws are too restrictive and deter foreign investment. The unions say the government is putting business interests before poorly paid workers and is facing a showdown \"on a scale never seen before\".</p> <p>Zwelinzima Vavi, the secretary general of the union federation Cosatu, said the new labour laws will result in \"the mass destruction of jobs\".</p> <p>\"These proposals ... threaten to plunge the country into a major political crisis,\" he said. \"If these amendments are pushed down our throats, blood will be on the floor. This represents a major crisis ... it's a crisis of integrity.\"</p> <p>The crisis of integrity is the unions' belief that the ANC wants their support at the ballot box but otherwise ignores them in favour of keeping the business sector happy.</p> <p>\"We must avoid a chicken and pig partnership. The chicken makes a partial contribution while the pig sacrifices its life in order to make bacon and eggs,\" said Mr Vavi.</p> <p>The ANC's secretary general, Kgalema Motlanthe, conceded that the alliance is \"failing\" to improve the lives of ordinary people when he admitted that its principal effectiveness lies in fighting elections.</p> <p><b>Useful links: </b><br></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.anc.org.za/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.anc.org.za/</a> African National Congress homepage<br> <a href=\"http://www.cosatu.org.za/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.cosatu.org.za/</a> Congress of South African Trade Unions</p>",

Prominent among the causes of discontent are corruption and a belief that too many of the new black elite - inside and outside the ANC - are primarily motivated by personal gain at the expense of poor black people. The ANC's immediate concern is the fear of a backlash in November's local government elections for the administration of sprawling new \"megacities\", which will draw municipalities such as Johannesburg into single councils with Soweto and surrounding black townships. In an attempt to maintain the party's fortunes in its core constituency without giving ground on key policies, Mr Mbeki has turned on those he believes bring the ANC into disrepute; a primary target is graft and \"careerism\" in the government and his party's ranks, from the top to its 5,000 councillors. \"Our experience in the last six years tells us that there is absolutely no reason why we should assume that we ourselves stand no danger of becoming victim to the widespread corruption we have seen in other countries, in Africa and elsewhere in the world,\" he warned at a key party conference last month. \"It is the masses of the people who get robbed and condemned to perpetual poverty, while a small elite flourishes on ill-gotten gains.\" Mr Mbeki has also warned against allowing the ANC leadership to become a \"self-centred ruling elite\" which, in other African countries, has triggered military coups or permitted \"reactionary forces\" to seize power. He poured scorn on \"a value system based on the pursuit of personal wealth at all costs\" and those newly enriched black citizens whose idea of equality is to emulate the lifestyle of the white elite, or those who have become the public face of white-owned companies in order to win government contracts. The top 20% of black wage-earners take home nearly two-thirds of all the income brought in by black workers. Where once there was a struggle for rights, now there is as often the pursuit of luxury cars and ever-bigger houses. The sceptics argue that the government's economic policies, with their emphasis on business and the free market, encourage precisely the behaviour the president criticises. It has added to the growing strains in the traditional ANC alliance with the party's union and Communist party allies. The Communists need the ANC for their survival as a party. The unions do not. Most recently, that relationship has been shaken by government plans to amend labour laws to ease restrictions on overtime and weekend work, and to make it easier to dismiss workers. The government argues that existing labour laws are too restrictive and deter foreign investment. The unions say the government is putting business interests before poorly paid workers and is facing a showdown \"on a scale never seen before\". Zwelinzima Vavi, the secretary general of the union federation Cosatu, said the new labour laws will result in \"the mass destruction of jobs\". \"These proposals ... threaten to plunge the country into a major political crisis,\" he said. \"If these amendments are pushed down our throats, blood will be on the floor. This represents a major crisis ... it's a crisis of integrity.\" The crisis of integrity is the unions' belief that the ANC wants their support at the ballot box but otherwise ignores them in favour of keeping the business sector happy. \"We must avoid a chicken and pig partnership. The chicken makes a partial contribution while the pig sacrifices its life in order to make bacon and eggs,\" said Mr Vavi. The ANC's secretary general, Kgalema Motlanthe, conceded that the alliance is \"failing\" to improve the lives of ordinary people when he admitted that its principal effectiveness lies in fighting elections.

It is not so long ago that the British army shot its own traumatised men for \"cowardice\", and there is still a battle for survivors of the Gulf war to be taken seriously. Mike Spring Edinburgh",

      "body": "<p>Britain's top boardrooms are beginning to look like the Premiership in English football: escalating salaries irrespective of performance, a disregard for public opinion, an increasing number of foreign players and no women.</p> <p>Our latest survey shows that basic boardroom salaries - excluding stock options - rose by 16% last year, or three and a half times the rate of growth of average earnings. This is not a one-off correction of an anomaly. It has been going on for years. Nor is it a reward for exceptional individual performance, since the vast majority of board members share in the annual harvest. There are no women in the top 20 (though Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of Pearson, has this year managed to creep into the top 30 at 26th). Four of the top six highest earning directors are from overseas.</p> <p>It is right and proper that managers with outstanding talent should be properly rewarded. What is unacceptable is the way that top executive remuneration has become a self-perpetuating gravy train. Committees of non-executive directors (themselves the future beneficiaries of the climate they help to nourish) recommend increases linked to a going rate in the outside world. It is a recipe for a rising spiral of inflation that would never be tolerated by the same directors when they fix their employees' pay.</p> <p>Directors are supposed to lead from the front. It is time they took the lead on pay - or else the divide between the highest and the lowest paid in the country will widen to socially unacceptable proportions. If they don't do it, then shareholders, who are starting to understand the untapped power they possess as owners of companies, must take the lead instead. And what about the government? Last year ministers promised to change legislation to make it easier for shareholders to act on unacceptable increases. We are still waiting for a statement. Meanwhile, the gravy train is one of the few that doesn't run late.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's top boardrooms are beginning to look like the Premiership in English football: escalating salaries irrespective of performance, a disregard for public opinion, an increasing number of foreign players and no women. Our latest survey shows that basic boardroom salaries - excluding stock options - rose by 16% last year, or three and a half times the rate of growth of average earnings. This is not a one-off correction of an anomaly. It has been going on for years. Nor is it a reward for exceptional individual performance, since the vast majority of board members share in the annual harvest. There are no women in the top 20 (though Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of Pearson, has this year managed to creep into the top 30 at 26th). Four of the top six highest earning directors are from overseas. It is right and proper that managers with outstanding talent should be properly rewarded. What is unacceptable is the way that top executive remuneration has become a self-perpetuating gravy train. Committees of non-executive directors (themselves the future beneficiaries of the climate they help to nourish) recommend increases linked to a going rate in the outside world. It is a recipe for a rising spiral of inflation that would never be tolerated by the same directors when they fix their employees' pay. Directors are supposed to lead from the front. It is time they took the lead on pay - or else the divide between the highest and the lowest paid in the country will widen to socially unacceptable proportions. If they don't do it, then shareholders, who are starting to understand the untapped power they possess as owners of companies, must take the lead instead. And what about the government? Last year ministers promised to change legislation to make it easier for shareholders to act on unacceptable increases. We are still waiting for a statement. Meanwhile, the gravy train is one of the few that doesn't run late.",

      "body": "<p>Mexico's beleaguered Institutional Revolutionary party has lost the election for governor in the southern state of Chiapas, six weeks after defeat in the presidential election signalled the end of its seven-decade monopoly of national government.</p> <p>The defeat in Sunday's election came at the hands of Pablo Salazar, a charismatic maverick who trounced the PRI candidate, Sami David, to romp to victory at the head of the eight-party Alliance for Chiapas. With 71% of the votes counted yesterday, Mr Salazar had 54% and Mr David 45%.</p> <p>\"This day will be inscribed in our memory as the day the people of Chiapas decided to change our personal and collective destiny,\" Mr Salazar said in a victory speech that underlined his commitment to find a peaceful solution to the six-year Zapatista conflict over indigenous rights.</p> <p>\"Go on and cry, go on and cry,\" his supporters chanted as they flooded into the streets of the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez, to revel in the failure of the PRI's legendary party machine to deliver in its first major test since Vicente Fox of the National Action party (PAN) won the presidency on July 2.</p> <p>Chiapas was one of the minority of states where the PRI came out on top in the presidential poll, and the party was desperate to hold onto the governorship to show it could keep total collapse at bay.</p> <p>As a result, there had been fears of violence from PRI-linked paramilitary groups which emerged after the Zapatista uprising in 1994.</p> <p>There were also predictions of widespread dirty tricks. A 4,000-strong army of observers spread out across the mainly rural state on polling day, but there were few major incidents. A low turnout was blamed on intimidation.</p> <p>Acknowledging defeat, the incumbent PRI governor, Roberto Albores, said: \"I plead with all the Chiapanecos who did not vote for the winner to accept the decision of the majority. It is an order that we must follow for the good and the calm of Chiapas and Mexico,\" he said.</p> <p>Chiapas was always considered a PRI stronghold, largely because of local strongmen who kept the rank and file in line. The opposition was divided, and Zapatista communities have tended to view electoral politics as a waste of time.</p> <p>But Mr Salazar's campaign gathered steam in the wake of Mr Fox's victory, and he managed to bring together the right of centre PAN and its long-running leftwing rival, the Democratic Revolution party ( PRD) within his alliance.</p> <p>A political analyst, Alfonso Zarate, said the Chiapas poll was \"the dispute between the new democratic political order that has been strengthened by July 2 elections and the vestiges of the ancien regime seeking to resist the changes\".</p> <p>The poll has been seen as a possible turning point in the Zapatista conflict. Mr Fox has expressed his wish to push for a negotiated solution. \"As president-elect my commitment and my obligation is to work together with Pablo Salazar with the aim of achieving peace,\" he said in a statement in which he promised to dust off a 1996 peace agreement on indigenous rights, known as the San Andres Accords.</p> <p>The accords were shelved by the outgoing administration of President Ernesto Zedillo, prompting the rebels led by the masked sub-comandante Marcos to break off all dialogue and withdraw to jungle hide-outs.</p> <p>Marcos himself has been notably silent about the country's new political situation. But most analysts believe the rebels, whose support has been waned over the years, could not afford to remain aloof from a Fox peace offensive supported by Governor Salazar.</p> <p>But in the highland Zapatista community of Polho, the election was viewed with ambiguity. Sitting in front of a large handpainted sign adorned with pictures of masked fighters and indigenous peasants and announcing \"Welcome to the autonomous municipality of Polho in rebellion,\" Filomeno Hernandez said the new president and governor would have to prove their openness to Zapatista demands before the negotiations could restart.</p> <p>\"We will wait to see what happens. If the army was withdrawn then sure, we would think about negotiating.\"</p>",

The defeat in Sunday's election came at the hands of Pablo Salazar, a charismatic maverick who trounced the PRI candidate, Sami David, to romp to victory at the head of the eight-party Alliance for Chiapas. With 71% of the votes counted yesterday, Mr Salazar had 54% and Mr David 45%. \"This day will be inscribed in our memory as the day the people of Chiapas decided to change our personal and collective destiny,\" Mr Salazar said in a victory speech that underlined his commitment to find a peaceful solution to the six-year Zapatista conflict over indigenous rights. \"Go on and cry, go on and cry,\" his supporters chanted as they flooded into the streets of the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez, to revel in the failure of the PRI's legendary party machine to deliver in its first major test since Vicente Fox of the National Action party (PAN) won the presidency on July 2. Chiapas was one of the minority of states where the PRI came out on top in the presidential poll, and the party was desperate to hold onto the governorship to show it could keep total collapse at bay. As a result, there had been fears of violence from PRI-linked paramilitary groups which emerged after the Zapatista uprising in 1994. There were also predictions of widespread dirty tricks. A 4,000-strong army of observers spread out across the mainly rural state on polling day, but there were few major incidents. A low turnout was blamed on intimidation. Acknowledging defeat, the incumbent PRI governor, Roberto Albores, said: \"I plead with all the Chiapanecos who did not vote for the winner to accept the decision of the majority. It is an order that we must follow for the good and the calm of Chiapas and Mexico,\" he said. Chiapas was always considered a PRI stronghold, largely because of local strongmen who kept the rank and file in line. The opposition was divided, and Zapatista communities have tended to view electoral politics as a waste of time. But Mr Salazar's campaign gathered steam in the wake of Mr Fox's victory, and he managed to bring together the right of centre PAN and its long-running leftwing rival, the Democratic Revolution party ( PRD) within his alliance. A political analyst, Alfonso Zarate, said the Chiapas poll was \"the dispute between the new democratic political order that has been strengthened by July 2 elections and the vestiges of the ancien regime seeking to resist the changes\". The poll has been seen as a possible turning point in the Zapatista conflict. Mr Fox has expressed his wish to push for a negotiated solution. \"As president-elect my commitment and my obligation is to work together with Pablo Salazar with the aim of achieving peace,\" he said in a statement in which he promised to dust off a 1996 peace agreement on indigenous rights, known as the San Andres Accords. The accords were shelved by the outgoing administration of President Ernesto Zedillo, prompting the rebels led by the masked sub-comandante Marcos to break off all dialogue and withdraw to jungle hide-outs. Marcos himself has been notably silent about the country's new political situation. But most analysts believe the rebels, whose support has been waned over the years, could not afford to remain aloof from a Fox peace offensive supported by Governor Salazar. But in the highland Zapatista community of Polho, the election was viewed with ambiguity. Sitting in front of a large handpainted sign adorned with pictures of masked fighters and indigenous peasants and announcing \"Welcome to the autonomous municipality of Polho in rebellion,\" Filomeno Hernandez said the new president and governor would have to prove their openness to Zapatista demands before the negotiations could restart. \"We will wait to see what happens. If the army was withdrawn then sure, we would think about negotiating.\"",

I'm much more frightened of the process I've seen happen to so many women after the birth: the exhaustion and anaemia that overtake women who are not given a chance to recuperate; the illness and depression suffered by women still breastfeeding a five-month-old baby every hour because that is what they think \"demand-feeding\" means; the sense of failure experienced by women who give up breastfeeding (a staggering 33% do so in the first six weeks) because the once-an-hour business defeated them; the wan, depleted faces of parents whose five, or six, or 15-month-old won't sleep through the night; the ugly hatred and rage that can flare up in a mother tyrannised by her child's cries.

      "body": "<p>Marion Jones wants to be the Mark Spitz of the 21st century. The 24-year-old track and field star plans to win five gold medals at the Olympics next month, setting a new record in athletics the way Spitz, with seven in 1972, set it in swimming. It may well happen, for Jones, currently the fastest female in the world, clearly has the talent. But she also has a confidence, many say arrogance, that is pushing people's buttons in a way unseen before. </p> <p>From the beginning, Jones did not dare to suggest, wish, or hope she might win five medals. She declared it a certainty. Even to a public shed of many sexist attitudes about women being non-starters in sports - witness the hysteria following the US women's football team winning the World Cup, the Spice Girls-like adulation for the Williams sisters at Wimbledon - Jones is too much. She is too boastful, too assertive, too cocksure she will bring home the gold. In short, she is displaying character traits Americans ascribe to male athletes. But in men the chest-thumping is admired. In women, it is shocking, and has led to Jones being called arrogant, pretentious, and a certain word that rhymes with rich. </p> <p>But Jones won't apologise for her bravado, and nor should she, suggests Colette Dowling, author of an audacious new book about women and sports, The Frailty Myth. Though not published until September, it has already sparked a heated debate in the athletic world. </p> <p>Dowling, a writer and lecturer whose first book, You Mean I Don't Have To Feel This Way, became the bible for women suffering depression, has for the past two decades carved out a respected niche writing about the psychosocial issues of American women. Her 1981 book The Cinderella Complex, castigating females who live in the expectation that men will rescue them, has never gone out of print. </p> <p>In her new book Dowling pulls together research from physiology, biology and psychology to suggest that not only are women as capable as men of excelling in sports, it is their natural inclination to do so. </p> <p>The reason there aren't more Marion Joneses, she says, is not because women can't or won't compete. Rather, she paints women as victims of a vast conspiracy to keep them off the playing field. To blame are a culture of misogyny, parents and teachers who pander to gender stereotypes, and a media that rewards women for looking weak and feminine, and excoriates them when they display strength. \"Women have been excluded from so much in life because of the frailty myth,\" she writes. \"First we believed we were weak. Then we began to suspect that we weren't but kept getting told that we were. Then we began proving that we weren't and were mocked as men because we were strong. </p> <p>\"Women have thrown themselves over hurdle after hurdle during the course of the past century, demonstrating extraordinary physical powers and skills, and still we're being kept back for no reason other than we're female.\" </p> <p>The book is a powerful clarion call to both sexes, demanding they abandon the old saw that women are the weaker sex. She argues that the belief female-equals-frail has done untold damage to women's health, self-esteem, and social status. Physical equality, she warns complacent feminists, is the real final frontier of women's liberation. </p> <p>To make her argument stick, Dowling draws on research in exercise physiology, which proves there are no biological reasons for women to stay off the sporting field. She slaps the wrists of 19th century doctors who insisted \"weakness\" in women was a natural condition, and that exercise was a danger that might dislodge the uterus. </p> <p>Instead Dowling explains that before puberty, boys are neither taller nor heavier than girls. And whereas it was long thought that only boys experienced a muscle-building surge of testosterone during puberty, girls do too. Modern medicine knows this, so why, she asks, given their ability to develop athletically, did women never venture beyond sewing, cooking and Barbies? </p> <p>Dowling says the answer is cultural, and continues to be. Frailty has long been sold to women as feminine. \"Strength has a withering effect on male identity. To salvage men's failing sense of dominance (post industrial revolution) women were encouraged to scale back their own physical development.\" She believes that men's psyches have taken a beating, first with machines displacing them, and, more recently, with the influx of women into the workforce.

Fathers, she says, still teach their sons to play catch, but not their daughters, who they put in the \"doll corner\". But, she claims, when they do teach their girls to throw, they learn just as competently as boys. \"Boys throw better simply because they are trained to from childhood.\" </p> <p>Stacy Dragila, who is competing for the United States in the pole vault in Sydney, recounted recently that when she asked a man if she could vault, he looked at her as if she was from Mars. \"I asked him if I could try it one day at practice.

They are not made to do it.'\" </p> <p>But Dowling insists they are, if only the culture would read the biological data, rid themselves of gender stereotypes, and see the benefits. Sport, she says, stimulates motor development in the brain. It has also been shown to build self-esteem and curb self-destructive behaviour in young girls such as smoking and drinking. </p> <p>In The Frailty Myth, Dowling pleads a passionate and well-argued case to let women play ball, except in two instances, when her reasoning is more about sexual politics than logic. Yes, science has shown women have innate athletic abilities. Yes, feminists and behavioural psychologists will confirm that women are held back, and hold themselves back, to conform to male notions of femininity. </p> <p>But to suggest that if men suddenly declared big muscles sexy, women would storm the football field is plainly untrue. As the noted American anthropologist Helen Fisher argues in her book The First Sex - The Natural Talents of Women and How They are Changing the World, girls will never be as obsessed with sports as boys, because evolution wires women to be co-operators, not competitors. </p> <p>\"Nobody pushes girls into the doll corner - they go there naturally,\" she says. \"Throughout their lifecycle, girls show more tendency toward nurturing activities, and we believe this is linked to the production of oestrogen. It's amazing how many people have to try to prove that everything is all socialisation, whereas biology and culture go hand in hand.\" </p> <p>Fisher applauds Dowling's call to get women playing at elite levels like men, but does not accept the notion that women hunger to play sports in massive numbers. \"There are more women who will play sports when the culture makes it acceptable to be athletic, which we see is now happening. But girls will always go to the doll corner. Women are drawn to activities that involve nurturing and co-operation, and men competition, and that is pure biology. You can't discount it.\" </p> <p>Dowling's other argument raising eyebrows is her call to reassess the performance of women in competition. She won't accept that men are better athletes because they can jump higher and run faster. To really compare the sexes, she wants women's performance relative to men's adjusted to take into account their smaller size. </p> <p>\"That just doesn't add up,\" says Richard Cotton, exercise physiologist and spokesman for ACE, the American Council on Exercise. \"You can't adjust performance to size to determine which athlete is superior. It would be a huge leap to say that Flo-Jo, [sprinter Florence Griffith-Joyner], at her peak, was faster than Michael Johnson at his, simply because you divide her size and speed and average out the maths. </p> <p>\"In terms of physiology, men are genetically predisposed to have more strength than women. Venus Williams is a big girl, but she still couldn't take on Pete Sampras, due to genetics. I would venture to say she wouldn't even make the men's tour.\" </p> <p>But Cotton says Dowling is correct in that biology doesn't prevent women pole vaulting or boxing. \"Women can definitely build strength, and they have excellent athletic ability when trained. But we do encourage girls to stay indoors because as a culture we don't like muscular women. Yet I think that stereotype is breaking down.\" </p> <p>This Dowling concedes too. She waxes lyrical over the strides American women have made in sports since 1972, when Title IX, an amendment to the Civil Rights Act guaranteeing equal funding for girls and boys sports, went into law.

Today there are 3.2m.) </p> <p>Throw in society's attitudes breaking down about women athletes and television networks smelling profits in women's games, and Dowling admits these seem like glory days for women athletes. So why isn't she doing a victory lap? Simply because she doesn't see the battle won.

      "bodyText": "Marion Jones wants to be the Mark Spitz of the 21st century. The 24-year-old track and field star plans to win five gold medals at the Olympics next month, setting a new record in athletics the way Spitz, with seven in 1972, set it in swimming. It may well happen, for Jones, currently the fastest female in the world, clearly has the talent. But she also has a confidence, many say arrogance, that is pushing people's buttons in a way unseen before. From the beginning, Jones did not dare to suggest, wish, or hope she might win five medals. She declared it a certainty. Even to a public shed of many sexist attitudes about women being non-starters in sports - witness the hysteria following the US women's football team winning the World Cup, the Spice Girls-like adulation for the Williams sisters at Wimbledon - Jones is too much. She is too boastful, too assertive, too cocksure she will bring home the gold. In short, she is displaying character traits Americans ascribe to male athletes. But in men the chest-thumping is admired. In women, it is shocking, and has led to Jones being called arrogant, pretentious, and a certain word that rhymes with rich. But Jones won't apologise for her bravado, and nor should she, suggests Colette Dowling, author of an audacious new book about women and sports, The Frailty Myth. Though not published until September, it has already sparked a heated debate in the athletic world. Dowling, a writer and lecturer whose first book, You Mean I Don't Have To Feel This Way, became the bible for women suffering depression, has for the past two decades carved out a respected niche writing about the psychosocial issues of American women. Her 1981 book The Cinderella Complex, castigating females who live in the expectation that men will rescue them, has never gone out of print. In her new book Dowling pulls together research from physiology, biology and psychology to suggest that not only are women as capable as men of excelling in sports, it is their natural inclination to do so. The reason there aren't more Marion Joneses, she says, is not because women can't or won't compete. Rather, she paints women as victims of a vast conspiracy to keep them off the playing field. To blame are a culture of misogyny, parents and teachers who pander to gender stereotypes, and a media that rewards women for looking weak and feminine, and excoriates them when they display strength. \"Women have been excluded from so much in life because of the frailty myth,\" she writes. \"First we believed we were weak. Then we began to suspect that we weren't but kept getting told that we were. Then we began proving that we weren't and were mocked as men because we were strong. \"Women have thrown themselves over hurdle after hurdle during the course of the past century, demonstrating extraordinary physical powers and skills, and still we're being kept back for no reason other than we're female.\" The book is a powerful clarion call to both sexes, demanding they abandon the old saw that women are the weaker sex. She argues that the belief female-equals-frail has done untold damage to women's health, self-esteem, and social status. Physical equality, she warns complacent feminists, is the real final frontier of women's liberation. To make her argument stick, Dowling draws on research in exercise physiology, which proves there are no biological reasons for women to stay off the sporting field. She slaps the wrists of 19th century doctors who insisted \"weakness\" in women was a natural condition, and that exercise was a danger that might dislodge the uterus. Instead Dowling explains that before puberty, boys are neither taller nor heavier than girls. And whereas it was long thought that only boys experienced a muscle-building surge of testosterone during puberty, girls do too. Modern medicine knows this, so why, she asks, given their ability to develop athletically, did women never venture beyond sewing, cooking and Barbies? Dowling says the answer is cultural, and continues to be. Frailty has long been sold to women as feminine. \"Strength has a withering effect on male identity. To salvage men's failing sense of dominance (post industrial revolution) women were encouraged to scale back their own physical development.\" She believes that men's psyches have taken a beating, first with machines displacing them, and, more recently, with the influx of women into the workforce. She contends that sport is the last place that men, no longer supremely dominant, can assert their body strength and masculinity. That is why, she argues, the frailty myth endures, despite the leaps women have taken in professional sport in the past decade. Men need to keep women weak, off the football field and out of the boxing ring, so they can continue to feel strong. They do this by criticising muscular women, announcing they are unfeminine, whispering that they are probably lesbians. Teenage girls in particular, living in a culture that glorifies whippet-thin models as the benchmark in femininity, sexiness and glamour, quickly get the message that boys don't like muscles and strength. \"Girls who display strength, power or physicality while interacting with boys run the risks of being marginalised.\" Dowling says that girls learn this long before they start reading Vogue.

Then came a turning point, which was followed by an amazing late summer of creativity. By the mid-1980s, he had risen to a commanding status in the modernist wing of contemporary music, on a par with his great contemporary, Luciano Berio.</p> <p>In the 1950s, while the young Turks of the musical avant-garde - men like Boulez, Stockhausen and Berio - were investigating electronic music and total serialism, Donatoni was writing in a comparatively safe neo-classical style, with a strong flavour of Bartok. Up to that point, his training had been conventional, and he had shown no particular sign of the radical he was to become.</p> <p>He first studied music in his home town of Verona, and later at the Verdi Conservatory, in Milan, and the Martini Conservatory, in Bologna. Then, in 1953, came a crucial meeting with Bruno Maderna, who introduced Donatoni to the music of Webern and the avant-garde. For a while, Donatoni moved in their direction, but he always had reservations, summed up in his remark about Stockhausen: \"My distance from Stockhausen, despite my admiration, is that he is always perfecting his ego and his music, while I want to destroy both the one and the other.\"</p> <p>Donatoni's hatred of the ego was not some mystical desire to merge with the infinite. It was more a keen, almost agonised, awareness that the unity of a work of art could no longer be equated with self-expression - because, in these post-Freudian times, the self had become a slippery and dubious thing. Self, society and works of art had, in the past, been mutually defining and reinforcing; now they had drifted apart.</p> <p>As Donatoni put it, \"One can no longer say 'le style c'est l'homme.'\" So where was \"style\" to be found? At first, it seemed that total serialism would give music that hard, objective quality once bestowed by a style, and so be the key to escaping the self. But then a better route appeared to offer itself in the early 1960s, when Donatoni fell under the spell of John Cage.</p> <p>Thus began his negative period, in which he pursued Cage's ideas of chance and \"abnegation of the will\" to a kind of reductio ad absurdum. He bypassed the ego by the simple expedient of quarrying other pieces for musical material, and then subjecting it to a process of systematic distortion and transformation.</p> <p>Sometimes, the effect can be curiously moving, as in Etwas Ruhiger In Ausdruck (Somewhat More Peaceful In Expression), based on a tiny fragment of a Schoenberg piano piece. Other works of this period are distressingly self-destructive, pursuing their processes of transformation to the point of chaotic overload. Donatoni was proving his own misgivings that the absence of form in Cage's music \"was putting music in great danger, so that its survival as an art was being put into doubt\".</p> <p>By the mid-1970s, Donatoni had abandoned composition, and only relented when his wife pleaded with him to accept a commission for a new chamber piece. The composition that resulted was Spiri, for 10 instruments, and it unlocked the door to an unforeseen musical territory. The state of euphoria that its composition engendered can be heard in the wit and sparkling invention of the music. The arcane systems of codes (rules for transforming one kind of music into another) are not abandoned, but are here applied to genuine melodic lines, often of a brusque and startling simplicity.</p> <p>New pieces followed at an astonishing rate; in 1983 alone, there were no fewer than 10. Donatoni preferred the medium of chamber music; he wrote many brilliantly inventive pieces for solo instruments - piccolo and double bass were favourites - and for novel chamber groupings. There was also a handful of fine orchestral pieces, with one still to come: a 15-minute piece for the BBC Symphony Orchestra, entitled Prom, to be premiered next May at the Barbican Centre. (The title is a wry reference to a misunderstanding; the composer assumed wrongly that the piece had been commissioned for the BBC promenade concerts.)</p> <p>There were no operas, which points to a certain narrowness in the human dimension of Donatoni's music - a narrowness shared by several other leading lights of postwar modernist music, notably Boulez and, until recently, Elliott Carter.

      "body": "<p>A New York Times book reviewer once noted that the detective writer Patricia Moyes, who has died aged 77, \"made drug dealing look like bad manners rather than bad morals\".</p> <p>Hers was a cosy genre of classic crime fiction, which continues to be successful in the United States while languishing in Britain, where most of her books are out of print. Earlier in her career, she had been a radar operator in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF), an assistant to Peter Ustinov, a scriptwriter, translator and Vogue jounalist.</p> <p>Moyes, was the creator of the imperturbable and engaging Scotland Yard detective, Henry Tibbett (initially chief inspector, and eventually detective chief superintendent), and his cheerful, but formidable, Dutch wife, Emmy. Tibbett features in 19 novels, from Dead Men Don't Ski (1959) to Twice In A Blue Moon (1993). Many Deadly Returns (1970) won the Edgar Allan Poe Special Award from the Mystery Writers of America.</p> <p>The books were written in the well-established tradition of British detective fiction, in which solving the crime is the focus rather than the crime itself. But Moyes's perspective was international: she lived in France, Switzerland, Holland and the United States, before moving to the British Virgin Islands, where she died, and drew on her experiences of these places.</p> <p>Patricia Pakenham-Walsh was born in Dublin; her father was in the Indian civil service and retired in 1938 as a high court judge in Madras. Penny (as she was always known) was educated at Overstone girls' school, Northampton, where she was an exceptional pupil. At 15, she sat an entrance examination for Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford; the examiner stated that her papers were as good as any, but that she was far too young and should reapply.</p> <p>When war came in 1939, Moyes added a year to her age in order to join the WAAF. She had always wanted to write and, while a flight officer, wrote review sketches for barrack concerts. Peter Ustinov invited her to be his technical assistant on the film, School For Secrets (1946) about the search and discovery of radar. They became friends, and she later became his personal assistant for eight years.</p> <p>Moyes's translation of Jean Anouilh's play, Leocadia, was produced in 1957 in London and on Broadway, as Time Remembered, starring Richard Burton and Helen Hayes. She was assistant editor on Vogue (1953-58), and in 1960 collaborated on the script of School For Scoundrels, based on Stephen Potter's books, One Upmanship and Lifemanship. With the success of Time Remembered, she moved to France, where she wrote her first novel while recovering from a skiing accident.</p> <p>After the break-up of her first marriage (1951-59) to photographer John Moyes, she married James Haszard, a lawyer and interpreter at the international court of justice in The Hague. The couple were renowned sailors and skiers, and Haszard only accepted his posting in the early 1970s, to the International Monetary Fund in Washington, on condition that their boat, wine cellar and cats were transported there too. On Jim's retirement, they settled in Virgin Gorda, where he died in 1994.</p> <p>Penny loved cats, and, on Virgin Gorda, she was involved in a campaign to innoculate, treat and spay the wild cat population. Cats featured in many of her writings, and she wrote two books specifically about them: After All They're Only Cats (1973), and How To Talk To Your Cat (1991).</p> <p><b> Jenny Chamier Grove writes: </b> <br></p> <p>Patricia Moyes's knowledge of radar was partly responsible for her first steps as a writer.</p> <p>One night, the Air Ministry sent a signal asking for names of people with film script-writing experience and knowledge of radar. Patricia, who had worked on state-of-the-art short wavelength radar, but had never so much as seen a film script, looked longingly at the message, wishing she had the qualifications to apply. Next day, her commanding officer told her he had submitted her name. \"Sir, you're crazy!\" she said - but she got the job with Peter Ustinov.</p> <p>She had a sharp eye for material for use in her plots; a chat with \"a very nice greyhound trainer\" in Surrey led to The Curious Affair Of The Third Dog (1986), and tips from a parasailing instructor in Jamaica came in useful for Black Girl White Girl (1990).</p> <p>It was in a mystery bookshop in New York that she first met the crime writer Sarah Caudwell (Obituary, February 8).

      "bodyText": "A New York Times book reviewer once noted that the detective writer Patricia Moyes, who has died aged 77, \"made drug dealing look like bad manners rather than bad morals\". Hers was a cosy genre of classic crime fiction, which continues to be successful in the United States while languishing in Britain, where most of her books are out of print. Earlier in her career, she had been a radar operator in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF), an assistant to Peter Ustinov, a scriptwriter, translator and Vogue jounalist. Moyes, was the creator of the imperturbable and engaging Scotland Yard detective, Henry Tibbett (initially chief inspector, and eventually detective chief superintendent), and his cheerful, but formidable, Dutch wife, Emmy. Tibbett features in 19 novels, from Dead Men Don't Ski (1959) to Twice In A Blue Moon (1993). Many Deadly Returns (1970) won the Edgar Allan Poe Special Award from the Mystery Writers of America. The books were written in the well-established tradition of British detective fiction, in which solving the crime is the focus rather than the crime itself. But Moyes's perspective was international: she lived in France, Switzerland, Holland and the United States, before moving to the British Virgin Islands, where she died, and drew on her experiences of these places. Patricia Pakenham-Walsh was born in Dublin; her father was in the Indian civil service and retired in 1938 as a high court judge in Madras. Penny (as she was always known) was educated at Overstone girls' school, Northampton, where she was an exceptional pupil. At 15, she sat an entrance examination for Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford; the examiner stated that her papers were as good as any, but that she was far too young and should reapply. When war came in 1939, Moyes added a year to her age in order to join the WAAF. She had always wanted to write and, while a flight officer, wrote review sketches for barrack concerts. Peter Ustinov invited her to be his technical assistant on the film, School For Secrets (1946) about the search and discovery of radar. They became friends, and she later became his personal assistant for eight years. Moyes's translation of Jean Anouilh's play, Leocadia, was produced in 1957 in London and on Broadway, as Time Remembered, starring Richard Burton and Helen Hayes. She was assistant editor on Vogue (1953-58), and in 1960 collaborated on the script of School For Scoundrels, based on Stephen Potter's books, One Upmanship and Lifemanship. With the success of Time Remembered, she moved to France, where she wrote her first novel while recovering from a skiing accident. After the break-up of her first marriage (1951-59) to photographer John Moyes, she married James Haszard, a lawyer and interpreter at the international court of justice in The Hague. The couple were renowned sailors and skiers, and Haszard only accepted his posting in the early 1970s, to the International Monetary Fund in Washington, on condition that their boat, wine cellar and cats were transported there too. On Jim's retirement, they settled in Virgin Gorda, where he died in 1994. Penny loved cats, and, on Virgin Gorda, she was involved in a campaign to innoculate, treat and spay the wild cat population. Cats featured in many of her writings, and she wrote two books specifically about them: After All They're Only Cats (1973), and How To Talk To Your Cat (1991). Jenny Chamier Grove writes: Patricia Moyes's knowledge of radar was partly responsible for her first steps as a writer. One night, the Air Ministry sent a signal asking for names of people with film script-writing experience and knowledge of radar. Patricia, who had worked on state-of-the-art short wavelength radar, but had never so much as seen a film script, looked longingly at the message, wishing she had the qualifications to apply. Next day, her commanding officer told her he had submitted her name. \"Sir, you're crazy!\" she said - but she got the job with Peter Ustinov. She had a sharp eye for material for use in her plots; a chat with \"a very nice greyhound trainer\" in Surrey led to The Curious Affair Of The Third Dog (1986), and tips from a parasailing instructor in Jamaica came in useful for Black Girl White Girl (1990). It was in a mystery bookshop in New York that she first met the crime writer Sarah Caudwell (Obituary, February 8). The two established an instant rapport, and soon managed to combine forces for book-signing tours. \"We laughed our way all across the United States,\" Patricia told me later. Friends thought them alike. They both eschewed the mean streets and wrote about murders among the well-mannered middle classes, but while Sarah tended to be vague and academic - puffing on her pipe and talking about Catullus - Patricia was practical, and made sure that they always arrived on time. Even so, on one tour of the US, Sarah contrived to lose her travellers' cheques, passport, return ticket to England and raincoat. Slightly annoyed, Patricia expostulated. Sarah remained placid. Eventually documents - and equanimity - were restored. \"Sarah might have been less calm if she'd lost her pipe,\" Patricia commented later. \u0095 Patricia 'Penny' Moyes (Haszard), writer, born January 19 1923; August 2 2000",

All England had to do was lose a wicket in South Africa last winter and Ian Botham would come over all bumptious on Sky TV. \"Solanki's scoring runs,\" he would thunder. \"Get him out here. Bring him in.\" </p> <p>England did just that, and the reputation that had burgeoned on an England A tour in Bangladesh shrunk back again. The frustration of that limited-overs series has remained throughout a generally unproductive summer. Solanki's has been a name to utter with a sigh, a lavish talent refusing to ripen. </p> <p>Solanki's second championship hundred of the season yesterday, an unbeaten 113 after Worcestershire's first three wickets had disappeared for eight runs, offered plenty of enchantment. But it is difficult to see, another A tour apart, where England can accommodate him this winter. </p> <p>It was a cultured and slightly chancy affair, and he should have been caught in the gully off Dougie Brown when 81. Typical Solanki, you might surmise. Typical Worcester would be more to the point; this was another unreliable pitch to bat on and Solanki's frailties cannot be blamed entirely on his own shortcomings. </p> <p>The Second Division could hardly be tighter. Back-to-back derbies between these two sides in the next fortnight will heavily influence whether they will be in the shake-up. Neither of the current top two, Northamptonshire and Essex, smack of invincibility, while only eight points separate third-placed Sussex and bottom side Gloucestershire. </p> <p>In such a competitive atmosphere, it is a surprise to discover Warwickshire carrying a host of traditional pre-final injuries. Nick Knight's knee is the biggest concern ahead of Saturday's NatWest Trophy final, but anyone worried about whether Dominic Ostler, Ashley Giles and Allan Donald will make it would be better advised to fret about more pressing matters, such as whether they have put the milk bottles out. </p> <p>Ed Giddins hustled out both Worcestershire openers, Alan Richardson removed Graeme Hick for nought, and Graeme Welch had David Leatherdale lbw just before lunch to add a third championship wicket to a dismal season. </p> <p>That paved the way for a maiden championship innings for David Pipe, earmarked as the eventual wicketkeeping successor to Steve Rhodes, a fellow Yorkie. Pipe hails from Queensbury, a windswept summit west of Bradford, and his Queensbury rules involved a marvellous counter-punching 54, with 10 fours and a six, which made Solanki look comparatively ponderous. </p> <p>\u0095 Justin Langer's unbeaten 76 put him on target for three centuries in as many matches as Middlesex struggled to 151 for five before rain interrupted their Second Division bottom-of-the-table dogfight against Gloucestershire at Bristol.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Vikram Solanki. Now that was a name once deemed worthy of all kinds of excitement. All England had to do was lose a wicket in South Africa last winter and Ian Botham would come over all bumptious on Sky TV. \"Solanki's scoring runs,\" he would thunder. \"Get him out here. Bring him in.\" England did just that, and the reputation that had burgeoned on an England A tour in Bangladesh shrunk back again. The frustration of that limited-overs series has remained throughout a generally unproductive summer. Solanki's has been a name to utter with a sigh, a lavish talent refusing to ripen. Solanki's second championship hundred of the season yesterday, an unbeaten 113 after Worcestershire's first three wickets had disappeared for eight runs, offered plenty of enchantment. But it is difficult to see, another A tour apart, where England can accommodate him this winter. It was a cultured and slightly chancy affair, and he should have been caught in the gully off Dougie Brown when 81. Typical Solanki, you might surmise. Typical Worcester would be more to the point; this was another unreliable pitch to bat on and Solanki's frailties cannot be blamed entirely on his own shortcomings. The Second Division could hardly be tighter. Back-to-back derbies between these two sides in the next fortnight will heavily influence whether they will be in the shake-up. Neither of the current top two, Northamptonshire and Essex, smack of invincibility, while only eight points separate third-placed Sussex and bottom side Gloucestershire. In such a competitive atmosphere, it is a surprise to discover Warwickshire carrying a host of traditional pre-final injuries. Nick Knight's knee is the biggest concern ahead of Saturday's NatWest Trophy final, but anyone worried about whether Dominic Ostler, Ashley Giles and Allan Donald will make it would be better advised to fret about more pressing matters, such as whether they have put the milk bottles out. Ed Giddins hustled out both Worcestershire openers, Alan Richardson removed Graeme Hick for nought, and Graeme Welch had David Leatherdale lbw just before lunch to add a third championship wicket to a dismal season. That paved the way for a maiden championship innings for David Pipe, earmarked as the eventual wicketkeeping successor to Steve Rhodes, a fellow Yorkie. Pipe hails from Queensbury, a windswept summit west of Bradford, and his Queensbury rules involved a marvellous counter-punching 54, with 10 fours and a six, which made Solanki look comparatively ponderous. \u0095 Justin Langer's unbeaten 76 put him on target for three centuries in as many matches as Middlesex struggled to 151 for five before rain interrupted their Second Division bottom-of-the-table dogfight against Gloucestershire at Bristol.",
