Valencia, aware that Fiorentina are beating Bordeaux 3-1 in the other Group B fixture, now know that a point will be enough to keep them in front of Fiorentina. The Spanish side seem content to play a dangerous game of relying on Claudio Lopez up front to break down a United side that, knowing they probably have the group sown up, are content to bide their time and await their chances. Only a goal from United can deny Valencia qualification. <br> <strong>68 Substitution Man Utd</strong> Cruyff on for Solskjaer.<br> <strong>71 Substitution Valencia</strong> ILie on for Sanchez.<br><strong>73</strong> Not much of a game to speak of.

That said Team United also appear content to do the minimum. <br> <strong>80</strong> Valencia win a corner but both teams are happy return the ball to the centre of the park as soon as possible. A more crashing contrast to the first half there could not have been.<br> <strong>87</strong> No change. Still 22 players who show no signs of being bored at passing the ball around aimlessly for 20 minutes. Kily Gonzalez is the only Valencia player who appears to have any sense of glory in his mind when he cuts inside the United area and lays on a shooting opportunity that bears more resemblance to a rocket launch. Stunning stuff! <br> <strong>90</strong> Barely no extra time played as referee Lubos, able to take the excruciating tedium no longer, blows for time. Valencia 0 - 0 Man Utd. The other match in Group B finished Fiorentina 3 - 3 Bordeaux. Valencia finsh the group two points clear of Fiorentina and therefore join United in the quarter-finals.<br></p>",

The Spanish side seem content to play a dangerous game of relying on Claudio Lopez up front to break down a United side that, knowing they probably have the group sown up, are content to bide their time and await their chances. Only a goal from United can deny Valencia qualification. 68 Substitution Man Utd Cruyff on for Solskjaer. 71 Substitution Valencia ILie on for Sanchez. 73 Not much of a game to speak of. The home fans are getting frustated that their team are happy to settle for a point, while Fortune gamely tries to inject some life back in to the match by taking all of his chances to race away down the left. 75 Claudio Lopez screams at his players in an attempt to motivate them towards a fighting result, or perhaps he is just pointing out that should United go for a customary late winner, they will be stuffed. 79 Fortune continues to niggle at the Valencia defence and do his bit to remind the home side that it isn't over until it's over. That said Team United also appear content to do the minimum. 80 Valencia win a corner but both teams are happy return the ball to the centre of the park as soon as possible. A more crashing contrast to the first half there could not have been. 87 No change. Still 22 players who show no signs of being bored at passing the ball around aimlessly for 20 minutes. Kily Gonzalez is the only Valencia player who appears to have any sense of glory in his mind when he cuts inside the United area and lays on a shooting opportunity that bears more resemblance to a rocket launch. Stunning stuff! 90 Barely no extra time played as referee Lubos, able to take the excruciating tedium no longer, blows for time. Valencia 0 - 0 Man Utd. The other match in Group B finished Fiorentina 3 - 3 Bordeaux. Valencia finsh the group two points clear of Fiorentina and therefore join United in the quarter-finals.",

      "byline": "Harry Pearson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Those of us who believed that the only important thing a footballer's fingers were ever likely to indicate was the belief that those barracking him should go forth, be fruitful and multiply, may have to think again. New research posits the most unlikely link between a player's digits and his performance since David James blamed Nintendo addiction for a shambolic goalkeeping display. </p> <p>A joint (or perhaps that should be knuckle) study at Liverpool University by the School of Biological Sciences and the Football Research Unit suggests a direct correlation between success on the field and the relative sizes of the third and index finger. </p> <p>Male hormones are the key. Men whose ring fingers are larger than their pointing fingers apparently had more testosterone when they were in the womb than those with the more usually proportioned digits. Testosterone is said by some scientists to be linked not just to strength and cardiovascular fitness but also to spatial awareness. This latter has always been an opinion championed by certain people, usually those graduates of the University of Life who insist that women cannot park cars properly, though there is about as much conclusive proof on the subject as there is that oestrogen levels affect the human ability to concentrate on Meg Ryan movies. </p> <p>The theory is that the whole football-finger thing may be to do with sexual selection. Why the notoriously quirky Mother Nature should have chosen this strange digital formation to indicate alpha males rather than something more obvious to passing females such as a huge nose or feet the size of flippers is anybody's guess. Though, given the behaviour of top soccer stars of the 1970s, the help it would provide in twisting the wire from a champagne cork while simultaneously unlatching the brassiere of a top actress/model cannot be discounted. </p> <p>To those of us who are totally inept at sport the notion that success might simply rest on a quirk of biology while we were as yet unborn is, of course, a comforting one. Despite this my knee-jerk reaction to such ideas is, well, to jerk my knee into them. For, as anybody who has ever been bearded by a saloon-bar philosopher will know, the phrase \"It's only natural, innit?\" tends to lead in only one direction, towards the far right. </p> <p>It should be stressed that the research has absolutely no racial element. Sadly when it comes to theorising about the part physiology plays in sporting success this is not always true. The idea that a black sportsman's winning performance is based on the width of his hips, the length of his thighbone or whatever has been floated at regular intervals. </p> <p>Strangely, though, the reverse never seems to happen. This is a pity in many respects. I for one would certainly be delighted if the University of Nairobi produced a report on how the peculiar structure of the British shoulder has stopped us producing a really fast bowler or a brilliant tennis player for so long. Until they do we shall just have to struggle on in the belief that it is all down to some terrible deficiency in our national character. </p> <p>The other problem with the findings is that they completely ignore the ginger-counter-reactive principle. Red-haired people are often thought of as quick-tempered or prone to violence. Think of John Hartson, Alan Ball, Billy Bremner or any number of mercurial Scottish wingers. My mother has red-hair and she has a theory as to why this might be. \"If you'd been called carrot-top since you were three years old, you'd be forever losing your rag,\" she explains between gritted teeth. </p> <p>This might be a hypothesis worth testing out by researchers. For many years now I have been puzzled by the unnatural percentage of top sportsmen who combine muscular physical stature with high-pitched voices. Graham Gooch, Tony Adams, Emlyn Hughes, Mike Tyson and Herol Graham spring to mind. Is it not possible that it is not too much testosterone that propels men to the top in sport but too little? </p> <p>Surely even an elementary knowledge of human psychology would suggest that it is more likely to be those individuals deprived of sufficient male hormones who would be the ones running about kicking one another and overcompensating like mad, while those of us with testosterone coursing around our veins by the tanker load, sit in darkened rooms all day trying to figure out why our modem is not working and repeatedly clicking the send button with our really remarkably long index fingers?</p>",

Men whose ring fingers are larger than their pointing fingers apparently had more testosterone when they were in the womb than those with the more usually proportioned digits. Testosterone is said by some scientists to be linked not just to strength and cardiovascular fitness but also to spatial awareness. This latter has always been an opinion championed by certain people, usually those graduates of the University of Life who insist that women cannot park cars properly, though there is about as much conclusive proof on the subject as there is that oestrogen levels affect the human ability to concentrate on Meg Ryan movies. The theory is that the whole football-finger thing may be to do with sexual selection. Why the notoriously quirky Mother Nature should have chosen this strange digital formation to indicate alpha males rather than something more obvious to passing females such as a huge nose or feet the size of flippers is anybody's guess. Though, given the behaviour of top soccer stars of the 1970s, the help it would provide in twisting the wire from a champagne cork while simultaneously unlatching the brassiere of a top actress/model cannot be discounted. To those of us who are totally inept at sport the notion that success might simply rest on a quirk of biology while we were as yet unborn is, of course, a comforting one. Despite this my knee-jerk reaction to such ideas is, well, to jerk my knee into them. For, as anybody who has ever been bearded by a saloon-bar philosopher will know, the phrase \"It's only natural, innit?\" tends to lead in only one direction, towards the far right. It should be stressed that the research has absolutely no racial element. Sadly when it comes to theorising about the part physiology plays in sporting success this is not always true. The idea that a black sportsman's winning performance is based on the width of his hips, the length of his thighbone or whatever has been floated at regular intervals. Strangely, though, the reverse never seems to happen. This is a pity in many respects. I for one would certainly be delighted if the University of Nairobi produced a report on how the peculiar structure of the British shoulder has stopped us producing a really fast bowler or a brilliant tennis player for so long. Until they do we shall just have to struggle on in the belief that it is all down to some terrible deficiency in our national character. The other problem with the findings is that they completely ignore the ginger-counter-reactive principle. Red-haired people are often thought of as quick-tempered or prone to violence. Think of John Hartson, Alan Ball, Billy Bremner or any number of mercurial Scottish wingers. My mother has red-hair and she has a theory as to why this might be. \"If you'd been called carrot-top since you were three years old, you'd be forever losing your rag,\" she explains between gritted teeth. This might be a hypothesis worth testing out by researchers. For many years now I have been puzzled by the unnatural percentage of top sportsmen who combine muscular physical stature with high-pitched voices. Graham Gooch, Tony Adams, Emlyn Hughes, Mike Tyson and Herol Graham spring to mind. Is it not possible that it is not too much testosterone that propels men to the top in sport but too little? Surely even an elementary knowledge of human psychology would suggest that it is more likely to be those individuals deprived of sufficient male hormones who would be the ones running about kicking one another and overcompensating like mad, while those of us with testosterone coursing around our veins by the tanker load, sit in darkened rooms all day trying to figure out why our modem is not working and repeatedly clicking the send button with our really remarkably long index fingers?",

Last year its NI liability was just \u00a3200,000, but as Axon\u0092s share price has jumped 500% over the past year, the liability in the next tax year would be \u00a31m, making a huge dent in its profits of \u00a34.5m.</p> <p>The company, which started in 1995 and now employs 200 people, designs B2B solutions for blue chip clients such as Orange and BP Amoco. The issue has hit thousands of small net start-ups which have used share options to incentivise staff and have seen their share prices soar.</p> <p>Accountants have warned that many are effectively insolvent as a result of having to put aside reserves for future NI payments on options when they are exercised. But the chancellor said yesterday that he will begin an urgent consultation exercise to reduce the NI burden.</p> <p>Early indications are that employers will be allowed to transfer their NI liability on to employees.

      "bodyText": "Axon, an e-commerce company based in Surrey, was yesterday celebrating a potential \u00a31m gain from the Budget after the chancellor promised action to remove a catch-22 problem which has left start-up companies creaking under huge national insurance liabilities. Until yesterday Axon was facing a \u00a31m bill to pay for employer\u0092s NI when its staff exercise share options. Last year its NI liability was just \u00a3200,000, but as Axon\u0092s share price has jumped 500% over the past year, the liability in the next tax year would be \u00a31m, making a huge dent in its profits of \u00a34.5m. The company, which started in 1995 and now employs 200 people, designs B2B solutions for blue chip clients such as Orange and BP Amoco. The issue has hit thousands of small net start-ups which have used share options to incentivise staff and have seen their share prices soar. Accountants have warned that many are effectively insolvent as a result of having to put aside reserves for future NI payments on options when they are exercised. But the chancellor said yesterday that he will begin an urgent consultation exercise to reduce the NI burden. Early indications are that employers will be allowed to transfer their NI liability on to employees. An employee exercising an option is likely in future to have to pay not just the marginal tax rate but also their employer\u0092s NI bill of 11.7%, producing a maximum tax bill of 51.7%. Axon finance director Robin Halliday said: \u0093It sounds like very positive news for employers, but the devil is in the detail. NI has been a huge issue for us; it\u0092s been like a tax on success. We\u0092re excited about what he\u0092s promising, but you often find with Budgets that when you look at the fine print, what you originally expected is not there.\u0094 But the extra tax burden on staff means that employers are likely to be forced to grant extra options to compensate, warned tax specialist Rose Edmunds of accountants Grant Thornton.

The chancellor is spending \u00a3280m on <b>transport</b>.</p> <p>\u0095 The cost of 20 cigarettes will rise by 25p and the extra revenue will, Mr Brown promised, go straight to the NHS.

This means abolishing the withholding tax on the interest paid on international bonds.

Thirty per cent of research and development costs will be met by the treasury.

If companies file tax returns electronically, they will receive a \u00a3100 tax cut.</p> <p>\u0095 The New Deal will be extended to include long-term unemployed adults.

A <b>new job grant</b> of \u00a3100 will be introduced.</p> <p>\u0095 Sure-Start <b>maternity grants</b> will rise from \u00a3200 to \u00a3300.</p> <p>\u0095 <b>Child benefit</b> for the first child is up to \u00a315.50 a week from April 2001, although there is a maximum of \u00a350 per family.

The chancellor is spending \u00a3280m on transport. \u0095 The cost of 20 cigarettes will rise by 25p and the extra revenue will, Mr Brown promised, go straight to the NHS. There will be further measures to combat tobacco smuggling. \u0095 There are small rises in alcohol taxes. A pint of beer will cost 1p more, a litre of cider 1p more and a bottle of wine 4p more. Spirits duty is frozen. \u0095 The Individual Savings Account (ISA) ceiling remains at \u00a37,000 - a boost for savers since it had been expected to drop to \u00a35,000. \u0095 Capital gains tax is to be radically reformed. In the first instance it will fall from 40% to 35% and subsequently to 10% after four years. All employee-shareholders will benefit from this cut. \u0095 The threshold for paying inheritance tax rises from \u00a3231,000 to \u00a3234,000, making 96% of the population exempt. \u0095 The chancellor wants to encourage more competition in UK banking. This means abolishing the withholding tax on the interest paid on international bonds. Initiatives involving the Post Office will make it easier for people to open bank accounts. \u0095 Small and medium-sized businesses will benefit from permanent 40% capital allowances. Thirty per cent of research and development costs will be met by the treasury. A regional innovation fund will be launched to encourage new businesses. \u0095 Mr Brown wants Britain to \"catch up with America\" on e-commerce as soon as possible. All small businesses will be able to write off tax on computer purchases during the next three years. If companies file tax returns electronically, they will receive a \u00a3100 tax cut. \u0095 The New Deal will be extended to include long-term unemployed adults. There will be tighter rules and penalties for the unemployed who \"fail to respond\" to job-finding initiatives. A new job grant of \u00a3100 will be introduced. \u0095 Sure-Start maternity grants will rise from \u00a3200 to \u00a3300. \u0095 Child benefit for the first child is up to \u00a315.50 a week from April 2001, although there is a maximum of \u00a350 per family. Mr Brown described this as the \"greatest reduction in child poverty in 50 years\" and said it would lift one million children out of poverty. \u0095 The Working Families Tax Credit will increase by 7% to guarantee a minimum income of \u00a3214 a week. \u0095 IT workers, who are in short supply in Europe, will find it easier to obtain work permits. \u0095 Tickets for charitable events will be exempt from VAT, and there will be tax relief on donations to charity and gifts of shares. \u0095 \"Thrifty\" pensioners with an occupational pension will be an average of \u00a3250 better off each year. Some will receive up to \u00a31,000 more. The chancellor announced a consultation on a new kind of pensioners' benefit and the television licence fee will be waived for every pensioner over 75. \u0095 The cut-off point for savings that prevent people from claiming income support is raised to \u00a312,000. \u0095 The VAT on tampons and other sanitary products falls from 17.5% to 5%.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A year ago the Government forecast the British economy would grow at 1-1.5 per cent.</p> <p>Today, I can report that in 1999, instead of the recession that many forecast, the British economy grew by 2 per cent.</p> <p>And Britain has been growing steadily while meeting our inflation target.</p> <p>Today inflation is 2.2 per cent.</p> <p>For the third year running inflation is in line with our target. And the target of 2.5 per cent - which I reaffirm - will be met this year, next year and the year after that.</p> <p>Because of the action we took in 1997 to stop inflation getting out of control, inflation in Britain has now been lower for longer than at any time since the 1960s.</p> <p>For almost thirty years, Britain's long term interest rates were, on average, 3 per cent higher than Germany's. Now British long term rates are down to the levels in Germany and today lower than in the USA.</p> <p>Amid the risks of an uncertain and often unstable global economy, we are determined to maintain our disciplined approach: determined not to make the old British mistakes of paying ourselves too much today at the cost of higher interest rates and fewer jobs tomorrow, determined not to make the old mistake of putting consumption before investment, the short term before the long term. Britain does not want a return to boom and bust.</p> <p>That is why the Bank of England has been right to take pre-emptive action on interest rates and to be vigilant on wage inflation.</p> <p>It is because the foundations on which we build are strong that the economy can meet our inflation target and achieve steady growth.</p> <p>Our forecast is that growth this year will rise to 2.75-3.25 per cent, and next year and the year after it is forecast to be 2.25 to 2.75 per cent - in line with our view of trend growth.</p> <p>Manufacturing is growing by 1.75 to 2.25 per cent this year and next.</p> <p>And business investment grew by 7.7 per cent last year to 14.5 per cent of national income, with Britain since 1998 for the first time investing more of our national income than our major European competitors, and more than America.</p> <p>This Budget is built on the realities of this new economy - that we will meet and master a new tide of unprecedented technological change by continuing to remove the old barriers to business investment and by continuing to expand employment opportunity for hard working families.</p> <p>I can report that unemployment today is at its lowest for 20 years, that there are 800,000 more people in work since 1997 and that there are one million vacancies on offer. Take-home pay is rising - by next year, for the typical family, a real terms rise in living standards of 10 per cent since 1997.</p> <p>Britain's economic success depends not only on monetary stability but on fiscal stability.</p> <p>Today, I can report that because of tough decisions to cut the deficit in our first two years and lower long term interest rates, debt interest payments will be four billion pounds a year lower.</p> <p>Because of the Welfare to Work reforms that have cut unemployment, social security spending on economic failure this year is a total of 3 billions less than the plans we inherited.</p> <p>Today, Mr Deputy Speaker, the state of the public finances is sound. In 1997 we inherited a current deficit exceeding 20 billion pounds. A year ago I estimated that this year's current surplus would be 2.5 billion pounds. I can report that we have not only balanced the current Budget but our current surplus this year is forecast to be 17 billion pounds.</p> <p>We have met and we will continue to meet, even on the most cautious of cases, our first rule of fiscal prudence, the golden rule. And we are also meeting our second rule, the sustainable investment rule.</p> <p>This year debt as a share of national income will fall well below the 44 per cent we inherited - to 37.1 per cent. Last year we forecast that the overall budget would be in deficit for this financial year - that public sector net borrowing would be 3 billion pounds.</p> <p>I can now report that due to the performance of the economy and to prudent management, the Budget is not in deficit by 3 billion but in surplus by 12 billion pounds.</p> <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, we inherited a deficit of 28 billion pounds in 1997. This year we will make a debt repayment of 12 billion pounds. Too often in the past, at the first sign of a cyclical surplus, governments have fallen back into imprudent ways.</p> <p>It is because we have learned from the mistakes of the last forty years that this Government will maintain its prudent and responsible approach. The figures I am announcing today show that we will meet our fiscal rules over the cycle. We will meet our fiscal rules even in the most cautious case, on the most cautious assumptions, including the most cautious view of trend growth at 2.25 per cent.</p> <p>And Mr Deputy Speaker, I can announce today that I have decided to lock in a greater fiscal tightening next year and the year after than we promised in last year's Budget and Pre-Budget Report.</p> <p>After the measures I announce today our projection is for a current surplus next year of 14 billion pounds and for the years after, surpluses of plus 16, plus 13, plus 8 and plus 8.

So from this stable platform of sound finances I am able to set out today our prudent and responsible approach for future years. Having met all of our fiscal rules, paid off 18 billions of debt this year and next, and locked in a greater fiscal tightening, we are able both to set a new envelope for public spending and investment for the years from 2001 and to cut taxes for hard working families.</p> <p>I can report that our fiscal rules enable us to increase current public spending by 2.5 per cent a year in real terms for the 3 years from 2001 and double net public investment as a share of national income from 0.9 per cent next year to 1.8 per cent in 2004.</p> <p>Mr Deputy Speaker, I have always said that our prudence is for a purpose.</p> <p>And in this Budget, because of our continuing prudence, we can now take the next steps towards that purpose - a Britain of opportunity and security not just for a few but for all:</p> <p>- with stability locked in, and enterprise growing, we can meet our prosperity goal - closing the productivity gap;</p> <p>- with 800,000 more in jobs and the work ethic being restored, our full employment goal - employment opportunity for all;</p> <p>- with 50,000 more students and standards rising, our education goal - 50 per cent of young people in higher education;</p> <p>- with 800,000 children already lifted out of poverty and our civic society renewing itself, we can meet our anti-poverty goal - to halve child poverty by 2010 and end it by 2020.</p> <p>First, I announce major reforms today to reward enterprise and entrepreneurship; open up competition in banking; promote new and growing businesses and e-commerce - and balanced growth across all the regions and nations of the United Kingdom.</p> <p>To remove more of the old barriers to new investment, I have decided on radical reforms of capital gains tax - beyond the tax cuts I set out in the Pre-Budget Report.</p> <p>When we came into Government capital gains tax was fixed at 40 per cent and we cut the long term rate of capital gains tax for business assets held for ten years or more.

      "bodyText": "A year ago the Government forecast the British economy would grow at 1-1.5 per cent. Today, I can report that in 1999, instead of the recession that many forecast, the British economy grew by 2 per cent. And Britain has been growing steadily while meeting our inflation target. Today inflation is 2.2 per cent. For the third year running inflation is in line with our target. And the target of 2.5 per cent - which I reaffirm - will be met this year, next year and the year after that. Because of the action we took in 1997 to stop inflation getting out of control, inflation in Britain has now been lower for longer than at any time since the 1960s. For almost thirty years, Britain's long term interest rates were, on average, 3 per cent higher than Germany's. Now British long term rates are down to the levels in Germany and today lower than in the USA. Amid the risks of an uncertain and often unstable global economy, we are determined to maintain our disciplined approach: determined not to make the old British mistakes of paying ourselves too much today at the cost of higher interest rates and fewer jobs tomorrow, determined not to make the old mistake of putting consumption before investment, the short term before the long term. Britain does not want a return to boom and bust. That is why the Bank of England has been right to take pre-emptive action on interest rates and to be vigilant on wage inflation. It is because the foundations on which we build are strong that the economy can meet our inflation target and achieve steady growth. Our forecast is that growth this year will rise to 2.75-3.25 per cent, and next year and the year after it is forecast to be 2.25 to 2.75 per cent - in line with our view of trend growth. Manufacturing is growing by 1.75 to 2.25 per cent this year and next. And business investment grew by 7.7 per cent last year to 14.5 per cent of national income, with Britain since 1998 for the first time investing more of our national income than our major European competitors, and more than America. This Budget is built on the realities of this new economy - that we will meet and master a new tide of unprecedented technological change by continuing to remove the old barriers to business investment and by continuing to expand employment opportunity for hard working families. I can report that unemployment today is at its lowest for 20 years, that there are 800,000 more people in work since 1997 and that there are one million vacancies on offer. Take-home pay is rising - by next year, for the typical family, a real terms rise in living standards of 10 per cent since 1997. Britain's economic success depends not only on monetary stability but on fiscal stability. Today, I can report that because of tough decisions to cut the deficit in our first two years and lower long term interest rates, debt interest payments will be four billion pounds a year lower. Because of the Welfare to Work reforms that have cut unemployment, social security spending on economic failure this year is a total of 3 billions less than the plans we inherited. Today, Mr Deputy Speaker, the state of the public finances is sound. In 1997 we inherited a current deficit exceeding 20 billion pounds. A year ago I estimated that this year's current surplus would be 2.5 billion pounds. I can report that we have not only balanced the current Budget but our current surplus this year is forecast to be 17 billion pounds. We have met and we will continue to meet, even on the most cautious of cases, our first rule of fiscal prudence, the golden rule. And we are also meeting our second rule, the sustainable investment rule. This year debt as a share of national income will fall well below the 44 per cent we inherited - to 37.1 per cent. Last year we forecast that the overall budget would be in deficit for this financial year - that public sector net borrowing would be 3 billion pounds. I can now report that due to the performance of the economy and to prudent management, the Budget is not in deficit by 3 billion but in surplus by 12 billion pounds. Mr Deputy Speaker, we inherited a deficit of 28 billion pounds in 1997. This year we will make a debt repayment of 12 billion pounds. Too often in the past, at the first sign of a cyclical surplus, governments have fallen back into imprudent ways. It is because we have learned from the mistakes of the last forty years that this Government will maintain its prudent and responsible approach. The figures I am announcing today show that we will meet our fiscal rules over the cycle. We will meet our fiscal rules even in the most cautious case, on the most cautious assumptions, including the most cautious view of trend growth at 2.25 per cent. And Mr Deputy Speaker, I can announce today that I have decided to lock in a greater fiscal tightening next year and the year after than we promised in last year's Budget and Pre-Budget Report. After the measures I announce today our projection is for a current surplus next year of 14 billion pounds and for the years after, surpluses of plus 16, plus 13, plus 8 and plus 8. Debt to GDP, which was 44 per cent in 1997, will fall to 35 next year, then 34, and then 33 in each of the next three years. Net borrowing will be minus 6.5 billions next year, that is, we will make a debt repayment next year of 6.5 billion pounds. Then net borrowing in 2001-2 will be minus 5, a debt repayment of 5 billion pounds, with net borrowing for the years after 2002-3 of plus 3, plus 11, plus 13, well within our fiscal rules. So from this stable platform of sound finances I am able to set out today our prudent and responsible approach for future years. Having met all of our fiscal rules, paid off 18 billions of debt this year and next, and locked in a greater fiscal tightening, we are able both to set a new envelope for public spending and investment for the years from 2001 and to cut taxes for hard working families. I can report that our fiscal rules enable us to increase current public spending by 2.5 per cent a year in real terms for the 3 years from 2001 and double net public investment as a share of national income from 0.9 per cent next year to 1.8 per cent in 2004. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have always said that our prudence is for a purpose. And in this Budget, because of our continuing prudence, we can now take the next steps towards that purpose - a Britain of opportunity and security not just for a few but for all: - with stability locked in, and enterprise growing, we can meet our prosperity goal - closing the productivity gap; - with 800,000 more in jobs and the work ethic being restored, our full employment goal - employment opportunity for all; - with 50,000 more students and standards rising, our education goal - 50 per cent of young people in higher education; - with 800,000 children already lifted out of poverty and our civic society renewing itself, we can meet our anti-poverty goal - to halve child poverty by 2010 and end it by 2020. First, I announce major reforms today to reward enterprise and entrepreneurship; open up competition in banking; promote new and growing businesses and e-commerce - and balanced growth across all the regions and nations of the United Kingdom. To remove more of the old barriers to new investment, I have decided on radical reforms of capital gains tax - beyond the tax cuts I set out in the Pre-Budget Report. When we came into Government capital gains tax was fixed at 40 per cent and we cut the long term rate of capital gains tax for business assets held for ten years or more. I have now decided to radically cut rates. I am announcing that from 6th April this year the new capital gains rates for business assets will be cut from 40 per cent to 35 per cent after one year, to 30 per cent after two years, to 20 per cent after three years, and down to 10 per cent after four years. I will make further tax cuts to remove the barriers that hold small and growing businesses back. Today business investors who own between 5 per cent and 25 per cent of a new and growing business do not benefit from the 10p rate. I will now cut their rate to 10 per cent for all investments above 5 per cent held for four or more years. I will make a further radical change - this time for Britain's unquoted companies. All investments held for four years will benefit from the 10 per cent rate. With both the lowest corporate tax rates for businesses ever and the lowest ever capital gains tax rates for long term investors, Britain is now the place for companies to start, to invest, to grow and to expand. I have a decision about one other tax on capital - inheritance tax. The threshold for inheritance tax is 231,000 pounds. I will next year raise it to 234,000 pounds. 96 per cent of people will be exempt from inheritance tax. I have one further cut in capital gains tax to be introduced from 6th April. So that millions more hard working people have a stake in the businesses whose wealth they create, we will remove the old barriers to a new share owning democracy. The all employee shareholding scheme which starts on 6th April has one defining requirement: that shareholding should be open to all employees. I can confirm that the 1.7 million people now in the 'Save As You Earn' scheme will continue to enjoy its benefits. I have also decided that high tech firms recruiting essential personnel will be able to offer share option incentives of 100,000 pounds for up to 15 employees. And the Financial Secretary will now consult on a technical solution to the tax treatment of share options in unapproved schemes. I can go further. In future all employee shareholders will secure all the benefits of the 10 per cent capital gains tax rate. Taken together, our measures are the biggest boost for employee shareholding our country has seen. The next step on our road to a wealth-owning democracy. Budget speech - part two",

      "body": "<p>Yesterday in response to the Cruickshank Report, my Rt Hon Friend the Secretary for Trade and I referred small business banking to the Competition Commission.</p> <p>Mr Cruickshank estimates that competition can reduce banking costs and charges by up to 10 per cent or 3 - 5 billion pounds a year.</p> <p>The money transmission system affects every cheque, every credit card and every debit transaction and reaches from every local cash dispenser to every corporate inter-bank transfer. Today I am announcing that we will legislate to ensure the UK payments system is open to new competition.</p> <p>The international competitiveness of the bond market in the City of London depends upon a level playing field. That is why today I am announcing the abolition from April 2001 of the withholding tax on the interest paid on international bonds. We will legislate so we can proceed on the basis of exchange of information nationally and internationally. This change should be widely welcomed in all parts of the house. There is no clearer indication of our determination to stand up for what is right for Britain.</p> <p>Since 1997 the number of small businesses in Britain has risen from 1.2 million to 1.3 million - a 100,000 increase.</p> <p>Today I continue to remove the old barriers to small business growth.</p> <p>Having already cut small business corporation tax from 23 per cent to 20 per cent and, for the first 10,000 pounds of their profits, to just 10 per cent, I am today making a further tax reduction. For all small and medium sized businesses the 40 per cent capital allowances - which I introduced in my 1997 Budget - will be made permanent.</p> <p>This will be of special help to manufacturing companies. Half manufacturing employment is in small and medium sized firms. So manufacturing will derive further benefit from the 150 million pounds I am allocating to our new research and development tax credit, introduced on 6th April, to finance 30 per cent of their R and D costs.</p> <p>I want to make Britain the best environment for e-commerce and catch up with America as swiftly as possible. To encourage one million small companies to go on line, I will introduce a special tax reduction. For the next three years any small business buying computers, or investing in e commerce and new information technology, will be able to immediately write off against tax the full 100 per cent of the cost in the year of purchase.</p> <p>Side by side with this incentive, the small business service will offer consultancy, advice and planning to help small businesses get on line and become e-companies, and with the additional resources the Secretary for Employment is providing the University for Industry, which starts this Autumn, will offer small business employees training on the Internet</p> <p>We are determined to lead in e-commerce and the Internet. Today we are introducing new rules for work permits in areas of highly skilled information technology where there is a global shortage.</p> <p>And to promote the use of the Internet we will legislate for other tax cuts - a 100 pounds tax cut for electronic filing of tax and VAT returns, and a further 50 pounds tax cut for electronic filing for those paying the working families tax credit.</p> <p>Tax cuts since 1997 are worth one billion pounds a year for small businesses alone.</p> <p>After today's measures, Britain now has the lowest small business corporation taxes we have ever had, the lowest in the industrialised world: since 1997, for small companies an average tax cut of almost 25 per cent.</p> <p>And to encourage the next generation of entrepreneurs, we are forming a partnership with the CBI, the Institute of Directors and the Chambers of Commerce to encourage enterprise in all communities. Two new enterprise funds will target business loans and management scholarships to high unemployment areas.</p> <p>Stage by stage we are moving from the Britain where enterprise was a closed circle for the few, to a Britain where enterprise will be open to all.</p> <p>We must also remove the old barriers of under-investment and neglect that for too long have held our regions back. Working with the new Regional Development Agencies and the Small Business Service, our aim is balanced economic development across all the regions and nations of the United Kingdom - a modern regional policy supporting local innovation, more investment and improved infrastructure.</p> <p>To finance a network of regional venture capital investment funds, we are today announcing a partnership with the European Investment Bank and the private sector - with a target of one billion pounds for new economic development for our regions and nations.</p> <p>The regional targets will be 85 million for the South West, 120 million for the North West, 130 million for the North East and Yorkshire, 250 million for the Midlands and East, 250 million for London and the South East. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will have their own funds.</p> <p>To further promote a modern regional policy, the Secretary for Industry will be announcing a regional innovation fund to facilitate the formation of local clusters in hi tech industries.</p> <p>For years Britain, as a whole, has lagged behind America in business access to venture capital investment. Here only half as much is invested per head.</p> <p>I am grateful to Mr Paul Myners, who has agreed to head a review of institutional investment, to report to me in time for the next Budget.</p> <p>Our goal for the whole of the United Kingdom is to remove the old barriers to full employment. We know that greater opportunity for all means greater prosperity for all. Since 1997 the number of unemployed on benefits has fallen by 30 per cent.</p> <p>Youth unemployment is down 70 per cent and nearly 200,000 more young people have now found jobs. Long term youth unemployment, which in the mid-eighties was at 500,000 and even in 1997 was as high as 200,000, is already down to 50,000.</p> <p>The New Deal demonstrates how false was the old choice between enterprise and fairness, between efficiency and equality. By delivering employment opportunity for all, we are making Britain both more enterprising and more fair, to the benefit not just of the high unemployment areas but the whole country.</p> <p>And because we have succeeded in this Parliament in removing the old barriers to employing the young, I can announce that starting from April next year we will extend the opportunities and the obligations of the New Deal to the long term adult unemployed - with four options of: work, work-based training, work experience including in the voluntary sector, self-employment. But no fifth option, no staying at home on benefit doing nothing.</p> <p>The relationship we are forging between rights and responsibilities is firmly rooted in both economic opportunity and individual responsibility.</p> <p>Instead of being left to draw benefit at a social security office, the unemployed who are able to work will sign up to seek work, with the long term unemployed offered the help of a personal employment adviser.</p> <p>To ease the transition back to work, the Government will introduce a new job grant for long term unemployed starting at 100 pounds and help with rent or mortgage.</p> <p>Instead of benefits paying more than work, work will now pay. And I can announce that we will extend the principle of the working families tax credit.</p> <p>As a first stage, from 1st April, all long term unemployed over 50 who want to return to work will be guaranteed a minimum income for their first year back - for wages up to 15,000 pounds a year, an extra payment of 60 pounds a week.</p> <p>And building on the forthcoming rise in the national minimum wage, I am today increasing the working families tax credit. It is already being paid to one million families in our country. And with today's family tax cut, the minimum family income will rise next April - from 200 pounds a week by 7 per cent to 214 pounds a week.</p> <p>Full employment is not just about the right to work, but, where there are jobs, the responsibility and the requirement to work.</p> <p>We will implement the Report of Lord Grabiner QC.</p> <p>Starting in May, a confidential phone line will advise claimants on how to move from the hidden economy and end fraudulent benefit or tax claims; how to get work, register as a business, or become self employed. After six months, from 1 January, for those who fail to respond, tougher rules and penalties will be imposed.</p> <p>From October, in the 20 highest unemployment areas of Britain covering 127,000 unemployed, local special action teams will be set up to help local unemployed people into nearby vacancies.</p> <p>The number of lone parents on income support has fallen by almost 100,000 since 1997. But the employment rate among lone parents in Britain is still only 45 per cent, far below the 70-80 per cent rates of America, France and Scandinavia.</p> <p>In this Budget we remove old barriers to work and I can today announce an extension of the New Deal in a new way to half a million lone parents.</p> <p>Piloted from this Autumn, and starting nationally from next April, lone parents with children over five will be invited to work-focussed interviews - and encouraged to take up new choices:</p> <p>- the choice to train for work with a new cash payment of 15 pounds a week on top of benefits;</p> <p>- the choice of a few hours work a week, with the first 20 pounds of earnings allowed with no reduction in benefit;</p> <p>- the choice of part time work with a guaranteed 155 pounds for 16 hours or the choice of full time work on a guaranteed 214 pounds a week;</p> <p>- and on every rung of this ladder of opportunity, help with back-to-work costs and with child care.</p> <p>Just as we remove old barriers to lone parents working when their children go to school, so too we will help mothers who want to be at home in the first months of their child's life.</p> <p>Today, too many children are born into poverty because the family income drops when the mother stops work. Yet this is the time when many mothers feel they need to be at home with their young child.</p> <p>The Secretary for Trade is announcing that he will review what improvements can be made in maternity pay and parental leave to improve family friendly employment.</p> <p>But today I can announce immediate decisions which recognise the extra costs families face when a child is born.</p> <p>For all low income mothers who meet the basic requirement of health check ups for their young child, we will increase the Sure-Start maternity grant from 200 to 300 pounds. Helping over 200,000 low income mothers. Mothers on paid maternity leave who would otherwise fall into income support will now stay on working families tax credit.</p> <p>Families receiving the credit where the mother wants to stay at home will no longer have to wait as long as six months for additional support after a child is born - this will be worth up to 30 pounds a week.</p> <p>I have examined the alternative put to me of a transferrable tax allowance for husbands and wives when mothers stay at home.</p> <p>Under this system, a family with two children on 15,000 pounds a year would receive 965 pounds a year. The working families tax credit is far better. With the improvements in it announced today the same couple will receive not 965 pounds a year but 2,200 pounds a year.</p> <p>The Prime Minister has set a national goal for our country - to abolish child poverty in 20 years, and to halve it by 2010.</p> <p>A Sure Start for all Britain's children is not only right but the best anti-crime, the best anti-drugs, the best anti-unemployment and the best anti-dependency policy for this country's future.</p> <p>And our strategy starts from the foundation of universal child benefit for all seven million families with children.</p> <p>When we came to office, child benefit was just 11 pounds five pence for the first child. Child benefit will be 15 pounds fifty pence from April 2001, 40 per cent more than in 1997.</p> <p>For young children in the poorest families, weekly support in 1997 was just 28 pounds. We have raised it in every Budget and today the Secretary for Social Security is announcing a further increase for the poorest children of four pounds 35 pence a week.</p> <p>So maximum support is up from the 28 pounds of 1997 to up to 50 pounds a week next year.</p> <p>As a result of all our measures, the poorest two child family on income support will now be 1,500 pounds a year better off than in 1997.</p> <p>And the low paid family with two children on a wage of 10,000 pounds a year will now be 2,700 pounds a year better off.</p> <p>This is what we mean by tackling child poverty while making work pay.</p> <p>I can now report that the numbers of children lifted out of poverty will this year rise beyond one million, and next year reach 1.2 million children - the greatest reduction in child poverty in 50 years, our country now at last fulfilling this generation's obligations to the next.</p> <p>And as we move forward to take the second million children out of poverty, I can confirm today that the Secretary for Social Security and I have agreed on the next major reform.</p> <p>Over the next three years, building on the foundation of universal child benefit, we will create an integrated and seamless system of support for children paid to the mother.</p> <p>The war against child poverty needs more than finance and more than the efforts of government acting alone. The war against child poverty can only be won by the combined efforts of private, voluntary, charitable and public sectors working together.</p> <p>I can confirm that after consultation with charities and voluntary organisations we will proceed to set up, in every region of our country, and with new cash allocated in our spending review, not just one children's fund but a network of local and regional children's funds to support work by the voluntary sector in meeting the needs of children.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,149329,00.html\">Budget speech - part three</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,149326,00.html\">Budget speech - part one</a></p>",

Since 1997 the number of small businesses in Britain has risen from 1.2 million to 1.3 million - a 100,000 increase. Today I continue to remove the old barriers to small business growth. Having already cut small business corporation tax from 23 per cent to 20 per cent and, for the first 10,000 pounds of their profits, to just 10 per cent, I am today making a further tax reduction. For all small and medium sized businesses the 40 per cent capital allowances - which I introduced in my 1997 Budget - will be made permanent. This will be of special help to manufacturing companies. Half manufacturing employment is in small and medium sized firms. So manufacturing will derive further benefit from the 150 million pounds I am allocating to our new research and development tax credit, introduced on 6th April, to finance 30 per cent of their R and D costs. I want to make Britain the best environment for e-commerce and catch up with America as swiftly as possible. To encourage one million small companies to go on line, I will introduce a special tax reduction. For the next three years any small business buying computers, or investing in e commerce and new information technology, will be able to immediately write off against tax the full 100 per cent of the cost in the year of purchase. Side by side with this incentive, the small business service will offer consultancy, advice and planning to help small businesses get on line and become e-companies, and with the additional resources the Secretary for Employment is providing the University for Industry, which starts this Autumn, will offer small business employees training on the Internet We are determined to lead in e-commerce and the Internet. Today we are introducing new rules for work permits in areas of highly skilled information technology where there is a global shortage. And to promote the use of the Internet we will legislate for other tax cuts - a 100 pounds tax cut for electronic filing of tax and VAT returns, and a further 50 pounds tax cut for electronic filing for those paying the working families tax credit. Tax cuts since 1997 are worth one billion pounds a year for small businesses alone. After today's measures, Britain now has the lowest small business corporation taxes we have ever had, the lowest in the industrialised world: since 1997, for small companies an average tax cut of almost 25 per cent. And to encourage the next generation of entrepreneurs, we are forming a partnership with the CBI, the Institute of Directors and the Chambers of Commerce to encourage enterprise in all communities. Two new enterprise funds will target business loans and management scholarships to high unemployment areas. Stage by stage we are moving from the Britain where enterprise was a closed circle for the few, to a Britain where enterprise will be open to all. We must also remove the old barriers of under-investment and neglect that for too long have held our regions back. Working with the new Regional Development Agencies and the Small Business Service, our aim is balanced economic development across all the regions and nations of the United Kingdom - a modern regional policy supporting local innovation, more investment and improved infrastructure. To finance a network of regional venture capital investment funds, we are today announcing a partnership with the European Investment Bank and the private sector - with a target of one billion pounds for new economic development for our regions and nations. The regional targets will be 85 million for the South West, 120 million for the North West, 130 million for the North East and Yorkshire, 250 million for the Midlands and East, 250 million for London and the South East. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will have their own funds. To further promote a modern regional policy, the Secretary for Industry will be announcing a regional innovation fund to facilitate the formation of local clusters in hi tech industries. For years Britain, as a whole, has lagged behind America in business access to venture capital investment. Here only half as much is invested per head. I am grateful to Mr Paul Myners, who has agreed to head a review of institutional investment, to report to me in time for the next Budget. Our goal for the whole of the United Kingdom is to remove the old barriers to full employment. We know that greater opportunity for all means greater prosperity for all. Since 1997 the number of unemployed on benefits has fallen by 30 per cent. Youth unemployment is down 70 per cent and nearly 200,000 more young people have now found jobs. Long term youth unemployment, which in the mid-eighties was at 500,000 and even in 1997 was as high as 200,000, is already down to 50,000. The New Deal demonstrates how false was the old choice between enterprise and fairness, between efficiency and equality. By delivering employment opportunity for all, we are making Britain both more enterprising and more fair, to the benefit not just of the high unemployment areas but the whole country. And because we have succeeded in this Parliament in removing the old barriers to employing the young, I can announce that starting from April next year we will extend the opportunities and the obligations of the New Deal to the long term adult unemployed - with four options of: work, work-based training, work experience including in the voluntary sector, self-employment. But no fifth option, no staying at home on benefit doing nothing. The relationship we are forging between rights and responsibilities is firmly rooted in both economic opportunity and individual responsibility. Instead of being left to draw benefit at a social security office, the unemployed who are able to work will sign up to seek work, with the long term unemployed offered the help of a personal employment adviser. To ease the transition back to work, the Government will introduce a new job grant for long term unemployed starting at 100 pounds and help with rent or mortgage. Instead of benefits paying more than work, work will now pay. And I can announce that we will extend the principle of the working families tax credit. As a first stage, from 1st April, all long term unemployed over 50 who want to return to work will be guaranteed a minimum income for their first year back - for wages up to 15,000 pounds a year, an extra payment of 60 pounds a week. And building on the forthcoming rise in the national minimum wage, I am today increasing the working families tax credit. It is already being paid to one million families in our country. And with today's family tax cut, the minimum family income will rise next April - from 200 pounds a week by 7 per cent to 214 pounds a week. Full employment is not just about the right to work, but, where there are jobs, the responsibility and the requirement to work. We will implement the Report of Lord Grabiner QC. Starting in May, a confidential phone line will advise claimants on how to move from the hidden economy and end fraudulent benefit or tax claims; how to get work, register as a business, or become self employed. After six months, from 1 January, for those who fail to respond, tougher rules and penalties will be imposed. From October, in the 20 highest unemployment areas of Britain covering 127,000 unemployed, local special action teams will be set up to help local unemployed people into nearby vacancies. The number of lone parents on income support has fallen by almost 100,000 since 1997. But the employment rate among lone parents in Britain is still only 45 per cent, far below the 70-80 per cent rates of America, France and Scandinavia. In this Budget we remove old barriers to work and I can today announce an extension of the New Deal in a new way to half a million lone parents. Piloted from this Autumn, and starting nationally from next April, lone parents with children over five will be invited to work-focussed interviews - and encouraged to take up new choices: - the choice to train for work with a new cash payment of 15 pounds a week on top of benefits; - the choice of a few hours work a week, with the first 20 pounds of earnings allowed with no reduction in benefit; - the choice of part time work with a guaranteed 155 pounds for 16 hours or the choice of full time work on a guaranteed 214 pounds a week; - and on every rung of this ladder of opportunity, help with back-to-work costs and with child care. Just as we remove old barriers to lone parents working when their children go to school, so too we will help mothers who want to be at home in the first months of their child's life. Today, too many children are born into poverty because the family income drops when the mother stops work. Yet this is the time when many mothers feel they need to be at home with their young child. The Secretary for Trade is announcing that he will review what improvements can be made in maternity pay and parental leave to improve family friendly employment. But today I can announce immediate decisions which recognise the extra costs families face when a child is born. For all low income mothers who meet the basic requirement of health check ups for their young child, we will increase the Sure-Start maternity grant from 200 to 300 pounds. Helping over 200,000 low income mothers. Mothers on paid maternity leave who would otherwise fall into income support will now stay on working families tax credit. Families receiving the credit where the mother wants to stay at home will no longer have to wait as long as six months for additional support after a child is born - this will be worth up to 30 pounds a week. I have examined the alternative put to me of a transferrable tax allowance for husbands and wives when mothers stay at home. Under this system, a family with two children on 15,000 pounds a year would receive 965 pounds a year. The working families tax credit is far better. With the improvements in it announced today the same couple will receive not 965 pounds a year but 2,200 pounds a year. The Prime Minister has set a national goal for our country - to abolish child poverty in 20 years, and to halve it by 2010. A Sure Start for all Britain's children is not only right but the best anti-crime, the best anti-drugs, the best anti-unemployment and the best anti-dependency policy for this country's future. And our strategy starts from the foundation of universal child benefit for all seven million families with children. When we came to office, child benefit was just 11 pounds five pence for the first child. Child benefit will be 15 pounds fifty pence from April 2001, 40 per cent more than in 1997. For young children in the poorest families, weekly support in 1997 was just 28 pounds. We have raised it in every Budget and today the Secretary for Social Security is announcing a further increase for the poorest children of four pounds 35 pence a week. So maximum support is up from the 28 pounds of 1997 to up to 50 pounds a week next year. As a result of all our measures, the poorest two child family on income support will now be 1,500 pounds a year better off than in 1997. And the low paid family with two children on a wage of 10,000 pounds a year will now be 2,700 pounds a year better off. This is what we mean by tackling child poverty while making work pay. I can now report that the numbers of children lifted out of poverty will this year rise beyond one million, and next year reach 1.2 million children - the greatest reduction in child poverty in 50 years, our country now at last fulfilling this generation's obligations to the next. And as we move forward to take the second million children out of poverty, I can confirm today that the Secretary for Social Security and I have agreed on the next major reform. Over the next three years, building on the foundation of universal child benefit, we will create an integrated and seamless system of support for children paid to the mother. The war against child poverty needs more than finance and more than the efforts of government acting alone. The war against child poverty can only be won by the combined efforts of private, voluntary, charitable and public sectors working together. I can confirm that after consultation with charities and voluntary organisations we will proceed to set up, in every region of our country, and with new cash allocated in our spending review, not just one children's fund but a network of local and regional children's funds to support work by the voluntary sector in meeting the needs of children.

      "body": "<p>A strong civic society is built not by rights alone but by rights and responsibilities and by the shared pursuit of the common good - which every year enlists the energies and realises the idealism of more than 22 million British citizens.</p> <p>It is time for Government to do more to encourage and extend this civic patriotism.</p> <p>All voluntary organisations and charities will benefit from the tax reforms I am announcing to make it easier to give money and time. From 6th April this year for every pound any taxpayer gives to charity, the Government will add an extra 28 pence. And to encourage payroll giving, for every pound contributed through the pay packet, the Government will add up to 50 pence worth of tax relief.</p> <p>Tax relief will be available not just for cash donations, but for gifts of shares.</p> <p>To encourage corporate giving, any company can, from 1st April, receive tax relief on the full amount of any donation.</p> <p>Within prescribed limits, I will go further in exempting ticket sales for charitable fund raising events from VAT, so that the contributions people make will go straight to the charities they support.</p> <p>Each of these measures will also help those charities and non-governmental organisations who, with the churches, have, for decades, led the crusade to combat Third World poverty and secure debt relief.</p> <p>With these reforms, this Government matches their commitment because it shares their cause - a virtuous circle of debt reduction, poverty relief and economic development for the poorest countries.</p> <p>A strong civic society takes seriously its obligations to our elderly:</p> <p>- to the very poor pensioners whom we must help out of poverty;</p> <p>- to those just above benefit levels whose lifetime savings should not, as in the past, be a barrier to securing a better retirement income;</p> <p>- to those who, while better off, are on fixed incomes.</p> <p>The Secretary for Social Security is to launch a consultation on how, for the next Parliament, we can develop a new pensioners credit - designed not only to lift the poorest out of poverty, but also to do more for those with modest occupational pensions and savings who should not be penalised for having worked hard all their lives and saved for their retirement.</p> <p>Under the framework on which we will consult, an older pensioner with income, for example, of less than 100 pounds a week, or a couple with less than 150 pounds a week, would qualify for a pension credit to raise their income.</p> <p>As we consult on this reform, we are making immediate changes.</p> <p>The pensioners tax allowance will be set this year at 5,790 pounds and for those over 75 at 6,050 pounds. Nearly 6 million pensioners will not pay any income tax at all.</p> <p>And with the new 10p rate on savings, 1.5 million pensioners will, for the first time, pay tax at half the rate of the past, at 10p not 20p.</p> <p>And I have decided to do more today for elderly citizens with modest savings whose very thrift has perversely and unfairly debarred them from receiving the income they need.</p> <p>For years any pensioner with savings over 3,000 pounds has lost out on income support. The last Government froze the limit at 3,000 pounds in 1988. I have decided from next April to double the limit - raising it from 3,000 pounds to 6,000 pounds.</p> <p>The cut off point for income support was frozen at 8,000 pounds of savings in 1990. We will raise that to 12,000 pounds.</p> <p>As a result, 500,000 elderly people - previously penalised for their thrift and savings - will be on average 250 pounds a year better off, many better off by 1,000 pounds a year.</p> <p>Fuel poverty scarred our country for too long. That is why in our first Budget we cut VAT on fuel; why in our second the winter allowance was introduced at 20 pounds and then in our third Budget raised to 100 pounds, available to all 8.5 million households with a resident over 60. Under this Government the winter allowance will be paid this year and paid every year.</p> <p>I have considered whether to raise the allowance in line with inflation, which would put it up to 103 pounds, or in line with earnings, which would raise it to 104 pounds fifty.</p> <p>But I have decided in this Budget not to raise it by 4 or even 5 pounds but to raise it by 50 pounds to 150 pounds. This winter allowance, at 150 pounds, will now cover up to four winter months of a hard pressed pensioner's fuel bill.</p> <p>I can further announce that 600,000 of our elderly will benefit from the new 'affordable warmth' programme to install fuel efficient central heating in one million homes throughout Britain.</p> <p>Beginning on 1st November all pensioners over 75 will receive the free TV licence, worth 104 pounds. And I can announce today that any pensioner over 75 who has an unexpired licence which runs beyond 1st November will also be eligible for a refund for every unexpired month.</p> <p>Of all the measures to lift our poorest pensioners out of poverty, the minimum income guarantee is the most essential. We will raise the minimum income guarantee in line with earnings next year.</p> <p>For a single pensioner it will be worth 82 pounds a week, and for pensioners over the age of 80 it will be 90 pounds a week. For a couple it will be 127 pounds a week and for over-80s, 137 pounds a week. Taking these measures together - the winter allowance, the TV licence and the higher minimum guarantee - by</p> <p>April next year 1 million pensioners will be, compared with 1997, 20 pounds a week, or 1,000 pounds a year, better off.</p> <p>As we look to the future, I want all to be able to achieve the security of a wealth-owning democracy, with prosperity reaching the people and places the economy has too long forgotten.</p> <p>So we want to do more to help people start a bank account and start saving, more to help people invest in their pension, more to help people get on to the first rung of the savings ladder and make provision for their future.</p> <p>Today in Britain up to 3.5 million adults have no bank account. The Cruickshank Report has revealed that a basic affordable bank account for everyone would be profitable for the banks and that using banking facilities - and not the cash economy - just to pay gas and electricity bills could save families 50 pounds a year, or one pound a week.</p> <p>I am now inviting the banks to work with the Post Office to offer this basic banking service to all. And I want working families to be able to move seamlessly from starting an account to starting to save. I have already announced measures to reward pensioner savings.</p> <p>This year 6.5 million individual savings accounts have already been started. For the coming year, the ceiling was announced at 5,000 pounds of savings. Instead, for one more year I will keep the ceiling at 7,000 pounds.</p> <p>I said last November that I would, in future, make an annual Budget decision on real term rises in road fuel duties - the money to go to a new ring-fenced fund for roads and public transport. Since the Pre-Budget Report world oil prices have risen rapidly from 23 dollars to 30 dollars a barrel. So, in this Budget I have decided that, beyond the automatic inflation rise of two pence a litre, there will be no real terms increase in road fuel duties.</p> <p>And to encourage the use of ultra-low sulphur petrol, I will set fuel duty at 1p per litre below other petrol from 1st October. An extension to the new lower rate vehicle excise duty comes in on 1st March next year. Until that date I have decided - for all cars - to freeze vehicle excise duty. At present the lower rate - at 55 pounds below the standard rate - is available for 1.5 million cars.</p> <p>From next year I will extend the reduced rate of vehicle excise duty to cars at 1200 ccs or below. This will cut vehicle excise duty to 105 pounds for 2.2 million additional cars, the reduced rate will now cover almost 4 million cars.</p> <p>I am also introducing from 1st March next year, for newly purchased cars, a four band vehicle excise duty rewarding the most environmentally friendly vehicles.</p> <p>Under the rates I am publishing today, 95 per cent of new cars will pay less than they would under the current system, half of them at least 30 pounds less.</p> <p>We will also cut the vehicle excise duty for forty thousand 38 tonne and 41 tonne lorries by 500 pounds; the 40 tonne class lorries will have their rate cut by 1,800 pounds; for all other heavy lorries rates will be frozen.</p> <p>The environmental impact of these tax cuts - taken together with the revenue neutral proposals for company cars - will be a reduction in carbon emissions of one million tonnes by 2010. This is on top of the 5 million tonnes reduction in carbon emissions by 2010 as a result of the climate change levy which is also revenue neutral and on which the Financial Secretary is publishing further details today.</p> <p>To further cut pollution we will legislate the aggregates levy, which will again be made revenue neutral through a further 0.1 per cent cut in employers' national insurance.</p> <p>These two measures will together cut employers' national insurance contributions by 1.35 billion pounds.</p> <p>There is also a strong environmental case for reducing stamp duty for development of brown-field sites, as recommended by the Rogers Report. The Paymaster General will now consult in detail on the measure.</p> <p>For the property market, in addition to the previously announced withdrawal of mortgage interest tax relief, stamp duty on property sales will be raised for sales above 250,000 to 3 per cent and for sales above 500,000 to 4 per cent. But for properties below 250,000 I propose no change. And I also propose to freeze insurance tax.</p> <p>Last year I froze duties on all spirits.</p> <p>This year an inflation rise would push the price of whisky up by 22 pence a bottle. Because of the competitive position of the industry I will this year continue to freeze duty on all spirits. Beer will rise only by inflation - by 1 pence a pint- and wine only by inflation, by 4 pence a bottle.</p> <p>Now that the return-leg exemption for air fares has been found in breach of Single Market law, I am taking the opportunity to introduce a new, fairer and lower air passenger duty - at an overall cost to the Exchequer of 80 million pounds a year. The tax on economy flights within the UK will be the same or lower. For economy flights outside Europe the rate will remain at 20 pounds and there will be a new business class rate of 40 pounds.</p> <p>30 million economy passengers travelling to Europe will have air passenger duty cut in half - from 10 pounds to 5 pounds. And on flights from the Scottish Highlands and islands I will abolish air passenger duty altogether.</p> <p>On tobacco, the Paymaster General will tomorrow announce tough new measures to tackle smuggling. Cigarette taxes will rise by 5 per cent above inflation from tonight - by 25 pence a packet - with every penny of the extra revenue going - as I promised - to funding our hospitals and the National Health Service.</p> <p>And I am also commissioning a long term assessment of technological, demographic and medical trends over the next two decades that will affect the Health Service, to report to the Treasury in time for the start of the next spending review in 2002.</p> <p>I have a number of other fiscal decisions to make.</p> <p>Debt interest payments are down by 4 billion pounds a year. And because we have not spent and we will not spend more at the expense of being prudent, we have also made the tough decisions to tackle benefit fraud, to move people from welfare to work, and to control the social security budget.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,149330,00.html\">Budget speech - part four</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,149327,00.html\">Budget speech - part two</a></p>",

It is time for Government to do more to encourage and extend this civic patriotism. All voluntary organisations and charities will benefit from the tax reforms I am announcing to make it easier to give money and time. From 6th April this year for every pound any taxpayer gives to charity, the Government will add an extra 28 pence. And to encourage payroll giving, for every pound contributed through the pay packet, the Government will add up to 50 pence worth of tax relief. Tax relief will be available not just for cash donations, but for gifts of shares. To encourage corporate giving, any company can, from 1st April, receive tax relief on the full amount of any donation. Within prescribed limits, I will go further in exempting ticket sales for charitable fund raising events from VAT, so that the contributions people make will go straight to the charities they support. Each of these measures will also help those charities and non-governmental organisations who, with the churches, have, for decades, led the crusade to combat Third World poverty and secure debt relief. With these reforms, this Government matches their commitment because it shares their cause - a virtuous circle of debt reduction, poverty relief and economic development for the poorest countries. A strong civic society takes seriously its obligations to our elderly: - to the very poor pensioners whom we must help out of poverty; - to those just above benefit levels whose lifetime savings should not, as in the past, be a barrier to securing a better retirement income; - to those who, while better off, are on fixed incomes. The Secretary for Social Security is to launch a consultation on how, for the next Parliament, we can develop a new pensioners credit - designed not only to lift the poorest out of poverty, but also to do more for those with modest occupational pensions and savings who should not be penalised for having worked hard all their lives and saved for their retirement. Under the framework on which we will consult, an older pensioner with income, for example, of less than 100 pounds a week, or a couple with less than 150 pounds a week, would qualify for a pension credit to raise their income. As we consult on this reform, we are making immediate changes. The pensioners tax allowance will be set this year at 5,790 pounds and for those over 75 at 6,050 pounds. Nearly 6 million pensioners will not pay any income tax at all. And with the new 10p rate on savings, 1.5 million pensioners will, for the first time, pay tax at half the rate of the past, at 10p not 20p. And I have decided to do more today for elderly citizens with modest savings whose very thrift has perversely and unfairly debarred them from receiving the income they need. For years any pensioner with savings over 3,000 pounds has lost out on income support. The last Government froze the limit at 3,000 pounds in 1988. I have decided from next April to double the limit - raising it from 3,000 pounds to 6,000 pounds. The cut off point for income support was frozen at 8,000 pounds of savings in 1990. We will raise that to 12,000 pounds. As a result, 500,000 elderly people - previously penalised for their thrift and savings - will be on average 250 pounds a year better off, many better off by 1,000 pounds a year. Fuel poverty scarred our country for too long. That is why in our first Budget we cut VAT on fuel; why in our second the winter allowance was introduced at 20 pounds and then in our third Budget raised to 100 pounds, available to all 8.5 million households with a resident over 60. Under this Government the winter allowance will be paid this year and paid every year. I have considered whether to raise the allowance in line with inflation, which would put it up to 103 pounds, or in line with earnings, which would raise it to 104 pounds fifty. But I have decided in this Budget not to raise it by 4 or even 5 pounds but to raise it by 50 pounds to 150 pounds. This winter allowance, at 150 pounds, will now cover up to four winter months of a hard pressed pensioner's fuel bill. I can further announce that 600,000 of our elderly will benefit from the new 'affordable warmth' programme to install fuel efficient central heating in one million homes throughout Britain. Beginning on 1st November all pensioners over 75 will receive the free TV licence, worth 104 pounds. And I can announce today that any pensioner over 75 who has an unexpired licence which runs beyond 1st November will also be eligible for a refund for every unexpired month. Of all the measures to lift our poorest pensioners out of poverty, the minimum income guarantee is the most essential. We will raise the minimum income guarantee in line with earnings next year. For a single pensioner it will be worth 82 pounds a week, and for pensioners over the age of 80 it will be 90 pounds a week. For a couple it will be 127 pounds a week and for over-80s, 137 pounds a week. Taking these measures together - the winter allowance, the TV licence and the higher minimum guarantee - by April next year 1 million pensioners will be, compared with 1997, 20 pounds a week, or 1,000 pounds a year, better off. As we look to the future, I want all to be able to achieve the security of a wealth-owning democracy, with prosperity reaching the people and places the economy has too long forgotten. So we want to do more to help people start a bank account and start saving, more to help people invest in their pension, more to help people get on to the first rung of the savings ladder and make provision for their future. Today in Britain up to 3.5 million adults have no bank account. The Cruickshank Report has revealed that a basic affordable bank account for everyone would be profitable for the banks and that using banking facilities - and not the cash economy - just to pay gas and electricity bills could save families 50 pounds a year, or one pound a week. I am now inviting the banks to work with the Post Office to offer this basic banking service to all. And I want working families to be able to move seamlessly from starting an account to starting to save. I have already announced measures to reward pensioner savings. This year 6.5 million individual savings accounts have already been started. For the coming year, the ceiling was announced at 5,000 pounds of savings. Instead, for one more year I will keep the ceiling at 7,000 pounds. I said last November that I would, in future, make an annual Budget decision on real term rises in road fuel duties - the money to go to a new ring-fenced fund for roads and public transport. Since the Pre-Budget Report world oil prices have risen rapidly from 23 dollars to 30 dollars a barrel. So, in this Budget I have decided that, beyond the automatic inflation rise of two pence a litre, there will be no real terms increase in road fuel duties. And to encourage the use of ultra-low sulphur petrol, I will set fuel duty at 1p per litre below other petrol from 1st October. An extension to the new lower rate vehicle excise duty comes in on 1st March next year. Until that date I have decided - for all cars - to freeze vehicle excise duty. At present the lower rate - at 55 pounds below the standard rate - is available for 1.5 million cars. From next year I will extend the reduced rate of vehicle excise duty to cars at 1200 ccs or below. This will cut vehicle excise duty to 105 pounds for 2.2 million additional cars, the reduced rate will now cover almost 4 million cars. I am also introducing from 1st March next year, for newly purchased cars, a four band vehicle excise duty rewarding the most environmentally friendly vehicles. Under the rates I am publishing today, 95 per cent of new cars will pay less than they would under the current system, half of them at least 30 pounds less. We will also cut the vehicle excise duty for forty thousand 38 tonne and 41 tonne lorries by 500 pounds; the 40 tonne class lorries will have their rate cut by 1,800 pounds; for all other heavy lorries rates will be frozen. The environmental impact of these tax cuts - taken together with the revenue neutral proposals for company cars - will be a reduction in carbon emissions of one million tonnes by 2010. This is on top of the 5 million tonnes reduction in carbon emissions by 2010 as a result of the climate change levy which is also revenue neutral and on which the Financial Secretary is publishing further details today. To further cut pollution we will legislate the aggregates levy, which will again be made revenue neutral through a further 0.1 per cent cut in employers' national insurance. These two measures will together cut employers' national insurance contributions by 1.35 billion pounds. There is also a strong environmental case for reducing stamp duty for development of brown-field sites, as recommended by the Rogers Report. The Paymaster General will now consult in detail on the measure. For the property market, in addition to the previously announced withdrawal of mortgage interest tax relief, stamp duty on property sales will be raised for sales above 250,000 to 3 per cent and for sales above 500,000 to 4 per cent. But for properties below 250,000 I propose no change. And I also propose to freeze insurance tax. Last year I froze duties on all spirits. This year an inflation rise would push the price of whisky up by 22 pence a bottle. Because of the competitive position of the industry I will this year continue to freeze duty on all spirits. Beer will rise only by inflation - by 1 pence a pint- and wine only by inflation, by 4 pence a bottle. Now that the return-leg exemption for air fares has been found in breach of Single Market law, I am taking the opportunity to introduce a new, fairer and lower air passenger duty - at an overall cost to the Exchequer of 80 million pounds a year. The tax on economy flights within the UK will be the same or lower. For economy flights outside Europe the rate will remain at 20 pounds and there will be a new business class rate of 40 pounds. 30 million economy passengers travelling to Europe will have air passenger duty cut in half - from 10 pounds to 5 pounds. And on flights from the Scottish Highlands and islands I will abolish air passenger duty altogether. On tobacco, the Paymaster General will tomorrow announce tough new measures to tackle smuggling. Cigarette taxes will rise by 5 per cent above inflation from tonight - by 25 pence a packet - with every penny of the extra revenue going - as I promised - to funding our hospitals and the National Health Service. And I am also commissioning a long term assessment of technological, demographic and medical trends over the next two decades that will affect the Health Service, to report to the Treasury in time for the start of the next spending review in 2002. I have a number of other fiscal decisions to make. Debt interest payments are down by 4 billion pounds a year. And because we have not spent and we will not spend more at the expense of being prudent, we have also made the tough decisions to tackle benefit fraud, to move people from welfare to work, and to control the social security budget.

I will proceed from 6th April with our one pence cut in the basic rate of income tax from 23 per cent to 22 per cent, the lowest basic tax rate for 70 years.</p> <p>I am also combining the cut in income tax with a further tax cut - this time for families. Next April for 5 million families with children, the new children's tax credit will be increased from 416 pounds to 442 pounds a year. For these families this credit will now be worth twice as much as the old Married Couples Allowance it replaces.

      "bodyText": "Compared to last year's Budget forecast, social security spending is lower this year by 2 billion pounds and will be another 2 billions lower next year, a saving of 4 billions in all. Because we have cut borrowing and reformed the welfare state, cutting the costs of social and economic failure, and because we have been financially disciplined, extra resources are now available for our priorities. And, Mr Deputy Speaker, a Budget is about priorities. In my Pre-Budget consultations I have read carefully detailed Budget representations and examined proposals from all sides of the House. I have examined proposals for transferrable tax allowances at 4.25 billion, private health insurance tax reliefs at half a billion and for abolishing capital gains tax at 3.9 billion and top rate tax cuts at 690 million for every 1p.

I have decided instead on a prudent and responsible approach that allows us to repay debt and lock in an even greater fiscal tightening, and that allows us even after meeting our fiscal rules, to target tax cuts on hard working families and to release for our public services in the coming year alone additional resources of four billion pounds. These extra resources are not at the expense of our prudence, they arise because of our prudence. I can announce an immediate new investment of 280 million pounds in transport, 250 million of it to a ring fenced fund for improving roads and public transport including transport in rural areas. The Deputy Prime Minister will be making a statement on individual allocations for the coming year later this week. I am able to announce an additional 285 million pounds to be spent from April for fighting crime. Later this week the Home Secretary will announce further details. And I am also announcing additional investment in UK education starting on 1st April of 1 billion pounds. Under the Secretary for Education and Employment's leadership, class sizes for 5 -7 year olds in primary schools are being cut and significant improvements in reading, writing, and maths achieved. Last year he made a payment to every primary school for books of 2,000 pounds. Now this year more cash will go directly into the classroom.

The Secretary of State is proposing to back up reforms in our secondary schools with new measures to boost the performance of those falling behind and to raise the performance of all pupils by the age of 14. To support these reforms in our secondary schools he will now make a payment to every head teacher for books, equipment and staffing. Last year he was able to make an extra payment for books and equipment of 2,000 pounds. This April every one of these 3,500 secondary schools will receive a minimum payment of 30,000 pounds and the largest schools will receive 50,000 pounds. A total of 300 million in new investment through these measures alone, money paid direct to the school and to the head teacher for use in the classroom. And to advance our goal of 50 per cent of young people in higher education, the Secretary for Education will also announce that three times as many 16 year olds will, from this Autumn, benefit from education maintenance allowances - worth up to 30 pounds a week and that next month he will launch a national campaign to raise staying on rates.

As I said a Budget is about priorities. A choice has been posed between investing in a National Health Service financed by public expenditure with access based on need, and privatised health care dependent on private insurance. This Government is committed to a publicly funded National Health Service true to the original principles of its founders. Securing the long term future of the NHS is one of the great challenges this country must and will meet. Tomorrow the Prime Minister will make a statement to this House on the work he and the Health Secretary will lead over the next 4 months to reform and modernise the Health Service. The Government's plan, to be published in July alongside the detailed public spending allocations, will address long standing variations in efficiency performance and health outcomes, and the right balance between preventative, primary and hospital care. And now that the overall public spending total is set for the years until 2004, I have decided that I can back long term reform with long term resources for the Health Service by today announcing the NHS allocation not just for one year but for the next four years. Since its creation, National Health Service spending has risen by an average 3.3 per cent a year above inflation. Under the last Government it rose by 2.9 per cent. We have decided that in the years from now until 2004 the NHS will grow by twice as much - by 6.1 per cent a year over and above inflation, by far the largest sustained increase in NHS funding of any period in the 50 year history of the Health Service. Last year the equivalent of just over 1,850 pounds per household was spent on the NHS. By 2004 more than 2800 pounds per household will be spent on the NHS.

With today's extra resources, and the reforms still to come, we can plan to recruit and train up to 10,000 more nurses. Let me emphasise that more resources must mean more reform and modernisation . The Prime Minister, in his statement to the House tomorrow, will set out how with the guarantee of sustained investment, the Government, the professions and the NHS can together rise to the challenge of delivering better health care for all. I can make one further announcement. In 10 days time at the beginning of the new financial year the NHS was scheduled to have a 2.9 billions addition on last year. I have decided to raise that figure with immediate effect by allocating not only the 300 million in tobacco revenues I promised last Autumn, but by adding to that to achieve in total an extra 2 billion pounds - making a rise next year of 4.9 billion pounds - extra money the NHS can start using from 1st April. So health spending will rise from last year's 45.1 billion, and this year's 49.3 billion to next year: 54.2 billions; the year after 58.6 billion; then 63.5 billion; and then from April 2003, 68.7 billion pounds - over these five years a cash increase of over 50 per cent, a real terms increase of 35 per cent. New money we can provide because we have made our choice: a Budget that unites the whole country, a Budget for all the people. We have been prudent for a purpose: a stronger fairer Britain. And I commend this Budget to the House. Budget speech - part three Budget speech - part two Budget speech - part one",

      "bodyText": "Here at St Thomas More we believe in using what we've got - not only the technology but also our pupils' ability to think. It's important that children are intellectually challenged, so we use ICT to access specialised websites. But we also explore what we can do in the computer programs we already use. For example, we use Microsoft Word for teaching the children the mathematical concept of the transformation of shapes - an idea given us by a pupil! So why buy a specialised program to do this? We are currently setting up mathematics and science \"challenge\" areas and are already doing work which some people would regard as quite advanced. For example, pupils from years five and six have been working on the problem of how to market the Millennium Dome, and on modelling using ICT. ICT will help you extend the children's thinking abilities if you have very focused questions. It's no good being vague, and setting loose tasks.",

Results of poll ICM interviewed a random sample of 505 parents of primary and secondary schoolchildren, 501 primary and secondary school teachers and 101 university lecturers drawn from nationally representative samples. Interviews were conducted by telephone on February 8-15 2000. Focus groups were conducted at Sunbury-on-Thames and Sutton Coldfield on February 15-16 2000.

      "body": "<p>The idea of the 2001 Banbury Calendar may not inspire as much excitement as the Sports Illustrated version, but it's sparked a stream of excited emails across England. As the winners of the BT FutureTalk School Awards, Frank Wise School, Banbury School, Brockworth Comprehensive and Abbey Wood's School have been awarded \u00a325,000 to create a local calendar in their classrooms.</p> <p>The FutureTalk Awards programme, now in its second round, called for schools to submit proposals for literacy and geography projects incorporating ICT in a bid to receive funding. Two other school groups were each awarded runners-up prizes of \u00a35,000.</p> <p>One More Year, as the winning project is titled, will be coordinated by Sean O'Sullivan, deputy head at Frank Wise, a special school for pupils with severe learning difficulties. They will work with six teenage special needs students from the local comprehensive, Banbury school, where integrated classes are held every week. Brockworth School, in rural Gloucester, and Abbey Wood School, in inner London, will serve a support role, providing feedback and ideas from two very different points of view.</p> <p>\"We want to make sure that this calendar is as unique to Banbury as possible,\" says O'Sullivan, \"so we will regularly check with the other schools if they have any similar monuments or events in their towns. The pupils can also share comments and thoughts by email and fax. With this funding, we can communicate with outside schools and produce a high-quality, commercial project.\"</p> <p>The calendar will link a topical or historical aspect of the Banbury area to each month, researched on the internet by the students.

      "bodyText": "The idea of the 2001 Banbury Calendar may not inspire as much excitement as the Sports Illustrated version, but it's sparked a stream of excited emails across England. As the winners of the BT FutureTalk School Awards, Frank Wise School, Banbury School, Brockworth Comprehensive and Abbey Wood's School have been awarded \u00a325,000 to create a local calendar in their classrooms. The FutureTalk Awards programme, now in its second round, called for schools to submit proposals for literacy and geography projects incorporating ICT in a bid to receive funding. Two other school groups were each awarded runners-up prizes of \u00a35,000. One More Year, as the winning project is titled, will be coordinated by Sean O'Sullivan, deputy head at Frank Wise, a special school for pupils with severe learning difficulties. They will work with six teenage special needs students from the local comprehensive, Banbury school, where integrated classes are held every week. Brockworth School, in rural Gloucester, and Abbey Wood School, in inner London, will serve a support role, providing feedback and ideas from two very different points of view. \"We want to make sure that this calendar is as unique to Banbury as possible,\" says O'Sullivan, \"so we will regularly check with the other schools if they have any similar monuments or events in their towns. The pupils can also share comments and thoughts by email and fax. With this funding, we can communicate with outside schools and produce a high-quality, commercial project.\" The calendar will link a topical or historical aspect of the Banbury area to each month, researched on the internet by the students. They will take digital photographs, assist the design and image manipulation, and write the accompanying text. Others will help choose graphics and photos on modified laptops loaded with symbol software. \"Most of our students have profound difficulties and are not able to use verbal communication, while others have very basic levels of reading, writing and speech,\" says O'Sullivan. \"The project will use motivation to push them to realise they can do much more than they give themselves credit for. When pupils know it matters, it motivates them, and this gives them a huge boost. \"By selling the calendar to friends, residents and tourists, they'll put far more into it.\" Each student will be set individual literacy-skills targets to meet through the drafting and editing of the calendar's text. The ongoing project will be featured on Frank Wise School's website. In second place, Lea junior school, in Berkshire, and Hawkes Farm primary school, in East Sussex, received \u00a35,000 for their \"Poetry Talks\" proposal. The project will involve both schools' year five pupils writing a narrative poem as a group, culminating in a live reading of the finished piece by video conferencing.

The nervous voices belong to 25 first-year A-level maths students from five inner London schools. \"You at Cambridge\" is Dr Helen Mason, one of the UK's sharpest minds in mathematics and 100 miles away on the end of a phone line. She is giving the first part of a video conference on her specialist subject: the sun and waves. Do they know, for instance, that the sun emits more energy per second than humans have used since the beginning of civilisation?

The 90-minute two-way session at John Kelly Girls' Technology College, Dollis Hill in north-west London, is sponsored by Nesta (National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts). It is part of the Millennium Maths \"Motivate\" project, an education through video conferencing scheme that links top mathematicians with secondary schools to inspire pupils to aim for the top in their subject. In an initial 20-minute session, Dr Mason talks about her work and how she became a mathematician, mentions her part in the recent discovery of solar tornados and how maths has enabled her to estimate how hot the sun is. Diagrams, pictures and movies are projected on a wall screen via two dedicated ISDN lines linked to a video-conferencing machine at each end of the link. Questions flow from the floor: \"How did you overcome difficulties as a woman student and will it be easier for us now?\" asks Lila Harrar, 17, from John Kelly. The answer: \"What I did find difficult was people thinking I was strange doing maths, because I didn't find it strange. It's something I enjoy doing. If you enjoy doing maths and science you should do it.\" \"Why does the sun move at its poles and equator at different rates?\" asks another. \"I'll have to check on that,\" says Dr Mason. \"See if you can find out before next time.\" At the end of the session, interposed with short breaks, the magic of face-to-face contact is already working. \"You see what she's achieved, how far she has gone in her career, how motivated she is,\" says Lila, who was seriously considering medicine before the conference, but is now contemplating maths at university. \"I thought it would just be teaching and not such deep research.

New targets set for failing schools may isolate these children still further as the focus tightens on a narrow cohort of potential D-graders who can be nudged up to a grade C.</p> <p>Faced with such difficulties, you could simplify work, reduce amounts and use larger text.

Voice-recognition software has finally come of age and certain students will be liberated by the opportunity to speak their thoughts. After 12 minutes' training, the new IBM software, ViaVoice, was returning stunning levels of accuracy. At a recent conference, I gave a short opening address into the machine and counted only two errors.</p> <p>There are also many examples of electronic writing frames and support software where students can compose written work by clicking on a storehouse of words and phrases. This moves them forward from the blank page and gives them the confidence to get started as well as a sense of achievement. </p> <p> Crick's new Wordbar, leading on from the excellent Clicker, is one of the most powerful recent additions to this stable. Wordbar sits across the bottom of the computer screen and offers instant point and click access to banks of words and phrases. </p> <p>Teachers also need the chance to experiment with graphical tools which will give students alternative points of access in a text-ridden curriculum. Software such as Inspiration allows visual mapping to replace text, allowing you to build boxes to represent key points. These boxes can then be filled with pictures and text and links established to other ideas. It's an ideal summary device, and linked to a large screen display it provides a whole-class thinking and review tool.</p> <p>Some headteachers and advisers in Hammersmith recently used the software as part of a course on 21st-century learning. \"Absolutely brilliant\" was the verdict as the key issues of the training were displayed along with images and comments from the day in one easy-to-follow concept map. </p> <p>Perhaps the most innovative alternative to text-only learning is being pioneered by Little Heath school in Redbridge where they have set up their own radio station to run across the school network. Students act as disc jockeys and splice dedications between digital move files in standard MP3 format. These can be broadcast live or saved for later transmission. Teachers are recording two-minute \"homework help\" programmes to which the students listen avidly. The aim is to move towards a talk-radio format where staff and students will prepare talk shows on curriculum areas.</p> <p>All the tools to get you up and running are available free on the internet.

There are also many examples of electronic writing frames and support software where students can compose written work by clicking on a storehouse of words and phrases. This moves them forward from the blank page and gives them the confidence to get started as well as a sense of achievement. Crick's new Wordbar, leading on from the excellent Clicker, is one of the most powerful recent additions to this stable. Wordbar sits across the bottom of the computer screen and offers instant point and click access to banks of words and phrases. Teachers also need the chance to experiment with graphical tools which will give students alternative points of access in a text-ridden curriculum. Software such as Inspiration allows visual mapping to replace text, allowing you to build boxes to represent key points. These boxes can then be filled with pictures and text and links established to other ideas. It's an ideal summary device, and linked to a large screen display it provides a whole-class thinking and review tool. Some headteachers and advisers in Hammersmith recently used the software as part of a course on 21st-century learning. \"Absolutely brilliant\" was the verdict as the key issues of the training were displayed along with images and comments from the day in one easy-to-follow concept map. Perhaps the most innovative alternative to text-only learning is being pioneered by Little Heath school in Redbridge where they have set up their own radio station to run across the school network. Students act as disc jockeys and splice dedications between digital move files in standard MP3 format. These can be broadcast live or saved for later transmission. Teachers are recording two-minute \"homework help\" programmes to which the students listen avidly. The aim is to move towards a talk-radio format where staff and students will prepare talk shows on curriculum areas. All the tools to get you up and running are available free on the internet. Visit www. shoutcast.com and follow the guidance on setting up your own digital radio station.

      "bodyText": "The Cruickshank banking review could throw a spanner in the works of the \u00a321bn Royal Bank of Scotland-NatWest merger announced last month. Don Cruickshank, head of the review team, yesterday called on the government to clamp down on \"anti-competitive mergers\" in the banking industry, and indicated he believed the RBS-NatWest link-up should be referred to the competition commission. Both institutions are leading players in the provision of banking services to small businesses, a market which is already very concentrated - NatWest, Barclays, Lloyds TSB and HSBC hold more than 80% of all small and medium-sized enterprises accounts. NatWest and RBS have a especially strong presence in the north-west of England. Mr Cruickshank said he would expect the merger \"to be of particular interest to the competition commission\" if the government decided to follow his recommendations. The review document recommends \"a stronger policy framework for government's approach to banking services which prevents anti-competitive mergers in the banking industry\". In their reform of merger law, ministers should ensure that the proposed new competition-based test for assessing mergers takes full account of a range of factors so as to ensure consumers receive a fair share of the benefits. In the meantime, the government should refer all mergers between financial institutions to the competition commission. Main points The Cruickshank review also recommends: 1. Regulating the payment systems operated by the banks such as cash machine networks, and the clearing scheme for cheques. The review proposes that banks wishing to be part of a payment system would have to obtain a licence from the Treasury. It suggests the creation of a new regulator, PayCom, which would be independent of the industry and other regulators, whose job it would be to monitor compliance with this new regime. 2. That the government should consider setting up an independent \"financial services consumer council\" covering all financial services. \"There is a need for a strong, independent consumer voice at the heart of the regulatory system,\" it states. 3. Improving the complaint-handling procedures both for personal and small business customers, with \"clear and objective standards\" for banks to be judged against.",

      "body": "<p>First there was wicket-cam, then there was player-cam, now natural history producers have muscled in on the technological advances available to sports, and created eagle-cam, wolf-cam and cheetah-cam. </p> <p>The BBC's natural history unit has borrowed the techniques of television sport to harness miniaturised cameras to some of the world's most elusive animals. Using a combination of eagle-cam, slow-motion replay, computer animation and reverse-angle filming, producers can for the first time show exactly what occurs when a predator alights on its prey. </p> <p>The footage will be screened in Predators, a five-part BBC1 series beginning in May. The highlight of the series is film which captures the split-second moment when the predator pounces or the prey escapes. </p> <p>Producers and cameramen spent months experimenting with miniaturised cameras and lightweight harnesses, finally reducing the weight of camera, harness, transmitter, battery and two aerials to a mere four ounces, so that the animal would be able to act normally. </p> <p>These second generation animal-cams are so light the wearer does not notice their presence - previous television experiments have attached a camera to an eagle, but it was so heavy the bird could do little more than fly. </p> <p>David Wallace, the series producer of Predators, said: \"It will be the first time you will ever see an eagle attack a mouse because the cameras are getting so small now that it's practical to do these things in a way that the animals don't notice.\" </p> <p>Having got the shots, the team had to slow the footage by up to 100 times to be able to make out the moment of impact, such is the speed of the animals' movements. </p> <p>\"We have used multiple angles, slow motion and the on-board perspective of eagle-cam to tell the story,\" Mr Wallace said. </p> <p>Predators forms part of BBC1's \u00a3242m spring and summer schedule, announced yesterday by the channel's controller, Peter Salmon. </p> <p>Mr Salmon, who had asked for an extra \u00a3100m on the channel's budget, said he expected to have more money to spend on programmes. </p> <p>\"My hope, and the omens are good, is that in the very near future BBC1 will have more money and more resources for more seasons as original and diverse as the one we are launching today,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We have a new director-general, a new licence fee settlement and a new TV world,\" he added. </p> <p>\"There is a real and tangible sense of excitement and adventure at the BBC,\" he claimed. \"Everything is possible.\" </p> <p>Greg Dyke, the BBC director general, has made it clear in his first few months in charge that he intends to cut the costs of management and bureaucracy at the corporation and divert funds into programme making. </p> <p><strong>Spring highlights</strong></p> <p><strong> Drama</strong><br>Already dubbed the BBC's answer to Friends, the comedy drama Hearts and Bones follows a group of friends from the Midlands as they move to London. The cast of impossibly glamorous thirtysomethings includes Dervla Kirwan and Hugo Speer. </p> <p>Border Cafe, a witty drama series set on the Welsh border, is the story of a pop star who quits her life of fame to run a cafe. It is written by Tim Firth, creator of Preston Front. </p> <p><strong> Comedy</strong><br>The Radio 4 series Chambers transfers to BBC1 with Sarah Lancashire, John Bird and James Fleet as three barristers sharing offices. </p> <p>Alistair McGowan gets his own series, impersonating, among others, Michael Owen and Pierce Brosnan. </p> <p><strong> Factual</strong><br>The BBC pinches an ITV idea with 7 Up 2000, following seven-year-olds as they grow up in a long-running series. </p> <p>Two new science and natural history programmes are Cousins - about primates - and Phobias, examining fear. </p> <p><strong> Sport</strong><br>The BBC is pitching itself as the home of Euro 2000, though ITV shares the rights.

      "bodyText": "First there was wicket-cam, then there was player-cam, now natural history producers have muscled in on the technological advances available to sports, and created eagle-cam, wolf-cam and cheetah-cam. The BBC's natural history unit has borrowed the techniques of television sport to harness miniaturised cameras to some of the world's most elusive animals. Using a combination of eagle-cam, slow-motion replay, computer animation and reverse-angle filming, producers can for the first time show exactly what occurs when a predator alights on its prey. The footage will be screened in Predators, a five-part BBC1 series beginning in May. The highlight of the series is film which captures the split-second moment when the predator pounces or the prey escapes. Producers and cameramen spent months experimenting with miniaturised cameras and lightweight harnesses, finally reducing the weight of camera, harness, transmitter, battery and two aerials to a mere four ounces, so that the animal would be able to act normally. These second generation animal-cams are so light the wearer does not notice their presence - previous television experiments have attached a camera to an eagle, but it was so heavy the bird could do little more than fly. David Wallace, the series producer of Predators, said: \"It will be the first time you will ever see an eagle attack a mouse because the cameras are getting so small now that it's practical to do these things in a way that the animals don't notice.\" Having got the shots, the team had to slow the footage by up to 100 times to be able to make out the moment of impact, such is the speed of the animals' movements. \"We have used multiple angles, slow motion and the on-board perspective of eagle-cam to tell the story,\" Mr Wallace said. Predators forms part of BBC1's \u00a3242m spring and summer schedule, announced yesterday by the channel's controller, Peter Salmon. Mr Salmon, who had asked for an extra \u00a3100m on the channel's budget, said he expected to have more money to spend on programmes. \"My hope, and the omens are good, is that in the very near future BBC1 will have more money and more resources for more seasons as original and diverse as the one we are launching today,\" he said. \"We have a new director-general, a new licence fee settlement and a new TV world,\" he added. \"There is a real and tangible sense of excitement and adventure at the BBC,\" he claimed. \"Everything is possible.\" Greg Dyke, the BBC director general, has made it clear in his first few months in charge that he intends to cut the costs of management and bureaucracy at the corporation and divert funds into programme making. Spring highlights Drama Already dubbed the BBC's answer to Friends, the comedy drama Hearts and Bones follows a group of friends from the Midlands as they move to London. The cast of impossibly glamorous thirtysomethings includes Dervla Kirwan and Hugo Speer. Border Cafe, a witty drama series set on the Welsh border, is the story of a pop star who quits her life of fame to run a cafe. It is written by Tim Firth, creator of Preston Front. Comedy The Radio 4 series Chambers transfers to BBC1 with Sarah Lancashire, John Bird and James Fleet as three barristers sharing offices. Alistair McGowan gets his own series, impersonating, among others, Michael Owen and Pierce Brosnan. Factual The BBC pinches an ITV idea with 7 Up 2000, following seven-year-olds as they grow up in a long-running series. Two new science and natural history programmes are Cousins - about primates - and Phobias, examining fear. Sport The BBC is pitching itself as the home of Euro 2000, though ITV shares the rights. Among the sports highlights is a new Sunday morning football show, Football Fever, aimed at children.",

Up until now she has been relatively quiet, simply sticking a new poncey menu in the club's carvery and getting Bruce Oldfield to design a new strip (design, to the Fiver's mind, being somewhat immaterial when the kit is in yellow and green). But now she's decided to get hands on.</p> <p>Not that that means handouts to buy new players. Oh no. Delia, who is \"not a mega- or multi-millionaire, just an ordinary one\", expects the club to generate its own income through enterprises like the club's proposed new conferencing facilities (expected to known as The Delia Smith Business Centre).

Delia is the majority shareholder in Norwich City, sharing a 58% stake in the club with husband Michael Wynn Jones (\"Not roasted salmon with pecorino and pesto topping again darling!?!\"). Up until now she has been relatively quiet, simply sticking a new poncey menu in the club's carvery and getting Bruce Oldfield to design a new strip (design, to the Fiver's mind, being somewhat immaterial when the kit is in yellow and green). But now she's decided to get hands on. Not that that means handouts to buy new players. Oh no. Delia, who is \"not a mega- or multi-millionaire, just an ordinary one\", expects the club to generate its own income through enterprises like the club's proposed new conferencing facilities (expected to known as The Delia Smith Business Centre). Only once the club start turning a profit can they expect to climb into the heady heights of, say, the top half of the First Division. If only they had some kind of money-spinning recipe book they could sell... * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Leicester have been linked with a \u00a32m bid for West Brom striker Lee Hughes. However, West Brom chairman Paul Thompson has said, \"Lee Hughes is not for sale.\" Everton will bid \u00a35m for Celtic defender Alan Stubbs. Kenny Dalglish is to hold urgent talks to try to keep hold of the 28-year-old player who supported Everton as a boy. Leeds may offer Niall Quinn the salary increase he feels he is worth, but is unlikely to get at Sunderland. Meanwhile, Sunderland are chasing Honduran striker Milton 'Tyson' Nunez. The 5'5\" striker is looking for an English club after PAOK Salonika terminated his contract. West Ham are looking to sign Lyon striker Frederic Kanoute on loan. The 22-year-old would cost \u00a33m should Harry Redknapp then decide to make the move permanent. Nottingham Forest are poised to sign Chelsea's 19-year-old central defender John Terry on loan. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Matt Elliott and Kevin Gallacher have been recalled by Scotland boss Craig Brown for the friendly international against France on March 29. Hibs youngster Kenny Miller has missed out, however. The full squad: Douglas (Dundee), Gould (Celtic), Sullivan (Wimbledon), Boyd (Celtic), Dailly (Blackburn), Elliott (Leicester), Hendry (Coventry), O'Neil (Wolfsburg), Ritchie (Hearts), Weir (Everton), Burley (Derby), Cameron (Hearts), Davidson (Blackburn), Ferguson (Rangers), Hutchison (Everton), Johnston (Sunderland), McNamara (Celtic), Burchill (Celtic), Dodds (Rangers), Gallacher (Newcastle), McCann (Rangers). Ajax have fired coach Jan Wouters and appointed sporting director Hans Westerhof in his place until the end of the season. The Belgian city of Antwerp plans to install 30 surveillance cameras in its city centre to help with security during Euro 2000. No matches are scheduled to be played in Antwerp but the city is near the Belgian-Dutch border and the cameras will be situated in \"sensitive\" areas where large crowds could gather. Derby goalkeeper Russell Hoult's proposed move to Portsmouth has broken down over personal terms. The teams had agreed a \u00a3300,000 fee. Meanwhile, Pompey defender Jason Cundy has been ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury. Francis Jeffers has resumed training and could be back in action for Everton early next month after missing the last eight games with ankle ligament damage. Manchester United defender John O'Shea has returned to Old Trafford following a two-month loan spell at Bournemouth. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: The Big Match (10pm) Valencia v Manchester United, and Sideshow Bob Wilson is in a right state. \"Apparently everyone's getting fed up with Des.

      "body": "<p>It was perhaps the most inspiring concert I had ever attended. An unusual quartet - flute, oboe, cello, harp - joined by five nurses and seven elderly dementia patients, sitting in a circle in a room at Acton hospital in west London, improvising, developing musical ideas, finding out about each other. It was a triumph for music, the NHS and simple goodness (why am I embarrassed to use that word?). </p> <p>Sinfonia 21, the resident orchestra at London's Imperial College, has just embarked on a three-year research study at Acton, called the Shimmer Project, to assess whether musical interaction - there is no other satisfactory term to describe it - can benefit dementia patients. The idea is that, rather than play a conventional programme for patients, a group of professional musicians comes in each week and plays with them, letting the patients dictate where the music goes. The patients conduct, beat drums, pluck strings, sing, engage in any way they wish. The hope is that dementia sufferers who, in some cases, have lost the capacity for coherent speech can find a new outlet through music. </p> <p>The scheme is rooted in the notions of empowerment and identity. At the beginning of the one-hour session, each of the patients - all of whom are resident at Acton hospital - is asked his or her name. Some lack the confidence to say it; others can no longer remember it. By the end, the whole group is reciting each name in turn, creating a mesmerising chant that overlays the musical theme. It is a striking assertion of identity - individual and collective. </p> <p>The project is a collaboration between Sinfonia 21 (whose musicians have had two years of training for work in hospitals), Music for Life (which provided the training), and a medical research team led by Christopher Bulpitt, professor of geriatric medicine at Hammersmith hospital. \"Music interaction involves the response of musicians to patients and vice versa,\" says Prof Bulpitt. \"It must be contrasted with just playing suitable music. Music may help the confused elderly person in the short term, but the hope is that interacting with musicians and the music will also produce benefits long after the music stops.\" </p> <p>Prof Bulpitt's researchers will log patients' behaviour during and after sessions to see whether there is any change. The hope is that the effects of being empowered, the confidence it engenders and the socialisation provided by this group activity will have a knock-on effect on the wards, providing a demonstrable improvement in dementia sufferers' quality of life. </p> <p>Quantifying improvements may prove difficult, but there is no doubting the evidence of one's eyes and ears. At the session I attended, one patient was very reluctant to enter the room - she could be heard crying in the corridor outside - but as soon as she did join the group, she relaxed, embraced the harpist and took part in the music-making. Barriers were quickly broken down, wary silence gave way to laughter, and the music took shape. </p> <p>It was both funny and moving to see patients conducting the musicians, with the latter following precisely their hand and eye movements in an attempt to give expression to their feelings. \"Music is a natural form of communication that can perhaps be easier than language,\" says Katy Dent, development manager at Sinfonia 21, which combines educational and outreach work with concerts majoring in contemporary music (its role at Imperial College is part of an initiative to bring the arts and sciences into some degree of harmony). </p> <p>\"The aim is that the music should be affected by what is coming from the residents,\" says Linda Rose, director of Music for Life, which trains musicians to work with frail elderly people in an interactive way. \"Untrained musicians might provide a straight performance. You wouldn't know whether the listeners had been affected or not; the relationship wouldn't build in the way that it does in this project. Here the music is affected by the patients. The musicians may take in a repertoire of four or five ideas, but these are only starting points, and what develops from those is a result of the interaction.\" </p> <p>Rose emphasises the demands made on the musicians. \"It can be very stressful just to walk into a room with people with dementia, to feel a reality that is different from our own reality,\" she says. \"It's difficult to know how to respond, and it takes a lot of emotional stamina to do this work, just as it does for the carers. The relationship with the carers and with the patients' families [who can, if they wish, attend the sessions] is a very important part of the work. We are developing a sort of community.\" </p> <p>\"It is a way of seeing another side of somebody,\" says Sarah Dunn, a research nurse on the project. \"It might have been thought that the more severely affected in the group would not have been capable of learning new things, of interacting, of communicating. This shows the carers a different side of their residents.\" </p> <p>The Shimmer Project is an example of what Rose calls \"person-centred care\". \"We are taking account of the person behind the dementia, rather than looking at dementia as a condition,\" she says. It isn't just the patients who need to be reminded of their identities; society too must be encouraged not to objectify and marginalise people with dementia. </p> <p>\"We want to say that these people should be treated with respect, not just hidden away and forgotten,\" says Katy Dent. \"Other cultures seem to have more respect for the elderly. Developing emotional care for people with dementia is on the increase; there is now a move towards person-centred care and this project fits into that.\" Dunn agrees: \"We live in an ageist society: young is beautiful, old is ugly, and you have double jeopardy if you are an older person with dementia.\" </p> <p>Rose stresses the risks the musicians run in taking part in these sessions - there is nowhere to hide musically or emotionally - but she says the rewards can also be considerable. \"The musicians benefit as artists: their music is developing and their perceptions are developing. They are highly motivated.\" </p> <p>That is certainly true of flautist Tony Robb, who took part in the session I sat in on. \"You have to treat this with as much respect and concentration as you do when you sit down to play a piece by Schoenberg,\" he told me afterwards. \"There are two main points to doing this work. The first is to look after the patients and make sure they are never compromised or distressed. The second is to be true to oneself as a musician, so we try at all times to maintain the highest possible musical standards within an improvisatory framework, which is a tall order. </p> <p>\"The key is to be true to them and what they are doing. It's very easy to go into a situation like this, play a few pre-arranged pieces, get them all to clap or maybe beat time to it, and feel 'Right, we've done a bit of community work.' We don't try to impose our ideas on them, we try to get them to take control, and it's wonderful if they instigate the music. If we can get them to take control of some aspect of their lives, which most of the time they don't get the chance to do, then we feel we've done a good job.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>Dietary supplements are one of our biggest growth industries - greedily embraced as an antidote to increasingly hectic lifestyles, abnormal eating habits, and sporadic efforts to keep fit. </p> <p>Not so long ago, anything more exotic than cod liver oil was laughed off as mumbo-jumbo. But by last year we were spending \u00a3360m annually on the likes of pine bark, royal jelly, green-lipped mussels and ginseng in the hope of warding off everything from hangovers and spots to depression and lung cancer. However, behind skyrocketing sales and the bewildering expansion of product ranges, concerns are mounting over the safety of these \" natural\" products, which are classified as foods, and therefore undergo less rigorous testing than medicines. </p> <p>Our knowlege of how and why vitamins and minerals work - especially in highly refined doses isolated from normal dietary intake - is still sketchy. Many studies have shown that, at best, supplements have no effect at all on our health. Others suggest they may be harmful. Most recently, a shadow has fallen over vitamin C supplements, regularly taken by 10m Britons, including Baroness Thatcher and Michael Portillo, and thought to boost the immune system and tackle free radicals, which play a role in heart disease and cancer. </p> <p>Last week, results from a study at the University of Southern California showed the carotid arteries of middle-aged people taking daily 500mg doses thickened two and a half times faster than normal - among smokers the rate was five times faster. The study was relatively small (573 people) but the results are potentially alarming.

      "bodyText": "Dietary supplements are one of our biggest growth industries - greedily embraced as an antidote to increasingly hectic lifestyles, abnormal eating habits, and sporadic efforts to keep fit. Not so long ago, anything more exotic than cod liver oil was laughed off as mumbo-jumbo. But by last year we were spending \u00a3360m annually on the likes of pine bark, royal jelly, green-lipped mussels and ginseng in the hope of warding off everything from hangovers and spots to depression and lung cancer. However, behind skyrocketing sales and the bewildering expansion of product ranges, concerns are mounting over the safety of these \" natural\" products, which are classified as foods, and therefore undergo less rigorous testing than medicines. Our knowlege of how and why vitamins and minerals work - especially in highly refined doses isolated from normal dietary intake - is still sketchy. Many studies have shown that, at best, supplements have no effect at all on our health. Others suggest they may be harmful. Most recently, a shadow has fallen over vitamin C supplements, regularly taken by 10m Britons, including Baroness Thatcher and Michael Portillo, and thought to boost the immune system and tackle free radicals, which play a role in heart disease and cancer. Last week, results from a study at the University of Southern California showed the carotid arteries of middle-aged people taking daily 500mg doses thickened two and a half times faster than normal - among smokers the rate was five times faster. The study was relatively small (573 people) but the results are potentially alarming. Although no one suffered major illnesses during the trial, atherosclerosis causes poor blood flow, associated with heart disease and strokes. The government recommends a daily 40mg dose of vitamin C, 12 times less than the amount used in the American study: 10 mg a day is enough to prevent scurvy.

In miscarriage awareness week, that's the most obvious question to ask, but the rather surprising answer is that no one knows. \"There's no evidence,\" says Ruth Bender Atik of the Miscarriage Association. </p> <p>Lamentably, it seems no one is counting. It's true that charting the true number would be difficult, since some women mistake a miscarriage for a heavy period, and others don't tell their GPs even when they know they've suffered one. But the rather surprising news is that even if you do present at your doctor's surgery or your local hospital casualty with an ending or ended pregnancy, your experience goes unrecorded. </p> <p>The best the medical profession can tell us, based on small-scale studies, is that up to 30% of pregnancies are miscarried. In the absence of evidence, though, you could be forgiven for thinking that miscarriage may be a growing problem. It's certainly a common one: I have had three myself, and at least two of my closest friends have also had them. In the past week two high-profile women, Annabel Heseltine and Lauren Booth, the prime minister's sister-in-law, have written of their pregnancy losses. </p> <p>So, are more of us losing babies, or are we simply more likely to talk about it? Atik believes that, although a minority of women do speak out, most still want it to be a private grief. For some there are practical considerations: if they don't yet have children, they may be unwilling to divulge that they're trying to have them now. For others, there's the problem of not knowing where to go; and of not knowing how far it's OK to mourn a baby who was maybe hardly a baby at all. </p> <p>On top of that, there's the feeling of failure. All of us who have miscarried, at whatever stage of our reproductive lives, have felt it, and it's a particularly abject and stark failure. A few weeks before, you were laughing and crying over your positive pregnancy test, making plans, imagining the little person you would be cuddling a year from now. Your pregnancy is the first thing you think about every morning, the last thing you think about every night. </p> <p>Then one day, without warning, there's the blood; for me, every time, it was just the tiniest drop, the merest hint of heart-stopping red. Then the terrible wait at the hospital for an ultrasound scan to check whether it was all over. Finally, in a scene almost too painful to recall, the frozen image on the screen of a baby whose tiny heart had for some reason ceased to beat. </p> <p>Why? That's what you want to know, but if they can find a reason you're one of the lucky ones. Most women who suffer one miscarriage, and then two, are simply sent home to \"try again\": it's only when you reach three consecutive losses that you qualify for help, and even then the likelihood is that, like me, you will be told the tests show nothing abnormal. </p> <p>According to Roy Farquharson, consultant obstetrician at the Liverpool Women's Hospital and an authority on miscarriage, a cause will be found in only around half of the women investigated. That's partly because it's under-researched. \"It's always been a Cinderella cause,\" says Farquharson. \"It hasn't attracted much grant money for research.\" </p> <p>As a consequence, he believes, research into miscarriage and its prevention is around 20 years behind research into infertility which, by contrast, has attracted lots of funding. What research there is has uncovered two factors that are most significant in predicting whether a woman will miscarry: maternal age and previous history of losses. </p> <p>The first, of course, is bad news at a time when many women postpone childbearing because although even a 19-year-old can have a miscarriage, a 40-year-old is at greater risk. The truth is, of course, that some pregnancies will always end in miscarriage, and indeed a proportion are due to gross abnormalities in the chromosomal make-up of the baby. </p> <p>But, contrary to popular belief, these \"abnormal\" foetuses by no means account for all miscarried pregnancies. In many cases, doctors like Farquharson believe, the \"mistake\" is in the placenta, not in the baby itself. It's in this area that research has been concentrated and significant steps forward are being made, partic ularly with regard to blood clotting abnormalities which appear to interfere with the smooth workings of the all-important placenta. </p> <p>For several years, doctors have believed that taking low-dose aspirin might iron out these clotting deficiencies, making a successful outcome much more likely. Although the studies have not conclusively proved the usefulness of aspirin, the evidence seems to suggest it is beneficial, and I am one of probably many thousands of women to put my baby's life down to the taking of low-dose aspirin. </p> <p>There is another factor, too, harder to pin down, more difficult to describe. It's a kind of confidence that pregnancy will work out, a sort of self-belief. There's no medical reason why your psychological state should affect pregnancy outcome, but studies seem to back up the argument that it does. </p> <p>Studies in Norway and elsewhere have shown that if women are given regular reassurance via ultrasound scans that their baby is alive and well, they are more likely to make it through the crucial 12-week barrier - and by that stage, if the baby's heart is still beating, there is a 99% chance of success. </p> <p>In my most recent pregnancy, weekly trips to the local hospital for a scan became a kind of lifeline: in many ways I existed from one week to the next and, as the weeks went by and the news was always good, I started to believe, slowly, that this time my baby would survive - as indeed she did. </p> <p>\u0095 The Miscarriage Association: 01924 200799</p>",

Prime suspects are pro-Pakistan Islamist fighters, although no one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. Indian police said that a group of uniformed gunmen entered Chati Singhpura Mattan village late on Monday night, separated adult males from their families and shot them in the street. The motive for the mass killing - apart from the casual racism which underlies much of the violence in Kashmir - appears to have been to draw the world's attention to the conflict while President Bill Clinton is visiting India. The president immediately declared his outrage at the bloodletting, and renewed his appeal to both India and Pakistan to respect the ceasefire line which divides Kashmir. That line - more properly called the Line of Control - was fixed by a short and bloody war in 1947, when both India and Pakistan gained their freedom from Britain. Kashmir was one of the semi-autonomous princely states whose rulers could decide which of the new countries their subjects should join. Kashmir is overwhelmingly Muslim, but its maharajah was a Hindu, who opted for India. Pakistani irregular forces invaded the state, but were forestalled by an audacious Indian army airborne operation, which established control of the Kashmir Valley and the state summer capital, Srinagar. Pakistan took control of a western sliver of Kashmir, plus the sprawling northern mountain territories of Gilgit and Baltistan. This territory is known today as Azad (free) Kashmir. India and Pakistan have twice more fought all-out wars. In 1965, the issue was again Kashmir.

No one has claimed responsibility for the massacre, but Indian army officers had warned of violence by pro-separatist militants during Mr Clinton's visit to the subcontinent to calm tensions between India and Pakistan. The killing marked an ominous twist to the conflict in Kashmir, the subject of a 50-year-old territorial dispute and the immediate cause of two wars between India and Pakistan. In the past, Kashmiri militants conducted random killings of Hindus, but the Sikhs were considered neutral and had never been before a target in the campaign to split Kashmir from India.

The statement said the two countries would \"resolve to create a closer and qualitatively new relationship\" and hold regular summit meetings. But US officials made clear there were limits to how close the two countries could be unless India agreed to restrain its nuclear programme by signing the comprehensive test ban treaty. India and Pakistan shocked the world with tit-for-tat nuclear tests two years ago, making Kashmir an even more dangerous flashpoint.

      "body": "<b>Why is Stephen Lawrence back in the news?</b> <br> His mother, Doreen, is to appear on BBC1's Crimewatch UK programme (tonight at 9.35pm) to make a fresh appeal for information on his murder. <p><b>Does the programme itself have anything new to say? </b><br> It will show a computerised reconstruction of the killing in Eltham, south London, on April 22, 1993. The Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner John Grieve, head of the race and violent crime unit, will also appeal for witnesses or anyone with any other information.</p> <p><b>Are there new suspects? </b><br> Not according to the BBC, which makes it clear in a news story about the programme that the police are concentrating on the five young white men arrested in the aftermath of the murder. \"Seven years have passed since the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence, but we know several people out there can turn the keys to locking up those responsible. Allegiances change over time. We nearly have the full picture and I am relying on Crimewatch viewers to help complete it,\" Mr Grieve will say.</p> <p><b>Who are the five and why have they not been convicted? </b><br> Neil and Jamie Acourt, Gary Dobson, David Norris and Luke Knight were all arrested within six weeks of the killing. Neil Acourt and Knight were charged with murder but the crown prosecutors dropped the charges, for lack of evidence. The Lawrence family started private proceedings against the five on the second anniversary of Stephen's death. The cases against Jamie Acourt and David Norris were again dropped for lack of evidence. The other three were committed for trial at the Old Bailey, but the case collapsed when the judge ruled that identification evidence was inadmissible. </p> <p><b>Having been discharged, surely they can no longer be prosecuted for the same offence? </b><br> Possibly they can. The so-called double jeopardy rule, a cornerstone of English law for centuries whereby you cannot be tried twice for the same crime, is under review, precisely because such a review was recommended by the Macpherson report into the Lawrence case.</p> <p><b>Any other outstanding legal business? </b><br> Doreen Lawrence and her estranged husband, Neville, are suing 42 officers of the Met, including its chief at the time, Sir Paul Condon, for damages.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/lawrence\">News Unlimited special report: the Stephen Lawrence case</a> <br> <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_684000/684530.stm\" target=\"_new\">BBC coverage</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/lawrence/Story/0,2763,26027,00.html\">Chronology of events</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm42/4262/sli-00.htm\" target=\"_new\">The Lawrence Inquiry</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/macpherson\">The Macpherson report</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.blink.org.uk/campaign/stevelaw/slmain.htm\" target=\"_new\">Stephen Lawrence Family Campaign</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.newsunlimited.co.uk/lawrence/Story/0,2763,25544,00.html\">Double Jeopardy under fire</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk\" target=\"_new\">Metropolitan Police</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Why is Stephen Lawrence back in the news? His mother, Doreen, is to appear on BBC1's Crimewatch UK programme (tonight at 9.35pm) to make a fresh appeal for information on his murder. Does the programme itself have anything new to say? It will show a computerised reconstruction of the killing in Eltham, south London, on April 22, 1993. The Metropolitan police deputy assistant commissioner John Grieve, head of the race and violent crime unit, will also appeal for witnesses or anyone with any other information. Are there new suspects? Not according to the BBC, which makes it clear in a news story about the programme that the police are concentrating on the five young white men arrested in the aftermath of the murder. \"Seven years have passed since the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence, but we know several people out there can turn the keys to locking up those responsible. Allegiances change over time. We nearly have the full picture and I am relying on Crimewatch viewers to help complete it,\" Mr Grieve will say. Who are the five and why have they not been convicted? Neil and Jamie Acourt, Gary Dobson, David Norris and Luke Knight were all arrested within six weeks of the killing. Neil Acourt and Knight were charged with murder but the crown prosecutors dropped the charges, for lack of evidence. The Lawrence family started private proceedings against the five on the second anniversary of Stephen's death. The cases against Jamie Acourt and David Norris were again dropped for lack of evidence. The other three were committed for trial at the Old Bailey, but the case collapsed when the judge ruled that identification evidence was inadmissible. Having been discharged, surely they can no longer be prosecuted for the same offence? Possibly they can. The so-called double jeopardy rule, a cornerstone of English law for centuries whereby you cannot be tried twice for the same crime, is under review, precisely because such a review was recommended by the Macpherson report into the Lawrence case. Any other outstanding legal business? Doreen Lawrence and her estranged husband, Neville, are suing 42 officers of the Met, including its chief at the time, Sir Paul Condon, for damages.

The singer-actress already has a three-year-old daughter, Lourdes, fathered by her fitness instructor Carlos Leon. For the past 18 months, the entertainer has been dating the 31-year-old Ritchie, who shot to fame with his hit gangster caper Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.

The Oscar-nominated film-maker is currently developing an adaptation of the Pat Barker novel, <strong>The Eye on the Door</strong>, from a script by Ol Parker. A dark psychological espionage thriller set in London during world war one, The Eye in the Door will be produced by Demme's own production company, Clinica Estetico.

The actor has recently lectured Tony Blair on nuclear disarmament (see today's story) and signed on to play the lead in Steven Soderbergh's drugs drama Traffic, and must still find a window in his schedule to marry his pregnant fiancee Catherine Zeta-Jones. Criminal Law will cast Douglas as a law professor who devises the theoretical \"perfect murder\" to test his students only to find the formula put into practice by a rogue member of the class. Presumably, the makers could even have titled the film A Perfect Murder, had the name not already been bagged by yet another picture on the cluttered Douglas CV. </p> <p>In keeping with the Americanisation of the adaptation of <strong>Nick Hornby's High Fidelity</strong>, apple-pie rocker Bruce Springsteen will crop up in the film version, which is released in the US this Friday. High Fidelity may boast a British director in Stephen Frears, but the action has been transplanted from London to Chicago and the hero changed from a Brit to a Yank (in the form of John Cusack). The notoriously camera-shy Springsteen (who even hates lip-synching in his music videos) plays himself in a cameo, dispensing rock'n'roll wisdom to the tale's lovelorn hero. Co-screenwriter and producer DV DeVincentis claims that Cusack himself was instrumental in getting the Boss on board. \"John called Bruce and for some reason he showed up,\" DeVincentis told Entertainment Weekly.</p>",

Stollmeyer allowed himself to be interviewed, and then left the female journalist to her own devices within the hallowed precincts of the Club. </p> <p> It was not a day of cricket, so the place was not full - there was just a sprinkling of stalwarts sunning their bones at the bar. Though, strictly speaking, it was off-limits to women, she had been seen talking to the Club president and so she was mostly ignored until she made a big mistake.</p> <p> It was a hot day, and the poor ignorant woman, feeling thirsty, thought to quench her thirst with a Coke at the QPCC bar. She was told at the bar that they don't serve women. She asked for a drink of water instead, thinking that if they couldn't sell her a Coke, they would at least provide a glass of water to a thirsty person. Not only was her request denied, but it was accompanied by sneers and jeers from the gentlemen in the precincts of the bar. She left, feeling humiliated.</p> <p> That was some years ago, and what the gentlemen of the Queen's Park Cricket Club would say is that they have come a long way since then. They now allow women to have lunch at the Club - that is if they are properly escorted; and of course, that is, when there is no all-male function there. I myself have had lunch there recently, and the food was as reasonable as the prices.</p> <p> They also allow women who are wives or girlfriends of members to use the gym facilities at certain times. They even allow women to attend their family-day activities, and sometimes even their social events, that is, those which are open to the public.</p> <p> As a matter of fact, there is one place where women can enter during cricket games: the President's Box. There, women who are the wives or escorts of those privileged enough to be invited by the President of the QPCC can enter in all their feminine finery. That would have been the only way a woman like Pamela Nicholson, who was once the Minister of Sport in this country could have been entertained by the Club.

      "bodyText": "Some years ago, a female journalist went to the Queen's Park Cricket Club to interview Jeffrey Stollmeyer, the former West Indies captain and president of the QPCC. Stollmeyer allowed himself to be interviewed, and then left the female journalist to her own devices within the hallowed precincts of the Club. It was not a day of cricket, so the place was not full - there was just a sprinkling of stalwarts sunning their bones at the bar. Though, strictly speaking, it was off-limits to women, she had been seen talking to the Club president and so she was mostly ignored until she made a big mistake. It was a hot day, and the poor ignorant woman, feeling thirsty, thought to quench her thirst with a Coke at the QPCC bar. She was told at the bar that they don't serve women. She asked for a drink of water instead, thinking that if they couldn't sell her a Coke, they would at least provide a glass of water to a thirsty person. Not only was her request denied, but it was accompanied by sneers and jeers from the gentlemen in the precincts of the bar. She left, feeling humiliated. That was some years ago, and what the gentlemen of the Queen's Park Cricket Club would say is that they have come a long way since then. They now allow women to have lunch at the Club - that is if they are properly escorted; and of course, that is, when there is no all-male function there. I myself have had lunch there recently, and the food was as reasonable as the prices. They also allow women who are wives or girlfriends of members to use the gym facilities at certain times. They even allow women to attend their family-day activities, and sometimes even their social events, that is, those which are open to the public. As a matter of fact, there is one place where women can enter during cricket games: the President's Box. There, women who are the wives or escorts of those privileged enough to be invited by the President of the QPCC can enter in all their feminine finery. That would have been the only way a woman like Pamela Nicholson, who was once the Minister of Sport in this country could have been entertained by the Club. I would like to think that if she had been invited to sit in the President's Box that she at least complained about the discrimination against women at the QPCC. Yet, although the President of the QPCC has the right to invite whom he pleases into his box, he cannot offer his hospitality or, as in the case of the female journalist, his protection to women stepping outside of that safe ground. Indeed, I have been told that current President Willie Rodriguez could not even sway the adamant members when his own wife applied for membership some years ago. She too, like me, was rejected. Since Rodriguez has pointed out to me that my application's rejection was not based on my gender - though he could not tell me what it was based on - I wonder what he told his wife? Still, it wouldn't be fair to say the boys are not crawling along towards some kind of progressive thinking. Think about it: a few decades ago, Brian Charles Lara, for all his cricket talent, would not have been accepted as a member because he would have been too black. Today, his name is proudly listed as one of the QPCC members. What a pity his mother, Pearl, to whom he has paid tribute for her support, cannot watch her son from the Members' Pavilion.

The Worthington Cup winners also hope to tie up a deal for Coventry's Noel Whelan. Aston Villa are chasing Milwall wing-back Lucas Neill. The Australian international defender, a close friend of Harry Kewell, would cost John Gregory \u00a31m. Wimbledon want Spurs' reserve keeper Espen Baardsen as a replacement for Neil Sullivan, who is expected to leave the club in the summer. The Mirror Charlton hope to sign West Ham striker Paul Kitson today. The First Division leaders will take Kitson on loan until the end of the season with a view to making the move permanent in the summer.",

      "body": "<p>If you thought The Blair Witch Project was scary, try real life in Burkittsville, where last year's hit horror movie was filmed. The locals reckon that it will turn your hair white in a month. </p> <p>Since the low-budget film was made, the Maryland town has been inundated with self-styled witch-hunters, trainee exorcists, exhibitionists and assorted weirdos with video cameras. Most were apparently unaware that the movie, about the mysterious disappearance of three film students in Burkittsville's wooded hills, was a work of fiction. </p> <p>The story's cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style seems to have convinced many that Burkittsville is a community riddled with satanic rites. The intruders, from all over the country, have daubed satanic symbols in the churches, cut down town signs with a chainsaw, pranced in the cemetery, urinated in gardens and followed the citizens about as if they were a 24-hour freak show. </p> <p>All in all, this latest outbreak of cinema-driven hysteria has been a bit too much for the 214 people of Burkittsville. They are mad as hell, and they are not going to take it any more. </p> <p>As artist Andrea Cox put it: \"When you have a bunch of drunken teenagers, tripped out in their best Blair outfits, leaping around at 3am, screaming 'whoooooh' and stomping on grandma, it doesn't go down too well.\" </p> <p>So it was not altogether surprising that when a group of producers came to discuss making a sequel to the movie, they were run out of town, in a now infamous showdown between rural earthiness and urban chic at a town meeting on Valentine's day. </p> <p>\"We thought we were going to talk about the trash pick-up,\" Ms Cox said. \"But here were these people with cell-phones, silk scarves and mineral water. A little sleek line of folks who were too good to drink our water.\" </p> <p>Cultural misunderstandings turned to abuse. As one of the would-be producers got up to speak about what Blair Witch 2 could do for the town, the mayor's irascible husband, Sam Brown, yelled: \"We've already been raped. Now they want us to be prostitutes.\" </p> <p>\"Then a second person stood up and said pretty much the same thing - get out of town, so they left. Nobody was standing up and saying stay, so they left,\" said Michael Styer, who runs the Maryland Film Office. \"It was not a pleasant thing.\" </p> <p>Mr Styer's job is to attract film-makers to Maryland for the benefit of the local economy. In those terms, the Valentine's day verbal massacre was scarcely encouraging, and he does not believe that the Blair Witch producers, Artisan Entertainment, will be back. </p> <p>\"The mayor [Joyce Brown] wrote an apology to us and the company, and said she would like us to come back and reconsider. But I think it's too late. They have alternative spots,\" Mr Styer said. </p> <p>If the mayor does indeed want the film-makers to return, there is a serious rift in her family. When Mr Brown answered their telephone this week, he refused to pass the line to his wife. \"I hate to tell you but you just wasted your call,\" he shouted and hung up. </p> <p>Mr Styer believes that the town, a cluster of 19th century brick and wood houses set in rolling farmland, is failing to make use of a golden opportunity offered by a sequel, which could generate up to $10m (\u00a36.25m) for Maryland. But so far the only sign of entrepreneurial zeal is a couple of T-shirts hung in the window of a local art gallery, inscribed with half-hearted jokes like: \"Witch way to Burkittsville?\" </p> <p>For most townsfolk, antipathy to the outsiders has overcome the profit motive. The cemetery where most of the locals have ancestors buried is under police surveillance, following incidents of desecration in which at least one tombstone was upended. </p> <p>The African Methodist Episcopalian church on the outskirts of the town has been broken into four times since The Blair Witch Project emerged as last year's unexpected movie blockbuster. The church's pastor, Reverend Richard Dyson, said: \"They painted a satanic circle on the floor and words on the wall like 'God is dead' and 'the Devil is alive', and things like that.\" Rev Dyson, however, is not easily spooked. </p> <p>Curious to see what had driven people to such lengths, he rented a video of the film and watched in bewilderment as the hand-held camera pursued unseen witches and ghosts through the night forest. </p> <p>\"It's just people walking through the woods, talking and cussing, but that's just like life isn't it?\" he said. What, he wanted to know, was all the fuss about?</p>",

The intruders, from all over the country, have daubed satanic symbols in the churches, cut down town signs with a chainsaw, pranced in the cemetery, urinated in gardens and followed the citizens about as if they were a 24-hour freak show. All in all, this latest outbreak of cinema-driven hysteria has been a bit too much for the 214 people of Burkittsville. They are mad as hell, and they are not going to take it any more. As artist Andrea Cox put it: \"When you have a bunch of drunken teenagers, tripped out in their best Blair outfits, leaping around at 3am, screaming 'whoooooh' and stomping on grandma, it doesn't go down too well.\" So it was not altogether surprising that when a group of producers came to discuss making a sequel to the movie, they were run out of town, in a now infamous showdown between rural earthiness and urban chic at a town meeting on Valentine's day. \"We thought we were going to talk about the trash pick-up,\" Ms Cox said. \"But here were these people with cell-phones, silk scarves and mineral water. A little sleek line of folks who were too good to drink our water.\" Cultural misunderstandings turned to abuse. As one of the would-be producers got up to speak about what Blair Witch 2 could do for the town, the mayor's irascible husband, Sam Brown, yelled: \"We've already been raped. Now they want us to be prostitutes.\" \"Then a second person stood up and said pretty much the same thing - get out of town, so they left. Nobody was standing up and saying stay, so they left,\" said Michael Styer, who runs the Maryland Film Office. \"It was not a pleasant thing.\" Mr Styer's job is to attract film-makers to Maryland for the benefit of the local economy. In those terms, the Valentine's day verbal massacre was scarcely encouraging, and he does not believe that the Blair Witch producers, Artisan Entertainment, will be back. \"The mayor [Joyce Brown] wrote an apology to us and the company, and said she would like us to come back and reconsider. But I think it's too late. They have alternative spots,\" Mr Styer said. If the mayor does indeed want the film-makers to return, there is a serious rift in her family. When Mr Brown answered their telephone this week, he refused to pass the line to his wife. \"I hate to tell you but you just wasted your call,\" he shouted and hung up. Mr Styer believes that the town, a cluster of 19th century brick and wood houses set in rolling farmland, is failing to make use of a golden opportunity offered by a sequel, which could generate up to $10m (\u00a36.25m) for Maryland. But so far the only sign of entrepreneurial zeal is a couple of T-shirts hung in the window of a local art gallery, inscribed with half-hearted jokes like: \"Witch way to Burkittsville?\" For most townsfolk, antipathy to the outsiders has overcome the profit motive. The cemetery where most of the locals have ancestors buried is under police surveillance, following incidents of desecration in which at least one tombstone was upended. The African Methodist Episcopalian church on the outskirts of the town has been broken into four times since The Blair Witch Project emerged as last year's unexpected movie blockbuster. The church's pastor, Reverend Richard Dyson, said: \"They painted a satanic circle on the floor and words on the wall like 'God is dead' and 'the Devil is alive', and things like that.\" Rev Dyson, however, is not easily spooked. Curious to see what had driven people to such lengths, he rented a video of the film and watched in bewilderment as the hand-held camera pursued unseen witches and ghosts through the night forest. \"It's just people walking through the woods, talking and cussing, but that's just like life isn't it?\" he said. What, he wanted to know, was all the fuss about?",

      "body": "<p>Pale blonde hair, huge blue eyes, lips painted the same shade of red as the roses she holds against her naked body: Shere Hite is back in town. As well as appearing on the cover of her new book in this extravagantly romantic pose, her name appears twice: this is her autobiography, The Hite Report on Shere Hite. It is the story of a little girl from the Midwest who grew up to become a model, pose for Playboy, discover feminism and ask awkward questions about women and sex. </p> <p>It is about a childhood as American, on the face of it, as apple pie. Hite grew up in St Joseph, Missouri, with its annual Apple Blossom Festival, in a devoutly Christian household. She was a girl scout who went to her senior prom with her first boyfriend, wearing a strapless dress with a full skirt. Yet under this smooth surface, another story bubbles: Hite had a disrupted childhood, barely seeing her mother, living with her grandparents until they separated, spending a year with an aunt in Florida. Real things happened somewhere else, she concluded: \"Where I lived, things were only shadows.\" </p> <p>The book is also about her bestselling reports on sexuality and love. It describes how she was driven from the US to Europe by attacks from rightwing politicians. It is (in passing) about her happy marriage to a younger man, a German concert pianist, and her crusading insistence that women can be beautiful and intellectual. </p> <p>To prove her point, she posed six years ago for the photographer Iris Brosch, reclining like a water nymph in a Parisian fountain. \"I don't want to have to appear as only intellect in order to be taken seriously,\" she wrote in her diary at the time. Even now, in her late 50s, she is willowy, gorgeous and apparently comfortable with her body at an age when, we are told, women have to accept they are invisible. </p> <p>This is the up side of the Hite story. The down side is that her research methods have been attacked as unscientific; she has been accused of being egotistical, out of date, of manipulating the replies to her questionnaires to produce the answers she wants. And that is leaving aside the attacks of the American right, for whom she is a she-devil incarnate. </p> <p>Somewhere in this melodramatic history is a real person, desperate to give her side of the story. There is no doubt Hite has been hurt by the assaults and that the autobiography is her attempt to put the record straight. It is, in part, an expression of amazement at the way people react to her vivid presence, their failure to recognise the liberating effect of both her books and her appearance. Don't we want to hear the message that a woman can be brilliant and sexy, long after the menopause? </p> <p>As for her books, it was Hite whose original report on female sexuality in 1976 popularised the notion that most women need clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm. This assertion is so obvious now that its revolutionary impact at the time is almost forgotten. Hite was setting herself up against authorities on sex, from Freud to Kinsey, who insisted that women who didn't have vaginal orgasms were dysfunctional. When critics complained her conclusions were based on only 3,000 women, Hite responded that Freud's theories generalised from \"three upper-class Viennese women\". </p> <p>Her next book, The Hite Report on Male Sexuality in 1981, stirred up more controversy with its claim that men had been conditioned to pursue penetration at the cost of sensuality. She expanded her sample to 7,000 replies - but has never been able to deflect the charge that there is no way of verifying the results of her anonymous questionnaires. </p> <p> It was her third book, however, Women and Love: A Cultural Revolution in Progress, that really frightened the horses. It was, she now claims, the \"first time human rights standards were applied to private relationships\". Exposing the \"emotional battering\" some women endure in the name of love, Hite asked questions about its very nature and the kind of relationships women might want in future. She was attacked in articles, on the cover of Time magazine, on radio and TV. She became, she says, \"a symbolic love-hate object, a fetishistic target for fundamental extremists... who acted as if I must be stopped at any cost.\" </p> <p>If this seems hyperbolic it is because Hite is still being treated with a degree of contempt that is mystifying when you look at what she has actually said and done. The Daily Mail was at it again on Saturday, screaming: \"A sex guru or simply a charlatan?\" The article's author, Lesley Garner, struggled to be fair but concluded: \"She is a beautiful, self-promoting narcissist who attempts to blind us with what she claims is science when her books are no more than an accumulation of anecdotes from a vocal, dissatisfied minority.\" </p> <p>Beautiful? Self-promoting? Not like any of those male authors who are profiled in lads' mags and weekend newspapers, then. No wonder Hite is pissed off. In a sense, she is the victim of her own desire to be taken seriously. Her theories on sex and love ring true with so many women that it does not matter much to her readers whether she has proved them scientifically. Nor does it seem fair to criticise her methodology, yet accept at face value the findings of Alfred Kinsey, whose distorted samples have recently come to light (he generalised about male sexuality from the responses of men in prison, for instance). </p> <p>Hite emerges from her latest book as someone who has, from childhood, questioned received wisdom, endlessly testing it against her own experience. \"I had been waiting, waiting to be grown-up, free!\" she says at one point. \"I wanted to do everything - work, see the world, learn about love! Live!\" </p> <p>The mistake people make about Hite is to see her as a one-off, a single-minded narcissist with nothing on her agenda but her own advancement. On the contrary, Hite is a revolutionary in the sense 18th-century thinkers such as Olympe de Gouges or Mary Wollstonecraft would have understood. It is a depressing reminder of how far we have to go that a woman who sets out to defy sexism is still condemned as vain and attention-seeking. Strip away the sneers and what really scares people about Hite is the fact that she is a beautiful, clever, sexy, self-made woman.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Imagine a class turning up to your lesson with a laptop computer apiece and then taking them home again at the end of the day to do homework.</p> <p>Improving ICT skills would no longer be the main focus as the government's aim of \"integrating technology with everyday teaching\" would have been met.</p> <p>Well, for one group of UK schools that time is here. The old, fixed computer suite now moves from room to room - while the teachers think up ingenious new ways to teach.</p> <p>At Banstead junior school, Surrey, children use Microsoft Powerpoint - \"the slideshow software flaunted on Inset days\" - for literacy work. They turn a piece of reported speech into the direct speech they need to make a great slide presentation. Likewise, when given a presentation, they practise turning it into a report.</p> <p>And at Les Landes primary school, Jersey, the teachers have put the text of the school play, Oliver, into Microsoft Word and got the children to pick out key words about the different characters, then write character studies. Headteacher Ann Renouf says the job would be impossible without word processing, and the children now seemed to \"own\" the production.</p> <p>At Sawtry community college, Cambridgeshire, key stage three pupils used PowerPoint to give a talk in French. As vice-principal Alan Stevens says, there is more to this than good looks. \"The content is better, their confidence in reading French is better and the situation is that much richer.\"</p> <p>The schools, 28 in all, were part of a Microsoft project called Anytime, Anywhere Learning which appears to have fostered an explosion of creative teaching. The project, which aims to see every child owning a portable computer, was recently launched nationally in London by Microsoft's chairman Bill Gates.</p> <p>Gates's presence, the work going on, the motivated pupils, reactivated teachers and some interesting parent-school partnerships hint of something \"big\" to come.</p> <p>At Sawtry, what started with a single class equipped with two dozen laptops has grown so much that by this September half the school, and all the teachers, will have a laptop.</p> <p>Funding all this has got to be interesting. For some pioneers, like Bowbridge junior school in Lincolnshire, it wasn't all easy, says headteacher David Dixon. \"The money issue was the big stumbling block. Even though it felt against our principles, I looked at how the parents could finance it and we came up with \u00a37.50 per week - the parents were excited about it, too.</p> <p>\"We tried to set up a credit union but the most workable model was a charitable foundation. As result we now have two groups with laptops.\"</p> <p> Maybe the day will come when a laptop will be as ubiquitous as a pencil case, \"were it not for the cost\".</p> <p>People are worried that not all parents will be able to afford tomorrow's battery-powered, hi-tech pencil-cases. But Mark East, manager of Microsoft Education, is confident that there are ways forward: \"We've created a framework where schools or local education authorities can set up a charitable \"e-learning\" foundation, with deeds of covenant and tax-efficient ways of using money. We believe parents will contribute to technology for their child. </p> <p>\"For example, we know that 45% of families have bought a PC to help their children's learning, many over the last year, so we have a good base to work to. But we do see a need for a national charity which a local foundation could approach to request funds.\" </p> <p>While Microsoft has pledged a first \u00a31m to the collection tin, East points to a benefit for school fundraising. \"Establishing a local foundation provides a vehicle for schools to generate funds. They have a process of going out to the local community with all the tax advantages from having a charitable foundation.\" </p> <p>The community link has worked well for Bowbridge, adds David Dixon. \"Before the laptops came about we had been trying to raise the profile of learning in our community via various other means. A big benefit of the laptops is that we've had more conversations about learning with our parents than we have ever had. The parents come in, we talk about laptops and why we want them for the school. It's generated a dialogue which we wouldn't have had normally.\"</p> <p>With Anytime, Anywhere Learning and a government pledged to the ICT way, many will ask if technology is paying its way. The government agency, Becta, has led pilots with laptop handouts for schools, teachers and headteachers - and each time the vibes have been positive.</p> <p>An evaluation programme run by Lancaster university tells of improving literacy, numeracy, community links and more.

      "bodyText": "Imagine a class turning up to your lesson with a laptop computer apiece and then taking them home again at the end of the day to do homework. Improving ICT skills would no longer be the main focus as the government's aim of \"integrating technology with everyday teaching\" would have been met. Well, for one group of UK schools that time is here. The old, fixed computer suite now moves from room to room - while the teachers think up ingenious new ways to teach. At Banstead junior school, Surrey, children use Microsoft Powerpoint - \"the slideshow software flaunted on Inset days\" - for literacy work. They turn a piece of reported speech into the direct speech they need to make a great slide presentation. Likewise, when given a presentation, they practise turning it into a report. And at Les Landes primary school, Jersey, the teachers have put the text of the school play, Oliver, into Microsoft Word and got the children to pick out key words about the different characters, then write character studies. Headteacher Ann Renouf says the job would be impossible without word processing, and the children now seemed to \"own\" the production. At Sawtry community college, Cambridgeshire, key stage three pupils used PowerPoint to give a talk in French. As vice-principal Alan Stevens says, there is more to this than good looks. \"The content is better, their confidence in reading French is better and the situation is that much richer.\" The schools, 28 in all, were part of a Microsoft project called Anytime, Anywhere Learning which appears to have fostered an explosion of creative teaching. The project, which aims to see every child owning a portable computer, was recently launched nationally in London by Microsoft's chairman Bill Gates. Gates's presence, the work going on, the motivated pupils, reactivated teachers and some interesting parent-school partnerships hint of something \"big\" to come. At Sawtry, what started with a single class equipped with two dozen laptops has grown so much that by this September half the school, and all the teachers, will have a laptop. Funding all this has got to be interesting. For some pioneers, like Bowbridge junior school in Lincolnshire, it wasn't all easy, says headteacher David Dixon. \"The money issue was the big stumbling block. Even though it felt against our principles, I looked at how the parents could finance it and we came up with \u00a37.50 per week - the parents were excited about it, too. \"We tried to set up a credit union but the most workable model was a charitable foundation. As result we now have two groups with laptops.\" Maybe the day will come when a laptop will be as ubiquitous as a pencil case, \"were it not for the cost\". People are worried that not all parents will be able to afford tomorrow's battery-powered, hi-tech pencil-cases. But Mark East, manager of Microsoft Education, is confident that there are ways forward: \"We've created a framework where schools or local education authorities can set up a charitable \"e-learning\" foundation, with deeds of covenant and tax-efficient ways of using money. We believe parents will contribute to technology for their child. \"For example, we know that 45% of families have bought a PC to help their children's learning, many over the last year, so we have a good base to work to. But we do see a need for a national charity which a local foundation could approach to request funds.\" While Microsoft has pledged a first \u00a31m to the collection tin, East points to a benefit for school fundraising. \"Establishing a local foundation provides a vehicle for schools to generate funds. They have a process of going out to the local community with all the tax advantages from having a charitable foundation.\" The community link has worked well for Bowbridge, adds David Dixon. \"Before the laptops came about we had been trying to raise the profile of learning in our community via various other means. A big benefit of the laptops is that we've had more conversations about learning with our parents than we have ever had. The parents come in, we talk about laptops and why we want them for the school. It's generated a dialogue which we wouldn't have had normally.\" With Anytime, Anywhere Learning and a government pledged to the ICT way, many will ask if technology is paying its way. The government agency, Becta, has led pilots with laptop handouts for schools, teachers and headteachers - and each time the vibes have been positive. An evaluation programme run by Lancaster university tells of improving literacy, numeracy, community links and more. And then there are views from the chalkface: science teacher Andy Johnson says using ICT enables pupils to get through to the thinking part of the work far quicker. \"It's great for working in groups, great for children to put over their ideas and it's not so much me talking and chalking.\" And after just a couple of terms, David Dixon could note that year four's ICT skills in laptop group were overtaking year six. And then there are no more Friday lessons: \"We've seen an improvement in the motivation - you can do things on a Friday afternoon you would never attempt. And the special needs children also gain a lot in terms of self-esteem and motivation so the signs are very, very good.\" \u0095 Useful contacts: www.microsoft.com/uk/education/aal.

      "body": "<p>Older members of my family, Jewish refugees from eastern Europe, turn their eyes the other way each time they walk past a church. Some of them tense up when they see a cross or even hear the sound of distant church bells. As a child, I used to ask many questions about Jesus, but I received only a few reluctant answers. In the presence of some of my aunts, talk about Jesus and talk about sex evokes an identical reaction: why don't we talk about something pleasant instead? </p> <p>When I was eight or nine, I came home from school one day and revealed to my grandmother that Jesus was actually a Jew. I thought she would deny it on the spot, but she just commented sadly: \"Well, I wish he weren't. For thousands of years, every one of us Jews gets blamed for the troubles he so eagerly brought upon himself.\" I grew up nursing a strange mixture of emotions concerning \"them\" and \"us\", finding myself siding with Jesus and the Jews, the underdogs, rather than with the Church and my aunts. </p> <p>Many years later, I shared a second class compartment on a French night train with two young Catholic nuns. We passed the time in small talk, and it came out that I was from Jerusalem. As I mentioned it, they exchanged a look of alarm and then one of them asked me sheepishly, isn't Jerusalem full of Jews these days? I said that as a matter of fact I was myself a Jew. Silence. Then the younger of the two said: \"He was so sweet; how could the Jews do it to him?\" There was such piercing pain and sadness in her voice that I wanted to tell her that it wasn't me - I just happened to have had a dentist's appointment on that particular Friday. Suddenly, perhaps for the first time in my life, this Israeli-born Jew got a sense of what my aunts and my grandmother were not talking about. </p> <p>And yet, the more I read about Jesus, the more I agreed with that nun on one thing at least: he was indeed sweet. That his name evokes such bitterness in members of my family, indeed in millions of Jews, has to do with his disciples, not with him. First and foremost, it has to do with the Catholic Church which for centuries portrayed the Jews as God-killers. How awesome and how gruesome the Jews must have seemed to generations of simple Christian believers: people who could and who would kill a God must be both more and less than human. </p> <p>But my Jesus is neither. He is entirely human. As Pope John Paul II goes to Nazareth and to Bethlehem, to the Sea of Galilee and to Jerusalem, he will be travelling in the footsteps of one of the most genuine Jews who ever lived. I often call him Rabbi Jesus. Some of my Jewish friends as well as some of my Christian friends are uncomfortable with this title, yet Jesus's original followers often called him just that: \"rabbi\" - a Hebrew word that does not mean \"father\" or \"prophet\" or \"holy\", but simply \"teacher\". And a teacher he was; a non-orthodox Jewish teacher who wanted to take Judaism back to what he regarded as its pure origins, or forward towards what he regarded as its uncompromising consequences. Needless to say, he was no Christian: he taught and argued in many synagogues but could never have set foot in a church, nor ever crossed himself or kneeled before any cross, or icon or image, not once in his life. In modern-day terminol ogy, he lived as a reforming Jew and died as a non-conforming Jew. </p> <p>I often wonder how Rabbi Jesus would have felt inside a cathedral or amidst earthly manifestations of Catholic might. I wonder how this blunt, ironic, barefoot, young Galilean poet would view the Vicar of Christ if he met him travelling these days across Galilee with his majestic retinue, surrounded by thousands of armed Jewish guards. Would Jesus regard himself as one of the guests? Or as one of the hosts? Would he be among the cheering crowds? Fall on his knees? Would the pontiff's visit to Galilee make him feel more like my aunts and grandmother or more like those French nuns? </p> <p>Although every Christian calls him Saviour, to me he is simply Yeshu Jesus - son of Miriam and Yosef, who was absolutely right about the rigidity and the hypocrisy of organised religion, for instance, as well as about the universal need for compassion. </p> <p>For centuries, the Jews have been on the receiving end of Christian love. They have been constantly told they must change. They have to love Jesus whether they love him or not. Since the Jews have usually had trouble loving Jesus, Spanish inquisitors or Christian pogrom makers, next-door anti-semites were always there to assist them in finding love. \"The conversion of the Jews\", in the vocabulary of the Church, has become synonymous with the Second Coming, and with the salvation of the world. By stubbornly rejecting Jesus and refusing to convert, the Jews have made themselves guilty of postponing Redemption, thus prolonging the suffering in the world. Therefore they belong on the cross. </p> <p>This, of course, is not a summation of the entire Jewish-Catholic history. There have been bad times and worse times. In the 20th century came the lowest point in this relationship, at least since the days of the Spanish Inquisition, when Pope Pius XII failed to condemn unambiguously the mass murder of the Jews by the Nazi Germans, and refrained from calling upon his flocks to shelter the hunted Jews. On January 15 1964, Pope Paul VI came to visit the Holy Land. From the Jordanian West Bank, he crossed the next day into Israel and spent a few hours there, frequenting holy sites but never once mentioning the term \"Israel\". He was cautious not to say \"Jews\" either, but insisted on the term \"the children of the Covenant of Abraham\". </p> <p>He made it very clear that he had come for a pilgrimage, not for a visit. Concluding his stay with a mass on Mount Zion, he avoided Yad Va'Shem, Israel's national Holocaust museum and memorial, and every other site with Jewish religious or national significance. In his farewell speech, as he was about to leave the country that he refused to mention by name, Paul VI nevertheless praised his mentor, Pope Pius XII, defending Pius's silence during the Holocaust. </p> <p>After returning to the Vatican, he sent a polite telegram addressed to \"President Shazar, Tel Aviv\", evading not only the word Israeli but even any reference to Jerusalem as its capital city (de facto), thus adding insult to injury: even as recently as the 1960s, the Vatican treated Israel as a non-country, its people as a non-nation, and its government as a nonentity. Rabbi Jesus might have regarded such haughty papal conduct as Pharisean. </p> <p>Much has changed since that unfortunate previous pontifical journey to the Holy Land. Even earlier, an initial breakthrough in relations between the Catholic Church and the Jewish people was accomplished by Pope John XXIII who acquitted the Jews of collective responsibility for the killing of Jesus. There followed a gradual, hesitant beginning of Church-sponsored Jewish-Catholic dialogue that eventually led to an official apology by the Catholic Church for its part in the historic ordeal of the Jews. Pope John Paul II is the living spirit behind the various reconciliatory steps that culminated the estab lishment of full diplomatic relations between Israel and the Vatican. </p> <p>However, my one aunt who is still alive (though very old now) is not quite satisfied. She maintains that an apology is not enough, that the Catholic Church - and the Christian world in general - has yet to do some serious soul-searching and self-criticism about their historic treatment of the Jews. In her view, the least the Christians can do now to atone for their many sins toward the Jews is to side with Israel in its dispute with the Arabs. </p> <p>I suspect that what my aunt really wants from the Pope is something that even Jesus could not supply: a river of unconditional love which she thinks the Christians owe the State of Israel and every single Jew. She wants the Pope and every other Christian to want Jerusalem to be full of Jews. After what the Church has inflicted on the Jews for thousands of years, my aunt will settle for nothing short of a Zionist Pope. </p> <p>The Arabs, on the other hand, want him entirely on their side. They expect the Church and the whole of Christendom to see things their way. Moreover, various Arab publications often portray the Jews as the com mon enemy of both Christianity and Islam. In fact, some of the ugliest anti-Jewish Islamic manifestations are borrowed word for word from the vast arsenal of centuries-old Christian anti-semitism. </p> <p>As Pope John Paul travels the Holy Land, through those parts which are the State of Israel and those that will soon become the State of Palestine, he might do well to turn his trip into more than just another pilgrimage to holy sites. He could turn it into an emotionally significant visit with two nations, Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs, deeply injured not only - and not primarily - by each other, but first and foremost by Christian Europe. </p> <p>Perhaps the Pope's prime message during this visit could be addressed not to Jews or Muslims but to Christians: Christian Europe bears a long-standing responsibility for much of the suffering of both conflicting parties in the Middle East. It is therefore the moral duty of Europe to sponsor peace in the Middle East by assisting all parties in every way possible. Rather than constantly taking sides, wagging their fingers like an old-fashioned schoolmaster chastising an unruly pupil, it is time for the people of Europe to give all parties every possible form of moral and material support in their current attempt to reach a compromise solution that is destined to be painful and frustrating for everyone involved. It is no longer necessary for anyone outside the region to choose between being pro-Israeli or pro-Palestinian; it is now possible to be pro-peace by empathising with both. </p> <p>When I was a small child, my wise grandmother explained to me in simple terms the difference between Jew and Christian (but her words of wisdom could well apply to any religious differences). \"You see,\" she said, \"the Christians believe that the Messiah has been here once and will one day return; the Jews maintain that the Messiah has yet to come. Over this, there has been endless hatred and bloodshed. Why? Why can't everybody simply wait and see? If the Messiah comes saying, 'Hello, it's nice to see you again,' then the Jews will have to concede. If, on the other hand, he comes saying, 'How do you do?' then the entire Christian world will have to apologise to the Jews. Until that time, why not just live and let live?\" </p> <p>\"Forgive them,\" said Rabbi Jesus, \"for they know not what they are doing.\" Well, I would go along with Christian wisdom about forgiveness, but not with the \"know not\" bit. Even as we ought to try to forgive one another for various past injustices, we should not do so on the grounds of moral infantility or ethical imbecility. We all know what we are doing whenever we inflict pain, cause humiliation or give offence, because at one time or another we all have been at the receiving end. </p> <p>\u00a9 Amos Oz 2000.

Even earlier, an initial breakthrough in relations between the Catholic Church and the Jewish people was accomplished by Pope John XXIII who acquitted the Jews of collective responsibility for the killing of Jesus. There followed a gradual, hesitant beginning of Church-sponsored Jewish-Catholic dialogue that eventually led to an official apology by the Catholic Church for its part in the historic ordeal of the Jews. Pope John Paul II is the living spirit behind the various reconciliatory steps that culminated the estab lishment of full diplomatic relations between Israel and the Vatican. However, my one aunt who is still alive (though very old now) is not quite satisfied. She maintains that an apology is not enough, that the Catholic Church - and the Christian world in general - has yet to do some serious soul-searching and self-criticism about their historic treatment of the Jews. In her view, the least the Christians can do now to atone for their many sins toward the Jews is to side with Israel in its dispute with the Arabs. I suspect that what my aunt really wants from the Pope is something that even Jesus could not supply: a river of unconditional love which she thinks the Christians owe the State of Israel and every single Jew. She wants the Pope and every other Christian to want Jerusalem to be full of Jews. After what the Church has inflicted on the Jews for thousands of years, my aunt will settle for nothing short of a Zionist Pope. The Arabs, on the other hand, want him entirely on their side. They expect the Church and the whole of Christendom to see things their way. Moreover, various Arab publications often portray the Jews as the com mon enemy of both Christianity and Islam. In fact, some of the ugliest anti-Jewish Islamic manifestations are borrowed word for word from the vast arsenal of centuries-old Christian anti-semitism. As Pope John Paul travels the Holy Land, through those parts which are the State of Israel and those that will soon become the State of Palestine, he might do well to turn his trip into more than just another pilgrimage to holy sites. He could turn it into an emotionally significant visit with two nations, Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs, deeply injured not only - and not primarily - by each other, but first and foremost by Christian Europe. Perhaps the Pope's prime message during this visit could be addressed not to Jews or Muslims but to Christians: Christian Europe bears a long-standing responsibility for much of the suffering of both conflicting parties in the Middle East. It is therefore the moral duty of Europe to sponsor peace in the Middle East by assisting all parties in every way possible. Rather than constantly taking sides, wagging their fingers like an old-fashioned schoolmaster chastising an unruly pupil, it is time for the people of Europe to give all parties every possible form of moral and material support in their current attempt to reach a compromise solution that is destined to be painful and frustrating for everyone involved. It is no longer necessary for anyone outside the region to choose between being pro-Israeli or pro-Palestinian; it is now possible to be pro-peace by empathising with both. When I was a small child, my wise grandmother explained to me in simple terms the difference between Jew and Christian (but her words of wisdom could well apply to any religious differences). \"You see,\" she said, \"the Christians believe that the Messiah has been here once and will one day return; the Jews maintain that the Messiah has yet to come. Over this, there has been endless hatred and bloodshed. Why? Why can't everybody simply wait and see? If the Messiah comes saying, 'Hello, it's nice to see you again,' then the Jews will have to concede. If, on the other hand, he comes saying, 'How do you do?' then the entire Christian world will have to apologise to the Jews. Until that time, why not just live and let live?\" \"Forgive them,\" said Rabbi Jesus, \"for they know not what they are doing.\" Well, I would go along with Christian wisdom about forgiveness, but not with the \"know not\" bit. Even as we ought to try to forgive one another for various past injustices, we should not do so on the grounds of moral infantility or ethical imbecility. We all know what we are doing whenever we inflict pain, cause humiliation or give offence, because at one time or another we all have been at the receiving end. \u00a9 Amos Oz 2000.

This process, acknowledged by the chief inspector, is being driven forward by the new governor.\"",

      "bodyText": "Passengers travelling from France to Britain on Eurostar are to be checked at French railway stations by British immigration officials as part of the government's crackdown on bogus asylum seekers, the Home Office said last night. The measures are being introduced to deter illegal immigrants from using the high-speed Paris to London rail service under a new Anglo-French agreement, the home secretary Jack Straw said. The government faces renewed controversy over its stance on immigrants, and the Foreign Office minister Peter Hain denied it was pandering to racism in its response to begging asylum seekers. He told BBC radio: \"Everybody understands that this tiny minority of asylum seekers who are taking their children on the streets in this way, when they have benefit enti tlements... are actually giving asylum seekers a bad name. \"If we sought to duck that, then I think the credibility of the British tradition of welcoming genuine refugees from political and other forms of repression would have been strained at the edge.\" The new Eurostar controls mean that British immigration officers will carry out checks at French rail stations on passengers travelling to Britain, and French officers will operate similar controls at Waterloo station in London and at Ashford International station in Kent. French police will also be able to remove inadequately documented travellers from Eurostar trains. The controls are similar to those which already exist for vehicle passengers using the channel tunnel. Asylum applications made at Waterloo, London's Eurostar terminal, increased from 3,997 in 1998 to 5,902 in 1999 - a jump of 46%. Mr Straw said: \"Recently, the Eurostar route has been the target for illegal immigrants and those who facilitate this traffic. This agreement is a powerful message to these people.\" The government hopes that a combination of \"voluntary detention\" and swift decision-making will deter economic migrants from coming to Britain in the first place. A fast-track centre for processing people suspected of lodging false asylum claims opened in Oakington, Cambridgeshire, yesterday. Seven people were arrested for alleged obstruction outside the gates of the former RAF base in protest at the \"voluntary detention\" system.",

In all of the three areas of the market he investigated - including money transmission, personal services (like current accounts, mortgages and credit cards) and services to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) - he found that competition was ineffective. A few large banks were found to dominate the market for personal services to ordinary customers and SMEs. Many customers were unaware of even basic details of financial services, many of which were sold off the back of current accounts, the market for which was dominated by a few large firms squeezing monopolistic profits out of their privileged position. Cruickshank said that in 1998 three UK banks each made more profit than the five major quoted supermarket companies (which have themselves been accused of profiteering in the past).</p> <p>His startling conclusion is that personal and small business customers are being ripped off to the tune of \u00a33bn to \u00a35bn a year - or between \u00a340 and \u00a3400 for most households. This turns the whole thing into a macro-economic problem as well as a moral one. Since he is saying that the banks are overcharging by that amount, then clearly the malpractices should be ended. If they were stopped, then the equivalent of a cut of up to 2p in the pound in income tax would be delivered - with similar effects on the economy in terms of increased spending power. If, in addition, the banks had to pay back some of their excess profits from previous years, then the boost to consumer spending power would almost certainly be enough to overheat the economy to such an extent that the Bank of England would be forced to put interest rates up even more.</p> <p>Is there an alternative? The chancellor, Gordon Brown, would be less than human if his thoughts did not stray to the possibility of levying a one-off surcharge on the banks: a kind of bankers' windfall tax. This would purge them of their guilt while, at the same time, resolving the central dilemma of Brown's budget: he needs to spend much more money on health and education to satisfy public expectations but cannot do it without raising taxes. Otherwise it could lead to economic overheating and higher interest rates.</p> <p>But if the spending were financed by a comparable levy on the banks' profits (anything up to \u00a35bn), then it could be done without loosening the chancellor's fiscal stance - the balance between taxes, spending and borrowing. This may sound like an (interventionist) Old Labour solution, but it is not. It is not a question of grabbing profits unjustifiably but of restoring to consumers money taken away by the abuse of a monopoly position. New Labour has already levied a windfall charge on the utilities to finance the government's New Deal. It proved very popular with the public and did not seem to do much damage to the utilities. The Conservatives would complain about stealth taxes - but should first remind themselves of their own budget in 1981 which contained a once-and-for-all charge of \u00a3400m (worth much more at today's prices) on the banks on the grounds that they had been doing much better than everybody else during a bad period for the economy as a whole.

This is not the case. Councils, which are often blamed by the DfEE for failing schools, have no substantive power to intervene or, except where a school is in special measures, to direct additional resources to it. They cannot even insist that the school budget is spent on teaching. Local authorities, whose role is heavily circumscribed, would welcome being given the freedom and flexibility which are to be extended to unaccountable private-sector operators.</p> <p>The latest proposals are likely further to fragment the education service and distance schools from their communities and the local services with which they should connect. What is needed to raise standards and to ensure sustained improvement is an effective partnership between local councils, schools, central government, the private and the voluntary sectors. What we appear to be moving inexorably towards is an education service controlled from London by the DfEE and increasingly administered through bodies appointed by and accountable to the Secretary of State. In the long term this will prove unworkable and undermines the very local democracy which, through its modernisation programme, the government seeks to enhance.<br><b>Cllr Sir Jeremy Beecham </b><br>Local Government Association</p> <p>\u0095 The only factor that makes private education remotely compatible with the aims of public sector education is the existence of a private school such as Summerhill ('Free and Easy' Summerhill goes on trial, March 20) that does not seek an unfair competitive advantage for its children, but hopes simply to turn them into better and happier citizens.

      "bodyText": "In welcoming David Blunkett's announcement of city academies - made without consultation with councils or the Local Government Association - you imply (Leader, March 16) that most schools are controlled by local education authorities. This is not the case. Councils, which are often blamed by the DfEE for failing schools, have no substantive power to intervene or, except where a school is in special measures, to direct additional resources to it. They cannot even insist that the school budget is spent on teaching. Local authorities, whose role is heavily circumscribed, would welcome being given the freedom and flexibility which are to be extended to unaccountable private-sector operators. The latest proposals are likely further to fragment the education service and distance schools from their communities and the local services with which they should connect. What is needed to raise standards and to ensure sustained improvement is an effective partnership between local councils, schools, central government, the private and the voluntary sectors. What we appear to be moving inexorably towards is an education service controlled from London by the DfEE and increasingly administered through bodies appointed by and accountable to the Secretary of State. In the long term this will prove unworkable and undermines the very local democracy which, through its modernisation programme, the government seeks to enhance. Cllr Sir Jeremy Beecham Local Government Association \u0095 The only factor that makes private education remotely compatible with the aims of public sector education is the existence of a private school such as Summerhill ('Free and Easy' Summerhill goes on trial, March 20) that does not seek an unfair competitive advantage for its children, but hopes simply to turn them into better and happier citizens. And now Blunkett and Woodhead want to close it. Robert Brook Shrewsbury \u0095 So money is judged to be an effective persuader (\u00a340 a week to stay at school, March 20). But university students are charged \u00a31,000 a year to study. Does this imply that the government is trying to persuade fewer people to go? Revd Dr John Ogden Reading, Berks",

      "body": "<p>Nasr Mazi, a farmer who grows dates and vegetables near the Euphrates river, went back into hospital yesterday to have shrapnel removed from his back, one of the latest victims of Britain and America's almost forgotten war along the Iraqi border.</p> <p>Mr Mazi lives on the frontline, in an area that has been under siege for almost 10 years. The British and US governments say their argument is with President Saddam Hussein, not the Iraqi people. Mr Mazi would disagree.</p> <p>His village, Al-Fade, near the town of Simawa, is quiet and poor, with a few idyllic touches such as the date palms that provide shade and colour in an otherwise desert area. Ducks, sheep, donkeys and children wander along the alleyways.</p> <p>Sitting crosslegged in his courtyard Mr Mazi, who is 53 but looks much older from his days labouring in the hot sun, described how on March 10 he had followed his usual routine. \"I watered the summer vegetables in the morning, went home for lunch and was walking back to the vegetables. There was a croak-croak. It was the planes. I was not worried. I heard them every day, near and far.\"</p> <p>A minute later, he was knocked unconscious. The village had been attacked. The Iraqis blamed the US and British. Seven missiles were fired. Although only two exploded, they were enough to slice down rows of 100-year-old date trees, kill 10 sheep and a donkey, and injure six people.</p> <p><b> Easy targets</b><br></p> <p>One of those injured with Mr Mazi was Fadi Thamir, 35. Standing amid the fallen trees and the huge holes left in the ground by the missiles, Mr Thamir, also a farmer, said: \"God save us: if it had gone off a little closer, we would have been killed. First came a humming, then a big explosion, and my hearing went. Fragments were flying all over. There was smoke. Bits of animals were flying up and down.\"</p> <p>They were taken to hospital but Mr Thamir, suffering only superficial wounds, was allowed home quickly and helped clear up. \"We fed the sheep and donkey to the dogs. Only the donkey's head is left,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Mazi was kept in, but allowed home for the weekend because it was a Muslim holiday. He was still in obvious pain as he stripped off his gown to show the puncture wounds from the shrapnel. He sent one of his two wives, Jamah Hatchem, into the house to bring out x-rays the hospital had allowed him to take home. He pointed proudly to the bits of metal embedded in his body.</p> <p>When asked if he was angry with the US and Britain, he smiled. But his wife was outraged on his behalf. She had been in a room with her two children when the blast shook the house. \"Why cannot the Iraqis have peace after all this time?\" she asked.</p> <p>The ancient villages and towns that line the Euphrates receive US and British sorties daily. It is the first populated area of Iraq to be reached by pilots flying north from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The number of attacks is disputed, with the west claiming no more than a handful of bombings this year and the Iraqis claiming there are casualties every week.</p> <p>A thorough look round the village showed nothing that could remotely have a military purpose. But the most likely targets of the recent attack were Sam missile launchers, which the Allies claim the Iraqis deliberately set up in civilian areas. Mr Thamir was adamant there were none: \"How can you get anything military up that road? It is not good enough,\" he said.</p> <p>There is no way of proving either way. He did, however, have some evidence from the attack. He put out a call and villagers went off to gather bits of missiles. One had a fragment which had the maker's serial number on it. Some of the letters and numbers were missing but what could be read clearly was \"Product of roe auto 20 19350\".</p> <p>This stretch of Iraq - over which the US and Britain imposed a no-fly zone, saying it was necessary to protect dissident Shia Muslims opposed to President Saddam - is the hardest-hit of the conflict. It includes Basra in the east, and two big towns to the west - Nasiriya and Simawa - all of them desperate-looking.</p> <p>Almost 10 years of bombing and economic sanctions have taken an enormous toll. Food is rationed, as is electricity. The whole place smells because the sewage system has virtually collapsed. Diseases that had been eradicated have returned. The cars are even more clapped-out than in Baghdad, with few newer than 1990, the year sanctions were imposed by the west.</p> <p>Almost everyone in Iraq has to cope with sanctions but what makes life harder in the no-fly zone is that it was these towns that were subjected to the full onslaught of the Allied air attacks in 1991. The destruction remains much as it did then. Only half of Victory bridge over the Euphrates at Nasiriya remains and that is a mangled mess of light-green metal, pointing skywards. The bridge over the Euphrates at Simawa is still to be rebuilt, as is the electricity power station and much else of the infrastructure.</p> <p>That first wave of bombing has left people psychologically scarred. They are constantly on edge in a way they are not in Baghdad. Amir Doshi, who teaches English to schoolchildren in Nasiriya, showing off his English, described life on the frontline as \"a black comedy\". But he was not laughing much. Driving along the Eu phrates, he reels off again and again the exact minute and date that each bridge was bombed and the number of people killed. At the point where the bridge over the Euphrates at Simawa used to be, he said: \"Three-forty pm, 10th of February.\"</p> <p>Mr Doshi is not unique.

      "bodyText": "Nasr Mazi, a farmer who grows dates and vegetables near the Euphrates river, went back into hospital yesterday to have shrapnel removed from his back, one of the latest victims of Britain and America's almost forgotten war along the Iraqi border. Mr Mazi lives on the frontline, in an area that has been under siege for almost 10 years. The British and US governments say their argument is with President Saddam Hussein, not the Iraqi people. Mr Mazi would disagree. His village, Al-Fade, near the town of Simawa, is quiet and poor, with a few idyllic touches such as the date palms that provide shade and colour in an otherwise desert area. Ducks, sheep, donkeys and children wander along the alleyways. Sitting crosslegged in his courtyard Mr Mazi, who is 53 but looks much older from his days labouring in the hot sun, described how on March 10 he had followed his usual routine. \"I watered the summer vegetables in the morning, went home for lunch and was walking back to the vegetables. There was a croak-croak. It was the planes. I was not worried. I heard them every day, near and far.\" A minute later, he was knocked unconscious. The village had been attacked. The Iraqis blamed the US and British. Seven missiles were fired. Although only two exploded, they were enough to slice down rows of 100-year-old date trees, kill 10 sheep and a donkey, and injure six people. Easy targets One of those injured with Mr Mazi was Fadi Thamir, 35. Standing amid the fallen trees and the huge holes left in the ground by the missiles, Mr Thamir, also a farmer, said: \"God save us: if it had gone off a little closer, we would have been killed. First came a humming, then a big explosion, and my hearing went. Fragments were flying all over. There was smoke. Bits of animals were flying up and down.\" They were taken to hospital but Mr Thamir, suffering only superficial wounds, was allowed home quickly and helped clear up. \"We fed the sheep and donkey to the dogs. Only the donkey's head is left,\" he said. Mr Mazi was kept in, but allowed home for the weekend because it was a Muslim holiday. He was still in obvious pain as he stripped off his gown to show the puncture wounds from the shrapnel. He sent one of his two wives, Jamah Hatchem, into the house to bring out x-rays the hospital had allowed him to take home. He pointed proudly to the bits of metal embedded in his body. When asked if he was angry with the US and Britain, he smiled. But his wife was outraged on his behalf. She had been in a room with her two children when the blast shook the house. \"Why cannot the Iraqis have peace after all this time?\" she asked. The ancient villages and towns that line the Euphrates receive US and British sorties daily. It is the first populated area of Iraq to be reached by pilots flying north from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The number of attacks is disputed, with the west claiming no more than a handful of bombings this year and the Iraqis claiming there are casualties every week. A thorough look round the village showed nothing that could remotely have a military purpose. But the most likely targets of the recent attack were Sam missile launchers, which the Allies claim the Iraqis deliberately set up in civilian areas. Mr Thamir was adamant there were none: \"How can you get anything military up that road? It is not good enough,\" he said. There is no way of proving either way. He did, however, have some evidence from the attack. He put out a call and villagers went off to gather bits of missiles. One had a fragment which had the maker's serial number on it. Some of the letters and numbers were missing but what could be read clearly was \"Product of roe auto 20 19350\". This stretch of Iraq - over which the US and Britain imposed a no-fly zone, saying it was necessary to protect dissident Shia Muslims opposed to President Saddam - is the hardest-hit of the conflict. It includes Basra in the east, and two big towns to the west - Nasiriya and Simawa - all of them desperate-looking. Almost 10 years of bombing and economic sanctions have taken an enormous toll. Food is rationed, as is electricity. The whole place smells because the sewage system has virtually collapsed. Diseases that had been eradicated have returned. The cars are even more clapped-out than in Baghdad, with few newer than 1990, the year sanctions were imposed by the west. Almost everyone in Iraq has to cope with sanctions but what makes life harder in the no-fly zone is that it was these towns that were subjected to the full onslaught of the Allied air attacks in 1991. The destruction remains much as it did then. Only half of Victory bridge over the Euphrates at Nasiriya remains and that is a mangled mess of light-green metal, pointing skywards. The bridge over the Euphrates at Simawa is still to be rebuilt, as is the electricity power station and much else of the infrastructure. That first wave of bombing has left people psychologically scarred. They are constantly on edge in a way they are not in Baghdad. Amir Doshi, who teaches English to schoolchildren in Nasiriya, showing off his English, described life on the frontline as \"a black comedy\". But he was not laughing much. Driving along the Eu phrates, he reels off again and again the exact minute and date that each bridge was bombed and the number of people killed. At the point where the bridge over the Euphrates at Simawa used to be, he said: \"Three-forty pm, 10th of February.\" Mr Doshi is not unique. Council officials, doctors and others in the area, who struggled to recall events that had taken place only weeks or months previously, could speak in detail about 1991. There are other legacies of the Gulf war. Uranium-depleted shells used by the Allies are strewn around. The British and Americans insist they are harmless, but the Iraqis say the uranium has seeped into the ground, presenting a severe health hazard. And there are mines all over the area, which the Iraqis say were dropped by the Allies. A doctor at Saddam hospital in Nasiriya said that every day brought casualties of the mines, many of them children. In one of the wards, Falh Mhil, a 15-year-old shepherd boy, lay covered in bandages. The bedlinen was filthy and the bed stank. Detergent is in short supply in Iraq, as well as medicines, both controlled by UN sanctions. Taking sheep from his home at Al-nasr, about 37 miles (60km) north of Nasiriya, about a fortnight ago, Falh had seen his brothers, Abdullah, seven, and Faris, 10, throwing something to and fro. \"It was bright red, the shape of a glass of water,\" he said. He was familiar with mines because there were so many in the area, but had not seen this type before. \"My brother had taken the pin out and I tried to put it back. I fell down. It felt like a storm.\" He lost a hand and the sight in one eye. In another ward was Adeba Ali, 13, a beautiful, dark-haired girl, a shepherdess.

      "body": "<p>Eleanor is nearly seven but she looks young for her age. I watch her skating around her parents' living room in her party frock. She's not sure who I am - I'm trying to make my visit informal, though I'm a little tense - but she's clearly dressed to impress. \"So, Eleanor,\" her mother says, trying to hold her attention, \"are you enjoying your SAT tests?\"</p> <p>She asks this for me because, back in 1996, the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority commissioned an evaluation of Standard Assessment Tasks (SATs), in which 11-year-olds showed \"a high level of acceptance of the 1996 tests\". As many as half said they enjoyed them. </p> <p>Children of Eleanor's age are not thought to be stressed by SAT testing. The general view seems to be that, at six or seven, they're not very aware of what's going on and so SATs don't bother them much. But Eleanor is no fool. According to her mother, she has picked up on preoccupations at school about the level 2 target. And given how acutely aware she is of my presence, she's bound to notice when a supply teacher comes in to test her because her own class teacher is busy teaching another group. </p> <p>Though she won't admit to any of this while I'm around; Eleanor steals one of her quick glances at me and declares loudly that yes, she's enjoying SATs. Her skating intensifies. Her mother raises an eyebrow at me. \"And what are your teachers telling you to do?\" \"Be TIDY!\" she shouts, stamping round the furniture. </p> <p>Elaine Joyce of Tolworth Infants School in Kingston acknowledges that, unless handled sensitively, children can be stressed by the tests: \"We tell parents it's important that their children have a good night's sleep and come to school, without giving the impression that SATs are the be-all and end-all.\" She pauses. \"Though they may be for schools.\" </p> <p>Certainly, tensions are rising now that teachers' pay is to be related to performance. Joyce agrees that where such tensions exist, children pick up on them, no matter how hard schools work to put them at their ease. It's true that the harder I try to make my interview with Eleanor informal, the more agitated she becomes. </p> <p>I turn to Eleanor's 10-year-old sister, who is sitting quietly on the armrest of her mother's chair. Her sister's play irritates her. She tells me the tests are boring. She used to play herself - the piano - but she hasn't got time any more, because, being a promising child, she's been handpicked for government-funded level 4 SAT practice. This means she now works in her free time. </p> <p>I dimly recall the theory behind SAT testing, in the days before estate agents started filling and emptying schools by displaying school league tables. And before the education secretary, David Blunkett, guaranteed that by 2001, 80% of key stage 2 pupils would reach level 4 in English (excepting pupils with special needs, who somehow don't count). Wasn't the theory something along the lines that SATs were \"on the spot\" tests? </p> <p>The practice is somewhat different now: parent meetings organised to warn of oncoming tests; SAT predictions allegedly raised artificially year on year to satisfy Ofsted (regardless of the fact that results vary according to pupil intake and staff changes); rivalry between some teachers for best SAT scores, since no one exactly knows how else performance pay will be worked out; extra coaching to improve statistics; classwork, sometimes a year early, consisting mainly of SAT papers, and priority given to English, maths and science; scores benchmarked against test levels. </p> <p>In this fearful climate, many parents worry about their children's grades, which is why the shelves of WH Smith are stacked with SAT booklets. SAT websites, like those provided by Freeserve and the BBC, receive anxious emails like, \"My son is only getting level 3 in class work: how do you think he will perform come May?\" Some schools even sell SAT papers to parents. Heads like Elaine Joyce abhor this practice, since it reinforces the idea that children should prepare for SATs. </p> <p>And why should they? What exactly do children get out of all that hard work? Good SAT results benefit the government. They may even be an asset to certain schools and teachers. But apart from being streamed into different ability groups on government advice that \"setting should be the norm in secondary schools\", children's SAT results make no difference to their academic careers. </p> <p>Raised standards in schools? Don't count on it. There's a world of difference between true learning and the parrot learning that enables children to score highly in SATs. The reason Tony Blair wisely said \"education, education, education,\" not \"tests, tests, tests\" is that cramming and education are two different things - diametrically opposed, some would argue. </p> <p>As Piaget, Neill, Montessori and other educators have pointed out, every time you tell a child about the world, you steal the thrill of discovery that is the key to an investigative mind. </p> <p>No thrills for Adam, who at 13 must do his homework again tonight because it only scored 5B and he must get level 6. His results are pinned on the classroom wall, to humiliate him into working. In assembly, he is reminded of the need to maintain his school's high place in the league tables. He doesn't care about Shakespeare, or about why you spell \"excited\" with a c. He's feeling sick, and he's getting headaches and diarrhoea. </p> <p>I have taught many pupils who were made to take exams too seriously. As Oliver James, author of Britain on the Couch, points out, today even children who are \"winners\" usually feel like \"losers\". And if, in the long run, the terror of not making the grade doesn't put them off their learning altogether, or make them ill, it usually makes them underperform, because fear restricts their thinking. </p> <p>And yet. We have research that tells us children who do only occasional homework perform better than swots. The example of countries such as Denmark proves that children can do perfectly well starting school as late as seven. We have research that tells us good schools can improve pupils' performance a little, but not much, because psycho-social factors largely shape academic ability. </p> <p>We have research that tells us that streaming doesn't improve grades and dampens children's morale. We have research that tells us children's minds develop through music and free play. We have research that tells us humans underperform when they are stressed. And we all know that teenagers rebel when they are sick of being ordered around. </p> <p>But maybe a stressed education department finds it hard to take in all these findings. It's easier to fall for the attraction of crude policies, to prove to a demanding electorate that the government is making a tangible effort to raise standards in schools. So Blunkett introduces a blinkered, zero-tolerance, dare I say totalitarian regime, and simply tightens his grip on local education authorities, schools, teachers and, last of all, our children. The stress simply gets pushed down the rungs of the ladder. </p> <p>As Chris Woodhead, chief inspector of schools, praises rising standards and proposes further testing in schools, Eleanor had better watch out. Her skating days are numbered. </p> <p><strong>To keep your child calm</strong></p> <p><strong> Do</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Keep SATs in perspective. They don't raise or lower your child's prospects: the results won't affect your child's transition to secondary school, and schools that stream children will tend not to do so on the basis of SAT results. </p> <p>\u0095 Be aware that your child may be picking up on a certain amount of stress at school, if staff are tense or if classmates panic. Headaches, tiredness, feeling sick, not wanting to go to school or behaving disruptively are some ways in which children express frustration and anxiety. </p> <p>\u0095 Talk with your child if he or she seems worried. Some anxiety is normal and can usually be overcome by talking about it. Help young children express their feelings by naming them (eg \"you sound angry/worried/scared\"). This is much more helpful than saying, \"Don't worry\". </p> <p>\u0095 Encourage your child to look upon these tests as nothing more than exam practice. </p> <p><strong> Don't</strong> </p> <p>\u0095 Make an issue of your child's SATs. Unlike GCSE and A levels, they can't be failed: they exist simply to measure standards in schools. </p> <p>\u0095 Put pressure on your child to achieve a certain level. SATs are designed to be \"on the spot\" tests - despite the fact that many schools try to prepare children for them. </p> <p>\u0095 Set too much store by the outcome of your child's SATs. Academic progress rarely follows a steady course: some children's work only matures in late adolescence, so SAT results don't necessarily predict future ability.<br></p> <p> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.eileentracy.co.uk\">Eileen Tracy</a> is a study skills counsellor and lecturer.

The prize for the best eight to 10 writers will be published in an anthology next autumn. This year's collection, The Perfect Love Story?, has already attracted favourable comment from Andrew Motion, Poet Laureate, so it is an ideal way for an aspiring writer to get noticed. The journey does not have to be a holiday or even geographical at all - journeys of the mind, through time or of self-discovery are all welcome and the treatment is up to you - factual, funny, satirical or romantic. Make your story clear, on one side of the paper only - preferably typewritten. And remember to keep a copy, as manuscripts will not be returned. Only one entry per person. Length: no more than 3,000 words; deadline: April 30. Entries should be sent to: The Guardian/Piccadilly Press Writing Competition for Teenagers, 5 Castle Road, London NW1 8PR. The judges' decision is final and no correspondence will be entered into. All published manuscripts are edited. The competition is open to all residents of the UK and Eire between 13 and 18 years of age, except previous winners and employees of the Guardian or Piccadilly Press and their relatives. Entry grants to Piccadilly Press Ltd the exclusive right to publish an entrant's story in all formats throughout the world for the full legal term of copyright.

In serious trouble and heading for a critical Ofsted inspection, it has been turned round in partnership with a successful neighbour under a Church of England foundation. Could it be a blueprint for the kind of school the education and employment secretary has called on the churches, charities and businesses to set up and run in the inner cities and make them succeed where local authorities had failed?</p> <p>As with most stories in education the truth is more complicated - the local authority played a big part, for a start - and it shows the government's \"fresh start\" policy in a less than flattering light. (That policy was rocked last week by the resignation of three high-profile \"superheads\".) </p> <p>Four years ago Regis School, as it was then called, was in deep trouble. In the 70s, Regis had been a successful school, but with the coming of grant-maintained schools and parental choice in the 90s, middle-class parents abandoned the school and standards fell. By 1996, Wolverhampton's education department had already tried to support the school without success. An Ofsted inspection was imminent. </p> <p>\"It would have failed by break on the first day,\" says Peter Crook, head of the successful, neighbouring St Peters Collegiate School who was approached to become interim headteacher of Regis. The situation in the school was dire. Teachers came and went. One child had 13 maths teachers in her GCSE year. Attendance was 70% and truancy endemic. Local shopkeepers would make anguished calls to the school complaining about Regis pupils and demanding to know what was going on. The school's corridors teemed with children who had been thrown out of lessons or who had simply never turned up to where they were supposed to be. </p> <p>Wolverhampton had run out of options. They approached Crook, whose school had been identified as one of the top comprehensives in the country, and asked him to take over Regis - to run it as a single, split-site school. </p> <p>\"I said no - it wasn't an attractive concept.\" What Crook would do was run the schools in partnership, under a Church of England foundation that would oversee both schools. </p> <p>He was seconded in November 1996. What struck him forcibly on that first contact was the atmosphere of despair and defeat. One child said to him \"I know why you're here - it's because we're rubbish.\" Asked why no one played soccer in the playground, the children told Crook that no one in their right mind brought a soccer ball to the Regis. </p> <p>Throughout the winter, working groups hammered out the details of the new foundation. Lichfield diocese would buy the site and the buildings for \u00a3500,000 whilst the education department contributed \u00a3330,000 for essential health and safety work. Wolverhampton agreed to pass back the \u00a3500,000 to the school and to cover a deficit budget for its first few years of operation. </p> <p>A new head, Tim Gallagher, was appointed a year later and the government declared Kings a fresh start school. The announcement took Crook and Gallagher by surprise. </p> <p>\"We were told we would be part of the fresh start initiative and we thought, 'What's that?' \" Gallagher says. </p> <p>Two years on, and they are still wondering. Attendance is up to 90% and last year's GCSEs saw a pass rate of 35% at grades A-C. There's a new uniform which nearly every child in the school was wearing on the first day and the disruption and chaos that characterised the school in the past has disappeared. In September, the Kings School will become a specialist school - an arts college, reflecting the progress teachers have made. Earlier this month, the foundation travelled down to see the education department. </p> <p>\"We're doing some good here,\" they said. \"We've increased the roll from 570 to nearly 700 in 18 months. What are you doing?\" </p> <p>The answer is not a lot. The school has received no funding specifically targeted at its fresh start problems and essential building works are being delayed by Whitehall bureaucracy. Gallagher had a vision of a faith centre, to reflect the school's new Christian emphasis and the fact that many children come from other faiths. </p> <p>\"There's no sign of it,\" he says, \"because the DfEE are sitting on the plans. We have tenders out, we know who's going to do it - all we want is for the DfEE to say yes. And we've no drama or arts facilities - despite the fact that those are major parts of our arts bid.\" </p> <p>In its first year, the new school plunged \u00a3155,000 into debt, money that will have to be repaid to the local authority. \"Had we been given the resourcing and support that other fresh start schools have received - and I hear figures of \u00a38m for one school being bandied about - we wouldn't have these problems,\" says Gallagher. \"In effect we were given a millstone when we started - not a fresh start.\" </p> <p>Peter Crook is now the principal of the Lichfield Foundation and is evangelical about the concept of allowing schools to work in partnership. </p> <p>\"The notion of one school succeeding at the expense of another is alien to me,\" he says. The Wolverhampton fresh start could serve as a model in other areas and the involvement of the church, business and the local university is precisely the kind of community venture that Blunkett suggested this week. </p> <p>But experience of the new Kings School also points up the fact that resourcing remains at the heart of the problem in many schools, and that solutions require more than a high-profile superhead. Peter Crook believes that a willingness to stay the course is essential. </p> <p>\"When you say 'This is what's going to be happening', parents' first thought is 'How long are you staying? because my child's staying five years'. You've either got the credibility or you haven't. I believe it's about people having faith that you are going to stay with it when it gets rough.\"</p> <p>\u0095 David Blunkett's <a href=\"http://www.dfee.gov.uk/social_market\">speech</a> about city academies - with an oppurtunity to comment.</p>",

You soon realise you need to make friends and try to at least speak the rudiments of another language and eat food made locally. If you are with a large group of people you often find yourself on the equivalent of a viewing platform, looking at it all through plate-glass.\" He was of course going around with a film crew, but they were skilful and discreet, did not set things up in elaborate ways or ask people to do things three or four times. \"You know when you have lost people - they go quiet.\" But the Beeb's reputation does mean something in even the remotest spot, as Palin discovered while researching his Hemingway journey. \"I'm from the BBC.\" Instant recognition. \"Ah yes,\" said the skipper shaking my hand, \"the Bahamas Billfish Championships.\" There was also a back-up team to make the arrangements. But, as Palin records, despite their plans they ended up \"bustling, hurrying, rushing, improvising to get ourselves home only by the skin of our teeth. And that's what made it worth doing. The smoother the journey, the duller it would have been.\"",

      "byline": "Carolyne Culver",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The threat of top-up fees looms large on the horizon for a student movement still reeling from the abolition of the grant and introduction of tuition fees.</p> <p>These issues will be on the agenda at this year's National Union of Students conference, to be held in Blackpool between 3-6 April. For the first time in 18 years, Labour Students are not fielding a candidate for NUS national president, the most powerful and influential position in the 3m-strong union, and one that they have held for almost two decades. </p> <p>Andrew Pakes, the current Labour Students president of the NUS, wants to see Labour Students focusing on building the grassroots of their organisation and winning the next general election for the Labour Party, rather than expending energy onwinning the leadership of the student movement. However, Labour Students are still fielding candidates for four out of six of the full-time NUS positions. Many students believe that fear of defeat is a more likely explanation for Labour Students' decision not to field a candidate for president. </p> <p>The group has been condemned by much of the student movement for the role they played in capitulating to the Labour party's anti-grant policy in the run-up to the 1997 general election. At the time, Labour argued that grants were unrealistic in a fiscally prudent world, and that the NUS should concentrate on preventing the introduction of tuition fees. </p> <p>In reality the NUS gave an inch and the government took a mile, capitalising on the student movement's compromise with the long-held principle of free education to abolish the grant and introduce fees. </p> <p>Labour Students might also be unwilling to lead the NUS now that top-up fees are back on the agenda. Number 10 is sympathetic to calls for the introduction of top-up fees from the Russell group of research universities, and have announced that a higher education funding review will take place in 2002. </p> <p>However, it is likely that the government will allow top-up fees to be introduced in some universities soon after the general election which, if it is held next spring or summer, would put a new Labour Students president in conflict with the Labour government. </p> <p>The next president of the NUS will inherit a divided student movement. From October Scottish students will be enjoying the fruits of devolution, in the form of means-tested bursaries and the replacement of tuition fees with a graduate contribution. Meanwhile, English and Welsh students will continue to be charged tuition fees and rely on loans for their maintenance. The next president of NUS will face pressure to win the Scottish concessions for English and Welsh students. </p> <p>The past two years have seen a rise in direct action, including mass non-payment of fees, occupations and rent strikes. The new president will be under pressure to support such action, particularly if it is endorsed by local students' unions. </p> <p>So who will the new president be? There are three candidates vying for the top job at this year's annual conference. Alison Angus, current NUS Black Students officer, Owain James, current NUS national secretary, and Mark Tweedale, a member of the NUS national executive committee. </p> <p>Whereas previous years have seen an acrimonious fight between Labour Students and the hard left for the presidency, this year the race is likely to be between James, an independent, and Angus, an independent left candidate leading the left's United for Education slate. </p> <p>The politics of the student movement appear to be narrowing. Whereas Labour Students supported the abolition of the grant in 1997, they now advocate its restoration for the poorest students. This brings them closer to the position of the traditional left in the NUS, who support universal grants. </p> <p> All three of this year's presidential candidates advocate the abolition of tuition fees, oppose top-up fees and believe that the minimum wage should be increased to at least \u00a35 per hour for all employees. </p> <p>There is also a shared conviction that the NUS must improve its campaigns and level of student participation if it is to avoid becoming irrelevant to students. </p> <p>This narrowing of the political ground within the NUS will make the race for Labour Students' successor a closely run contest. Labour Students are already finding it difficult to take a back seat, with Andrew Pakes arguing that the issue is now \"whether students want to see the NUS lurch to the left or remain mainstream\". </p> <p>However, the direction the student movement will take after 18 years of Labour Students leadership is now in the hands of some 1,200 student delegates meeting in Blackpool next month. </p> <p><strong>Cast your vote</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.alisonangus.fsnet.co.uk\">Alison Angus</a>, currently NUS Black Students Officer, is standing as part of the \"United for Education - Free and Equal\" slate, which includes the Campaign for Free Education, Socialist Worker Students' Society and left independents. An \"independent left\" candidate, she describes herself as a socialist and a feminist, but has no party political affiliation. Angus says the slate includes \"people who have a track record of fighting for free education\".</p> <p><strong> On student grants: </strong> \"There should be a full living grant available for all students. We need to move away from the current situation where some students are working 40 hours a week outside their studies.\"</p> <p><strong> On top-up fees: </strong> \"Top-up fees are an attack on students and must be ruled out by the government, to avoid a two-tier education system. We need to remind Tony Blair that he promised to widen access to higher education.\" </p> <p><strong> On direct action:</strong> \"Direct action has proven itself to be an effective tool in making change where other forms of protest have been ignored. For example, NUS should stand side by side with Cambridge students, who have withheld thousands of pounds in rent from their university since rents were increased last October.\" </p> <p><strong> On non-payment of tuition fees:</strong> \"If it wasn't for some students voluntarily withholding their fees there would be nobody standing up for those who never went to university, or dropped out early, because they couldn't pay.\" </p> <p><strong> On NUS reform:</strong> \"Students are tired of the status quo in NUS. They want an open and inclusive union. We must end the current attitude of 'Labour Students good, non-Labour Students bad.\"</p> <p><strong> Message to the government:</strong> \"If I am elected NUS will become a national union that really campaigns on student issues. Rather than capitulating to the government, we will put pressure on them.\" <strong> www.alisonangus.fsnet.co.uk </strong> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:marktweedale@amatheia.f9.com\">Mark Tweedale</a> is a member of the NUS national executive and has a background as an activist in the further education sector. He is standing as a \"genuine independent\" and does not have a party political affiliation. His priority is to highlight what he sees as corruption and factionalism in NUS.</p> <p><strong> On the student grant:</strong> \"The grant should be restored and students should not have to rely on loans of any kind.

      "bodyText": "The threat of top-up fees looms large on the horizon for a student movement still reeling from the abolition of the grant and introduction of tuition fees. These issues will be on the agenda at this year's National Union of Students conference, to be held in Blackpool between 3-6 April. For the first time in 18 years, Labour Students are not fielding a candidate for NUS national president, the most powerful and influential position in the 3m-strong union, and one that they have held for almost two decades. Andrew Pakes, the current Labour Students president of the NUS, wants to see Labour Students focusing on building the grassroots of their organisation and winning the next general election for the Labour Party, rather than expending energy onwinning the leadership of the student movement. However, Labour Students are still fielding candidates for four out of six of the full-time NUS positions. Many students believe that fear of defeat is a more likely explanation for Labour Students' decision not to field a candidate for president. The group has been condemned by much of the student movement for the role they played in capitulating to the Labour party's anti-grant policy in the run-up to the 1997 general election. At the time, Labour argued that grants were unrealistic in a fiscally prudent world, and that the NUS should concentrate on preventing the introduction of tuition fees. In reality the NUS gave an inch and the government took a mile, capitalising on the student movement's compromise with the long-held principle of free education to abolish the grant and introduce fees. Labour Students might also be unwilling to lead the NUS now that top-up fees are back on the agenda. Number 10 is sympathetic to calls for the introduction of top-up fees from the Russell group of research universities, and have announced that a higher education funding review will take place in 2002. However, it is likely that the government will allow top-up fees to be introduced in some universities soon after the general election which, if it is held next spring or summer, would put a new Labour Students president in conflict with the Labour government. The next president of the NUS will inherit a divided student movement. From October Scottish students will be enjoying the fruits of devolution, in the form of means-tested bursaries and the replacement of tuition fees with a graduate contribution. Meanwhile, English and Welsh students will continue to be charged tuition fees and rely on loans for their maintenance. The next president of NUS will face pressure to win the Scottish concessions for English and Welsh students. The past two years have seen a rise in direct action, including mass non-payment of fees, occupations and rent strikes. The new president will be under pressure to support such action, particularly if it is endorsed by local students' unions. So who will the new president be? There are three candidates vying for the top job at this year's annual conference. Alison Angus, current NUS Black Students officer, Owain James, current NUS national secretary, and Mark Tweedale, a member of the NUS national executive committee. Whereas previous years have seen an acrimonious fight between Labour Students and the hard left for the presidency, this year the race is likely to be between James, an independent, and Angus, an independent left candidate leading the left's United for Education slate. The politics of the student movement appear to be narrowing. Whereas Labour Students supported the abolition of the grant in 1997, they now advocate its restoration for the poorest students. This brings them closer to the position of the traditional left in the NUS, who support universal grants. All three of this year's presidential candidates advocate the abolition of tuition fees, oppose top-up fees and believe that the minimum wage should be increased to at least \u00a35 per hour for all employees. There is also a shared conviction that the NUS must improve its campaigns and level of student participation if it is to avoid becoming irrelevant to students. This narrowing of the political ground within the NUS will make the race for Labour Students' successor a closely run contest. Labour Students are already finding it difficult to take a back seat, with Andrew Pakes arguing that the issue is now \"whether students want to see the NUS lurch to the left or remain mainstream\". However, the direction the student movement will take after 18 years of Labour Students leadership is now in the hands of some 1,200 student delegates meeting in Blackpool next month. Cast your vote Alison Angus, currently NUS Black Students Officer, is standing as part of the \"United for Education - Free and Equal\" slate, which includes the Campaign for Free Education, Socialist Worker Students' Society and left independents. An \"independent left\" candidate, she describes herself as a socialist and a feminist, but has no party political affiliation. Angus says the slate includes \"people who have a track record of fighting for free education\". On student grants: \"There should be a full living grant available for all students. We need to move away from the current situation where some students are working 40 hours a week outside their studies.\" On top-up fees: \"Top-up fees are an attack on students and must be ruled out by the government, to avoid a two-tier education system. We need to remind Tony Blair that he promised to widen access to higher education.\" On direct action: \"Direct action has proven itself to be an effective tool in making change where other forms of protest have been ignored. For example, NUS should stand side by side with Cambridge students, who have withheld thousands of pounds in rent from their university since rents were increased last October.\" On non-payment of tuition fees: \"If it wasn't for some students voluntarily withholding their fees there would be nobody standing up for those who never went to university, or dropped out early, because they couldn't pay.\" On NUS reform: \"Students are tired of the status quo in NUS. They want an open and inclusive union. We must end the current attitude of 'Labour Students good, non-Labour Students bad.\" Message to the government: \"If I am elected NUS will become a national union that really campaigns on student issues. Rather than capitulating to the government, we will put pressure on them.\" www.alisonangus.fsnet.co.uk Mark Tweedale is a member of the NUS national executive and has a background as an activist in the further education sector. He is standing as a \"genuine independent\" and does not have a party political affiliation. His priority is to highlight what he sees as corruption and factionalism in NUS. On the student grant: \"The grant should be restored and students should not have to rely on loans of any kind. The system in England and Wales should come into line with the new system in Scotland. The general principle should be that grants return and are increased in line with inflation each year. Housing benefit for students should also be restored.\" On top-up fees: \"Colleges are increasingly cash starved, so top-up fees will be an issue. We should fight for increased funding to be allotted to the education sector and the government should stop playing one sector off against the other.\" On direct action: \"Direct action is not a means in itself as some people see it, but is a tool that students should keep in their armoury for when it is appropriate.\" On NUS reform: \"The national union is being run in the interests of the factions and not its membership. It is in need of root-and-branch change from the ground up. The powers of the national president need to be curbed. Too much power and control rest on the unilateral say of one person.\" Message to the government: \"After 18 years the NUS will no longer be run in the interests of the Labour Party.\" Owain James is NUS national secretary. He is standing as an independent and is a member of the Labour Party. He wishes to see NUS become more powerful again, to involve students and turn it around from a factional battleground to an organisation that wins and changes things for students.

      "body": "<p>In the offices of the Higher Council of Education, a bureaucrat throws his hands into the air - he has lost count of the number of applications. \"Everyone wants to open a university in Jordan,\" he says with a sigh. \"There is an endless line.\"</p> <p>Most hopefuls have been rejected. But there is a burgeoning list of applicants who have succeeded, mirroring the regional trend to privatising higher education. In the past decade, 12 new private universities have opened their doors in Jordan, reflecting a sea change in higher education. \"It is a new experience - something within the last ten years in the Arab world - and the governments are trying to find what is the best way to guarantee that the profits are not at the expense of quality,\" says Marwan Kamal, head of the Arab Union of Universities. </p> <p>Until the past decade, universities in the Arab world have almost without exception been state-subsidised public institutions. Explains Kamal: \"People expected that the governments would take care of the education of their children. But now it is becoming difficult for the governments to do this.\" </p> <p>Jordan, tottering near bankruptcy, cannot sustain a state university system that subsidises two-thirds of the actual cost of tuition - nor expand places to meet a student demand growing 2%-4% a year. Competition is keen for the available university places, with public universities admitting only those with the highest scores in the college entrance exams. Even then, competition for the field of one's choice is difficult, with many students turned away or forced to study disciplines they don't choose. </p> <p>Jordanians, along with Gulf and Palestinian expats, are increasingly turning to the option of private \"for-profit\" universities in Jordan. </p> <p>The new universities have succeeded so spectacularly that higher education has become big business. \"It is the best investment in the country now - they are making millions,\" said Adnan Abu Odeh, member of the royal court and a life-time advocate of higher education. </p> <p>Other observers were less kind, referring to the businessmen-turned-chairmen of private universities as a \"mafia\", and terming the profit margin obscene. Insiders say one small Irbid university with a student enrolment under 3,000 netted a profit of $3m last year. </p> <p>Several years ago, the businessmen's lust for profit, versus the government's need to safeguard the university system, resulted in a crisis. Ahmed Husban, secretary-general of the Council of Higher Education, says: \"We discovered that the major hurdle... is the conflict between academic and financial management.\" The battle was joined over who would hold sway in the running of universities - professional, dedicated educators or hard-nosed investors - often with little formal education themselves. </p> <p>The upshot was a freeze on applications for private for-profit universities and stricter regulation of those already existing. But it is a battle not always resolved. \"This effect has been reduced a lot, but is still there. There is still some conflict,\" said Husban. And he admits: \"It is hindering academic progress.\" </p> <p> According to Adnan Abu Odeh, special advisor to King Abdullah and lifelong advocate of higher education, the freeze was intended also to address the issue of classical versus vocational education, and pressure the private sector to invest in vocational programmes needing expensive equipment. Says Odeh: \"The issue is the quality and type of human resources we are producing. The government doesn't want to see more people coming to the labour market with degrees screaming for jobs - while there are other vacancies that need people. [But] the private universities don't go into the areas that are needed because it's expensive.\" </p> <p>Yet the analysis of private for-profit education is not all negative. Adnan Badran, a respected educator and president of the private Philadelphia University, wants the field open to the private sector, with regulatory safeguards: \"I strongly believe that the market should be open to competition and competition will lead to [the point] where good universities will survive while bad universities will vanish. Leave it to the marketplace.\" He says private universities can respond more easily than the public sector to changing needs: \"This is why I am against the expansion of any more public universities, which are a burden on the taxpayer.\" </p> <p>Badran faults the existing \"free\" public system: \"People will study [anything] because it costs nothing. Taxpayers and the government are paying for graduating boys and girls in disciplines not needed any more.\" </p> <p>The newest venture in higher education is an attempt to establish private \"non-profit\" universities. Three hopefuls with initial approval are trying to meet the government's conditions. But the problem is finding donors.

      "bodyText": "In the offices of the Higher Council of Education, a bureaucrat throws his hands into the air - he has lost count of the number of applications. \"Everyone wants to open a university in Jordan,\" he says with a sigh. \"There is an endless line.\" Most hopefuls have been rejected. But there is a burgeoning list of applicants who have succeeded, mirroring the regional trend to privatising higher education. In the past decade, 12 new private universities have opened their doors in Jordan, reflecting a sea change in higher education. \"It is a new experience - something within the last ten years in the Arab world - and the governments are trying to find what is the best way to guarantee that the profits are not at the expense of quality,\" says Marwan Kamal, head of the Arab Union of Universities. Until the past decade, universities in the Arab world have almost without exception been state-subsidised public institutions. Explains Kamal: \"People expected that the governments would take care of the education of their children. But now it is becoming difficult for the governments to do this.\" Jordan, tottering near bankruptcy, cannot sustain a state university system that subsidises two-thirds of the actual cost of tuition - nor expand places to meet a student demand growing 2%-4% a year. Competition is keen for the available university places, with public universities admitting only those with the highest scores in the college entrance exams. Even then, competition for the field of one's choice is difficult, with many students turned away or forced to study disciplines they don't choose. Jordanians, along with Gulf and Palestinian expats, are increasingly turning to the option of private \"for-profit\" universities in Jordan. The new universities have succeeded so spectacularly that higher education has become big business. \"It is the best investment in the country now - they are making millions,\" said Adnan Abu Odeh, member of the royal court and a life-time advocate of higher education. Other observers were less kind, referring to the businessmen-turned-chairmen of private universities as a \"mafia\", and terming the profit margin obscene. Insiders say one small Irbid university with a student enrolment under 3,000 netted a profit of $3m last year. Several years ago, the businessmen's lust for profit, versus the government's need to safeguard the university system, resulted in a crisis. Ahmed Husban, secretary-general of the Council of Higher Education, says: \"We discovered that the major hurdle... is the conflict between academic and financial management.\" The battle was joined over who would hold sway in the running of universities - professional, dedicated educators or hard-nosed investors - often with little formal education themselves. The upshot was a freeze on applications for private for-profit universities and stricter regulation of those already existing. But it is a battle not always resolved. \"This effect has been reduced a lot, but is still there. There is still some conflict,\" said Husban. And he admits: \"It is hindering academic progress.\" According to Adnan Abu Odeh, special advisor to King Abdullah and lifelong advocate of higher education, the freeze was intended also to address the issue of classical versus vocational education, and pressure the private sector to invest in vocational programmes needing expensive equipment. Says Odeh: \"The issue is the quality and type of human resources we are producing. The government doesn't want to see more people coming to the labour market with degrees screaming for jobs - while there are other vacancies that need people. [But] the private universities don't go into the areas that are needed because it's expensive.\" Yet the analysis of private for-profit education is not all negative. Adnan Badran, a respected educator and president of the private Philadelphia University, wants the field open to the private sector, with regulatory safeguards: \"I strongly believe that the market should be open to competition and competition will lead to [the point] where good universities will survive while bad universities will vanish. Leave it to the marketplace.\" He says private universities can respond more easily than the public sector to changing needs: \"This is why I am against the expansion of any more public universities, which are a burden on the taxpayer.\" Badran faults the existing \"free\" public system: \"People will study [anything] because it costs nothing. Taxpayers and the government are paying for graduating boys and girls in disciplines not needed any more.\" The newest venture in higher education is an attempt to establish private \"non-profit\" universities. Three hopefuls with initial approval are trying to meet the government's conditions. But the problem is finding donors. According to Badran, the tax system does not help - there are neither tax incentives nor inheritance-tax exemption. Adds Kamal: \"For non-profit universities, you have to find the donors to put up the money with no expectations of financial returns. And philanthropy for education is a new experience here.\"",

The second attempt a few years later comes across like a Labour party election broadcast - glossy and clever, but difficult to believe. But now we have College Video 3, coming to a year 11 parents' meeting near you soon.</p> <p>This is the product we are pinning our recruitment hopes on. This feature will see them flocking through the doors come September - unless, of course, our rivals come up with something better. </p> <p>It's a cruel marketing world out there. Big budgets, high production values and casts of thousands are all part of a frenzy of video-making. There are hours of local access cable TV time to fill. Yet we didn't realise this until last term when Patty, our newly appointed head of corporate communications, arrived to drag us into the exciting world of Brand Integration Management. </p> <p>Before Patty came into our lives with her MBA and industry experience, we were a working party united by the fact that we all disagreed with each other. If a camel is a horse designed by a committee, then the struggle to produce a video can only end up with a turkey - over-cooked, stuffed full of excess and difficult to digest. It was Patty who saved me from the kind of meetings that went like this: </p> <p>\"What we want is a shot of the debating society in full flow with a voiceover of the principal welcoming everyone to the college.\" </p> <p>\"And I suppose you want a silver band playing Jerusalem,\" someone from performing arts would quip. </p> <p>\"What about narrative time and space?\" Clive from media studies was always saying. </p> <p>Patty was a breath of fresh air. Like Listerine to halitosis she set about the college video project with an antiseptic precision that left many a working party member gasping. She could do things with Power Point software that left me in awe. She dissolved her treatment into her production brief and then animated part of a storyboard. </p> <p>\"And that,\" she said, \"is how it will be.\" She stroked some keys on her laptop and invited questions. I glanced at Clive. Even he had succumbed to her seductive presentational discourse. </p> <p>Once Patty was in control, she drove us on with studied efficiency, and soon we were tossing shooting scripts about. We had a professional crew, all big lights and torn T-shirts, with a Yorkshire terrier on a pole that you had to speak into. My job was to get the students into the right place at the right time. If I didn't, someone with a mobile phone stuck to his ear would scowl at me. Patty called me the location manager, Clive called it mise-en-sc\u00e8ne or \"buggering prop shifter\". </p> <p>Roxanne, one of my more challenging students, had been selected to do a piece to camera. When I asked Patty why Roxanne was in the video she did something elaborate with her laptop for a moment. </p> <p>\"She fits the profile,\" she said. \"Gender, ethnicity, lifestyle awareness, full target slip differential, air bags and lifetime warranty...\" I realised that Roxanne was not just an ordinary student at an ordinary college. She was a brand identity. </p> <p>Getting Roxanne into the library for scene 97 was not easy. \"I never go to the library,\" she protested. </p> <p>\"All you've got to do is sit there, look up from a computer screen and talk to the camera about the brilliant IT facilities,\" I insisted. </p> <p>\"You mean, you want me to lie?\" </p> <p>\"Look, Roxanne, this is a professional video on a big budget, made by people who have extensive experience shooting documentaries in the home counties. We have a tight production schedule, we're running late and, yes, I want you to lie.\" </p> <p>The video receives its premiere next week, at which we are expected to mingle with captains of industry, headteachers and that bloke from the local rag who doubles up as education and gardening correspondent. </p> <p>Patty is proud of her achievement. The video does exactly what she set out to do. The college it depicts looks superb. But I have to agree with Roxanne. For all its beautiful production values, it doesn't mess with ugly reality.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Our first college promotional video looks very dated and lacking in pace. In fact, it is lacking in most areas, including being able to sustain the interest of its target audience. The second attempt a few years later comes across like a Labour party election broadcast - glossy and clever, but difficult to believe. But now we have College Video 3, coming to a year 11 parents' meeting near you soon. This is the product we are pinning our recruitment hopes on. This feature will see them flocking through the doors come September - unless, of course, our rivals come up with something better. It's a cruel marketing world out there. Big budgets, high production values and casts of thousands are all part of a frenzy of video-making. There are hours of local access cable TV time to fill. Yet we didn't realise this until last term when Patty, our newly appointed head of corporate communications, arrived to drag us into the exciting world of Brand Integration Management. Before Patty came into our lives with her MBA and industry experience, we were a working party united by the fact that we all disagreed with each other. If a camel is a horse designed by a committee, then the struggle to produce a video can only end up with a turkey - over-cooked, stuffed full of excess and difficult to digest. It was Patty who saved me from the kind of meetings that went like this: \"What we want is a shot of the debating society in full flow with a voiceover of the principal welcoming everyone to the college.\" \"And I suppose you want a silver band playing Jerusalem,\" someone from performing arts would quip. \"What about narrative time and space?\" Clive from media studies was always saying. Patty was a breath of fresh air. Like Listerine to halitosis she set about the college video project with an antiseptic precision that left many a working party member gasping. She could do things with Power Point software that left me in awe. She dissolved her treatment into her production brief and then animated part of a storyboard. \"And that,\" she said, \"is how it will be.\" She stroked some keys on her laptop and invited questions. I glanced at Clive. Even he had succumbed to her seductive presentational discourse. Once Patty was in control, she drove us on with studied efficiency, and soon we were tossing shooting scripts about. We had a professional crew, all big lights and torn T-shirts, with a Yorkshire terrier on a pole that you had to speak into. My job was to get the students into the right place at the right time. If I didn't, someone with a mobile phone stuck to his ear would scowl at me. Patty called me the location manager, Clive called it mise-en-sc\u00e8ne or \"buggering prop shifter\". Roxanne, one of my more challenging students, had been selected to do a piece to camera. When I asked Patty why Roxanne was in the video she did something elaborate with her laptop for a moment. \"She fits the profile,\" she said. \"Gender, ethnicity, lifestyle awareness, full target slip differential, air bags and lifetime warranty...\" I realised that Roxanne was not just an ordinary student at an ordinary college. She was a brand identity. Getting Roxanne into the library for scene 97 was not easy. \"I never go to the library,\" she protested. \"All you've got to do is sit there, look up from a computer screen and talk to the camera about the brilliant IT facilities,\" I insisted. \"You mean, you want me to lie?\" \"Look, Roxanne, this is a professional video on a big budget, made by people who have extensive experience shooting documentaries in the home counties. We have a tight production schedule, we're running late and, yes, I want you to lie.\" The video receives its premiere next week, at which we are expected to mingle with captains of industry, headteachers and that bloke from the local rag who doubles up as education and gardening correspondent. Patty is proud of her achievement. The video does exactly what she set out to do. The college it depicts looks superb. But I have to agree with Roxanne. For all its beautiful production values, it doesn't mess with ugly reality.",

Cloning is back in the news, thanks to the scientists who brought us Dolly the Sheep. Now they have managed to clone the first litter of pigs.</p> <p>They are claiming that this breakthrough could mean an end to the world shortage of healthy organs for organ transplants. They are confident that soon it will be possible to use the hearts, kidneys, livers and lungs from genetically altered pigs in human operations and waiting lists will vanish. But are we really about to enter a brave new world and should we trust the scientists? </p> <p><strong> How do they make a clone?</strong> </p> <p>In an adult creature the cells have long decided what they want to be - a part of the skin or a bone or a nerve, whatever. And until recently that was it. A cell's identity was fixed like a CD capable of playing just one track. This is fortunate because when we cut ourselves we want new skin cells growing back and not anything else. But scientists recognised that every cell also contains other information - genetic instructions from which a whole creature can be formed. In order for the ordinary cell to do a single job, these instructions have to be blocked. What scientists have discovered is how to lift that blockage. They make the grown-up cell \"totipotent\" - in that condition it can be used to create clones. </p> <p><strong> What happens next?</strong></p> <p>You take the DNA from the totipotent cell.

      "bodyText": "It is National Science Week and across the country we are being encouraged to question scientific research and debate key scientific issues. It is timely. Cloning is back in the news, thanks to the scientists who brought us Dolly the Sheep. Now they have managed to clone the first litter of pigs. They are claiming that this breakthrough could mean an end to the world shortage of healthy organs for organ transplants. They are confident that soon it will be possible to use the hearts, kidneys, livers and lungs from genetically altered pigs in human operations and waiting lists will vanish. But are we really about to enter a brave new world and should we trust the scientists? How do they make a clone? In an adult creature the cells have long decided what they want to be - a part of the skin or a bone or a nerve, whatever. And until recently that was it. A cell's identity was fixed like a CD capable of playing just one track. This is fortunate because when we cut ourselves we want new skin cells growing back and not anything else. But scientists recognised that every cell also contains other information - genetic instructions from which a whole creature can be formed. In order for the ordinary cell to do a single job, these instructions have to be blocked. What scientists have discovered is how to lift that blockage. They make the grown-up cell \"totipotent\" - in that condition it can be used to create clones. What happens next? You take the DNA from the totipotent cell. DNA is the basic genetic building block, the chemical plan that all living things contain. This is then injected into an egg cell from a female of the species you wish to clone. This receiving egg cell has already has its DNA removed. The new DNA is fused into the egg cell using a tiny electrical jolt. The egg cell is placed back in the female in order to grow in the usual way only the baby that results is a genetic copy of the original creature and has none of the \"mother's\" DNA. Is a clone just a genetic copy? Yes, because it will have different experiences and develop in a different environment from the original creature. In order to make a clone identical to its \"parent\", you would have to make the clone live an exact replica of the parent's life! What has been cloned?

If you doubt that figure, take a look at the government's <a href=\"http://www.educationunlimited.co.uk/specialreports/performance\">performance tables</a>, which list the number of children with an SEN statement. </p> <p>Thanks partly to greater awareness among parents, the number of children with statements has grown by over a third since 1992. </p> <p>Chris Abbott, who lectures and researches in ICT and SEN at King's College London, advises parents to have a look at the website of the organisation specialising in their child's needs. </p> <p>\"The strength of the web is special-interest groups, such as those for dyslexia. I'd be wary of saying it's the place to go for everything, although in the future, when we've got more interactive possibilities, that may change.\" Links to a number of these sites are listed in the secial needs section of Education Unlimited's <a href=\"http://www.educationunlimited.co.uk/netclass\">Netclass</a> and at the <a href=\"http://www.nasen.org.uk\">National Association for Special Educational Needs</a>. </p> <p>Happily, as this article goes to press, the government is preparing to launch a new site on March 23 dedicated entirely to SEN. <a href=\"http://inclusion.ngfl.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Inclusion</a> will be aimed initially at those who support SEN pupils, but will expand late this year to include learners themselves. </p> <p>A more <a href=\"http://www.dfee.gov.uk/sen/\">specialised site</a>, mostly relevant to SEN professionals, is already online - if you live in Scotland, the <a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library2/doc10/rssp1-00.asp\">support pack</a> should be helpful too. If you're working with visually-impaired learners, read the advice on <a href=\"http://www.rnib.org.uk/wedo/research/access.htm\">good web design</a>.</p> <p>Creating web material for SEN learners is a challenge that both <a href=\"http://www.sed.kcl.ac.uk/special/\" target=\"_NEW\">Abbott</a> and David Ware of Little Heath, a special school in Essex, are working on. Ware admits the medium is not particularly accessible for children with SEN. \"But we find sites that are appropriate for use in special projects.\" </p> <p>In association with a San Diego school, <a href=\"http://www.littleheath.essex.sch.uk/netlinks.htm\">Little Heath</a> has pioneered the online worksheet in the form of Netlinks.</p> <p>All pupils at Little Heath have an email address, helping projects like Spikelink. Spike is a teddy bear who has flown out to the San Diego partner school. As Little Heath envoy, Spike writes an online diary and responds to emails from pupils. Spikelink, Ware says, encourages confidence in pupils. \"It's using the technology to find out about another part of the world.\" What the web excels at.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In many schools, around a fifth of children will have special educational needs (SEN) at some point during their education. If you doubt that figure, take a look at the government's performance tables, which list the number of children with an SEN statement. Thanks partly to greater awareness among parents, the number of children with statements has grown by over a third since 1992. Chris Abbott, who lectures and researches in ICT and SEN at King's College London, advises parents to have a look at the website of the organisation specialising in their child's needs. \"The strength of the web is special-interest groups, such as those for dyslexia. I'd be wary of saying it's the place to go for everything, although in the future, when we've got more interactive possibilities, that may change.\" Links to a number of these sites are listed in the secial needs section of Education Unlimited's Netclass and at the National Association for Special Educational Needs. Happily, as this article goes to press, the government is preparing to launch a new site on March 23 dedicated entirely to SEN. Inclusion will be aimed initially at those who support SEN pupils, but will expand late this year to include learners themselves. A more specialised site, mostly relevant to SEN professionals, is already online - if you live in Scotland, the support pack should be helpful too. If you're working with visually-impaired learners, read the advice on good web design. Creating web material for SEN learners is a challenge that both Abbott and David Ware of Little Heath, a special school in Essex, are working on. Ware admits the medium is not particularly accessible for children with SEN. \"But we find sites that are appropriate for use in special projects.\" In association with a San Diego school, Little Heath has pioneered the online worksheet in the form of Netlinks. All pupils at Little Heath have an email address, helping projects like Spikelink. Spike is a teddy bear who has flown out to the San Diego partner school. As Little Heath envoy, Spike writes an online diary and responds to emails from pupils. Spikelink, Ware says, encourages confidence in pupils. \"It's using the technology to find out about another part of the world.\" What the web excels at.",

What would a crewcut look like on Brooklyn/the Queen/Frank Dobson/ a badger? Can I go home now?",

      "bodyText": "A government-funded report yesterday backed calls for the post of lord chancellor to be scrapped because of a conflict between his roles as politician and head of the judiciary. The report by Diana Woodhouse of Oxford Brookes University, which was funded by the economic and social research council, said the \"high political profile\" of the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, had magnified the tensions inherent in the post. The study adds to a growing body of opinion which argues that the lord chancellor, as a powerful politician with a leading role at the heart of government, should no longer sit as a judge in the House of Lords. But Lord Irvine is determined to go on hearing cases as long as government interests are not involved. Last May a working party of the law reform group Justice - made up of seven legal peers and a professor of law - said his dual role was \"inherently flawed\" and created an appearance of bias. It said reform was \"not a luxury but an urgent practical necessity\". The lord chancellor, apart from sitting as a judge and heading the judiciary, presides over the second chamber of parliament and fulfils responsibilities as a cabinet minister, including appointing judges. Professor Woodhouse criticises as \"dubious\" any justification for keeping the minister of justice - in effect the lord chancellor's main role - isolated from the \"rough and tumble\" of the House of Commons. She recommends that the post of lord chancellor should be abolished, and his responsibility for the legal system be transferred to a minister of justice or minister for legal affairs. The lord chief justice would become head of the judiciary, and a judicial commission would be set up to appoint judges. The report notes that Lord Irvine enjoys \"considerable influence at the centre of government\". He has had a central role, for example, in pushing through controversial legal aid reforms. Yet in theory he also has to protect judges from political influence. Noting the lord chancellor's \"closeness to the prime minister\", Professor Woodhouse writes: \"Lord Irvine's position at the centre of government raises questions about his role as head of the judiciary and as judge.\" Lawyers believe that Lord Irvine's position will become increasingly difficult once the Human Rights Act comes into force in October, bringing the European convention on human rights into English law. The English courts will have to take into account the case law of the European court of human rights, which recently decided that a man whose case was heard by the bailiff of Guernsey who, like the lord chancellor, sits as as judge and presides over the legislature, was denied a fair hearing.",

A similar collection of Audubon's work was auctioned by Christies in New York last week for $8m (\u00a35m). </p> <p>\"I think it is fair to say it was a good investment,\" said Tim Parrott, reference service manager at the library. </p> <p>\"The book is one of our oldest volumes and it is kept in the rare books section of the library. We were aware of how much we could get for it and the auction at Christies confirmed what we thought. We have no plans to sell it.

In 2000-01, the rise will be 3.25% or \u00a3300, whichever the greater, and some 90,000 staff, mainly ancillary workers, are expected to benefit from the flat rate. </p> <p>The increase for 1999-2000 will be 3% or \u00a3250, whichever the greater, and for 2001-02 a minimum of inflation plus 0.5%.<br>\u0095 David Brindle </p> <p><b>Sex case head freed on appeal</b><br>A former preparatory school head had his convictions for sexually abusing former pupils quashed as unsafe at the court of appeal yesterday. </p> <p>Lawyers for Robert \"Rory\" O'Brien, who served two months of a three-year jail sentence, are to seek compensation and to have his name removed from the sex offenders' register. </p> <p>Mr O'Brien, 57, who is married with five children, was head of St Mary's hall which sends boys to the Roman Catholic public school Stonyhurst college, in Lancashire. </p> <p>He was arrested in October 1998 by detectives investigating claims of child abuse spanning 30 years at the two schools. He was jailed at Preston crown court on five counts of indecently assaulting pupils, aged 10 and 11, in 1972 and 1998, but yesterday Lord Justice Rose, Mr Justice Klevan and Mr Justice Jackson ruled that the judge had been wrong in ordering that the events in the 70s and 90s should be tried together. </p> <p>They also refused the crown's application for a retrial on the 70s charges, saying it would be \"oppressive\" considering the length of time Mr O'Brien had \"had these matters hanging over him\". </p> <p>Mr O'Brien was head of St Mary's from 1990 until he was suspended in 1998 and took early retirement. </p> <p>The police investigation began after a former pupil accused Mr O'Brien of sexually assaulting him in the 70s. Mr O'Brien was acquitted but convicted of the other counts which followed police interviews with hundreds of former and present pupils. </p> <p>The allegations from the boys who went to St Mary's together in the 1970s \"emanated from a desire for revenge\", according to the defence. </p> <p><b>Madonna with child once more</b><br>The pop star and actress Madonna revealed yesterday that she is pregnant with her second child. </p> <p>A statement issued on behalf of the 41-year-old singer and Guy Ritchie, 31, who she has been dating for a year, said that they were \"happy to confirm rumours\" that they were expecting a child at the end of the year. </p> <p>Mr Ritchie, who directed the hit gangland film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, said: \"We would be grateful if the media would kindly allow us some privacy at this special time and we thank you all for your good wishes.\" </p> <p>The baby will be a sibling to three year old Lourdes, Madonna's daughter by her fitness instructor Carlo Leon. </p>",

A similar collection of Audubon's work was auctioned by Christies in New York last week for $8m (\u00a35m). \"I think it is fair to say it was a good investment,\" said Tim Parrott, reference service manager at the library. \"The book is one of our oldest volumes and it is kept in the rare books section of the library. We were aware of how much we could get for it and the auction at Christies confirmed what we thought. We have no plans to sell it. We are here to safeguard the heritage of the people of Liverpool.\" Around 200 copies of the book were completed, but only 100 have survived. \u0095 Helen Carter NHS curbs managers' pay rises Almost 100,000 low paid health workers will get a bigger percentage pay rise than hospital managers under an edict issued by Sir Alan Langlands, NHS chief executive. Hospital and community trusts are being instructed their pay bill for chief executives and senior managers must rise no more than 3.25% in the next financial year. The lowest paid NHS staff will get a rise of up to 3.7% as part of a three-year deal for 350,000 workers not covered by pay review body awards. Sir Alan's order came in a letter to trusts and health authorities, which are technically free to set their own terms for managers. Chief executives of the bigger hospital trusts can now expect to be paid comfortably in excess of \u00a3100,000 a year, while the average is \u00a374,000. The letter said there were no specific problems recruiting or retaining managers. \"It is therefore important that equity is maintained across the service.\" Trusts and authorities will be required to show they have not exceeded the 3.25% cash limit, Sir Alan said, although they will have room to vary individual rises. The three-year deal for other workers, including ambulance crews, scientists and clerical workers, is the first of its kind. In 2000-01, the rise will be 3.25% or \u00a3300, whichever the greater, and some 90,000 staff, mainly ancillary workers, are expected to benefit from the flat rate. The increase for 1999-2000 will be 3% or \u00a3250, whichever the greater, and for 2001-02 a minimum of inflation plus 0.5%. \u0095 David Brindle Sex case head freed on appeal A former preparatory school head had his convictions for sexually abusing former pupils quashed as unsafe at the court of appeal yesterday. Lawyers for Robert \"Rory\" O'Brien, who served two months of a three-year jail sentence, are to seek compensation and to have his name removed from the sex offenders' register. Mr O'Brien, 57, who is married with five children, was head of St Mary's hall which sends boys to the Roman Catholic public school Stonyhurst college, in Lancashire. He was arrested in October 1998 by detectives investigating claims of child abuse spanning 30 years at the two schools. He was jailed at Preston crown court on five counts of indecently assaulting pupils, aged 10 and 11, in 1972 and 1998, but yesterday Lord Justice Rose, Mr Justice Klevan and Mr Justice Jackson ruled that the judge had been wrong in ordering that the events in the 70s and 90s should be tried together. They also refused the crown's application for a retrial on the 70s charges, saying it would be \"oppressive\" considering the length of time Mr O'Brien had \"had these matters hanging over him\". Mr O'Brien was head of St Mary's from 1990 until he was suspended in 1998 and took early retirement. The police investigation began after a former pupil accused Mr O'Brien of sexually assaulting him in the 70s. Mr O'Brien was acquitted but convicted of the other counts which followed police interviews with hundreds of former and present pupils. The allegations from the boys who went to St Mary's together in the 1970s \"emanated from a desire for revenge\", according to the defence. Madonna with child once more The pop star and actress Madonna revealed yesterday that she is pregnant with her second child. A statement issued on behalf of the 41-year-old singer and Guy Ritchie, 31, who she has been dating for a year, said that they were \"happy to confirm rumours\" that they were expecting a child at the end of the year. Mr Ritchie, who directed the hit gangland film Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, said: \"We would be grateful if the media would kindly allow us some privacy at this special time and we thank you all for your good wishes.\" The baby will be a sibling to three year old Lourdes, Madonna's daughter by her fitness instructor Carlo Leon.",

Exchanging paracetamol tablets for aspirin is not the answer, say the scientists, because aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen can cause dangerous sensitivity reactions in asthmatics and must not be given to children because they can cause Reye's syndrome - a rare but potentially fatal condition. \"However there may be scope for some individuals who take paracetamol on a daily or weekly basis to reduce their frequency of usage,\" they say. \"Furthermore, in a recent survey, 3% of adult analgesic users reported regularly taking more than the recommended dose.\"",

Following the publication yesterday of the treasury-inspired Cruickshank review of high street banks, the chancellor will support proposals for a new watchdog to monitor cash machines and other payment systems, and a tightening up of banking supervision to stop banks being able to \"write their own rules\". The review document sets out 53 recommendations predominantly aimed at breaking the stranglehold the big banks have on current accounts, the provision of services to small business, and the way money is transmitted around the system behind the scenes. Sixteen months in preparation, the 344-page review concluded that \"neither personal or small business customers are getting a fair deal from banks\". The head of the review team, the former telecoms regulator Don Cruickshank, said the UK public was paying between \u00a33bn and \u00a35bn a year too much for banking services, which amounted to between \u00a340 and \u00a3400 per household. Yesterday, ministers were quick to act on one of his key recommendations - that there should be a full investigation into the way banks treat small businesses because there is \"little prospect of effective competition\" in this area. The trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, said the provision of banking services to small and medium-sized firms was being referred to the competition commission. Mr Cruickshank called on the government to increase transparency and competition in the banking industry. Some of his harshest criticism was reserved for the way the big banks control and operate the UK's payment systems, which include everything from cash machine net works to cheque clearing. Cash machine charges were \"excessive\" - he has said customers should pay no more than 30p - while, despite the recent advances in technology, cheques still typically took three days or more to clear, and retailers were paying too much for the facility of accepting credit card payments, which impacts particularly on smaller stores and pushes up prices across the economy as a whole. The big banks' hold over money transmission systems was hitting new and smaller banks and made it difficult for them to compete on a level playing field when it came to current accounts. The \"big four\" banks - Barclays, Lloyds TSB, HSBC and NatWest - hold almost 70% of current accounts. Mr Cruickshank recommended that banks wishing to be part of a payment system such as a cash machine network should have to obtain a licence from the Treasury. He called for the creation of a new independent regulator, PayCom, to monitor this new regime. Other recommendations include: \u0095 Better information made available to help people compare products. The Financial Services Authority, the main City watchdog, should be given powers to collect and publish information on prices so that people could see who offered the best deal; \u0095 Giving the 3m people who do not have a bank account access to basic banking services; \u0095 Strengthening complaints handling procedures, with \"clear and objective standards\" for banks to be judged against. The report comes days after it was announced that the \"big four\" banks made profits of more than \u00a313bn between them last year. The banks said that they needed time to study the report but insisted they were competitive. \"It remains our view that the British banking industry is both effective and competitive, and delivers customers good value for money,\" said Tim Sweeney, director general of the British Bankers' Association.

Ministers promised there would be no hiding place for abusers under the guidelines, which follow a series of scandals involving elderly people, mentally ill people and those with physical and learning disabilities. An inquiry report, released on Friday, found there had been \"degrading and cruel\" treatment of dementia patients at a hospital in Carlisle, Cumbria. Yesterday, three senior managers involved in the inquiry were suspended. The guidelines, entitled No Secrets, are aimed at preventing sexual and physical abuse and neglect and discrimination, in all settings - including people's own homes. The strategy involves all care agencies, but social services directors are being given responsibility for ensuring its implementation by the end of October next year. The government's social services inspectorate will monitor progress. Measures include tightening recruitment checks on care workers, putting in place formal procedures for raising concerns and introducing specialist training for managers and investigators. John Hutton, the social care minister, said: \"Abuse of people in any setting is unacceptable. The government is taking strong measures to ensure that this cannot and does not happen in the future. We must treat vulnerable citizens with the respect that they deserve.\" Social welfare charities welcomed the guidelines as a watershed in terms of recognising the problem of abuse of adults, but said still more needed to be done. Richard Kramer, the head of campaigns at the learning disability charity Mencap, said the strategy failed to address the information needs of those at risk. \"There remains a yawning gap in the training and education of vulnerable adults in understanding abuse,\" he said. The North Lakeland NHS trust, responsible for the hospital in the Carlisle scandal, said it had suspended, pending further investigation, its personnel director, training manager and locality manager for the Carlisle district.

The winner will be announced in June. </p> <p>Her theme is not untypical of an entry dominated by \"stories of migration from one culture to another\", according to the judges' chairwoman, Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee. </p> <p>\"At least nine of the books are about this\", she said, \"It's a tremendous wellspring for tension and imagination. </p> <p>\"After reading them all, you look at mothers begging with babies in their laps - Romanians or whatever - and you think, those kids are going to write a book some day.\" </p> <p>Long-listed authors include Leila Aboulela, Anita Desai, Laura Hird, Sunetra Gupta, AL Kennedy, Shauna Singh Baldwin and Eilis Ni Dhuibhne. Themes range from Sudanese, Indian, Pakistani or Irish migration to Jewish emigrants in postwar Palestine. </p> <p>However, male readers will be apt to judge these books not by their stories but by a quick look at titles and covers, according to a survey on gender conducted by Orange. </p> <p>They are likely to buy Ms Smith's White Teeth only if they mistake it for a thriller about sharks: Ms Baldwin's What the Body Remembers if they think it is a sex manual; and Barbara Ewing's The Dangerous Vine if they expect it to be a detective story about wine growing. </p> <p>For them, the long-list's safest bet is Julie Leigh's The Hunter because it sounds like a thriller. </p> <p>\"If they talk about emotions, depression, understanding oneself - that's for women\", said one of the men among the 200 regular literary fiction readers interviewed in the survey. </p> <p>A woman reader said: \"Men haven't the slightest idea how to write about women. They are all stereotypes, either sluts or mothers\". </p> <p>The sample was shown 20 already-published books, some of them modern classics.

      "bodyText": "Zadie Smith, the Cambridge graduate who won a reported \u00a3250,000 advance for her first two novels at 24, yesterday became one of 20 authors in line for the \u00a330,000 Orange fiction prize, the biggest in Britain. Her novel White Teeth, celebrating two generations of multicultural family life in north London, is on the long-list for the award, which is open to women only. The winner will be announced in June. Her theme is not untypical of an entry dominated by \"stories of migration from one culture to another\", according to the judges' chairwoman, Guardian columnist Polly Toynbee. \"At least nine of the books are about this\", she said, \"It's a tremendous wellspring for tension and imagination. \"After reading them all, you look at mothers begging with babies in their laps - Romanians or whatever - and you think, those kids are going to write a book some day.\" Long-listed authors include Leila Aboulela, Anita Desai, Laura Hird, Sunetra Gupta, AL Kennedy, Shauna Singh Baldwin and Eilis Ni Dhuibhne. Themes range from Sudanese, Indian, Pakistani or Irish migration to Jewish emigrants in postwar Palestine. However, male readers will be apt to judge these books not by their stories but by a quick look at titles and covers, according to a survey on gender conducted by Orange. They are likely to buy Ms Smith's White Teeth only if they mistake it for a thriller about sharks: Ms Baldwin's What the Body Remembers if they think it is a sex manual; and Barbara Ewing's The Dangerous Vine if they expect it to be a detective story about wine growing. For them, the long-list's safest bet is Julie Leigh's The Hunter because it sounds like a thriller. \"If they talk about emotions, depression, understanding oneself - that's for women\", said one of the men among the 200 regular literary fiction readers interviewed in the survey. A woman reader said: \"Men haven't the slightest idea how to write about women. They are all stereotypes, either sluts or mothers\". The sample was shown 20 already-published books, some of them modern classics. The men tended to relegate 12 of them to a \"female reads only\" category. These included Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient, which some of them are likely to have taken by its title as a nursing romance; Iris Murdoch's The Sandcastle (bringing up kids), Angela Carter's Wise Children (ditto); Anne Tyler's Ladder of Years (sewing); George Eliot's Middlemarch (provincial romance) and John Fowles' s The French Lieutenant's Woman (Napoleonic romance). Ian McEwan's Enduring Love was rated firmly in the \"female reads\" camp by 78% of men but only 38% of women. Fewer than 30% of men said they would be interested in reading it - partly, the survey suggests, because of its pink cover. Some 57% of women were interested. Only 13% of men, compared with 70% of women, would consider reading The English Patient. For Wise Children, the figures were 29% and 69%. Middlemarch scored better, with 50% of men compared with 75% of women. The book that scored highest as a male read was Nick Hornby's High Fidelity. Several books were seen as \"neutral reads\" not specially for men or women. These included Dickens's Great Expectations, perhaps because it was assumed to be about money; Beryl Bainbridge's Every Man for Himself because of its title and adventurous cover showing the Titanic; and Pat Barker's Regeneration, for its war theme and because the author was assumed to be a man. The survey verdict is that \"men are far more biased towards books written by men than women are to books written by women.\" This year's judges are Ms Toynbee, Claire Beaumont of Waterstone's, the novelist Bonnie Greer, Ffion Hague, the wife of the Conservative party leader, and the writer and historian Amanda Foreman.

Without it, he said, there would be no admissible evidence to back up the defendants' claims. The alleged terrorists, their lawyers argued, had sent material to Algeria in self-defence against Algerian government forces. The prosecution - which earlier admitted that the security services had bugged a conversation between the three Algerian defendants and their lawyer at the Belmarsh top security prison in south-east London - offered no further evidence. The judge formally entered a not guilty verdict against Sofiane Kebilene, 33, Farid Boukemiche, 29, and Sofiane Souidi, 33, accused of being supporters of the Armed Islamic Group. They were arrested by the police in London in the summer of 1997 after a five-month surveillance operation by MI5. Ken McDonald QC, leading defence counsel, said they were arrested after contacts between Algerian interior ministry officials and officials at the British embassy in Algiers. They were charged with possessing \"chemical containers , radio equipment, manuals, documents, credit cards and sums of money, in circumstances which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the articles were in their possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism\". It was the first time charges have been laid under section 16a of the prevention of terrorism act described a year ago by Lord Bingham, the lord chief justice, as undermining \"in a blatant and obvious way, the presumption of innocence\". Almost identical clauses appear in the new terrorism bill. Lord Bingham said that by reversing the burden of proof the section almost certainly contravened the European convention on human rights. Despite his judgment, backing up an earlier ruling by Judge Pownall, the director of public prosecutions, David Calvert-Smith, was determined to press ahead. The prosecution pursued the case despite secret documents showing British intelligence believed the Algerian government was involved in atrocities, contradicting the view the government was claiming in public. Three cabinet ministers - Jack Straw, Geoffrey Hoon and Robin Cook - signed public interest immunity certificates in an attempt to suppress the evidence. When secret documents, mainly from the Foreign Office, were produced on the orders of the trial judge - 18 months after the defence asked for them - they were in marked contrast to the government's publicly-stated view, expressed by the Foreign Office in 1998, that there was \"no credible, substantive evidence to confirm\" allegations implicating Algerian government forces in atrocities. Nigel Sweeney, prosecution counsel, admitted yesterday that an MI5 source had secretly testified that he had \"frequently seen people suspected of being members of the GIA (the armed Islamic group) and the FIS (the Islamic Salvation Front) beaten up, abducted and killed by the army.\" He said the Algerian army and police had \"written authority to do whatever necessary against suspected members of the GIA and FIS\". Documents the ministers wanted to suppress but read out earlier in open court revealed that Whitehall's joint intelligence committee stated that \"responsibility for violence cannot be conclusively laid in one place... There is no firm evidence to rule out gov ernment manipulation or involvement in terrorist violence\". Sources had privately said some of the killings of civilians were the responsibility of the Algerian security services, one document said. Another document, dated January 1997, reports a British source as saying \"military security [in Algeria] would have... no scruples about killing innocent people... My instincts remain that parts of the Algerian government would stop at nothing\". Other documents referred to the \"manipulation\" of the GIA being used as a cover to carry out their own operations. A US intelligence report - also read out in open court - said there was no evidence to link 1995 Paris bombings to Algerian militants, suggesting that one killing at the time could have been ordered by the Algerian government. One Whitehall document says that its suspicions about the activities of Algerian government forces \"if revealed could open us to detailed questioning by NGOs [non government organisations, such as human rights groups] and journalists\". An estimated 100,000 people have been killed in Algeria since 1991. Mr McDonald told the court last month that it would be an \"affront to the public conscience to proceed\".

During the course of pre-trial hearings - held in open court but which could not be disclosed until now - the security services admitted bugging a conversation between the defendants and their lawyer at Belmarsh.

      "bodyText": "Doreen Lawrence is to make a fresh appeal tonight for information about the murder of her son Stephen along with the officer in charge of the investigation into the racist killing of the teenager seven years ago. She will join deputy assistant commissioner John Grieve, who is head of the Metropolitan police's racial and violent crimes task force, on the BBC's Crimewatch UK programme to ask for further help in bringing her son's killers to justice. Mr Grieve is expected to tell viewers that there is still hope of prosecuting the gang of white youths who stabbed the 18-year-old A-level student to death at a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London in April 1993, because he believes \"allegiances change over time\". Mr Grieve will say: \"Seven years have passed since the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence, but we know several people out there can turn the keys to locking up those responsible. Allegiances change over time. \"We nearly have the full picture and I am relying on Crimewatch viewers to help complete it. \"Crimewatch has always generated a nugget of gold for us. I'm sure tonight will be no different.\" Last night Mr Grieve was confirmed as a special advisor to the police inquiry into the hangings of two black men in Telford, Shropshire. Mr Grieve will advise Peter Hampson, chief constable of West Mercia police, on the inquiry into the deaths of Harold McGowan and his nephew Jason, 20 last year. Mrs Lawrence's appeal on Crimewatch is the first time that the programme has featured her son's murder and it is hoped that it will lead to new developments in the case. It is not the first time Crimewatch has been used in an attempt to track down clues in other racist attacks. Last year the programme showed secu rity footage in an attempt to gain information into the death of Asian student Ricky Reel. Mr Reel was on a night out in Kingston upon Thames on October 14, 1997, when he and his friends were attacked by white racists and scattered. He was never seen alive again and his body was pulled from the Thames a week later. The programme has also highlighted the death of Michael Menson, a musician who was attacked and set on fire on his way to Chase Farm hospital, Enfield, north London, to receive an injection he needed to control his schizophrenia. Police initially thought that he had set fire to himself, but later decided that he had been the victim of a racially motivated attack. He later died in hospital and an appeal on the programme last year led to new information that helped the police track down his attackers. While no one has been convicted for Stephen's murder five men have at various times been arrested, and a private criminal prosecution brought against three of them collapsed. The appeal on Crimewatch comes as Stephen's parents Neville and Doreen press ahead with a compensation claim against the police officers involved in the bungled murder investigation. They are suing 42 police officers who range from the rank of constable to superintendent, including the former Metropolitan police commissioner Sir Paul Condon Under writs issued in December the officers are being sued under section 20 of the Race Relations Act, which refers to discrimination on grounds of race. The Stephen Lawrence inquiry report published in February 1999 found that it was a fully justified conclusion to say that racism played its part in the investigation. Duwayne Brooks, who was with Stephen when he died, issued writs against 15 officers in August.",

In MORI's January poll, voters ranked Europe as the fourth most important issue facing the country, whereas taxation ranked only 15th.</p> <p>However it is early days yet, and since taxation is thought to have worked well for Tories in the past, William Hague is going to push it hard. Last week's speech making a \"moral\" case for low tax is a sign of things to come. He will also have been encouraged by the government's admission that the tax burden has increased since 1997 as a percentage of GDP. Stand by for an aggressive response to today's Budget.</p> <p>But there are dangers for the Tories in tax. Look at the British election survey data in the chart. In 1997 more than two-thirds of voters believed that taxation had increased during the previous five years, during John Major's tenure at Number 10. Nearly a third believed that taxes had increased a lot. About three-quarters of Liberal Democrat and Labour voters thought the tax burden had increased, with nearly 40% of the latter thinking it had increased by a lot. Even among Tory voters a solid majority believed the tax burden had increased on Major's watch and only a fifth thought it had declined. Thus voters are not likely to believe promises from the Tory leader about reducing taxation, given the record of the Tories in the past.</p> <p>One way round Hague's problem would to convince voters the increased tax burden was somehow not the Tories' fault. However, in the same 1997 survey, when respondents were asked if tax increases were the responsibility of the Major government, no less than 89% thought that they were, and only 9% thought that tax increases occurred for other reasons. Thus John Major's government was not able to escape its responsibility.</p> <p>Another interesting but little noticed feature of the tax debate is that in recent years the Tories have been moving more and more out of step with public opinion. In both the 1992 and 1997 election studies, voters were asked to place themselves along an 11-point scale to measure their attitudes to taxation and spending. If they gave themselves a score of one on this scale it meant that they felt very strongly that both taxation and spending should be increased. If they gave themselves a score of 11 it meant that they strongly supported cuts in both taxation and spending. A midpoint score of six meant that they opted for the status quo. They were also asked to score the policy positions taken by the parties on the same scales.</p> <p>In 1992 the average score for voters as a whole was 3.9 which indicated that they preferred tax and spending increases to cuts. By 1997 it had shifted to 3.7, showing that support for tax and spending had increased a tiny amount. Most interesting were the scores which voters assigned to the political parties. In 1992 they gave Labour an average score of 2.8 which showed that it was perceived as very much a \"tax and spend\" party. By 1997 this score had shifted to 3.6, which almost coincided with the preferences of the average voter. Labour had literally moved to the middle ground on this issue in the minds of the electorate.</p> <p>The equivalent figures for the Conservatives tell a different story, however. Their 1992 score was 4.8, but by 1997 it had jumped to 6.9. Rather than moving closer to the preferences of the average voter, the Tories had moved further away from them. The Liberal Democrats scored 3.7 on both occasions, which in 1997 coincided exactly with the views of the average voter. Given this, the Liberal Democrat pledge to increase income tax by 1p in the pound in 1997 probably helped rather than harmed their campaign.</p> <p>Thus a future Tory election campaign based on promises of tax cuts faces two problems. On the one hand, they are perceived to be out of touch with voters on the issue and William Hague's high-decibel campaign is likely to make that worse rather than better. Secondly, they are perceived to have failed to deliver on the cuts they promised when they were in power. At the moment it appears that Michael Portillo has a much better sense of the electoral possibilities of this issue than does his boss.</p> <p>To make taxation stick, William Hague has to do two things. Firstly, he has to raise its salience in the minds of the public. In the MORI survey only 5% of voters saw it as important. Second, he has to convince the electorate that the Tories under his leadership would do things differently from last time around. This is going to be a tough task since the MORI survey indicates that only 19% of the electorate think that he is doing a good job as leader of the opposition (56% think the opposite). In contrast 53% of voters think Tony Blair is doing a good job as prime minister (38% disagree).</p> <p>New Labour is neurotic about tax, given its experience at the 1992 election. It should relax.

Well, with Oscar night fast approaching, the usual hordes of Hollywood flotsam and jetsam will be far too busy perfecting their looks of flabbergasted humility to bother pumping up their latest product over here. But fret not, as the funniest man in modern film-making, Peter Farrelly, co-creator with sibling Bobby of such scatological comic delights as There's Something About Mary and Dumb And Dumber, is bucking the trend during a week-long sojourn plugging his semi-autobiographical Tinseltown satire The Comedy Writer. Having already visited the NFT last night, he's now embarked on a tour of the country's Borders Bookshops, with Leeds today, Brighton tomorrow, and a return to London on Thursday... When worlds collide... Meanwhile, on an altogether higher intellectual plane, Susan Sontag arrives on Thursday to regale the nation's press in promotion of her latest novel, In America. Whether this means the woman responsible for some of the greatest works of critical theory ever written will get to meet the man responsible for immortalising Jeff Daniels suffering a seismic bout of diarrhoea somewhere in the bowels of Heathrow remains, as yet, unclear. La Vida Loca... And armchair postmodernists of an ad agency persuasion will no doubt already be aware that this week finds the UK playing host to mix'n'match nabob Beck, who pitches up later this week for shows in support of his latest album Midnite Vultures. For those with a yen for such matters, he plays Wembley on Thursday, Manchester Friday, and Glasgow this Saturday.

      "byline": "Meg Carter",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>ITV, sore from the embarrassing loss of Home And Away to the upstart Channel 5, is desperately seeking a new, home-grown soap. The call has gone out to producers from across the land to come up with an idea for an original, home-produced, youthful alternative. A new national viewing institution could soon be born. But what recipe will best suit today's internet-literate viewing tastes? </p> <p>More than any other programming genre, a successful soap must be truly in tune with its time. Key ingredients for success, along with pacey plot, are recognisible characters, and situations the viewer can easily identify and empathise with. But it must also be in tune with its audience's aspirations. </p> <p>Britain's first TV soap, Coronation Street, was born into an era of working class values. BBC1's long overdue response, EastEnders, was the first child of the 80s with its own resident yuppie in the form of Ian Beale (whose Thatcherite ideals endure). </p> <p>Both Corrie and EastEnders owe their longevity in part to the community spirit each conveys. Even if not all of us fancy the idea of living next door to a Dot Cotton, at least these neighbours talk to each other. Their staying-power has also been helped by the subtle evolution which has seen various additions over the years, including wine bars, night clubs, gyms - even a nanny. </p> <p>By the end of the decade, Eldorado had tried tapping into the boom times with a sun, sea 'n' sangria mix featuring ex-pats on the Costa del Sol... and failed. More recent entrants, however, have found greater success closer to home. Hollyoaks' early preoccupation with teenage party-going and who's-snogging-who storylines established a firm following (before the recent arrival of grittier themes, such as last week's look at male rape). And then there's Dream Team - set around the loves and lives of the friends, families and players at a local football club. </p> <p>But what about the first new soap of the millennium? What setting, themes and storylines will prove themselves to be most in tune with the mood of today? ITV Network Centre is eagerly discussing ideas with the half-dozen or so producers designated \"preferred suppliers\" who will put forward their ideas for the network's new soap in coming weeks. </p> <p>For the time being, at least, the brief remains pretty open - although insiders say the dream ticket will be one able to deliver a far younger audience profile than network stalwart Coronation Street. As the nation awaits the puff of white smoke from ITV programme director David Liddiment's office, leading figures from across the industry have some strong ideas about how a new soap will find a niche in today's overcrowded schedules. </p> <p>Brian Park, former Coronation Street producer and executive producer of ITV prison drama Bad Girls 2, which airs in April, feels a new soap has to capture the mood of the nation if it has any chance of finding a loyal audience. </p> <p>\"There is an appetite for something with a younger skew,\" he says. \"Look at the zeitgeist now and the taste is for rough 'n' ready - right here, right now, to paraphrase Norman Cook. The 'net generation' is already used to greater accessibility. Any new soap would also have to appeal to growing generations no longer hide-bound to being in a job from apprentice at 16 to silver clock at 65. The feeling of seizing the future would have to be central. </p> <p>\"Over and above that, you'd need characters with baggage to unravel over time, and a setting where worlds can collide. Which points to a metropolitan soap with traditional versus alternative, middle age versus youth.\" </p> <p>Corinne Hollingworth, Channel 5 director of programmes and one-time executive producer of EastEnders feels a new soap can't make the mistake of trying too hard to copy existing favourites: \"The current 'big three' are all fairly nostalgic - looking backwards to a world dominated by family and the community, being able to leave your back door open all day, which just isn't true to life any more. </p> <p>\"Now people choose where they live rather than staying where they grew up. With over 50 per cent of us middle class, working-class values do not prevail anymore. </p> <p>\"For all that, any new soap would have to be all about character, which, in itself, is pretty timeless. And I would caution against a four or five times a week soap set in the workplace. You have to be able to get to know the characters' background - go home with them. </p> <p>\"You have to start by thinking what you can provide that is not already there. My advice would be: 'don't do it'.\" </p> <p>Verity Lambert, originator of former BBC1 soap Eldorado and founder of production company Cinema Verity, feels a new soap would have to look beyond traditional boundaries. </p> <p>\"They could do worse than revise Eldorado - even though I got my fingers burned on that one at the time. It's about Europe, and it addresses other current issues, such as people moving away in search of work. </p> <p>\"Otherwise, well, running for London mayor would surely make a good backdrop for a new TV soap. Or, equally topical: something based around life in a focus group.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "ITV, sore from the embarrassing loss of Home And Away to the upstart Channel 5, is desperately seeking a new, home-grown soap. The call has gone out to producers from across the land to come up with an idea for an original, home-produced, youthful alternative. A new national viewing institution could soon be born. But what recipe will best suit today's internet-literate viewing tastes? More than any other programming genre, a successful soap must be truly in tune with its time. Key ingredients for success, along with pacey plot, are recognisible characters, and situations the viewer can easily identify and empathise with. But it must also be in tune with its audience's aspirations. Britain's first TV soap, Coronation Street, was born into an era of working class values. BBC1's long overdue response, EastEnders, was the first child of the 80s with its own resident yuppie in the form of Ian Beale (whose Thatcherite ideals endure). Both Corrie and EastEnders owe their longevity in part to the community spirit each conveys. Even if not all of us fancy the idea of living next door to a Dot Cotton, at least these neighbours talk to each other. Their staying-power has also been helped by the subtle evolution which has seen various additions over the years, including wine bars, night clubs, gyms - even a nanny. By the end of the decade, Eldorado had tried tapping into the boom times with a sun, sea 'n' sangria mix featuring ex-pats on the Costa del Sol... and failed. More recent entrants, however, have found greater success closer to home. Hollyoaks' early preoccupation with teenage party-going and who's-snogging-who storylines established a firm following (before the recent arrival of grittier themes, such as last week's look at male rape). And then there's Dream Team - set around the loves and lives of the friends, families and players at a local football club. But what about the first new soap of the millennium? What setting, themes and storylines will prove themselves to be most in tune with the mood of today? ITV Network Centre is eagerly discussing ideas with the half-dozen or so producers designated \"preferred suppliers\" who will put forward their ideas for the network's new soap in coming weeks. For the time being, at least, the brief remains pretty open - although insiders say the dream ticket will be one able to deliver a far younger audience profile than network stalwart Coronation Street. As the nation awaits the puff of white smoke from ITV programme director David Liddiment's office, leading figures from across the industry have some strong ideas about how a new soap will find a niche in today's overcrowded schedules. Brian Park, former Coronation Street producer and executive producer of ITV prison drama Bad Girls 2, which airs in April, feels a new soap has to capture the mood of the nation if it has any chance of finding a loyal audience. \"There is an appetite for something with a younger skew,\" he says. \"Look at the zeitgeist now and the taste is for rough 'n' ready - right here, right now, to paraphrase Norman Cook. The 'net generation' is already used to greater accessibility. Any new soap would also have to appeal to growing generations no longer hide-bound to being in a job from apprentice at 16 to silver clock at 65. The feeling of seizing the future would have to be central. \"Over and above that, you'd need characters with baggage to unravel over time, and a setting where worlds can collide. Which points to a metropolitan soap with traditional versus alternative, middle age versus youth.\" Corinne Hollingworth, Channel 5 director of programmes and one-time executive producer of EastEnders feels a new soap can't make the mistake of trying too hard to copy existing favourites: \"The current 'big three' are all fairly nostalgic - looking backwards to a world dominated by family and the community, being able to leave your back door open all day, which just isn't true to life any more. \"Now people choose where they live rather than staying where they grew up. With over 50 per cent of us middle class, working-class values do not prevail anymore. \"For all that, any new soap would have to be all about character, which, in itself, is pretty timeless. And I would caution against a four or five times a week soap set in the workplace. You have to be able to get to know the characters' background - go home with them. \"You have to start by thinking what you can provide that is not already there. My advice would be: 'don't do it'.\" Verity Lambert, originator of former BBC1 soap Eldorado and founder of production company Cinema Verity, feels a new soap would have to look beyond traditional boundaries. \"They could do worse than revise Eldorado - even though I got my fingers burned on that one at the time. It's about Europe, and it addresses other current issues, such as people moving away in search of work. \"Otherwise, well, running for London mayor would surely make a good backdrop for a new TV soap. Or, equally topical: something based around life in a focus group.\"",

There was no left-of-centre party for thousands of Sudanese intellectuals, who either felt obliged to collaborate with religious fanatics or the extreme left. The only other alternative was to join one of the two main parties, the Ashiqa or the Umma, where religion and politics are now increasingly inseparable. After the 1964 revolution, Ismael formed the Socialist Congress party, encouraging his wife, Safiyya, to become a member of its executive committee. But the SCP, without funds or popular appeal, sank without trace. By the late 1960s, Ismael had become frustrated by the lack of recognition of his talents. Impressed by the radical agenda put forward when a second military coup toppled the Umma government in May 1969, he accepted the offer of its leader, Colonel Gaafar Nimeri, to become Sudanese ambassador to London. Thus did the restorer of democracy of 1964 arrive in London in 1970 representing a military regime. Back in the Sudan, Nimeri announced, that November, a plan for a federation of Egypt, Sudan and Libya. In July 1971, opposition to the scheme led to an abortive, three-day coup, backed by Sudanese communists. It coincided with the presence in London of two of the 1969 coup leaders - a Sudanese Communist party member and a Marxist. During those three days press conferences were held at the embassy and Nimeri's photograph was removed from the embassy walls. The two men set off for Khartoum, but en route Libya's Colonel Gadafi had their plane forced down and its occupants arrested. Nimeri, meanwhile, regained power in Khartoum and had the two men - and many others - shot. Ismael, their host, had better luck; he was only recalled and dismissed. Having had enough of political ambitions and public life, he concentrated on his legal practice until his death. He is survived by his wife, two daughters and five sons. \u0095 Abdeen Ismael, lawyer and diplomat, born 1915; died January 3 2000",

      "body": "<p>Cab Kaye, who has died aged 78, was an exciting jazz performer whose significance went further than the ability to deliver an effervescent song while playing stride piano in the style of a latter-day Fats Waller. A singer with echoes of Billie Holiday in his voice, he also played guitar and drums, travelling widely during an extraordinary life, yet never losing his place in the British jazz psyche. His presence served as a link between the local jazz community and the music's African past.</p> <p>He was born in St Giles High Street, an area where London's black West-enders congregated after the first world war, when his mother, a music-hall artist, married Caleb Jonas Kwamlah Quaye, an African drummer from the then Gold Coast. Known professionally as Mope Desmond, Quaye worked with American musicians such as the clarinet virtuoso Sidney Bechet, but his two children never knew him. He died in a rail accident when Cab was four months old, and the family moved to Portsmouth.</p> <p>Kaye's African pedigree resonated with music. His paternal grandfather had been the organist at Accra's Methodist church; his great-grandfather played drums for a company of Asafo warriors.</p> <p>Kaye himself started in showbusiness as a teenager. At 14, he frequented the Shim Sham and the Nest, nightclubs that welcomed black entertainers, and got to know such figures as the American trombonist Ellis Jackson, who worked with Billy Cotton's showband. Cotton hired the youngster to sing, their recording of Shoe Shine Boy launching his career. At 18, he married Theresa Austin, the daughter of a Barbadian seaman, who sang with his later bands. Their three children include noted guitarist Caleb and singer/percussionist Terri Quaye.</p> <p>The onset of the Blitz found Cab singing and sharing Ivor Kirchin's drumseat at Tottenham Court Road's Paramount dancehall, with Steve Race on piano; later, he joined Ken \"Snakehips\" Johnson's West Indians at the Caf\u00e9 de Paris. Military service saved him from the bomb that fell on the caf\u00e9, killing Johnson, but he was injured while in the Merchant Navy. Shipwrecked and torpedoed, he was then badly hurt in a plane crash, necessitating an operation in New York. While recuperating, he played with an extraordinary roll-call of jazzmen, including the trumpeter Roy Eldridge,</p> <p>In 1946, with Leslie \"Jiver\" Hutchinson's band, Kaye travelled to India to entertain the forces, returning to play host at Feldman's Sunday Oxford Street sessions, introducing Jamaican arrivants, such as saxophonists George Tyndale and Sammy Walker, to an audience eager for new jazz ideas. To African seamen who went to Feldman's to dance, Kaye was a totem, an admired fellow-African. He occupied a similarly inspira tional role for burgeoning local modernists like Ronnie Scott and bebop guru Dennis Rose, both of whom played in his band.</p> <p>Kaye worked and recorded with many prominent jazz musicians and dance bands - including Tito Burns and Ted Heath - but often employed fellow black Britons. In 1953, he formed a double-act with the singer/dancer Josie Woods, and led a trio with the Liverpudlian drummer Tommy Jones and Trinidadian bassist Brylo Forde. During a long stay in Holland, Kaye met Charlie Parker, then established himself in Paris, where he became a regular at the fabled Ringside Club.</p> <p>Through increasing contact with the new black settlers, Kaye's confidence, and sense of himself as an African, developed, and he dropped his anglicised stage-name. At home in East Finchley, he would dress in Ghanaian kente cloth and, although he never used it professionally, revived his Ga name, Nii-lante.</p> <p>When Ghana achieved independence, Kaye was working with Erie Delaney and Humphrey Lyttelton. He was soon offered a post as entertainments manager in his father's homeland, although the job ended abruptly when the country's first ruler, Kwame Nkrumah, was deposed. A Nigerian sojourn followed, interspersed with a 1964 visit to New York; then, in 1970, Kaye returned to Britain with Evelyn, his Nigerian wife.</p> <p>In London, he attempted to rekindle the excitement of an earlier era, but encountered changes. He found a happier mileu in Amsterdam, where he opened a piano bar, and, in 1979, remarried. He is survived by his third wife, Jeanette, and their three children; the three children of his first marriage and another son, the singer Finley Quaye.</p> <p>\u0095 Augustus Kwamlah (Nii-lante) Quaye, singer, pianist, entertainer, born September 3 1921; died March 13 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Cab Kaye, who has died aged 78, was an exciting jazz performer whose significance went further than the ability to deliver an effervescent song while playing stride piano in the style of a latter-day Fats Waller. A singer with echoes of Billie Holiday in his voice, he also played guitar and drums, travelling widely during an extraordinary life, yet never losing his place in the British jazz psyche. His presence served as a link between the local jazz community and the music's African past. He was born in St Giles High Street, an area where London's black West-enders congregated after the first world war, when his mother, a music-hall artist, married Caleb Jonas Kwamlah Quaye, an African drummer from the then Gold Coast. Known professionally as Mope Desmond, Quaye worked with American musicians such as the clarinet virtuoso Sidney Bechet, but his two children never knew him. He died in a rail accident when Cab was four months old, and the family moved to Portsmouth. Kaye's African pedigree resonated with music. His paternal grandfather had been the organist at Accra's Methodist church; his great-grandfather played drums for a company of Asafo warriors. Kaye himself started in showbusiness as a teenager. At 14, he frequented the Shim Sham and the Nest, nightclubs that welcomed black entertainers, and got to know such figures as the American trombonist Ellis Jackson, who worked with Billy Cotton's showband. Cotton hired the youngster to sing, their recording of Shoe Shine Boy launching his career. At 18, he married Theresa Austin, the daughter of a Barbadian seaman, who sang with his later bands. Their three children include noted guitarist Caleb and singer/percussionist Terri Quaye. The onset of the Blitz found Cab singing and sharing Ivor Kirchin's drumseat at Tottenham Court Road's Paramount dancehall, with Steve Race on piano; later, he joined Ken \"Snakehips\" Johnson's West Indians at the Caf\u00e9 de Paris. Military service saved him from the bomb that fell on the caf\u00e9, killing Johnson, but he was injured while in the Merchant Navy. Shipwrecked and torpedoed, he was then badly hurt in a plane crash, necessitating an operation in New York. While recuperating, he played with an extraordinary roll-call of jazzmen, including the trumpeter Roy Eldridge, In 1946, with Leslie \"Jiver\" Hutchinson's band, Kaye travelled to India to entertain the forces, returning to play host at Feldman's Sunday Oxford Street sessions, introducing Jamaican arrivants, such as saxophonists George Tyndale and Sammy Walker, to an audience eager for new jazz ideas. To African seamen who went to Feldman's to dance, Kaye was a totem, an admired fellow-African. He occupied a similarly inspira tional role for burgeoning local modernists like Ronnie Scott and bebop guru Dennis Rose, both of whom played in his band. Kaye worked and recorded with many prominent jazz musicians and dance bands - including Tito Burns and Ted Heath - but often employed fellow black Britons. In 1953, he formed a double-act with the singer/dancer Josie Woods, and led a trio with the Liverpudlian drummer Tommy Jones and Trinidadian bassist Brylo Forde. During a long stay in Holland, Kaye met Charlie Parker, then established himself in Paris, where he became a regular at the fabled Ringside Club. Through increasing contact with the new black settlers, Kaye's confidence, and sense of himself as an African, developed, and he dropped his anglicised stage-name. At home in East Finchley, he would dress in Ghanaian kente cloth and, although he never used it professionally, revived his Ga name, Nii-lante. When Ghana achieved independence, Kaye was working with Erie Delaney and Humphrey Lyttelton. He was soon offered a post as entertainments manager in his father's homeland, although the job ended abruptly when the country's first ruler, Kwame Nkrumah, was deposed. A Nigerian sojourn followed, interspersed with a 1964 visit to New York; then, in 1970, Kaye returned to Britain with Evelyn, his Nigerian wife. In London, he attempted to rekindle the excitement of an earlier era, but encountered changes. He found a happier mileu in Amsterdam, where he opened a piano bar, and, in 1979, remarried. He is survived by his third wife, Jeanette, and their three children; the three children of his first marriage and another son, the singer Finley Quaye. \u0095 Augustus Kwamlah (Nii-lante) Quaye, singer, pianist, entertainer, born September 3 1921; died March 13 2000",

The long siege had started on February 28 when federal agents arrived at the complex to arrest the sect leader, David Koresh, on weapons charges.</p> <p>To try to resolve the opposing claims a federal judge ordered a unique simulation exercise. It took place on Sunday at the largest military base in the US, Fort Hood in Texas. Lawyers for both sides were there, along with special investigators and government and FBI officials.</p> <p>The three-hour exercise was conducted far from the public gaze but reports say it involved eight US army marksmen firing a variety of weapons from various positions in a debris strewn area of the base that had been arranged to approximate to the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas, at the time of the siege.</p> <p>As the soldiers fired their weapons, they were recorded by a hired Royal Navy Lynx helicopter equipped with heat-sensing infra-red cameras identical to those with which the FBI recorded the original siege. The exercises were repeated four times, officials said.</p> <p>Flashes recorded on the original video are at the heart of the Davidian camp's assertion that the FBI fired more than tear gas into the compound in 1993. The question is whether the flashes reveal people, heated debris, sunlight reflections or shots.</p> <p>While the FBI and the Davidian relatives differ on what the reconstruction proved, a British specialist company has the job of making an independent finding. Vector Data Systems Ltd of Peterborough is meant to complete its analysis within 30 days.</p> <p>Its conclusions will play a key role in two separate proceedings arising out of the Waco siege - a civil damages suit brought by the relatives against the US government, which goes to court on May 15; and the official inquiry into the ending of the siege, which is taking place under a former Republican senator, John Dan forth of Missouri. It was he who asked for the simulation.</p> <p>Infrared experts from both sides of the argument have been given the preliminary evidence - probably including digital copies of the tapes - from Sunday's exercise.</p> <p>The FBI side was the first to make a public claim yesterday that the exercise had vindicated its position that no shots were fired. \"We are very pleased with the results we have seen so far,\" said Mike Bradford, one of the government legal team in the case.</p> <p>\"There are some particular matters that we think are important in confirming our position,\" he continued. \"And we believe we will clearly demonstrate that, through the comparison of these materials to the tapes.\"</p> <p>Lawyers for the Branch Davidian side responded by sticking to their version of events. The new video \"clearly supports\" the case made by the relatives, lawyer Michael Caddell said in Houston, insisting: \"It clearly demonstrates that there was government gunfire.\"</p>",

But lawyers for relatives of the Davidians drew precisely the opposite conclusion: they said the film of the reconstruction showed just the contrary of the FBI interpretation. They repeated their long-standing accusation that the reason everybody in the sect complex perished at the end of the 51-day siege was that US government agents fired at the compound, preventing escape. The claims are at the centre of a legal and political controversy between relatives and supporters of the Davidians - who contend that the FBI, and by implication the Clinton administration, have the victims' blood on their hands - and the US government, which says that the deaths at Waco on April 19 1993 were caused by some Davidians who were bent on an apocalyptic end. The long siege had started on February 28 when federal agents arrived at the complex to arrest the sect leader, David Koresh, on weapons charges. To try to resolve the opposing claims a federal judge ordered a unique simulation exercise. It took place on Sunday at the largest military base in the US, Fort Hood in Texas. Lawyers for both sides were there, along with special investigators and government and FBI officials. The three-hour exercise was conducted far from the public gaze but reports say it involved eight US army marksmen firing a variety of weapons from various positions in a debris strewn area of the base that had been arranged to approximate to the Branch Davidian compound at Waco, Texas, at the time of the siege. As the soldiers fired their weapons, they were recorded by a hired Royal Navy Lynx helicopter equipped with heat-sensing infra-red cameras identical to those with which the FBI recorded the original siege. The exercises were repeated four times, officials said. Flashes recorded on the original video are at the heart of the Davidian camp's assertion that the FBI fired more than tear gas into the compound in 1993. The question is whether the flashes reveal people, heated debris, sunlight reflections or shots. While the FBI and the Davidian relatives differ on what the reconstruction proved, a British specialist company has the job of making an independent finding. Vector Data Systems Ltd of Peterborough is meant to complete its analysis within 30 days. Its conclusions will play a key role in two separate proceedings arising out of the Waco siege - a civil damages suit brought by the relatives against the US government, which goes to court on May 15; and the official inquiry into the ending of the siege, which is taking place under a former Republican senator, John Dan forth of Missouri. It was he who asked for the simulation. Infrared experts from both sides of the argument have been given the preliminary evidence - probably including digital copies of the tapes - from Sunday's exercise. The FBI side was the first to make a public claim yesterday that the exercise had vindicated its position that no shots were fired. \"We are very pleased with the results we have seen so far,\" said Mike Bradford, one of the government legal team in the case. \"There are some particular matters that we think are important in confirming our position,\" he continued. \"And we believe we will clearly demonstrate that, through the comparison of these materials to the tapes.\" Lawyers for the Branch Davidian side responded by sticking to their version of events. The new video \"clearly supports\" the case made by the relatives, lawyer Michael Caddell said in Houston, insisting: \"It clearly demonstrates that there was government gunfire.\"",

He has immortalised his life and loves in print, chronicled a gay generation annihilated by Aids, and likened himself to the final musician left on stage \"still squeaking away on my violin\". You might expect a tortured soul; you would be wrong. </p> <p>White is charming, modest, matter of fact: an intellectual with rare patience; a teacher (professor of creative writing at Princeton) always ready to listen. He ponders the anonymity of writers in New York, where he now lives, and the press attention they get in London, and says it's because Britain has so few film stars. The absence of ego may account for the strength of his work: he does not seek to judge but to report. </p> <p>When White's novel, The Farewell Symphony, appeared in 1997, the irresistible hook in all the interviews was that the narrator (clearly based on White himself) had had sex with 3,120 men. This was held up as some sort of defining fact, but White simply mocked the figure - \"Is it enough?\" - and implied that three partners a week over 20 years wasn't really so shocking. It is typical of his disarming style: his subject matter can be raw and painful - his new novel, The Married Man, details the death of his lover from Aids - but he refuses to emote. </p> <p>The novel is a memorial to a young French architect called Hubert Sorin, who died in 1994. The odd fact has been altered, but in essence the novel records their life together in Paris and the US, and Sorin's death in Morocco. White was diagnosed as HIV positive in 1985, and Sorin moved in with him in 1989 believing he would have to nurse him through his inevitable decline. But White did not decline - he knows now that he has a rare non-progressive form of the infection and his condition is stable. Instead, Sorin was diagnosed as having Aids (not contracted from White) and it was the author who had to do the nursing over the five years they lived together. </p> <p>But why novelise what is so obviously a memoir? \"This is a terribly personal book,\" says White, \"but I found that by writing in the third person I was able to look at myself in a more satirical way. When you write in the first person, you're expected to be presenting a kind of apology for your life. People assume that this is you at your best, as though you are St Augustine showing your progress towards your present point of moral superiority, whereas in fact you have a fairly rounded and satirical view of yourself. The third person gets you off the hook; it makes it seem as if you're writing about someone out there, objectively.\" </p> <p>That remorseless truth-telling is typical of White. \"There will be people who say The Married Man deals with Hubert harshly,\" he says, \"but I felt that if I didn't deal with him honestly, it wouldn't be a good book. So much of the Aids literature I've read is lachrymose and sentimental, with the couple shown as very noble from beginning to end. There is that side to Julien [Hubert's name in the novel], but there's also a lot of anger, which to me seems normal to someone who is in his early 30s, terribly ambitious and has his life taken away.\" </p> <p>White, who is 60, is now so well established, and gay writing so much a part of the literary landscape, that it is easy to overlook the struggle that characterised the early part of his career. He was one of the first gay writers - Christopher Isherwood was his hero and literary role model - to want explicitly to explore his sexuality in fiction. But he suffered more than 20 years of frustration before the publication of his breakthrough book, A Boy's Own Story, in 1983. </p> <p>\"I wanted to write about gay life, but people didn't want to publish it,\" he says. \"I wrote a number of books that still exist in my archive at Yale, which were never published. But I think they were rejected not because they were low in literary quality but because they were so explicitly gay.\" </p> <p>Is there a danger that, as a writer of gay fiction, he might be marginalised? \"I had already published two avant-garde artistic novels when I started writing gay fiction, and people said to me, 'Oh, you're going to ruin your career.' I remember reading a Paris Review interview with Saul Bellow in which he said that when he first started writing Jewish fiction all of his friends told him the same thing - nobody wants to read about Jews, it's too small, you should write about universal themes.\" </p> <p>White worked as a journalist and editor in the 60s and 70s (he wrote The Joy of Gay Sex and a book called States of Desire about America's gay communities), and lived the cruisy gay life in New York documented in The Beautiful Room is Empty and The Farewell Symphony. Those books are, in part, elegies to a pre-Aids world, but he defends the hedonism of those times. </p> <p>\"It was very mandarin in one way - dedicated to the highest, most abstract notion of culture - but it was also highly sexual,\" he says. \"New York in the 70s was like the last gasp of the old bohemian spirit. People weren't materialistic; they were interested in the idea of living in a cold-water flat and being a great artist. I wanted to show that cultured world, too - people who were intellectual but also very sexual. The stereotype is that you are either one or the other, but you can be both.\" </p> <p>White's trilogy - A Boy's Own Story, The Beautiful Room is Empty, and The Farewell Symphony - is an attempt to record the history of a gay culture (he once called himself \"Everyfag\"). He is, against all the odds, a survivor, and feels it is his duty to honour the generation wiped out by Aids. \"I believe that in another 20 years someone will sit down to write the history of New York in the 70s, and it will turn out to be one of the great periods of creativity in American life. Gays played an enormous role in that and sexual licence was part of the package.\" </p> <p>Does he feel guilty that he lived? \"People who are HIV positive don't have much survivor guilt,\" he says. \"They feel that they are going to be victims soon enough. But now that I seem to have entered this category of non-progressives, I do feel some degree of guilt. It's also hard not to feel numb, and the worst thing for a writer is to feel numb.

Mr Howells has played a key part in the government's campaign against \"rip-off Britain\". Last year he called for an official inquiry into soft drink prices in pubs, and also likened mortgage misselling to the pensions scandal.",

      "body": "<p>Yes Television, the video-on-demand company which recently signed a joint venture to pipe films down British Telecom wires, yesterday announced plans for a flotation which will value the business at around \u00a3600m. </p> <p>The company is expected to raise \u00a3150m-\u00a3200m in the offer, which will be used to fund the national roll out of its ven ture with BT. As part of the flotation, two of the companies largest suppliers of movies, Warner Bros and Buena Vista, Disney's distribution arm, will take stakes. </p> <p>\"Their decision to take a stake in the business is a strong endorsement,\" said Yes Television chairman Thomas Kressner. \"They are saying this is a real product that is here and working. It also says they are pleased with the way their content is being presented.\" </p> <p>Mr Kressner, a former Morgan Stanley stockbroker who holds some 25% of the company, will become a multi-millionaire. </p> <p>BT-Yes Television is being tested in 400 homes in west London using ADSL technology which upgrades existing copper wires for high bandwidth applications such as internet access and broadcasting. </p> <p>The service called Total Television aims to offer hundreds of movies, kids channels, education, music videos and TV programming all of which can be viewed at any time. The service has the functionality of a video recorder allowing pause or rewind. It will also offer internet access via the TV and e-mail. </p> <p>Video Networks, Yes Television's chief rival in the video-on-demand market is also considering a flotation. Like Yes Television, Video Networks uses ADSL technology to send films and TV programming down existing copper wire lines and has 1,500 subscribers. </p> <p>BT has announced targets of upgrading 6m homes to ADSL by the end of this month and 75% of the population within three years. </p> <p>Both Video Networks and Yes Television will be competing for the same customers, as BT is forced to offer the service wholesale to rival companies. The local network is entirely opened to competition in the middle of next year.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Yes Television, the video-on-demand company which recently signed a joint venture to pipe films down British Telecom wires, yesterday announced plans for a flotation which will value the business at around \u00a3600m. The company is expected to raise \u00a3150m-\u00a3200m in the offer, which will be used to fund the national roll out of its ven ture with BT. As part of the flotation, two of the companies largest suppliers of movies, Warner Bros and Buena Vista, Disney's distribution arm, will take stakes. \"Their decision to take a stake in the business is a strong endorsement,\" said Yes Television chairman Thomas Kressner. \"They are saying this is a real product that is here and working. It also says they are pleased with the way their content is being presented.\" Mr Kressner, a former Morgan Stanley stockbroker who holds some 25% of the company, will become a multi-millionaire. BT-Yes Television is being tested in 400 homes in west London using ADSL technology which upgrades existing copper wires for high bandwidth applications such as internet access and broadcasting. The service called Total Television aims to offer hundreds of movies, kids channels, education, music videos and TV programming all of which can be viewed at any time. The service has the functionality of a video recorder allowing pause or rewind. It will also offer internet access via the TV and e-mail. Video Networks, Yes Television's chief rival in the video-on-demand market is also considering a flotation. Like Yes Television, Video Networks uses ADSL technology to send films and TV programming down existing copper wire lines and has 1,500 subscribers. BT has announced targets of upgrading 6m homes to ADSL by the end of this month and 75% of the population within three years. Both Video Networks and Yes Television will be competing for the same customers, as BT is forced to offer the service wholesale to rival companies. The local network is entirely opened to competition in the middle of next year.",

Besides, where else is there to go? Switzerland is too cold, the Bahamas too far.\" </p> <p><strong> Creatures of habit</strong></p> <p> Many of the British residents are creatures of habit, who enjoy the same routine nearly every day. You don't have to look hard to find them. For example, sitting in the bar at the Hotel de Paris most lunchtimes are the Barclay brothers - owners of the Scotsman newspaper and the London Ritz hotel. In their blue pinstriped suits, they choose the same table every day, rarely talking to anyone as they sip coffee or aperitifs. Entertainment is provided by the hotel's pianist, who has a repertoire of funereal Frank Sinatra numbers and easy-listening hits from the 1940s. </p> <p>Next door at the famed Monte Carlo casino, flamboyant corporate raider Philip Green enjoys rather more upbeat entertainment. Having failed in his recent attempt to bid for Marks &amp; Spencer, Mr Green has been consoling himself at the blackjack tables, often gambling with chips worth 50,000 francs (\u00a35,000) each. A devout Tottenham fan, Mr Green is sometimes seen with Irving Scholar, the former property tycoon who once chaired Spurs and has a home in Monaco. </p> <p>On the other side of the Golden Square of the Place du Casino - the heart of Monaco's glamour district - lunchtime company at the Caf\u00e9 de Paris includes metals dealers Simon Reuben and his brother David, enjoying a leisurely glass of vintage wine and a plate of the finest fois gras. Multi-millionaire racehorse owners Michael Charlton and Michael Tabor often sit at tables nearby, keeping in touch with the latest racing results from Cheltenham via mobile phone. </p> <p>Behind the caf\u00e9 is the Metropole hotel - slightly downmarket of the Hotel de Paris, but still beyond most folk at \u00a3150 a night. The hotel is home to Andrew Regan, the man who tried to buy the Co-operative Wholesale Society three years ago. Mr Regan is now wanted by the serious fraud office for allegedly stealing money from shareholders. He is unable to leave Monaco's square kilometre, for fear of arrest and extradition. </p> <p>Mr Regan lives with his former-model wife Nikki and their six children, a floor above the residence of car parks millionaire Stephen Tucker - who sold his Europarks business in 1990 to National Car Parks for \u00a35m. </p> <p>Mr Regan and Mr Tucker like dining at Rampoldis - a smart Italian restaurant below the hotel which despite the \u00a315 starters and impressively thick wine list is decked out like an upmarket Aberdeen Steak House, all red couchettes and dim lights. The food comprises meats and fish with rich sauces, the conversation is relaxed and the maitre'd cannot do enough for his regular diners. </p> <p>Other Rampoldi customers include Nigel Robertson - one of the founders of online directories business Scoot.com who still holds more than \u00a3100m worth of shares - and former copper dealer Ashley Levett. </p> <p>Mr Levett lives down the hill in an apartment block on a wide boulevard called Avenue de Princesse Grace. Just a gear change from the grand prix track it enjoys panoramic views over the sea. </p> <p>Mr Levett was cleared by the authorities after an investigation into the Winchester Commodities copper scandal five years ago. His business partner at the time was Charlie \"Copperfingers\" Vincent, another Monaco resident who still deals on the copper market. Further along Avenue de Princesse Grace is a block called Houston Palace, home to another clutch of former City names including Ronnie Reeves - best known for selling investment business Eastern &amp; General to Legal &amp; General for \u00a3150m in the 1980s. </p> <p>Mr Reeves is a friend of Gary Amos, a broker still active on the London market who is famed for the shrewd timing of his deals. </p> <p>The most popular drinking venue on the Avenue de Princess Grace is Sass Caf\u00e9, a strange mixture of cabaret, disco and a band playing Abba covers. There the Brits mingle with a steady stream of Italian and Middle Eastern businessmen, grand prix drivers and ageing pop stars. Prince Albert, heir to the throne, occasionally drops in with a date. </p> <p>Besides the sun and low taxes, businessmen generally list security as the state's biggest asset. It is said that if you were to drop your wallet in the street it would be handed in at the local police station, complete with contents, within minutes. At Jimmy'z, Monaco's biggest and most popular nightspot, there is not a single bouncer on the door, just a glamorous female attendant taking entrance money. </p> <p>Low-grade crime is simply not an issue. Monaco has more police per head than any other country in the world - one bored policeman for every 67 residents. Discreet closed-circuit television cameras monitor many of the public areas, even phone calls are routinely monitored. </p> <p>It's the way the wealthy like it. One British resident says: \"You don't have to keep looking over your shoulder. You don't stand out here if you're a millionaire - the next man along could be a billionaire.\" </p> <p>There are few signs of the social exclusion that dogs other capitalist nations. The poor are discouraged through a series of strict, often authoritarian, rules. Walking shirtless on is prohibited and begging on the daily-scrubbed streets is unheard of. </p> <p>\"People think nothing of walking around in fur coasts and diamond neck laces that would make them an instant target in Nice or Cannes,\" one resident said. \"Being stopped by the police and asked for identity papers can be a pain but at least it's safe.\" </p> <p>However, just a short walk from the exclusive Hotel de Paris stands a grim reminder that even a fabulously wealthy police state can breed paranoia. </p> <p>The burnt out remains of the harbourside home of the late billionaire banker Edmond Safra are surrounded by scaffolding. Last December a fire gutted the building and suffocated the founder of Republic Bank of New York. The tragedy shook Monaco to the core, particularly because Safra was obsessive about security. </p> <p>When they saw the building alight, many paranoid millionaires rushed for the phone to check that their funds were safe in the bank downstairs. Initial rumours that the Russian mafiosi who populated Monaco for a while in the mid 1990s were to blame fuelled the sense of unease. But the police soon announced that a member of Safra's staff had confessed to starting the fire. Some of Monaco's more paranoid residents whisper that the manservant was not wholly responsible. </p> <p>A younger breed of British entrepreneurs is moving to the principality and Monaco doesn't want to lose them. </p> <p>Some Britons - such as multi-millionaire tax avoidance expert Michael Charlton - have been in Monaco for decades but a recent influx of younger tax exiles has pushed up the profile of the place. Part of the reason has been a relaxation in attitude on the part of the government. </p> <p>Mr Charlton says: \"They used to be quite sniffy if you turned up and said you were 37-years-old and retired. But they've eased up a lot on that - I think they realised there was a need for a more youthful population.\" </p> <p>The basic requirements for residence are that applicants have no criminal record, are not bankrupt and can support themselves. Residency requires that people live in Monaco for at least half the time, entitling them to an entirely tax-free lifestyle, other than paying hefty VAT in the shops. </p> <p>Until recently a popular ruse was to rent an apartment in Monaco but spend most of your time across the French border in your cliff-top villa at Antibes or Cap Ferrat, but a clampdown by French authorities has greatly reduced the number of people flouting Monaco's residency rules. The demographics of the British expatriates are changing. A decade ago most of the British residents had made their money and were moving south to put their feet up. But the likes of Messrs Regan, Tucker, Green and Levett are still working hard and playing an active role back in the UK. The exact nature of most of their plans remain sketchy. A typical response is: \"I'm investing in a few dot.com companies but then, aren't we all?\" </p> <p>Others will only admit they have \"interests\" which they would rather keep private. When they do reluctantly say what they are doing it is usually on a strictly \"off the record\" basis. </p> <p>Of those plans that are in the public domain, Stephen Tucker is finalising plans to take control of Storehouse, the retailing group, and he emerged recently as the main backer of New Capital Invest - an AIM-listed internet vehicle. </p> <p>Philip Green pops up with regular retail deals - his last big coup was buying and breaking up Sears, the owner of Freemans, Warehouse and Miss Selfridge. The Barclay brothers provided much of the financial firepower. </p> <p>Mr Regan intends to keep his head down until his disagreement with the serious fraud office is settled. Then, friends hint, he could be interested in looking at undervalued businesses such as the bombed out brewing and pubs sector. </p> <p>Mr Vincent, who turned 40 last week, and Mr Levett still trade the metals market. After moving to Monaco he spent a financially bruising few years as owner of Richmond rugby club. Last summer he threw in the towel and wrote off a \u00a35m loan the club owed him. His current interests include the Hotel de Vin chain, a partnership with Body Shop founders Anita and Gordon Roddick, and, inevitably, some internet investments. </p> <p>That Monaco is just over an hour's flight from London and a helicopter ride from Geneva, Rome and Paris is an added bonus. \"Monaco is a phenomenal base from which to travel,\" said one financier who spends almost as much time in the air as he does at home. </p> <p>But it is not everyone's idea of the perfect place to bring up children. \"I don't want my kids growing up thinking every parent drives a Porsche or a Ferrari and Prada are the only people who make school satchels,\" one businessman said. Instead his children are being educated at leading public schools in the Home Counties. </p> <p><strong> Attracted attention</strong></p> <p> Mr Regan has certainly attracted the Mon\u00e9gasque authorities' attention - the presence of a fugitive from the serious fraud office does little for the area's reputation. Friends of his admit that \"discussions have taken place\" involving Prince Albert himself on the issue of whether he should be allowed to remain. They say simply that the prince has \"taken a view\" on the case. </p> <p>One associate of Mr Regan remarked: \"They don't like foreign authorities here and they certainly don't like the UK authorities. The only ones who carry any weight are the French - they inevitably have some power.\" </p> <p>For now Mr Regan is taking a low profile, ferrying his kids too and from the local school, eating takeaways at the homes of friends and keeping out of the limelight. Others, like Philip Green, enjoy Monaco to the full. </p> <p>On a typical afternoon in the casino square last week, three Ferraris were parked alongside a purple Lamborghini, a gold Rolls-Royce and host of BMWs and Mercedes. Philip Green's wife Christina had left her blue Bentley Azure outside the Hotel de Paris. Her husband is reputed to moor one of the largest yachts in the harbour. Immacutely reconstructed women walk perfectly groomed dogs from the shops to the caf\u00e9s, Valentino and Gucci bags in hand. </p> <p>In the spring, a common pastime is to take an 18-minute helicopter ride up to the mountains on the Italian border for a morning's skiing, then nip back down to the coast for an afternoon of waterskiing in the sunshine. </p> <p>Each year, another clutch of names emerges from Monaco. The latest is Fred Woollard - an Australian businessman who is masterminding an attempt to \"carpetbag\" Standard Life. By forcing a vote on demutualisation, he reckons he could trigger windfalls of up to \u00a36,000 for each of the insurance group's 2.3m policyholders. Mr Woollard, 37, has been living in Monaco since 1991 but says he is not part of the British-dominated \"Monaco mob\". </p> <p>He says: \"I occasionally see them in restaurants. But the Standard Life plan was hatched by me sitting by myself with a laptop, reading boring documents.\" </p> <p>Mr Woollard claims that \"the tax angle\" has never been his primary motivation for living in the city-state - a statement which puts him firmly in a minority. He insists: \"Monaco's a really lovely place to live - the streets are clean, there's low crime and it's one of the few places you can feel totally safe.\" </p> <p>The other reason, which nobody mentions, is that Monaco is becoming an excellent place to network. </p> <p>Mr Woollard says he does not frequent millionaire haunts such as the Caf\u00e9 de Paris or Rampoldis. \"That's not my style,\" he says. \"I'm sadly a rather boring character who works too hard and spends too much time with my family.\"</p>",

Mr Levett lives down the hill in an apartment block on a wide boulevard called Avenue de Princesse Grace. Just a gear change from the grand prix track it enjoys panoramic views over the sea. Mr Levett was cleared by the authorities after an investigation into the Winchester Commodities copper scandal five years ago. His business partner at the time was Charlie \"Copperfingers\" Vincent, another Monaco resident who still deals on the copper market. Further along Avenue de Princesse Grace is a block called Houston Palace, home to another clutch of former City names including Ronnie Reeves - best known for selling investment business Eastern &amp; General to Legal &amp; General for \u00a3150m in the 1980s. Mr Reeves is a friend of Gary Amos, a broker still active on the London market who is famed for the shrewd timing of his deals. The most popular drinking venue on the Avenue de Princess Grace is Sass Caf\u00e9, a strange mixture of cabaret, disco and a band playing Abba covers. There the Brits mingle with a steady stream of Italian and Middle Eastern businessmen, grand prix drivers and ageing pop stars. Prince Albert, heir to the throne, occasionally drops in with a date. Besides the sun and low taxes, businessmen generally list security as the state's biggest asset. It is said that if you were to drop your wallet in the street it would be handed in at the local police station, complete with contents, within minutes. At Jimmy'z, Monaco's biggest and most popular nightspot, there is not a single bouncer on the door, just a glamorous female attendant taking entrance money. Low-grade crime is simply not an issue. Monaco has more police per head than any other country in the world - one bored policeman for every 67 residents. Discreet closed-circuit television cameras monitor many of the public areas, even phone calls are routinely monitored. It's the way the wealthy like it. One British resident says: \"You don't have to keep looking over your shoulder. You don't stand out here if you're a millionaire - the next man along could be a billionaire.\" There are few signs of the social exclusion that dogs other capitalist nations. The poor are discouraged through a series of strict, often authoritarian, rules. Walking shirtless on is prohibited and begging on the daily-scrubbed streets is unheard of. \"People think nothing of walking around in fur coasts and diamond neck laces that would make them an instant target in Nice or Cannes,\" one resident said. \"Being stopped by the police and asked for identity papers can be a pain but at least it's safe.\" However, just a short walk from the exclusive Hotel de Paris stands a grim reminder that even a fabulously wealthy police state can breed paranoia. The burnt out remains of the harbourside home of the late billionaire banker Edmond Safra are surrounded by scaffolding. Last December a fire gutted the building and suffocated the founder of Republic Bank of New York. The tragedy shook Monaco to the core, particularly because Safra was obsessive about security. When they saw the building alight, many paranoid millionaires rushed for the phone to check that their funds were safe in the bank downstairs. Initial rumours that the Russian mafiosi who populated Monaco for a while in the mid 1990s were to blame fuelled the sense of unease. But the police soon announced that a member of Safra's staff had confessed to starting the fire. Some of Monaco's more paranoid residents whisper that the manservant was not wholly responsible. A younger breed of British entrepreneurs is moving to the principality and Monaco doesn't want to lose them. Some Britons - such as multi-millionaire tax avoidance expert Michael Charlton - have been in Monaco for decades but a recent influx of younger tax exiles has pushed up the profile of the place. Part of the reason has been a relaxation in attitude on the part of the government. Mr Charlton says: \"They used to be quite sniffy if you turned up and said you were 37-years-old and retired. But they've eased up a lot on that - I think they realised there was a need for a more youthful population.\" The basic requirements for residence are that applicants have no criminal record, are not bankrupt and can support themselves. Residency requires that people live in Monaco for at least half the time, entitling them to an entirely tax-free lifestyle, other than paying hefty VAT in the shops. Until recently a popular ruse was to rent an apartment in Monaco but spend most of your time across the French border in your cliff-top villa at Antibes or Cap Ferrat, but a clampdown by French authorities has greatly reduced the number of people flouting Monaco's residency rules. The demographics of the British expatriates are changing. A decade ago most of the British residents had made their money and were moving south to put their feet up. But the likes of Messrs Regan, Tucker, Green and Levett are still working hard and playing an active role back in the UK. The exact nature of most of their plans remain sketchy. A typical response is: \"I'm investing in a few dot.com companies but then, aren't we all?\" Others will only admit they have \"interests\" which they would rather keep private. When they do reluctantly say what they are doing it is usually on a strictly \"off the record\" basis. Of those plans that are in the public domain, Stephen Tucker is finalising plans to take control of Storehouse, the retailing group, and he emerged recently as the main backer of New Capital Invest - an AIM-listed internet vehicle. Philip Green pops up with regular retail deals - his last big coup was buying and breaking up Sears, the owner of Freemans, Warehouse and Miss Selfridge. The Barclay brothers provided much of the financial firepower. Mr Regan intends to keep his head down until his disagreement with the serious fraud office is settled. Then, friends hint, he could be interested in looking at undervalued businesses such as the bombed out brewing and pubs sector. Mr Vincent, who turned 40 last week, and Mr Levett still trade the metals market. After moving to Monaco he spent a financially bruising few years as owner of Richmond rugby club. Last summer he threw in the towel and wrote off a \u00a35m loan the club owed him. His current interests include the Hotel de Vin chain, a partnership with Body Shop founders Anita and Gordon Roddick, and, inevitably, some internet investments. That Monaco is just over an hour's flight from London and a helicopter ride from Geneva, Rome and Paris is an added bonus. \"Monaco is a phenomenal base from which to travel,\" said one financier who spends almost as much time in the air as he does at home. But it is not everyone's idea of the perfect place to bring up children. \"I don't want my kids growing up thinking every parent drives a Porsche or a Ferrari and Prada are the only people who make school satchels,\" one businessman said. Instead his children are being educated at leading public schools in the Home Counties. Attracted attention Mr Regan has certainly attracted the Mon\u00e9gasque authorities' attention - the presence of a fugitive from the serious fraud office does little for the area's reputation. Friends of his admit that \"discussions have taken place\" involving Prince Albert himself on the issue of whether he should be allowed to remain. They say simply that the prince has \"taken a view\" on the case. One associate of Mr Regan remarked: \"They don't like foreign authorities here and they certainly don't like the UK authorities. The only ones who carry any weight are the French - they inevitably have some power.\" For now Mr Regan is taking a low profile, ferrying his kids too and from the local school, eating takeaways at the homes of friends and keeping out of the limelight. Others, like Philip Green, enjoy Monaco to the full. On a typical afternoon in the casino square last week, three Ferraris were parked alongside a purple Lamborghini, a gold Rolls-Royce and host of BMWs and Mercedes. Philip Green's wife Christina had left her blue Bentley Azure outside the Hotel de Paris. Her husband is reputed to moor one of the largest yachts in the harbour. Immacutely reconstructed women walk perfectly groomed dogs from the shops to the caf\u00e9s, Valentino and Gucci bags in hand. In the spring, a common pastime is to take an 18-minute helicopter ride up to the mountains on the Italian border for a morning's skiing, then nip back down to the coast for an afternoon of waterskiing in the sunshine. Each year, another clutch of names emerges from Monaco. The latest is Fred Woollard - an Australian businessman who is masterminding an attempt to \"carpetbag\" Standard Life. By forcing a vote on demutualisation, he reckons he could trigger windfalls of up to \u00a36,000 for each of the insurance group's 2.3m policyholders. Mr Woollard, 37, has been living in Monaco since 1991 but says he is not part of the British-dominated \"Monaco mob\". He says: \"I occasionally see them in restaurants. But the Standard Life plan was hatched by me sitting by myself with a laptop, reading boring documents.\" Mr Woollard claims that \"the tax angle\" has never been his primary motivation for living in the city-state - a statement which puts him firmly in a minority. He insists: \"Monaco's a really lovely place to live - the streets are clean, there's low crime and it's one of the few places you can feel totally safe.\" The other reason, which nobody mentions, is that Monaco is becoming an excellent place to network. Mr Woollard says he does not frequent millionaire haunts such as the Caf\u00e9 de Paris or Rampoldis. \"That's not my style,\" he says. \"I'm sadly a rather boring character who works too hard and spends too much time with my family.\"",

Border has long been considered a takeover target and Chrysalis, Capital Radio, Kelvin Mackenzie's Wireless group and Scottish Media Group are all understood to have come forward. There is speculation that Guardian Media Group, publisher of the Guardian newspaper and employer of Border's former radio chief John Myers has also taken a long look at the company. </p> <p>For each of the likely bidders the key at traction is Border's radio assets - a market where advertising revenues are forecast to grow at between 10%-13% this year. Border has four stations, including three on air under the Century brand and Sun FM in Sunderland, which together have a potential audience of 9.2m adults and are regarded as some of the most potentially lucrative franchises in the country. </p> <p>About 40% of Border's revenues come from radio, up from 20% two years ago. \"There's plenty more growth to come,\" Mr Corley said in rejecting the bid. \"Scottish Radio is a very good company but their stations are all mature businesses. Our north-west station is the biggest outside London and has been up for only 18 months.\" </p> <p>Although a minnow compared to the big three ITV groups of Granada, United News &amp; Media and Carlton, Border is consistently among the best performing regions and has an average market share in peak time of 43% compared with the 38% of the rest of the networks. </p> <p>Its influence as a programme maker has waned. Throughout the 1980s under Melvyn Bragg and when Mr Corley was director of programming, Border was still an active producer for the ITV network. The growing firepower of the big three and the introduction of a quota on the amount of airtime which has to be filled by independent producers has however squeezed Border out. Today it produces just between five and six hours a week, largely of local news. </p> <p>The station has an agreement with Granada to supply transmission and national advertising sales. </p> <p>Border's origins though could still play a decisive part in the outcome of what is likely to develop into a bidding war. The Border TV business, which reaches its 40th birthday next year, came into being only on the intervention of a group of local media barons when the old Indepen dent Television Association was carving the nation up. </p> <p>The Border region was to have been subsumed into the surrounding conurbations but they argued the case for a separate franchise focusing on the largely rural borders between England and Scotland, Cumbria and the Isle of Man. The CN Group, then run by the late Sir John Burgess, was one of the Border founders and remains one of its largest shareholders with a stake just below 14%. </p> <p>The timing of Scottish Radio's bid is significant. The group is up against a consortium of Border, Chrysalis and Daily Mail &amp; General Trust for the valuable second digital radio multiplex in London. Each multiplex can support eight stations one of which would introduce the Century brand to London. </p> <p>Border's position in that contest also increases the stakes for Chrysalis which insiders say is keen not to lose its partner in the process to an opposing bidder. </p> <p>Richard Findlay, chief executive of Scottish Radio, suggests his group has better depth of experience through its 15 radio stations and calls on Border to be \"realistic\" about its future independence. \"They have to accept that the media world is changing and if they want to survive they have to be part of a bigger group. They will lose their independence at some point and we hope they will talk to us because we have more to bring to the party than another buyer.\" </p> <p>Mr Corley's argument that there is more value to come was borne out by the performance of the group's shares since Scottish Radio made an aborted offer two years ago at \u00a34 a share. </p> <p>Scottish Radio's present bid is 10 shares for every 17 in Border, at yesterday's prices about \u00a311 a share, or a cash alternative of \u00a310.25. </p> <p>Despite Mr Corley's insistence that the company wants to keep its freedom it's hard to escape the sense that the Border directors are simply fattening the turkey. A key argument is that the upcoming Broadcasting Act is likely to lift limits on both radio and ITV ownership making Border a target for a broader base of potential buyers and adding to its value.</p>",

Its influence as a programme maker has waned. Throughout the 1980s under Melvyn Bragg and when Mr Corley was director of programming, Border was still an active producer for the ITV network. The growing firepower of the big three and the introduction of a quota on the amount of airtime which has to be filled by independent producers has however squeezed Border out. Today it produces just between five and six hours a week, largely of local news. The station has an agreement with Granada to supply transmission and national advertising sales. Border's origins though could still play a decisive part in the outcome of what is likely to develop into a bidding war. The Border TV business, which reaches its 40th birthday next year, came into being only on the intervention of a group of local media barons when the old Indepen dent Television Association was carving the nation up. The Border region was to have been subsumed into the surrounding conurbations but they argued the case for a separate franchise focusing on the largely rural borders between England and Scotland, Cumbria and the Isle of Man. The CN Group, then run by the late Sir John Burgess, was one of the Border founders and remains one of its largest shareholders with a stake just below 14%. The timing of Scottish Radio's bid is significant. The group is up against a consortium of Border, Chrysalis and Daily Mail &amp; General Trust for the valuable second digital radio multiplex in London. Each multiplex can support eight stations one of which would introduce the Century brand to London. Border's position in that contest also increases the stakes for Chrysalis which insiders say is keen not to lose its partner in the process to an opposing bidder. Richard Findlay, chief executive of Scottish Radio, suggests his group has better depth of experience through its 15 radio stations and calls on Border to be \"realistic\" about its future independence. \"They have to accept that the media world is changing and if they want to survive they have to be part of a bigger group. They will lose their independence at some point and we hope they will talk to us because we have more to bring to the party than another buyer.\" Mr Corley's argument that there is more value to come was borne out by the performance of the group's shares since Scottish Radio made an aborted offer two years ago at \u00a34 a share. Scottish Radio's present bid is 10 shares for every 17 in Border, at yesterday's prices about \u00a311 a share, or a cash alternative of \u00a310.25. Despite Mr Corley's insistence that the company wants to keep its freedom it's hard to escape the sense that the Border directors are simply fattening the turkey. A key argument is that the upcoming Broadcasting Act is likely to lift limits on both radio and ITV ownership making Border a target for a broader base of potential buyers and adding to its value.",

      "body": "<p>British art is currently languishing in obscurity, sustained by little more than the opening of two new Tate galleries and countless newspaper articles. Young artists toiling in garrets are hurting; attention must be paid. And so the launch of Beck's Futures, a new British art prize with more money and a bigger shortlist than the Turner, is a necessary intervention in an art scene dying for want of limelight. When you add that Beck's Futures is at the ICA, which refuses to engage in shallow cultural rhetoric, you just know this is an event destined to wield authority. </p> <p>Beck's Futures is not just any prize, but one that claims to define the new wave in British art. Again. The ICA wants to displace the Turner Prize as Britain's definitive art event. The Turner, it claims, is given to people who are already established. Beck's Futures is for genuinely new, unestablished or under-recognised figures. It has a shortlist of 10 and everyone will get some money, while the ultimate winner gets \u00a324,000 - \u00a34,000 more than the Turner booty. Instead of being pitted against each other in separate spaces like the Turner nominees, the artists in this show are hung together in a complementary fashion. It's less aggressive, man, and more in tune with the way artists collaborate when they organise group shows. </p> <p>Michael Bracewell's catalogue essay is a manifesto claiming these artists represent the post-YBA new wave. They epitomise a tendency in art you might call Ostentatious Nerdism, if you were desperate. The 10 shortlisted artists all vaunt a contempt for the starriness they ascribe to the YBAs. They dress down, talk quietly, are dowdy, studious. </p> <p>The quintessential artist of this tendency is Martin Boyce. His arrangement of fluorescent lights hang vertically from the ceiling as you come in, the chains that are supposed to suspend the white tubes dangling free. At first I thought a beer-sodden ligger had pulled a light down. Then you realise it is abstract art. It is a homage to the De Stijl movement of which Mondrian was a part, and is titled After Rietveld, a tribute to the De Stijl designer Gerrit Rietveld. </p> <p>This Dutch modernist movement dreamt of a world where material forms dissolved in abstract space. Boyce has made a lament for that dream. In the ICA corridor he has painted a spectacular black and white slanting grid, like the skyscraper windows in the opening titles of Hitchcock's North by Northwest. This is art for the Bauhaus groupie who spends Sundays looking for the perfect Marcel Breuer chair. </p> <p>Boyce will come close to the big prize. His work is a nicely expressed elegy for modernism, but so what? It's all very well making art that presses buttons for people who know about Gerrit Rietveld, but the best British art of the past 10 years has been determined to engage people who don't - most of us. This is not shallow, it's courageous. </p> <p>The trouble with Beck's Futures is that it seems to be rejecting big brash art for art about art. I love Liz Arnold's paintings - naive from a distance, sophisticated about pictorial space close up - but put a gun to my head and I have to admit I feel clever for saying so. The other shortlisted painter, 22-year-old Lucy McKenzie, has a slight student insecurity as she revisits the pop art of Gerhard Richter. More quotation, more nostalgia. </p> <p>When you get to Hayley Newman - along with Martin Boyce, one of the show's most impressive artists - you're wallowing in history. Newman is someone you are never likely to see in the Turner; in fact, you'll be hard pressed to see her at the ICA. She is a performance artist. On the walls she shows photographs of her performances, such as when she hid in a black bin bag in an alley in New York, running away, she tells us, when the binmen arrived. </p> <p>It takes a moment to realise this is a joke. Newman's work debunks the idea that pervades performance art, from Californian artist Chris Burden being shot to Joseph Beuys explaining art to a dead hare: the idea of the authentic self-expression of the artist. The performance she gives at the ICA takes this to extraordinary levels of irony. Dressed in oddly middle-aged clothes, she piles up toy cows, glasses, shoes, all kinds of stuff on two metal plates connected to a sound-sampling machine programmed to respond to the objects' weight. I love shoes, sings a recorded voice; when she sets out her toy animals, you hear Baa Baa Black Sheep. The performance has no centre to it; there is no authenticity here, just cyborg-like activity. </p> <p>Hayley Newman is a fascinating artist, but she plays art games. Her photographs are funnier the more history of art you know. She addresses an audience of netheads, cultural theorists; her catalogue bibliography mainly lists websites. </p> <p>What's worrying about British art now is that it seems to be losing sight of other forms, other cultural practices, and to be so enjoying its routines of mutual flattery that it forgets the need to compete with all the strangeness in the world. It's funny to see Elizabeth Wright's oddly-scaled objects. She makes perfect replicas of everyday things, except slightly too big or too small. They catch you unawares and undermine everyday reality. Out in the carpark, visible through a window, is a battered green Mini that's a little too big, parked next to a normal-sized Escort. You watch through the window as others walk past, stop, scratch their heads and return to examine it more closely. </p> <p>Great, but Spike Jonze's Being John Malkovich has an entire floor of a skyscraper whose ceilings are four feet high. Wright's art is cod surrealism that you can get bigger and better in the movies. In a different way, Roddy Buchanan's video Gobstopper, in which a succession of children try to hold their breath as he drives them through the Clyde tunnel, is an engaging but unambitious exploration of Glasgow childhood compared with Lynne Ramsay's film Ratcatcher. You start to wonder what's so special about British art. </p> <p>Just as you are getting suspicious, you come across an artist who seems equally sceptical. David Shrigley's drawings and collages hang in an anal cluster of frames in one corner and amount to a parodic little exhibition within the exhibition. A blurred photograph is scrawled with a felt pen message in which the author explains how much silence he needs to write his poetry. You must respect this, he explains, if you are to stay here while your house is being rebuilt. </p> <p>This is art anyone can enjoy. Shrigley is a clever, mordant comic whose cartoon books are cult reading. One of them is called Why We Got the Sack From the Museum. Another juxtaposes lists of \"What should have held your attention\", including an \"amazing firework display lasting for hours\" and \"Citizen Kane\", with \"What did hold your attention\", including a \"clothes peg hanging from a piece of string\" and \"old carpet\". </p> <p>Shrigley is the best-known artist on the Beck's Futures shortlist and his presence mocks the claim to iden tify a new generation. He trained in public art at Glasgow School of Art and has the ambition that characterises the best current British art. He also has an anger. He photographs a derelict Glasgow wasteland with a pathetic upturned cardboard box that says LEISURE CENTRE. His art imagines the big public sculptures he might one day make, but won't. A text complains that people see the city planning officer as a monster, but he's a civilised man who likes to eat octopus because they are the most human creatures in the sea. </p> <p>It would be great to say David Shrigley is overrated, that he's less good than the unknown Lucy McKenzie or whoever, but it would be stupid. If the ICA want this prize to succeed they should shortlist more artists of this stature and intelligence who are a bit too maverick for the Turner, instead of trying to map out some grand theory of the next big thing. If they want to be taken seriously, they have to give this year's prize to the one artist who addresses a world beyond the little one we set aside for \"art\". </p> <p>David Shrigley doesn't care if his work appears on a gallery wall or in a newspaper (as it happens, the newspaper that sponsors Beck's Futures has just sacked him as a cartoonist). He's a conceptual artist: he draws with a beautiful, clear line yet it's his ideas that take on a physical weight. A photograph in the ICA show has a waste bin in a flat surrounded by crumpled paper. A collaged cut-out skeleton looms out of the bin - the corpse of dead ideas. Another photomontage suggests some terrible chaos and disaster you can't quite name: it includes a house on fire, a bulldog grimacing, and a sunflower with a sad face drawn on it. Shrigley is brilliant. He keeps to these homely, recognisable images of horror. Your house is on fire. Your art is rubbish. </p> <p>\u0095 Beck's Futures is at the ICA, London SW7 (0171-930 3647), till May 17.</p>",

Out in the carpark, visible through a window, is a battered green Mini that's a little too big, parked next to a normal-sized Escort. You watch through the window as others walk past, stop, scratch their heads and return to examine it more closely. Great, but Spike Jonze's Being John Malkovich has an entire floor of a skyscraper whose ceilings are four feet high. Wright's art is cod surrealism that you can get bigger and better in the movies. In a different way, Roddy Buchanan's video Gobstopper, in which a succession of children try to hold their breath as he drives them through the Clyde tunnel, is an engaging but unambitious exploration of Glasgow childhood compared with Lynne Ramsay's film Ratcatcher. You start to wonder what's so special about British art. Just as you are getting suspicious, you come across an artist who seems equally sceptical. David Shrigley's drawings and collages hang in an anal cluster of frames in one corner and amount to a parodic little exhibition within the exhibition. A blurred photograph is scrawled with a felt pen message in which the author explains how much silence he needs to write his poetry. You must respect this, he explains, if you are to stay here while your house is being rebuilt. This is art anyone can enjoy. Shrigley is a clever, mordant comic whose cartoon books are cult reading. One of them is called Why We Got the Sack From the Museum. Another juxtaposes lists of \"What should have held your attention\", including an \"amazing firework display lasting for hours\" and \"Citizen Kane\", with \"What did hold your attention\", including a \"clothes peg hanging from a piece of string\" and \"old carpet\". Shrigley is the best-known artist on the Beck's Futures shortlist and his presence mocks the claim to iden tify a new generation. He trained in public art at Glasgow School of Art and has the ambition that characterises the best current British art. He also has an anger. He photographs a derelict Glasgow wasteland with a pathetic upturned cardboard box that says LEISURE CENTRE. His art imagines the big public sculptures he might one day make, but won't. A text complains that people see the city planning officer as a monster, but he's a civilised man who likes to eat octopus because they are the most human creatures in the sea. It would be great to say David Shrigley is overrated, that he's less good than the unknown Lucy McKenzie or whoever, but it would be stupid. If the ICA want this prize to succeed they should shortlist more artists of this stature and intelligence who are a bit too maverick for the Turner, instead of trying to map out some grand theory of the next big thing. If they want to be taken seriously, they have to give this year's prize to the one artist who addresses a world beyond the little one we set aside for \"art\". David Shrigley doesn't care if his work appears on a gallery wall or in a newspaper (as it happens, the newspaper that sponsors Beck's Futures has just sacked him as a cartoonist). He's a conceptual artist: he draws with a beautiful, clear line yet it's his ideas that take on a physical weight. A photograph in the ICA show has a waste bin in a flat surrounded by crumpled paper. A collaged cut-out skeleton looms out of the bin - the corpse of dead ideas. Another photomontage suggests some terrible chaos and disaster you can't quite name: it includes a house on fire, a bulldog grimacing, and a sunflower with a sad face drawn on it. Shrigley is brilliant. He keeps to these homely, recognisable images of horror. Your house is on fire. Your art is rubbish. \u0095 Beck's Futures is at the ICA, London SW7 (0171-930 3647), till May 17.",

Both have come to the classics from the world of physical theatre.

When she played Leka in Mr Deka D you wanted to hug this woman who weeps today for the unhappiness that will happen tomorrow. </p> <p>Playing the mute Kattrin holds no fears: her background in physical theatre means she's spent years on stage not saying very much. \"If I had a doubt in my mind, it was that I might be going into too familiar territory: would it be challenging?

      "body": "<p>Diana Rigg once famously described Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage as \"a female Lear with songs\" and, like Lear, it is a role that attracts performers of a certain age and a definite star quality. Other great names associated with it are Judi Dench, Glenda Jackson and now Kathryn Hunter. But then, if you are a star actress and want to tackle a demanding role, you may as well choose a play by Bertolt Brecht. The inventor of \"epic theatre\" was the first modern playwright to give women big leading roles, many written for his wife, Helene Weigel. And Mother Courage is certainly a big role - the actress playing her is offstage for only one of the 12 scenes, and she must pull a cart around for much of her time on it. And she has to sing. </p> <p>Brecht wrote Mother Courage and Her Children in 1939 while living in exile in Denmark after fleeing Nazi Germany. It follows the travails of Mother Courage, who sells her wares from her famous cart to soldiers and camp followers during the Thirty Years' War - the conflict that devastated central Europe during the first half of the 17th century - and who changes sides (from Protestant to Catholic) at least twice. It is an allegory of the horrors of modern war, and makes clear the complicity of many characters who are caught up in it. Mother Courage is in no way an innocent onlooker - on the contrary, she makes a living from the conflict. Yet by the end of the drama that she is transformed into a victim of the war, having lost her three beloved children to it in various ways. </p> <p>It is easy to see why Mother Courage is such a tough part. How do you make an audience empathise with this appalling woman without making it sentimental? The only one of the list to have tackled both King Lear and Mother Courage is Hunter, who did an acclaimed Lear in 1997 and is about to star in Lee Hall's version of Mother Courage in Oxford. Is she a glutton for punishment? \"It's another very big role, yes, but the good thing about Lear is that it didn't have many props,\" says Hunter, despairing at all the stage business that must be done with Mother Courage's cart and its contents. \"But Brecht, much like Shakespeare, does ask you to find the tragedy and high farce and to be able to move very deftly between the two.\" </p> <p>Does she agree with Rigg's Lear parallel? \"There's not the journey towards madness that happens in Lear, but at the end when she has lost her three children, something snaps. There's certainly that huge emotion, but the hardest task is serving Brecht. He doesn't want her presented as a heroine, yet what he has written calls for empathy. </p> <p>\"There is this constant pull between her wanting to be the best mother in the world and get her three children through the war unscathed, but also wanting to be the best businesswoman in the world and make as much money from it as possible. The two strategies are incompatible and that clash has to be operating all the time.\" </p> <p>Why has she taken it on? \"I like the challenge and it is a mountain to be climbed.\" Is it an Everest for actresses, then - it's there, so they have to climb it? \"Yes, perhaps,\" says Hunter. \"I had always had a fantasy about playing it, and when [director Nancy Meckler] proposed it I was delighted. But the basic reason for doing it is that Brecht is the most extraordinary dramatist.\" </p> <p>While Rigg and Hunter can see the Lear parallel, Glenda Jackson doesn't entirely agree. The actress- turned MP made the role her swan song from the stage before she entered politics, performing it at the Glasgow Citizens in 1990. \"It's a huge role - you're in practically every bloody scene - but I'm not quite sure it has the range of Lear. Although I suppose the great emotions, in that she is passionate about her children and suffers great loss, might suggest that. The challenge for the actor, though, is trying to not make her heroic. That was not Brecht's idea at all.\" </p> <p>Although all the actresses agree that the role should be within the range of a talented young actress, Rigg believes that it's one, like Lear, that only middle age can fully illuminate. \"Mother Courage's age is never stated, but she has three grown children, so she must be at least 40. She has clearly lived a long time,\" says Rigg. \"I did it in my mid-50s and it's that 'encrustation' that comes with living a few years that informs the part.\" </p> <p>When Rigg played Mother Courage at the National in 1995, part of the attraction was the chance to overturn standard perceptions of her. \"I have this image as a rather grand leading lady, and I came on stage as a working-class woman with broad Yorkshire vowels. David Hare [who did the adaptation] knew I come from Yorkshire, so he decided to use that.\" </p> <p>Rigg's performance was described as Bet Lynch-meets-Marxist dialectic and she clearly had fun in what is regarded as A Very Serious Play. \"The humour is there; it just needs to be brought out. I must say it was a joy to do, but bloody hard work - pulling that blessed cart around for three hours every night.\" </p> <p>Judi Dench played the role with the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1984. She wasn't aware of these details when she took the part, which she accepted without even reading the script - as is her practice - relying on Brecht's reputation for writing great roles for women. \"When the director, Howard Davies, told me the story of Mother Courage, he didn't tell me she was on stage so much and he didn't tell me I had to pull round this enormous cart. So on the first day of rehearsal I thought, 'Fuck this. I never have a scene off.' I was so angry. But it was my own stupid fault, of course.\" </p> <p>While Rigg enjoyed playing with her image, Jackson was just grateful for a part to get her teeth into. \"God knows, there are few enough roles for women anyway, but ones this good are exceedingly rare. And this is a great role in a great play. It's a popular myth that there are great roles in lousy play - there aren't, quite simply. I feel privileged to have played her.\" </p> <p>Hunter, meanwhile, is still getting to grips with the role, but is heartened when I say I have an interesting anecdote to pass on from the MP. \"Helene Weigel said she based her characterisation of Mother Courage on Broadway singer Ethel Merman - it was that big, blousy aspect that attracted her. I personally found that an illuminating way to get into the role.\" </p> <p>\"Ah,\" says Hunter. \"That's fascinating. I wonder what she meant. But I've still got a mountain to climb.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Mother Courage and Her Children is at Oxford Playhouse (01865 798600) from today, then at Brighton, Leeds and Sheffield before opening at New Ambassadors, London WC2 (0171-836 6111), on April 25.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Despite the controversy which surrounded the work at the time of its premiere, Anthony Payne's completion of Elgar's Third Symphony (or \"Elaboration of the Sketches\", to use Payne's own phrase) has won a permanent place in the repertory - so much so, that Elgar's other symphonies have tended to slip from view of late.</p> <p>It's already been recorded twice. Many British conductors have championed the work. American Elgarian Leonard Slatkin conducted the New York premiere last year.

      "bodyText": "Despite the controversy which surrounded the work at the time of its premiere, Anthony Payne's completion of Elgar's Third Symphony (or \"Elaboration of the Sketches\", to use Payne's own phrase) has won a permanent place in the repertory - so much so, that Elgar's other symphonies have tended to slip from view of late. It's already been recorded twice. Many British conductors have championed the work. American Elgarian Leonard Slatkin conducted the New York premiere last year. This was his first performance of it in the UK. Having presented Payne with honorary membership of the Royal Philharmonic Society, Slatkin gave us an interpretation which was predictably different from many we've heard before, though equally valid.

People buying homes in London and the south east will be worst hit by the move, which is designed to cool down the booming housing market without the Chancellor raising interest rates. Savings There was good news for investors as Gordon Brown announced that the \u00a37,000 allowance for Individual savings accounts (Isas) will remain for the new financial year in April 2000 to 2001. When Isas were launched last year the Chancellor announced the allowance would fall to \u00a35,000.

However, savers wanting to put their funds into a mini cash Isa will now be able to salt away \u00a33,000 from April. The cash limit was to have dropped to \u00a31,000. Child benefit Parents should receive a cash boost thanks to a shake-up in child benefits. Child Benefit will rise to \u00a315.50 from April next year. The \u00a328 weekly ceiling will be raised to \u00a350. Poorer families will also be given an extra \u00a34.35 a week through the Working Families and Disabled Person's Tax Credits. There will be a further cash injection of \u00a38.50 a week in a new Children's Tax Credit scheme launched in April 2001. The moves are designed to bring families with one child and one person in work up to the \u00a3214 a week minimum guaranteed income by April next year.",
