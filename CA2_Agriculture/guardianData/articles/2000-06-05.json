Merrill Lynch predicts that, by 2005, Bluetooth, a name derived from a King of Denmark who was famed for getting people to talk to each other, will be found in 1.7bn electronic devices around the globe. The technology's main selling point is that it does away with the jumble of wires and adaptors that many mobile phone users have to wrestle with.

Its backers are claiming that the technology will eventually be found in devices ranging from the PC to the fridge, but one of the first gadgets to get the Bluetooth treatment will be the mobile phone.

The whom is likely to give him fewer headaches than the how. </p> <p>The line-up is all but decided.

Josif Ilic, the Malta coach, used 11 substitutes and even Keegan brought on six. At times it was like watching a game at Clapham Junction. </p> <p>Some England players enhanced their importance for Euro 2000 by not appearing.

While no wise person would judge the team's prospects for Euro 2000 solely on the evidence of a social occasion designed, from the Football Association's point of view, to secure Malta's vote for hosting the 2006 World Cup, the shortcomings in Keegan's side were alarmingly consistent with those that had plagued England's narrow squeak in qualifying. </p> <p>As Keegan himself said afterwards: \"If we play like that in Euro 2000 we'll be home early. We missed a lot of chances and we need to work on the defence as a unit. Too often we were beaten by simple balls lobbed over the top, although of course there is Tony Adams to come back. He's a key player for us.\" </p> <p>Adams, however, is unlikely to go through the tournament without suffering some sort of ache or strain. Keegan's confidence in Martin Keown and Sol Campbell is unshaken although again on Saturday Campbell appeared to be suffering from a loss of form and confidence. </p> <p>At times the ease with which Carmel Bussutil, the stocky 36-year-old Malta captain, lured the Tottenham defender into tackles, then turned inside him with the ball was embarrassing; and the penalty given away by Richard Wright, England's third-choice goalkeeper, which enabled the Maltese to draw level six minutes after Keown had headed in a free-kick from David Beckham, followed one of several instances in which Malta exploited space to the left of goal covered by neither Campbell nor Phil Neville. </p> <p>Both went missing as Noel Turner found David Carabott, who was then fouled by Wright. Carabott sent the goalkeeper the wrong way with a penalty which then had to be re-taken because of Maltese encroachment. This time the ball hit a post and rebounded into the net off Wright's head, almost a comic remake of the goal he had conceded playing for Ipswich against Barnsley in the First Division play-off final. </p> <p>As at Wembley, however, Wright made amends, this time saving another penalty from Carabott in the 88th minute to deny Malta a 2-2 draw. In stoppage time, moreover, Wright saved feet first to thwart Nenad Veselji, the man he had brought down for the second penalty. There is nothing wrong with Wright's agility or his handling but prospective England goalkeepers should not be conceding two penalties in one game. </p> <p>Barmby was the one bright spot in an otherwise grey England performance. \"He played very well,\" said Keegan. \"He's a talented footballer with a good football brain.\" Certainly the Everton man has the intelligence at this level not to attempt ambitious dribbles past defenders or intricately threaded passes when the situation demands a simple ball. </p> <p>Speed, simplicity, vision and the ability to pass, centre or shoot with either foot have always been Barmby's virtues and Keegan cannot be far off persuading himself that against Portugal the balance he would give England outweighs the fancier notion of allowing Steve McManaman to drift in from the left. </p> <p>McManaman could still be accommodated if the England coach opts for playing five across the middle. Yet Keegan still has to consider the ability of Dennis Wise, as he showed against Argentina, to get the passing together and the importance of getting Paul Scholes into scoring positions. </p> <p>Significantly, perhaps, Barmby set up England's winning goal against Malta a quarter of an hour from the end when he neatly evaded a defensive challenge to provide the short cross from the left from which Heskey scored. </p> <p>Equally significantly the 10 minutes Gareth Barry spent on the field after replacing Beckham reminded Keegan of the advantages that might accrue from having a naturally left-footed defender with attacking inclinations. </p> <p> <strong> England</strong> (4-4-2): Wright; G Neville, Keown (Southgate, 58min), Campbell, P Neville; Beckham (Barry, 80), Wise (Ince, 68), Scholes (McManaman, 68), Barmby; Shearer (Heskey, 51), Phillips (Fowler, 58).</p>",

      "body": "<b>Environment</b> <p>Environment may no longer be a core issue for New Labour, yet performance in this area explains why the government is perceived as being insufficiently radical, obsessively centralising, and an obstacle to new ideas. And why it is accused of failing to address the issues that most affect people. </p> <p>The first problem is structural. Government is organised around narrow departments, yet almost all environmental challenges require several departments to work together. We need more of that much-vaunted \"joined-up thinking\". </p> <p>There is also a cultural problem. The key government departments - trade, agriculture, environment - too often have, at their core, civil servants biased toward the old industries. They advise their political masters accordingly. We need a whole new approach. </p> <p>\u0095 <b> Renewable energy </b><br> A small group of Department of Trade and Industry civil servants has effectively strangled innovation in this area from birth. Other countries see these new markets as hi-tech and exciting but Britain pays little more than lip service. We should be following Denmark, Germany, France and the Nordic countries. They are racing ahead with research and giving tax breaks or advantages to already proven schemes. </p> <p>Too often in the past 30 years Britain has let slip its lead in innovative industries. The solar industry is growing worldwide but Britain has no coherent programme despite the fact that our two biggest oil companies want to invest in it. </p> <p>The government subsidises coal by \u00a3100m a year, yet turns its back on solar - a modern, hi-tech industry with massive local, global and export potential. We should follow other countries and commit ourselves to a programme, over 10 years, to install 100,000 solar roofs. </p> <p>\u0095 <b> Food</b><br> Britain can barely compete in today's world markets. We import huge quantities of organic food to satisfy a home market because the Ministry of Agriculture has failed to respond to the public mood. </p> <p>Competition will become harder with new global trade laws and the enlargement of the European Union - making foreign industrial scale production of cheap food easier and more obtainable to supermarkets. </p> <p>We should concentrate resources on producing high-quality foodstuffs, stimulating the organic industry to reduce prices, and employing more people in rural industries. We should commit ourselves to reaching 20% organic production within 10 years. </p> <p>On GM foods, Labour is widely perceived to be too close to global agribusiness and not to be listening to consumers. It should review its policies, and call a moratorium for two years on further plantings while evidence is reviewed. </p> <p>\u0095 <b> Nuclear power</b><br> Nuclear is no longer a strategic essential. It is known to be a big long-term drain on resources. Yet Britain is the best equipped country in the world to spearhead the clean up of nuclear material around the world. </p> <p>The government should renegotiate contracts with Japan, Germany and other overseas customers and opt for storage of nuclear fuel rather than messy reprocessing - an outdated technology supported by the government. It should invest any money it saves in renewable energies. </p> <p>\u0095 <b> Environment agency </b> <br>The agency is overstretched and lacking resources.

      "bodyText": "Environment Environment may no longer be a core issue for New Labour, yet performance in this area explains why the government is perceived as being insufficiently radical, obsessively centralising, and an obstacle to new ideas. And why it is accused of failing to address the issues that most affect people. The first problem is structural. Government is organised around narrow departments, yet almost all environmental challenges require several departments to work together. We need more of that much-vaunted \"joined-up thinking\". There is also a cultural problem. The key government departments - trade, agriculture, environment - too often have, at their core, civil servants biased toward the old industries. They advise their political masters accordingly. We need a whole new approach. \u0095 Renewable energy A small group of Department of Trade and Industry civil servants has effectively strangled innovation in this area from birth. Other countries see these new markets as hi-tech and exciting but Britain pays little more than lip service. We should be following Denmark, Germany, France and the Nordic countries. They are racing ahead with research and giving tax breaks or advantages to already proven schemes. Too often in the past 30 years Britain has let slip its lead in innovative industries. The solar industry is growing worldwide but Britain has no coherent programme despite the fact that our two biggest oil companies want to invest in it. The government subsidises coal by \u00a3100m a year, yet turns its back on solar - a modern, hi-tech industry with massive local, global and export potential. We should follow other countries and commit ourselves to a programme, over 10 years, to install 100,000 solar roofs. \u0095 Food Britain can barely compete in today's world markets. We import huge quantities of organic food to satisfy a home market because the Ministry of Agriculture has failed to respond to the public mood. Competition will become harder with new global trade laws and the enlargement of the European Union - making foreign industrial scale production of cheap food easier and more obtainable to supermarkets. We should concentrate resources on producing high-quality foodstuffs, stimulating the organic industry to reduce prices, and employing more people in rural industries. We should commit ourselves to reaching 20% organic production within 10 years. On GM foods, Labour is widely perceived to be too close to global agribusiness and not to be listening to consumers. It should review its policies, and call a moratorium for two years on further plantings while evidence is reviewed. \u0095 Nuclear power Nuclear is no longer a strategic essential. It is known to be a big long-term drain on resources. Yet Britain is the best equipped country in the world to spearhead the clean up of nuclear material around the world. The government should renegotiate contracts with Japan, Germany and other overseas customers and opt for storage of nuclear fuel rather than messy reprocessing - an outdated technology supported by the government. It should invest any money it saves in renewable energies. \u0095 Environment agency The agency is overstretched and lacking resources. It needs to be beefed up and given real powers. Pollution fines are derisory. Company directors should be made personally responsible for pollution incidents. \u0095 Planning The countryside does not need to become tarmac and concrete; estates do not have to be built on flood plains. The water supply, as well as rivers and streams, needs protection from pollution and overabstraction. Transport Labour should be realistic enough to tell the public that Britain's transport system is seizing up - and there is nothing in the short term that can be done to improve the situation. The party should admit that we live in an overcrowded island, and still our people want to travel more frequently, at home and abroad. It must try to satisfy their demand, provided that proper safety precautions are maintained. Labour should also confess that the experiment in setting up a super department covering the environment, transport and the regions has not been a success and has blurred the focus of decision making. In its next term, transport should become a separate department again. The public has been ahead of successive governments in wanting road and rail transport integrated, even as they recognise the love affair between motorist and car. No government can do much to prevent people using cars - not when official forecasts indicate that road traffic will rise by at least 75% in the next 30 years. But the government can and should be clearer on what it is trying to do with transport. It promised swift action to clear up the mistakes of its predecessors, notably on rail, but quickly discovered that big changes usually mean investment in infrastructure projects, such as modernisation of the west coast main line, rehabilitation of the London Underground or construction of the Channel tunnel rail link. Or they mean huge planning delays, such as the decision on whether to go ahead with terminal 5 at Heathrow. As a start, the government should draw up a checklist of public transport improvements to be achieved on a yearly basis, with spending details for each scheme. John Prescott, transport secretary, has suffered badly in the past three years from the Treasury's penny pinching.

These were predicated on falling passenger use, whereas use has risen by more than 25% as Britons flee the congested roads. But investment has stayed static, reflected in a deteriorating service. The next Labour government will have to maintain a reasonable level of subsidies to rail from 2002 to ensure that people are not dissuaded from using the railways.

      "bodyText": "As ministers met at Downing Street today for a summit on the health service, the British Medical Association (BMA) took the opportunity to rebuff the government's \"unnecessary attacks\" on doctors. Last week's report on the disgraced gynaecologist Rodney Ledward, who botched operations on hundreds of women but was able to continue in practice for 16 years, said that consultants were sometimes revered as \"gods\" and no one questioned their performance. Health secretary Alan Milburn promised yesterday to end such anachronisms in the NHS and fundamentally reform the service: \"What we can't have is a situation where the practices of a small minority of doctors tarnish the reputation of the whole medical profession.\" He singled out some senior doctors as among the obstacles stopping NHS modernisation.

Neither charge is accurate. The term elite is variously defined, but in practice it usually means quite simply those who have got to the top. What Mr Brown is questioning is whether some who might have got to the top in a differently ordered society have in practice been stifled by the system. It is one of the oldest questions in politics and one which always evokes the same complacent response from the forces of conservatism. The equation of existing elites with the triumph of excellence is an old and shabby device. You can trace its lineage from the reactionary clamour when in the 1850s Northcote and Trevelyan dared to suggest that civil servants should be recruited not on the basis of patronage but through competitive examination; or when army reforms put an end to the practice of buying commissions. Of course society has everywhere lightened and loosened up since those days - and especially since Wilson's call for the liberation of talent back in the 1960s. William Hague, from Wath-upon-Dearne comprehensive, is not Wilson's much savoured target, the 14th Earl of Home; Greg Dyke (Hayes Grammar) is hardly John Reith.

Today we report telling new findings from the Sutton Trust, based on admissions to the top 13, and particularly the top five, universities. They confirm that the field from which this country recruits its future elite is \"extraordinarily narrow\". An assessment in yesterday's Sunday Times, largely hostile to Gordon Brown, estimated that private schools, to which 7% of our children go, account for 80% of the judiciary, 80% of the highest ranks in the army, 40% of the diplomatic service and even for a third of Tony Blair's own life peers.</p> <p>This is not simply an issue of smug discrimination, though that is still a substantial part of it. It is also a mark of how badly Wilson's aspirations and the measures he hoped would liberate locked-up talent have fallen short of fulfilment over the past four decades. The end of the 11-plus and the general adoption of comprehensive schools, which he saw as one of the mighty engines of change, has failed to deliver. The reasons for that need to come as close to the heart of Labour's new campaign as the imperfections of Oxbridge. Mr Brown was wrong to raise the issue of equal opportunity in the hasty way that he did: on the facts that have now emerged, he owes an apology to Magdalen and specifically to its senior tutor in medicine, and he ought to offer it now.

Corso pauses at a Latin inscription beneath an engraving. \"Silence is golden.\" Balkan turns to face him. \"Precisely.\" He turns back to the window. \"Ever heard of the De La Demonica?\" \"Yeah,\" Corso shrugs. \"I've heard of it. It's a myth, isn't it? A book reputed to have been written by Satan himself.\" Balkan exhales slowly. \"No myth. That book existed. Torchia actually acquired it.\" He paces the room. \"The engravings you're now admitting were copied by Torchia from the De La Demonica. They form a kind of Satanic riddle. Correctly interpreted, with the aid of the original text and sufficient inside information, they're reputed to conjure up the Prince of Darkness himself.\" Corso glances up from the text. \"You don't say.\" See also: Bedazzled, Rosemary's Baby, Race With The Devil, South Park: Bigger, Longer And Uncut Don't see also: End Of Days, Angel Heart, The Devil's Advocate Pointless trivia: Frank Langella is the long-term partner of Whoopi Goldberg",

Uefa say that, because they decided upon broadcast rights back in 1993 when the internet was simply a twinkle in Martha Lane Fox's eye, there is not enough space in the grounds to dole out passes to internet hacks.

Its official colour is antelope (a bit pretentious but funny) - milk chocolate brown in other words. </p> <p> <strong> What does it say about you? </strong> People say it suits me because I wear a lot of brown. <strong> What do you like about it? </strong> I got it at a good price because of its colour. I assume other buyers turned their noses up, but I think it's an edible colour. The only negative thing is that it has a dog-leg gearstick which took an age to learn. </p> <p> <strong> Why did you buy it? </strong> It's fast and has a great shape, a classic design - the best Porsche made. </p> <p> <strong> What kind of driver are you? </strong> Safe. When I was learning, my dad told me to assume everyone on the road was an idiot. That has stuck with me. </p> <p> <strong> Any bad habits? </strong> I keep a dictaphone between my legs while I write songs in the car. I suppose that's dangerous. </p> <p> <strong> Any driving test tales? </strong> I anticipated the emergency stop too soon, causing the examiner to hit his head on the windscreen. I failed. </p> <p> <strong> What was your first car? </strong> A Citro\u00ebn 2CV. It burst into flames on the M4. </p> <p> <strong> Ever crashed / got a speeding ticket / got any points, etc? </strong> I've had lots of speeding tickets. I forgot the speed limit on an open road in Florida. There was no one around except for the police hiding in the bushes. They pulled us over; when my passenger got out to explain, we suddenly had a gun pointing at us. </p> <p> <strong> Ever experienced road rage? </strong> I was being hassled by a flash Audi and when my passenger flicked the Vs we were chased. He cut across us to stop me, then kicked the passenger window in. </p> <p> <strong> Have you ever had sex in a car? </strong> I did once in the back of a van at a beach party. I didn't realise that the van was gradually going down a slope towards the bonfire. Everyone knew what I was up to! </p> <p> <strong> What music do you listen to on the road? </strong> Nothing. I love the sound of my engine too much. </p> <p> <strong> What's your dream car? </strong> I recently drove a Mercedes Pagoda 230SL with the roof off and was impressed. </p> <p> <strong> Who would be your dream passenger? </strong> Matt Dillon. I've always fancied him. I was staying in the same hotel as him once and bumped into him in the lift. He invited me out for a drink with his friends but I was too dumbfounded to go. </p> <p>Sarah Cracknell sings in Saint Etienne. Their new album Sound of Water is out now.</p>",

      "bodyText": "What do you drive? A 1970 Porsche 911T. Its official colour is antelope (a bit pretentious but funny) - milk chocolate brown in other words. What does it say about you? People say it suits me because I wear a lot of brown. What do you like about it? I got it at a good price because of its colour. I assume other buyers turned their noses up, but I think it's an edible colour. The only negative thing is that it has a dog-leg gearstick which took an age to learn. Why did you buy it? It's fast and has a great shape, a classic design - the best Porsche made. What kind of driver are you? Safe. When I was learning, my dad told me to assume everyone on the road was an idiot. That has stuck with me. Any bad habits? I keep a dictaphone between my legs while I write songs in the car. I suppose that's dangerous. Any driving test tales? I anticipated the emergency stop too soon, causing the examiner to hit his head on the windscreen. I failed. What was your first car? A Citro\u00ebn 2CV. It burst into flames on the M4. Ever crashed / got a speeding ticket / got any points, etc? I've had lots of speeding tickets. I forgot the speed limit on an open road in Florida. There was no one around except for the police hiding in the bushes. They pulled us over; when my passenger got out to explain, we suddenly had a gun pointing at us. Ever experienced road rage? I was being hassled by a flash Audi and when my passenger flicked the Vs we were chased. He cut across us to stop me, then kicked the passenger window in. Have you ever had sex in a car? I did once in the back of a van at a beach party. I didn't realise that the van was gradually going down a slope towards the bonfire. Everyone knew what I was up to! What music do you listen to on the road? Nothing. I love the sound of my engine too much. What's your dream car? I recently drove a Mercedes Pagoda 230SL with the roof off and was impressed. Who would be your dream passenger? Matt Dillon. I've always fancied him. I was staying in the same hotel as him once and bumped into him in the lift. He invited me out for a drink with his friends but I was too dumbfounded to go. Sarah Cracknell sings in Saint Etienne. Their new album Sound of Water is out now.",

      "trailText": "<p>null</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>* Last week's cover story about the new editor of the News of the World prompted a fascinating exchange, beginning with a letter to the Guardian readers' editor. A teacher at a Cheshire school writes to inform us that, for all the time Rebekah Wade attended, it was a comprehensive, not a grammar school as we stated. It's a fair cop, we'll correct it, we said. But Ms Wade's office was not at all helpful. We appeal directly to you, Rebekah, was it a comp or a grammar? There's nothing to be ashamed of, we're all friends here. As the teacher writes: \"You can rest assured that she is, for good or ill (and I wish her well), a product of the comprehensive school system.\" </p> <p>*Reports reach the diary of extraordinary shenanigans over the new series of OK!TV. Producers Carlton and the celebrity mag fell out so badly after the first series that GMTV was finally signed up as substitute at the end of last week. It seems OK!'s sales didn't rise as owner Richard Desmond expected, although he shelled out all the costs for access to stars. Worse still, ONdigital - partly owned by Carlton - failed to jump at the chance to screen his soft-porn Fantasy channel as a quid pro quo. And the final straw, bringing to a head TV frustrations with Desmond's thriftiness, was a big row over a \u00a310 taxi fare to shuttle tapes around. Now GMTV, under its gritty director of programmes, Peter McHugh, has been brought in, because ITV believes that \"Desmond doesn't know how to do TV - yet\". He wants to make OK!TV as an independent production from a studio within his London Docklands offices, handily vacated by Fantasy. Except, says GMTV crisply, \"it's not up to broadcast quality. We're there to make sure it looks like an ITV programme.\" </p> <p>*More trouble for GMTV? The BBC's revamped Breakfast TV programme, which will be shared with News 24, is expected to start in October, after the Sydney Olympics conclude. But rumour has it that BBC1 controller Peter Salmon, bursting with public service duty, wants it to end at 8.30am rather than 9am, so he can switch into more attractive lifestyle programming early and get a head start on ITV. Meanwhile, Anthony Howard's Times column - pompously arguing that adults don't watch TV at daybreak because the Today programme suits the British public's morning habits best - has had them choking over their sticky croissants at the breakfast station. What are those 2m-plus couch potatoes doing at 8am then, Tony? </p> <p>*All change in the world of showbiz hackery: since the Mirror's Matthew Wright announced he was giving up his column, speculation has been rife concerning the identity of his successor. The diary can reveal that it's successors, not successor: Wright's deputy Polly Graham, the Telegraph's entertainment reporter Jessica Callan and the Star's Eva Simpson are being teamed up to form a glamour trio to rival the Sun's rather less aesthetically pleasing Dominic Mohan. </p> <p>*Regulators are getting ever cosier. While the seemingly doomed independent television commission produces new public consultation plans on a weekly basis, the radio authority and broadcasting standards commission are taking a different route.

      "bodyText": "* Last week's cover story about the new editor of the News of the World prompted a fascinating exchange, beginning with a letter to the Guardian readers' editor. A teacher at a Cheshire school writes to inform us that, for all the time Rebekah Wade attended, it was a comprehensive, not a grammar school as we stated. It's a fair cop, we'll correct it, we said. But Ms Wade's office was not at all helpful. We appeal directly to you, Rebekah, was it a comp or a grammar? There's nothing to be ashamed of, we're all friends here. As the teacher writes: \"You can rest assured that she is, for good or ill (and I wish her well), a product of the comprehensive school system.\" *Reports reach the diary of extraordinary shenanigans over the new series of OK!TV. Producers Carlton and the celebrity mag fell out so badly after the first series that GMTV was finally signed up as substitute at the end of last week. It seems OK!'s sales didn't rise as owner Richard Desmond expected, although he shelled out all the costs for access to stars. Worse still, ONdigital - partly owned by Carlton - failed to jump at the chance to screen his soft-porn Fantasy channel as a quid pro quo. And the final straw, bringing to a head TV frustrations with Desmond's thriftiness, was a big row over a \u00a310 taxi fare to shuttle tapes around. Now GMTV, under its gritty director of programmes, Peter McHugh, has been brought in, because ITV believes that \"Desmond doesn't know how to do TV - yet\". He wants to make OK!TV as an independent production from a studio within his London Docklands offices, handily vacated by Fantasy. Except, says GMTV crisply, \"it's not up to broadcast quality. We're there to make sure it looks like an ITV programme.\" *More trouble for GMTV? The BBC's revamped Breakfast TV programme, which will be shared with News 24, is expected to start in October, after the Sydney Olympics conclude. But rumour has it that BBC1 controller Peter Salmon, bursting with public service duty, wants it to end at 8.30am rather than 9am, so he can switch into more attractive lifestyle programming early and get a head start on ITV. Meanwhile, Anthony Howard's Times column - pompously arguing that adults don't watch TV at daybreak because the Today programme suits the British public's morning habits best - has had them choking over their sticky croissants at the breakfast station. What are those 2m-plus couch potatoes doing at 8am then, Tony? *All change in the world of showbiz hackery: since the Mirror's Matthew Wright announced he was giving up his column, speculation has been rife concerning the identity of his successor. The diary can reveal that it's successors, not successor: Wright's deputy Polly Graham, the Telegraph's entertainment reporter Jessica Callan and the Star's Eva Simpson are being teamed up to form a glamour trio to rival the Sun's rather less aesthetically pleasing Dominic Mohan. *Regulators are getting ever cosier. While the seemingly doomed independent television commission produces new public consultation plans on a weekly basis, the radio authority and broadcasting standards commission are taking a different route. At a recent seminar on how to regulate the internet, the two bodies were very much in evidence, lapping up the advice from Australian television authority deputy chairman, Gareth Grainger, that Australia's attempt to import detailed television-style monitoring doesn't work. The two bodies are due to announce a further entente cordiale tomorrow and are also working together on research into acceptable radio standards, ie how far loutish DJs can go. All part of a new \"joined-up regulation approach\" - otherwise known as survival tactics for endangered watchdogs. *Special thanks from the diary to ex-GQ editor Mr James Brown and his IFG magazine empire, which last week sent a latex version of the enfant terrible's head on a stake to the Guardian's offices.

      "body": "<p>Joely Richardson baring her back for Maybe Baby. Chris Evans sleeping with Geri Halliwell. Any Benetton poster you care to mention. Well, almost any rude ad you care to mention. All put together by media manipulators so that a lazy picture desk can fill a dreary newspaper. Oh, the joy of the PR stunt. You can't open your newspaper or switch on your telly without seeing them. It's so this century. Got a product? Get a stunt. That'll give you few column inches in the Daily Star. </p> <p>Indeed, the ubiquity of the PR stunt means that at one point during Ken Livingstone's mayoral campaign no fewer than 14 separate companies or pressure groups had men dressed up as different animals following him around to shine in his reflected glory. And yet, for all this year's media flyboys' fancy talk, they ain't doing nuthin' that ain't been done before. </p> <p>On July 5, Improperganda opens at Proud Galleries, London. The exhibition celebrates the noble art of shameless attention grabbing by the PR industry - the grown-up equivalent of those room-to-let ads that say \"FREE SEX! Now that I've got your attention\" - and it's a blast. </p> <p>There are nurses sticking plasters on whales, a street full of 50 sofas, a pig standing for president, a flying lion, a trapeze artist swinging from a pair of pants, brothels for pets and men selling fridges to Eskimos. The exhibition is curated by PR stuntmeister Mark Borkowski, who got involved because of a man named Jim Moran. \"Jim was a huge influence on this sort of stunt, and he did everything the PR industry is doing today in the US in the 40s and 50s at the advent of television, when the photo-op was becoming an element of the media,\" says Borkowski. </p> <p>\"Most of the time he came up with the idea, then sold it to the client. He died last year and not a single newspaper gave him an obituary, although I did come across a mention on the internet from a Seattle paper. I wanted to work on this as a tribute.\" </p> <p>It was Moran who sat on an ostrich egg for 19 days, four hours and 32 minutes before hatching it to publicise the novel The Egg and I. He searched for a needle in a haystack for 10 days to promote a piece of real estate. He climbed from one horse to another in a Nevada river to urge voters to vote Republican after the Democrats had urged voters not to change horses in mid-stream. </p> <p>And it was Moran who created the greatest soundbite the world has yet known. To publicise some bizarre product, Moran excelled himself in stuntland and tried to send an extremely short man up into the air above Manhattan's Central Park on a vast kite. Inevitably, the New York cops intervened and banned his foolhardy behaviour. An outraged Moran gave a press conference where he said: \"It's a sad day for American cap italism when a man can't fly a midget on a kite over Central Park.\" </p> <p>Moran's contemporaries included Harry Reichenbach, an equally unhinged publicist who once booked himself and his piano into the Ritz in New York. After four days, during which he ordered 50lb of raw steak from room service, a bell boy pointed out to a worried management that the strange guest's curious Chinese name might be significant. They broke into Mr TR Zan's room, found a live lion instead of a piano and, bizarrely, right after the story broke, the movie Tarzan was launched. </p> <p>To sell September Morn, a very poor quality but faintly risqu\u00e9 picture of a woman standing in a lake, Reichenbach hired a gang of teenagers to gaze at it in a shop window then complained to a bishop about the picture's effect on the young. When the bishop turned up, he found idle youths wasting their days in contemplation of filth and started a moral crusade. Within a year, the artist was unable to meet demand, sailors were getting the woman tattooed on their forearms and a smart-arse entrepreneur had started selling tie-in dolls. Reichenbach took the job on a \"no win, no fee\" basis and was handsomely paid. </p> <p>Improperganda tells the jaded media industry that it's all been done before. Joely Richardson flaunting flesh for Maybe Baby? Diana Dors floated down a Venetian canal in a backless number to boost her film career, courtesy of Theo Cowan at the Rank Charm School. \"A lot of those American guys were using tricks that the Situationists and the Dadaists were using in art,\" explains Dan Brooke, head of marketing and development at Film Four. \"They were the people who influenced us when we were working at the Paramount Channel.\" </p> <p>Brooke was the head of marketing at Paramount who invented all the political stunts the comedy channel used to heighten awareness in 1997 and 1998. They followed Peter Mandelson around dressed as Dr Death with posters saying \"welcome, Prince of Darkness\". They built a mini-dome in his front garden. When Liam Gallagher slagged off the Rolling Stones, they hired karate experts in Mick Jagger masks to hang around Liam's house inviting him to fight. Liam bottled it and called the police. </p> <p>Brooke's finest hour was the Tory leadership election. As Michael Portillo was unable to stand, he hired a load of actors dressed as Mexicans with posters saying \"Portillo for El Presidente\" and, complete with band and donkeys, laid siege to College Green outside the houses of parliament. A crazy Mexican appeared in every TV interview. For the second round of voting, ITN built a six-foot stage on the green to keep the clowns out of the picture, but Brooke went to the circus to recruit stilt walkers and kept the Mexicans in shot. </p> <p>\"It's very popular now,\" he says, \"and it's getting harder and harder to be heard. We'd pay about \u00a3150 for our stunts then, but the price has soared now.\" </p> <p>These days a stunt like that can set you back anything upwards of \u00a315,000. When Freud Communications was hired by Pepsico in 1997 to publicise the fact that Pepsi cans were to become blue, it spent \u00a32m to hire Concorde and paint it blue, taking the stunt to levels that would have had Moran gasping in awe. </p> <p>\"The stunt only works these days if there's a real story or a real strategy backing it up,\" says Patrick Keegan, a director of Freud Communications, which celebrates its 15th birthday this year. Its first client was Jiffi condoms, whose Freud-inspired slogan You'll Never Put A Better Bit Of Rubber In Your Wife was banned by Westminster council when it was used in a shop window. \"A good stunt can put you on the news agenda if it's a slow news day and you seize the right opportunity,\" Keegan continues. \"There's going to be loads of people trying to do Euro 2000 stunts, and someone always does something with strawberries and cream around Wimbledon, but that never gets any coverage. If you get that attention and you get it right, you have to have something to back it up with or people get wise pretty quickly.\" </p> <p>Of course, people getting wise has happened before. Moran took a car around America looking for a wife and got the front page of Time magazine - although a newspaper reporter in the midwest wrote a feature about the stunt including the names of every single car manufacturer in the western world with the exception of the machine Moran was trying to shift. The authorities are wising up, too. The standard fine levied by Westminster council for a projection on a public structure such as a building or a bridge is now \u00a320,000. </p> <p>\"That's a lot of expense to go for if all you're going to get is a picture in the Daily Star, so you need to be sure the media are interested before you embark on the stunt,\" says one PR man who wished not to be identified - probably because he went on to say, \"after all, the Star will run anything. Where's the value in that?\" </p> <p>The depressing thing about the exhibition is the impression you inevitably take away that nothing in the news is real. In real life, of course, it's much worse than that. Did the woman teacher on the Challenger die for a publicity stunt, for instance? And if we're talking about Nasa, there's no need for a countdown when you're launching a space rocket. You know what time the beast is going up. The countdown was a Nasa PR man's idea to heighten tension for the TV broadcast. Ever felt cheated? </p> <p>Improperganda is at Proud Galleries, 5 Buckingham St, London WC2 in July, (tel 020 7839 4942)</p>",

      "body": "<p>Only in Hollywood, where the entertainment business has absolutely no sense of shame, could this be possible. The TV remake of the blockbuster movie remake of the long-running 60s TV drama, The Fugitive, is once again the hottest property in town. The talk, whisper it, is that it could be the next Friends or ER. </p> <p>Dr Richard Kimble has got that magical ingredient, the much sought after \"buzz\", courtesy of a time honoured industry ritual - the LA Screenings. This entertainment bun fight, where overseas broadcasters fight to the death for the hottest US import to take back home, is crucial to the making or breaking of a new series. This year, The Fugitive is undoubtedly the must-have show. A dead cert for a translation to British TV screens. It's just a question of which channel will triumph. </p> <p>Every year, for a fortnight in late May and early June, hundreds of foreign programme buyers flock to Los Angeles to sample the latest televisual offerings from the major studios and a dwindling band of independent producers. The gathering takes place after the US networks have placed orders with producers for new shows for their autumn schedules. </p> <p>For buyers from the BBC, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky, the job is a terrible bind, of course. Two weeks in a $250-plus-per-night Beverly Hills hotel, while being wooed by the world's most powerful media and entertainment companies? Awful. This year, buyers were treated to at least three lavish parties, thrown by Warner Bros, Universal and Paramount, with special screenings of new movies Dinosaurs and Mission Impossible 2. The British contingent also found time to play their regular football fixture against a US studios team. They lost 3-1. Try not to laugh. </p> <p>The vibrant social side of the event has its professional uses, or so they claim, allowing buyers to pick up the buzz about hot shows, check out what the competition is up to and generally dip a toe into the LA entertainment scene. </p> <p>In between the fun bits, the serious business of assessing the latest crop of shows goes on in darkened screening rooms on studio lots in Burbank and hotels around Beverly Hills. It is a gruelling schedule: this year British programme buyers will have watched full pilots or promotional clips of around 60 new projects set for an autumn or mid-season debut by one of the six US networks (NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, WB and UPN) over a 10-day period. The stakes are high - nod off and you could miss the next X Files. </p> <p>Jane Lighting, chief operating officer and head of TV and content at Flextech, was on her first visit to the LA Screenings this year and admits it is a long way to go to watch a bunch of shows she could look at on VHS cassettes back in London. \"But it is incredibly useful to be able to see all the US productions coming up over 10 days,\" Lighting adds. \"You can make comparisons, spot trends and generally find out who's hot and who's not.\" </p> <p>In addition to the Fugitive remake, new drama on offer at the screenings included Ally McBeal executive producer David E Kelley's Boston Public, set in a suburban high school, and The Street, which revolves around a group of hotshot Wall Street traders, from Sex and the City creator Darren Star. Trendspotters will have noticed plenty of star sitcom vehicles (featuring the likes of John Goodman, Geena Davis, Bette Midler and Michael \"Kramer\" Richards) and a continuation of the 1990s paranormal theme, including an X Files spin-off, Lone Gunmen. </p> <p>Obviously, spotting the potential hits is essential, but trying to avoid snapping up a show that gets cancelled by its US broadcaster after only a handful of episodes is equally important. As BBC controller of programme acquisition, Sophie Turner Laing, points out, there are a number of \"death slots\" in the US schedules, most notably against the US version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, which will be running four nights a week on ABC this autumn. </p> <p>Some years a show emerges as a must-have for two or more channels and a bidding war ensues. In 1994, for instance, the BBC scored a notable victory by landing the X Files, but two years ago it lost out to Channel 4 in a bidding war for Sex and the City. \"You prefer to wait until the autumn, to see how a show performs in the US,\" Turner Laing says. \"But it's a competitive market and if the trigger gets pulled, you go for it.\" </p> <p>There's another significant downside to leaping too soon. If an American acquisition fails to do the audience numbers in prime time, it can end up languishing in a late night slot where it will never find the viewers to justify the price tag. ITV suffered this unenviable fate with Millennium, from X Files creator Chris Carter, after outbidding the BBC for terrestrial rights in 1996. The show had everything: pedigree, buzz, style - but no viewers. ITV came a cropper again the following year with the Kirstie Alley sitcom Veronica's Closet, having beaten rival bids from Channel 4 and Channel 5. </p> <p>In the past couple of years, British broadcasters have avoided getting into bidding wars, in part as a reaction against the costly failures of the mid-90s. This year, The Fugitive is the nearest thing to a must-have show. Most buyers praise the pilot's impressive production values and expect it to find a home on British TV, but are standing by to see what Channel 4 - which has a first look output deal with the show's distributor, Warner Bros - will do. But Channel 4 controller of acquisitions, June Dromgoole, insists the show is available to all comers, prompting speculation that Warner Bros may be holding out for a big money bid from another British broadcaster. </p> <p>One development expected to provoke fierce competition between British buyers is the launch later this year of new Channel 4 entertainment service E4, which will be looking to pick up digital, cable and satellite rights to shows that Sky One and Flextech are also likely to be after. Dromgoole says E4 will be \"competing in some areas\" with Sky One, notably teenage, entertainment and drama programming. Another British acquisitions executive reckons the arrival of E4 will \"make things quite awkward for Sky One\", which has built a brand around showcasing the best US shows. </p> <p>E4 has already nabbed rights to the second series of critically acclaimed US drama The West Wing, which premiered this year on Sky One, thanks to Channel 4's output deal with Warner Bros. That relationship should also enable Channel 4 to have its pick of the studio's 2000 offerings. </p> <p>But Sky One has its own Hollywood ally in the form of 20th Cen tury Fox, a sibling News Corp subsidiary. Fox shows that Sky can expect first dibs on include Boston Public, James Cameron's Dark Angel and Lone Gunmen. </p> <p>These days, however, even the most popular US shows rarely succeed in prime time on British terrestrial channels against home-grown opposition. It's a long time since Dallas and Dynasty ruled the ratings. Most British acquisitions executives come to the LA Screenings looking for one or two shows that can do a job hitting a certain demographic in a particular slot, usually in the early or late evening schedule. </p> <p>Jeff Ford, controller of acquisitions at Channel 5, went to LA this year looking for shows that could attract the same male-skewed audience as the likes of Xena: Warrior Princess and Martial Law (cancelled, much to his chagrin, by CBS after two series). Ford picked up paranormal 13-parter The Others (a mid-season 2000 replacement already dropped by NBC) and has bids in on two other series, but was otherwise underwhelmed by what was on offer. </p> <p>The Channel 5 executive has a low-budget, maximum impact secret weapon up his sleeve, however: the rerun rights to the original 120-odd episode version of The Fugitive, starring David Janssen as the wronged doctor Kimble. No fear of that being axed mid-season.</p>",

The TV remake of the blockbuster movie remake of the long-running 60s TV drama, The Fugitive, is once again the hottest property in town. The talk, whisper it, is that it could be the next Friends or ER. Dr Richard Kimble has got that magical ingredient, the much sought after \"buzz\", courtesy of a time honoured industry ritual - the LA Screenings. This entertainment bun fight, where overseas broadcasters fight to the death for the hottest US import to take back home, is crucial to the making or breaking of a new series. This year, The Fugitive is undoubtedly the must-have show. A dead cert for a translation to British TV screens. It's just a question of which channel will triumph. Every year, for a fortnight in late May and early June, hundreds of foreign programme buyers flock to Los Angeles to sample the latest televisual offerings from the major studios and a dwindling band of independent producers. The gathering takes place after the US networks have placed orders with producers for new shows for their autumn schedules. For buyers from the BBC, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky, the job is a terrible bind, of course. Two weeks in a $250-plus-per-night Beverly Hills hotel, while being wooed by the world's most powerful media and entertainment companies? Awful. This year, buyers were treated to at least three lavish parties, thrown by Warner Bros, Universal and Paramount, with special screenings of new movies Dinosaurs and Mission Impossible 2. The British contingent also found time to play their regular football fixture against a US studios team. They lost 3-1. Try not to laugh. The vibrant social side of the event has its professional uses, or so they claim, allowing buyers to pick up the buzz about hot shows, check out what the competition is up to and generally dip a toe into the LA entertainment scene. In between the fun bits, the serious business of assessing the latest crop of shows goes on in darkened screening rooms on studio lots in Burbank and hotels around Beverly Hills. It is a gruelling schedule: this year British programme buyers will have watched full pilots or promotional clips of around 60 new projects set for an autumn or mid-season debut by one of the six US networks (NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, WB and UPN) over a 10-day period. The stakes are high - nod off and you could miss the next X Files. Jane Lighting, chief operating officer and head of TV and content at Flextech, was on her first visit to the LA Screenings this year and admits it is a long way to go to watch a bunch of shows she could look at on VHS cassettes back in London. \"But it is incredibly useful to be able to see all the US productions coming up over 10 days,\" Lighting adds. \"You can make comparisons, spot trends and generally find out who's hot and who's not.\" In addition to the Fugitive remake, new drama on offer at the screenings included Ally McBeal executive producer David E Kelley's Boston Public, set in a suburban high school, and The Street, which revolves around a group of hotshot Wall Street traders, from Sex and the City creator Darren Star. Trendspotters will have noticed plenty of star sitcom vehicles (featuring the likes of John Goodman, Geena Davis, Bette Midler and Michael \"Kramer\" Richards) and a continuation of the 1990s paranormal theme, including an X Files spin-off, Lone Gunmen. Obviously, spotting the potential hits is essential, but trying to avoid snapping up a show that gets cancelled by its US broadcaster after only a handful of episodes is equally important. As BBC controller of programme acquisition, Sophie Turner Laing, points out, there are a number of \"death slots\" in the US schedules, most notably against the US version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, which will be running four nights a week on ABC this autumn. Some years a show emerges as a must-have for two or more channels and a bidding war ensues. In 1994, for instance, the BBC scored a notable victory by landing the X Files, but two years ago it lost out to Channel 4 in a bidding war for Sex and the City. \"You prefer to wait until the autumn, to see how a show performs in the US,\" Turner Laing says. \"But it's a competitive market and if the trigger gets pulled, you go for it.\" There's another significant downside to leaping too soon. If an American acquisition fails to do the audience numbers in prime time, it can end up languishing in a late night slot where it will never find the viewers to justify the price tag. ITV suffered this unenviable fate with Millennium, from X Files creator Chris Carter, after outbidding the BBC for terrestrial rights in 1996. The show had everything: pedigree, buzz, style - but no viewers. ITV came a cropper again the following year with the Kirstie Alley sitcom Veronica's Closet, having beaten rival bids from Channel 4 and Channel 5. In the past couple of years, British broadcasters have avoided getting into bidding wars, in part as a reaction against the costly failures of the mid-90s. This year, The Fugitive is the nearest thing to a must-have show. Most buyers praise the pilot's impressive production values and expect it to find a home on British TV, but are standing by to see what Channel 4 - which has a first look output deal with the show's distributor, Warner Bros - will do. But Channel 4 controller of acquisitions, June Dromgoole, insists the show is available to all comers, prompting speculation that Warner Bros may be holding out for a big money bid from another British broadcaster. One development expected to provoke fierce competition between British buyers is the launch later this year of new Channel 4 entertainment service E4, which will be looking to pick up digital, cable and satellite rights to shows that Sky One and Flextech are also likely to be after. Dromgoole says E4 will be \"competing in some areas\" with Sky One, notably teenage, entertainment and drama programming. Another British acquisitions executive reckons the arrival of E4 will \"make things quite awkward for Sky One\", which has built a brand around showcasing the best US shows. E4 has already nabbed rights to the second series of critically acclaimed US drama The West Wing, which premiered this year on Sky One, thanks to Channel 4's output deal with Warner Bros. That relationship should also enable Channel 4 to have its pick of the studio's 2000 offerings. But Sky One has its own Hollywood ally in the form of 20th Cen tury Fox, a sibling News Corp subsidiary. Fox shows that Sky can expect first dibs on include Boston Public, James Cameron's Dark Angel and Lone Gunmen. These days, however, even the most popular US shows rarely succeed in prime time on British terrestrial channels against home-grown opposition. It's a long time since Dallas and Dynasty ruled the ratings. Most British acquisitions executives come to the LA Screenings looking for one or two shows that can do a job hitting a certain demographic in a particular slot, usually in the early or late evening schedule. Jeff Ford, controller of acquisitions at Channel 5, went to LA this year looking for shows that could attract the same male-skewed audience as the likes of Xena: Warrior Princess and Martial Law (cancelled, much to his chagrin, by CBS after two series). Ford picked up paranormal 13-parter The Others (a mid-season 2000 replacement already dropped by NBC) and has bids in on two other series, but was otherwise underwhelmed by what was on offer. The Channel 5 executive has a low-budget, maximum impact secret weapon up his sleeve, however: the rerun rights to the original 120-odd episode version of The Fugitive, starring David Janssen as the wronged doctor Kimble. No fear of that being axed mid-season.",

For an agency to work with a leftwing party was seen by other clients as supping with the devil or, at the least, a corporate character flaw, while the suspicion of the left toward advertising was virtually boundless. </p> <p>Well, over the past couple of months both Labour and the Conservatives have appointed new agencies after going through a shortlisting and pitching process just like any commercial client and no one has been shocked. </p> <p>It was Margaret Thatcher who, I think unwittingly, changed attitudes. The appointment of Saatchi and the dramatic impact of the \"Labour isn't working\" campaign woke everyone up to the impact good advertising could have in electoral battles. (I say unwittingly because the agency was actually Saatchi and Saatchi Garland Compton. The brief had been to find an agency with plenty of good solid government advertising experience, which Garland Compton had. Mrs Thatcher must have been as surprised as everyone else with the outcome, especially as she is said to have argued that the poster would be seen as an advertisement for Labour as it had Labour and not Conservative in the headline). Indirectly, it was Mrs T who also changed attitudes on the left. Her proposal to abolish the Greater London Council led to the hiring of BMP and the imaginative posters that made the other side look silly and leaden footed. The campaign created a great majority against abolition and the realisation by the left that advertising could work for them too. </p> <p>It can be difficult to remember just how far attitudes on the left have come. In the early 70s, stridency was the most used approach, epitomised by the \"Out, out, out\" and \"Kill the bill\" kind of demonstrators. It was not usually thought necessary to make messages interesting or relevant to their audience, nor was there any idea that the audience might be other than true believers who had merely dozed off. If they were given vast amounts of detailed information and shouted at loudly enough, the job would be done. </p> <p>A health union, I remember, ran an advertisement (only in leftwing journals, of course) with the enticing headline \"The filthiest sheets in Britain\". Somehow you didn't feel the urge to read on. Denis Lyons, a leading PR adviser and left sympathiser called in to advise one union, discovered a letter from its general secretary to the editor of a national paper protesting at a story they had run that began, \"While we expect no favours from the running dogs of capitalism . . .\" </p> <p>Advertising media schedulers were forced to exclude any papers with Tory views - thus severely restricting the possibility for conversion - as this was construed to be a donation to the proprietors. Party political broadcasts were largely talking heads of politicians, whose main interest and argument was over whose turn it was to appear and get the extra exposure. If they were feeling especially inventive, the format of the broadcast would mimic a current affairs TV programme (more recently, even John Smith had to be persuaded that Newsnight was not the most viewed programme on TV). Research was often seen as dangerous stuff. Michael Foot, famously, wouldn't allow it during the 1983 general election, relying instead on his ecstatic reception at political rallies as a guide. </p> <p>Nowadays both parties use agencies very much as commercial clients use agencies, but the advertising is pretty different from commercial advertising because it is so adversarial. Brands don't slag each other off in the way that parties do, so why do politicians do it? </p> <p>Of course they always have - the tone has actually moderated. The charges 18th- and 19th-century politicians threw at each other (and that US candidates still do) would be libellous by today's standards. </p> <p>National elections are a two-horse race, so attacking the other side is a feasible strategy, which it wouldn't be in most brand markets. It's easier for people to think ill of politicians than for them to respond to promises, but mostly it is the shock-horror-drama of attack that makes it valuable to parties. For the same reason that an aircraft crashing at Heathrow is news and a thousand safe take-offs is not, the evil plans of the other side make good copy and your plans for more cr\u00e8ches do not. It is easier to work the troops into a lather for a fight with tales of the evils perpetrated by the enemy than it is by reminding them of the virtue of your cause, and much of the role of advertising in elections is to rally the troops and set the agenda for the fight. </p> <p>However, there is attack that is really just empty slagging and attack that has content and bite. Labour's skill in the last election left little room for the Conservatives to frighten the electorate, so they talked of \"new danger\" and an evil red-eyed Tony Blair which had no effect other than creating a very large hole in their bank balance. In 1992 the Tory tax bombshell ad had effectively frightened some voters out of voting Labour by dramatically presenting (and exaggerating of course) Labour's plans to up taxes. In 1997 Labour effectively pinned voters' economic dissatisfaction onto the Conservatives' \"22 tax rises\" and won a huge majority mainly by keeping large numbers of fed-up Tory voters at home. </p> <p>Focus groups always complain about knocking copy, occasionally regulators dream of stepping in, many politicians find it distasteful, but still it goes on, for the very simple reason that it works more effectively than the blandness inherent in the positive. Contrary to popular belief, the greater part of political speeches are given over to the positive, but you wouldn't think so because media coverage focuses on the dramatic and - bar amazing new promises - that is the attack on the other side. </p> <p>Luckily for us all there are limits and these are imposed by what the British voter will stand. Gratuitous rudeness just doesn't work (remember how media attacks on Red Ken backfired when his appearances on TV showed him to be the south London boy from next door) and is demeaning to the perpetrators (at the last election, the New Labour New Danger campaign elicited the response \"well, if that is the best they can say for themselves after 18 years in government . . .\"). Attack needs relevance and content if it is to impress. </p> <p>In putting together my talk for the International Adevertising Association (IAA) congress on this subject I wanted to pull together interesting examples of political advertising from around the world. It might just be me, but I could find nothing very interesting from the last few years. Could the genre be in decline? </p> <p>The transformation of political attitudes to advertising has led to the internalisation of many of the tricks of the advertising trade by the politicians: regular focus group feedback, distillation of message, continuity of delivery and endless repetition to get it through. </p> <p>What is the role of the agency now? From the \"war room\" at Little Rock, the Clinton campaign leadership would ring through their requirements to a copywriter who, armed with a pair of scissors, would cut up some newsreel, lay down a voice track and have that day's rebuttal or attack on air in hours. All the Democrats' work that I've been able to find in recent history, and on both sides in the current primaries, is deathly dull - no room has been left for agency input on strategy or ideas. In the UK there is still, happily, a penchant for bright ideas by the parties, but the relentless pressure of the short term threatens the grip on overall direction. Events crop up almost daily that seem to have the potential to derail; advisers, to be visible, must find threats each week and you finish up with a myriad of things to deal with. </p> <p>Yet political change is tectonic. For instance, despite all the smoke and noise of political campaigning between the last two elections only two events made a measurable impact on public opinion - the ERM failure and Tony Blair's accession to the leadership. Reassuringly, despite all the talk of spin, it is still real and major political events that shape opinion and too much concentration on the minutiae of battle can be at the expense of the big picture. Big advertising ideas that really work come out of big strategic ideas and it's there that the politicians might need good agencies as much as on the ads for the daily battle. </p> <p>Chris Powell is chairman of BMP DDB Ltd and is speaking on selling politics at the IAA conference on Wednesday. His book How the Left Learned to Love Advertising is available from BMP DDB,12 Bishops Bridge Road, London W2 6AA</p> <p><strong>The rattling of a stick inside a swill bucket?: Belinda Archer on the ethics of advertising</strong></p> <p>Is advertising ethical? Can it really be a force for good, or is it just the ill-disguised work of the devil? Should golden-haired, innocent little children be directly targeted with grubby commercial messages, for instance, and is there not something inherently immoral about a business that flogs people things they can't afford? This week, more than 1,400 adfolk from around the globe are converging on London to discuss such pithy issues at the 37th International Advertising Association world congress. </p> <p>Throughout the week, leading non-industry names including Bodyshop founder Anita Roddick, Professor Germaine Greer and Nato's Dr Jamie Shea will be tackling various specific ethical topics such as the depiction of women in advertising, whether self-regulation is preferable to statutory controls and the social and human responsibilities of communications businesses. </p> <p>But on Friday afternoon, delegates will gather for the Great Ethics Debate, hosted by John Hooper, chairman of the European Advertising Tripartite. </p> <p>A panel of top European and US industry figures and critics will be led through the minefield of such all-encompassing issues as advertising's role in society, advertising to children and ethics in advertising. </p> <p>To many, the two words \"ethical\" and \"advertising\" are mutually exclusive. But must they always trigger a snort of derision? In short, was George Orwell right when he said advertising is just \"the rattling of a stick inside a swill bucket\"? </p> <p>Hooper is positive: \"Being ethical means that you have professional standards of conduct and I believe that the advertising industry can hold its head up, proud that it has very high standards. Advertising people, for the most part, are solid citizens with high personal morality. They are not rogues and villains. Obviously, there are some who are, but the majority will always marginalise those and are very quick to jump on them.\" </p> <p>Critics, of course, point to the fact that advertising can stimulate unnecessary consumption and acquisition - an immoral, if not positively dangerous, activity in poorer countries. </p> <p>Some go so far as to say it directly causes environmental damage via its fancy commercials for cars, lashing out further at the general moral and economic harm of promoting lifestyles beyond most people's means. </p> <p>Archbishop John Foley, president of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications at the Vatican, is one of the speakers at the conference likely to be taking such a stance. </p> <p>Foley tells Media Guardian: \"Advertising has to be responsible firstly to the truth and secondly to the human person. It shouldn't exploit the elderly, it shouldn't make people want things they don't want: it should be honest and helpful and those who engage in it should be more responsible.\" </p> <p>The issue of advertising's role leads to another thorny topic which will be thrashed out this week by concerned international adfolk: what of advertising to children? This is a particularly tricky area in which all the perceived evils of the profession are crystallised. How can something which fills the heads of wide-eyed, innocent children with exploitative, \"buy me\" messages be condoned? </p> <p>Elizabeth Lascoutx, director of the children's advisory review unit in America, a near-militant volun tary organisation which effectively polices kids' advertising and publicises any transgressors of its code, believes it is not a necessarily negative or immoral activity. </p> <p>\"If done properly and in conjunction with media-literacy training in schools, whereby children are shown how to think critically about it, advertising can be constructive in shaping them into informed consumers - something which is crucial in a consumer society,\" she says. </p> <p>Others argue that it is impossible to \"protect\" children from advertising given that adult forms of it are present everywhere and therefore it is best to specifically tailor commercial messages towards kids so they can understand them better. Many of the recent toy crazes among children have also come about without the aid of advertising: Teletubbies, Furbies and even yo-yos all became soaraway successes among youthful consumers without being advertised at all. Most sweets aren't advertised either, they say. </p> <p>\"Children have been pestering their parents for years,\" says Brown, \"but advertising is only one of the dimensions that kids are involved in. There's also peer group pressure in the playground, what they see in shops and on TV programmes. It is too easy to oversimplify the case and say that advertising encourages pester power.\" </p> <p>As the adfolk pull off from the IAA congress in their Porsches and sink back into their first-class cabin seats, they might just find themselves considering the wider moral and ethical implications of their money-spinning activities. Unless Hooper is wrong and they are all rogues and villains.</p>",

To many, the two words \"ethical\" and \"advertising\" are mutually exclusive. But must they always trigger a snort of derision?

How can something which fills the heads of wide-eyed, innocent children with exploitative, \"buy me\" messages be condoned? Elizabeth Lascoutx, director of the children's advisory review unit in America, a near-militant volun tary organisation which effectively polices kids' advertising and publicises any transgressors of its code, believes it is not a necessarily negative or immoral activity. \"If done properly and in conjunction with media-literacy training in schools, whereby children are shown how to think critically about it, advertising can be constructive in shaping them into informed consumers - something which is crucial in a consumer society,\" she says. Others argue that it is impossible to \"protect\" children from advertising given that adult forms of it are present everywhere and therefore it is best to specifically tailor commercial messages towards kids so they can understand them better. Many of the recent toy crazes among children have also come about without the aid of advertising: Teletubbies, Furbies and even yo-yos all became soaraway successes among youthful consumers without being advertised at all. Most sweets aren't advertised either, they say. \"Children have been pestering their parents for years,\" says Brown, \"but advertising is only one of the dimensions that kids are involved in. There's also peer group pressure in the playground, what they see in shops and on TV programmes. It is too easy to oversimplify the case and say that advertising encourages pester power.\" As the adfolk pull off from the IAA congress in their Porsches and sink back into their first-class cabin seats, they might just find themselves considering the wider moral and ethical implications of their money-spinning activities. Unless Hooper is wrong and they are all rogues and villains.",

Rachel Austin, who describes herself as an \"access coordinator\" for the Glastonbury festival, thinks her degree from Nottingham university was probably as good a route as any - certainly, it convinced her not to be a scientist. \"I had to do a year's work in pharmaceutical research, which made me realise I wanted to work with people rather than in a room full of test tubes.\" </p> <p>And people she got: Glastonbury is licensed for up to 100,000 visitors. At the end of this month, the fields of a remote farm in Somerset will be packed with revellers who have come to see the 300 official musicians, as well as the several hundred other entertainers who descend on Glastonbury for the festival every year. </p> <p>Austin lives in the same village as the founder of the festival, farmer Michael Eavis. \"My mum spoke to Michael - we know him from the village - and she told him that there was no work around here for me. A week later he called and offered me a job. He's eager to employ local people and it's like a family business that has become enormous.\" </p> <p>The festival is coordinated from two small local offices where, as Austin explains, \"we are only just getting round to technology.\" As the festival approaches, workers move onto the site and are housed in Portakabins. Austin's main duties involve dealing with applications from market traders, organising hospitality and dealing with general inquiries. Passes have to be issued for both performers and traders, and during festival days Austin has a constant queue of people outside her office. \"There are people outside, the phones are going manic and you've got people trying to blag passes. Everybody tries it on - there are always a few who get away with it. But those who really want to come pay for it,\" she says. </p> <p>To do her job, she says, she needs a computer, a phone, a book and a pen - \"and a can of Coke at my side to keep me awake. One week last year I worked 100 hours.\" She has no doubts that it is worth it, however. \"None of us work for a professional wage but, at the end of day, a lot of causes benefit - our main beneficiaries are Greenpeace, Oxfam and Water Aid, and then there are lots of local charities who provide some hardworking volunteers.\" </p> <p>There have been 20 festivals since the first event was held in 1970. Tickets then sold for \u00a31 and included free milk from the farm. Today the price has risen to \u00a387 and excludes the milk. Those who can't afford the price of a ticket can obtain a pass in exchange for mucking in with jobs such as litter picking. </p> <p>About 1,000 complimentary passes are issued by Eavis to residents of the neighbouring villages of Pilton, Pylle and East Pennard, but not all locals welcome the week-long invasion of visitors into an otherwise sedate neighbourhood. \"We have a few who are anti the festival and they shout quite loudly, but most of them absolutely love it. OK, so they are put out a bit, but it's only for a short time,\" says Austin. </p> <p>Her job is full time and continues throughout the year: \"Just because everyone goes home at the end of the festival doesn't mean that the work is over. There's lost property to sort out, the site needs to be cleaned and everyone has to be paid.\" Her future remains uncertain - as does the festival's - from one year to another. \"Every year you don't know if there is going to be a festival, as every so often they'll decide to take a year off for the sake of the land - you have to remember that Glastonbury is a working farm,\" she says. </p> <p>So how many famous people has she met over the years? \"I make a point of keeping away from the famous - I tend to be on the more public side of things. I really do believe that at Glastonbury the action is in front of the stage. I'd always camp with my friends rather than backstage.\" And how long does she spend worrying about the weather? \"We don't worry about the weather,\" she asserts determinedly, \"because it's going to be sunny!\" </p> <p>Glastonbury Festival runs from 23-25 June. Tickets priced \u00a387 can be booked in advance on 01159 129 129.</p>",

One of them spotted a page of my contacts book and was just as fascinated to see the numbers of Page Three girls. I can't remember now if we traded Michael Heseltine's weekend number for Sam Fox's private line. But when the story spread of my being on first-name terms with the girls - I think it took about 10 minutes - a lot of male colleagues found reasons to inquire after their health. </p> <p>It seemed odd to me that non-Sun readers should be in the least bit curious about the models who parade their charms daily in the Sun and Daily Star. I imagined the whole Page Three thing to be a strictly working-class male obsession, a niche market that would gradually wither away. The editor who pioneered the concept felt the same way. Somewhat embarrassed at having started it all, Larry Lamb later thought it inappropriate. When he died a couple of weeks ago, inevitably and sadly it dominated the headlines of his obituaries. </p> <p>As the years passed and raunchier alternatives became available, in the Sunday Sport and in magazines such as Loaded and FHM, I was sure it was only a matter of time before everyone realised Page Three was a waste of space. It proved to be wishful thinking. Successive editors of the Sun have toyed with dropping it, only to face a barrage of complaints. David Yelland, the latest incumbent, tinkered with the presentation instead. He dropped the silly, if sometimes amusing, captions and his photographers came up with a different way of projecting the models. </p> <p>Like his predecessor, Stuart Higgins, he has also had to withstand the reasoned hostility of several of the Sun's female executives. They have argued less from a feminist perspective than a belief that publishing daily pictures of young women with bared breasts and wide smiles is an anachronism in the 21st century. Frankly, they have argued, there is no point. </p> <p>But that, I'm afraid, is totally untrue. The Sun is hoist on its own petard. It cannot afford to get rid of Page Three. The Sun's existence, its very raison d' tre , depends on maximising sales, on satisfying its readers' appetites. The irony is, of course, that it stimulated those appetites in the first place. </p> <p>In truth, Page Three has become an institution. It exists, in a sense, independently of the Sun. For many people, readers and non-readers, it is the Sun. The newspaper's editor, its journalists, even its owner, Rupert Murdoch, are powerless to do anything about it, however much they despise the need to go on providing it, and despite Murdoch's own prediction years ago that its time was almost up. </p> <p>So ingrained has Page Three become in the national psyche that even the Sun's rivals feel confident enough to refer to it. Just last week two papers that have long scorned the Sun's nude pictures - the Mirror and the Daily Mail - ran big features about Page Three. The Mirror kicked off, interviewing Linda Lusardi, who, according to the writer, \"became a household name more than 20 years ago\" as a Page Three girl. </p> <p>In other words, the Sun's greatest competitor was underlining the success of Page Three, endorsing its place in the nation's affection despite the fact that its own readers, by choosing the Mirror rather than the Sun, have turned their backs on it. There could not be more telling proof of Page Three's status. It was interesting to note too that Lusardi, whom I recall as a truly delightful person, will not be encouraging her daughter to take her clothes off for the cameras. \"I have become a prude in my old age,\" she told the writer. </p> <p>The next day the Daily Mail, noting how Lusardi's appearance and attitudes have changed, took up the theme by interviewing four other former Page Three models. I have this wonderful image of Mail editor Paul Dacre telling his executives at morning conference: \"Cor, that Linda Lusardi looked great, didn't she? We ought to find out what happened to some of the others.\" </p> <p>Who came up with the idea is irrelevant. Its significance lies in the fact that the Mail devoted two pages to women whose fame rests entirely on their having modelled for another paper. </p> <p>None of this surprises Beverley Goodway, who has been the main Page Three photographer throughout its 30-year life span. \"It's even more popular now than it used to be,\" he says. \"It is the Sun's signature. You expect it to be there when you buy the paper.\" </p> <p>Yvonne Paul, a Page Three model agent since 1970, agrees. \"I booked 'em then and I'm still booking 'em today. New girls are contacting me all the time.\" She is disappointed about the loss of captions but likes the new style of pictures. Goodway says: \"I think we've moved the style forward a bit with more fashiony pictures. And the website gets an amazing response.\" Indeed it does. Page 3.com is the UK's fourth most visited website, beaten only by the portals, with about a million hits a day. \"The home of the great British babe\" features picture sets of all the latest models along with golden girls down the years. The latest lure is Tara's \"tiny pink panties\" session. </p> <p>Though some of the pictures might be considered a little too risqu\u00e9 to get into the paper, they are nothing like as sordid as the pornography widely available on the net. The site is full of inventive, if childish, material, such as the \"Mag-nificent 7\" which involves the use of a \"magic microscope\" so that visitors can \"analyse every last little inch\" of the models \"because the beauty's in the detail\". And the caption-writers deposed from the paper have the licence to indulge in some of their purple prose: \"It is a source of pride that only the highest calibre ladies are admitted to the pantheon of beauty that is Page3.com. But when the wobbly lady warbles - we all have our favourites, do we not? </p> <p>\"Some feel a frisson of excitement at the mere mention of that siren of the south, Leilani. Others mop a bead of perspiration at the faintest whisper of Katie - the true angel of the north - while still others . . .\" And so on. The rival Daily Star's website (megastar.co.uk, since you asked) is also very popular, boasting a \"definitive babe barometer\". The prize in a recent contest offered \"a day out with Jade\". All modern Page Three girls have a single name: I guess it makes them easier to remember. </p> <p>So Page Three looks to have a long future in both the Sun and Star. But, ironically, that also threatens the future of the papers too. Despite the undoubted success of the topless pictures, they do restrict the papers' attempts to reposition themselves to win new, young readers. At the Star, that may not matter so much. It knows it has a niche audience and can afford to play up, or down, to it. For the Sun, it is altogether more difficult. Its sales are on the slide and it knows that it has to improve its content if it is to rebuild its circulation. Despite its website popularity, Page Three is really a symbol of its daring past.

How my attitude has changed,\" admitted Andrew Perrins in the aftermath of England's shambolic performance against Malta.</p> <p>But he wasn't the only one to undergo a change of heart. Over the weekend we received another huge batch of emails from Guardian Unlimited readers outlining your ideal England team. In short, Barmby, 3-5-2 and Steven Gerrard are smoking hot, while the Neville brothers, Paul Ince and Alan Shearer are certainly not. </p> <p>Is Nick Barmby really England's latest saviour/left-winger/left wing-back/play-maker? (*delete as appropriate). According to most of our recent emails the answer is a definite yes. Andy Dawson summed up your mood, writing: \"I would play Barmby on the left-wing, especially after the way he played against Malta.

      "bodyText": "\"Last September, I watched a video of qualifying for World Cup 1998 and laughed when I saw Nick Barmby had played for England as recently as the 1997 match against Moldova. How my attitude has changed,\" admitted Andrew Perrins in the aftermath of England's shambolic performance against Malta. But he wasn't the only one to undergo a change of heart. Over the weekend we received another huge batch of emails from Guardian Unlimited readers outlining your ideal England team. In short, Barmby, 3-5-2 and Steven Gerrard are smoking hot, while the Neville brothers, Paul Ince and Alan Shearer are certainly not. Is Nick Barmby really England's latest saviour/left-winger/left wing-back/play-maker? (*delete as appropriate). According to most of our recent emails the answer is a definite yes. Andy Dawson summed up your mood, writing: \"I would play Barmby on the left-wing, especially after the way he played against Malta. He's the only player to have looked comfortable on the left in an England shirt for some time.\" Some of you went further, with Graham Lacey going as far to call him \"the probable England playmaker.\" For many of you the man who should give way is Steve McManaman. \"Barmby has played himself into the team with two telling performances against Ukraine and Malta.

The attempted coup in the Solomon Islands came less than three weeks after a similar upheaval in Fiji, where racist rebels are holding the elected prime minister hostage. The Solomons rebels, who appear to have been inspired by the Fijian uprising, struck swiftly in the early hours of the morning. They seized prime minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alua and are holding him hostage at an unknown location in the capital, Honiara. Both rebellions have laid bare the ugly ethnic tensions underlying life in the supposedly idyllic tropical nations of Oceania. In Fiji, the rebels claim to champion the 51 per cent indigenous majority over the 44 per cent minority of ethnic Indians. In the Solomons, the ethnic divide is more complicated. Ninety five per cent of the 455,000-strong population are Melanesian by race, but are divided by bitter regional and linguistic rivalries (though the lingua franca is pidgin, the Solomon Islanders speak a staggering 120 different indigenous languages). The rebel group which overran police stations and other key points this morning calls itself the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF). It claims to represent the Malaitan minority on the main island, Guadalcanal. For more than a year, the MEF has confronted not only police and other security forces (the Solomon Islands have no conventional army) but also a second rebel group, the Isatabu Freedom Movement (IFM). The IFM group has run a vicious, intimidating campaign to force thousands of migrants on Guadalcanal back to their native island of Malaita. The confused and potentially bloody situation in Honiara has raised acute concern in Australia and New Zealand, whose governments are already alarmed by the near collapse of order in Fiji. There were signals from the Fijian capital, Suva, this morning that the country's new military rulers are losing patience with the flamboyant rebel leader George Speight. Speight's motley forces are holding some 35 hostages, including the elected ethnic Indian prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry. All the rebels' main demands have been conceded: the prime minister has been deposed, the constitution has been scrapped, and Speight and his cohorts have been promised an amnesty. But the military is digging in its heels over Speight's latest demands for a top job in a new government. Any such concession would be certain to prompt international trade sanctions, and this morning the martial law regime said the rebels must lay down their arms and release their hostages immediately.

A magnitude 7 earthquake is capable of causing widespread and heavy damage in urban areas.</p> <p>Ali Muchtar, Bengkulu health department chief, said 58 people were confirmed dead. Almost 500 people had been reported injured, 255 seriously.</p> <p>A police officer in Bengkulu said the death toll was expected to rise further as volunteers and emergency workers searched through ruined buildings.</p> <p>Witnesses said local hospitals were overwhelmed with injured people and were struggling to cope as few staff members had arrived at work. Doctors in Bengkulu treated injured people in an outside parking lot, fearing that aftershocks might bring down the state hospital, the official Antara news agency reported.</p> <p>Electricity and water supplies had been cut, and many phone lines were down. Medical supplies were running low. The city's airport was closed because of damage to its communications equipment and passenger terminal.</p> <p>\"Many houses have collapsed, and the walls on bigger buildings have been fractured. I helped save three of my neighbours who were trapped under rubble,\" said Edy, a resident of Bengkulu, which is 60 miles east of the quake's epicenter.</p> <p>Seismologists said the tremor was centred beneath the Indian Ocean, 400 miles northwest of Jakarta. A magnitude 6 aftershock hit 11 minutes behind the quake, and 53 smaller tremors were recorded before 6am today (2300 yesterday GMT), frightening residents and hampering rescuers, Indonesian seismologists said.</p> <p>The quake, one of the strongest recorded in Indonesia in recent years, was felt across much of the western half of the archipelago nation, including the capital, Jakarta, and the neighboring island state of Singapore, where many residents fled their homes as the earthquake rattled high-rise buildings.</p> <p>The US Geological Survey said the quake's epicenter was about 20.5 miles beneath the floor of the Indian Ocean, very shallow in geological terms. However, there were no immediate reports of a tsunami, a massive wave that can be caused by an earthquake or volcanic eruption. In December 1992, a magnitude 7 earthquake triggered a tsunami that killed about 2,500 people on Flores island in eastern Indonesia.</p> <p>Indonesia, the world's biggest archipelago nation, sits on major fault lines and is prone to frequent seismic upheavals. In Jakarta, President Abdurrahman Wahid offered no immediate emergency response, saying instead that his government had to assess the problem.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.antara.co.id/english.asp\" target=\"new\">Antara, Indonesia's national news agency</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.indocenter.co.id/\" target=\"new\">Indonesia Internet Information Centre</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.earthquakenews.com/\" target=\"new\">Earthquake News</a><br> <a href=\"http://wwwneic.cr.usgs.gov/\" target=\"new\"> USGS (US Geological Survey) National Earthquake Information Center</a><br> <a href=\"http://quake.wr.usgs.gov/\" target=\"new\"> USGS Earthquake Information </a></p>",

Widespread panic was reported in Bengkulu, a city of about 1.2m near the tremor's epicentre, as people dug through the rubble of ruined buildings in search of bodies and trapped survivors. The Indonesian Meteorological and Geophysical Service said the quake, measuring 7.3 magnitude, hit at 11:29pm yesterday (1629 GMT) and lasted for several minutes, jolting people from their beds. The US Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado, estimated its magnitude as 7.9. A magnitude 7 earthquake is capable of causing widespread and heavy damage in urban areas. Ali Muchtar, Bengkulu health department chief, said 58 people were confirmed dead. Almost 500 people had been reported injured, 255 seriously. A police officer in Bengkulu said the death toll was expected to rise further as volunteers and emergency workers searched through ruined buildings. Witnesses said local hospitals were overwhelmed with injured people and were struggling to cope as few staff members had arrived at work. Doctors in Bengkulu treated injured people in an outside parking lot, fearing that aftershocks might bring down the state hospital, the official Antara news agency reported. Electricity and water supplies had been cut, and many phone lines were down. Medical supplies were running low. The city's airport was closed because of damage to its communications equipment and passenger terminal. \"Many houses have collapsed, and the walls on bigger buildings have been fractured. I helped save three of my neighbours who were trapped under rubble,\" said Edy, a resident of Bengkulu, which is 60 miles east of the quake's epicenter. Seismologists said the tremor was centred beneath the Indian Ocean, 400 miles northwest of Jakarta. A magnitude 6 aftershock hit 11 minutes behind the quake, and 53 smaller tremors were recorded before 6am today (2300 yesterday GMT), frightening residents and hampering rescuers, Indonesian seismologists said. The quake, one of the strongest recorded in Indonesia in recent years, was felt across much of the western half of the archipelago nation, including the capital, Jakarta, and the neighboring island state of Singapore, where many residents fled their homes as the earthquake rattled high-rise buildings. The US Geological Survey said the quake's epicenter was about 20.5 miles beneath the floor of the Indian Ocean, very shallow in geological terms. However, there were no immediate reports of a tsunami, a massive wave that can be caused by an earthquake or volcanic eruption. In December 1992, a magnitude 7 earthquake triggered a tsunami that killed about 2,500 people on Flores island in eastern Indonesia. Indonesia, the world's biggest archipelago nation, sits on major fault lines and is prone to frequent seismic upheavals. In Jakarta, President Abdurrahman Wahid offered no immediate emergency response, saying instead that his government had to assess the problem.

While I do not doubt the pain that toothache can bring, a more self-aware man would have realised that this simply isn't dignified. Bravely struggling against disease can make for a moving and uplifting memoir, but bravely struggling against toothache is never going to lift you into the pantheon of stoic heroes.\"</p> <p> Sutcliffe felt decidedly short-changed: \"Despite the insistence of his blurb-writer that this is an autobiography, Amis is curiously reticent about himself and his life.

Parts of it do not quite succeed, particularly the sections dealing with the author's first cousin, Lucy Partington, who disappeared in 1973, and was later discovered to have been one of Frederick West's victim's - but then, how could such horror be written about successfully?\"</p> <p> <strong>Terence Blacker</strong>, in the Sunday Times, also had reservations about the treatment of Lucy Partington's murder: \"Again and again, throughout the book, he returns to memories and thoughts of Lucy Partington. It is no discredit to him that his careful, heartfelt tribute - the text closes with a letter to her mother, complete with kisses at the end - somewhat unbalances the book.\"</p> <p> In all other respects, Blacker thought the book masterly: \"In a deceptively cunning narrative weave, casting backwards and forwards from his childhood to his middle age, from his father's marriages to his own, he worries away at the polarities of innocence and experience, love and death. He writes movingly and, as far as one can tell, perceptively about the family relationships which have dominated his life, about his friendship with Saul Bellow, about the discovery of his lost daughter Delilah Seale after 21 years, about his love for his children.\"</p> <p> <strong>James Wood</strong>, in the <strong>Guardian</strong>, also offered a lyrical encomium to Amis's attempt to come to terms with the truths of his life. \"Experience is a beautiful, and beautifully strange book, and it is unlike anything one expected.

But Experience is not quite a memoir, nor is it quite a portrait of his father, nor is it really an autobiography. It is an escape from memoir; indeed, an escape into privacy. In the very book which might, at first glance, seem most exhibitionist, most shamelessly metropolitan, Amis has softly retreated to the provinces of himself. His book often reads like a letter to his family and closest friends. It is sometimes embarrassing to read; the ordinary reader feels voyeuristic, at times almost uninvited, but very moved.

      "body": "<b>What is an NHS consultant?</b> <br> Ask a medical student, and you'll get a one-word answer: \"God\". The consultant is the top rank of specialist hospital doctor - the cornerstone of the health service as negotiated by consultant leaders at its inception in 1948, and the doctor to whom your GP may refer you if he or she can't resolve your problem themselves. <p><b>Why are consultants in the news?</b><br> Unfortunately, for all the wrong reasons. The medical profession has been rocked by a string of scandals involving consultant surgeons - such as James Wisheart, the consultant largely responsible for the high number of deaths during paediatric heart surgery at Bristol Royal Infirmary in the late 1980s and early 1990s; and Rodney Ledward, the self-styled \"fastest gynaecologist in the south-east\", who botched a string of hysterectomies during his 16 years in the William Harvey hospital, Ashford, Kent. The inquiry report into the Ledward case has criticised the \"closed and closet atmosphere\" in which juniors were reluctant to question their seniors - a situation with which doctors in many hospitals will be familiar.</p> <p><b>What is the government doing?</b><br> Since his days as health minister in 1997, health secretary Alan Milburn has seen curbing consultant power as fundamental to NHS reform. He wants to make inroads into consultant self-regulation, currently the responsibility of the general medical council. But it also comes down to money - the government wants a new grade of lower-paid specialist doctors, which in the long term means fewer consultants and more work done for less.</p> <p><b>How much are consultants paid at the moment?</b><br> A consultant of five years' standing is currently paid \u00a363,640 basic. This can be topped up by a \"distinction award\", the most valuable of which is worth an additional 95% of basic salary (awarded to a privileged few). But consultants can also choose to sacrifice one-eleventh of their NHS salary in return for the freedom to earn an unrestricted amount from private practice. Rodney Ledward earned lucrative fees this way - but if the government were to achieve its stated aim of reducing NHS waiting times to zero, much of the private market would disappear.</p> <p><b>So what do the consultants think of the government plans? </b><br> Thy are not impressed. They fear the government, which has put them under enormous pressure to meet its targets on reducing waiting lists, is now betraying the majority by capitalising on the failings of a rogue few. At the British Medical Association's annual consultants conference last Thursday, they unanimously rejected the government's plans for a new specialist grade. But they did also pass a motion of no confidence in the general medical council, with BMA consultant leaders claiming it neither protected patients nor guided doctors.</p> <p><b>So what does the future hold?</b><br> Consultant leaders are currently in negotiations with the government over reforming their contract for the first time since 1948. While they will probably give way on professional self-regulation, they also have much to gain: the European working-time directive demands a maximum 48-hour week, far less than most consultants currently work. If this were followed strictly, they warn, the health service as we know it would collapse. Whether this is true or not, one thing is for sure: the power of the consultant is by no means at an end.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.bma.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">BMA</a><br><a href=\"http://www.gmc-uk.org\" target=\"_new\"> GMC</a><br><a href=\"http://www.bristol-inquiry.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Bristol Inquiry</a><br><a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk\" target=\"_new\">Department of Health</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hospitaldoctor.cc\" target=\"_new\">Hospital Doctor newspaper</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "What is an NHS consultant? Ask a medical student, and you'll get a one-word answer: \"God\". The consultant is the top rank of specialist hospital doctor - the cornerstone of the health service as negotiated by consultant leaders at its inception in 1948, and the doctor to whom your GP may refer you if he or she can't resolve your problem themselves. Why are consultants in the news? Unfortunately, for all the wrong reasons. The medical profession has been rocked by a string of scandals involving consultant surgeons - such as James Wisheart, the consultant largely responsible for the high number of deaths during paediatric heart surgery at Bristol Royal Infirmary in the late 1980s and early 1990s; and Rodney Ledward, the self-styled \"fastest gynaecologist in the south-east\", who botched a string of hysterectomies during his 16 years in the William Harvey hospital, Ashford, Kent. The inquiry report into the Ledward case has criticised the \"closed and closet atmosphere\" in which juniors were reluctant to question their seniors - a situation with which doctors in many hospitals will be familiar. What is the government doing? Since his days as health minister in 1997, health secretary Alan Milburn has seen curbing consultant power as fundamental to NHS reform. He wants to make inroads into consultant self-regulation, currently the responsibility of the general medical council. But it also comes down to money - the government wants a new grade of lower-paid specialist doctors, which in the long term means fewer consultants and more work done for less. How much are consultants paid at the moment? A consultant of five years' standing is currently paid \u00a363,640 basic. This can be topped up by a \"distinction award\", the most valuable of which is worth an additional 95% of basic salary (awarded to a privileged few). But consultants can also choose to sacrifice one-eleventh of their NHS salary in return for the freedom to earn an unrestricted amount from private practice. Rodney Ledward earned lucrative fees this way - but if the government were to achieve its stated aim of reducing NHS waiting times to zero, much of the private market would disappear. So what do the consultants think of the government plans? Thy are not impressed. They fear the government, which has put them under enormous pressure to meet its targets on reducing waiting lists, is now betraying the majority by capitalising on the failings of a rogue few. At the British Medical Association's annual consultants conference last Thursday, they unanimously rejected the government's plans for a new specialist grade. But they did also pass a motion of no confidence in the general medical council, with BMA consultant leaders claiming it neither protected patients nor guided doctors. So what does the future hold? Consultant leaders are currently in negotiations with the government over reforming their contract for the first time since 1948. While they will probably give way on professional self-regulation, they also have much to gain: the European working-time directive demands a maximum 48-hour week, far less than most consultants currently work. If this were followed strictly, they warn, the health service as we know it would collapse. Whether this is true or not, one thing is for sure: the power of the consultant is by no means at an end.

      "body": "<p>On the 25th anniversary of the referendum on British membership of what we then called the \"Common Market\", it is tempting to ask what has Europe done for us? Actually, it has done a lot - for British jobs, trade, and civil liberties. That's not to mention the absence of the Franco-German conflicts that marred the first half of the 20th century.</p> <p>If we look back on the major events and trends in British politics since the 1975 referendum - the winter of discontent, Thatcherism, the formation of the SDP, Falklands war, the miners' strike, Black Wednesday, Maastricht, the 1997 general election, boom and bust - at no point in those 25 years did a British PM (Heath apart) take the lead in arguing the positive benefits of British membership of Europe.</p> <p>That is the saddest indictment of the past two and half decades in British politics. And it is becoming the saddest indictment of the present government that the prime minister has not bucked the trend.</p> <p>British leaders could have said, on more than one occasion, that we are a European nation, with centuries of history, shared values and culture linking us to the continent. They could have argued that we are a European nation because of our growing trade links with it. And they could have pointed out that other potential collaborators with Britain, such as the United States, Australia and New Zealand, are looking increasingly towards Asia rather than us for their economic futures.</p> <p>In a world where access to large free markets is key, Europe is the only show in town. Yet too often, we opt to work in political suburbia. The tone was set when we originally decided that the Common Market was something that needn't trouble us. Ever since, a familiar pattern has been followed. When any move forward looks likely to happen in the rest of Europe, we tend to say that it won't happen.</p> <p>When it happens, we say it won't work. When it works, we say we don't need to be part of it. Then, finally, we realise that we have to be part of it, and enter on terms that are far worse than if we had joined earlier - with the result that the image of Britain in Europe tends to be one of an apparently sceptical Harold Wilson seeking renegotiation, or a handbag-wielding Margaret Thatcher demanding our money back. We lost out in 1957, lost out subsequently and we must not repeat such mistakes again.</p> <p>Europe has a real impact on real life in Britain. One of the major obstacles to Britain joining the euro is the overvalued pound. But we can't really sort that out for the long-term until we commit to the euro. The government has failed to argue that case and stands culpable as a result.</p> <p>The costs of this failure of leadership are seen in the decline in public support for Europe. There is a steadily decreasing interest in Europe from the voters.</p> <p>Nearly 65% voiced an opinion in the 1975 referendum. Yet since the \"high\" of the 1989 and 1994 European election when 36.8% voted, interest has dropped off markedly - with under 25% voting last year. At the same time, hostility to the euro has increased. The regular Mori poll on whether Britain should join showed just over 20% against in 1992. The figure is now regularly over 30%. Yet the same polling shows that people would be much more willing to support entry if the government takes a strong position. The government could make a difference - if only it had the political courage.</p> <p>We will continue to lose out if the prime minister doesn't stand up for what he must know is in Britain's long-term, vital, social, political and economic interest. That means setting a date for entry to the euro, consulting the British people through a referendum, and if the people agree, making preparations for British entry two to three years down the line.</p> <p>I have put this point frequently at Prime Minister's Questions. The PM likes to respond with a cheap jibe, saying that William Hague would never join, and that the Liberal Democrats want to join now.</p> <p>The former looks increasingly accurate.

      "bodyText": "On the 25th anniversary of the referendum on British membership of what we then called the \"Common Market\", it is tempting to ask what has Europe done for us? Actually, it has done a lot - for British jobs, trade, and civil liberties. That's not to mention the absence of the Franco-German conflicts that marred the first half of the 20th century. If we look back on the major events and trends in British politics since the 1975 referendum - the winter of discontent, Thatcherism, the formation of the SDP, Falklands war, the miners' strike, Black Wednesday, Maastricht, the 1997 general election, boom and bust - at no point in those 25 years did a British PM (Heath apart) take the lead in arguing the positive benefits of British membership of Europe. That is the saddest indictment of the past two and half decades in British politics. And it is becoming the saddest indictment of the present government that the prime minister has not bucked the trend. British leaders could have said, on more than one occasion, that we are a European nation, with centuries of history, shared values and culture linking us to the continent. They could have argued that we are a European nation because of our growing trade links with it. And they could have pointed out that other potential collaborators with Britain, such as the United States, Australia and New Zealand, are looking increasingly towards Asia rather than us for their economic futures. In a world where access to large free markets is key, Europe is the only show in town. Yet too often, we opt to work in political suburbia. The tone was set when we originally decided that the Common Market was something that needn't trouble us. Ever since, a familiar pattern has been followed. When any move forward looks likely to happen in the rest of Europe, we tend to say that it won't happen. When it happens, we say it won't work. When it works, we say we don't need to be part of it. Then, finally, we realise that we have to be part of it, and enter on terms that are far worse than if we had joined earlier - with the result that the image of Britain in Europe tends to be one of an apparently sceptical Harold Wilson seeking renegotiation, or a handbag-wielding Margaret Thatcher demanding our money back. We lost out in 1957, lost out subsequently and we must not repeat such mistakes again. Europe has a real impact on real life in Britain. One of the major obstacles to Britain joining the euro is the overvalued pound. But we can't really sort that out for the long-term until we commit to the euro. The government has failed to argue that case and stands culpable as a result. The costs of this failure of leadership are seen in the decline in public support for Europe. There is a steadily decreasing interest in Europe from the voters. Nearly 65% voiced an opinion in the 1975 referendum. Yet since the \"high\" of the 1989 and 1994 European election when 36.8% voted, interest has dropped off markedly - with under 25% voting last year. At the same time, hostility to the euro has increased. The regular Mori poll on whether Britain should join showed just over 20% against in 1992. The figure is now regularly over 30%. Yet the same polling shows that people would be much more willing to support entry if the government takes a strong position. The government could make a difference - if only it had the political courage. We will continue to lose out if the prime minister doesn't stand up for what he must know is in Britain's long-term, vital, social, political and economic interest. That means setting a date for entry to the euro, consulting the British people through a referendum, and if the people agree, making preparations for British entry two to three years down the line. I have put this point frequently at Prime Minister's Questions. The PM likes to respond with a cheap jibe, saying that William Hague would never join, and that the Liberal Democrats want to join now. The former looks increasingly accurate. But the latter has never been true. The PM's own proclaimed policy is to go in when it suits Britain. He is right - we shouldn't join in any circumstances. But we will never get there by doing nothing. If Labour is serious about acting in Britain's interest, then it should be adopting the Liberal Democrat policy, not abusing it. And if the government doesn't act soon, then public opinion may have been lost forever and the euro ship may have sailed. Then we will never be able to join the euro. \u0095 Charles Kennedy is leader of the Liberal Democrats. comment@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair must stake his credibility on winning a referendum to take Britain into the European single currency to have a hope of reversing public scepticism, a leading pollster argues today. Bob Worcester, head of Mori, suggests in a pamphlet for a Blairite think tank that the image of those leading the fight for entry to the single currency will prove more significant in swaying public opinion than economic arguments. Yesterday the former chancellor Lord Jenkins, in a speech to mark the 25th anniversary of the vote in which Britain decided to stay in the common market, warned the prime minister that he must start working now to win round public opinion. \"Too many prime ministers have damaged their reputations by equivocation on Europe,\" Lord Jenkins, a confidant of Mr Blair, told a European Movement conference in Nottingham. \"I pray that Mr Blair will handle matters more decisively.\" Professor Worcester argues in the pamphlet that, even with the backing of \"credible leaders\" such as Mr Blair, chancellor Gordon Brown, and the Conservative pro-Europeans Michael Heseltine and Kenneth Clarke, the \"yes to the euro\" camp will need the greatest shift in public opinion since the war to win a referendum. Euro supporters will need to get their vote out, target their campaign on young swing voters and not rely on business leaders. His analysis for the Foreign Policy Centre, whose patron is Mr Blair and whose president is the pro-Euro foreign secretary, Robin Cook, comes as single currency enthusiasts are putting concerted pressure on the government to launch an early campaign for euro entry. Frustration is bubbling among supporters within and outside the government over its caution, with tensions emerging publicly by way of briefings and counter-briefings involving cabinet ministers in rival camps. As well as Mr Cook, ministers keen to join the euro include the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, and the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, while Mr Brown is cooler on the issue. Downing Street yesterday denied suggestions that a specialist \"euro unit\" was being set up in the Cabinet Office to allow Mr Blair to take control of European issues and end ministerial feuding. However, he is expected to appoint Sir Stephen Wall, Britain's ambassador to the EU, to replace the departing David Bostock as head of the European secretariat, the Cabinet Office-based unit that co-ordinates EU policy across government departments. The former prime minister Edward Heath yesterday said pro-Europeans should shoulder some of the blame for the public's failure to appreciate the increased jobs, trade and influence that closer ties with Europe had brought. Claiming that successive governments had failed to make the European case, he called for a new effort to convince the public of the benefits of joining a single currency to counter \"the cumulative effect of 25 years of anti-European propaganda\". Mr Clarke, former Tory chancellor, who is irritated at being left to fight the pro-euro case without public government backing, yesterday told the European Movement conference that Britain would start losing investors because of its failure to say it will join the euro. \"Decisions for the future will be taken now to avoid the risk of investing in Britain when the exchange rate might move up or down against the euro at any time, affecting the prices of exports and imports and the value of investment,\" he said. But a spokesman for the Business for Sterling group said: \"This is the roar of the euro dinosaurs still wedded to a policy invented in the last century and having no understanding of what a modern economy needs in the internet age.\"",

Her work for her own company, the Rambert and the London Contemporary Dance Theatre has been internationally acclaimed. Susan Loppert's work on art therapy, however, is much less celebrated. Since 1993 she has filled the Chelsea and Westminster hospital in London with 1,000 paintings, sculptures and mobiles and introduced weekly programmes of music, theatre and puppetry that have become, according to the judges, \"a model for all hospitals, here and abroad\". Outside classical music circles, Peter Cropper, founder of the Sheffield International Music Festival, is not well known. Like all the other nominees, he is a great populariser, insisting on down-to-earth introduction to pieces, and having world-class musicians perform in the round and mingling with audiences. Sabrina Guinness, a scion of the brewing family, challenged Anneka Rice to build a studio in west London in four days for her YCTV company which trains disadvantaged young people, and those at risk of committing crime, to work in television. Programmes made by the young people have been shown on the BBC, Sky and Carlton. Colin Tweedy, of Arts &amp; Business, who persuaded Prudential to sponsor the awards, said they pointed up how the arts are a powerful motor for change. Each of the six nominees gets \u00a320,000 for their own causes. The winner, to be announced on June 28, will receive \u00a3100,000 in total.",

Their release date will be set by the lord chief justice Lord Bingham, who is currently considering their case. Eight-year sentences were imposed on Thompson and Venables by the trial judge. They were later raised to 10 years by the lord chief justice and further increased by the then home secretary, Michael Howard, to 15 years. That tariff was overturned in December after a ruling by the European court of human rights. Jack Straw, the home secretary, then asked the lord chief justice to set a new term. A Home Office spokeswoman said no decision would be made on where the killers would be accommodated until he had reached his decision, but they could legally stay in local authority care until they were 19. A prison service spokeswoman said: \"At the moment they are likely to stay in local authority care until the final decision is made by the lord chief justice.

It would also mean they would no longer be locked in their rooms at night.

According to a CBS news report last night, an Iranian defector, named as Ahmad Behbahani, who is said to have coordinated Iranian terrorist operations for a decade, has documents to prove his claims. The CIA is debriefing Mr Behbahani, now in protective custody in Turkey, the CBS News TV programme 60 Minutes reported. The two Libyans, Abdel Baset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifah Fhimah, are accused of planting the bomb on Pan Am 103, and are now being tried before Scottish judges at the former US airbase of Camp Zeist in the Netherlands. The two, described by the prosecution as members of the Libyan intelligence services, deny the charges, blaming two Syrian-based Palestinian factions, one with links to Iran. Intriguingly, defence lawyers have also told the court they will seek to incriminate a crown witness, Parviz Taheri. Nothing is known about him, but his name is Iranian. The explosion over Lockerbie in Scotland killed all 259 Pan Am passengers and crew and 11 people on the ground. Suggestions that Iran was involved are not new. Early on it was assumed that the incident was in retaliation for the downing of an Iranian airliner over the Gulf in July 1988. Iran, then still ruled by the revolutionary leader Ayatollah Khomeini, vowed that the skies would \"rain blood\" after the USS Vincennes shot down the Iran Air flight, killing 290 people. Tehran, master minding the holding of western hostages in Lebanon, was thought to have ordered the destruction of the Pan Am airliner with the help of the Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of PalestineGeneral Command. It seemed equally plausible to assume that Libya might have wanted to avenge the US and British bombing of Libya in 1986, itself retaliation for an alleged Libyan terrorist attack on US servicemen in Berlin. In November 1991, the two Libyans were indicted and handed over for trial last year. Hearings began at Camp Zeist last month and are scheduled to last for at least a year. Scottish legal authorities have said that they will punish any contempt of court, though the absence of a jury means that the case is taking place in a legal no man's land. Media reports have cast doubts over a Swiss witness who made the timer that triggered the bomb and a Libyan defector now living in the US who was said to have seen the accused loading the bomb on to a feeder flight in Malta. Other theories have suggested that Palestinian terrorists infiltrated a US intelligence operation which used Pan Am Flight 103 to smuggle heroin, in a complex dirty-tricks, drugs-for-hostages deal.

      "byline": "James Meek  and Michael Ellison in New York",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Even as the scientific world holds its breath to see which of two rival teams will be first to decode the \"book of life\", the secret of our genes, researchers in the US are building a computer 50 times more powerful than anything available today to delve beyond genes into the nuts and bolts mechanics of human existence. </p> <p>In what will be seen by some as a promise and others as a threat, the supercomputer, nicknamed Blue Gene, could show the way to the holy grail of biology - how to bridge the gap between man as a bag of chemicals and man as a conscious, creative being. </p> <p>Long before that the designers of the new computer hope it will lead to lucrative, lifesaving medical breakthroughs, building on the data produced by the Human Genome Project and its private-sector counterpart, Celera Genomics. </p> <p>Six months after IBM announced it was spending the equivalent of \u00a360m on the project, its full scale and importance is starting to emerge. Blue Gene has 1,000 times the capacity of Deep Blue, which defeated the world chess champion Garry Kasparov three years ago, and about 2m times more muscle than today's desktop PCs. </p> <p>It will use that muscle for a single, deceptively banal task - working out how a single human protein is built from the atoms up. </p> <p>It might not sound much. But it is the fundamental mechanism of life, and some of the brightest stars of biochemistry have been beating their heads against it for years, without success. Existing computers cannot even accurately model the behaviour of simple water molecules in the human body. </p> <p>IBM is aiming at a machine that will be able to tackle one quadrillion operations per second, making it easily the fastest computer in the world. </p> <p>\"Breakthroughs in computers and information technology are now creating new frontiers in biology,\" said Paul Horn, senior vice-president of IBM research. </p> <p>\"One day you're going to be able to walk into a doctor's office and have a computer analyse a tissue sample, identify the pathogen that ails you and then instantly prescribe a treatment best suited to your specific illness and individual genetic make-up.\" </p> <p>But even working at a pace 40 times greater than that of today's 40 fastest computers operating in tandem, it will take the IBM machine a year to produce the answer for just one protein. </p> <p>Ever since the power of supercomputers began creeping towards parity with the human brain, commentators have speculated that machines could eventually rival and surpass our own intelligence. </p> <p>IBM's announcement shows the way to a subtler but no less momentous way computers could determine our fate - by replicating, in their processors, the entire chemical reaction that is a human organism. </p> <p>Although theologians and religious believers would disagree, most biologists believe human beings are no more or less than very large and complex collections of atoms - atoms that should join and separate in a predictable way. </p> <p>It would take computing power far in excess of anything contemplated today to simulate the interaction of all the trillions of atoms in the human body. One scientist likened it to seeking a perfect weather forecast. </p> <p>Yet Blue Gene is a tiny step in that direction. Its unprecedented power will use the basic laws of physics and chemistry to calculate, a step at a time, how atoms must join to form one of the basic building blocks of life, a big molecule called a protein. </p> <p>On that submicroscopic scale, our metabolisms work at blinding speed. Blue Gene will use its calculating might to work out the shifting of atoms in slices of time a few quadrillionths of a second long. </p> <p>\"Nature does this day in and day out, second by second, and has done it for billions of years,\" said IBM's Sharon Nunes. \"We really want to understand the fundamental why and how.\" </p> <p>If genes, clustered in the centre of the cells of our bodies, make up the recipe book of life - the human genome - proteins are what the body cooks up from the recipes. </p> <p>Scientists are expected to announce any day that they have cracked the code of the human genome. It is an extraordinary landmark in our understanding of what we are, but it marks the beginning of a massive new effort to understand how the products of the genes, the proteins, work. </p> <p>Proteins - hormones, enzymes, antibodies - are the messengers, labourers and warriors of the body. </p> <p>They are made up of several hundred smaller molecules called amino acids. The unique shape these amino acids form when they get together according to a gene's instructions is critical to the protein's job, but scientists still do not understand why what they call \"protein folding\" happens as it does. </p> <p>When it was first mooted in the 1980s, no-one imagined the Human Genome Project would be completed as swiftly or as cheaply as it has been. The unforeseen factor was the vast expansion in computing power available to scientists, who were able to automate much of the laborious nitty-gritty of gene hunting. </p> <p>Now some researchers are arguing a similar effort should be launched to isolate and characterise every protein in the human body - a \"human proteome project\". </p> <p>Since the 30,000 to 100,000 human genes may each produce more than one protein, that could mean identifying hundreds of thousands of proteins - a massive task. </p> <p>With billions of dollars of investment at stake, the same public-private funding and access problems which have dogged the Genome Project are already surfacing in debate about the Proteome Project. </p> <p>A leading US proteomics entrepreneur, Leigh Anderson of Large Scale Biology Corporation, told the journal Nature last year: \"Large-scale proteome research should be carried out in companies rather than through government-sponsored projects.\" </p> <p>But Tim Hubbard, a protein specialist now among the leaders of the British end of the publicly funded Human Genome Project, said US government funds were starting to flow into the field, with the UK interested. </p> <p>\"IBM is realising that we are going in the direction of high-performance computing, and they want to get in on the act. It's a good strategy,\" he said. </p> <p><strong>From Babbage to Windows</strong></p> <p><strong> 1820-32</strong> Mechanical computing: Charles Babbage designs the first mechanical computers, the analytical engine (to calculate mathematical tables) and the difference engine which, had it been built, would have been the first computer </p> <p><strong> 1890</strong> Punched cards: Herman Hollerith founds the data processing industry with an electric-powered machine based on punched cards, which wins a competition to process data for the US census. Hollerith's company becomes part of IBM, and punched cards - introduced by Joseph-Marie Jacquard to automate weaving in 1805 - dominate data processing until the 1970s </p> <p><strong> 1946</strong> Valve-based computing: John Presper Eckert and John W Mauchly complete Eniac (electronic numerical integrator analyser and computer), the first fully electronic programmable computer, for the US army. It has 18,000 valves (vacuum tubes), and weighs 30 tons </p> <p><strong> 1947</strong> Transistors: The Bell Laboratory scientists William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain develop the germanium transistor. This leads to a new generation of smaller, faster, computers, as well as the portable transistor radio (1952) </p> <p><strong> 1958</strong> Microchips: Americans Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce invent the integrated circuit, which enables vast numbers of transistors and other devices to be put on a single silicon chip. The circuits take over the computer industry </p> <p><strong> 1965</strong> Supercomputing: Seymour Cray develops the CD6600, the first supercomputer, at Control Data Corporation. Cray leaves to design a series of machines that run at the highest possible speed </p> <p><strong> 1971</strong> Microprocessors: Marcian \"Ted\" Hoff designs the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor or \"computer on a chip\".

      "bodyText": "Even as the scientific world holds its breath to see which of two rival teams will be first to decode the \"book of life\", the secret of our genes, researchers in the US are building a computer 50 times more powerful than anything available today to delve beyond genes into the nuts and bolts mechanics of human existence. In what will be seen by some as a promise and others as a threat, the supercomputer, nicknamed Blue Gene, could show the way to the holy grail of biology - how to bridge the gap between man as a bag of chemicals and man as a conscious, creative being. Long before that the designers of the new computer hope it will lead to lucrative, lifesaving medical breakthroughs, building on the data produced by the Human Genome Project and its private-sector counterpart, Celera Genomics. Six months after IBM announced it was spending the equivalent of \u00a360m on the project, its full scale and importance is starting to emerge. Blue Gene has 1,000 times the capacity of Deep Blue, which defeated the world chess champion Garry Kasparov three years ago, and about 2m times more muscle than today's desktop PCs. It will use that muscle for a single, deceptively banal task - working out how a single human protein is built from the atoms up. It might not sound much. But it is the fundamental mechanism of life, and some of the brightest stars of biochemistry have been beating their heads against it for years, without success. Existing computers cannot even accurately model the behaviour of simple water molecules in the human body. IBM is aiming at a machine that will be able to tackle one quadrillion operations per second, making it easily the fastest computer in the world. \"Breakthroughs in computers and information technology are now creating new frontiers in biology,\" said Paul Horn, senior vice-president of IBM research. \"One day you're going to be able to walk into a doctor's office and have a computer analyse a tissue sample, identify the pathogen that ails you and then instantly prescribe a treatment best suited to your specific illness and individual genetic make-up.\" But even working at a pace 40 times greater than that of today's 40 fastest computers operating in tandem, it will take the IBM machine a year to produce the answer for just one protein. Ever since the power of supercomputers began creeping towards parity with the human brain, commentators have speculated that machines could eventually rival and surpass our own intelligence. IBM's announcement shows the way to a subtler but no less momentous way computers could determine our fate - by replicating, in their processors, the entire chemical reaction that is a human organism. Although theologians and religious believers would disagree, most biologists believe human beings are no more or less than very large and complex collections of atoms - atoms that should join and separate in a predictable way. It would take computing power far in excess of anything contemplated today to simulate the interaction of all the trillions of atoms in the human body. One scientist likened it to seeking a perfect weather forecast. Yet Blue Gene is a tiny step in that direction. Its unprecedented power will use the basic laws of physics and chemistry to calculate, a step at a time, how atoms must join to form one of the basic building blocks of life, a big molecule called a protein. On that submicroscopic scale, our metabolisms work at blinding speed. Blue Gene will use its calculating might to work out the shifting of atoms in slices of time a few quadrillionths of a second long. \"Nature does this day in and day out, second by second, and has done it for billions of years,\" said IBM's Sharon Nunes. \"We really want to understand the fundamental why and how.\" If genes, clustered in the centre of the cells of our bodies, make up the recipe book of life - the human genome - proteins are what the body cooks up from the recipes. Scientists are expected to announce any day that they have cracked the code of the human genome. It is an extraordinary landmark in our understanding of what we are, but it marks the beginning of a massive new effort to understand how the products of the genes, the proteins, work. Proteins - hormones, enzymes, antibodies - are the messengers, labourers and warriors of the body. They are made up of several hundred smaller molecules called amino acids. The unique shape these amino acids form when they get together according to a gene's instructions is critical to the protein's job, but scientists still do not understand why what they call \"protein folding\" happens as it does. When it was first mooted in the 1980s, no-one imagined the Human Genome Project would be completed as swiftly or as cheaply as it has been. The unforeseen factor was the vast expansion in computing power available to scientists, who were able to automate much of the laborious nitty-gritty of gene hunting. Now some researchers are arguing a similar effort should be launched to isolate and characterise every protein in the human body - a \"human proteome project\". Since the 30,000 to 100,000 human genes may each produce more than one protein, that could mean identifying hundreds of thousands of proteins - a massive task. With billions of dollars of investment at stake, the same public-private funding and access problems which have dogged the Genome Project are already surfacing in debate about the Proteome Project. A leading US proteomics entrepreneur, Leigh Anderson of Large Scale Biology Corporation, told the journal Nature last year: \"Large-scale proteome research should be carried out in companies rather than through government-sponsored projects.\" But Tim Hubbard, a protein specialist now among the leaders of the British end of the publicly funded Human Genome Project, said US government funds were starting to flow into the field, with the UK interested. \"IBM is realising that we are going in the direction of high-performance computing, and they want to get in on the act. It's a good strategy,\" he said. From Babbage to Windows 1820-32 Mechanical computing: Charles Babbage designs the first mechanical computers, the analytical engine (to calculate mathematical tables) and the difference engine which, had it been built, would have been the first computer 1890 Punched cards: Herman Hollerith founds the data processing industry with an electric-powered machine based on punched cards, which wins a competition to process data for the US census. Hollerith's company becomes part of IBM, and punched cards - introduced by Joseph-Marie Jacquard to automate weaving in 1805 - dominate data processing until the 1970s 1946 Valve-based computing: John Presper Eckert and John W Mauchly complete Eniac (electronic numerical integrator analyser and computer), the first fully electronic programmable computer, for the US army. It has 18,000 valves (vacuum tubes), and weighs 30 tons 1947 Transistors: The Bell Laboratory scientists William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain develop the germanium transistor. This leads to a new generation of smaller, faster, computers, as well as the portable transistor radio (1952) 1958 Microchips: Americans Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce invent the integrated circuit, which enables vast numbers of transistors and other devices to be put on a single silicon chip. The circuits take over the computer industry 1965 Supercomputing: Seymour Cray develops the CD6600, the first supercomputer, at Control Data Corporation. Cray leaves to design a series of machines that run at the highest possible speed 1971 Microprocessors: Marcian \"Ted\" Hoff designs the Intel 4004, the first microprocessor or \"computer on a chip\". Cheap microprocessors power successive booms in pocket calculators, video games consoles, personal computers and other devices 1988 Parallel computing: Danny Hillis designs the Connection Machine, a supercomputer that uses 65,536 cheap microprocessors instead of a small number of Cray-style engines 1993 Intel launches the Pentium microprocessor with 3.1m transistors on a silicon chip.

      "body": "<p>Whereas psychologists and gynaecologists are sensibly barred from allowing a professional interest to become personal, critics should sometimes cross that line. Being a TV reviewer essentially means reviewing first episodes: this is the 54th of these Monday columns, and no show has yet been mentioned twice. But television - the art form most designed to be addictive - isn't experienced like that. The real test is the series which you continue watching for interest rather than income. </p> <p>A couple of letters from readers have asked whether it's possible for a critic ever to watch television for sheer enjoyment. Well, yes. Before the TV reviewer's equivalent of the General Medical Council, I would have to confess to having formed a deep relationship with two of the subjects sent to me for analysis. </p> <p>Hearts And Bones (Wednesday, 9.30pm, BBC1) concludes its first series in a mid-week slot because European football takes the Sunday night position which it's filled so impressively. This drama - which follows a group of thirtysomethings from student idealism in Coventry to compromise jobs and relationships in south London - was conceived by the BBC in envy of ITV's mid-life middle-class ensemble piece Cold Feet, but has grown up to show its own distinct identity. </p> <p>Writer Stewart Harcourt takes a recurrent but compelling theme in literature: the hunger for another life. The plot consists of interlocking frustrations which revolve around Emma (Dervla Kirwan), who stayed with Mark (Damian Lewis) after a student pregnancy. In the opening episode, she finally married Mark - a decent but stolid teacher - but the ceremony proved to be a trigger to impermanence rather than a declaration of their durability. </p> <p>She married with make-up masking a love-bite from hen-night infidelity with her boss - an indiscretion secondary to her organising torment: her deep and nervously returned love for her husband's brother, Richard (Hugo Speer). </p> <p>In summary, this narrative can sound a little Dallas, but writing and acting reject melodrama for the genuine messy terrors of grown-up emotion. Hearts And Bones coincided with Channel 4's Anna Karenina (another extra-critical habit of mine, though milder than the two described here) and, in Emma, Kirwan and Harcourt have given us a plausible contemporary equivalent of that character and her dilemmas. Using the old reliable of infidelity to secure the audience's loyalty, Hearts And Bones also explores less developed territory. One episode focused on a parent's death from cancer. </p> <p>One example of the cleverness in the writing is that Harcourt helps to establish realism by ignoring the neatnesses of fiction. Two of the central characters are redheads; two have the same first name. Most dramas would have one of each. The use of voiceover to give the characters' inner thoughts is irritating and unnecessary because the acting is good enough to suggest the unsaid. But perhaps that device could go in the well-deserved second series just commissioned. </p> <p>My second current viewing obsession is Coupling (Friday, 9.30pm, BBC2), a comedy by Steven Moffat.

      "bodyText": "Whereas psychologists and gynaecologists are sensibly barred from allowing a professional interest to become personal, critics should sometimes cross that line. Being a TV reviewer essentially means reviewing first episodes: this is the 54th of these Monday columns, and no show has yet been mentioned twice. But television - the art form most designed to be addictive - isn't experienced like that. The real test is the series which you continue watching for interest rather than income. A couple of letters from readers have asked whether it's possible for a critic ever to watch television for sheer enjoyment. Well, yes. Before the TV reviewer's equivalent of the General Medical Council, I would have to confess to having formed a deep relationship with two of the subjects sent to me for analysis. Hearts And Bones (Wednesday, 9.30pm, BBC1) concludes its first series in a mid-week slot because European football takes the Sunday night position which it's filled so impressively. This drama - which follows a group of thirtysomethings from student idealism in Coventry to compromise jobs and relationships in south London - was conceived by the BBC in envy of ITV's mid-life middle-class ensemble piece Cold Feet, but has grown up to show its own distinct identity. Writer Stewart Harcourt takes a recurrent but compelling theme in literature: the hunger for another life. The plot consists of interlocking frustrations which revolve around Emma (Dervla Kirwan), who stayed with Mark (Damian Lewis) after a student pregnancy. In the opening episode, she finally married Mark - a decent but stolid teacher - but the ceremony proved to be a trigger to impermanence rather than a declaration of their durability. She married with make-up masking a love-bite from hen-night infidelity with her boss - an indiscretion secondary to her organising torment: her deep and nervously returned love for her husband's brother, Richard (Hugo Speer). In summary, this narrative can sound a little Dallas, but writing and acting reject melodrama for the genuine messy terrors of grown-up emotion. Hearts And Bones coincided with Channel 4's Anna Karenina (another extra-critical habit of mine, though milder than the two described here) and, in Emma, Kirwan and Harcourt have given us a plausible contemporary equivalent of that character and her dilemmas. Using the old reliable of infidelity to secure the audience's loyalty, Hearts And Bones also explores less developed territory. One episode focused on a parent's death from cancer. One example of the cleverness in the writing is that Harcourt helps to establish realism by ignoring the neatnesses of fiction. Two of the central characters are redheads; two have the same first name. Most dramas would have one of each. The use of voiceover to give the characters' inner thoughts is irritating and unnecessary because the acting is good enough to suggest the unsaid. But perhaps that device could go in the well-deserved second series just commissioned. My second current viewing obsession is Coupling (Friday, 9.30pm, BBC2), a comedy by Steven Moffat. Like Hearts And Bones, this results from scheduler's envy. British commissioners have long dreamed that some local comedy lab would clone Friends or Seinfield. Moffat's managed to cross them while creating a series which feels highly original. Whereas the American model sitcoms were intended for US mass audience transmission, Coupling, on BBC2, can be more daring in its treatment of sex. The second episode was devoted entirely to size anxiety in men and included an inspired visual gag involving an improbably long bedroom drawer. Last week's episode - in which Susan (Sarah Alexander) discovered a porn video belonging to new boyfriend Steve (Jack Davenport) - was a Men Behaving Badly set-up but climaxed in a daringly long speech (certain to paralyse most sit-com producers with size anxiety) in which Steve, at a dinner party, attempted to justify his most cherished cassette, Lesbian Porn Inferno, as an art film. Two other guests at the table - each mistakenly believing through a plausible dialogue misunderstanding that the other was gay - ended up in bed together because each arrogantly believed that homosexuals could be converted.

Camilla curtsied; they chatted; everyone seemed very pleased, especially Charles. The Duke was away, said to be engaged with his horses. True or false? Take your pick.

Charles's sister has given an interview to The Grocer, dismissing his cherished or ganic farming and lauding genetically modified food, which he hates.</p> <p>To accept Camilla's presence must have been tough for the Queen. She seems to be far more rigorous about these moral questions than most of her subjects. who may mostly conclude that it's good to see a stable relationship flourishing in a family which sometimes seems to be not very good at them. Of course we are loudly assured that even this moment of history should not be construed to suggest they will ever get married. There are difficulties with the church on that, as well as with the Queen. Even so, it would not be surprising if already the theme of marriage was being pencilled in for the next big twist in the tale, as soon as we're over this one.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sometimes The Royals seems even more ingeniously scripted than The Royles. Only 18 months ago Charles and Camilla were pictured blinking against the flashlights as they left the Ritz after their first public engagement together. That was described as a breakthrough. Now the Queen has been to a party despite knowing that Camilla would be there. This is described as a moment of history. Camilla curtsied; they chatted; everyone seemed very pleased, especially Charles. The Duke was away, said to be engaged with his horses. True or false? Take your pick. And then, just when everything was going so well, what do we get but the unexpected twist all audiences long for. Charles's sister has given an interview to The Grocer, dismissing his cherished or ganic farming and lauding genetically modified food, which he hates. To accept Camilla's presence must have been tough for the Queen. She seems to be far more rigorous about these moral questions than most of her subjects. who may mostly conclude that it's good to see a stable relationship flourishing in a family which sometimes seems to be not very good at them. Of course we are loudly assured that even this moment of history should not be construed to suggest they will ever get married. There are difficulties with the church on that, as well as with the Queen. Even so, it would not be surprising if already the theme of marriage was being pencilled in for the next big twist in the tale, as soon as we're over this one.",

Until now, the Arthritis Research Campaign, the fifth largest medical charity in the UK, has only funded work into mainstream drug-based research. But the organisation said the huge rise in the number of arthritis patients who seek relief from chronic pain through alternative medicine had prompted it to reconsider its position. The charity announced that it aims to work with complementary therapists and scientists to work out ways of testing how effective different therapies are, and to fund studies. Much complementary therapy, including dietary supplements, homeopathy, herbalism, hypnotherapy and acupuncture, remains scientifically unproven, the charity said. Despite this, one in three people had tried complementary therapies, and 66% of rheumatoid arthritis sufferers used diet supplements, hypnotherapy or homeopathy to help alleviate their pain. Launching the new initiative yesterday, the chief executive of the campaign, Fergus Logan, said: \"New medicines and treatments have traditionally been developed under a convention which says in a nutshell 'Don't use it if you can't prove it'.

      "body": "<p>There are several things you can do with 75p. You can treat yourself to a regular portion of fries at McDonald's, pick up a copy of the Telegraph on a Saturday, or a decent-sized aubergine from the supermarket. The one thing you cannot do with that sum of money, it is now patently clear, is present it to older people as a weekly rise in their state pension and expect them to vote for you in large numbers.</p> <p>Deep down a government as poll conscious and image-obsessed as this one must have always known that. But when it expressed its determination to keep the pension index-linked it was more than just a mathematical calculation. There was political arithmetic there too. Labour figured that a sizeable number of pensioners would not vote for it anyway and the rest would have little choice but to continue doing so, because the alternatives are worse.</p> <p>The trouble is the government got its sums wrong. The numbers were crunched on the understanding that older people are capable of complaining but not fighting back. It had become trapped in a paradigm of patronage which understands pensioners at worst as burdens on the public purse and at best as victims of vagaries ranging from bad weather to street crime.</p> <p>It is not a mindset particular to Labour. As the bunting unfolds and the guest list is drawn up for the Queen Mother's 100th birthday party, it is a view that will underpin a national obsession. Strip away the patriotic paraphernalia and you are left with a popular figurehead of an unpopular family who derives her support from the fact that she is old and therefore people think she doesn't really matter. The nation will coo at her frailty and marvel at the very resilience of her years but they do not expect her to say or do anything but wave and smile. We may be her subjects; but she is our object.</p> <p>But to regard pensioners as recipients of, rather than agents within, the political process is at worst patronising and at best naive. \"The only time you see old people in the papers is when they've got a black eye and they've just been mugged,\" says 82-year-old Peggy Jones. \"But we're not after sympathy. We're after a decent income, proper healthcare, and a good transport system. We want what everybody else wants.\"</p> <p>Peggy, who lives in Brighton, belongs to a pensioners' group which organises meetings and lobbies everyone from MPs and councillors to bus companies and health boards about pensioner's demands. Attendance at their monthly meetings occasionally hits 100, but is more often between 30 and 40 a time. \"It's not huge numbers,\" says Isla Robertson, 67. \"But it's a far better turnout that you get at most Labour party meetings.\" Isla and Peggy are part of a growing movement that any political party ignores at its peril. In America they have earned the name the Grey Panthers; throughout Europe they are labelled as the advocates of grey power. But demographically, politically and economically, it is a global force that has come of age.</p> <p>Pensioners make up one quarter of the nation's electorate; within a few decades it will be more like a third. Moreover, they are more likely to vote than almost any other group. They may not all be radical; but many, if not most, are angry and are feeling bitterly disappointed by this government. This is the generation who helped build the welfare state and are now being told they are a burden upon it. It will soon include many who were politicised during the 60s. Not all of their criticisms of this government are necessarily fair. But politics isn't fair. Labour has offered pensioners what it thinks they need rather than what pensioners have said they want. Now they are being punished.</p> <p>At the last pensioners' parliament in Blackpool, attended by more than 2,000 delegates and organised by the lobby group the National Pensioner's Convention, dissidents argued for direct action, sit-ins and for their vote conditional on Labour returning the link between pensions and average male earnings. They remain a minority but their numbers, like their frustration, is growing. And they are not going to shut up for the price of a cup of tea and a pat on the head.</p> <p>Labour found this out the hard way during last month's local elections. Three quarters of the Labour councillors who lost their seats in last month's local elections said pensioners, angry at the miserly increase, had largely contributed to their defeat. Until then the government responded to pensioners by doing what it always does when criticised by those who expect more. It presents a list of all it has done, and expects scales to fall from the eyes of the detractors and gratitude to come rolling in.</p> <p>\"Every time I write to my local MP,\" says Robertson, \"they tell me all the things I should be thankful for - the heating allowance, the free eye tests, waiving the TV licence fee and all of that.

      "bodyText": "There are several things you can do with 75p. You can treat yourself to a regular portion of fries at McDonald's, pick up a copy of the Telegraph on a Saturday, or a decent-sized aubergine from the supermarket. The one thing you cannot do with that sum of money, it is now patently clear, is present it to older people as a weekly rise in their state pension and expect them to vote for you in large numbers. Deep down a government as poll conscious and image-obsessed as this one must have always known that. But when it expressed its determination to keep the pension index-linked it was more than just a mathematical calculation. There was political arithmetic there too. Labour figured that a sizeable number of pensioners would not vote for it anyway and the rest would have little choice but to continue doing so, because the alternatives are worse. The trouble is the government got its sums wrong. The numbers were crunched on the understanding that older people are capable of complaining but not fighting back. It had become trapped in a paradigm of patronage which understands pensioners at worst as burdens on the public purse and at best as victims of vagaries ranging from bad weather to street crime. It is not a mindset particular to Labour. As the bunting unfolds and the guest list is drawn up for the Queen Mother's 100th birthday party, it is a view that will underpin a national obsession. Strip away the patriotic paraphernalia and you are left with a popular figurehead of an unpopular family who derives her support from the fact that she is old and therefore people think she doesn't really matter. The nation will coo at her frailty and marvel at the very resilience of her years but they do not expect her to say or do anything but wave and smile. We may be her subjects; but she is our object. But to regard pensioners as recipients of, rather than agents within, the political process is at worst patronising and at best naive. \"The only time you see old people in the papers is when they've got a black eye and they've just been mugged,\" says 82-year-old Peggy Jones. \"But we're not after sympathy. We're after a decent income, proper healthcare, and a good transport system. We want what everybody else wants.\" Peggy, who lives in Brighton, belongs to a pensioners' group which organises meetings and lobbies everyone from MPs and councillors to bus companies and health boards about pensioner's demands. Attendance at their monthly meetings occasionally hits 100, but is more often between 30 and 40 a time. \"It's not huge numbers,\" says Isla Robertson, 67. \"But it's a far better turnout that you get at most Labour party meetings.\" Isla and Peggy are part of a growing movement that any political party ignores at its peril. In America they have earned the name the Grey Panthers; throughout Europe they are labelled as the advocates of grey power. But demographically, politically and economically, it is a global force that has come of age. Pensioners make up one quarter of the nation's electorate; within a few decades it will be more like a third. Moreover, they are more likely to vote than almost any other group. They may not all be radical; but many, if not most, are angry and are feeling bitterly disappointed by this government. This is the generation who helped build the welfare state and are now being told they are a burden upon it. It will soon include many who were politicised during the 60s. Not all of their criticisms of this government are necessarily fair. But politics isn't fair. Labour has offered pensioners what it thinks they need rather than what pensioners have said they want. Now they are being punished. At the last pensioners' parliament in Blackpool, attended by more than 2,000 delegates and organised by the lobby group the National Pensioner's Convention, dissidents argued for direct action, sit-ins and for their vote conditional on Labour returning the link between pensions and average male earnings. They remain a minority but their numbers, like their frustration, is growing. And they are not going to shut up for the price of a cup of tea and a pat on the head. Labour found this out the hard way during last month's local elections. Three quarters of the Labour councillors who lost their seats in last month's local elections said pensioners, angry at the miserly increase, had largely contributed to their defeat. Until then the government responded to pensioners by doing what it always does when criticised by those who expect more. It presents a list of all it has done, and expects scales to fall from the eyes of the detractors and gratitude to come rolling in. \"Every time I write to my local MP,\" says Robertson, \"they tell me all the things I should be thankful for - the heating allowance, the free eye tests, waiving the TV licence fee and all of that. But I don't want concessions. I don't want charity. I want a decent income so I can be independent.\" Now a government which has started its life rebranding both Britain and itself as young and trendy, has been forced to redirect its message. Within 10 days of the local elections the social security secretary, Alistair Darling, was calling for more positive images of older people in the media. The chancellor now plans to up the pension next month by between \u00a32 and \u00a33, regardless of inflation.

      "bodyText": "President Robert Mugabe's government stepped up its attack on Zimbabwe's white minority yesterday by launching an assault on senior judges of British descent. In a series of comments in the state-run media, the government accused judges sitting in the supreme and high courts of being ill-qualified to pass judgment in politically sensitive cases, on the grounds that legally, they were not citizens of Zimbabwe. Several high court judges, black and white, are planning to make a public protest today against the claims. There are fears that the accusations will be followed by a direct attempt to have white judges removed from the bench. The escalation of antagonism against the white minority signals an attempt to weaken the position of Zimbabwe's judiciary, widely seen as one of the last bastions of independence in the country. The courts have made several rulings against the Mugabe government. Two of the five supreme court judges are white, including the chief justice, Anthony Gubbay. Four of the 20 high court judges are also white. The accusations against the white judges were made by Jonathan Moyo, a government spokesman and the architect of the campaign by Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party in the general election on June 24 and 25. \"No sane Zimbabwean should expect the judiciary to be headed by a foreigner - especially a British - 20 years af ter our independence, just like it would be insane to have a foreign or British president or speaker of parliament,\" he said in the state-owned Sunday Mail newspaper. Mr Moyo claimed that Mr Gubbay had not renounced his claim to British citizenship properly, and therefore was not a Zimbabwean citizen. He also reiterated the government's new policy, introduced two weeks ago, that all Zimbabweans of British descent should have renounced their claims to British citizenship, under both Zimbabwean and British law, by December 1985. Those who did not have been stripped of their Zimbabwean citizenship. \"Among those who allegedly did not comply is chief justice Gubbay,\" Mr Moyo said. \"Justice Gubbay and his affected colleagues face serious questions about the legal and political legitimacy of their positions as judges.\" Similar accusations were levelled in radio and television news bulletins from the state-owned Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC). The allegations were also made in the weekly Mirror newspaper, whose publisher and editor is a member of Zanu-PF. The citizenship office has stated that an estimated 86,000 people are no longer Zimbabwean citizens - this means that they are no longer eligible to vote. The government has also issued a new policy stating that permanent residents are not eligible to vote, despite clauses in the constitution which say clearly that they do have that right. A high court judge, Michael Gillespy, yesterday refuted the government's allegations that he was not a Zimbabwean citizen. \"I am a citizen of Zimbabwe and I have never had any other citizenship,\" he said, adding that he was \"contemplating instructing attorneys to take legal action against those making these statements\". Britain's shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, who made a 36-hour visit to Zimbabwe at the weekend, called on the Commonwealth to increase the number of its observers at the forthcoming elections from the current 44 to 300 to 500. \"It is essential that observers should stay for at least two or three weeks after the election, to reduce the chance of violent retribution,\" he added. Mr Maude was responding to widespread reports that government officials are threatening to beat and even kill rural Zimbabweans if they vote for the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.

Its trophy assets are Meadowhall and Broadgate, while Liberty owns 75% of Capital Shopping Centres, which in turn owns Lakeside and MetroCentre.</p> <p>The deal values Liberty at \u00a31.73bn and involves British Land paying 550p per share compared with a market price of 466p.

      "bodyText": "John Ritblat, chairman of British Land, is expected to hold talks with Liberty International - in which he has just taken a 29.9% stake - about creating Britain's largest commercial property business. Such a deal would bring together Lakeside in Essex and MetroCentre in Gateshead with Sheffield's Meadowhall centre and the Broadgate office development in London. British Land is expected to confirm this morning that it has paid \u00a3514m for the stake. Its trophy assets are Meadowhall and Broadgate, while Liberty owns 75% of Capital Shopping Centres, which in turn owns Lakeside and MetroCentre. The deal values Liberty at \u00a31.73bn and involves British Land paying 550p per share compared with a market price of 466p. About 55% will be paid in cash, with the balance met by the issue of British Land shares at 450p each. The stake was sold by Standard Bank of South Africa after a five-month auction handled by Morgan Stanley. British Land is expected to describe the investment as \"strategic\" and sources close to the company say it does not intend to make a full bid at present. However, Mr Ritblat is thought to have suggested a merger to Donald Gordon, Liberty's 69-year-old South African chairman, who built up the company from scratch. It is not known how Mr Gordon reacted when Mr Ritblat telephoned him over the weekend to break the news of the shares purchase. Liberty's managing director, David Fischel, said last night: \"We're taking a mature approach to this and do not see it as hostile. We've known for some time that Standard Bank has been looking to sell its stake and that British Land was one of the parties it was talking to. \"Donald Gordon and John Ritblat have known each other for many years. It's good the sale is finally out of the way. British Land has made a shrewd investment.\" Mr Ritblat and Mr Gordon have both talked openly about their belief that the property sector needs to be consolidated and shaken from its current state of lethargy. But price could be a sticking point if British Land does de cide to mount a full bid. Liberty's published net asset value is about 700p per share and - although British Land paid a healthy premium to the current share price to buy Standard Bank's stake - it would almost certainly have to increase it again to persuade Mr Gordon to deal. Analysts say that British Land does not have the re sources to bid on its own and would need to find a partner. George Soros, the US investor, has done several deals with Ritblat and is seen as one possible candidate. Under the takeover panel's rules, British Land cannot increase its stake beyond the level of 29.9% it has just bought without having to mount a full bid. British Land's move is likely to increase interest among City investors in the property sector, which until recently had been out of favour. That view started to change last week when MEPC, the third largest company in the sector, was bought by Hermes, the pension fund manager, and General Electric of the US for \u00a31.9bn.",

      "bodyText": "Cadbury Schweppes is considering a joint \u00a310bn bid with France's Danone for US-based Nabisco, the Ritz crackers and Oreo cookies group, according to weekend reports. Cadbury is expected to shoulder up to \u00a34bn of the cost - making it the largest offer in the British company's history - while Danone would fund the other 60%. Last month Cadbury, which has been looking for a big confectionery purchase, said it had expressed an \"exploratory interest\" in parts of Nabisco and Danone said it was holding preliminary talks with the American food company. At the time the company declined to comment on speculation it might join Danone in carving up Nabisco and had nothing more to say on the subject yesterday. \"You would expect a company such as Cadbury Schweppes to explore the options available,\" a spokeswoman said. The main attraction for Cadbury is said to be Nabisco's US sugar confectionery business, while analysts say it makes strategic sense for the French group to extend its reach into the United States. The British company is variously reported as having be tween \u00a33bn and \u00a35bn available for acquisitions. A total of 13 interested parties have already signed confidentiality agreements with Nabisco and a Cadbury-Danone joint bid would have to compete with companies such as RJ Reynolds Tobacco, current favourite Philip Morris, as well as American financier Carl Icahn. Danone is the world's leading biscuit producer thanks to its domination in Europe and Asia, but until now its US interests have been mainly in mineral waters and dairy products. Acquiring Nabisco, including the company's stake in United Biscuits, would help the French company realise its goal to become the world's biggest biscuit maker. Nabisco's sweets operations would be a catch for Cadbury, which has had its room for expansion in America curtailed by a licensing deal with its rival Hershey, which has exclusive rights to sell Cadbury chocolate products in perpetuity. Cadbury's previous biggest deal was the \u00a31.5bn purchase of Dr Pepper/Seven Up, which it completed in 1995. If the joint bid with Danone goes ahead, it will be the first time a French and a British company have joined forces to mount such a big offer.",

      "bodyText": "The United Nations mission in Kosovo was plunged into new difficulties yesterday as Serb leaders withdrew from the province's interim administrative body and demanded effective self-rule in their own strongholds, in protest at killings of Serb civilians by Kosovan Albanian extremists. As the security council prepares to meet next week to review the first 12 months of the mission in Kosovo, Serb leaders announced that they would be sending a delegation to New York to demand amendments to resolution 1244 - the mandate for the UN effort - to protect Serb rights in Kosovo and allow the establishment \"of functional self-rule\" in areas occupied by Serbs. In addition, moderate Serb leaders say that they have already asked European officials in the region to send anti-terrorism experts to back up the Kosovo protection force and the UN's international police force. The statement by the Serb national council, meeting at the ancient monastery of Gracanica, comes amid disillusionment among many officials serving with the UN mission over the resurgence of ethnic violence and organised crime in Kosovo, and the apparent unwillingness of senior officials to take on the ethnic Albanian leaders suspected of involvement in both. The Serbs' decision is doubly embarrassing for the UN mission, which is preparing to mark the first anniversary of its mandate this weekend and has been making strenuous efforts to persuade Serbs to share its vision of a multi-ethnic democratic society. But the Serb community is angry about an eruption of violence in the last week that has left eight of their members dead in four incidents. The most recent took place early last Friday, when a car hit an anti-tank mine which had been planted overnight on a British-controlled road a few miles from Pristina. Two men died, and a woman and two children were injured. The decision to withdraw from the Albanian dominated administrative council is also a blow for Bernard Kouchner, the head of the UN mission, who had recently managed to persuade moderate Serbs, backed by the Serbian Orthodox church, to attend the council as observers prior to full involvement. It comes amid a campaign for voter registration for the region's first local elections, scheduled for the autumn. While more than 250,000 ethnic Albanians have been persuaded to register, only a few thousand of the province's remaining 95,000 Serbs - from a community originally numbering 250,000 - have registered to vote. Following the meeting yesterday, Father Sava, a moderate Serb leader who has backed Serb involvement in Kosovo's nascent democratic process, indicated that many Serb leaders wanted to end cooperation with the UN, rather than suspending their involvement until the security council meets. \"The international community has got to decide whether Kosovo is going to be a lawless place or move towards being a democratic society,\" he said. \"At the moment, the international community is not really prepared to take the lead against Albanian terrorism or confront the problem of organised crime.\" He added: \"We are aware of the efforts that are being made to protect Serb people, particularly in the British sector which seems determined to work in an even-handed way. But in the last two months of our cooperation with the UN administration we have seen a resurgence of organised crime all over Kosovo.\" The rise in the violence and intimidation against the remaining Serb community comes despite intense efforts to make Serbs feel secure.

It is scheduled to begin operation by next autumn. It would initially run for 10 years, and could extended for five-year periods, senior American officials said. The initiative was prompted by US alarm at the dilapidated state of Russia's system of satellites and radar facilities monitoring ballistic missile launches. A pilot programme involving US and Russian military personnel was conducted in Colorado at the end of last year. \"The purpose of this whole effort is to provide a near real-time exchange of the detected information about the launch of ballistic missiles and space-launch vehicles that are detected by the warning systems of the two sides,\" said a senior US official yesterday at the end of Mr Clinton's two-day summit with President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. \"It will be the first time that American and Russian military personnel will be permanently involved in a joint military operation over an extended period.\" The US and Russian leaders also announced agreement on a deal costing almost $6bn which would dispose of 68 tonnes - 34 tonnes each - of weapons-grade plutonium over the next 20 years. Mr Clinton said that the plutonium being put into storage or civilian nuclear energy projects was enough to build thousands of warheads. \"It will never now fall into the wrong hands,\" he declared. The disposal of the US plutonium would cost $4bn, the Russian $1.75bn. US officials said other unnamed countries would be expected to contribute to the cost. The agreement stipulates the \"safe, transparent and irreversible\" disposal of the plutonium. Neither side would be able to use the plutonium for military purposes. Reflecting US unease at the Russian supply of nuclear materials and technology to Iran, where Moscow is building a power plant at Bushehr, Mr Clinton said he had insisted on \"strict export controls\". Mr Putin has just signed a decree making it easier for Moscow to strike commercial deals for exports of civilian nuclear technology, a move that has alarmed western nuclear proliferation experts. American officials said that the Moscow centre, which entailed 16 US and 17 Russian military officers working shifts 24 hours a day and seven days a week, would use space-based satellites, infrared systems, and early warning radar. But the Americans also hope that the establishment of the centre will reduce stiff Russian opposition to US plans for a national missile defence system, the sore point of the weekend summit, by helping to persuade them that it is no threat to strategic stability and the Russian nuclear deterrent. \"The purpose is to avoid the possibility of false warning of attack ...

Ten European airlines, including British Airways, Lufthansa and the Scandinavian airline SAS have linked wings to launch an online ticket service later this year that will enable customers to make what may be unflattering price comparisons. </p> <p>For the first time, consumers will be able to plan complex itineraries online. The service, run as an independent agency, will also help with extras such as car hire. </p> <p>The aim is to bump up the amount of business travel booked online. The vast majority of flights sold online in this country are to independent travellers, with business fliers making up only a tiny percentage. Compare this to the US, where 30% of business flights are booked online, and it's obvious why the airlines want to get this service off the ground. After all, travel is already the biggest online money spinner in Europe, amounting to $9m worth of business in 1999, with experts forecasting a leap to $27m by 2003. </p> <p>But who will be making the money? Customers could be tempted to deal directly with the airlines, snatching business away from high street agencies. The airlines have well-established brand names - if we can trust them with our lives, why not let them pick our hotels? </p> <p>They also have the money to invest. BA alone is planning to spend \u00a3100m on online ventures over the next two years, and unlike traditional agencies, it isn't saddled with a costly high street operation. </p> <p>In the short term it seems that the customer can't lose, but what of the long term? The danger is that the travel agencies, faced with such stiff competition, will join forces themselves, through mergers and takeovers, leaving travellers with even less choice.</p>",

Ten European airlines, including British Airways, Lufthansa and the Scandinavian airline SAS have linked wings to launch an online ticket service later this year that will enable customers to make what may be unflattering price comparisons. For the first time, consumers will be able to plan complex itineraries online. The service, run as an independent agency, will also help with extras such as car hire. The aim is to bump up the amount of business travel booked online. The vast majority of flights sold online in this country are to independent travellers, with business fliers making up only a tiny percentage. Compare this to the US, where 30% of business flights are booked online, and it's obvious why the airlines want to get this service off the ground. After all, travel is already the biggest online money spinner in Europe, amounting to $9m worth of business in 1999, with experts forecasting a leap to $27m by 2003. But who will be making the money? Customers could be tempted to deal directly with the airlines, snatching business away from high street agencies. The airlines have well-established brand names - if we can trust them with our lives, why not let them pick our hotels? They also have the money to invest. BA alone is planning to spend \u00a3100m on online ventures over the next two years, and unlike traditional agencies, it isn't saddled with a costly high street operation. In the short term it seems that the customer can't lose, but what of the long term? The danger is that the travel agencies, faced with such stiff competition, will join forces themselves, through mergers and takeovers, leaving travellers with even less choice.",

If you mention to a workmate that you think you've got the \"Viagra\", which makes a new hard drive out of an old floppy, or the \"Mike Tyson\", which quits after two bytes, and it's likely she'll get the joke. With around 60,000 known computer viruses now circulating in cyberspace, few office workers are unaware of the risks from these silent saboteurs. But as their numbers and sophistication increases, recognising the early symptoms is becoming more and more difficult. </p> <p>The latest nasty infection has been dubbed the \"killer r\u00e9sum\u00e9\" because it disguises itself as a seemingly innocent job application. Opening the attachment entitled \"R\u00e9sum\u00e9 - Janet Simons\" activates the virus, sending out emails to everyone in your address book while deleting important system files and then disabling your computer altogether. </p> <p>Although the \"I love you\" virus - which cost businesses an estimated \u00a33bn when it hit hundreds of thousands of computers last month - is by far the most destructive to date, bugs have played serious havoc since \"Michelangelo\" wiped countless PC hard disks on March 6 1991, the painter's birthday. Four years later, \"Word.Concept\" did the rounds, copying itself to the template of Microsoft Word documents. Within 12 months it was the most prevalent computer virus in the world. Next to cause global chaos was \"Wazzu\" in 1996, but it was probably \"Melissa\" three years later, which disguised a list of pornographic sites as a text file, that brought the computer virus to wide public awareness. Opening the file emailed the virus to 50 or more people; before long it had hit an estimated 1 million computers. </p> <p>There is something about computer saboteurs that is almost romantic, the image of a lone geek bringing global companies to their knees. But those who have experienced the effects of viruses know that there is little that is innocent about them. And according to Graham Cluley, spokesman for anti-virus company Sophos, bugs are getting more advanced and sinister by the day. \"At the moment, the majority are written by youngsters who think it's cool to wipe as much as possible in as short a space of time as possible. The real problem occurs with the recent increase in the more sinister, unrecognisable viruses that have more subtle corruptions. They might, for example, multiply a random number on your spreadsheet every now and then by 0.05, or wipe random paragraphs from text files over several months.\" These sophisticated viruses, he says, are considerably more dangerous. \"First, they're less easy for anti-virus software to spot, and second, by the time you've noticed the effects, all your back-ups will probably be corrupted too.\" </p> <p>Since office support staff are often the first to open emails in their own or their bosses' queues, it is vital that they are tuned in to the risks from viruses. But vigilance in itself can be dangerous - some cunning hackers have begun to disguise viruses as public service circulars warning of other virus threats. \"We've also noticed a rise in vicious rumours about viruses,\" says George Coleman, spokesperson for computer security company Content Technologies. \"Someone sends out the warning by email and asks the receiver to send it on to everyone they know. Because the system can't cope with the sudden overload of email sending, everything breaks down. Secretarial staff, who like to be on the ball in terms of caution about computer problems, are particularly vulnerable to this one.\" </p> <p>And if you think your digital organiser or internet WAP phone is safe from these millennial bugs, think again. Mobile phone viruses could copy conversations and forward them to others, delete money from \"electronic wallets\" or rack up huge telephone bills. \"The easier communication becomes, the more damage can be done by viruses,\" points out a spokesperson at IBM. </p> <p>So what prompts someone to create a destructive email? According to Aled Miles, managing director of anti-virus company Symantec, many smaller viruses are designed by disgruntled employees with the purpose of eradicating one particular business. But the biggest fashion, he admits, is mass destruction, \"simply because it's possible\". Miles has found that these cyber-criminals are usually male, under 21, with one of three psychological profiles: \"The self-publicist; the person who is into cyber-graffiti - which is intended to be relatively harmless; and the wannabe cyber-terrorist.\" </p> <p>The good news, according to Coleman, is that many virus authors aren't set on a trail of destruction. Instead, they're simply playing a game. \"They'll write the virus and send it to companies like ours - rather than out into the wilds of cyberspace - to fix. It's almost like a challenge: 'Here's my latest. See if you can cure it.' \" </p> <p>In addition, he points out, some internet service providers are considering taking on viruses themselves. \"Rather than having the [anti-virus] software in-house, and having to constantly update, you would pay a subscription for them to do it for you.\" The advantage of this is that no email would come anywhere near your company until it had been checked. The battle against viruses, he says, is akin to a war, and just as the number of hackers is growing, so is the opposition. Many of the nerdy but sophisticated hackers of yesteryear have turned into cybersleuths, offering freelance services to police forces in Europe and America. The police's hands can be tied, however. It is almost impossible to catch cyber-criminals and many countries simply do not have adequate laws to deal with computer-related crimes. \"In the UK, under the Computer Misuse Act, the longest sentence is just a few years,\" says Graeme Moffett, a solicitor specialising in technology law with Shepherd &amp; Wedderburn. \"If you're hellbent on causing global mayhem, that's not really going to put you off.\" </p> <p>Rather than despairing about the risks, Jack Clark, European product manager of anti-virus company, Network Associates, believes there is an urgent need for both employers and employees to get clued up on the threat from viruses. \"I am amazed at the number of staff who automatically open every attachment they're given,\" he says. If you're not expecting an attachment, he advises, always phone or email the sender to check they meant to send it. \"Make back-ups of everything and have as few email addresses in your address book as possible. Most importantly, make sure you continually update your anti-virus software.\" The first rule of combat, after all, is to be properly armed against the enemy.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Ever get the feeling that you're not sure what your responsibilities really are? Or that you don't get enough recognition for them either verbally or financially? Or that your job title doesn't reflect them? It's time to take advantage of your appraisal. Faced with the prospect of a lengthy and often ineffectual liaison with the boss to \"review performance\", secretarial staff can be as relieved as managers when the diary proves just too inflexible and a meeting has to be cancelled at the last minute. But, warn human resources experts, staff neglect their appraisal at their peril. </p> <p>Contrary to popular opinion, appraisals are not simply about assessing your past performance to allow your boss to see if you deserve a pay rise. \"The 90s witnessed a clear trend away from linking appraisals to salaries,\" says Debra Allcock, head of campaigning at the Industrial Society. A recent study found that of the 77% of British companies that have a formal appraisal system in place, almost half claim there is no association with wages. \"Today's appraisals have less focus on past assessment and more on the future of the staff member in terms of development needs.\" </p> <p>The problem, says Allcock, lies in the fact that all too many employees don't really understand the point of appraisals. And more worrying still, nor do many of the managers themselves. The Institute of Personnel and Development (IPD) have found that a third of employees say their bosses treat appraisals as \"a bureaucratic chore\". One in eight managers said they would rather visit the dentist than carry out an appraisal. </p> <p>So what can secretaries do to help themselves? \"First, request a preliminary discussion about what the method and potential results will be,\" advises Max A Eggert, management psychologist and author of Managing Your Appraisal. \"Find out in detail what's going to be asked, what you need to bring along, and if you can make requests. It will make any complacent managers ensure they get it right and that you get the fairest appraisal.\" You may even want to enquire about appraisal systems at interview stage, suggests Allcock - \"and don't assume that the bigger the company, the better the system\". Sometimes, indeed, large multi-national firms have the worst systems in place because the person carrying out the appraisal may have very little to do with you on a daily basis. </p> <p>Helen Smith, a PA at British Telecom, recommends requesting \"mini-appraisals\" with your boss, a series of regular supervisions to keep an eye on workloads and progress. \"They guarantee that my boss knows my every improvement,\" she says, \"and consequently, when there has been a promotion opportunity, he's thought of me.\" But you should beware of subjectivity, particularly during appraisals that are performance based. Almost a third of the IPD's survey respondents thought appraisal ratings had more to do with how much your boss likes you than how well you do the job. \"Demand examples of all complaints and negative feedback,\" she suggests. \"Ask for reasons if you come fairly low on the appraisal scale system. And make sure you get your side of the story written down if you feel there have been misunderstandings.\" </p> <p>It's never a bad idea to keep hold of any notes people write applauding your work - and if someone simply tells you that you've done a great job, write it down yourself. Keep all the notes in a file and bring them along to the meeting. </p> <p>The Body Shop and Sony are two of an increasing number of companies that have gone one step further. Concerned by the natural bias that can occur when appraisals are completed by a single person, they have introduced the 360-degree appraisal, popular in American workplaces. \"Your team members, your clients and your subordinates may all be asked to contribute - often anonymously,\" explains Clive Fletcher, author of Appraisal: Routes to Improved Performance. \"It's only been introduced at secretarial level during the past few years but it's quickly catching on. Appraisal needn't be a dirty word.\" </p> <p><strong> Appraisal checklist </strong><br> </p> <p>\u0095 Were you given enough time to prepare for your appraisal? </p> <p> \u0095 Was your appraisal conducted in a friendly but business-like manner? </p> <p> \u0095 Was your performance discussed with examples to illustrate the points that your interviewer was making? </p> <p> \u0095 Did you review and agree your future training requirements and career aspirations? </p> <p> \u0095 Was there sufficient time set aside for your appraisal? </p> <p> \u0095 Were the goals and standards of your job made clear to you? </p> <p> \u0095 Were your views and explanations welcome?</p>",

A recent study found that of the 77% of British companies that have a formal appraisal system in place, almost half claim there is no association with wages. \"Today's appraisals have less focus on past assessment and more on the future of the staff member in terms of development needs.\" The problem, says Allcock, lies in the fact that all too many employees don't really understand the point of appraisals. And more worrying still, nor do many of the managers themselves. The Institute of Personnel and Development (IPD) have found that a third of employees say their bosses treat appraisals as \"a bureaucratic chore\". One in eight managers said they would rather visit the dentist than carry out an appraisal. So what can secretaries do to help themselves? \"First, request a preliminary discussion about what the method and potential results will be,\" advises Max A Eggert, management psychologist and author of Managing Your Appraisal. \"Find out in detail what's going to be asked, what you need to bring along, and if you can make requests. It will make any complacent managers ensure they get it right and that you get the fairest appraisal.\" You may even want to enquire about appraisal systems at interview stage, suggests Allcock - \"and don't assume that the bigger the company, the better the system\". Sometimes, indeed, large multi-national firms have the worst systems in place because the person carrying out the appraisal may have very little to do with you on a daily basis. Helen Smith, a PA at British Telecom, recommends requesting \"mini-appraisals\" with your boss, a series of regular supervisions to keep an eye on workloads and progress. \"They guarantee that my boss knows my every improvement,\" she says, \"and consequently, when there has been a promotion opportunity, he's thought of me.\" But you should beware of subjectivity, particularly during appraisals that are performance based. Almost a third of the IPD's survey respondents thought appraisal ratings had more to do with how much your boss likes you than how well you do the job. \"Demand examples of all complaints and negative feedback,\" she suggests. \"Ask for reasons if you come fairly low on the appraisal scale system. And make sure you get your side of the story written down if you feel there have been misunderstandings.\" It's never a bad idea to keep hold of any notes people write applauding your work - and if someone simply tells you that you've done a great job, write it down yourself. Keep all the notes in a file and bring them along to the meeting. The Body Shop and Sony are two of an increasing number of companies that have gone one step further. Concerned by the natural bias that can occur when appraisals are completed by a single person, they have introduced the 360-degree appraisal, popular in American workplaces. \"Your team members, your clients and your subordinates may all be asked to contribute - often anonymously,\" explains Clive Fletcher, author of Appraisal: Routes to Improved Performance. \"It's only been introduced at secretarial level during the past few years but it's quickly catching on. Appraisal needn't be a dirty word.\" Appraisal checklist \u0095 Were you given enough time to prepare for your appraisal? \u0095 Was your appraisal conducted in a friendly but business-like manner? \u0095 Was your performance discussed with examples to illustrate the points that your interviewer was making? \u0095 Did you review and agree your future training requirements and career aspirations? \u0095 Was there sufficient time set aside for your appraisal? \u0095 Were the goals and standards of your job made clear to you? \u0095 Were your views and explanations welcome?",

But you're not likely to be reading or hearing very much about it in the weeks and months to come. Bringing the two Libyans accused of the Lockerbie bombing before a court of law was a major achievement. But that's about as far as the compliments go.</p> <p>Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah have denied murder, conspiracy to murder, and destroying an aircraft. They are being tried under Scots law by three judges. A fourth judge sits with them, ready to step in if one of the others dies before the verdict. The judges sit without a jury in a specially built court near Utrecht in the Netherlands.</p> <p>Drive off the motorway and you know you have reached Camp Zeist when you see pairs of Scottish police officers in flak jackets and baseball caps, cradling automatic weapons. The police are friendly enough when you speak to them, but it's hard to forget that they could kill you at any moment. Your car may be checked by Dutch sniffer dogs (from a company called K9); one day I saw a burly security guard vacuuming the courtroom carpet after his dog had become a trifle overenthusiastic.</p> <p>Huge sums of money have been spent by the Scottish Court Service on providing facilities for the media, but no attempt has been made to give reporters what they actually need to cover the trial. As a result, journalists have all but melted away. A vast structure has been erected so that 16 television reporters can simultaneously broadcast live from sheltered positions overlooking the court. But television companies aren't allowed to bring editing equipment to the site: reporters have to drive, walk or cycle to a car park one kilometre away. Or they can wait for the bus.</p> <p>Print journalists have been given a huge media centre with places for 240 reporters to watch the trial on a closed circuit television link. But the Crown Office, which is responsible for Scottish prosecutions, won't provide even the most basic information - such as who the witnesses are and how they spell their names. The lists of witnesses and items of evidence are attached to the published indictment and, arguably, are therefore public documents. But there seems little point in challenging the Crown's decision to withhold them.</p> <p>Prosecution lawyers are thought to be afraid that reporters might approach witnesses if they knew who they were. It's thought unlikely that the court would order witnesses' names to be released against the Crown's wishes: attempts to have the trial televised were doomed to failure once the prosecution argued that broadcasts might deter witnesses from giving evidence. Prosecution witnesses now tend to enter the court complex through a side entrance, well away from the only position where cameras are allowed.</p> <p>Witnesses are normally kept on the other side of the floor-to-ceiling glass screen that separates press and public from the courtroom itself. In any other court case, reporters normally find out what's going on by having a quiet word with the lawyers during adjournments. But that's impossible when the lawyers spend all day \"airside\" - visible through the glass partition but totally inaccessible to reporters. Both prosecution and defence lawyers have offices in the court building, so you can't even see them at lunchtime.</p> <p>No doubt, this suits the prosecution very well. The Lord Advocate, Colin Boyd, seems pleasant enough when you ambush him in the car park, but you can tell he'd much rather not be answering difficult questions. Why, for example, does an official from the United States Justice Department sit next to prosecution lawyers in court? What does he tell the American victims' families at briefings every evening? Why did Boyd run out of witnesses on several occasions during the early days of the trial, forcing unnecessary adjournments?</p> <p>Boyd could hardly have been surprised that there was little by way of defence cross-examination to prolong the witnesses' evidence: the two accused don't deny that a plane exploded over Lockerbie, killing 270 people. Even the judges got fed up with hearing an endless succession of police officers explain which piece of wreckage was found in which particular field; most reporters had lost patience some days earlier. Why couldn't the prosecutor have agreed the uncontroversial evidence with defence lawyers in advance? Under Scots law, if facts are agreed or evidence is undisputed, oral evidence need not be called at the trial.</p> <p>Prosecution sources subsequently pointed out that it takes two to make a deal. But this perfectly reasonable (if somewhat unconvincing) response was not available from the Lord Advocate's press officer at the time; the Crown Office in Edinburgh is about as uncommunicative today as its nearest English equivalent, the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, was some 15 years ago.</p> <p>All this would have mattered less if the media had more to go on than the outline of the prosecution's case contained in the formal indictment. In English trials, the prosecution summarises the case against the defendant in an opening speech, making it easier to understand the significance of the evidence when it comes.</p> <p>There are no opening speeches in Scottish criminal trials, presumably to avoid the risk that juries will decide cases on the strength of what's alleged rather than what can be proved. But what harm would an opening speech have done in a case where there is no jury?</p> <p>Without a solid framework, journalists must struggle to make sense of prosecution witnesses and defence cross-examination. When the evidence is so confusing, disjointed or repetitious, it's little wonder that news organisations find it hard to justify the cost of keeping reporters and television crews at the Scottish court in the Netherlands.</p> <p>Attempts to fill the information gap were made by a group of academics from Glasgow university. Unfortunately one of their number was a retired diplomat, Andrew Fulton, who'd spent time in Saigon and East Berlin; he was not to be seen again after the Guardian Diary guessed he must be from MI6. In this climate of conspiracy, it's hardly surprising that the Sunday Herald ran a story in Scotland last month headlined \"Lockerbie report leaves trial in chaos\". The specific story - that the prosecution had been forced to seek an adjournment because one of its star witnesses had cast doubt on where the bomb had been positioned on Pan-Am 103 - was roundly and convincingly denied by the Lord Advocate.</p> <p>But two things were true. A different prosecution witness, from the government's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, admitted under questioning by the defence that he had wrongly calculated the likely position of the bomb on board the aircraft, which could be crucial in establishing whether it was in the suitcase allegedly put on the plane in Malta by the two accused. And the prosecution had indeed been forced to seek an adjournment so it could examine new scientific evidence.</p> <p>That came about because of precognition, one of the mysteries of Scots law. Lawyers from the Procurator Fiscal's office - the nearest Scottish equivalent to the Crown Prosecution Service in England - visit defence witnesses before they give evidence and ask them what they plan to say in court. Defence solicitors precognosce prosecution witnesses in the same way.</p> <p>You might wonder whether witnesses ever find a visit from the other side in any way intimidating. Even if everyone behaves impeccably, you might wonder why the two sides don't simply exchange written statements, as they do in England. And you might also wonder why nobody thought of changing the rules that left the prosecution with just 10 days to precognosce more than 100 defence witnesses, many of them living abroad.</p> <p>The judges have been fighting a losing battle to avoid unnecessary adjournments. Nearly two weeks were lost while defence scientists were interviewed. While that was going on, somebody rewired the courtroom; as a result, the sound system no longer worked and another day was wasted while technicians fixed it.</p> <p>Defence advocates had told the prosecution they wanted a crucial piece of evidence brought into court - a wrecked baggage container in which the bomb was allegedly placed. Prosecution lawyers did nothing to meet this entirely legitimate request. They pointed out that none of the doors in the specially-built courtroom was wide enough. So another day was lost while the baggage container was cut into two pieces.</p> <p>It would be wrong to blame Boyd for everything that has gone wrong. But he has admitted he was not ready for the start of the trial. That was understandable; he had only become Scotland's senior law officer a few months earlier when his predecessor, Lord Hardie, was appointed to the bench. And the prosecution team give the impression that they are struggling to keep up with events, that the defence have all the best tunes. With a trial as unbalanced as this, the fear is that justice will be the loser.</p> <p>Joshua Rozenberg is one of the BBC's correspondents at the Lockerbie trial</p>",

Without a solid framework, journalists must struggle to make sense of prosecution witnesses and defence cross-examination. When the evidence is so confusing, disjointed or repetitious, it's little wonder that news organisations find it hard to justify the cost of keeping reporters and television crews at the Scottish court in the Netherlands. Attempts to fill the information gap were made by a group of academics from Glasgow university. Unfortunately one of their number was a retired diplomat, Andrew Fulton, who'd spent time in Saigon and East Berlin; he was not to be seen again after the Guardian Diary guessed he must be from MI6. In this climate of conspiracy, it's hardly surprising that the Sunday Herald ran a story in Scotland last month headlined \"Lockerbie report leaves trial in chaos\". The specific story - that the prosecution had been forced to seek an adjournment because one of its star witnesses had cast doubt on where the bomb had been positioned on Pan-Am 103 - was roundly and convincingly denied by the Lord Advocate. But two things were true. A different prosecution witness, from the government's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, admitted under questioning by the defence that he had wrongly calculated the likely position of the bomb on board the aircraft, which could be crucial in establishing whether it was in the suitcase allegedly put on the plane in Malta by the two accused. And the prosecution had indeed been forced to seek an adjournment so it could examine new scientific evidence. That came about because of precognition, one of the mysteries of Scots law. Lawyers from the Procurator Fiscal's office - the nearest Scottish equivalent to the Crown Prosecution Service in England - visit defence witnesses before they give evidence and ask them what they plan to say in court. Defence solicitors precognosce prosecution witnesses in the same way. You might wonder whether witnesses ever find a visit from the other side in any way intimidating. Even if everyone behaves impeccably, you might wonder why the two sides don't simply exchange written statements, as they do in England. And you might also wonder why nobody thought of changing the rules that left the prosecution with just 10 days to precognosce more than 100 defence witnesses, many of them living abroad. The judges have been fighting a losing battle to avoid unnecessary adjournments. Nearly two weeks were lost while defence scientists were interviewed. While that was going on, somebody rewired the courtroom; as a result, the sound system no longer worked and another day was wasted while technicians fixed it. Defence advocates had told the prosecution they wanted a crucial piece of evidence brought into court - a wrecked baggage container in which the bomb was allegedly placed. Prosecution lawyers did nothing to meet this entirely legitimate request. They pointed out that none of the doors in the specially-built courtroom was wide enough. So another day was lost while the baggage container was cut into two pieces. It would be wrong to blame Boyd for everything that has gone wrong. But he has admitted he was not ready for the start of the trial. That was understandable; he had only become Scotland's senior law officer a few months earlier when his predecessor, Lord Hardie, was appointed to the bench. And the prosecution team give the impression that they are struggling to keep up with events, that the defence have all the best tunes. With a trial as unbalanced as this, the fear is that justice will be the loser. Joshua Rozenberg is one of the BBC's correspondents at the Lockerbie trial",

The Queen lifted her effective boycott of meeting Mrs Parker Bowles on Saturday at a 60th birthday party for King Constantine of Greece. The Queen had avoided meeting her son's mistress, but a royal source told the Guardian that she had been advised that \"the time was right\" for her to demonstrate at least a degree of acceptance about the heir to the throne's choice of companion. The meeting follows a choreographed rehabilitation of Mrs Parker Bowles' public image and represents a victory for the Prince of Wales's campaign to win acceptance for his divorcee friend in the face of newspaper criticism. Mrs Parker Bowles was blamed by Diana, Princess of Wales, for the break-up of her marriage to Prince Charles. Saturday's meeting took place at Prince Charles's home, Highgrove, and was witnessed by Princes William and Harry. It lies in sharp contrast to Prince Charles's 50th birthday celebrations in 1998. When the Queen discovered that Mrs Parker Bowles was hosting the event she refused to attend. The royal source said of the timing of Saturday's meeting: \"Basically we're talking about the public mood, and there's just been a very successful tour in Scotland, when the general assembly of the Church of Scotland was welcoming to the fact that the Prince of Wales was there with Mrs Parker Bowles.\" Attention will now focus on whether Mrs Parker Bowles will attend the next big royal function at Windsor Castle on June 21. This will mark not only the Queen Mother's 100th birthday, but the Duke of York's 40th birthday, Princess Margaret's 70th birthday, and Prince Willam's 18th birthday. In an enigmatic statement, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: \"The question of Mrs Parker Bowles' attendance of private royal family functions will depend on circumstances. \"There's not much to be gained by trying to long-range forecast these things.\" It was also stressed that Prince Charles has said that he has no plans to remarry.

It was full again, as it is every morning. Caroline has so many friends trying to contact her that it's almost a shame she isn't real. </p> <p>Caroline is the lead character in the interactive fiction Online Caroline that we launched on the web, with Freeserve, six weeks ago. In the first month thousands of people have gone online to meet Caroline, receiving one or more of her friendly, chatty, slightly needy emails and starting their journey through the episodic drama she inhabits. </p> <p>It is fascinating to watch the way people \"play\" this drama. Over 3,000 users have emailed Caroline or called her on her mobile. We set out to create an interactive drama, but we didn't think for a moment that Caroline would take on the life that she has. Caroline has become a believable character, created by my colleagues in XPT, the show's director and writer, Rob Bevan and Tim Wright, and by Mira Dovreni who plays Caroline. The strength of the character is partly the reason that people become so immersed in the whole thing, but there is something else going on here. </p> <p>First, there is the plot. There is the spooky fictitious XPT and its odd operatives who have set Caroline up in the first place, and for whom her mysterious boyfriend, David, played by Paul Duncan, works. There are her friends, whom she trusts, but perhaps shouldn't; her lifestyle, which she values but should perhaps leave behind; her own stumbling career which she should perhaps change; and her budgie who is perhaps her only ally. Apart from you, that is. </p> <p>Beyond the characterisations and the plot, there is the interactivity to hook users in. Getting interactivity right is complex. Users want to be told intriguing stories. They don't necessarily want to develop them themselves. Online Caroline is a very carefully written story, and the users' path through it is channelled so that, to an extent, we are dictating how they experience the story. There are no closed interactive moments where the user decides on one narrative route or another. All the narrative strands remain open, ready to be explored and presented in episodic form as the site updates with each visit. </p> <p>With online drama, usability and design also become key storytelling tools. Cinema and television currently have a passive user interface; we sit back and absorb the unfolding drama on the screen before us. On the web the technology is not yet there to allow this for a mainstream audience - and an interactive approach requires more involvement. An audience which is allowed to decide how it explores a narrative is just as likely to decide to go and explore another website as it is to investigate yours. The site design and functionality have to lure them in - each click has to offer a little narrative reward, a new piece of information, a new twist in the story. </p> <p>To begin with, some people think XPT has really placed a webcam in Caroline's house and the \"live\" pictures are of events happening as they watch. Witness the number of calls to Caroline's mobile, warning her that her house is being burgled. Some people are almost certain it is fiction, but Caroline's emails, which are now becoming increasingly tailored to the likes, dislikes and traits of the individual users, draw people in. She wants advice, she values your opinion, she likes you, and you are her friends - soulmates even. You can't desert her now, especially now boyfriend David is about to return from Africa. </p> <p> C aroline knows about you, she knows the name of your best friend, the colour of your hair, she even knows if you have been unfaithful or not, because you have told her. But when this information comes back to you incorporated into her emails, it doesn't matter that you told her all about it just three days before, it feels like she's known you all along. This allows the user to feel like an intrinsic part of the story, but without affecting the plot significantly. Users tailor the drama to themselves. </p> <p>This is a channelled, immersive drama. In the end people get involved with it, not because they are lonely and have nothing better to do, but because it is genuine drama, with strong characters and an interesting plot. The question of whether it is reality or fiction soon becomes irrelevant. People cease to care if it is true or not. They play along, they suspend their disbelief in order to enjoy the experience, and, importantly, it's an experience they feel part of. </p> <p>But then again perhaps they sign up because it is just a bit more fun than another cops or frocks drama on the telly. </p> <p>Tom Harvey is managing director of interactive entertainment company XPT Ltd.

      "body": "<p>After six months lurking in the offices of half a dozen internet start-up companies, I can confidently report that they are very . . . quiet. People who work in dot.coms love to claim that things move unbelievably fast in their business. A month in the internet is said to represent the experience and progress of a year anywhere else. I beg to differ. </p> <p>According to Mark Fletcher, founder of the email group service OneList.com, if you want to describe the start-up experience \"take every emotion you can imagine and multiply it by 100.\" After six months in the offices of half a dozen internet start-up companies, filming their progress for a television documentary series, we saw surprisingly little emotion. Fletcher himself, a self-confessed \"nerd by birth\", was calm and relaxed, typical of the informal, serious types who run the companies we filmed. </p> <p>Indeed, the pace of dot.com life was less frenetic than the mythology had led us to expect. Investment arrives months after it has been promised. Meetings with venture capitalists take forever to schedule. Even writing a business plan seems to take as long as writing a novel. </p> <p>But having millions of pounds of investors' money can make things happen. Dot.coms can hire new staff as quickly as they can find them. In the US, the British method of filling a job, by seeing several candidates before picking the best, is considered too slow. In most Silicon Valley start-up positions, if you don't take a plausible candidate as soon as the interview is over, it will be too late. </p> <p>A key staff member in a British company we filmed confessed she had been hired after falling into conversation with her new boss when sitting opposite him on a train. She knew nothing about the internet, and had never considered a job in it before that journey. </p> <p>The prevailing myth of dot.com life is to do with money. But asking most dot.commers about money produces the kind of weary sigh you get in Chicago if you ask about gangsters. The usual line is that the real satisfaction in internet businesses comes from providing great service for customers. </p> <p>One or two entrepreneurs were more open: Ernesto Schmitt, the founder of Peoplesound.com, said to be worth \u00a317m, told me he couldn't get a mortgage on the strength of that, and couldn't even borrow money to buy a car. Since the value of his stake in the company is only based on what investors are now paying for a slice of it, it really is theoretical money. But even that has a certain sentimental value. One dot.commer told me he cracked open a solitary bottle of champagne at home the evening he calculated that his stock options made him a paper millionaire. Being able to shrug off one's paper millions is a new status symbol: \"Of course it doesn't really mean much . . . yet.\" </p> <p>If Peoplesound's initial public offering (IPO) goes according to plan, even the most junior staff who joined when the company started last year could each make $5m. Staff joining today would still make about $160,000 from their share options. Ernesto Schmitt muses about the possibility of Peoplesound creating 100 millionaires at its IPO. Another company we filmed, Wcities, started by a 32-year-old former marketing consultant, Tan Rasab, is hoping for a valuation of about $500m on its flotation. That would make Tan and his wife, a co-founder, worth about $150m between them. </p> <p>If this seems like a lot of money, the standard line is that nobody earns it without working incredibly hard. That may be true, but on the whole internet offices seem to empty surprisingly promptly around 5.30pm. I don't think we came across anyone who had worked later than midnight. There were occasions when we wanted to get some shots of hustle and bustle, but had to give up because it was the end of the afternoon. We returned to our office at the BBC, where we make comparatively leisurely-paced political documentaries, to find everyone still on the phone and screaming at each other. </p> <p>The office of a typical start-up is more like a library in a new university. Email is the preferred medium of communication, often for people sitting next to each other. I had the feeling that talking (\"going offline\"), or making phone calls are considered, somehow, interruptions to the real work at keyboards. The dramas we had in mind before we started filming - stormy business deals, programmers working all night and sleeping on the floor, were few and far between. </p> <p>Being TV people on internet territory has been an interesting social situation: the start-ups realise that, even with a comparatively esoteric BBC2 series, we can provide them with more eyeballs in 40 minutes than they could hope to draw to their name and website in months or even years, without paying for a blitz of advertising. For our part, there's a realisation that we are watching the rapid development of something that will one day dominate - or swallow - television. And yet, for the moment, we have the upper hand. Everyone has television. When programmes are transmitted, they don't freeze, or force you to switch off before trying again. Television sets actually work. </p> <p>Feeling comfortable in a dot.com depends on buying into the mythology of the future. Anyone who sounds sceptical about world domination by the internet is dismissed as not \"getting it\". Nicholas Barnard, chief executive of Petspark, led a group of his staff to San Francisco, to visit their new US partners, Pets.com. Seeing the phenomenal growth of Pets.com gave the visiting Brits what Barnard called \"a sense of destiny\" about their own company's future. Unfortunately, since that visit in January, Pets.com shares have floated on the US stock exchange and have sunk from $12 to around $2. Pets.com has become something of an icon of the anxieties surrounding \"b to c\" (business to consumer) dot.coms. Undeterred, Petspark is still expanding, and is still planning to raise more money. </p> <p>Another dot.com myth is about youth. While there are many twentysomethings running successful internet companies, youth is not essential. Sally Robinson, a middle-aged farmer's wife in Yorkshire, started AmpleBosom.com, to sell bras and underwear to \"the larger lady\" from one of the farm outbuildings. Uniquely among the companies we filmed, Sally hopes to break even, and may even start to make a profit, on the loan of \u00a380,000 she took out to start the business. With orders of around \u00a31,000 a day, she has only three computers. A dot.com run on the same principles of her bed-and-breakfast business looks like a good idea in the current financial climate. </p> <p>Some dot.coms even import older people to create a better image for their team. \"Get some grey hair\" is the advice of Ernesto Schmitt of Peoplesound. He talks openly about hiring Martin Turner, a former president of Compuserve, because he was older. Turner, he says, gave his investors confidence. </p> <p>My colleagues and I have had a number of muttered job offers during the filming process. In the US, we found that the accepted way friendly venture capitalists say goodbye, even to TV people who have expressed no particular interest in changing careers, is along the lines of \"well, hope you're going to come back to us with some ideas of your own soon.\" It's nice to think money would be forthcoming if we ever felt like taking them up on the offer, but this is probably just the dot.com equivalent of \"you must look us up next time you're in the States\". </p> <p>To our surprise, we have also received a number of calls and furtive emails from people in internet start-ups who want to know how to get into television. One said he found his work in one of the trendier internet start-ups \"boring\". It's reassuring to think television still holds some attractions to new media types. It helps - just a little - to alleviate the oppressive feeling of almost everyone in television that they're missing out on something big. </p> <p>Charles Miller's series, Inside Dot Coms, begins tonight on BBC2</p>",

Sally Robinson, a middle-aged farmer's wife in Yorkshire, started AmpleBosom.com, to sell bras and underwear to \"the larger lady\" from one of the farm outbuildings. Uniquely among the companies we filmed, Sally hopes to break even, and may even start to make a profit, on the loan of \u00a380,000 she took out to start the business. With orders of around \u00a31,000 a day, she has only three computers. A dot.com run on the same principles of her bed-and-breakfast business looks like a good idea in the current financial climate. Some dot.coms even import older people to create a better image for their team. \"Get some grey hair\" is the advice of Ernesto Schmitt of Peoplesound. He talks openly about hiring Martin Turner, a former president of Compuserve, because he was older. Turner, he says, gave his investors confidence. My colleagues and I have had a number of muttered job offers during the filming process. In the US, we found that the accepted way friendly venture capitalists say goodbye, even to TV people who have expressed no particular interest in changing careers, is along the lines of \"well, hope you're going to come back to us with some ideas of your own soon.\" It's nice to think money would be forthcoming if we ever felt like taking them up on the offer, but this is probably just the dot.com equivalent of \"you must look us up next time you're in the States\". To our surprise, we have also received a number of calls and furtive emails from people in internet start-ups who want to know how to get into television. One said he found his work in one of the trendier internet start-ups \"boring\". It's reassuring to think television still holds some attractions to new media types. It helps - just a little - to alleviate the oppressive feeling of almost everyone in television that they're missing out on something big. Charles Miller's series, Inside Dot Coms, begins tonight on BBC2",

      "bodyText": "So deeply has psychoanalysis entered our lives that the latest Oxford dictionary lists 90 words derived from it. \"Abreaction\" doesn't crop up much over the breakfast table, but \"wish-fulfilment\" became one of the prime industries of the ensuing century. In The Case Of Sigmund Freud (11.0am, Radio 4) Lisa Appiganesi celebrates the publication centenary of The Interpretation Of Dreams. In this first programme she discusses Freud's cultural legacy with writers like AS Byatt and Hanif Kureishi. He was all set for a career as an actuary until diverted by a second-hand trombone. Now, after years of him playing it around the world, we're still listening to Chris Barber At 70 (8.30pm, Radio 2). Among the old stagers joining him at the Golder's Green Hippodrome are Van Morrison, Lonnie Donegan and Kenny Ball. None dreamed of a musical career stretching into the next century. They say they just carried on, waiting for the bubble to burst.",

      "body": "<p>A management model for civilisation? A test lab for utopian technology? A global love-in? A theme park ride around the future? After 150 years of existence, the World Exposition, or Expo as it is commonly known, is still a mystifying phenomenon. </p> <p>One crops up every few years, enticing millions of visitors into a deranged fun fair - usually somewhere outside a middle-ranking first-world city centre - with an array of architectural panache, spectacular events and previews of how the future is expected to pan out. They have invariably benefited their host towns, and have made the reputation of many an architect and designer, but how have they changed the outside world? Has the future ever panned out the way they said it would? Have they ever achieved anything beyond amusing and confusing the public? </p> <p>For Expo 2000, which began in Hanover last week, these questions are more pertinent than ever. This is, after all, the 21st century; both the dawning of a new era and the sell-by date for many of the utopian promises of Expos past. On the 160-hectare site, there are five huge shedfuls of exhibits addressing the typically Expo-esque theme of \"Humankind, Nature Technology: The creation of a new world\". Armed with a multimedia arsenal and with the emphasis on societal and ecological harmony, these exhibitions outline the future of work, transport, nutrition, etc, most of it sponsored by multinational corporations (there's a Coca-Cola machine on every corner - try buying a Pepsi at Expo 2000). </p> <p>At the far ends of the site, linked by cable car, are the national pavilions, which compete like an architectural version of the Olympics. Pavilions typically display the most cutting-edge design their countries can come up with, or create a tourist-friendly pastiche of vernacular styles, little of which sits easily alongside the ecological and environmental themes. </p> <p>Thus nations such as Portugal, Italy or Spain offer stylish, sober constructions, Nepal offers half a Hindu temple and half a Buddhist stupa stuck together, the United Arab Emirates a stage-set desert fortress, and Monaco a deluxe steel structure with a speedboat moored outside. The UK has effectively opted out of the game this time round, having burnt its fingers at Seville's Expo 92 with Nicholas Grimshaw's expensive ultra-rational structure (which is still sitting in crates somewhere waiting for a buyer). Britain's pavilion is easily the worst in Hanover: a cheap, off-the-shelf steel box filled with sub-trade fair exhibits and the original door from 10 Downing Street. </p> <p>Wandering around this collection of follies, there is a nagging sense that it's not the future we are looking at any more, it's the past: a nostalgic attempt to recapture the days when these things really mattered. Even the souvenir shops are still selling lava lamps and kinetic desktop sculptures. For Expo's purposes the future peaked in about 1969, just after the moon landing, when space travel was on the up and Stanley Kubrick's 2001 was taken more as a promise than a fantasy, when the limitations of the earth's resources and the damage humanity had inflicted on the environment were not yet fully acknowledged. Progress was a one-way street and all we needed were a few navigational aids. </p> <p>Expo 70, in Osaka, was the best attended World Exposition of all, with 64.2m visitors. Attractions included a giant inflatable US pavil ion (filled with trophies from the moon); Kenzo Tange's space-frame Japanese pavilion; the flying saucers of the Sumitomo Pavilion; and the Takara Beautilion, dedicated to the \"joy of being beautiful\" and graced by a daily international fashion show. </p> <p>Looking back, Expo 70 was possibly the largest monument to kitsch the world has ever created, a global tribute to triviality. But like every Expo before or since, it purported to offer serious architectural innovation. Clearly, there has been some straying from the path. The equation between progressive architecture and world exhibitions was once demonstrably successful. </p> <p>It is no coincidence that chapter one of Expo is also chapter one of modern architecture, and perhaps that is where the trouble started: Joseph Paxton's magnificent Crystal Palace was the high point of the first Expo, London's Great Exhibition of 1851. The steel-and-glass exhibition hall was the perfect test subject for Paxton's revolutionary construction techniques, which paved the way for skyscrapers to come. The result was stylish, practicable and radical, and Expo architecture has been expected to supply these qualities ever since. </p> <p>The formula continued to develop, particularly in London, Paris and the US during the 19th century, producing another futuristic landmark, the Eiffel Tower, in 1889, and introducing such innovations as the typewriter, Edison's gramophone, the automobile and the saxophone. Expos became so popular that a regulating body, the Bureau International des Expositions, was founded in Paris in 1928 to decide where, when and how Expos would be held. </p> <p>In the modern era, the list of archi tectural milestones that Expo produced is, on the face of it, respectable: Mies van der Rohe's 1929 Barcelona Pavilion; Frei Otto's tensile structures; the space frame; the geodesic dome; Moshe Safdie's Habitat 67 apartments; the monorail; the Ferris wheel; and, er, the Brussels Atomium. </p> <p>On closer inspection, however, the world has been conspicuously unaltered by these innovations. Take the monorail. A steam-powered prototype was unveiled at the Philadelphia World's Fair way back in 1876. It only travelled 500ft, but it was applauded none the less. Fast-forward 100-odd years, and where are all the monorails? Ah, there's one, at Expo 67, gliding into the US pavilion. Outside of Expo-land, monorails are still pretty thin on the ground; a few airports, the odd city centre, and theme parks, where they have been employed more for their futuristic associations than any practical advantage. </p> <p>Likewise for the geodesic dome. The aforementioned US pavilion for Expo 67 was an impressive 250ft-diameter three-quarter sphere by Mr Dome himself, Richard Buckminster Fuller. Again, the interior was devoted largely to space travel, but the highlight for visitors was simply entering this vast sphere - especially as they were travelling by monorail. The geodesic dome was an innovation, undeniably, but again, one which has failed to make an impression on our skylines. Aside from climbing frames, the only place you'll find geodesic domes is in theme parks and other Expos: the German pavilion at Osaka 70, Disney's Discovery Centre, the US pavilion at Seville 92. Given free rein to explore the wildest architectural fantasies in a parallel universe, little of this Expo architecture has translated back into the real world. In fact, the prime beneficiary of Expo's innovations seem to have been Expo itself and its cousin, the theme park. </p> <p>Paxton's Crystal Palace satisfied the demands both for new aesthetic forms and for practicable technological advancement, but today's Expo architecture has absolved itself of the latter responsibility, reducing itself to a series of theatrical emblems and stylistic pointers. It's not architecture, it's Expotecture. </p> <p>This explains why the architecture at Expo 2000 is a freestanding diversion while the serious future-divining takes place elsewhere. Only one or two designs try to address the problems of the outside world. The Dutch pavilion attempts a radical layered reorganisation of urban space (even if the \"forest\" level is actually made of hollowed out tree trunks with steel girders inside). And the Japanese pavilion, designed by Shigeru Ban, elegantly satisfies all requirements. It is a tranquil, translucent tunnel made entirely of paper: beautiful, progressive and totally recyclable. </p> <p>It is fitting that Japan will host the next world Expo, in Aichi in 2005. A radically different approach has been outlined, along the lines of \"rediscovering nature's wisdom\". Instead of levelling and denuding a natural site then importing architecture and landscaping, the organisers intend to place eco-friendly buildings between the natural features of the woodland site, and to address issues such as conservation and recycling waste. No national pavilions, no monorails. It might be the end of Expo as we know it, but hopefully, it's where the real future begins.</p>",

Russian police declined to provide many details of the circumstances surrounding Adi Sharon's abduction. He was held for a ransom that was never paid and the boy's father was on hand on Friday after crack units of heavily armed special police stormed the bleak cellar where the teenager was being held outside the town of Penza in western Russia. During the incarceration, the boy's tormentors severed parts of his little fingers and sent them to his father, demanding an $8m ransom (\u00a35m) for his release. A police video of the rescue operation showed the boy looking pale and terrified as paramilitary police secured an end to his ordeal. Emaciated and gaunt, he was barely able to walk. He was taken to a Moscow hospital, where he spent the weekend. Russian state television showed him surrounded by breathing equipment and being treated with glucose drips. The Russian authorities blamed Chechen gangsters for the kidnapping. Moscow has been at war with Chechen separatist guerrillas for eight months. In the three years prior to the outbreak of the war, hundreds of Russians and foreigners were kidnapped in Chechnya in an epidemic of hostage-taking. Russian officials say that hundreds of hostages are still being held in the breakaway republic, including many foreigners.

Intrigued that her reputation could have travelled so far, Morley put an ad in a Manchester paper, asking anyone who had known her in the mid-80s to get in touch. The resulting interviews with many of Manchester's most famous names (club promoter Alan Wise, writer Dave Haslam, Pete Shelley, lead singer of The Buzzcocks) make up The Alcohol Years, Morley's wonderfully frank and intimate film study of the person she once was.</p> <p>It had been a time of excess, of drinking, of sex. Lots of sex. Morley was the girl who always left with someone; she was up for anything and everyone knew it. \"Manchester was a real boys' town and I would freak people out because I'd fuck anybody, men or women. And of course I had this huge reputation.\"</p> <p>Morley's father had committed suicide when she was 11 and, as her mother's world fell apart, she was left to her own devices. At 13, she was hitting the local nightclubs every night, drinking the men under the table. \"I'd have a bottle of Thunderbird before I went out, to take the edge off. Then it was spirits and cocktails all night. There was definitely a competitive side to it.\"</p> <p>Back then, Morley dressed like a child, carried toys around with her and was desperate to be liked; these days she is a youthful 34-year-old, at ease with herself, who talks about her past as though it happened to someone else. Like Tracey Emin's quilted list of all the men she ever slept with, The Alcohol Years is a challenge to those who would write off a promiscuous woman as \"just another slag\" and tut disapprovingly at those who refuse to hide their sexuality under a sensible skirt. But because Morley took everything to extremes, the film pushes even the most liberated among us to confront our own boundaries of what is, and is not, acceptable behaviour.</p> <p>We see Morley only fleetingly in The Alcohol Years and her decision to keep herself mostly absent provides a large part of the film's power. Morley may have had the reputation, but here she is unpeeling its construction. For this is a film about attitude and myth: in presenting their perceptions of Morley as they remember her, the men and women on screen become part of a study of both the power of memory and the endurance of received morality.</p> <p>Dave Haslam (author of Manchester, England) describes how he was unique as the man Morley read books with and never slept with, and suggests that she had actually been sexually ill. \"It's a very male response, don't you think?\" Morley says. \"I mean, women used to be locked away in mental institutions for far less.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless there are shocking revelations here: picking up old blokes off the street, shagging the gas man (\"Actually, it was the postman\"), charging for sex. \"I just thought if I was going to do it, I might as well get paid. It was quite a desperate time, I had nowhere really to live and it was an easy way to make some money. I don't think it's a big deal and I think it's funny how prostitutes are made out as these terrible transgressors.\"</p> <p>And perhaps it isn't such a leap from sleeping with the guy who bought you dinner, to putting out in order to be put up, to asking for cash. Many might see it as either brave or completely crazy, though, to be so open about it. \"I don't think it was brave because I wouldn't have gone back without the camera. It was always there, mediating for me and protecting me. And I didn't ever think about it being seen as self-publicising, which is ironic because at that time, all I wanted was to be noticed. When you're a teenager, you only define yourself through other people's eyes.\"</p> <p>Despite being aware of her erstwhile notoriety, Morley was still surprised at how much people had to say about her. The 40 hours of interviews at times proved gruelling, caused her unpleasant dreams and made her question the entire project. \"It was so strange, because before we filmed, I didn't tell any of them anything about my life now, so some people still thought they knew me. When I saw Alan Wise, it was so weird because he had his hands all over me, but then he surprised me with the degree of tenderness and thoughtfulness he got over on film. It was nice because this was a man I cried after I shagged because I couldn't believe I'd done it and then he turned out to be all right, really.\"</p> <p>Morley left Manchester abruptly; in the narrative of the film, her departure is precipitated by an impressionistic sequence of what could be interpreted as a rape scene. She left it ambiguous because she didn't feel the need to be explicit: \"It wasn't a rape scene, but that happened somewhere else, by someone I knew. That night was more to do with losing control, drinking too much and starting to become really paranoid.\"</p> <p>So is it a cautionary tale? \"I think there are consequences to actions, but I also think that attempts to control promiscuous women are often expressed as concern for their wellbeing. You get pushed inside by fear and made to disappear.

      "body": "<p>In Bergen, on Norway's craggy west coast, it rains so much that an umbrella comes as standard in swankier hotel rooms. This moist way of life does not dampen spirits in the place - far from it. But it does mean that even in the height of summer, when other parts of the country are basking in sunshine almost round the clock, Bergen can be masked by drizzle. And in Norway's famously lights-out winter, Bergen can be wild and wet and dark, almost round the clock </p> <p>No surprise, then, that in this context House/Lights, the latest project from New York performance troupe the Wooster Group, was received in an unusual fashion at this year's Bergen international festival. If it can be said to be about anything, House/Lights is about Faust making a pact with the Devil so that he can invent electricity. In Paris they howled with laughter, apparently; in Glasgow, I'll wager, there will be some rolling in the aisles. In Bergen, its last stop on tour before the UK, they loved it, but it got a rather sombre reception all the same. \"People here,\" says Roy Faudree, one of the Woosters in the show, \"have said to us, yes, life is different if you lose the boundary between day and night, and it hardly ever gets dark, or light.\" </p> <p>Life - theatrical life, at least - is also different in the Woosters, the ensemble of artists who, for more than 20 years, have worked on productions stretching every received notion of theatre. The only pattern in the radical yet accessible history of work under the direction of co-founder Elizabeth LeCompte is the group's restaging of classic texts incorporating found materials, films and videos, dance and music. </p> <p>Eugene O'Neill has had the Wooster treatment, as has Chekhov's The Three Sisters (in Brace Up!, the last Wooster production seen in the UK, at Tramway in 1992). Their next project is a stage version of Racine's Ph\u00e8dre (their radio version - a work in progress of sorts - can be heard on Sunday on Radio 3). Now, though, it's the turn of Gertrude Stein's 1939 opera-libretto Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights, a tricksy number even by Stein's impenetrable standards. \"Someone heard that the Wooster Group was doing Stein,\" laughs Faudree, \"and they said, 'They deconstruct texts - Stein is already deconstructed. What are they gonna do, put it back together again?' \" </p> <p>For a long time, LeCompte admits, the group did not exactly know what they were going to do with Stein's highly literary, highly abstract text in which she throws out conventional syntax, grammar, character and plot. After a year of musing and almost giving up on it, a friend showed LeCompte a film, Olga's House of Shame, a Joseph Mawra cult B-movie from 1964 available only, appropriately enough, from an outfit called Something Weird Video. The film has an excitable plot featuring female dominance, submission, and soft-core seduction. If that weren't enough, the plot then meets, apart from Stein, Mel Brooks's Young Frankenstein, Senor Wences (a Spanish ventriloquist who appeared on US television in the 50s), I Love Lucy and just about every big musical, police shoot-out, car chase and slapstick moment from American popular culture you can think of. Weren't they satisfied with just the Stein? </p> <p>\"The Mawra was the under- pinning for the whole thing. I don't think I would have done the Stein without it,\" explains LeCompte, reminding us that she comes to the classics via mass media and not the other way around. \"I like the Mawra with Stein, it's almost a joke on her - she who eschewed any linear story. We've put a linear story right through it; we start at the beginning and tell it to the end. The only way I could do that was to do what she does in her writing and that's to bring in what's happening at the moment and repeat it until it infects and subverts everything else.\" </p> <p>LeCompte's grounding in mass culture and sub- culture is just one of the reasons she can open up these classic texts for new audiences. That, and her steely intellect and great sense of humour - clearly a huge shaping force in the work to date. The third Wooster I speak to is Kate Valk, a co-founder of the group, along with the likes of Spalding Gray and Willem Dafoe. Her two characters in House/Lights are Faustus and Elaine (the ones tempted by power and ill-gotten gain in both narratives). She is very much the centre of the show, reciting Stein's unwieldy lines in an Eleanor Roosevelt voice, in a set that resembles a drug-fuelled video concept for the the craziest Tom Waits song imaginable. How does she hold it all together, with all the sound and fury around her - the barking dog, the six TV screens, the talking viper, the sounds from a Powerbook keyboard pinging through the action, let alone a very kinky sub-text? </p> <p>For Valk, who also directs and stars in the radio version of Ph\u00e8dre, it's all about the simple, almost miraculous parallels between the two main texts, somehow uncovered by LeCompte. \"There are so many connections - in the film, the voiceover actually says 'to make her mad is to invoke the Devil itself' - and they get beyond the problem we were first faced with: how to do the Stein? It has got all the baggage of being important and the Mawra has that of being not important enough. And have you ever seen productions of Stein? Formal black dress, abstract movements, carefully spoken words. We had to have a world to place that in, our world.\" The Wooster world and ours, too.

      "bodyText": "In Bergen, on Norway's craggy west coast, it rains so much that an umbrella comes as standard in swankier hotel rooms. This moist way of life does not dampen spirits in the place - far from it. But it does mean that even in the height of summer, when other parts of the country are basking in sunshine almost round the clock, Bergen can be masked by drizzle. And in Norway's famously lights-out winter, Bergen can be wild and wet and dark, almost round the clock No surprise, then, that in this context House/Lights, the latest project from New York performance troupe the Wooster Group, was received in an unusual fashion at this year's Bergen international festival. If it can be said to be about anything, House/Lights is about Faust making a pact with the Devil so that he can invent electricity. In Paris they howled with laughter, apparently; in Glasgow, I'll wager, there will be some rolling in the aisles. In Bergen, its last stop on tour before the UK, they loved it, but it got a rather sombre reception all the same. \"People here,\" says Roy Faudree, one of the Woosters in the show, \"have said to us, yes, life is different if you lose the boundary between day and night, and it hardly ever gets dark, or light.\" Life - theatrical life, at least - is also different in the Woosters, the ensemble of artists who, for more than 20 years, have worked on productions stretching every received notion of theatre. The only pattern in the radical yet accessible history of work under the direction of co-founder Elizabeth LeCompte is the group's restaging of classic texts incorporating found materials, films and videos, dance and music. Eugene O'Neill has had the Wooster treatment, as has Chekhov's The Three Sisters (in Brace Up!, the last Wooster production seen in the UK, at Tramway in 1992). Their next project is a stage version of Racine's Ph\u00e8dre (their radio version - a work in progress of sorts - can be heard on Sunday on Radio 3). Now, though, it's the turn of Gertrude Stein's 1939 opera-libretto Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights, a tricksy number even by Stein's impenetrable standards. \"Someone heard that the Wooster Group was doing Stein,\" laughs Faudree, \"and they said, 'They deconstruct texts - Stein is already deconstructed. What are they gonna do, put it back together again?' \" For a long time, LeCompte admits, the group did not exactly know what they were going to do with Stein's highly literary, highly abstract text in which she throws out conventional syntax, grammar, character and plot. After a year of musing and almost giving up on it, a friend showed LeCompte a film, Olga's House of Shame, a Joseph Mawra cult B-movie from 1964 available only, appropriately enough, from an outfit called Something Weird Video. The film has an excitable plot featuring female dominance, submission, and soft-core seduction. If that weren't enough, the plot then meets, apart from Stein, Mel Brooks's Young Frankenstein, Senor Wences (a Spanish ventriloquist who appeared on US television in the 50s), I Love Lucy and just about every big musical, police shoot-out, car chase and slapstick moment from American popular culture you can think of. Weren't they satisfied with just the Stein? \"The Mawra was the under- pinning for the whole thing. I don't think I would have done the Stein without it,\" explains LeCompte, reminding us that she comes to the classics via mass media and not the other way around. \"I like the Mawra with Stein, it's almost a joke on her - she who eschewed any linear story. We've put a linear story right through it; we start at the beginning and tell it to the end. The only way I could do that was to do what she does in her writing and that's to bring in what's happening at the moment and repeat it until it infects and subverts everything else.\" LeCompte's grounding in mass culture and sub- culture is just one of the reasons she can open up these classic texts for new audiences. That, and her steely intellect and great sense of humour - clearly a huge shaping force in the work to date. The third Wooster I speak to is Kate Valk, a co-founder of the group, along with the likes of Spalding Gray and Willem Dafoe. Her two characters in House/Lights are Faustus and Elaine (the ones tempted by power and ill-gotten gain in both narratives). She is very much the centre of the show, reciting Stein's unwieldy lines in an Eleanor Roosevelt voice, in a set that resembles a drug-fuelled video concept for the the craziest Tom Waits song imaginable. How does she hold it all together, with all the sound and fury around her - the barking dog, the six TV screens, the talking viper, the sounds from a Powerbook keyboard pinging through the action, let alone a very kinky sub-text? For Valk, who also directs and stars in the radio version of Ph\u00e8dre, it's all about the simple, almost miraculous parallels between the two main texts, somehow uncovered by LeCompte. \"There are so many connections - in the film, the voiceover actually says 'to make her mad is to invoke the Devil itself' - and they get beyond the problem we were first faced with: how to do the Stein? It has got all the baggage of being important and the Mawra has that of being not important enough. And have you ever seen productions of Stein? Formal black dress, abstract movements, carefully spoken words. We had to have a world to place that in, our world.\" The Wooster world and ours, too. As the Devil might say, do what you have to for a ticket. House/Lights is at Tramway, Glasgow, June 7-10. Box office: 0141 287 3900. Racine's Ph\u00e8dre is broadcast on Radio 3 at 7.30pm on June 11.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Pandemonium in the kitchen of David Willetts, Conservative politician and family man. Children in pyjamas and catapults at large. Cries of \"Ker-cha\" as pellets whizz off in the direction of the guinea pigs in the garden. Bottles of Bud falling out of the fridge (\"I'll just pop open another two, shall I?\"), cheese and onion crisps tumbling from a cupboard. Then an unidentified crash.</p> <p>\"What's that, my love?\" calls Willetts. His wife Sarah, an artist, emerges from behind a canvas. She's barefoot. \"Just me, knocking over the Pok\u00e9mon Gameboy,\" she says cheerfully. She's holding a rabbit which is chewing something. \"Aha!\" says Willetts. \"Cottontail!\" \"I've got a new way of holding him,\" she says, swivelling round to show us, \"so he can look out.\" For a moment we all look at Cottontail looking out at us. The Willetts family may not have a newborn baby at hand, Blair-style, but at least they have a rabbit.</p> <p>Willetts is the Conservative party's current great hope. As shadow welfare spokesman he has been behind, or to be more precise, in front of, the new Tory pension plans (among other things, restoring war widows' pensions to women who remarry), and the dismantling of Labour's New Deal. Six months ago, he says, no one would report a word he said: \"When you whinged, they said, 'Come up with something then.' And if you came up with something, they said, 'We're not interested, you'll never be in power anyway.'\"</p> <p>But now - with a tightening in the opinion polls - not a week goes by without \"what I regard as a meaty statement\" on this single parent or that social policy. He is, in his own words, \"on a bit of a roll\". Last week, his office even issued a press release containing excerpts \"from a letter to his constituency chairman\". Actually, he confesses, it wasn't even a letter. It was just a joke. \"I went into Central Office and I said, 'God, all these recycled Labour initiatives, it's like Groundhog Day.' And they said, 'You've got to get that out. We'll send that out: Brown's Groundhog Day.'\" He gets quite excited remembering his own joke. He laughs a lot. His voice goes high and cracks. \"It is, isn't it? All these repeats. Over and over again. It is. It is.\"</p> <p>More vitally, in a party that is rather low right now on small infants and soft animals, Willetts, 44, MP for Havant, is the closest thing to a photo opportunity. Banish all memory of \"two brains\", of his nerdy days in the Treasury or the Downing Street Policy Unit, or the Thatcherite director of the Centre of Policy Studies. Erase from your mind his clever-dick dissembling in the Cash for Questions enquiry. Ignore references to him as \"the most intelligent man in the Tory party\". Think touching domestic detail. Think fridge magnets. (Though, actually, his fridge magnets are those black and white words that generally turn into rude poems.)</p> <p>We're sitting in his west London garden as the sun goes down over the fruit trees and Willetts is smiley and chatty and for lots of the time, as the light catches his glasses, and the rabbit nibbles his ankles, he looks less like the son of Douglas Hurd and Michael Howard, and more like the tax inspector in The Darling Buds of May who's wandered into a different world and grown to like it.</p> <p>When he was a minister, he said, he neglected the family, hardly saw his own kids (Imogen, 12 , Matthew, eight) in the week at all. Now, he always gets them up and takes Imogen to school \"which is worth a hell of a lot\". He says this is where the Tories went wrong at the last election. \"People thought we either didn't grapple with school runs, or we didn't care about them. We were trapped with economics - like the Oscar Wilde quote, we knew the price of everything the value of nothing.\" It wasn't the election that drove that home, but the death of Princess Diana.</p> <p>\"I used to think there was this thing called Public Policy and Public Man and Woman, and that you turned up at the Commons and you donned your toga and you were a Roman senator and whatever your family life, or your personal background, you set that aside. And rightly or wrongly, that is disappearing. Nowadays, in order to engage you can't say, 'Here I am, a guy in a suit who has a view about a better social security system' without people wanting to know where you're coming from. If you are to be an effective opposition you can't just sit in a thinktank having bright ideas, you have to communicate them, you have to reach people at the level of emotion. Princess Di's death was the most vivid encapsulation of that.\"</p> <p>He uses his new pension plans as an example of how he has learnt to tap into how people think. Critics of the new proposals might say he's just rearranging the same money into different parcels. Exactly, he says. \"Even if there wasn't even an extra penny - and it so happens there is from the New Deal, for example - it would still be the right thing to do. The economists might think that the contributory factor, how the money is broken down, is mumbo jumbo, irrelevant - stop eating the flowers Cottontail! But in terms of psychology for pensioners it does matter. The guaranteed weekly pension is an entitlement, what's owing to them; special schemes for heating or TV licences is a Gordon Brown handout. For pensioners it's a big difference. Labour failed to value that. Shall we let Cottontail have a crisp? No, no Cottontail, not the flowers, a crisp. No!\"</p> <p>He's learned some lessons of a more personal nature, too. He's learnt, he says, not to be as ambitious as he was. \"I've seen enough marriages break up . . . there is real life to be got on with. Though, obviously,\" he adds quickly, \"I am ambitious to be social security secretary of this country.\" He's learnt to smile at opprobrium, the Tory infliction. \"In 97, we felt like we were a bleeding corpse in the gutter,\" he says with a big grin, \"but they just wanted to give you a final kick to check you were inert.\" He giggles. He's become a dab hand at the political insult.</p> <p>Did he admire Blair's response to Diana's death? \"At the time, yes,\" he says. \"I think Blair is too saccharine and syrupy but early on and in small doses, like all very sweet things, it went down very nicely.\" In general, he finds Labour \"a strange mixture of the complacent and the nervy. They remind me of one of those sea creatures which if you get too close suddenly retract or change shape.\"</p> <p>He has also become adept at his own political defence. A common charge laid at his door is that he's a fly-by-night, the economics-driven Thatcherite who transmogrified smoothly into the softer Majorite. \"Aha!\" he says. \"My politics did change but that was when I had Imogen and Matthew. As I was just saying to my good friend Danny Finkelstein, my definition of a Conservative is a free-marketeer with children.\" And, anyway, he adds, Thatcher had a wider context, too, religion \"which in our increasingly secular society had no purchase in political debate and just seemed eccentric\".</p> <p>And then there's the arrogance. And the whole sleaze parade. In 1996, during questioning by the Standards and Privileges Committee, Willetts tried to explain away a memo he had written as a junior whip regarding Neil Hamilton by playing with definitions of the word \"want\" (in the phrase \"he wants advice\"). The committee found him guilty of \"dissembling\"; others of being too clever by half.</p> <p>\"Too clever by half,\" he says in his garden, four years on. \"The big Tory criticism. I probably did try to argue my way out. It was chastening. Until then I thought you could argue your way round anything. It was the right thing to resign straight away [he was paymaster general] and it did bring me down to earth with a bump. As a political event it was dreadful. But personally it was marvellous. Sarah was still here and my friends were supportive. We tried to protect the children, though I discovered Imogen did see the cover of the Mirror with me pictured as some ogre. Still, the ups and downs of politics.\"</p> <p>It was a bit more than that, though, wasn't it? You did all behave very badly? There's a long silence. A dog barks next door. The guinea pigs squeak. \"Were there misdemeanours? Were there mistakes? Were there personal failings? Yes. Was there a widespread perception that we were sleazy? Yes. But nothing on the scale of Ecclestone paying his million pounds and as a result getting his meeting with Tony Blair which enabled policy on advertising on Formula One to change . . .\"</p> <p>For a moment, he forgets to look repentant. \"It all started with Back to Basics. After that people thought that any Tory MP who wasn't happily married was a hypocrite. But I would say the family is far too important to be left to saints. It should be possible to say, 'I am a fallen man. I've had my share of failings.

      "bodyText": "Pandemonium in the kitchen of David Willetts, Conservative politician and family man. Children in pyjamas and catapults at large. Cries of \"Ker-cha\" as pellets whizz off in the direction of the guinea pigs in the garden. Bottles of Bud falling out of the fridge (\"I'll just pop open another two, shall I?\"), cheese and onion crisps tumbling from a cupboard. Then an unidentified crash. \"What's that, my love?\" calls Willetts. His wife Sarah, an artist, emerges from behind a canvas. She's barefoot. \"Just me, knocking over the Pok\u00e9mon Gameboy,\" she says cheerfully. She's holding a rabbit which is chewing something. \"Aha!\" says Willetts. \"Cottontail!\" \"I've got a new way of holding him,\" she says, swivelling round to show us, \"so he can look out.\" For a moment we all look at Cottontail looking out at us. The Willetts family may not have a newborn baby at hand, Blair-style, but at least they have a rabbit. Willetts is the Conservative party's current great hope. As shadow welfare spokesman he has been behind, or to be more precise, in front of, the new Tory pension plans (among other things, restoring war widows' pensions to women who remarry), and the dismantling of Labour's New Deal. Six months ago, he says, no one would report a word he said: \"When you whinged, they said, 'Come up with something then.' And if you came up with something, they said, 'We're not interested, you'll never be in power anyway.'\" But now - with a tightening in the opinion polls - not a week goes by without \"what I regard as a meaty statement\" on this single parent or that social policy. He is, in his own words, \"on a bit of a roll\". Last week, his office even issued a press release containing excerpts \"from a letter to his constituency chairman\". Actually, he confesses, it wasn't even a letter. It was just a joke. \"I went into Central Office and I said, 'God, all these recycled Labour initiatives, it's like Groundhog Day.' And they said, 'You've got to get that out. We'll send that out: Brown's Groundhog Day.'\" He gets quite excited remembering his own joke. He laughs a lot. His voice goes high and cracks. \"It is, isn't it? All these repeats. Over and over again. It is. It is.\" More vitally, in a party that is rather low right now on small infants and soft animals, Willetts, 44, MP for Havant, is the closest thing to a photo opportunity. Banish all memory of \"two brains\", of his nerdy days in the Treasury or the Downing Street Policy Unit, or the Thatcherite director of the Centre of Policy Studies. Erase from your mind his clever-dick dissembling in the Cash for Questions enquiry. Ignore references to him as \"the most intelligent man in the Tory party\". Think touching domestic detail. Think fridge magnets. (Though, actually, his fridge magnets are those black and white words that generally turn into rude poems.) We're sitting in his west London garden as the sun goes down over the fruit trees and Willetts is smiley and chatty and for lots of the time, as the light catches his glasses, and the rabbit nibbles his ankles, he looks less like the son of Douglas Hurd and Michael Howard, and more like the tax inspector in The Darling Buds of May who's wandered into a different world and grown to like it. When he was a minister, he said, he neglected the family, hardly saw his own kids (Imogen, 12 , Matthew, eight) in the week at all. Now, he always gets them up and takes Imogen to school \"which is worth a hell of a lot\". He says this is where the Tories went wrong at the last election. \"People thought we either didn't grapple with school runs, or we didn't care about them. We were trapped with economics - like the Oscar Wilde quote, we knew the price of everything the value of nothing.\" It wasn't the election that drove that home, but the death of Princess Diana. \"I used to think there was this thing called Public Policy and Public Man and Woman, and that you turned up at the Commons and you donned your toga and you were a Roman senator and whatever your family life, or your personal background, you set that aside. And rightly or wrongly, that is disappearing. Nowadays, in order to engage you can't say, 'Here I am, a guy in a suit who has a view about a better social security system' without people wanting to know where you're coming from. If you are to be an effective opposition you can't just sit in a thinktank having bright ideas, you have to communicate them, you have to reach people at the level of emotion. Princess Di's death was the most vivid encapsulation of that.\" He uses his new pension plans as an example of how he has learnt to tap into how people think. Critics of the new proposals might say he's just rearranging the same money into different parcels. Exactly, he says. \"Even if there wasn't even an extra penny - and it so happens there is from the New Deal, for example - it would still be the right thing to do. The economists might think that the contributory factor, how the money is broken down, is mumbo jumbo, irrelevant - stop eating the flowers Cottontail! But in terms of psychology for pensioners it does matter. The guaranteed weekly pension is an entitlement, what's owing to them; special schemes for heating or TV licences is a Gordon Brown handout. For pensioners it's a big difference. Labour failed to value that. Shall we let Cottontail have a crisp? No, no Cottontail, not the flowers, a crisp. No!\" He's learned some lessons of a more personal nature, too. He's learnt, he says, not to be as ambitious as he was. \"I've seen enough marriages break up . . . there is real life to be got on with. Though, obviously,\" he adds quickly, \"I am ambitious to be social security secretary of this country.\" He's learnt to smile at opprobrium, the Tory infliction. \"In 97, we felt like we were a bleeding corpse in the gutter,\" he says with a big grin, \"but they just wanted to give you a final kick to check you were inert.\" He giggles. He's become a dab hand at the political insult. Did he admire Blair's response to Diana's death? \"At the time, yes,\" he says. \"I think Blair is too saccharine and syrupy but early on and in small doses, like all very sweet things, it went down very nicely.\" In general, he finds Labour \"a strange mixture of the complacent and the nervy. They remind me of one of those sea creatures which if you get too close suddenly retract or change shape.\" He has also become adept at his own political defence. A common charge laid at his door is that he's a fly-by-night, the economics-driven Thatcherite who transmogrified smoothly into the softer Majorite. \"Aha!\" he says. \"My politics did change but that was when I had Imogen and Matthew. As I was just saying to my good friend Danny Finkelstein, my definition of a Conservative is a free-marketeer with children.\" And, anyway, he adds, Thatcher had a wider context, too, religion \"which in our increasingly secular society had no purchase in political debate and just seemed eccentric\". And then there's the arrogance. And the whole sleaze parade. In 1996, during questioning by the Standards and Privileges Committee, Willetts tried to explain away a memo he had written as a junior whip regarding Neil Hamilton by playing with definitions of the word \"want\" (in the phrase \"he wants advice\"). The committee found him guilty of \"dissembling\"; others of being too clever by half. \"Too clever by half,\" he says in his garden, four years on. \"The big Tory criticism. I probably did try to argue my way out. It was chastening. Until then I thought you could argue your way round anything. It was the right thing to resign straight away [he was paymaster general] and it did bring me down to earth with a bump. As a political event it was dreadful. But personally it was marvellous. Sarah was still here and my friends were supportive. We tried to protect the children, though I discovered Imogen did see the cover of the Mirror with me pictured as some ogre. Still, the ups and downs of politics.\" It was a bit more than that, though, wasn't it? You did all behave very badly? There's a long silence. A dog barks next door. The guinea pigs squeak. \"Were there misdemeanours? Were there mistakes? Were there personal failings? Yes. Was there a widespread perception that we were sleazy? Yes. But nothing on the scale of Ecclestone paying his million pounds and as a result getting his meeting with Tony Blair which enabled policy on advertising on Formula One to change . . .\" For a moment, he forgets to look repentant. \"It all started with Back to Basics. After that people thought that any Tory MP who wasn't happily married was a hypocrite. But I would say the family is far too important to be left to saints. It should be possible to say, 'I am a fallen man. I've had my share of failings. But this is what I believe in.'\" It's getting a bit cold and the rabbit has given up eating the pansies so we go inside where a piano practice has just finished and pans are boiling on the stove. Matthew, still busy with his complicated catapult, tells me how to make a simpler one with a pencil and an elastic band. \"It's very useful in French lessons,\" he says. \"Because French is very boring.\" Willetts, who had his hand on his wife's shoulder, laughs fondly, strokes his son's back. \"You seem to rather like opposition,\" I say. He says, straightening up, \"It's different. You have to adjust. But I think that . . . yes, in terms of political ideas and everything, I find it quite satisfying.\"",

Drawn by their memories, several of the Dunkirk veterans said they would like to return to the town privately at least one more time. \"A mate of mine always used to say he came back so he could search in the sand for the arm he left behind here in 1940,\" said Bert King, 81. \"My excuse isn't quite as good as that. I got taken off in a destroyer, and I never even got my feet wet. But I'd still like to come back again if I'm up to it. You don't easily forget what happened here.\" Enthusiastic local families, a dozen deep, lined the parade's route as they have done nearly every year since commemorations began in the 1950s. Jo and Milo van Dyck, 65-year-old locals who remembered as small children the blazing oil tanks that marked the beginning of the near-total destruction of their town, said that the old soldiers were heroes. \"They were young men, many just 21 or 22,\" said Mr van Dyck. \"You have to respect what they did. We sometimes laugh at this British custom of celebrating what was really a terrible defeat, but we should remember they came back to fight here again. France wouldn't be France without them.\" Almost lost in the crowd were a couple of hundred forgotten French veterans of Dunkirk. Some 120,000 French soldiers were among those taken off the beaches. Almost all were shipped to England and were then sent straight back to France, where after travelling south to where the French army was still nominally engaged, they were promptly taken prisoner. \"My memories of Dunkirk are mixed,\" admitted Denis Chaillons, 84. \"The British had the luxury of being able to go home; we didn't,\" he said. \"They went back as heroes; we returned to ignominy, a humiliating military catastrophe of epic proportions. France just wants to forget us.\"",

The materials are already present in nature having done their \"alleged damage\". All customers using the products have not been officially notified about known effects nor [do] our labels carry this information. </b> <br>Memo from Monsanto committee studying PCBs, 1969 <p> In a small brick house strung year-round with Christmas lights, behind curtains made of flowered sheets, Jeremiah Smith is listening to his favourite preacher on the radio. As tonight's instalment of the gospels winds down, he takes a seat at a table draped with a zebra-print cloth and drifts back 30 years, to the brief period when he was a pig farmer. Like others in Anniston, Alabama, Smith used to raise vegetables and livestock in his yard to provide additional food for his family. </p> <p>\"We were poor people,\" he says, in a thick drawl. \"We had to raise food ourselves . . . We were trying to survive and live.\" Smith also had a cow and rabbits, but most of his time and attention went to his pigs. In 1970 he had about 50 - too many for his small plot of land, so he led them past the labyrinth of pipes and smokestacks that surrounded the Monsanto chemical plant his father helped build, to a grassy hill where they could graze. Each evening, Smith would give them some feed and, when the need arose, he would bring home some bacon. </p> <p>One night, as he was feeding the pigs, a man from the Monsanto plant drove up the hill and made him an offer: $10 apiece for the pigs and a bottle of whisky. Smith had begun to notice that something was wrong with some of his pigs anyway; their mouths had turned green. And, ever in need of cash, he could hardly afford to pass up $500. He sold. But for more than 20 years, he wondered what on earth a chemical company would want with his pigs. </p> <p>Many people Jeremiah Smith's age are old enough to remember Monsanto's glory days in Anniston. The company provided well-paid jobs and helped nurture this friendly southern town's sense of community. Most never thought to connect the chemical industry to some of the odder features of life there. Like the creek, known locally as \"the ditch\", which passed through town carrying water that ran red some days, purple on others and occasionally emitted a foggy white steam. </p> <p>But over time, the residents of Anniston came to believe that they had been poisoned for decades by Monsanto. The change in attitude was spurred by what at first seemed a straightforward real estate transaction. In December 1995, Donald Stewart, a former state legislator who served briefly in the US Senate, received a phone call from Andrew Bowie. A deacon at the Mars Hill Missionary Baptist church, Bowie explained that a Monsanto manager had approached him about buying the church. \"It doesn't seem like we're going to achieve a satisfactory deal,\" Bowie told Stewart. \"I think we need a lawyer.\" </p> <p>\"I thought it was a simple case,\" Stewart says. \"It just mushroomed.\" </p> <p>Stewart soon learned that Monsanto wanted to buy the church because it had discovered high concentrations of PCBs in the area and was planning a clean-up. </p> <p>Before production was restricted in the US, PCBs were used as insulating material in various types of electrical appliances, including television sets. They are non-flammable and take the form of either oily liquids or solids. </p> <p>After an open meeting at the church, Stewart began fielding a flood of calls from concerned residents, who had a dizzying array of health problems which they now attribute to the contamination. The neighbourhood around the plant is populated by people with cancer, young women with damaged ovaries, children who are learning-impaired and people whose ailments have been diagnosed as acute toxic syndrome. The question is, are these illnesses caused by exposure to PCBs? Medical studies have shown that PCBs may cause liver problems, skin rashes and developmental and reproductive disorders in humans, and the US department of health and human services has determined that PCBs \"may reasonably be anticipated to be carcinogens\". </p> <p>In addition to the church, which filed its own suit against Monsanto, more than 3,000 Anniston residents who have high levels of PCBs in their blood and on their property have filed suits against the company since 1996, alleging that the company knew it was introducing PCBs into the environment, knew the hazards of doing so, failed to inform the community and tried to conceal what it had done. Monsanto denies the allegations. </p> <p>Karen McFarlane lives in plain view of the plant. It's a mild morning in February and she didn't sleep much last night. Clothed only in a T-shirt and underwear, with a sweater draped over her lap, she lights her first cigarette of the morning and promptly drops it on the shaggy blue rug. Dakota, McFarlane's 16-month-old, is playing with the severed head of a Barbie knock-off and there's not much to eat in the house. But Karen has other worries: she has PCBs in her body fat. </p> <p>According to tests done by a local doctor, her husband Ryan's blood has nearly triple the level considered \"typical\" in the US; for Tiffany, their six-year-old, it's double. Nathan, eight, has severe developmental problems, and everyone in the family suffers from respiratory problems and the skin rashes associated with PCB exposure. Chris, McFarlane's 11-year-old son, lifts his T-shirt to reveal brownish-red blotches climbing up the sides of his chest. \"It smells like decaying flesh,\" Ryan warns. \"Like it's rotten.\" </p> <p>Most of their friends and family have already left, but the McFarlanes can't afford to. Karen was recently hospitalised for respiratory-stress disorder and had two strokes at the age of 30. Ryan, who has small pink growths dotting his neck, wistfully talks of going to an oncologist for a full cancer screening, something he's unlikely to get soon because he does not have health insurance. The McFarlanes are stuck in a place where, according to the Alabama department of public health, cancer rates are 25% higher than in the rest of the state. Whether these health problems are linked to Monsanto's PCBs is at the heart of the case. </p> <p>While it concedes that much of Anniston is contaminated by PCBs, Monsanto says its chemical discharges were negligible - and maintains that it did not fully understand how PCBs affected the environment at the time they were released, in the 60s and 70s. The US government didn't restrict the manufacture of PCBs until 1979. </p> <p>\"As soon as we discovered there were PCB discharges from the plant, we began our operations to limit and hopefully eliminate those discharges,\" says Bob Kaley, director of environmental affairs for Monsanto's chemical division. \"At the time, there were no federal regulations with regard to PCBs . . . Everything was done voluntarily, and there was really almost no understanding of the effect of PCBs on the environment and human health. I think as we've moved forward in the past 30 years, there are potentially some effects at high levels in the environment. But we do not believe even today that there are concerns for human health at those environmental levels.\" </p> <p>The Anniston case stands out in the annals of PCB litigation in the extent of damage to property and people it alleges. It is also among the first brought by ordinary citizens rather than corporations. The black binders the plaintiffs' lawyers have filled with internal memorandums and reports are branded \"Hot Documents\" and \"Hottest Documents\" with yellow Post-it notes. Many have never been seen by the public but they will become public record when the trial begins and could make or break Monsanto's defence. </p> <p>The chemical producers arrived in Anniston during the first world war, and in 1929, the Theodore Swann Company became the nation's first maker of PCBs. By 1935 Monsanto recognised PCBs as big business and bought Swann's Anniston facility. </p> <p>In the 60s, a team of Swedish researchers discovered that PCBs were present in the environment. Each time the chemical prevented an electrical wire from overheating, some of it had been escaping. </p> <p>At the time, the government had not yet declared PCBs to be hazardous to human health, but suspicions had been growing for quite a while. In 1956 Monsanto considered the chemicals toxic enough to give workers protective gear and clothing. Along with other chemical manufacturers, the company publicly expressed scepticism about PCBs' association with disease, but over the next decade the evidence became harder to ignore. Studies published in leading medical journals showed that PCBs may damage the immune system, the reproductive system and the nervous and endocrine systems. </p> <p>Monsanto had hundreds of millions of dollars in PCB sales to lose if regulators placed restrictions on use. By 1969 the company established a committee to keep abreast of the state of knowledge on PCBs. The issue was beginning to look like \"a monster\", in the words of one former executive. </p> <p><b>\"The Dept of Interior and/or state authorities could monitor plant outfall and find [discharges] of chlorinated biphenyls at . . . Anniston anytime they choose. This would shut us down depending on what plants or animals they choose to find harmed.\"</b><br>Monsanto researcher, 1969 </p> <p>At issue in the Anniston lawsuit is whether the company was aware of the extent and harmful effects of the PCB contamination and whether it could have protected or warned the community. Many of the answers may be found in the documents. According to a 1970 report, Monsanto was dumping about 7.2kg (16lb) a day of PCB waste into the town's waterways. The year before, the company had been dumping about 113kg (250lbs) a day. </p> <p>Monsanto began commissioning animal toxicity studies in the early 70s; the results did not look good. \"Our interpretation is that the PCBs are exhibiting a greater degree of toxicity in this study than we had anticipated,\" an executive wrote. </p> <p>In 1975 the lab submitted its findings from a study using rats. An early draft said that in some cases, PCBs had caused tumours. George Levinskas, a Monsanto manager, wrote to the lab's director: \"May we request that the report be amended to say 'does not appear to be carcinogenic'.\" The final report dropped all references to tumours. </p> <p>Anniston residents got their first glimpse of Monsanto's troubles with PCBs in late 1993. A contractor dredging on the nearby Choccolocco creek noticed largemouth bass with blistered scales. Tests showed the fish contained extremely high levels of PCBs. Around the same time, the Alabama Power company broke ground on land it had acquired from Monsanto in the 60s, opening up a PCB landfill that bled black tar. Alabama Power insisted that Monsanto take back the land and reported its discovery to the Alabama department of environmental management. Soon after, the company made its quiet buyout offer to the church. </p> <p>But Adam Peck, one of Monsanto's lawyers, isn't sweating. The company, which spun off its chemical division as a stand-alone firm, Solutia, in 1997, assigned an environmental manager to lead a $30m clean-up operation. They bulldozed buildings, laid thick plastic tarpaulins over the contaminated land and covered them with clean soil. The company plans to convert some of the contaminated land into a wildlife refuge. It has built perching posts near the landfill to attract purple martins. In Peck's mind, these activities demonstrate convincingly that the corporation has behaved responsibly. \"We have offered to acquire property. We've offered to clean property. What does that mean? Does that mean we acted responsibly or that we should have done more?\" After a pause, he adds: \"I'm not sure what more we could have done.\" </p> <p>Residents are anxiously awaiting the EPA's decision on whether to order a federal clean-up. The lawsuit is also taking longer than residents anticipated. Two weeks before the case was to go to trial, in March 1999, Monsanto appealed to the state supreme court to establish procedural rules for the circuit court. The court still hasn't returned its rulings. </p> <p>In the meantime, Stewart prepares for trial and works on other cases. He's hoping the jury will award compensatory damages for the property contamination and punitive damages for the fear the exposure has engendered. He also wants Monsanto to pay for regular health screenings. </p> <p>Early settlement talks went nowhere, both sides say. Monsanto did settle the original suit on behalf of the Mars Hill congregation. It made no admission of guilt but paid $2.5m (\u00a31.5m) to rebuild the church at another location. \"In the Mars Hill case they protested all the time that they didn't do a thing,\" Stewart says. \"Then they paid $2.5m for a church they said was worth $400,000. I wonder how they arrived at that decision.\" </p> <p>After he sold them, Jeremiah Smith's pigs were shot and buried. Why? Because, Monsanto says, it was concerned about them trespassing on company property. </p> <p>\u00a9 The Nation</p>",

I have you now: it's Darth Vader! Prowse played the Empire's asthmatic bootboy in the original three Star Wars films. He doesn't look like Darth Vader. Prowse has been peeved these 20 years that both his face - when Vader was unmasked - and his voice were replaced by those of other actors. Peeved? Of the distinguished thespian James Earl Jones, who supplied Vader's voice, Prowse will concede only that \"he is very famous for phone commercials\". So what else is Prowse famous for? He was Britain's Strongest Man between 1965 and 1970, and once shredded phone books under the stage-name Jack the Ripper. Prowse is so hard he even trained Christopher Reeve to be Superman. The Force is strong in this one. Royalty agrees - Prowse is to be garlanded by the Queen tomorrow. For services to acting? I don't think his performance in Frankenstein and the Monsters from Hell would justify it. I find your lack of faith disturbing. Quit the quotes - or I'll force you to watch The Phantom Menace. Anything but that . . . No, Prowse is being MBE'd for services to charity and road safety - he was the Green Cross Code Man in the 70s, and now runs the charity David Prowse Forces Against Arthritis.

Most of the reports are from Cornwall, Devon, Somerset, parts of Wales, Northumberland and the River Severn catchment. Over the past 20 years the number of adult male otters killed in road traffic accidents in Wales has increased fivefold, with 40 animals found in 1998 compared with an average of eight between 1980 and 1989. Eight otters were killed on roads near the River Axe, on the Devon and Somerset border, in the past three months - nearly a fifth of the estimated otter population on the river.

Sarel Gous will visit Belfast this week for talks about building a successor to the Titanic, which sank on her maiden voyage in 1912, killing 1,500 people. Titanic II would be the biggest cruise liner in the world - larger than the original Belfast-built Titanic, and would even dwarf the Queen Mary 2, whose contract the Harland and Wolff shipyard failed to win several weeks ago. Mr Gous, who has already had talks with the head of the technical department at Harland and Wolff, is due to return on Friday for discussions with Belfast city council. Harland and Wolff said it regularly received calls from around the world asking about the chances of building a new Titanic, immortalised recently in a Hollywood blockbuster. The company was satisfied Mr Gous was serious about building the ship, which would now cost more than \u00a3500m. He approached the yard's technical services division two years ago and paid for a feasibility study on the commercial viability of reconstructing the Titanic. While a new Titanic would not be an exact replica, it could have the same external lines and level of luxury, the company said. But under the skin it would be a very modern ship. A former Lord Mayor of Belfast, assemblyman and Titanic buff Ian Adamson, who had discussions with Mr Gous on his previous visit, does not believe people would be put off by the tragedy. He said: \"This is not a pipe dream. The magic of the Titanic name would make this the cruise ship the rich and famous would want to sail on.\"",

Yet he may face a humiliating backlash at the ballot box, all because of one remark. Mr Mori is backed by the biggest coalition in post-war Japanese history, the opposition is weak and the economy is at last starting to pick up after years in the doldrums. But his popularity is in free fall. After hitting a high of about 40% two months ago - when he took over from the dying Keizo Obuchi as prime minister - his approval rate has slumped to a dismal 12%. This curse can be traced back to a single sentence Mr Mori uttered last month, which raised an issue that many Japanese would rather ignore: religion. At a gathering of lawmakers promoting the indigenous Shinto religion, Mr Mori said that Japan was a \"country of gods with the emperor at its core\". Critics say those words, repeated daily by every newspaper and television station in the country, are a throwback to the pre-war era of religious nationalism, when Shinto taught that the emperor was a god and Japan a divine nation. Mr Mori has repeatedly denied that this was his intention, but on Saturday he put his foot in it again by referring to the need to protect the Japanese kokutai (national essence); a concept associated with the pre-war Shinto beliefs. \"It was an unbelievable mistake,\" said Professor Takeshi Sasaki of Tokyo University. \"I've never seen such an unpopular prime minister.\" After the war, in which millions of Japanese died fighting for a supposedly divine emperor, the separation of religion and state was enshrined in the constitution.
