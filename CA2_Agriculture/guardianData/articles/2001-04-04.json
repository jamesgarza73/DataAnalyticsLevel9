      "body": "<p>Jonathan Bloomer, Prudential's youthful chief executive, cut short a family holiday in the Caribbean last night to fight for his reputation after his ambitions to turn the Pru into a player on the global insurance stage appeared ruined. </p> <p>The dream of transforming the Pru from a household name in Britain into an international powerhouse through the record-breaking \u00a318bn takeover of American General appeared to be shattered by an audacious counter-bid launched by the mighty AIG late on Tuesday night. </p> <p>Even the \u00a3408m poison pill in the terms of the Pru's agreement with American General, announced only three weeks ago, was not enough to deter New York-based AIG, the world's largest insurer, from crashing the unpopular deal. For AIG, the chance to challenge Citigroup as America's largest financial services company is at stake. </p> <p>This means that instead of securing the role of running a much larger insurance company, the sixth biggest in the world, Mr Bloomer is in danger of being regarded as being at the helm of a relatively small player which could become a sitting duck for predators. </p> <p>The City, which had doubts about the American General takeover at the outset, was preoccupied with listing the financial companies which might consider running a slide rule over the Pru. Names such as Allianz, embroiled in a takeover of Dresdner Bank, ING, Aegon and Axa were cited, along with banks such as HSBC. </p> <p>While a bid for the Pru was regarded as far from imminent, investors said Mr Bloomer had provided the ammunition for any potential bidder when he announced his bid for American General, whose management was to replace that at his troubled US insurance arm Jackson Life. By securing as much as 65% of its revenues from the US, Pru hoped to reduce its reliance on Britain - where the government's plans for low cost pensions are hurting profits - and find money for further expansion in Asia. </p> <p>One shareholder said: \"The trouble for the Pru is when they made this bid they opened up their shirts and showed just how much cash the Asian business needed - which it doesn't have - and that the US was in more of a mess than we first thought. </p> <p>\"This is why they needed American General to sort them out. So it's a distinct possibility that any company with a lot of cash could come along and bid. The only problem is that one of them, AIG, is now out of the picture.\" </p> <p>Yet AIG's veteran chief, Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg, engaging in classic bid war rhetoric, rubbished any interest in the Pru. \"All the Pru has really is a UK business that was evaporating and a small business in the US. It's not the same fit.\" </p> <p>As the odds of success appeared to stack against the Pru, which had been caught napping by AIG, the Pru insisted its deal was intact, describing it tersely as being in \"full force and effect\".

      "bodyText": "Jonathan Bloomer, Prudential's youthful chief executive, cut short a family holiday in the Caribbean last night to fight for his reputation after his ambitions to turn the Pru into a player on the global insurance stage appeared ruined. The dream of transforming the Pru from a household name in Britain into an international powerhouse through the record-breaking \u00a318bn takeover of American General appeared to be shattered by an audacious counter-bid launched by the mighty AIG late on Tuesday night. Even the \u00a3408m poison pill in the terms of the Pru's agreement with American General, announced only three weeks ago, was not enough to deter New York-based AIG, the world's largest insurer, from crashing the unpopular deal. For AIG, the chance to challenge Citigroup as America's largest financial services company is at stake. This means that instead of securing the role of running a much larger insurance company, the sixth biggest in the world, Mr Bloomer is in danger of being regarded as being at the helm of a relatively small player which could become a sitting duck for predators. The City, which had doubts about the American General takeover at the outset, was preoccupied with listing the financial companies which might consider running a slide rule over the Pru. Names such as Allianz, embroiled in a takeover of Dresdner Bank, ING, Aegon and Axa were cited, along with banks such as HSBC. While a bid for the Pru was regarded as far from imminent, investors said Mr Bloomer had provided the ammunition for any potential bidder when he announced his bid for American General, whose management was to replace that at his troubled US insurance arm Jackson Life. By securing as much as 65% of its revenues from the US, Pru hoped to reduce its reliance on Britain - where the government's plans for low cost pensions are hurting profits - and find money for further expansion in Asia. One shareholder said: \"The trouble for the Pru is when they made this bid they opened up their shirts and showed just how much cash the Asian business needed - which it doesn't have - and that the US was in more of a mess than we first thought. \"This is why they needed American General to sort them out. So it's a distinct possibility that any company with a lot of cash could come along and bid. The only problem is that one of them, AIG, is now out of the picture.\" Yet AIG's veteran chief, Maurice \"Hank\" Greenberg, engaging in classic bid war rhetoric, rubbished any interest in the Pru. \"All the Pru has really is a UK business that was evaporating and a small business in the US. It's not the same fit.\" As the odds of success appeared to stack against the Pru, which had been caught napping by AIG, the Pru insisted its deal was intact, describing it tersely as being in \"full force and effect\". Mr Bloomer, in regular contact with his advisers at UBS Warburg during his hasty flight back to the City, was said to remain convinced about the long term merits of the union with American General. That cut little ice with City and Wall Street analysts and investors, who appeared convinced that the Pru's ambitions would end in tears. A fight with the fearsome AIG, almost eight times bigger than the Pru, would garner little support from shareholders concerned that the price offered was too high - even if it might result in long term rewards. Only the fact that potential bidders probably had their hands temporarily full as a result of rapid consolidation in the insurance industry dampened expectations of an unwanted bid for the Pru, whose shares have lost some 20% of their value during recent weeks. Even yesterday's rise in the Pru's share price - at one stage a dramatic 12% but 7% by the close at 795.5p - was not enough to recover the losses it had endured since what was billed as the largest yet transatlantic merger was announced. Its embarrassing end followed an inauspicious start on the day last month which arguably marked the start of the current stock market rout.

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England today cut interest rates for the second time this year. The monetary policy committee announced its decision at midday to shave 0.25% off the official cost of borrowing, which brings the figure to 5.5%. Inflation is running well below the government's 2.5% target and the decision is thought unlikely to have any adverse affect on the economy. But when the committee makes its decision, it weighs up the possible inflationary pressures of buoyant consumer spending and a strong housing market if the rates are eased. The last cut - also 0.25% - was in February. Industry and unions had said that another was needed to inject confidence into the British economy to protect from the slowdown in the United States. The Bank decided against a cut last month, noting that there were few signs the US's economic troubles had crossed the Atlantic. However, foot and mouth is now beginning to affect the economy. Hotels and restaurants suffered a sharp fall in sales last month, dragging growth in the services sector down to its weakest rate for six months, according to the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. Transport companies too are reporting that the disease has put the breaks on their business. Another cut is not expected in May. The Bank's governor, Sir Edward George, insists that decisions will not be influenced by the election but many believe it would be reluctant to act at such a politically sensitive time. The minutes of the meeting leading up to the Bank's decision are published on its website a fortnight today.

      "bodyText": "One of the train operating companies planning to introduce inflation-busting fare increases next month gave a \u00a31m pay and shares package to its chief executive last year. Phil White, who has headed National Express since 1997, received a 17% increase in his basic pay to \u00a3350,000, plus a \u00a3233,000 performance bonus, up from \u00a3150,000 in 1999. Other benefits totalled \u00a319,000 and there was a \u00a3140,000 pension contribution. Mr White cashed in share options to generate a further \u00a3244,656, taking his total pay and shares package to \u00a3986,656. He sold his options at 900p, which was 5p short of the peak price last year. Details of Mr White's remuneration are in the train and bus company's annual report and accounts, which have just been sent to shareholders. National Express includes train companies Midland Mainline, Silverlink, WAGN, ScotRail and Gatwick Express. Its coach operations include National Express, Express Shuttle, Airbus and Flightlink, and it provides bus routes in the west Midlands. The company confirmed yesterday that passengers using its Midland Mainline services face fare increases of up to 5% from May. Mr White, 51, still has options worth \u00a31m, including a tranche awarded last year, although half of those cannot be converted into cash until April 2003. A spokeswoman for the company said the increase in Mr White's basic pay and bonus were performance-related. He had not received an increase last year and the company had expanded abroad. \"We prefer to look at the figures over a longer period of time. We now have a bigger, international business with some 30 subsidiaries\". \u0095 John Bryant and Fokko van Duyne, joint chief executives of steelmaker Corus who were ousted last year, have been urged to hand some their combined \u00a32m in pay-offs to the 6,000 steelworkers facing redundancy and the dole.

The decision was taken by the Bank of England's nine-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). Their main aim is to keep inflation rates low. It is likely that the postponement of the election encouraged the rate cut. The MPC looks to stay out of politics and will be unlikely to make any further changes in the run up to the election.",

      "body": "<p>After Ridley Scott's glossy digital scenery in Gladiator, Houston Ballet returns the land of the Caesars to a much more old-fashioned, theatrical tradition. Cleopatra (created last year) comes from the stable of big, plush story ballets with which director/ choreographer Ben Stevenson has made Houston's name. With the help of designers Thomas Boyd and Judanna Lynn and composer John Lanchbery it presses all the available buttons of classical dance theatre to create a work cosily tucked between the 19th and 20th centuries. </p> <p>Set against a gilded, painterly backdrop, the ballet boasts an array of expensive, crowd-pleasing effects, the most spectacular being Cleopatra's diva-style entrance when she appears to glide on stage in a jewelled barge. The choreography is set to an arrangement of Rimsky-Korsakov's concert and operatic music, giving it a period patina circa 1900. It aims for the scale of Spartacus, and the oriental opulence of La Bayad\u00e8re or Scheherazade. Though the cast isn't huge, Stevenson maximises the athleticism of Houston's dancers with spacious moves, inflected in the Egyptian scenes with flattened, hieratic poses and in the Roman scenes with a disputative political energy. </p> <p>There's little risk or novelty, but the movement services the story with purposeful clarity. The Roman senators dance with a blunt, muscular aggression, in contrast to the introvert homoerotic duets of Ptolemy and Pothinius as they plot against Cleopatra. Pothinius (Nicholas Leschke ) dominates the craven, diminutive Ptolemy (Mauricio Canete) in a seesawing game of sex and power. </p> <p>Cleopatra was created, however, as a ballerina vehicle, specifically for Houston's home-grown star, Lauren Anderson. Much has been made of Anderson's rarity as a black ballerina - and it's undeniable that her skin colour serves the ballet well. But it's her dramatic and technical gifts that are the real issue. Anderson is a tall, rangy dancer who combines a dynamic attack with musical elegance. She has a good instinct for Cleopatra's capricious nature, motivated by insolent sexuality and by queenly ambition. She is badly hampered, though, by Stevenson's oddly reticent choreography in her love duets with Caesar and Marc Antony, which fail to elevate her to the grand heroine mode that the format of the ballet requires. Cleopatra is one of the most famous, and fatal, female lovers in history, yet this role doesn't take her to any extremes of eroticism, passion, tenderness or loss. </p> <p>The work is without question an exercise in ballet populism and as such is professionally crafted with lots of dancing and energy. What will make it seem parochial to many London fans is less the fact that it's a stylistic throwback than its failure to go for broke in delivering a real old-fashioned love story. </p> <p>\u0095 In rep until Saturday.

      "body": "<p>An unexpected second-half comeback from Galatasaray stunned reigning European champions Real Madrid at the Ali Sami Yen Stadium last night. The Turks stormed back from 2-0 down at the interval with three second-half strikes to set up a mouth-watering second leg of their Champions League quarter-final at the Bernabeu in two weeks' time. </p> <p>Real had looked in a different class in the opening period - goals from Ivan Helguera and Claude Makelele emphasising their superiority - and the Turks looked beaten. But a penalty from Umit Davala was added to by strikes from Hasan Sas and Mario Jardel amid amazing scenes in Istanbul. </p> <p>The hosts were content to defend very deep in the opening stages and catch Vicente del Bosque's side on the break - but apart from a few long-range shots, most notably from Gheorghe Hagi, they failed to test Iker Casillas in the Real goal. </p> <p>Real could have taken the lead after 28 minutes following good work down the left from Roberto Carlos and Steve McManaman, but Luis Figo shot a foot wide of Claudio Taffarel's right post with his weaker left foot. </p> <p>He made amends just five minutes later by playing a crucial part in the opening goal. The Portuguese international whipped in a delightful free-kick from the right hand side, and central defender Helguera rose unchallenged to head powerfully past Taffarel for his fifth goal in this season's Champions League. </p> <p>Gala were still on the back foot when the visitors notched a crucial second shortly before half-time. Carlos' long throw was nodded by Raul into the path of Makelele, and the French international strode past a couple of despairing challenges before driving the ball under the goalkeeper. </p> <p>Makelele turned from hero to villain just two minutes after the restart by bringing down Sas in the area, and Umit converted the penalty with ease. </p> <p>The hosts poured forward - Brazilian striker Jardel coming close with two headers - before Sas sent the crowd into raptures with a deserved equaliser. Substitute Fatih Akyel raced down the right before squaring the ball for Sas, who smashed the ball low to Casillas' right with a first-time shot. </p> <p>With 15 minutes to go the comeback was complete - Akyel burst down the wing again, delivering an inch-perfect cross for Jardel to rise above Fernando Hierro and plant his header past Casillas.</p>",

      "bodyText": "An unexpected second-half comeback from Galatasaray stunned reigning European champions Real Madrid at the Ali Sami Yen Stadium last night. The Turks stormed back from 2-0 down at the interval with three second-half strikes to set up a mouth-watering second leg of their Champions League quarter-final at the Bernabeu in two weeks' time. Real had looked in a different class in the opening period - goals from Ivan Helguera and Claude Makelele emphasising their superiority - and the Turks looked beaten. But a penalty from Umit Davala was added to by strikes from Hasan Sas and Mario Jardel amid amazing scenes in Istanbul. The hosts were content to defend very deep in the opening stages and catch Vicente del Bosque's side on the break - but apart from a few long-range shots, most notably from Gheorghe Hagi, they failed to test Iker Casillas in the Real goal. Real could have taken the lead after 28 minutes following good work down the left from Roberto Carlos and Steve McManaman, but Luis Figo shot a foot wide of Claudio Taffarel's right post with his weaker left foot. He made amends just five minutes later by playing a crucial part in the opening goal. The Portuguese international whipped in a delightful free-kick from the right hand side, and central defender Helguera rose unchallenged to head powerfully past Taffarel for his fifth goal in this season's Champions League. Gala were still on the back foot when the visitors notched a crucial second shortly before half-time. Carlos' long throw was nodded by Raul into the path of Makelele, and the French international strode past a couple of despairing challenges before driving the ball under the goalkeeper. Makelele turned from hero to villain just two minutes after the restart by bringing down Sas in the area, and Umit converted the penalty with ease. The hosts poured forward - Brazilian striker Jardel coming close with two headers - before Sas sent the crowd into raptures with a deserved equaliser. Substitute Fatih Akyel raced down the right before squaring the ball for Sas, who smashed the ball low to Casillas' right with a first-time shot. With 15 minutes to go the comeback was complete - Akyel burst down the wing again, delivering an inch-perfect cross for Jardel to rise above Fernando Hierro and plant his header past Casillas.",

And yes, of course we're counting what's happened in this year's competition. CAN YOU HELP? Following on from last week's question about why more teams don't play in weird colours, John McBurnie wants to know why Dulwich Hamlet, who are currently languishing at the bottom of the Ryman League, chose \"their horrific pink-and-blue quarters strip\". Any ideas? \"What was the name of the Bournemouth civil servant who became the self-appointed mascot for England in the 60s?\" asks Bill. \"Can you tell me: (a) Who was the first black footballer to play for England U-21s?\" asks Lawrence Burton. \"Am I right in thinking that the save Peter Schmeichel made against Arsenal in the 1999 FA Cup semi-final is the only penalty save he ever made for United, excluding shoot-outs? Or even the only penalty which wasn't converted while he was playing?\" asks Richard Shaffer. \"Whatever happened to Sonny Pike?\" asks Dan Williamson. \"I'm certain that years ago I watched a documentary about him and learnt that he was England's brightest ever prospect. I am also sure that he trained with the Ajax youth side. Is he the only British player to have had this honour bestowed upon him?\" Trawl through The Knowledge archive.

The home secretary Jack Straw however said it was essential to move quickly to provide \"certainty\" for everyone involved in the elections. The guillotine measure had only had been introduced because the opposition frontbench was incapable of controlling its own backbenchers, he added. The elections bill is the result of prime minister Tony Blair's decision to delay the May 4 elections, the first postponement since the second world war. It sets June 7 as the date for the local polls - now widely expected to be the date of the general election as well, increases the amount candidates can spend on their campaign by 50% and allows for compensation payments. If it is approved by the Commons tonight it will go on to be discussed by the Lords tomorrow and next Monday, and it could become law by early next week. MPs are also being asked to speed through the elections (publications) bill tonight, designed to save political parties from having to pulp tens of thousands of election leaflets. It was introduced after the parties failed to spot an unexpected consequence of last year's political parties, elections and referendums act which revised regulations on the printing of election material such as posters.

The Advertising Standards Authority, which regulates all poster and press advertising, today issued a strong rebuke to the fashion retailer. The ASA said French Connection had \"brought the advertising industry into disrepute\" with advertising that was \"offensive and irresponsible\". The decision is unlikely to cause either French Connection or Mr Beattie many sleepless nights. The brand is aimed squarely at 18 to 30-year-olds, who are unlikely to be overly concerned at the use of those four letters - even when, as in the latest campaign, they are used in the phrase \"fcukinkybugger\". Despite French Connection's protestations that it didn't mean to offend, the campaign was the last straw for the ASA, which has so far been powerless to stop the company from using \"FCUK\" as its logo. But the campaign works precisely because the watchdogs don't like it. Mr Beattie's shock tactics mean the brand gets acres of media coverage every time the advertising regulator gives French Connection a ticking off. Depending on your opinion, FCUK is either a branding masterpiece or a cynical piece of media exploitation. But there is no doubt it has been a huge commercial success.

It's the sort of paranoia that made the United manager the top boss in the country, and gives us all a good laugh.</p> <p>But can Gerard match up to Sir Alex? We'll let you decide with our cut-out-and-keep comparison of the best bitching from the past few seasons. Let battle commence!</p> <p><strong>Gerard's gripes</strong></p> <p><strong>\"This is an unfair ruling which favours Ipswich. They obviously want Ipswich to be in the Champions League rather than Liverpool.\"</strong> </p> <p>Houllier adopts the classic everyone-hates-us ploy favoured by Fergie after hearing that the Premier League won't switch Liverpool's fixture against Ipswich.</p> <p><strong>\"Half of my team are England internationals. Nobody can complain now in June if they are suffering burn-out.\"</strong></p> <p>And a day later he's still banging on. Now who does that remind you of?</p> <p><strong>\"My advice to him is to shut up. He is not going to attract my attention by complaining in the media.\"</strong></p> <p>Houllier reminds Christian Ziege who's the boss, just like a certain United manager.</p> <p><strong>\"David Ginola is a criminal. I repeat, he is a criminal.\"</strong></p> <p>If you cross Houllier you pay the price, as Ginola found out after his error led to Bulgaria knocking France out of the World Cup in 1993.</p> <p><strong>\"It seems Alex [Ferguson] is touched by God this season. If he kicked a tin can across the street, it would probably land in the net.\"</strong></p> <p>Houllier whinges a la Fergie after United complete the treble.</p> <p><strong>\"When the players heard who was refereeing they said: 'It's like playing against 12, not 11'\"</strong></p> <p>And Houllier concentrates his ire on another favourite Fergie target: the referee. This time he's attacking Mike Reed after he sent off Jamie Carragher at Charlton in 1999.</p> <p><strong>Fergie's fury</strong></p> <p>Now here's <strong>Sir Alex</strong> doing what he does best.</p> <p><strong>\"When the Italians tell me it's pasta I check under the sauce to make sure it is. They're masters of the smokescreen.\"</strong> </p> <p>Fergie scents an Italian conspiracy before Manchester United's European tie against Internazionale, 1999.</p> <p><strong>\"He's a big-time Charlie,\"</strong></p> <p>The United boss puts Paul Ince in his place.</p> <p><strong>\"There's only one way I can describe Ian Wright's lunging, jump-in tackle on Peter Schmeichel at Highbury in February. If Eric Cantona had done the same, he would have been locked up on Devil's Island. For good.\"</strong></p> <p>Fergie uses his book 'A Manager's Diary: The Will To Win,' to put the boot into Ian Wright in '97.</p> <p><strong>\"He has no experience of English football - he has come from Japan - and now he's telling everyone how to organise our football. Unless you have been in the situation you should keep your mouth shut firmly shut.\"</strong></p> <p>Arsene Wenger also gets the Fergie treatment after he expresses his views about United's fixture backlog, also in '97.</p> <p><strong>\"They sit and admire the ground and wait to be entertained just as if they were at a theatre or musical We have a lot of visitors for whom it is a weekend holiday. That may be all right for some people but it is no use to me all the players.\"</strong></p> <p>Fergie rants about his own fans.</p> <p><strong>\"There is a terrible amount of jealousy towards Manchester United. I do not know why.\"</strong></p> <p>Finally, another favourite Fergie theme: jealousy, from 1997.</p> <p> <strong>Who wins?</strong> Send your opinions to <a href=\"mailto:football.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk\">football.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Is Gerard Houllier turning into the new Alex Ferguson? During the last 48 hours the Liverpool manager has lashed out at Ipswich, the Premier League ... and now poor Christian Ziege. It's the sort of paranoia that made the United manager the top boss in the country, and gives us all a good laugh. But can Gerard match up to Sir Alex? We'll let you decide with our cut-out-and-keep comparison of the best bitching from the past few seasons. Let battle commence! Gerard's gripes \"This is an unfair ruling which favours Ipswich. They obviously want Ipswich to be in the Champions League rather than Liverpool.\" Houllier adopts the classic everyone-hates-us ploy favoured by Fergie after hearing that the Premier League won't switch Liverpool's fixture against Ipswich. \"Half of my team are England internationals. Nobody can complain now in June if they are suffering burn-out.\" And a day later he's still banging on. Now who does that remind you of? \"My advice to him is to shut up. He is not going to attract my attention by complaining in the media.\" Houllier reminds Christian Ziege who's the boss, just like a certain United manager. \"David Ginola is a criminal. I repeat, he is a criminal.\" If you cross Houllier you pay the price, as Ginola found out after his error led to Bulgaria knocking France out of the World Cup in 1993. \"It seems Alex [Ferguson] is touched by God this season. If he kicked a tin can across the street, it would probably land in the net.\" Houllier whinges a la Fergie after United complete the treble. \"When the players heard who was refereeing they said: 'It's like playing against 12, not 11'\" And Houllier concentrates his ire on another favourite Fergie target: the referee. This time he's attacking Mike Reed after he sent off Jamie Carragher at Charlton in 1999. Fergie's fury Now here's Sir Alex doing what he does best. \"When the Italians tell me it's pasta I check under the sauce to make sure it is. They're masters of the smokescreen.\" Fergie scents an Italian conspiracy before Manchester United's European tie against Internazionale, 1999. \"He's a big-time Charlie,\" The United boss puts Paul Ince in his place. \"There's only one way I can describe Ian Wright's lunging, jump-in tackle on Peter Schmeichel at Highbury in February. If Eric Cantona had done the same, he would have been locked up on Devil's Island. For good.\" Fergie uses his book 'A Manager's Diary: The Will To Win,' to put the boot into Ian Wright in '97. \"He has no experience of English football - he has come from Japan - and now he's telling everyone how to organise our football. Unless you have been in the situation you should keep your mouth shut firmly shut.\" Arsene Wenger also gets the Fergie treatment after he expresses his views about United's fixture backlog, also in '97. \"They sit and admire the ground and wait to be entertained just as if they were at a theatre or musical We have a lot of visitors for whom it is a weekend holiday. That may be all right for some people but it is no use to me all the players.\" Fergie rants about his own fans. \"There is a terrible amount of jealousy towards Manchester United. I do not know why.\" Finally, another favourite Fergie theme: jealousy, from 1997. Who wins? Send your opinions to football.editor@guardianunlimited.co.uk",

However, it is not obvious that the law prevents robust rules of engagement. My experience of lecturing to senior UK officers suggests that they take a positive view of the laws of war.

Mr Griffiths, 31, got the nod from Mr Beattie and, taking charge of French Connection's marketing this week, walked straight into yet another row over the cheeky four-letter-word advertising. The ASA, exasperated with upholding complaints about the fcuk strapline, has consigned French Connection to having its adverts pre-vetted. Quite a baptism of fire for Mr Griffiths - not that he appears concerned. The epitome of the brand's laid-back image, he is taking it all in his stride. \"French Connection's cool, sexy image has been built through very powerful communications. There has been no attempt to offend people. The customers buy the clothes and love the imagery. \"My big challenge is to keep French Connection cool, sexy and exciting. The brand has a strong foundation, fantastic-looking stores and great product. The brand is not just about the advertising.\" But fcuk isn't finished yet. \"The basic idea is really strong and still has room for interpretation,\" says Mr Griffiths. It is hard to believe Mr Griffiths is new to the rag trade, he talks fluently about fashion, art, design, photography and haircare. He has spent the past three years immersed in shampoo as senior product manager of L'Oreal's salon ranges and in marketing at Charles Worthington. The shampoo years have undoubtedly given Mr Griffiths solid marketing experience. But his previous three years at Habitat provide the key to his snaring the enviable French Connection job. \"I have a passion for retail, on the high street you can really engage and excite people and get close to consumers,\" he said. But the nation's fashion victims are not the only people self-confessed shopaholic Mr Griffiths will be getting intimate with, he's on course for a close working relationship with the advertising industry watchdogs.

      "body": "<p>Matron has come a long way since the 18th century when she might earn \u00a310 a year, plus beer allowance, and \u00a35 bonus for \"good behaviour\". </p> <p>The high point of matron was probably the mid-20th century, when she patrolled wards and ruled nurses, domestics, and patients with iron discipline - although rarely had any real power over the strategic running of the hospital. </p> <p>The NHS matron became indelibly associated with the formidable character played by the late actress Hattie Jacques in the 1960s film Carry on Doctor. </p> <p>In 1966, however, matron was abolished, as nursing fashion shifted to a less rigid and hierarchical approach. </p> <p>By the 1990s, the decline in public confidence in the NHS was accompanied by frequent calls - particularly from delegates at Tory party conferences - for the health service to \"bring back matron\" in order to raise standards.</p> <p>Ironically, the Tories never took the opportunity to bring back matron during 18 years in charge of the NHS from 1979 to 1997, maintaining that it was up to local trusts to adopt the name \"if appropriate\".</p> <p>Health secretary Alan Milburn's decision to bring back matron reflects widespread public support for someone who they see as able to cut through NHS bureaucracy and ensure wards are clean and patients are treated with respect and dignity - a person they associate with \"matron\".</p> <p>Matrons will be essentially ward sisters with extra responsibilities including the management of ward level budgets for cleaning, catering and general ward environment. </p> <p>Mr Milburn says the modern matron will have the following:</p> <p><strong>\u0095 To lead by example</strong><br>Matron will lead the nursing team in groups of wards. They will demonstrate to other nurses the high standards NHS patients can expect; </p> <p><strong>\u0095 To make sure patients get quality care</strong><br>Matron will be responsible for driving up the standards of care, ensuring continuous improvement in nursing care, making sure every patient gets quality care; </p> <p><strong>\u0095 To make sure the wards are clean</strong><br>Matron will have the power to withhold payments to cleaning companies if cleaning standards are not met. They will oversee the standards of cleanliness of each of the wards in their charge;</p> <p><strong>\u0095 To make sure the food is good</strong><br> Matron will have the power to withhold payments to catering companies if standards of catering are not up to scratch. They will ensure patients get their meals and are able to eat them and that the nutritional needs of all patients are met; </p> <p><strong>\u0095 To make sure elderly patients are treated with respect</strong><br>Matron will have the power to ensure nurses and other NHS staff treat elderly patients with respect at all times. For example, matron will ensure elderly patients are addressed as they wish - using Mr or Mrs rather than more familiar first names; </p> <p><strong>\u0095 To improve the wards for patients</strong><br>Matron will oversee the spending of ward budgets. Each ward sister has a budget of \u00a35000 to improve the ward environment which nurses control. Matron will see that nurses do have the say over how this is spent and that ward budgets lead to real improvements for patients; </p> <p><strong>\u0095 To resolve problems for patients and their relatives</strong><br>Matron will work with the new Patients Advocacy and Liaison Service to resolve patient problems on the spot. They will be highly visible, with the authority to get things done; </p> <p><strong>\u0095 To prevent and control hospital-acquired infection</strong><br>Matron will ensure that the highest standards for preventing and controlling infection are set and met on every ward; </p> <p><strong>\u0095 To make sure nurses have more power</strong><br> Matron will ensure nurses have the power to order tests, admit and discharge patients, run clinics, triage patients and, where appropriate, prescribe medicines.</p>",

The high point of matron was probably the mid-20th century, when she patrolled wards and ruled nurses, domestics, and patients with iron discipline - although rarely had any real power over the strategic running of the hospital. The NHS matron became indelibly associated with the formidable character played by the late actress Hattie Jacques in the 1960s film Carry on Doctor. In 1966, however, matron was abolished, as nursing fashion shifted to a less rigid and hierarchical approach. By the 1990s, the decline in public confidence in the NHS was accompanied by frequent calls - particularly from delegates at Tory party conferences - for the health service to \"bring back matron\" in order to raise standards. Ironically, the Tories never took the opportunity to bring back matron during 18 years in charge of the NHS from 1979 to 1997, maintaining that it was up to local trusts to adopt the name \"if appropriate\". Health secretary Alan Milburn's decision to bring back matron reflects widespread public support for someone who they see as able to cut through NHS bureaucracy and ensure wards are clean and patients are treated with respect and dignity - a person they associate with \"matron\". Matrons will be essentially ward sisters with extra responsibilities including the management of ward level budgets for cleaning, catering and general ward environment. Mr Milburn says the modern matron will have the following: \u0095 To lead by example Matron will lead the nursing team in groups of wards. They will demonstrate to other nurses the high standards NHS patients can expect; \u0095 To make sure patients get quality care Matron will be responsible for driving up the standards of care, ensuring continuous improvement in nursing care, making sure every patient gets quality care; \u0095 To make sure the wards are clean Matron will have the power to withhold payments to cleaning companies if cleaning standards are not met. They will oversee the standards of cleanliness of each of the wards in their charge; \u0095 To make sure the food is good Matron will have the power to withhold payments to catering companies if standards of catering are not up to scratch. They will ensure patients get their meals and are able to eat them and that the nutritional needs of all patients are met; \u0095 To make sure elderly patients are treated with respect Matron will have the power to ensure nurses and other NHS staff treat elderly patients with respect at all times. For example, matron will ensure elderly patients are addressed as they wish - using Mr or Mrs rather than more familiar first names; \u0095 To improve the wards for patients Matron will oversee the spending of ward budgets. Each ward sister has a budget of \u00a35000 to improve the ward environment which nurses control. Matron will see that nurses do have the say over how this is spent and that ward budgets lead to real improvements for patients; \u0095 To resolve problems for patients and their relatives Matron will work with the new Patients Advocacy and Liaison Service to resolve patient problems on the spot. They will be highly visible, with the authority to get things done; \u0095 To prevent and control hospital-acquired infection Matron will ensure that the highest standards for preventing and controlling infection are set and met on every ward; \u0095 To make sure nurses have more power Matron will ensure nurses have the power to order tests, admit and discharge patients, run clinics, triage patients and, where appropriate, prescribe medicines.",

She just wants to blend into the background and it will be no different from having a work experience person around,\" one of the film's producers blithely told me. Yeah, right, I thought. I felt nervous about her arrival but her first words set the tone: \"Gosh, you're much younger and prettier than I thought you would be!\" - the first and, no doubt, the last time anyone will say that to me. She wasn't what I had anticipated - scrubbed, unaffected and dressed in neat, casual clothes, she fitted in straight away. We came up with a plan: she would be Bridget Cavendish, Bridget for obvious reasons and Cavendish as she was to be passed off as the sister of Jonathan Cavendish, a friend of one of our company chairmen. That last bit at least is true and no one was to know that Jonathan Cavendish was one of the film's producers. </p> <p>So she settled down to the daily round of answering the phones (and the way she says \"Hello - publicity\" in the film has an eerily familiar ring to it), ringing round the unsuspecting literary editors of national newspapers about various forthcoming publications, a smattering of photocopying and going through the newspapers for any book-related stories. This meant she had, more than once, to cut out incendiary tabloid stories fuming that \"our Bridget\" was to be played by an American. She kept her cool, but did scribble \"Rubbish\" in the margins of one particularly fanciful piece. </p> <p>No one took much notice of Bridget, the latest in a long line of work-experience people. The first glitch came on her first day proper in the office: her manager in New York sent her a lavish bouquet of long-stemmed roses, care of me, to wish her well in her new job. A nice touch, but tricky to explain away. Everyone assumed, of course, that they were for me, and as I blushingly stumbled to account for them, enquirers drifted off convinced that I either had a loaded admirer, or a few days to live, or possibly both. During one particularly persistent line of questioning, Ren\u00e9e just said mischievously, \"Actually, Camilla's pregnant; didn't you know?\", thereby mercifully defusing the situation. </p> <p>She and I were also a little alarmed to see that an American student who happened to be on a week's placement with us at that time had her nose stuck in a copy of the film tie-in edition of One True Thing, which Ren\u00e9e had starred in. But apart from the odd sidelong glance, she didn't seem to make the connection. I had to take just one person into my confidence: a colleague in the press office whom I overheard saying on more than one occasion: \"Don't you think Bridget looks just like the girl from Jerry Maguire?\" I quietly explained that there was a very good reason for that and hissed at her to shut up. She hadn't for a moment thought that it was her - what on earth would she be doing photocopying in Victoria? </p> <p>So convincing was Ren\u00e9e's act that, after one meeting at which she had made some valuable contributions, our deputy publisher, Maria Rejt, no less, remarked on how impressive she was and said that we should try to find a job for her if she was serious about getting into publishing. I nodded vigorously, but said I wasn't sure what her plans were. Hmm. Ren\u00e9e helped me at a book launch and went unnoticed by the many journalists also there and attended a packed bookshop reading in Piccadilly, spotted only by an eagle-eyed, yet incredulous, colleague who had been off sick, who told me she had come up in the lift with Ren\u00e9e Zellweger; nothing slips past her. </p> <p>At lunchtime, Ren\u00e9e would be whisked away in a chauffeur-driven car with her voice coach to a smart restaurant for a calorie-laden lunch in her De Niro-esque bid to pile on the pounds. In the meantime, I would grab a salad or a sandwich at my desk and find myself half a stone heavier when she got back, looking as sickeningly tiny as ever. We were both aspiring to the very normal weight about which Bridget Jones complains in the diary, but just approaching it from different ends of the scales. </p> <p>So after three weeks of helping me out, Ren\u00e9e swapped the life of office drudgery to return to her normal life of being a film star. When the news broke several months later that she had worked undercover at Picador, I had the wonderful task of enlightening my blissfully ignorant colleagues as to who Bridget, the rather posh-sounding and gorgeous work-experience person, really was. It was like your best ever \"What I did in the school holidays to the power of 10\". A Mexican wave of jaw-dropping swept through the offices. </p> <p>Ren\u00e9e sent me a thankyou letter and gift after she'd gone and I have seen her a few times since then. She invited me on to the film set one day (where she performed the most wonderful and generous act that one woman can do for another: she introduced me to Colin Firth). She informed me that I had to stick around and be an extra and made sure that I was put somewhere that I would be seen, viz next to Jeffrey Archer, not a spot to which I would usually gravitate. As a result, half my head can be seen for half a nano-second in the launch party scene; not, perhaps, the full Warholian quota of fame, but my mum's quite excited. Ren\u00e9e also got me invited to the royal charity premiere of The Grinch, her erstwhile fianc\u00e9 Jim Carrey's last film, where I sat in tiara-touching proximity to Her Majesty, and all for having graciously allowed a Hollywood superstar to do my filing. And I'm off to the premiere of Bridget Jones' Diary tonight to see the film again - and I would happily watch it another 10 times: it is fantastic and Ren\u00e9e's performance will put paid to any residual xenophobic quibbles people might have about an American playing that sacred role. She is brilliant. </p> <p>Just for the record, I would be more than happy to repeat the whole experience with any other global superstars wishing to brush up on their admin skills - an application from Russell Crowe would be particularly welcome. </p> <p>\u0095 Bridget Jones's Diary is released on April 13.

      "body": "<p>It's a bit rich, isn't it? Europe, home to J\u00f6rg Haider and Jean-Marie Le Pen, scolding us for being the most racist nation of the bunch. Who are the Germans - longtime deniers of citizenship to Turkish gastarbeiten, even those born in the country - to declare our attitude to refugees and asylum seekers the worst in Europe? Where do the French, whose casual harassment of non-whites is noticed by every black traveller across the Channel, get off scolding us? Who made the Danes, with a scarily energetic rightwing of their own, the PC-police of the continent?</p> <p>That would be one way of dealing with the latest European assault on Britain, yesterday's report from the Council of Europe diagnosing a \"particularly acute\" form of racism here. We could protest that we're no worse than everyone else. Or we might slay the messenger, noting that the council is a glorified talking shop unrelated to the European Union, whose reports are usually consigned to the filing cabinet of history. We might tease the council's investigators, who came here nearly a year ago for a grand total of four days.</p> <p>All those lines of attack are open, and every one of them was taken by politician and pundit alike yesterday. But there is another, less predictable response: we can listen. We can pause for a second and see ourselves the way our neighbours see us. We may be in for an unpleasant surprise.</p> <p>So we might listen to the council's claim that we tend to think of economic migrants not as people seeking a better life - which is admirable - but as parasites and \"criminals trying to sneak into our country\". We might consider, and not dismiss, the EU's racism and xenophobia monitoring unit in Vienna, which last month ranked Britain, of all the 15 member states, as the nation most hostile to political refugees.</p> <p>We might decide that, judging by our present form, the Europeans have got us about right. Just last week we had outgoing Tory MPs John Townend and Christopher Gill offer up a double-act of Powellite xenophobia and stale, halitotic bigotry. No sooner had Townend sung the praises of old Enoch, lamenting that \"Commonwealth immigration\" had undermined our \"homogenous Anglo-Saxon society,\" than Gill was backing him up. Rising numbers of asylum seekers were causing a \"rats in a bucket syndrome\", diluting our national character. \"If you pour enough water on a double scotch,\" he said, \"it ceases to taste like whisky.\"</p> <p>Since neither of these men were denied the Conservative whip in the Commons, we can fairly conclude that William Hague sees no great contradiction between their views and parliamentary service for his party. And why should he? Did not Hague authorise a leaflet for last year's local elections warning of \"bogus asylum seekers... flooding\" our shores? Did he not raise the alarm recently about Britain becoming a \"foreign land\"?</p> <p>So maybe the Euro-inspectors were not so wrong about us after all. But there is a juicier irony here, juicier even than the notion of a continent which houses the Freedom party and the Front Nationale ordering us to clean up our act. It is that, after years of putting up with British Euroscepticism, Europe is finally getting its own back.</p> <p>Call it Britoscepticism. From the European heads of government furious with a British agriculture which has, once again, infected the continent with disease, to a foreign press that has branded our country Plague Island, our neighbours seem set to make Eurosceptic dreams come true. The British right-wing always longed for Britain to break from the continent; now, apparently, the continent wants shot of us.</p> <p>It's not just the headlines announcing the Katastrophe of the Animalisches Inferno - though medieval images of pyres and burning flesh have fattened up foreign news bulletins for a month and half now. Our neighbours have connected our latest crisis, over foot and mouth, with a deeper malaise.</p> <p>We are, they say, the \"sick man of Europe,\" the \"septic isle\".

      "bodyText": "It's a bit rich, isn't it? Europe, home to J\u00f6rg Haider and Jean-Marie Le Pen, scolding us for being the most racist nation of the bunch. Who are the Germans - longtime deniers of citizenship to Turkish gastarbeiten, even those born in the country - to declare our attitude to refugees and asylum seekers the worst in Europe? Where do the French, whose casual harassment of non-whites is noticed by every black traveller across the Channel, get off scolding us? Who made the Danes, with a scarily energetic rightwing of their own, the PC-police of the continent? That would be one way of dealing with the latest European assault on Britain, yesterday's report from the Council of Europe diagnosing a \"particularly acute\" form of racism here. We could protest that we're no worse than everyone else. Or we might slay the messenger, noting that the council is a glorified talking shop unrelated to the European Union, whose reports are usually consigned to the filing cabinet of history. We might tease the council's investigators, who came here nearly a year ago for a grand total of four days. All those lines of attack are open, and every one of them was taken by politician and pundit alike yesterday. But there is another, less predictable response: we can listen. We can pause for a second and see ourselves the way our neighbours see us. We may be in for an unpleasant surprise. So we might listen to the council's claim that we tend to think of economic migrants not as people seeking a better life - which is admirable - but as parasites and \"criminals trying to sneak into our country\". We might consider, and not dismiss, the EU's racism and xenophobia monitoring unit in Vienna, which last month ranked Britain, of all the 15 member states, as the nation most hostile to political refugees. We might decide that, judging by our present form, the Europeans have got us about right. Just last week we had outgoing Tory MPs John Townend and Christopher Gill offer up a double-act of Powellite xenophobia and stale, halitotic bigotry. No sooner had Townend sung the praises of old Enoch, lamenting that \"Commonwealth immigration\" had undermined our \"homogenous Anglo-Saxon society,\" than Gill was backing him up. Rising numbers of asylum seekers were causing a \"rats in a bucket syndrome\", diluting our national character. \"If you pour enough water on a double scotch,\" he said, \"it ceases to taste like whisky.\" Since neither of these men were denied the Conservative whip in the Commons, we can fairly conclude that William Hague sees no great contradiction between their views and parliamentary service for his party. And why should he? Did not Hague authorise a leaflet for last year's local elections warning of \"bogus asylum seekers... flooding\" our shores? Did he not raise the alarm recently about Britain becoming a \"foreign land\"? So maybe the Euro-inspectors were not so wrong about us after all. But there is a juicier irony here, juicier even than the notion of a continent which houses the Freedom party and the Front Nationale ordering us to clean up our act. It is that, after years of putting up with British Euroscepticism, Europe is finally getting its own back. Call it Britoscepticism. From the European heads of government furious with a British agriculture which has, once again, infected the continent with disease, to a foreign press that has branded our country Plague Island, our neighbours seem set to make Eurosceptic dreams come true. The British right-wing always longed for Britain to break from the continent; now, apparently, the continent wants shot of us. It's not just the headlines announcing the Katastrophe of the Animalisches Inferno - though medieval images of pyres and burning flesh have fattened up foreign news bulletins for a month and half now. Our neighbours have connected our latest crisis, over foot and mouth, with a deeper malaise. We are, they say, the \"sick man of Europe,\" the \"septic isle\". For them, foot and mouth is not an isolated, freakish episode but part of a continuum - with BSE the defining event. It is because of mad cow disease, which did have lethal implications for humans, that foreigners have assumed the worst about F&amp;M - even thought the worst damage F&amp;M might inflict on a person would be a cold sore. It's no wonder that NBC News warns Americans of \"the killer disease now stalking Britain - and how we can stop it coming here\". When it comes to food safety, we are not trusted: we have previous. But the problem is deeper still. Foreign observers are linking foot and mouth not only with our agricultural plight, but with the very way we function as a society. Italy's L'Espresso cited our stubborn rates of poverty, the Hatfield rail disaster and the Real IRA's ongoing campaign of bombing, as well as the animal epidemics, as proof that Britain was a nation under a \"curse\". Doubtless they will now be adding the return of tuberculosis, disclosed yesterday, to their list. Thomas Keilinger of Germany's Die Welt writes of the parlous state of our public services, particularly the hospitals and railways. One despatch announced that Britain is \"slowly disappearing in the mire of the real-existing chaos\". Keilinger has told his readers of our lack of patriotism, the vacuity of the dome, the winter floods and our appalling weather. Germans are Anglophiles, he says, but they need to temper their fondness with the truth about this country. \"I think we felt that, after Thatcherism, Britain was a shining example of America-style, go-getting entrepreneurial savvy.

      "bodyText": "China's apparent determination to exploit the US spy plane affair threatens to turn a relatively minor incident into a definitive event in relations between the two countries. Instead of returning the 24 crew of the EP-3 spy plane, and the plane itself, China's President Jiang Zemin has chosen to demand a public apology and an end to US airborne surveillance of his country's coastline. The Beijing foreign ministry has even gone so far as to threaten, obliquely, that the crew could be put on trial and \"punished\". These demands and threats are politically unacceptable to the Bush administration. The Chinese must know that. But by upping the ante, they may be hoping to win concessions in other areas. One such \"concession\" would be a delay in, or even the scrapping of, new US arms sales to Taiwan. A decision on the sales is due this month and China has been lobbying furiously against the plan. Another \"concession\" might, for example, be private US agreement not to press for a censure of China at the current meeting of the UN human rights commission in Geneva. Perhaps Beijing believes it can use its moral advantage after the Hainan incident to influence negotiations on the terms of its entry into the World Trade Organisation. And perhaps its military leaders see the affair as an ideal opportunity to test the mettle of America's new president while demonstrating the government's resolve to nationalist Chinese public opinion. This Chinese approach is akin to a chess game. Some pieces move forward, some move back. Some are sacrificed for bigger gains elsewhere. Unfortunately, Bush is not known as a chess player. He's from Texas. The game he knows is poker. In that kind of contest, a player raises the stakes, then raises them again, until an opponent either gives up or goes bust. In other words, China runs a big risk of over-reaching itself in the aftermath of the Hainan affair. Mr Bush is still an unknown quantity. And his reaction could be simply to call China's bluff by escalating the confrontation. US responses could range from a downgrading of diplomatic ties and the cancellation of Bush's scheduled visit to China this autumn to bilateral trade sanctions and an increased military presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Given the growing anger in the Republican-led Congress, the US might expedite rather than delay arms transfers to Taiwan if China continues to refuse to send the plane and its crew home. In other words, China's subtle and not so subtle gameplan may result in the very opposite result to that which it intends. Remember that Bush already has a record of taking tough decisions swiftly: Iraq discovered that in February when he suddenly launched new bombing attacks. The Europeans and others discovered it too when he unexpectedly scrapped the Kyoto accord on global warming last month. But even if China succeeds to a degree in humiliating Bush and forcing concessions, it may come to regret its triumph in time. A fierce debate was raging in Washington over China policy before the Hainan incident blew up. Hawks such as the vice-president, Dick Cheney, and the Pentagon's Donald Rumsfeld want to take a much more robust approach than that espoused by the Clinton administration. The secretary of state, Colin Powell, and others advocate a more conciliatory line, stressing engagement rather than confrontation. A number of bilateral disputes, ranging from the US's national missile defence plans and its concerns over Beijing's role in weapons proliferation to China's detention of US-linked academics and its assistance to Iraq, have already demonstrated how great is the potential for a real downward dip in relations. A US \"defeat\" over Hainan could prove to be a defeat for Powell, too, giving the advantage to the hawks. Thus the lasting legacy of Hainan, if Beijing is not careful, could be a definitive, permanent tilt by the new US administration towards a much tougher policy on China on a whole range of fronts. But as Bush studies his cards, he surely knows he must be very careful. The US does not need a big new confrontation over Taiwan, for instance. In 1995-96, China fired missiles over the Taiwan Strait, forcing Bill Clinton to send to carrier-led naval battlegroups to the area. Nor would US public opinion be impressed by a president who became embroiled in a menacing standoff with Beijing within three months of taking office. Questions would be asked about his judgment and competence as commander-in-chief. Another big consideration is US security and commercial interests in the Asia-Pacific region as a whole. The grounded US spy plane was based in Okinawa, an uncomfortable reminder for the Japanese of the way their country can be compromised by US actions. The US military presence in Japan is already controversial. Japan has its own difficult bilateral issues with China. A US confrontation with China could thus have a complicating, negative impact on US links with Tokyo - for which the Japanese would blame the Americans. Much the same argument goes for South Korea, where the US also maintains a large military presence. Recent Bush statements on President Kim's \"sunshine policy\" of detente with Chinese-backed North Korea have been seen as less than totally helpful. More strains could develop with Seoul, too. And then there is the unavoidable fact that the shipping lanes of the South China Sea are of great commercial importance to the US in terms of its trade and oil supplies. Continuing or escalating tension in the area could hit the US economy - as the Hainan-related selloff on Wall Street showed this week. In short, both the US and China have very good reasons for not letting the Hainan affair get out of hand. Whether they manage to do that depends to a large extent on how good Bush is at chess and how good Jiang is at poker.

Head of news Sean Rayment, news editor Alan Qualtrough and number three Phillip Derbyshire have all resigned, leaving Daniel Townend as the only remaining staff member. It is not believed that any of the three have jobs to go to, although all are said to be in negotiations with other newspapers and want to stay in journalism. Mr Derbyshire, who was not available for comment, has worked for the Express for 18 years. The journalists are among a number of Express staff who have opted to take voluntary redundancy from the paper following the announcement by Richard Desmond that he planned to make 145 staff redundant. Last week it emerged that two of the Express and the Sunday Express's most senior business journalists, Patrick Hosking and Patrick Tooher, were in negotiations to leave the paper. And the paper's deputy showbusiness editor, Neil Michael, is also taking voluntary redundancy. Today it also emerged that the newsdesk has lost its secretary - the paper's new recruit, photographer Jason Fraser, seconded her for his own office.

There were some notable exceptions, mainly in the big London and metropolitan teaching hospitals, but most were nowhere near as powerful as image would have us believe. The title is also evocative of a demeaning role, with the woman at the pinnacle of nursing portrayed as a harridan or battleaxe, striking fear into her minions. This is certainly bad news as nursing seeks to recruit from a wider pool, including increased numbers of men, who will find this distinctively sexist title very negative. For a so-called \"modernising\" party, it is curious that Labour has harked back to some loaded and questionable terminology to find solutions for the NHS of today. \u0095 Ray Rowden is honorary visiting professor of nursing at University of York and a Labour Party member",

Many had increased responsibilities within the family and were anxious not to burden the remaining parent with their own worries, leaving them isolated to cope with their own complex feelings.</p> <p>Young people were particularly aware of the stigma associated with having a relative in prison, were often anxious to keep it secret, and lived in fear of the consequences of people finding out.

The Scottish prison service should make visits more child-friendly, arrange extra visits for young people and make access easier through cheaper telephone calls or by introducing email links.</p> <p>Police should ensure that an officer is responsible for looking after children and young people at the time of arrest, ensure they are accompanied, and have all the information they need to help them understand what is happening.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the SFPF itself should develop a schools information and training programme to raise awareness of the effects of the imprisonment of a relative on young people and their need for special support.</p> <p>Kate Philbrick, vice-convenor of the SFPF, said: \"We need to get social work, education and criminal justice agencies to look at their processes and the lack of support for teenagers in this vulnerable position. The early experiences, such as arrest and trial, can be as crucial as the imprisonment itself, and can have a life-changing effect.\"</p> <p>Stewart Asquith, professor of social policy at Glasgow University, said there was a danger that teenagers might feel that they themselves were being punished in some way for the behaviour of their imprisoned parent or relative.</p> <p>\"Unless the needs of these young people are addressed ... they will continue to feel that they are being punished and they will carry with them a legacy into adulthood which puts them at further risk,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Help with coping with the effects of imprisonment of a parent or other key figure, and ensuring that they maintain contact with them when they are in prison, has to be provided to teenagers as of right, not as some form of charity.\"</p> <p>Bernadette Monaghan, senior manager of criminal justice charity Safeguarding Communities and Reducing Offending (Sacro) in Scotland, said that people who were able to maintain relationships with their family while in prison were much less likely to reoffend.</p> <p>\"A lot of work has been done to improve visiting facilities, particularly in relation to young children, but up until now nothing has been done for teenagers. Maybe it is easier to look at young children and their needs. When it comes to teenagers there doesn't seem to be the support they can tap into,\" she said.</p> <p>The Scottish prison service said it placed great importance on maintaining family links. \"These are a key element in the rehabilitation process and the prison service has provided a number of initiatives, both itself and with external agencies, to foster greater links,\" said a spokeswoman.</p>",

Police should ensure that an officer is responsible for looking after children and young people at the time of arrest, ensure they are accompanied, and have all the information they need to help them understand what is happening. Meanwhile, the SFPF itself should develop a schools information and training programme to raise awareness of the effects of the imprisonment of a relative on young people and their need for special support. Kate Philbrick, vice-convenor of the SFPF, said: \"We need to get social work, education and criminal justice agencies to look at their processes and the lack of support for teenagers in this vulnerable position. The early experiences, such as arrest and trial, can be as crucial as the imprisonment itself, and can have a life-changing effect.\" Stewart Asquith, professor of social policy at Glasgow University, said there was a danger that teenagers might feel that they themselves were being punished in some way for the behaviour of their imprisoned parent or relative. \"Unless the needs of these young people are addressed ... they will continue to feel that they are being punished and they will carry with them a legacy into adulthood which puts them at further risk,\" he said. \"Help with coping with the effects of imprisonment of a parent or other key figure, and ensuring that they maintain contact with them when they are in prison, has to be provided to teenagers as of right, not as some form of charity.\" Bernadette Monaghan, senior manager of criminal justice charity Safeguarding Communities and Reducing Offending (Sacro) in Scotland, said that people who were able to maintain relationships with their family while in prison were much less likely to reoffend. \"A lot of work has been done to improve visiting facilities, particularly in relation to young children, but up until now nothing has been done for teenagers. Maybe it is easier to look at young children and their needs. When it comes to teenagers there doesn't seem to be the support they can tap into,\" she said. The Scottish prison service said it placed great importance on maintaining family links. \"These are a key element in the rehabilitation process and the prison service has provided a number of initiatives, both itself and with external agencies, to foster greater links,\" said a spokeswoman.",

      "bodyText": "The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, today said it was not \"realistic\" for the Chinese to expect an apology from the US over its spy plane. Speaking before a trip to Belgrade, Mr Cook said China should return the aircraft and its 24-member crew to resolve the dispute as quickly as possible. The US navy EP-3 surveillance plane was forced to make an emergency landing on Hainan Island, China, after a mid-air collision with the Chinese jet that was tracking it. The Chinese fighter crashed into the sea and its pilot is missing. \"The sooner that is resolved, the easier it will be to tackle the questions that arise from this,\" Mr Cook said. The Chinese president, Jiang Zemin, has, however, reiterated his calls for an apology from Washington. He believes the US is responsible for the incident and has called for an end to surveillance flights off China's coast. \"The United States should do something favourable to the smooth development of China-US relations, rather than make remarks that confuse right and wrong, and are harmful to the relations,\" he said. The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, refused. \"We did not do anything wrong,\" he said. \"Our aeroplane was in international airspace, an accident took place and the pilot, in order to save 24 lives, including his own, under circumstances we now have determined must have been hair raising, safely got that plane on the ground.\" George Bush, the US president, said he wanted to give China time to respond to prevent the stalemate from escalating into a full blown crisis. But he said a grace period was quickly expiring. The European Union added its voice to international demands for a quick end to the crisis. \"There [is] a worrisome escalation process going on,\" said Goeran Persson, the Swedish prime minister. Sweden is the current holder of the EU presidency. US diplomats were today allowed to see the crew again. They are planning a long stay on Hainan Island, a popular tourist destination, despite no indication that they will be able to make further visits. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, said he did not know when the crew would be released. He said their fate would depend on an investigation. State television has broadcast comments by ordinary people expressing their anger over the incident. They stick closely to the official account blaming the American pilot but urge viewers to stick to their normal work and study routines - apparently to discourage mass protests such as those that followed America's accidental bombing of China's Belgrade embassy in the Kosovo conflict. But certain to add to the strain, a US-based Chinese political scientist, Gao Zhan, whose detention caused a diplomatic uproar with Washington has been formally arrested on spying charges, a human rights group reported.

Trevor Beattie has created a new campaign for free with the help of comedian Eddie Izzard. More used to ruffling the feathers of middle England, Beattie is turning his attentions to rattling governments with poor human rights records. To celebrate its 40th birthday this year Amnesty is launching a campaign called \"We know where you live\". The linchpin of the campaign will be a comedy benefit night at Wembley Arena on June 3 hosted by Izzard. The event and campaign surrounding it will be branded \"We know where you live\", referring to Amnesty and its supporters knowing where to find the perpetrators of abuse. Mr Beattie, who came up with the name of the campaign with Izzard, has created a newspaper, poster and postcard campaign that will break at the end of this week. A giant-sized poster will be revealed in London and buses sporting the slogan and painted black are already in circulation. The campaign has been created free of charge by Mr Beattie's advertising agency TBWA London. It is the first time the agency has worked for Amnesty. TBWA London was approached by Mark Borkowski PR, which has been appointed by Amnesty to work on all of its 40th birthday celebration projects. The campaign's website also kicks off Amnesty's move in to online campaigning, promoting six cases including comedians jailed in Myanmar, formerly Burma, and a transvestite murdered in Argentina.

To enter, first go to <a href=\"http://www.bol.com\" target=\"_NEW&quot;\">www.bol.com</a> to read a new story by Wilson and discover her tips for aspiring writers. Entrants must be under 15 at the competition's closing date (May 11), and the story should be a maximum of 750 words in length; all other details and conditions can be found at the BOL homepage. The winning story will be published not only in Guardian Parents and at BOL, but also in Jacqueline Wilson's next book of stories! </p> <p><strong>Rattletrap Car</strong><br>Phyllis Root, illustrated by Jill Barton<br>Walker<br>\u00a39.99<br>CultureShop price: \u00a37.99 </p> <p> This book has got to be an instant classic. The illustrations are big, bright, expressive and have a wide-eyed appeal, and Phyllis Root's story combines ingenuity with repetition of the lumpety-bumpety, clinkety-clankety, bing-bang-pop variety that babies and toddlers adore. </p> <p>It tells the story of a dad and three children who, one hot summer's day, set out for the lake in their boneshaker of a car. They take with them a beach ball, surfboard, wind-up paddle-wheel boat, a thermos of razzleberry dazzleberry snazzleberry fizz and some chocolate marshmallow fudge delight, which all come into their own as the car starts to fall apart. This is a book touched by exhilarating summer madness, but which also recognises that sometimes it is children, not adults, who have the answers. </p> <p><strong>Don't Make Me Laugh</strong><br>James Stevenson<br>Red Fox<br>\u00a34.99</p> <p>This innovative picture book is a little miracle. It turned a cross, crying five-year-old into a bundle of giggles. It works like a game. There are just three rules: first, you must not laugh when reading this book; second, you must not even smile; finally, you mustn't do anything that you are told not to do. If you do break the rules - which you undoubtedly will - you must go back to the very front of the book again. </p> <p>In charge of the book and its reader are Mr Frimdimpny, a very stern crocodile. Mr Frimdimpny tells stories that are guaranteed to make any five- or six-year-old laugh. In a clever twist he breaks his own rules and ends up being sent to the front of his own book. Provided that the adult joins in the spirit of the thing, this is a lot of really silly fun for all the family. </p> <p><strong>The Cat Mummy</strong><br>Jacqueline Wilson<br>Doubleday<br>\u00a310.99<br>CultureShop price: \u00a37.99 </p> <p>Verity's mum is dead and her granny, granddad and dad never, ever mention her mother. Verity takes emotional refuge with her mum's old cat Mabel, who is now on her last legs. But then Mabel dies, and Verity, who is studying the Ancient Egyptians, has an idea. It's the kind of idea that grown-ups would find weird but which seems perfectly sensible when you are young, emotionally vulnerable and facing up to death in a family that can't deal openly with bereavement. </p> <p>Wilson gives an extraordinarily truthful child's-eye view of the world. This slight novel, an accessible read for three-to-fives, raises a subject that most fiction for this age group still shies away from. An excellent book, but one you need to know that your child is reading so you can deal with the questions it raises openly. </p> <p><strong>True Believer</strong><br>Virginia Euwer Wolff<br>Faber<br>\u00a34.99 </p> <p> This follow-up to Make Lemonade is a rare thing: a compulsively good read but also a great piece of lyric writing. Don't be put off by the fact that it looks like freeform poetry - it is actually liberating. From the first line you are plunged up to your neck into the story of LaVaughn, whose babysitting saga featured in Make Lemonade, and who now, at 15, is facing greater dilemmas in her life as adulthood beckons. </p> <p>The writing is diamond-sharp, so that a gritty social-realist story becomes touched with poetry. The characterisations are intricate and the emotions feel so raw and true that even as an adult it makes you remember what it was like to be 15 again and so full of expectation, hope and the torment of being let down by those things and people that you counted on. </p> <p> <strong> Shh! Don't Tell Mr Wolf</strong><br>Colin McNaughton<br>Collins<br>\u00a35.99<br>CultureShop price: \u00a33.99 </p> <p>Small children love familiarity, and McNaughton's comic series about the adventures of the ever-hungry and sneaky Mr Wolf and the lovable Preston Pig now boasts a number of titles. </p> <p>This latest instalment is a lift-the-flap book that will appeal to the very young as Mr Wolf (not a wolf of great brain) stalks his dinner (Preston Pig) all over the house. Of course, dinner always escapes and, in the battle of wits, Mr Wolf fares rather badly - to such an extent that he ends up resembling a walking stretcher case. </p> <p>This is like Tom and Jerry in book form: the pleasure comes not from knowing what will happen - Mr Wolf will always go hungry - but from how it comes about. The flaps are ingenious, although they may not stand up to repeated use, and the humour is always deliciously subversive. </p> <p> <strong>The Man Who Wore All His Clothes</strong><br>Allan Ahlberg<br>Walker<br>\u00a39.99 <br>CultureShop price: \u00a37.99</p> <p> The number of six- and seven-year-olds hooked on adult TV soaps is distressingly high, but now they have their own novelette-style soap opera in the shape of the Gaskitts, a very ordinary family who lead extraordinary lives, just as we all do. </p> <p>The first in what will be a series, this picture-heavy book, with its bold, natty illustrations, chronicles the domestic life of the Gaskitts. It is a life that is a little bit off the wall - from the car radio that gets everything topsy-turvy, to the cat that goes round to his friends' place to watch weepy films in the afternoon, to the bank robber who hijacks Mrs Gaskitt's taxi. </p> <p>Ahlberg builds up his story like a zany game of consequences, leading to an ending that quite logically explains why Mr Gaskitt wears all his clothes to work. A lovely book for new readers. </p> <p> <strong> Caught on a Train</strong><br>Carlo Gebler<br>Egmont<br>\u00a34.99 </p> <p> This bewitching piece of storytelling is the kind of book that a confident 10- or 11-year-old could read but would return to when they were teenagers or adults. At its heart are three Irish folk tales: Soul Cages, Daniel O'Rourke and Bewitched Butter, which can also be found in WB Yeats's anthology of Irish tales. Gebler makes these tales seem new-minted, but it is the way that he frames them that is really thrilling as they become part of a storytelling contest between the sinister Mr Clink and two other men, the only first-class passengers on the express train from Dublin to Achill Island one day in 1899. Told through the eyes of Archie, the kitchen boy, Gebler builds up a detailed and atmospheric portrait of an everyday working life suddenly touched by an inexplicable evil. A compulsive read that clutches at your heart and makes you shiver until you remember that it is only a story. </p> <p> <strong> The Damage Done</strong><br>Linda Newbery<br>Scholastic<br>\u00a35.99<br>CultureShop price: \u00a34.99 </p> <p> Kirsty's mother has left home, so the teenager is living with her father, a writer absorbed in his work. Her elder brother has gone to America, leaving her both to look after Dad and to run the riding stable business. It is all too much responsibility for the girl who is part child, part woman, and the news that horses in the area are being attacked adds to the pressure. Then Kirsty meets the mysterious Dally. Is he responsible for the mutilated horses, or the friend Kirsty needs? </p> <p>Newbery tells her story of a young woman's self-discovery with a quiet authority in a book that is always a page-turner but feels measured and adult as it grapples with Kirsty's insecurity. The story and issues - coming to terms with the fact that those you love can let you down, and the need to live your own life, not the one that parents or friends demand - are always entwined, never separate. </p> <p>\u0095 Readers can call the Guardian book ordering service on 0800 3166 102, or send an order with a UK cheque, payable to The Guardian, to Off the Shelf Book Offers, FREEPOST Books, LON3590, London, W3 6BR. 1st Class p&amp;p is \u00a31.99 per order, not per book.</p>",

To enter, first go to www.bol.com to read a new story by Wilson and discover her tips for aspiring writers. Entrants must be under 15 at the competition's closing date (May 11), and the story should be a maximum of 750 words in length; all other details and conditions can be found at the BOL homepage. The winning story will be published not only in Guardian Parents and at BOL, but also in Jacqueline Wilson's next book of stories! Rattletrap Car Phyllis Root, illustrated by Jill Barton Walker \u00a39.99 CultureShop price: \u00a37.99 This book has got to be an instant classic. The illustrations are big, bright, expressive and have a wide-eyed appeal, and Phyllis Root's story combines ingenuity with repetition of the lumpety-bumpety, clinkety-clankety, bing-bang-pop variety that babies and toddlers adore. It tells the story of a dad and three children who, one hot summer's day, set out for the lake in their boneshaker of a car. They take with them a beach ball, surfboard, wind-up paddle-wheel boat, a thermos of razzleberry dazzleberry snazzleberry fizz and some chocolate marshmallow fudge delight, which all come into their own as the car starts to fall apart. This is a book touched by exhilarating summer madness, but which also recognises that sometimes it is children, not adults, who have the answers.

Moments later, Jane bounced out of the bathroom and presented the dark blue line in triumph. Ready or not, we were soon flicking through the dictionary of first names and, with two boys already, struggling to remain gender-neutral. It was a third child we wanted, we told ourselves, and besides, the matter was already out of our control. </p> <p>Having previously suffered an early miscarriage, we knew it was sensible to delay the announcement. But we were expecting a family visit and they would surely guess why Jane had gone teetotal. So we began to tell the world with Jane barely eight weeks pregnant. </p> <p>Parents of more than one child will recognise the syndrome. With the first child, you sit down and work your way through your address book. This time, we casually mentioned it, often halfway through a social occasion: \"Oh, did I tell you that Jane is pregnant again?\" </p> <p>The following week I was away on business. I was shocked when I phoned home to find Jane in tears. Carrying our four-year-old up to bed, she had tripped on a toy and fallen badly. It was an awful moment for both of us: me feeling guilty for being away; Jane upset because she did not want me to think she could not cope on her own. Two weeks later, Jane started to bleed. Without panicking, we consulted our library of parenting books. Bleeding was a common experience, we discovered. We tried to avoid thinking the worst. </p> <p>When the bleeding did not stop a day later and clots started to appear, Jane called our GP. It was the weekend and she was advised to attend the A&amp;E department. We both knew what this meant. While I looked after the kids, Jane spent four hours waiting to be seen. A junior doctor examined her to see whether the mouth of her womb was open, but couldn't tell. Jane was booked in for an ultrasonic scan the following week. </p> <p>We agreed that I would take the day off work to accompany her to the clinic. If it was bad news, they might want her to have a scrape, we thought. Jane would need me to drive her, pick up the kids and generally \"take over\" while she recovered. </p> <p>In truth, it was not a good time for me to be off work. But at the back of my mind was a memory of how, when Jane had her first miscarriage, I had failed to support her. Like the average guy, an early miscarriage had seemed to me little more serious than a late period. That was until Jane came back from the hospital, accused me of not giving a damn and cried for a week. This time I wanted to be there for her. </p> <p>Leaving the hospital, we decided on a bit of retail therapy to lift our depression. Later, with a car full of unplanned purchases, I asked Jane if she would mind my going to the office. She stared at me, incredulous. Yes, she did mind. We had both been to the same clinic and heard the same advice. Somehow, I came out thinking there was still a chance of life; Jane came out convinced that she was carrying a dead baby. I realised Jane was right. I finally put work out of my mind. That night, Jane enjoyed her first drink in a month. </p> <p>Jane's bleeding became heavier and the clots larger. But she was back to her usual self. Together we faced the task of explaining our situation to friends. Who had we told? What should we say? Did I tell you Jane was pregnant? No? Well now she isn't. </p> <p>Later that week, I came home from work and Jane warned me not to go into the bathroom. Usually this would mean the boys had destroyed one of my DIY efforts. I stepped into the room. Nothing could have prepared me for what I found. A tiny foetus, no bigger than my thumb, lay on a bloodied sanitary towel. I held it up and examined it closely, unable to believe that its features could be so distinct. </p> <p>Suddenly, I was choked with tears. It was so unspeakably sad, that this little person had barely lived before it was dead. Jane was amazed by my reaction. She had done her grieving on the day of the scan. It took for me to see what I had lost. </p> <p>The problem then became a practical one: what to do with the remains of our child. It was like being in a Joe Orton play. The idea of flushing it down the lavatory was unthinkable. Jane favoured a burial in the garden, but I objected on the grounds that either I or some future owner would disturb its resting place. So we decided upon cremation. </p> <p>With our boys tucked up in bed, on a cold winter's night, we put the tiny body on a bed of tissue in a cardboard cufflinks box, doused it with white spirit and set it alight on the upturned lid of a metal dustbin. It burned for a very long time. We sat and watched, swigging from a flask of brandy, and wept our final tears. Then we scattered the ashes in our flowerbed. </p> <p>In the weeks that followed, we tried to talk about our experience with friends. I was not surprised to find that male friends were generally uncomprehending, even those who were parents. For many men, the idea of miscarriage is permanently associated with \"lucky escapes\". But some female friends found it equally difficult to offer sympathy. Just when Jane thought she was starting to put the experience behind her, one of her girlfriends asked whether she thought it possible that she \"only miscarried the girl babies\". </p> <p>Miscarriage is one of society's taboos, we discovered. Only those who have been through it understand. When someone asks Jane whether her second pregnancy was easier than her first, I can't always predict how she will answer.</p>",

Celebrities have miscarriages just like the rest of us; last month it was Nicole Kidman, but there were Lauren Booth, Martine McCutcheon, Gillian Taylforth and Caroline Quentin before her. </p> <p>Ask your friends and you'll find that many of them have had at least one miscarriage. There are no rules. Because it is so commonplace, the assumption is that it is something you should get over quickly and not make too much of a fuss about. But for many women - even those who go on to have children - it isn't that easy. </p> <p>\"I've felt so totally lost after all of mine and just so alone,\" says Laura. \"I didn't know what to do with all of these feelings. Miscarriage is so anonymous. It's hard to grieve for someone you've never met or known. </p> <p>\"You don't have a grave to go to. You don't have any physical reminders that there was a baby there at all. It's the lack of acknowledgment. The baby doesn't even have a legal identity. There's no birth or death certificate.\" </p> <p>And how long are you allowed to feel sad? If the miscarriage happens in the early weeks of pregnancy, not long. It was just a late period, really - social convention dictates that you can't get too upset about that. If it happens past the 12-week watershed, the point at which most people tell friends and family about a pregnancy, you're allowed to grieve a little longer, but your loss is soon forgotten by others. </p> <p>A recent report in the British Journal of Medical Psychology concluded that the grief for both partners following a miscarriage is often underestimated - particularly as far as men are concerned, since it is felt that the father has had little opportunity to \"bond\" with the unborn child. This chimes with the findings of an Australian survey on the effect of miscarriage. Kim Conway, who carried out the study with Professor Graeme Russell at Macquairie University, Sydney, said: \"The prevailing view both in the health and lay communities has been that the trauma of miscarriage is not great. It entails a short visit to hospital, full recovery and the expectation of a successful pregnancy afterwards.\" </p> <p>Laura Gliddon went on to have two successful pregnancies, but it did not lessen her grief for the ones she had lost. Her marriage broke down. \"My friends were all there for me at the time, but they don't mention it now,\" she says. 'They just don't acknowledge it. But for me it goes on. I don't think it's something you get over. I think it's something you get through.\" </p> <p>At the remembrance services Laura Gliddon attends for the children she feels she lost, there is often standing room only. There are some men there, but it's mainly women - including one elderly lady who lost her baby back in the 1930s. She still remembers 70 years on. </p> <p>Likewise Sarah Williams, who had a miscarriage after three years of trying to get pregnant. She and her husband had not told anyone about the pregnancy. After so much disappointment, she wanted to be as sure as she could that all was well; they planned to tell everyone after 12 weeks.

Lack of birth control may have been a factor, infant mortality another, but by and large, poor working people had lots of children for economic reasons. For, in the days before the welfare state, who was going to support you in old age, if not your sons and daughters? </p> <p>The demographics of postwar affluence led to a decline in large families, and we have all come to accept the received wisdom that prosperity means either small families or no kids at all. But while everyone knows the birth rate is falling (the average woman now has just 1.7 offspring) and the number of lone parents increasing, there are some other interesting trends concealed within our national statistics. </p> <p>The latest figures from the Office of National Statistics show that women in England and Wales now give birth to fewer children than at any time since 1977. But it emerges that from 1989 to 1999, proportionately more of the children being born each year were the third in their family. In other words, while the overall birth rate is down, many of those who do give birth are choosing to have larger families. </p> <p>Wendy Holden is one of those women. When she became pregnant, she was not alone. In her village of Staverton, Northants, population only 500 people, she can name 10 neighbours who also gave birth last year. And for four of those families, like Holden's, it was child number three. \"It's quite a phenomenon,\" she says. \"There seem to be so many people having bigger families here.\" </p> <p>But it's not just happening in Staverton. From 1989 to 1999, while total births fell by 10%, the number of third children born increased, from 16% of all births to 18%. It was the only category to show a significant rise; the number of second babies, for instance, fell by just over 1%. </p> <p>\"What this research suggests is that there is a polarisation between women having no baby or just one and larger families,\" says Maria Iacovou of the Institute for Social and Economic Research. \"Given the cost of childcare, it's likely that women having more children are from affluent families.\" </p> <p>A closer look at the figures reveals clear social differences. Essentially, women in social classes IIIM, IV and V (manual skilled, partly skilled and unskilled) are having smaller families. There has been a dramatic fall - 43% - in the number of children with at least one older sibling being born to the manually skilled. The relative numbers of second children and upwards born to the top social classes have fallen too, though the drop has not been as remarkable (9% over the past 10 years). What is significant is that just one category has shown a substantial increase - women in their 30s in social classes I and II. In the last 10 years, the number of these women having a third child has gone up 8%. </p> <p>There are some caveats - the figures above are for married women only, for example - but the new trends come as no surprise to Iacovou. \"People of modest means would tend to stop at two children,\" she says. </p> <p>Holden is a perfect example of the statistics. Aged 37, she is university-educated and worked in senior middle management until her second son, Timothy, now three, was born. Her oldest, Matthew, is five, while Zo\u00eb was born last October. \"I know a lot of people who aren't having children and a lot who are single, so we're keeping up the average,\" says her husband, Peter Williams, a manufacturing manager. \"We're lucky because we could afford to have a third. Our situation is probably representative of the village; all these third children reflect the economics of Staverton.\" </p> <p>David Coleman, reader in demography at Oxford University, agrees. \"The better-off are able to afford larger families while they continue with their careers. They're less affected by the costs of having children.\" </p> <p>Holden and Williams did not plan on three. \"I've spoken to many people who had babies later in life, and like them, I've been surprised at how lovely it is to raise a family,\" says Holden. </p> <p>Williams, who has a brother seven years his junior, says he was keen for his children to have siblings they could play with. Holden, the oldest of three, admits that her experience may have encouraged her desire to have a third. Three, she says, is a \"family unit\". </p> <p>It seems to be a widespread belief. \"In due course,\" says Coleman, \"having three children may become even more common, if prosperity increases and is evenly distributed.\" </p> <p>Peter and Julia Barron are both the youngest of three. \"Although we never really discussed it, we knew that once we had two, we wanted a third,\" says Peter, father of baby Luke, Martha, two, and George, three. \"Deep down, that's probably because of our own experiences. It wasn't planned, but we're very happy with three.\" </p> <p>Like Holden and Williams, Peter, 38, from London, says finances were not particularly a consideration in the decision to have a bigger family. \"Space is more important. We didn't think of the expense of having three, and now we've gone and done it.\" </p> <p>He knows a number of people with larger families. \"I've got two colleagues with four and various others with three,\" he says. \"I suppose it's to do with affluence. Anyway, the number of people carriers around suggests that people are having more children.\" </p> <p>But his wife's experience is the opposite. \"Most women I know are still working,\" says Julia, 36. \"That makes three pretty much impossible. You have one, maybe two, but your career is totally broken by three.\" </p> <p>\"I decided to take a few years out from working after Martha,\" she adds. \"I went back quickly after George and it was great, but I wasn't spending that much time with him. It's harder to do that with two and, as I'm no good at juggling, I decided to take time off. Having three children and going back to work would require a phenomenal amount of childcare.\" </p> <p>To some extent, Barron's experience epitomises the reality of childbearing today. Many women have no children, while others have three. \"In the past there has been a negative association between higher educational status and family size,\" says Coleman. \"Childlessness has been associated with these [more educated] women.\" </p> <p>Both Wendy Holden and Julia Barron say their families are now complete (although both husbands are less definite). \"I'm not going to have another one,\" says Wendy with determination. </p> <p>Barron agrees. \"After two, I felt I had one more in me,\" she says. \"But the last pregnancy was so knackering, that's it.\"</p>",

Researcher Dr Paul Shattock called for urgent action to determine the cause of the alarming increase, which he believes must be caused by a change in environmental influences. Dr Shattock, director of the Autism Research Unit at the University of Sunderland, said that there was no proof that the controversial MMR vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella was responsible. However, he insisted that research into MMR's possible role in causing autism had so far been inadequate and that a study planned by the Medical Research Council would not settle the issue. Many parents blame MMR for their child's autism, but the government and the vast majority of doctors believe the vaccination is safe. Today's study, an interim announcement of a full report to be published later this year, is the result of the analysis of 6,000 people on the Autism Research Unit's database. Dr Shattock said that there were many possible reasons for the increase in autism cases, which was unlikely to be caused simply by changes in diagnostic practice. \"Clearly there is increased awareness and understanding of autism and diagnostic criteria have changed slightly,\" he said. \"But even allowing for this, all over the world there seems to be a big increase in incidence, and we have to look at all the things that have happened in the meantime to see what is likely to be relevant. \"There are many possible reasons.

The two-hour episode, in which John Thaw and Kevin Whately starred as Morse and Lewis for the last time, went out on ITV before Christmas. Now it has been sold to Japanese broadcaster NHK at MipTV by distributor Carlton International, along with 60-minute documentary the Last Morse, which examines the Morse phenomenon. Carlton is also doing good business with the Gerry Anderson library of cult \"supermarionation\" puppet shows. The latest Anderson show to make a comeback is Stingray, which has been sold to New Zealand broadcaster Prime TV. A much newer Carlton children's show, STARStreet, has also proved popular in Cannes, selling to broadcasters in France and Singapore. The 13-part series, which goes out in the UK as part of ITV Saturday morning show SM:TV Live, follows the adventures of pop band allSTARS. Meanwhile, Granada has sealed two production deals with overseas companies. Granada Kids has hooked up with the US children's programming producer JP Kids to co-develop up to four shows a year. Granada and JP Kids will develop children's live-action and animated shows, as well as TV movies aimed at a family audience. Also in Cannes, Granada International has signed a deal with US/Israeli producer AT Media to co-produce a minimum of 30 hours of factual programming a year. The partners have agreed to work on projects such as an historical documentary series called In the Footsteps of Moses and a show based on the real-life heroine who inspired Patricia Cornwall's best-selling crime thrillers.

      "bodyText": "BBC2 documentary strand Storyville is to move to new high-brow digital channel BBC4 and become a weekly feature of the service. Storyville editor Nick Fraser is at the MipTV programming market in Cannes this week looking for foreign material to fill the extra slots. From next year, the number of Storyville slots will go up from around 10 documentaries shown annually on BBC2 to 52, some on the same channel but most on BBC4, according to Mr Fraser. Storyville has showcased some of the best international documentaries around in recent years, including last year's documentary Oscar winner One Day in September. \"I always wanted to have enough space to show a huge variety of the best non-fiction programming,\" said Mr Fraser. \"I've been looking through the archives for some golden oldies, but there will also be a lot of new stuff, including co-productions and pre-purchased documentaries from overseas.\"",

Investors' eyebrows had been raised at the size of the deal, which will see Nokia loaning the cash Orange needs to build its 3G mobile phone networks in France, Germany and the UK. In effect, Nokia is giving Orange money to buy its products. Nokia's shares, however, recovered from a 7% loss yesterday to settle at E25.20 on the Helsinki exchange in Finland this morning - just 0.2% down. Analysts spoke up for the Orange deal, arguing that Nokia will be boosted by equipment orders for the 3G networks, which will provide always-on internet connections, faster transmission speeds and video services to 10m Orange customers. \"Orange is a huge player in Europe. Nokia has a very healthy balance sheet and it is best for it to cement these relationships by providing a bit of vendor finance,\" said Susan Anthony, telecoms equipment analyst at Credit Lyonnais. Ms Anthony added that Nokia will also be well placed to benefit from further expansion of the networks, which should happen as soon as traffic increases. Nokia has also agreed to provide \u00a3315m-worth of 3G network equipment to Hutchison 3G, a new player in the UK mobile phone market. It caused jitters in the markets earlier this week when it announced a similar deal with Mobilcom of Germany, which is part-owned by Orange and has suffered from the negative sentiment sweeping the telecoms sector. But vendor financing is seen as the best way for mobile phone equipment makers to reach their revenue targets and for cash-strapped mobile phone companies to pay for 3G networks. The telecoms sector is awash with debt after European players spent a staggering \u00a397m last year - most of which was borrowed from banks and spent on hugely expensive 3G mobile phone licences. The biggest victims are BT, which owes \u00a330bn, France Telecom, which owes \u00a340bn and Deutsche Telekom, which owes \u00a336bn. Some analysts fear a stream of defaults on loans taken out to pay for these licences, which has sent telecoms operators scurrying to the likes of Nokia for more cash. It is estimated a further \u00a3100bn will have to be spent on 3G networks over the next four years. Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola have a total \u00a390bn available in shareholders' funds.",

      "bodyText": "The chief executive of Trinity Mirror, Philip Graf, has warned that the relationship between New Labour's media relations machine and the Sun newspaper is too close for comfort. He said the relationship \"does not seem a very satisfactory way to do business\". Mr Graf said he had \"a great professional admiration for the Sun\", the top-selling tabloid newspaper owned by his rival, News International. But he said it was extraordinary to see how the Labour party had ignored the cabinet, the parliamentary party and due democratic processes and announced the general election date through a newspaper and the BBC. His reference to the Sun's revelation that the government would be delaying the date of the general election suggested Mr Graf felt the Mirror was not enjoying the same privileges. Rival newspapers claimed this week that the Sun's political editor Trevor Kavanagh had been briefed on the decision to delay the election ahead of the rest of the press and members of Tony Blair's own cabinet. But in the course of a wide-ranging speech about the relationship between the government and the press, Mr Graf dwelled on the relationships between lobby journalists and spin doctors, and newspaper publishers and government. \"It would be hard to deny that Rupert Murdoch's takeover of the Times and the Sunday Times was not helped by his support of the then government,\" Mr Graf said. He added that Neil Kinnock was persuaded to refrain from making a statement condemning Robert Maxwell's planned takeover of Mirror Group in 1984. Mr Graf also praised Mr Blair's chief spin doctor Alastair Campbell for introducing more openness into the lobby system. And he spoke of the new European Human Rights Act, warning that privacy cases brought by celebrities threatened to undermine press freedom by introducing a backdoor privacy law. \"There is already evidence to indicate that the Human Rights Act is being used by courts to restrict what can be reported in criminal proceedings and, at least initially, the courts have been more inclined to restrict press freedom rather than be robust in defence of it,\" he said.

Three prisoners had appealed that denying inmates the vote was in contravention of the Human Rights Act, which the Labour government introduced in 1998. But today two senior judges threw out their claim, agreeing with the 1983 Representation of the People Act that bars convicted prisoners from the electoral roll while they are in prison. Lord Justice Kennedy said the voting franchise was a matter for parliament and \"parliament has taken the view that for the period during which they are in custody convicted prisoners have forfeited their right to have a say in the way the country is governed.\" Lord Justice Kennedy and Mr Justice Garland were unanimous in rejecting the challenge from the three men - Anthony Pearson, serving 10 years for importing drugs; Richard Martinez, serving life after being convicted in 1996 of arson with intent to endanger life; and John Hirst, serving life at Nottingham prison for manslaughter. The judges added that there was a \"broad spectrum\" among democratic societies over whether or not prisoners should have the vote, and the UK \"falls into the middle of the spectrum\". They also rejected a bid from the Edward Fitzgerald QC, who represented two of the inmates, to allow an appeal to the court of appeal. Mr Fitzgerald said: \"It is illegitimate to use disqualification from the vote as punishment.\" He told the judges that even if it were legitimate, the present legislation was arbitrary \"because it punishes imprisonment, rather than offences on any graded scheme\". A spokesman for the Prison Reform Trust, Joe Levenson, which supported today's application, expressed disappointment with the court's ruling, but added: \"This case should mark the start - not the end - of the political and public debate about how our society encourages prisoners to take responsibility. \"Banning prisoners from voting serves no purpose and is a hangover from the 19th century.

      "body": "<p>The United States' decision to abandon the Kyoto agreement and put its own energy requirements above the planet's health has supplied Europe with an unusually rapid means of deciding the worth of George Bush - if indeed we needed one. At any rate, in little less than a week Europeans have concluded that the US government has been captured by an exceptionally irresponsible and foolish man. Bush seems too bad to be true.</p> <p>While we all blinked at his dismissal of Kyoto and the forging ahead with plans for oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Bush attended a dinner in Washington where he sought to relax the White House press corps with a line about water purity. \"As you know, we're studying safe levels for arsenic in drinking water,\" he said. \"To base our decision on sound science, the scientists told us we needed to test the water glasses of about 3,000 people. Thank you for participating.\"</p> <p>What we appear to have in the White House, then, is the American equivalent of Jim Davidson: an unabashed conservative with a historic drink problem and an alluringly toxic sense of humour. But not even Jim would have confused capital punishment with death duties as Bush did a few weeks ago when he declared: \"We understand how unfair the death penalty is.\"</p> <p>We in Europe gape at such faux pas and conclude - unjustly, as it happens - that George Bush is some kind of essential distillation of all US culture and that, therefore, all America is to blame for his presence in the White House. We note that the US constitutes 5% of the world's population but is responsible for a quarter of all mankind's emissions of carbon dioxide. With only the slightest hesitation, it seems, this same nation voted in Bush Mark II, who promised to out-Reagan Reagan and to dismiss world opinion on issues which, in our innocence, we had decided were pretty much orthodoxies for the new century.</p> <p>And then something fascinating happened, something which had long been waiting to happen. All the resentments about American national life - the continued use of the death penalty, the refusal to address guns, the overbearing nature of its entertainment industry, the disinclination to wholeheartedly ratify treaties on landmines, and the International Criminal Court - coalesced into a single charge sheet which damned American society as being arrogant and out of touch with global concerns.</p> <p>The mood has been building for a long time, but the decision to abandon Kyoto crystalised the issue in people's minds. Suddenly Europe is tired of the American dominance in practically every area of life, which is how the French have found themselves a hero in the McDonald's wrecker, Jose Bove.</p> <p>Americans are amazed by the swiftness and unjustness of it all. They really do like to be loved and they feel that Europe gives them scant credit for the era of peace which has been guaranteed by successive American governments since the last war.</p> <p>I have a lot of close American friends, having worked for a US corporation for a good part of the last decade. With one of them I have only to mention the number of teenagers being executed in the US and he shoots back: \"Hey, if it wasn't for us, you'd all be speaking German.\" Then he usually takes another sip of wine and adds: \"Or Russian.\" Less than 50% of this is an ironic evocation of Archie Bunker.</p> <p>Last summer I went out with another friend who edits one of the big news magazines in the US, a very charming anglophiliac Wasp. Unwisely I began to explain the European suspicion of America, listing the usual grievances that now form the charge sheet. He took it for a while then deliberately set down his glass and gazed at its stem, evidently struggling to hold on to his temper. \"The trouble with Europe is that every time you get into trouble you yell across the Atlantic for help. But, when things are good you expect us to listen to your horseshit lectures about the way we run things in the US.\" The point is well made, and indeed Europe's need to carry its own big stick and to sort out its own problems in the Balkans is one of the driving instincts behind the European Defence Force.</p> <p>Americans see Europe as ungrateful but also congenitally inclined to political chaos. This suspicion of Europe stretches back to the hot summer of 1787 when, among others, Benjamin Franklin and George Washington sat down to write the constitution for the 13 states of America. In every sentence, they strove to distinguish the new republic from the oppression and abuse in the old world. That self-conscious creation of a political antithesis was strengthened over the 19th century and into the 20th by the fact that great numbers of people fled Europe's famines, pestilence and persecution for America. Thus the ancestral memory of Europe, albeit hazy, is as a place to escape from. American jokes about Europe dwell on its dodgy, screwed-up, murderous past.</p> <p>Americans may feel cut off from the civilising presence of European culture and dimly hanker after their ethnic roots, especially those who claim Scottish, Irish, Greek and Italian ancestry. But there is also the feeling among many that their not-so-bright kin were the ones left behind to tend the goats. The European cousins may look up and see the Parthenon, the ancient temples of Sicily or the walls of Dubrovnik in their everyday life, but it doesn't substantially change the fact that they are still goatherds. Meanwhile, the American relation boasts a used car lot bigger than the Forum. So what earthly reason can there be to take notice of the European's views about landmines and genetically modified food?</p> <p>Something less than 25% of all Americans have passports and it follows that the American experience of the outside world is extremely limited. While Europeans are exposed to a constant flow of fascinating information about American life, there's no reciprocal interest in the US about Europe, except when we have floods and foot and mouth and atrocities in the Balkans. Then the US takes notice, but this only serves to underscore the impression that life outside the great republic is far from comfortable.</p> <p>William Pfaff, writing in the Los Angeles Times the other day, noted a mistake made by the new secretary of the treasury, Paul O'Neill, who had commented that something had to be done to help the Japanese achieve a higher standard of living. As Pfaff writes: \"In fact, Japan's problem is that its living standards are so high - much higher on average than in the United States - that Japanese consumers can't think of much they want to spend more money on.\"</p> <p>Among my friends in the United States I find a similar frustration with our misapprehensions - the idea, for instance, that every schoolyard is being raked by a 12-year-old with an assault rifle, or that you are quite likely to see a car chase through the streets of Manhattan. In fact, Americans drive much more slowly than Europeans and for the most part lead lives of dull plenty in the suburbs. Except in the big cities, America is astonishingly slow and conservative. HL Mencken, the great journalist of the first half of the century, certainly understood this when he attacked the way Americans refuse to discuss religion: \"The result is that all religions are equally safeguarded against criticism, and that all of them lose vitality. We protect the status quo and so make steady war upon revision and improvement. That is a profoundly clever observation about the US, which is so often mistaken for the jittery crucible of invention. In areas other than commercial enterprise, it has been remarkably slow to challenge the status quo - segregation and gun law - mostly from fear of offending the Bill of Rights and Constitution.</p> <p>While America has a clear narrative to its political history which unrolls with fascinating drama but always with a consistent set of interests and procedures, Europe is evidently prey to more mobile and fitful political passions. In 1925 Mencken saw how the two cultures rubbed each other up the wrong way. Europeans, he wrote, despaired of \"our growing impatience with the free play of ideas, our increasing tendency to reduce all virtues to the single one of conformity, our relentless and all pervading standardisation.\"</p> <p>That still encapsulates the European doubt about the United States of America, and if you add the big issues listed on the charge sheet, you pretty much have it all. George Bush is a product of that deeply conservative strain in America that wars against revision and improvement. In Europe we are brave enough or foolish enough to think that we can revise and improve, which is why the clash occurs. To my mind the division appears deeper than it actually is, and in fact I'd bet my last dollar that we won't throw in our lot with Europe, which many suggest is the logical outcome of the current frustrations with American conservatism. There is one point that everyone is forgetting in the heated debate about Kyoto.

Mr Messier was incensed by comments made by Klaus Esser, former chief executive of Mannesmann, in this morning's Financial Times. \"Following Mr Esser's declarations, Mr Messier has decided to take legal action for defamation against Mr Esser,\" Vivendi said in a brief statement. Mr Esser claimed Mannesmann was forced to accept a takeover bid from UK rival Vodafone in January last year after Mr Messier abruptly abandoned a merger with the German company. Mannesmann, which was desperate to avoid a Vodafone takeover, was clinging to the hope of a Vivendi rescue bid. The German executive described Mr Messier's behaviour as \"indecent\" and \"dishonourable\" and accused the Frenchman of negotiating with Vodafone while engaged in delicate negotiations with Mannesmann. \"I had been discussing things with Mr Messier that could only be discussed in a climate of absolute trust,\" said Mr Esser. Instead of tying up the Mannesmann deal, Mr Messier shocked the mobile phone company by announcing it had established the Vizzavi internet joint venture with Vodafone. Mr Esser claims the Vizzavi deal and Vivendi's subsequent abandonment of merger talks forced him to recommend the Vodafone takeover bid to a reluctant Mannesmann board. Mr Esser also hit out at rumours he accepted the \u00a3109bn bid in exchange for the promise of a \u00a319m redundancy package. The payment is now being investigated by public prosecutors in Germany. \"The whole story is driven by envy and is nothing but a slanderous media coup,\" he said. However, the Vivendi chief executive has hit back at allegations of his duplicity, saying Mr Esser knew he was talking to Vodafone counterpart Chris Gent. \"In an industrial war, as in any war, discussing with both camps is always a delicate exercise. \"Of course Chris Gent and Klaus Esser knew we were talking to both of them,\" said Mr Messier.

Three days after the Countess of Wessex debacle broke, Lord Wakeham has declared the royals were treated just like any other member of the public. In a letter to the Daily Telegraph today, he said: \"The Palace asked for no special favours and would have received none.\" He was stirred into action following Buckingham Palace claims that the News of the World interview with the countess in which she talked about Prince Edward not being gay was arranged \"in conjunction\" with the PCC. Lord Wakeham confirmed the Palace had approached by the PCC two weeks ago when it first emerged that secret recordings had been made by the News of the World. \"I gave them exactly the same advice that the PCC gives countless members of the public - and public figures alike - who approach us every week for help before an article is published,\" Lord Wakeham said. \"I told them there were two courses of action open to them. Either they could wait until the Sunday newspaper in question had published transcripts and complain to us if they thought it breached the newspaper industry code. \"Or they could approach the newspaper direct, in advance of publication, to argue their case and see if some accommodation could be reached.\" He added: \"After that discussion, the decision on the course of action was the Palace's alone.\" The PCC had no \"further role in the marker\". Lord Wakeham's tersely worded letter will be seen as a direct rebuke of the Queen's press secretary Simon Lewis, who reportedly told friends he was advised by the PCC to sanction Sophie Wessex's interview with the News of the World. The interview spectacularly backfired on the newspaper, which is now being seen as the Palace's puppet. Editor Rebekah Wade agreed not to publish the dynamite material obtained by her undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood, who duped the Countess by posing as a sheikh seeking business with her PR firm. She is alleged to have called the wife of the prime minister, Cherie Booth, \"horrid, horrid, horrid\", and described the Queen as \"the old dear\". The damage limitation strategy mounted by Buckingham Palace also backfired after the Mail on Sunday was tipped off about the taped interview. Today the Palace is bracing itself for even more embarrassing revelations. It is claimed a second set of tapes exists about the countess's PR firm, Rhys-Jones Harkin.

      "bodyText": "The Labour party has prepared an election broadcast themed after the film Independence Day, showing the City of London under threat from a Tory spaceship representing boom and bust. The mini-movie, which has already been shot, features businessmen and women in suits looking up as a huge shadow falls over the skyscrapers of London's financial centre. The Hollywood blockbuster-inspired broadcast mirrors current Labour adverts on billboards across the country, showing the shadow chancellor Michael Portillo alongside William Hague with the slogan \"Economic Disaster II\". That poster show an explosion engulfing the two men. The new five-minute election broadcast mimics the 1996 smash hit film, which showed a shadow falling across landmark sites in New York and the White House, before an alien spaceship destroyed them in a ball of fire. \"They've clearly been watching too many movies - it's all a pathetic fantasy,\" said a Tory party insider. \"What they know full well is that they inherited the strongest economic position of modern times and no lying will get around the fact they've been reduced to negative campaigning rather than running on their own record.\" A spokesman for shadow chancellor Michael Portillo said \"There is nothing in Conservative plans which can possibly substantiate this claim of boom and bust\". Each of the main three parties is allowed five party election broadcasts during the campaign proper, now expected to run from early May to June 7. Last week Guardian Unlimited revealed how the Conservative party planned to shoot a commercial showing illegal immigrants trying to enter Britain - the ad was later dropped after widespread outcry. A spokesman for the Labour party today refused to comment on the broadcast, saying only that \"the content of Labour's election broadcasts has not yet been decided.\" \"There is no reason why Labour should not campaign on the Tory record of boom and bust,\" he went on. \"You only have to look at our economic meltdown poster campaign to see that.\" Asked if any more election broadcasts had been shot, the spokesman added \"We do not reveal Labour's election strategy ahead of time.\"",

      "body": "<b>Tuberculosis</b> <br>Nearly 2bn people, just under a third of the world's population, are infected with TB. Infection is estimated to occur at 20 times the rate of mortality but TB is still the leading cause of death from a single organism in the world today. It kills more adults each year than Aids and malaria combined. <p>The bacteria that causes the disease can survive for months if dry and is resistant to mild disinfectants. Historically, TB became an epidemic in the west during the industrial revolution when cramped living conditions in poorly sanitised cities aided its transmission. It was the leading cause of death in the industrialised nations until early last century.</p> <p>TB's grip today is intensified by the emergence of strains that are increasingly drug resistant - and these can result in an incurable form of the disease that in most cases prove fatal. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that more than 50m people worldwide may be infected with such a strain. </p> <p>The bacteria is spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or even talks, and the discharge is inhaled by a healthy person. TB begins with weight loss, lack of energy and coughing. As the disease progresses the cough gets worse and may start to bring up blood from a lesion in the lung, although any organ can be affected. When TB kills it is usually because damaged lung tissue prevents the sufferer from adequately breathing.</p> <p>Since the 1980s, the spread of HIV has contributed to an increase in TB infections. It is a significant cause of death in developing countries.</p> <p><b>Foot and mouth</b><br>Foot and mouth is probably more infectious than any other disease affecting animals - it spreads rapidly if uncontrolled. Sheep, pigs and cattle are susceptible but also hedgehogs, elephants and rats.</p> <p>There are millions of ways in which the virus can be carried. A sandwich brought over on an aeroplane from an infected country, for example, would be capable of carrying the disease.</p> <p>The 1967 outbreak, which led to the slaughter of 400,000 animals, was traced back to an infected leg of lamb from Argentina. A farmer cooked the lamb and fed the bone to his dog, which left it near some pigs. However, it can also be spread by the wind - a factor that is thought to be spreading the disease today.</p> <p>Foot and mouth is an acute infectious viral disease causing fever, followed by the development of blisters chiefly in the mouth and on the feet. Type O - the strain in Britain - started in 1991 in south Asia and spread through Arabia to first reach Europe in 1996. The UN warns that animals, animal products and humans crossing the world as either tourists or migrants could carry the virus.</p> <p><b>Ebola</b><br>Named after a river in Zaire - its first site of discovery in 1976 - the Ebola virus affects monkeys, apes and humans. It is usually fatal. Early symptoms include fever, severe headaches and loss of appetite. In the later stages vomiting, bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, sore throat, and chest pain can occur. In these cases, the virus is liquefying the internal body as it destroys the cells in the liver and the lining of all other organs. Uncontrollable internal and external bleeding is often followed by death.</p> <p>There are two principal strains: Ebola Zaire is fatal in approximately 90% of cases and Ebola Sudan in around 60%. Outbreaks have occurred predominately in Africa but there has been one in the United States. The most recent major fatalities were in 1996 in a village in Gabon, west Africa, where 70 people died after, it is believed, children found and ate an infected chimpanzee.</p> <p>The virus is spread through close contact and carries easily, though it must come from a person or primate who is already very ill with the disease. Re-using needles and caring for sufferers without adequate protection, especially if this involves coming into contact with their bodily fluids, will soon spread Ebola. The virus may also be present for a brief period in people who have made a full recovery.</p> <p>No evidence exists as yet that the Zaire and Sudan strains are airborne. The American strain, Ebola Reston, appears to have been transmitted through the air to humans from Filipino monkeys imported to a laboratory in Virginia. Four humans developed antibodies but did not become ill.</p> <p>There is no cure for Ebola and little is known about its source. Extensive ecological studies are currently underway in Cote d'Ivoire to identify the host. One theory is that the virus may be transmitted by bats who are shown to have an immunity to Ebola in tests</p> <p><b>Influenza</b><br>There are three broad varieties of influenza - types A, B and C. The virus tends to spread across the world in wave-like epidemics on regular cycles. Type A reappears every two to three years and type B every four to five. </p> <p>The 1919 epidemic killed 40m people worldwide. It is the most serious to date, though pandemics in 1957 (\"Asian flu\") and 1968 (\"Hong Kong flu\") both killed millions around the world. Influenza was first described by Hippocrates in 412 BC and the first well-described pandemic of influenza-like disease occurred in 1580. </p> <p>The infection is spread by coughing and sneezing. As the virus enters the body they attack the cells that line the upper respiratory tract. Symptoms include chills, fevers and muscular aches. Death - when it occurs - is frequently from complications such as pneumonia and bronchitis. </p> <p>Mortality is low among the young but older people are especially vunerable. A 1999 outbreak in Britain left 20,000 people dead from related illnesses. Its ability to kill stems from the fact that the virus can mutate quickly, often producing new strains against which human beings have no immunity.</p> <p>There is evidence that new strains come from animals. The 1919 epidemic is traced back to pigs and the later pandemics from birds. A 1997 outbreak of a new strain of avian (bird) flu in Hong Kong led to the slaughter of 2000 chickens. No cure exists for influenza and the most commonly followed course of action is to develop a vaccination for the next anticipated strain.</p> <p><b>Dengue fever</b><br>The WHO estimates that there are more than 50m cases of this flu-like fever each year. This mosquito-borne infection is endemic in more than a hundred countries worldwide. Before 1970 only nine countries had experienced an epidemic. </p> <p>Dengue is the leading cause of childhood mortality in several Asian countries. In adults it can lead to a temporary incapacitation but rarely death. With intensive treatment fatality rates are around 1%, but left alone they can exceed 20%. </p> <p>Besides fever, the disease is characterised by extreme pain and stiffness in the joints. There is no specific treatment and immunisation is difficult since the virus has four principal strains. Protection against only one or two of them could increase the risk of more serious disease. The most successful prevention is to destroy mosquitoes and their breeding grounds.</p>",

The mini-movie, which has already been shot, features businessmen and women in suits looking up as a huge shadow falls over the skyscrapers of London's financial centre. The Hollywood blockbuster-inspired broadcast mirrors current Labour adverts on billboards across the country, showing the shadow chancellor Michael Portillo alongside William Hague with the slogan \"Economic Disaster II\". That poster show an explosion engulfing the two men. The new five-minute election broadcast mimics the 1996 smash hit film, which showed a shadow falling across landmark sites in New York and the White House, before an alien spaceship destroyed them in a ball of fire. \"They've clearly been watching too many movies - it's all a pathetic fantasy,\" said a Tory party insider. \"What they know full well is that they inherited the strongest economic position of modern times and no lying will get around the fact they've been reduced to negative campaigning rather than running on their own record.\" A spokesman for shadow chancellor Michael Portillo said \"There is nothing in Conservative plans which can possibly substantiate this claim of boom and bust\". Each of the main three parties is allowed five party election broadcasts during the campaign proper, now expected to run from early May to June 7. Last week Guardian Unlimited revealed how the Conservative party planned to shoot a commercial showing illegal immigrants trying to enter Britain - the ad was later dropped after widespread outcry. A spokesman for the Labour party today refused to comment on the broadcast, saying only that \"the content of Labour's election broadcasts has not yet been decided.\" \"There is no reason why Labour should not campaign on the Tory record of boom and bust,\" he went on. \"You only have to look at our economic meltdown poster campaign to see that.\" Asked if any more election broadcasts had been shot, the spokesman added \"We do not reveal Labour's election strategy ahead of time.\" Related story 26.03.01: Tories to play race card Useful link Labour party",

      "body": "<p>Reuters came under fire from media analysts for a \"baffling\" decision to press ahead with a $3bn (\u00a32.1bn) float of its electronic broking business Instinet, braving plunging stock markets around the world. </p> <p>In a filing to the US securities and exchange commission, <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/\">Reuters</a> yesterday revealed that Instinet's shares would be priced at $11 to $14 on the hi-tech US Nasdaq. This values the business at $2.6bn to $3.3bn - well below initial expectations of $4bn. </p> <p>One industry analyst said: \"The timing is a mystery - I find it baffling. Maybe they think the markets are going to get worse if they delay it.\" </p> <p>Instinet provides online share dealing services to financial institutions. Reuters shares plunged 79p to 775p on concerns that the offering would be a failure. </p> <p>A Reuters spokesman said: \"We're doing this for strategic reasons, not as a device to raise money. The current market conditions won't deflect us.\" </p> <p>Reuters is offering 14% of Instinet to investors, keeping the rest of the shares itself. The spokesman said: \"There comes a time when some of the group's operations are better off with a degree of autonomy in management.\" </p> <p>Supporters of the flotation point out that it will generate money for Reuters to reinvest in the business, helping Instinet diversify from trading in equities to fixed-income investments. Paul Richards of WestLB Panmure said: \"This isn't just financial engineering - it's to raise cash to develop the business.\" </p> <p>Critics say Instinet operates in a high risk, price sensitive environment. One analyst said: \"There must be a broader agenda here. There's a lot of uncertainty about trading in Europe, and about the future of stock markets. Maybe they're planning a bid for the [London] Stock Exchange.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Reuters came under fire from media analysts for a \"baffling\" decision to press ahead with a $3bn (\u00a32.1bn) float of its electronic broking business Instinet, braving plunging stock markets around the world. In a filing to the US securities and exchange commission, Reuters yesterday revealed that Instinet's shares would be priced at $11 to $14 on the hi-tech US Nasdaq. This values the business at $2.6bn to $3.3bn - well below initial expectations of $4bn. One industry analyst said: \"The timing is a mystery - I find it baffling. Maybe they think the markets are going to get worse if they delay it.\" Instinet provides online share dealing services to financial institutions. Reuters shares plunged 79p to 775p on concerns that the offering would be a failure. A Reuters spokesman said: \"We're doing this for strategic reasons, not as a device to raise money. The current market conditions won't deflect us.\" Reuters is offering 14% of Instinet to investors, keeping the rest of the shares itself. The spokesman said: \"There comes a time when some of the group's operations are better off with a degree of autonomy in management.\" Supporters of the flotation point out that it will generate money for Reuters to reinvest in the business, helping Instinet diversify from trading in equities to fixed-income investments. Paul Richards of WestLB Panmure said: \"This isn't just financial engineering - it's to raise cash to develop the business.\" Critics say Instinet operates in a high risk, price sensitive environment. One analyst said: \"There must be a broader agenda here. There's a lot of uncertainty about trading in Europe, and about the future of stock markets. Maybe they're planning a bid for the [London] Stock Exchange.\"",

It was discovered, after comparing projections with returns, that some 20,000 people in the borough went missing. With each person worth a potential \u00a31,000 a year to the council, it is estimated Brent has since lost - or, rather, failed to atttract - a potential \u00a3200m in funding. </p> <p>The money, says Brent council, could have paid for 500 nurses, 286 police officers or 323 teachers. \"If people are invisible, we simply don't get the money,\" says council leader Ann John. \"If we get a low count, we don't get funding for services. We need people to be counted.\" </p> <p>To ensure residents participate this time, Brent is encouraging community leaders to be \"census champions\" - to spread the word about the importance of filling out the forms. Two half-day seminars have been held at the town hall for this purpose. </p> <p>Among the groups likely to ignore the forms, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which runs the census, are men aged 20-29 in inner-city areas. They are rarely in to receive or hand back forms, so this year's post-back census form is designed to combat this problem. Parents often forget to enter babies on the forms - sometimes because they are in hospital or are newborn - and elderly women over age 85 tend to be reluctant to answer the door or complete forms. Ethnic minority residents harbour a similar suspicion - and face the added disadvantage of language barriers. Other reasons for apathy include the fact that people do not understand what the census is for, or the form is seen as long and dull. </p> <p>However, a main reason for the low returns in 1991 was the notion that a big brother-style government was \"spying\" on its citizens. The fact that the last census came at the time of furore about poll tax exacerbated the public's suspicion of authority. Derek Emmot, an ONS census area manager for Leeds, who was an enumerator in the 1991 count, recalls: \"Last time, the reluctance to complete the forms was the fall-out from the poll tax: people did not want to be registered by anyone. The climate at the time was not good.\" </p> <p>This year, ONS census literature emphasises that it is illegal for the census office to pass information on to any government department or any individual. It is illegal for any data to be published for 100 years. </p> <p>To ensure that as few people as possible are invisible, the country has been divided into 115,000 enumeration districts, each containing about 200 households or 500 people. The ONS is employing 69,000 enumerators, or census takers, to distribute forms from next Monday. Forms have to be posted back after census day in pre-paid envelopes. </p> <p>The ONS is also stressing in all its literature that failure to complete and return forms can lead to prosecution and a fine of up to \u00a31,000.

The US and others say it is international airspace.</p> <p>Mr Bush's statement last night contained no hint of an apology.</p> <p>The White House said the planes had been involved in an accidental clash during an \"overt, routine\" flight.

A foreign ministry spokesman said China would \"deal appropriately with the crew and plane according to law\" once investigations had been completed. At its worst, the statement could be interpreted as a threat of a trial of the crewmen, which would plunge US-China relations to a new low. The potential for the dispute to become more confrontational was underscored when the Pentagon spokesman, Admiral Craig Quigley, was asked whether the crew should be seen as prisoners or hostages. \"I think the term is ambiguous at this point,\" he replied. \"I don't have a good answer.\" Washington drew comfort from the fact that China finally fulfilled its pledge to allow US diplomats to meet the crew - 22 from the navy, one marine and one air force member - late last night. A team of three officials spent more than 40 minutes with the crew on Hainan island. General Neal Sealock, the US embassy defence attache, confirmed they were all in good health. Meanwhile, the Pentagon said it had received intelligence reports that Chinese officials had begun removing equipment from the grounded spy plane in defiance of Monday's hands-off warning from President Bush. \"We have every reason to think the Chinese have been all over the airplane,\" the US ambassador in Beijing, Joseph Prueher, said in a television interview. Beijing maintained its demands for an apology from Washington over Sunday's mid-air clash 70 miles south of Hainan, when two Chinese F- 8 fighters challenged the EP-3 over an area of the South China sea claimed by Beijing, which concedes, however, that the site of the incident was not formally Chinese airspace. A series of cat-and-mouse manoeuvres caused one Chinese plane to crash and the US plane to make its emergency landing in China. \"The United States should face reality, take responsibility and apologise to China,\" assistant foreign minister Zhou Wenzhong said. President Jiang Zemin called on the US to promise an end to surveillance flights over the area. The US and others say it is international airspace. Mr Bush's statement last night contained no hint of an apology. The White House said the planes had been involved in an accidental clash during an \"overt, routine\" flight. The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, speaking in Florida, said of the meeting between officials and the crew: \"I hope this starts us on a road to a full and complete resolution of this matter.\" Interactive guide How did the planes collide?

      "bodyText": "A British version of the controversial reality TV show Temptation Island, which was branded \"immoral, sadistic and cynical\" when screened in the US, is to be made. The programme will be made in an unusual joint deal by Sky One and Channel 4. Channel 4 in particular is sure to face a critical backlash over the decision to buy a programme which tempts committed, but unmarried couples, into being unfaithful. In America the show has been criticised as a cynical bid to cash in others' emotional trauma in a bid to boost flagging ratings. It sparked protests from religious groups and advertisers across the Atlantic, who objected to a programme which flies couples to a tropical island and tempts them into indiscretions with attractive single people. Last week it emerged that a Los Angeles couple booted off the TV series because they have a two-year-old child are suing the producers for defamation of character. \"Temptation Island follows in the tradition of the entertainment formats which have been such a success and is great fun for a late-night slot,\" said a Channel 4 spokesman. It is believed Sky One will screen the show before Channel 4, which will show the repeat. Channel 5 pulled out of early negotiations partly because of US broadcaster Fox TV wanted to retain editorial control of the series. It wanted to continue to use the Belize island and produce the show and simply fly in a British production team to oversea the making of the series. Although no price was revealed for the deal, it is also understood Fox TV was demanding a staggering \u00a3400,000 per hour to film the series on its island location. The plot will see four committed - and highly attractive - couples marooned on a tropical island with 26 equally gorgeous beachwear-clad singletons who have been specially selected to appeal to the couples. The six-week series gained an average of 17m viewers per episode in the US. The American series was broadcast in the UK on Sky One, ending last month with viewing figures of 750,000 - impressive for a satellite channel. The show gained not only high viewing figures but notoriety in the US after family values campaigners criticised it for encouraging infidelity and treating the singles on the island as prostitutes.",

The indigenous Li and other minorities have been reduced to tourist attractions. Visa-free travel has recently been introduced for foreign tourist groups, and new motorways and hotels have proliferated. During the Vietnam war (1965-73) US spy planes regularly flew over Hainan, a base for China's supply of military equipment to North Vietnam. Until 20 years ago, the island was a closed military zone, almost shut off from the outside world ever since the communists seized power in China in the 1950s. But during the 1980s Hainan got a reputation as a wild frontier place where almost anything went. During that decade, the capital of Haikou became notorious for building scams and open prostitution, before these appeared widely elsewhere in China as economic liberalisation crept in. The city of Sanya, close to where Beijing says the US spy plane was operating, used to be a holiday resort for select government and military officials. Interactive guide How did the planes collide?

The crew should have been able to destroy or wipe hard disks as well as disable lighter equipment during the 30-60 minutes it is estimated to have taken the plane to fly to Hainan island after the collision with an F-8 Chinese jet. This should prevent the Chinese from finding out what the US aircraft picked up, and how the information was interpreted by its crew. But they might be able to discover the general capabilities of the eavesdropping equipment, including the exterior antennae, aerials, sensors, scanners and radomes. The aircraft's crew consists of 22 navy personnel, one air force officer and one marine. Reports say three of those on board were women. The incident is a political test for the new Bush administration, which describes China as a \"strategic competitor\". China has been threatening unspecified consequences if Washington sells Taiwan the advanced ship-based Aegis radar system which, with the Patriot missile system, would provide Taiwan with an anti-missile shield.

      "bodyText": "When George Bush and his national security team gathered in the White House situation room on Sunday to weigh their response to the US spy plane's emergency landing in China, the fiercest debate around the table focused on two key issues. First, should Mr Bush immediately telephone his Chinese opposite number, Jiang Zemin, in Beijing to demand the return of the plane and its crew? And second, should Mr Bush go on American television to address the nation about the incident? The discussion went back and forth, but in the end, in both cases, the answer to the questions was No. Like the dog in the Sherlock Holmes story that did not bark in the night, the phone call that was never placed and the broadcast that was never made could hold the key to understanding the way the Bush administration has approached its first international crisis. In those key early encounters Mr Bush and his team took the decision to play the embryonic crisis tough but cool. They would make clear how they expected China to respond, but they would do it through traditional diplomacy, not through the television studios. \"We really want to work this out through diplomatic channels,\" the US ambassador to Beijing, Joseph Prueher, said yesterday. \"The lead will stay with the state department,\" a Pentagon spokesman confirmed. Whether that determination can withstand an escalation of the crisis or a failure to find a quick solution is another matter, however. The White House described last night's meeting between US diplomats and the 24 members of the spy plane's crew as a \"positive development\" but there was no sign that Washington was prepared to issue the public apology that was being demanded in Beijing. The Bush administration nevertheless put on a show of business as usual yesterday as the crisis developed but the tactics appeared to change. At 9pm last night as Mr Bush made a statement on the developing crisis as he returned to Washington from a brief trip to Delaware. He had been there to promote his education reform package. Vice-president Dick Cheney had also played it low key, travelling alongside Mr Bush but making no public pronouncements. The White House's national security team, led by Condoleezza Rice, kept in the background too, as they have done throughout the crisis. With both the White House and the state department cancelling their daily on-the-record press briefings, it was clear that the administration was seeking to exert maximum control over its message, ensuring that Beijing would receive only the signals that Washington had authorised. The situation was \"very delicate, very difficult\", a White House official said. Only the Pentagon press spokesman, Admiral Craig Quigley, carried out a regular press briefing session yesterday before Mr Bush made his statement. Defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld also stayed out of sight. The only high profile member of the administration to make a public statement in the first part of the day was secretary of state Colin Powell. Mr Powell had travelled to Key West, Florida, in another show of normality, to attend US-sponsored talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the future of the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, where he gave a brief but generally conciliatory and low-key reading of the latest developments to journalists in a short press appearance. The line in Washington throughout the stand-off so far has been that the administration is anxious \"to give the Chinese time to get to the right decision\", as one official put it yesterday. Washington remains anxious that the spy plane incident should not spiral into a major confrontation with China, even though it comes at a time when US-China relations are poised for a stormy phase over the issue of Taiwan arms sales. Officials continue to treat the emergency landing of the EP-3 plane on Hainan as \"an accident not an incident\". As if to underline the effort to ensure that the Hainan island stand-off is not being allowed to become the sole focus of US-China relations, the state department ensured that yesterday's introduction of a regular daily UPS parcels delivery flight from the US to Shanghai went ahead as planned. Even conservative Republican politicians who can normally be counted on to rattle their sabres were sticking to official party discipline over the incident. Senator Jesse Helms, the influential Republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, said yesterday that he had \"very strong opinions\" on the stand-off, but said that he \"did not want to aggravate the debate by giving those opinions\". The reality is that China, not the US, has most of the important cards in its hands. Washington's initial stance of making firm demands to Beijing for the return of the crew and the plane, was giving way yesterday to a private recognition that China had the initiative.

      "body": "<p>It's a bit rich, isn't it? Europe, home to J\u00f6rg Haider and Jean-Marie Le Pen, scolding us for being the most racist nation of the bunch. Who are the Germans - longtime deniers of citizenship to Turkish gastarbeiten, even those born in the country - to declare our attitude to refugees and asylum seekers the worst in Europe? Where do the French, whose casual harassment of non-whites is noticed by every black traveller across the Channel, get off scolding us? Who made the Danes, with a scarily energetic rightwing of their own, the PC-police of the continent?</p> <p>That would be one way of dealing with the latest European assault on Britain, yesterday's report from the Council of Europe diagnosing a \"particularly acute\" form of racism here. We could protest that we're no worse than everyone else. Or we might slay the messenger, noting that the council is a glorified talking shop unrelated to the European Union, whose reports are usually consigned to the filing cabinet of history. We might tease the council's investigators, who came here nearly a year ago for a grand total of four days.</p> <p>All those lines of attack are open, and every one of them was taken by politician and pundit alike yesterday. But there is another, less predictable response: we can listen. We can pause for a second and see ourselves the way our neighbours see us. We may be in for an unpleasant surprise.</p> <p>So we might listen to the council's claim that we tend to think of economic migrants not as people seeking a better life - which is admirable - but as parasites and \"criminals trying to sneak into our country\". We might consider, and not dismiss, the EU's racism and xenophobia monitoring unit in Vienna, which last month ranked Britain, of all the 15 member states, as the nation most hostile to political refugees.</p> <p>We might decide that, judging by our present form, the Europeans have got us about right. Just last week we had outgoing Tory MPs John Townend and Christopher Gill offer up a double-act of Powellite xenophobia and stale, halitotic bigotry. No sooner had Townend sung the praises of old Enoch, lamenting that \"Commonwealth immigration\" had undermined our \"homogenous Anglo-Saxon society,\" than Gill was backing him up. Rising numbers of asylum seekers were causing a \"rats in a bucket syndrome\", diluting our national character. \"If you pour enough water on a double scotch,\" he said, \"it ceases to taste like whisky.\"</p> <p>Since neither of these men were denied the Conservative whip in the Commons, we can fairly conclude that William Hague sees no great contradiction between their views and parliamentary service for his party. And why should he? Did not Hague authorise a leaflet for last year's local elections warning of \"bogus asylum seekers... flooding\" our shores? Did he not raise the alarm recently about Britain becoming a \"foreign land\"?</p> <p>So maybe the Euro-inspectors were not so wrong about us after all. But there is a juicier irony here, juicier even than the notion of a continent which houses the Freedom party and the Front Nationale ordering us to clean up our act. It is that, after years of putting up with British Euroscepticism, Europe is finally getting its own back.</p> <p>Call it Britoscepticism. From the European heads of government furious with a British agriculture which has, once again, infected the continent with disease, to a foreign press that has branded our country Plague Island, our neighbours seem set to make Eurosceptic dreams come true. The British right-wing always longed for Britain to break from the continent; now, apparently, the continent wants shot of us.</p> <p>It's not just the headlines announcing the Katastrophe of the Animalisches Inferno - though medieval images of pyres and burning flesh have fattened up foreign news bulletins for a month and half now. Our neighbours have connected our latest crisis, over foot and mouth, with a deeper malaise.</p> <p>We are, they say, the \"sick man of Europe,\" the \"septic isle\". For them, foot and mouth is not an isolated, freakish episode but part of a continuum - with BSE the defining event. It is because of mad cow disease, which did have lethal implications for humans, that foreigners have assumed the worst about F&amp;M - even thought the worst damage F&amp;M might inflict on a person would be a cold sore. It's no wonder that NBC News warns Americans of \"the killer disease now stalking Britain - and how we can stop it coming here\". When it comes to food safety, we are not trusted: we have previous.</p> <p>But the problem is deeper still. Foreign observers are linking foot and mouth not only with our agricultural plight, but with the very way we function as a society. Italy's L'Espresso cited our stubborn rates of poverty, the Hatfield rail disaster and the Real IRA's ongoing campaign of bombing, as well as the animal epidemics, as proof that Britain was a nation under a \"curse\". Doubtless they will now be adding the return of tuberculosis, disclosed yesterday, to their list.</p> <p>Thomas Keilinger of Germany's Die Welt writes of the parlous state of our public services, particularly the hospitals and railways. One despatch announced that Britain is \"slowly disappearing in the mire of the real-existing chaos\".</p> <p>Keilinger has told his readers of our lack of patriotism, the vacuity of the dome, the winter floods and our appalling weather. Germans are Anglophiles, he says, but they need to temper their fondness with the truth about this country.</p> <p>\"I think we felt that, after Thatcherism, Britain was a shining example of America-style, go-getting entrepreneurial savvy. Now we realise there is so much that is still creaky... the Thatcher revolution left whole swaths of society destitute, struggling to survive.\" He has said that, after the Russians, the British may be the longest-suffering populace in the world - prepared to put up with sub-standard services when others would have revolted against them decades ago.</p> <p>Of course, there is some journalistic hyperbole here, as there would be if the roles were reversed. But it's hard not to see a warning. For years, we were like the old wartime headline-writer who decided that, since the Channel was fog-bound, the continent was cut off - not us. For years, we assumed that Britain was the great catch, with Europe the pushy suitor desperate for our hand. The Eurosceptic case rested on a British arrogance which saw our participation in the EU as a kind of favour to those grasping, desperate continentals.</p> <p>Now we can see that the true situation may be the other way around. Having heard our press and politicians pour scorn and disdain on them for generations, the Europeans are exacting their revenge.

      "bodyText": "It's a bit rich, isn't it? Europe, home to J\u00f6rg Haider and Jean-Marie Le Pen, scolding us for being the most racist nation of the bunch. Who are the Germans - longtime deniers of citizenship to Turkish gastarbeiten, even those born in the country - to declare our attitude to refugees and asylum seekers the worst in Europe? Where do the French, whose casual harassment of non-whites is noticed by every black traveller across the Channel, get off scolding us? Who made the Danes, with a scarily energetic rightwing of their own, the PC-police of the continent? That would be one way of dealing with the latest European assault on Britain, yesterday's report from the Council of Europe diagnosing a \"particularly acute\" form of racism here. We could protest that we're no worse than everyone else. Or we might slay the messenger, noting that the council is a glorified talking shop unrelated to the European Union, whose reports are usually consigned to the filing cabinet of history. We might tease the council's investigators, who came here nearly a year ago for a grand total of four days. All those lines of attack are open, and every one of them was taken by politician and pundit alike yesterday. But there is another, less predictable response: we can listen. We can pause for a second and see ourselves the way our neighbours see us. We may be in for an unpleasant surprise. So we might listen to the council's claim that we tend to think of economic migrants not as people seeking a better life - which is admirable - but as parasites and \"criminals trying to sneak into our country\". We might consider, and not dismiss, the EU's racism and xenophobia monitoring unit in Vienna, which last month ranked Britain, of all the 15 member states, as the nation most hostile to political refugees. We might decide that, judging by our present form, the Europeans have got us about right. Just last week we had outgoing Tory MPs John Townend and Christopher Gill offer up a double-act of Powellite xenophobia and stale, halitotic bigotry. No sooner had Townend sung the praises of old Enoch, lamenting that \"Commonwealth immigration\" had undermined our \"homogenous Anglo-Saxon society,\" than Gill was backing him up. Rising numbers of asylum seekers were causing a \"rats in a bucket syndrome\", diluting our national character. \"If you pour enough water on a double scotch,\" he said, \"it ceases to taste like whisky.\" Since neither of these men were denied the Conservative whip in the Commons, we can fairly conclude that William Hague sees no great contradiction between their views and parliamentary service for his party. And why should he? Did not Hague authorise a leaflet for last year's local elections warning of \"bogus asylum seekers... flooding\" our shores? Did he not raise the alarm recently about Britain becoming a \"foreign land\"? So maybe the Euro-inspectors were not so wrong about us after all. But there is a juicier irony here, juicier even than the notion of a continent which houses the Freedom party and the Front Nationale ordering us to clean up our act. It is that, after years of putting up with British Euroscepticism, Europe is finally getting its own back. Call it Britoscepticism. From the European heads of government furious with a British agriculture which has, once again, infected the continent with disease, to a foreign press that has branded our country Plague Island, our neighbours seem set to make Eurosceptic dreams come true. The British right-wing always longed for Britain to break from the continent; now, apparently, the continent wants shot of us. It's not just the headlines announcing the Katastrophe of the Animalisches Inferno - though medieval images of pyres and burning flesh have fattened up foreign news bulletins for a month and half now. Our neighbours have connected our latest crisis, over foot and mouth, with a deeper malaise. We are, they say, the \"sick man of Europe,\" the \"septic isle\". For them, foot and mouth is not an isolated, freakish episode but part of a continuum - with BSE the defining event. It is because of mad cow disease, which did have lethal implications for humans, that foreigners have assumed the worst about F&amp;M - even thought the worst damage F&amp;M might inflict on a person would be a cold sore. It's no wonder that NBC News warns Americans of \"the killer disease now stalking Britain - and how we can stop it coming here\". When it comes to food safety, we are not trusted: we have previous. But the problem is deeper still. Foreign observers are linking foot and mouth not only with our agricultural plight, but with the very way we function as a society. Italy's L'Espresso cited our stubborn rates of poverty, the Hatfield rail disaster and the Real IRA's ongoing campaign of bombing, as well as the animal epidemics, as proof that Britain was a nation under a \"curse\". Doubtless they will now be adding the return of tuberculosis, disclosed yesterday, to their list. Thomas Keilinger of Germany's Die Welt writes of the parlous state of our public services, particularly the hospitals and railways. One despatch announced that Britain is \"slowly disappearing in the mire of the real-existing chaos\". Keilinger has told his readers of our lack of patriotism, the vacuity of the dome, the winter floods and our appalling weather. Germans are Anglophiles, he says, but they need to temper their fondness with the truth about this country. \"I think we felt that, after Thatcherism, Britain was a shining example of America-style, go-getting entrepreneurial savvy. Now we realise there is so much that is still creaky... the Thatcher revolution left whole swaths of society destitute, struggling to survive.\" He has said that, after the Russians, the British may be the longest-suffering populace in the world - prepared to put up with sub-standard services when others would have revolted against them decades ago. Of course, there is some journalistic hyperbole here, as there would be if the roles were reversed. But it's hard not to see a warning. For years, we were like the old wartime headline-writer who decided that, since the Channel was fog-bound, the continent was cut off - not us. For years, we assumed that Britain was the great catch, with Europe the pushy suitor desperate for our hand. The Eurosceptic case rested on a British arrogance which saw our participation in the EU as a kind of favour to those grasping, desperate continentals. Now we can see that the true situation may be the other way around. Having heard our press and politicians pour scorn and disdain on them for generations, the Europeans are exacting their revenge. They are seeing Britain as Europe's sick man, a charity case which needs their help. When the time finally comes for Tony Blair to make good his promise to be \"at the heart of Europe,\" he may find the dynamic has changed. Far from welcoming him in as a young, energetic saviour, the neighbours might offer him a look of pity and a cup of sweetened tea - but only after he's wiped his feet in a trough of disinfectant. comment@theguardian.com Useful links: Immigration and asylum act, 1999 Home office information on vouchers",

A committee of MPs complained to the ombudsman, Michael Buckley, about Mr Vaz's conduct after he refused to show them correspondence about the dam. The international development committee wanted to see the letters because it said the government's evidence had been \"starkly contradictory\" and the Foreign Office's \"subsequent attempts at explanation [were] vague, unconvincing and on occasion desperate\". This latest blow to the European affairs minister is part of an investigation by MPs into a \u00a3200m government credit backing for Balfour Beatty to construct the dam in Turkey which will drown 46 Kurdish towns and villages and threaten the water supply of Syria and Iraq. Richard Caborn, trade minister, and Vivian Brown, chief executive of the export credit guarantee department, told the committee Mr Vaz had not given advice on the human rights and security implications of backing the project before they decided in principle to go ahead. The MPs subsequently published a report saying the Foreign Office had abdicated its duty on human rights. In an angry letter to the committee, Mr Vaz told them they were wrong and denied he had failed to brief his fellow ministers.

We cannot understand why the government has not yet introduced legislation to deal with this shameful situation, especially as the issue is unlikely to be controversial.\"</p> <p>As long as the convention was not implemented, the committee said, Britain could not credibly continue to make improvements in other countries' governance a condition of development aid.</p> <p>The committee also criticised the \"entirely unsatisfactory\" practice, confirmed by Treasury officials, whereby British companies that pay bribes wholly outside the UK can claim tax relief on them. Evidence presented to the committee from pressure groups suggested western businesses paid bribes conservatively estimated at \u00a353bn a year, with the arms and construction industries the worst offenders.</p> <p>Though it welcomed government plans to update the laws against money laundering, the report said Britain's response to the problem of corruption was uncoordinated and piecemeal, with enforcement bodies underfunded and underresourced. \"We are deeply concerned about the vulnerability of one of this country's most valuable financial assets - the City of London,\" the report said.</p> <p>Weaknesses in the banking system were highlighted last month, the report noted, with the publication of an investigation by the financial services authority into accounts linked to the family and associates of the late Nigerian president Sani Abacha. It found that 42 accounts held at 23 banks in the UK had a turnover of \u00a30.87bn between 1996 and 2000. Fifteen of the banks, including Barclays and Midland, had \"significant control weaknesses\"; seven have been ordered to correct failings, which may lead to prosecutions.</p> <p>A particular weakness was identified as the \"patchy\" reporting of suspicious transactions to the national criminal intelligence service, especially by lawyers and accountants who are prime targets for money launderers.</p> <p>Lawyers, under the cloak of client confidentiality, can mask the beneficial owners of accounts. Both professions, the report said, should be given mandatory training on the prevention of money laundering.</p> <p>The Conservative chairman of the committee, Bowen Wells MP, said yesterday: \"We have not at the moment got any effective defence against these practices. We are a world centre for laundering the proceeds of bribery and fraud.\"</p> <p>A number of senior executives from BP, Unilever and Balfour Beatty admitted to the committee that they paid low-level \"facilitation payments\" abroad to get things done quickly.</p> <p>But the committee was unequivocal that this was corruption, and should be made illegal: \"We see no difference between bribery and facilitation payments.\"</p>",

We cannot understand why the government has not yet introduced legislation to deal with this shameful situation, especially as the issue is unlikely to be controversial.\" As long as the convention was not implemented, the committee said, Britain could not credibly continue to make improvements in other countries' governance a condition of development aid. The committee also criticised the \"entirely unsatisfactory\" practice, confirmed by Treasury officials, whereby British companies that pay bribes wholly outside the UK can claim tax relief on them. Evidence presented to the committee from pressure groups suggested western businesses paid bribes conservatively estimated at \u00a353bn a year, with the arms and construction industries the worst offenders. Though it welcomed government plans to update the laws against money laundering, the report said Britain's response to the problem of corruption was uncoordinated and piecemeal, with enforcement bodies underfunded and underresourced. \"We are deeply concerned about the vulnerability of one of this country's most valuable financial assets - the City of London,\" the report said. Weaknesses in the banking system were highlighted last month, the report noted, with the publication of an investigation by the financial services authority into accounts linked to the family and associates of the late Nigerian president Sani Abacha. It found that 42 accounts held at 23 banks in the UK had a turnover of \u00a30.87bn between 1996 and 2000. Fifteen of the banks, including Barclays and Midland, had \"significant control weaknesses\"; seven have been ordered to correct failings, which may lead to prosecutions. A particular weakness was identified as the \"patchy\" reporting of suspicious transactions to the national criminal intelligence service, especially by lawyers and accountants who are prime targets for money launderers. Lawyers, under the cloak of client confidentiality, can mask the beneficial owners of accounts. Both professions, the report said, should be given mandatory training on the prevention of money laundering. The Conservative chairman of the committee, Bowen Wells MP, said yesterday: \"We have not at the moment got any effective defence against these practices. We are a world centre for laundering the proceeds of bribery and fraud.\" A number of senior executives from BP, Unilever and Balfour Beatty admitted to the committee that they paid low-level \"facilitation payments\" abroad to get things done quickly. But the committee was unequivocal that this was corruption, and should be made illegal: \"We see no difference between bribery and facilitation payments.\"",

Far from helping deprived people, the discretionary social fund is \"adding to the poverty and social exclusion of families with children\" by plunging them further into debt and denying them access to basic necessities, says the study, out today. The report, following an inquiry by the social security select committee, presses the government to overhaul the fund, which issues grants and lends money at low rates of interest to families in need. The crisis loans are intended to pay for essentials such as cookers and fridges. The fund, which is overseen by the Department for Social Security, has been criticised by poverty campaigners and the Liberal Democrats for forcing poor families who take out the loans into deeper poverty as they attempt to keep up with repayments while they are living on benefits. Helen Dent, of the Family Welfare Association, a charity which provides crisis grants for poor families who slip through the welfare net, called on the government to switch from an emergency loans system to grants.

Though a public inquiry is the most likely option - as it was after the 1967 and 1952 outbreaks - ministers may want to narrow its terms and direction.</p> <p>Mr Meacher appeared to pre-empt Mr Blair's options. \"Unquestionably, there will be [an inquiry] this time, to ascertain the cause and how it happened, and the way we can prevent it happening again. We will want to know how the disease got such a hold and the levels of animal transport across the country.\"</p> <p>But significantly, the man in charge of the rural taskforce added that the wider future of farming and the rural economy will also be examined, possibly leading to more emphasis on organic production, small abattoirs and local production methods.</p> <p>No sooner had the Tory farms spokesman, Tim Yeo, complained that the minister was slipping out an important statement than No 10 gently slapped him down. \"Mr Meacher is a very fine minister. No decision has been taken on the form of the inquiry.\"</p> <p>He was not the only politician in hot water.

      "bodyText": "The environment minister, Michael Meacher, last night caused embarrassment for Tony Blair when he jumped the gun by announcing that there will be a public inquiry into the foot and mouth outbreak once the crisis is over, including an examination of alternative farming methods. As both Mr Blair and William Hague toured the frontline hot spots yesterday on the 44th day of the crisis - with 1,000 cases and 2m animals marked down for slaughter - it was one of a series of errors and misjudgments: \u0095 No 10 promised that \"lessons will be learned\" from the outbreak, but told Mr Meacher that \"no decision has been taken on the form of the inquiry\"; \u0095 Mr Hague asked for the army to be given full operational control over the slaughter, transport and destruction of infected animals, only to be told by the senior officer in Cumbria that he is happy with current arrangements; \u0095 Officials admitted that almost 900 sheep and cattle buried in a disused quarry in Tow Law, County Durham, against the advice of the environment agency, will have to be dug up and reburied amid fears of local water pollution; \u0095 Ministers admitted that, as reported in yesterday's Guardian, official website figures on the daily rise in cases and the numbers of animals awaiting slaughter have been \"confusing\" and \"insufficiently robust\". But it was Mr Meacher's burst of candour at the launch of the Countryside Agency's annual report which caused most alarm. Though a public inquiry is the most likely option - as it was after the 1967 and 1952 outbreaks - ministers may want to narrow its terms and direction. Mr Meacher appeared to pre-empt Mr Blair's options. \"Unquestionably, there will be [an inquiry] this time, to ascertain the cause and how it happened, and the way we can prevent it happening again. We will want to know how the disease got such a hold and the levels of animal transport across the country.\" But significantly, the man in charge of the rural taskforce added that the wider future of farming and the rural economy will also be examined, possibly leading to more emphasis on organic production, small abattoirs and local production methods. No sooner had the Tory farms spokesman, Tim Yeo, complained that the minister was slipping out an important statement than No 10 gently slapped him down. \"Mr Meacher is a very fine minister. No decision has been taken on the form of the inquiry.\" He was not the only politician in hot water. Though Hague aides later claimed that the Tory leader had informed the army before suggesting it take full operational control of the clean-up, the army's response was cool. Brigadier Alex Birtwistle, the officer in charge of the military team in Cumbria, told ITN : \"It is quite right and proper for it to be a Maff-led operation. To be frank, I don't want to lead this operation. It would be too much trouble, too difficult to do.\" At Tow Law, army diggers will set to work on Friday to dig up the 650 sheep and farmer Douglas Forster's prize herd of thoroughbred cattle because officials fear that the polluted material will filter through gravel beds into a spring which supplies water to local farms. The environment agency explained that it had warned that the site was not suitable \"but, for whatever reason, that advice was not followed.\" The army suggested there had been a mix-up in instructions between two local sites. Mr Forster called it \"an honest mistake\". In another sign of the authorities being stretched to their limits, a pyre in Cumbria with 200 cows waiting to be burned will have to be dismantled after fears for the health of nearby villagers. Downing Street's admission that Maff website data is confusing was blamed on the fact that \"bureaucracy and paperwork has not been a priority\".

      "bodyText": "Today George Bush faces the most difficult day of his presidency so far, as he decides how to respond to Beijing's apparent determination to force concessions from the US administration in return for the release of the 24 crew members of the American spy plane detained in China. Yesterday in the White House rose garden, Mr Bush made his second brief statement on the trial of strength with Beijing over the plane and its crew. The tone was more terse than when the president spoke on Monday. \"It is time for our servicemen and women to return home. It is time for the Chinese government to return our plane,\" President Bush said before turning on his heels and disappearing back into the White House without answering shouted questions about whether he considered the crew to be hostages. When Mr Bush and his national security team gathered in the White House situation room on Sunday to weigh their response to the emergency landing of the plane - damaged when it collided with a Chinese warplane above a disputed area of sea claimed by China - they hoped that the drama would not turn into a crisis. The group agreed quickly on the generally low-key tone that prevailed in the first three days of Washington's handling of the issue - a tone that is provoking mounting dissent among Republican hawks in and out of the administration. At first, the fiercest debate around the table focused on two issues, according to US reports. Should Mr Bush telephone President Jiang Zemin right away to demand the return of the plane and its crew? And should he address the nation on TV about the incident? The discussion went back and forth, but in the end, the answer to both was, no. Mr Bush and his team decided to play the embryonic crisis tough but cool. They would make clear how they expected China to respond, but they would do it through diplomacy, not TV. \"We really want to work this out through diplomatic channels,\" the US ambassador to Beijing, Joseph Prueher, said yesterday. \"The lead will stay with the state department,\" a Pentagon official confirmed. Whether that determination can hold if things become more heated is another matter. The White House described last night's meeting between US diplomats and the 24 members of the spy plane's crew as a \"positive development\" but there was no sign of the apology Beijing wants coming from Washington - which is not alone in rejecting China's attempts to claim a swath of the South China sea. The Bush administration put on a show of business as usual yesterday but the tactics appeared to change when Mr Bush made his brusque statement on the developing crisis at 9pm after he returned to Washington from a brief trip to Delaware to promote his education reform package. Vice-president Dick Cheney and the White House's national security team led by Condoleezza Rice had all kept in the background during the day, as they have throughout the standoff. The defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, kept out of sight and the secretary of state, Colin Powell, kept his remarks brief and concilatory. The White House and the state department cancelled their daily on-the-record press briefings, showing that the ad ministration was seeking to exert maximum control over its message, ensuring that Beijing would receive only signals conveyed directly by Washington. The situation was \"very delicate, very difficult\", a White House official said. Only the Pentagon press spokesman, Admiral Craig Quigley, carried out a regular press briefing yesterday before Mr Bush made his statement. The line in Washington so far has been that the administration is anxious \"to give the Chinese time to get to the right decision\", as one official put it yesterday. Mr Bush repeated that phrase in his statement. The US does not want things to spiral into a confrontation with China, not least because relations are about to be stormy anyway over US plans for new military sales to Taiwan. Officials continue to treat the aerial encounter and the emergency landing of the US plane on Hainan as \"an accident not an incident\". Underlining that normality was the aim, yesterday's introduction of a regular daily UPS parcels delivery flight from the US to Shanghai went ahead as planned. Senator Jesse Helms, the influential Republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, said yesterday that he had \"very strong opinions\" on the stand-off, but said that he \"did not want to aggravate the situation by giving those opinions\". Washington's initial stance of making firm demands for the return of the crew and the plane, was giving way yesterday to a private recognition that China had much of the initiative.

      "body": "<p>It was China's turn yesterday to raise the stakes in the spy plane row with the United States: a series of statements piled on the pressure during the day. As so often with Chinese diplomacy, it was a mixture of tough talk and subtle hints needing careful study of the original text.</p> <p>The all-important threat from the Chinese foreign ministry to put the crew of the US spy plane through a potentially lengthy legal process came right at the end of an extensive statement from the ministry's spokesman, Zhu Bangzao.</p> <p>Even then, the threat was given only in the Chinese version - the whole phrase was omitted from the otherwise full English summary of Mr Zhu's remarks put out last night.</p> <p>State department analysts will be studying word by word his declaration that when China has completed its investigation, it will \"deal appropriately with the crew and plane according to law\".</p> <p>The verb to \"deal with\" ( chuli ) can also be translated as \"to punish\", especially when used with the phrase \"according to law\" ( yifa ). But it is a threat rather than a cast-iron commitment, no doubt designed to make Washington think again.</p> <p>The official followed up with another tough demand: the US should \"cooperate conscientiously with the Chinese investigation\" and make a full apology.</p> <p>Washington is the primary audience for this Chinese offensive, but Beijing's political tacticians will have designed it with domestic listeners in mind too. In the crisis public opinion has emerged as a factor the Chinese government must consider.</p> <p>A wide range of outspoken unofficial views have been expressed on popular websites - including one run by the official People's Daily newspaper. Some contributors are criticising the official line as too \"diplomatic.\"</p> <p>\"In the past 'public opinion' was mostly dictated by what the newspapers and the government laid down,\" according to a strategic analyst in Beijing, Gao Chaoqun. \"Now it can express itself in a more independent way, particularly through the voices of younger people on the web.\"</p> <p>The dominant mood of anger was summed up yesterday in a website message declaring that \"Blood must be repaid with blood: Americans - listen!\"</p> <p>\"When you are thousands of miles from our land,\" it asked, \"what pretext do you have for allowing your warplanes to fly in our airspace?\" (Beijing concedes this was not its airspace.)</p> <p>Other contributors bitterly recalled the US bomb that fell on Beijing's embassy in Belgrade two years ago when Nato was bombing targets across Serbia during the Kosovo conflict. Many Chinese doubt that the embassy bombing was an accident.</p> <p>Several called in terms once used by Mao Zedong for the Chinese people to \"stand up and not kneel down\". Some have complained that the government adopted too low a profile initially: there were sarcastic comments about the main story in Monday's People's Daily, which was said read more like an account of an official tree-planting ceremony than of a mid-air crash.</p> <p>Many have suggested that the government should harden its line by \"raising the price\" (as Mr Jiang has now done) for meeting US demands for the return of its 24 crew members.</p> <p>Outside observers are not sure whether the government is being moved by public pressure or is being steered in a direction it intends to take anyhow: perhaps both are at work.</p> <p>Not everyone is calling for retribution. Cautious unofficial voices have warned that too hard a line could put ammunition in the hands of the US pro-Taiwan lobby.</p> <p>\"We should give back the plane and its crew and show compassion,\" argued one contributor to the People's Daily website. \"Our main task is to prevent Taiwan from getting advanced weaponry from the US.\"</p> <p>President Jiang Zemin, too, indicated yesterday that he still hopes the US-China relationship will return to a normal track. All his advisers have been urging him to give President George Bush the benefit of the doubt in spite of the anti-China noises from the new US administration.</p> <p>Mr Gao, the strategic analyst, said that public opinion was a short-term factor, but that the government would be more guided by the need to takea long-term view on policy towards the US. But the spy plane crisis is putting such moderation under immense strain.</p> <p>The existence of a US surveillance programme against China - though well known in government and military circles - has now entered the public domain in one dramatic stroke.</p> <p>Popular newspapers have published details - taken directly from the US media - of the capabilities and crew of the EP-3 aircraft, and of its spying operations against China.</p> <p>Having made the demand that such missions should stop, will Beijing pretend nothing is happening if they go on?</p> <p>The US claim that it was over international waters has not gone down well at the official or popular level, though Beijing admits the US plane was not in Chinese airspace. Washington's image has also suffered from its failure to express sadness over the missing Chinese airman who must now be presumed dead. The pilot was named yesterday as Wang Wei. Chinese news agencies reported that he had parachuted out of his F-8 jet after the collision but he has not been found.</p> <p>But the Chinese media have made a point of stressing Mr Jiang's concern about the pilot - which also took some time to emerge.</p> <p>Beijing's case now includes complex but significant arguments about the legality of the US spy flights.</p> <p>Mr Zhu argued that although the collision did not happen in Chinese airspace, it was over an \"exclusive economic zone\" which Beijing claims in the South China sea - a territorial claim that is disputed in the region.</p> <p>He argued that while UN law allows peaceful transit over such areas this did not cover spying activities. He also revealed that the US and China had reached an agreement last year on \"avoiding military risks in sea areas\" - which the US had now violated.</p> <p>The Chinese are arch-negotiators, but they are angry and not inclined to roll over to what they call US hegemonism.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,468255,00.html\">04.04.2001: 'They must come home'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,468288,00.html\">04.04.2001: Decision day for untested Bush</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,468252,00.html\">04.04.2001: 'I hope they don't interrogate him'</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,468287,00.html\">04.04.2001: Front line for Beijing's claims to sea</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,468262,00.html\">04.04.2001: US looks for diplomatic solution</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,468259,00.html\">04.04.2001: An explicit threat - but only in Chinese</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,468256,00.html\">04.04.2001: Spy crew under orders to destroy key equipment</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,468264,00.html\">04.04.2001: Conflicting stories of how the aircraft collided</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,468267,00.html\">04.04.2001: Missing Chinese pilot is named</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush/story/0,7369,467967,00.html\">What the US papers say</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/\">Special report: China</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/bush/\">Special report: George Bush's America</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/flash/0,7365,468031,00.html\">How did the planes collide?</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b> <br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee80fe0\">Should Bush make China America's number one enemy?</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.chinfo.navy.mil/navpalib/factfile/aircraft/air-ep3e.html\" target=\"_new\">US navy factfile on the EP-3E spy plane</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.PACOM.MIL/SPEECHES/SST2001/010401BLAIRPLANE.HTM\" target=\"_new\">US Pacific command</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/english/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">China: official government site</a><br><a href=\"http://www.chinatimes.com.tw/\" target=\"_new\">China Times</a><br><a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/\" target=\"_new\">China Daily</a></p>",

The all-important threat from the Chinese foreign ministry to put the crew of the US spy plane through a potentially lengthy legal process came right at the end of an extensive statement from the ministry's spokesman, Zhu Bangzao. Even then, the threat was given only in the Chinese version - the whole phrase was omitted from the otherwise full English summary of Mr Zhu's remarks put out last night. State department analysts will be studying word by word his declaration that when China has completed its investigation, it will \"deal appropriately with the crew and plane according to law\". The verb to \"deal with\" ( chuli ) can also be translated as \"to punish\", especially when used with the phrase \"according to law\" ( yifa ). But it is a threat rather than a cast-iron commitment, no doubt designed to make Washington think again. The official followed up with another tough demand: the US should \"cooperate conscientiously with the Chinese investigation\" and make a full apology. Washington is the primary audience for this Chinese offensive, but Beijing's political tacticians will have designed it with domestic listeners in mind too. In the crisis public opinion has emerged as a factor the Chinese government must consider. A wide range of outspoken unofficial views have been expressed on popular websites - including one run by the official People's Daily newspaper. Some contributors are criticising the official line as too \"diplomatic.\" \"In the past 'public opinion' was mostly dictated by what the newspapers and the government laid down,\" according to a strategic analyst in Beijing, Gao Chaoqun. \"Now it can express itself in a more independent way, particularly through the voices of younger people on the web.\" The dominant mood of anger was summed up yesterday in a website message declaring that \"Blood must be repaid with blood: Americans - listen!\" \"When you are thousands of miles from our land,\" it asked, \"what pretext do you have for allowing your warplanes to fly in our airspace?\" (Beijing concedes this was not its airspace.) Other contributors bitterly recalled the US bomb that fell on Beijing's embassy in Belgrade two years ago when Nato was bombing targets across Serbia during the Kosovo conflict. Many Chinese doubt that the embassy bombing was an accident. Several called in terms once used by Mao Zedong for the Chinese people to \"stand up and not kneel down\". Some have complained that the government adopted too low a profile initially: there were sarcastic comments about the main story in Monday's People's Daily, which was said read more like an account of an official tree-planting ceremony than of a mid-air crash. Many have suggested that the government should harden its line by \"raising the price\" (as Mr Jiang has now done) for meeting US demands for the return of its 24 crew members. Outside observers are not sure whether the government is being moved by public pressure or is being steered in a direction it intends to take anyhow: perhaps both are at work. Not everyone is calling for retribution. Cautious unofficial voices have warned that too hard a line could put ammunition in the hands of the US pro-Taiwan lobby. \"We should give back the plane and its crew and show compassion,\" argued one contributor to the People's Daily website. \"Our main task is to prevent Taiwan from getting advanced weaponry from the US.\" President Jiang Zemin, too, indicated yesterday that he still hopes the US-China relationship will return to a normal track. All his advisers have been urging him to give President George Bush the benefit of the doubt in spite of the anti-China noises from the new US administration. Mr Gao, the strategic analyst, said that public opinion was a short-term factor, but that the government would be more guided by the need to takea long-term view on policy towards the US. But the spy plane crisis is putting such moderation under immense strain. The existence of a US surveillance programme against China - though well known in government and military circles - has now entered the public domain in one dramatic stroke. Popular newspapers have published details - taken directly from the US media - of the capabilities and crew of the EP-3 aircraft, and of its spying operations against China. Having made the demand that such missions should stop, will Beijing pretend nothing is happening if they go on? The US claim that it was over international waters has not gone down well at the official or popular level, though Beijing admits the US plane was not in Chinese airspace. Washington's image has also suffered from its failure to express sadness over the missing Chinese airman who must now be presumed dead. The pilot was named yesterday as Wang Wei. Chinese news agencies reported that he had parachuted out of his F-8 jet after the collision but he has not been found. But the Chinese media have made a point of stressing Mr Jiang's concern about the pilot - which also took some time to emerge. Beijing's case now includes complex but significant arguments about the legality of the US spy flights. Mr Zhu argued that although the collision did not happen in Chinese airspace, it was over an \"exclusive economic zone\" which Beijing claims in the South China sea - a territorial claim that is disputed in the region. He argued that while UN law allows peaceful transit over such areas this did not cover spying activities. He also revealed that the US and China had reached an agreement last year on \"avoiding military risks in sea areas\" - which the US had now violated. The Chinese are arch-negotiators, but they are angry and not inclined to roll over to what they call US hegemonism.

      "bodyText": "The regions hardest hit by the foot and mouth epidemic are already among those most at the mercy of economic downturns, according to a new report. The Countryside Agency's third annual audit of the state of the countryside found that remote parts of Cumbria, Northumberland and the south-west rank among the most deprived rural areas in England. Their dependence on a combination of farming and tourism has made them particularly vulnerable to the effects of the foot and mouth outbreak, the report said. Ewen Cameron, chairman of the agency and a member of the rural taskforce tackling the consequences of the outbreak, yesterday called for more investment to broaden the economic base of remote rural areas, warning: \"Their economies and communities are already fragile and now in many of these areas foot and mouth has devastated farming and tourism, with little other business to cushion the blow.\" Improved communications infrastructure, including fast broadband links to areas such as the Lake District, could encourage the growth of new IT companies, creating a \"Silicon Lakes\", Mr Cameron said. He called on the chancellor, Gordon Brown, to offer tax breaks to people wanting to invest in their own rural businesses. At the launch of the report, the environment minister, Michael Meacher, acknowledged the special needs of businesses in the northern Lakes, one of the epidemic's worst blackspots. But while the report highlighted the depth of deprivation in some rural areas, it found that for most countryside dwellers the picture was \"relatively happy\". In general, people living in rural England enjoyed better levels of income, health and education and lower crime levels than those in urban areas. But the prognosis for agriculture remained bleak, with the industry's direct contribution to the economy falling to its lowest level for 25 years in 2000 - just \u00a37,800 a head of population.

      "bodyText": "When the Queen delivered her speech to the House of Lords last December spelling out the government's plans for the next parliamentary session, very few MPs expected more than a smattering of the 15 bills to complete the trek through both chambers and gain royal assent before a general election. As with all pre-election legislative programmes, the Queen's speech was packed with eye-catching, headline-grabbing measures on issues such as the yob culture and benefit fraud. The prime minister's decision to put back a general election to June 7 means that instead of dissolving parliament by Thursday this week for a May 3 election, MPs and peers are now faced with more space than they bargained for in their legislative programme. However, with parliament breaking up next week for a two week Easter recess, there will be little more than a fortnight's extra time to push through bills, before May 14 - the latest date that parliament can be dissolved for a June 7 general election. First, the home secretary, Jack Straw, must get through emergency legislation to delay the local elections in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. With cross party support, that could be done in two days - however, Conservatives are now calling for the local elections to be postponed indefinitely, and could thereby hold up legislation in the Lords if they wished. But because the leader of the house, Margaret Beckett, decides each Thursday the business for the following week, which bills the government will press ahead with remains to be seen. They could push ahead with the hunting bill, but with the Lords having voted against it in large numbers last month, and the foot and mouth crisis in the countryside, Mr Blair may leave the bill to die. Similarly, Mr Straw's bill to restrict trail by jury may be thought too controversial to be in the headlines just before the campaign. Thus the options facing the prime minister, and his advisers, on which bills to push, are almost as delicately poised as the decision to delay the election itself. This is the current state of play of all 15 pieces of legislation unveiled in the Queen's speech: Finance bill Puts into effect the chancellor's March budget. Commons second reading April 9. \u0095 Minister in charge: Stephen Timms Criminal justice and police bill Raises child curfew age to 16, fixed penalty notices for public disorder, powers to close rowdy pubs and arrest kerb crawlers.

British broadcasters are getting a first look at the hotly anticipated show - created by Matt Stone and Trey Parker - at the MipTV programming market in Cannes this week. Sky One and Channel 4, which already broadcast South Park, are understood to be interested in That's My Bush, along with the BBC and Channel 5. That's My Bush stars Timothy Bottoms and Carrie Quinn Dolin as a bumbling George Bush and his sensible First Lady Laura. But the show is more concerned with parodying 1970s sitcoms such as Benson than offering biting political satire. The show features over-the-top applause and laughter from a fake studio audience. However, That's My Bush also contains the gross-out Stone/Parker humour that made South Park such a controversial hit. The first episode includes an appearance by an aborted pro-lifer, who has managed to survive in the form of angry foetus puppet. That's My Bush premieres on US cable channel Comedy Central this week. The US broadcaster has brought seven 30-minute episodes of the show to Cannes and is expecting to wrap up a deal with a UK broadcaster within weeks.",

Executives at the company say they are astounded by the alleged similarities between Popstars and Pop Idol and are talking to their lawyers. ITV commissioned Pop Idol last month following the runaway success of Popstars, which has launched the careers of the five wannabes selected through the TV show for the group Hear'Say. Pop Idol will also involve a TV search for new talent, but instead of a band it is seeking to launch the career of a solo artist and will allow viewers to votes for their favourites. The show is expected to be screened later this year and will be produced by Mr Lythgoe, who has just quit ITV for an executive role at 19TV, the company that will co-produce Pop Idol with Pearson TV. Pop Idol is being showcased at the MipTV programme market in Canne. Pearson TV, which developed the show, is hoping it can secure several deals to sell the format overseas. Screentime, the Australian owner of the Popstars format, and Target, its UK-based distributor, have now consulted their lawyers about potential action. \"We have come under enormous pressure from broadcasters around the world, who have seen the new Pearson format as a potential threat to their hugely successful Popstars franchise,\" a spokeswoman for the companies said. \"As a result, we are briefing our legal representatives in Sydney and London to take whatever action necessary to protect our and our broadcasting clients' interests around the world Screentime executive director Des Monaghan added: \"When we got here we were amazed about the breadth and depth of the reaction.

Sir David Ramsbotham was so disturbed by the violent culture discovered inside Stoke Heath YOI, near Market Drayton, Shropshire, that he immediately wrote to the home secretary, Jack Straw, demanding that no more children be housed in two of its wings. The damning report on yet another young offender institution contrasts sharply with a report published this week on Swinfen Hall YOI in Staffordshire, which was described as a centre of excellence. The Stoke Heath report, published today, says the level of injuries found was unprecedented, with \"assaults, fighting and violence endemic\" among the 600 inmates inside residential wings of the youth jail. It says that over an eight-month period last year some 717 acts of violence had been recorded involving injuries to the teenage inmates. There were 268 injuries caused by assaults by other inmates, a further 282 during fights, 116 from incidents of self-harm, and 95 were minor injuries from staff using control and restraint methods.

The director general of the prison service, Martin Narey, denied that Stoke Heath was either unsafe or inhumane: \"It is an establishment which has shown real evidence of weathering a period of turbulence, to regain a sense of stability and purpose.\" He said a range of proven anti-bullying measures had been introduced and the number of completed injury report forms had more than halved since the inspection last October.

We've had the ordnance survey map out on the kitchen table. The infected farm lies just over a mile south-east of us as the crow flies - or more alarmingly as the geese and seagulls fly, as we suspect the birds could be responsible for bringing foot and mouth here.</p> <p>There is another farm and a reservoir between us, and consequently we are all concentrating on our heavy lambing workload - and keeping our eyes wide open.</p> <p>More and more cases are coming up in Northumberland, seemingly in a random, pepperpot manner. Since neighbouring farms are also taken out as dangerous contacts, huge areas of the county are now empty of livestock. Many farmers - our friends and colleagues - simply have no lambing to do. Our friends, the Howards at Allendale, and the Browns, where Tigger our terrier was born, have lost their flocks and now their fields and fells lie silent and empty.</p> <p>We've another suspected case a similar distance to the east, but we are hoping this one proves to be negative. I've also heard of a previous suspected case where the ewes in a flock had eaten a straw barrier laid on an open road through their field, and this chemically laced snack caused painful mouth blisters. Luckily the tests proved negative and the sheep recovered.</p> <p>The handling of this affair on the ground is still far from satisfactory. Neighbouring farms still wait for days before being told if they are at risk and the slaughter of animals is often held up, as is the disposing of the bodies. When this is finally over, we, as an industry, want a full public inquiry.</p> <p>Meanwhile Ian, our lambing assistant, says it is so busy in the shed he feels like he's been here for a fortnight already. In fact he's done a week, with a day off on Saturday. Twenty-six sheep lambed before breakfast yesterday. I spent hours in the shed at the weekend as we had a series of slow lambs unable to suckle without assistance. I've always called these lambs \"duck eggs\" and this particular one was a classic. I spent ages feeding him on Saturday - four times from his mother, and then I still had to top him up with powdered milk. Then on Sunday morning, James found that the ewe had lain on the lamb in the night and squashed him.</p> <p>Every mule ewe that lambs in the field is brought in her own individual pen. We make sure they have a water bucket, hay to eat and clean straw. Their lambs are checked within the first few hours to make sure they have suckled, and help is given if they have not.</p> <p>We check every lamb each evening in case we've missed a hungry one, and we spray strong iodine solution on their navels to help them heal and to prevent infection. Within the first 24 hours, castration and shortening of the tails (to prevent fly-strike, when flies lay their eggs in the sheep's wool) is carried out.</p> <p>Lambs are then marked with matching numbers for twins, a letter of the alphabet for triplets and a single dot for a single lamb. This makes it easier for Graham and Peter to make sure each sheep family is properly mothered up in the evening - lost lambs are at risk overnight from predators, the cold and hunger.</p> <p>Twice a day the sheep in the shed receive concentrated food. Some ewes are so greedy, and after living here for up to five years know our system so well, that they gobble their own ration and then leap into other pens, disrupting the feeding for the rest of the flock.</p> <p>Hay and water is topped up as many times a day as we can manage - a minimum of six times. Clean straw is added to each pen at least twice a day in an effort to keep any infection away. Each little family unit remains in the shed for up to 48 hours. Then they are taken away in a two-berth trailer by Archie (our visiting shepherd) or Graham across the road and to the pasture. Each vacated pen has disinfectant powder sprinkled on the dirty bedding, more clean straw put on top and a fresh bucket of water put in.</p> <p>Dorothy, who helps us out a few hours each week, has just arrived. She had a phone call yesterday to say that we and another farm had gone down, but so far we're both still here.</p> <p>\u0095The writer and her husband run a livestock farm near Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland.

If this is compassionate conservatism, what does the other sort look like? In less than 100 days he has turned America into a pariah, made enemies of the entire world, his only friends the dirty polluters of the oil industry who put him there. His foreign non-policy is a calamity, brilliantly uniting Russia and China with gratuitous offence and threat.</p> <p>The Republican leader of the senate environment committee's last-minute cancellation of an urgent global warming meeting with the EU environment commissioner on Monday was like a cold war tactical snub from the Khrushchev era. Europe gets the message, so did an outraged Japan. The rest of the world draws instinctively together in its repudiation of the Bush Jnr White House. Through this strange global vandalism, the leader of the free world has become the rogue. Ungracious in victory, absolute power corrupting absolutely, the only super-power is morphing into an evil empire of its own.</p> <p>Where to begin on America the Horrible? Start with it tearing up the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty to install a national missile defence system, recreating a new cold war with China as No 1 enemy. North Korean \"sunshine\" detente is over. NDM only gives the US an illusion of invulnerability in a world it makes more dangerous. World trade negotiations were wrecked by US self- interest. Not a cent has been paid of the US promised $600m for third world debt-relief. While US wealth soared in the last decade, only 20% of its citizens gained but his budget includes a $1.6 trillion tax cut, most for the richest. The toxic Texan (he left behind the filthiest state) denies global warming and urges oil drilling in the Alaskan National Wildlife Arctic Refuge.

      "bodyText": "In his own inimitable words, let no one \"misunderestimate\" George W Bush. He is the most rightwing president in living memory. If this is compassionate conservatism, what does the other sort look like? In less than 100 days he has turned America into a pariah, made enemies of the entire world, his only friends the dirty polluters of the oil industry who put him there. His foreign non-policy is a calamity, brilliantly uniting Russia and China with gratuitous offence and threat. The Republican leader of the senate environment committee's last-minute cancellation of an urgent global warming meeting with the EU environment commissioner on Monday was like a cold war tactical snub from the Khrushchev era. Europe gets the message, so did an outraged Japan. The rest of the world draws instinctively together in its repudiation of the Bush Jnr White House. Through this strange global vandalism, the leader of the free world has become the rogue. Ungracious in victory, absolute power corrupting absolutely, the only super-power is morphing into an evil empire of its own. Where to begin on America the Horrible? Start with it tearing up the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty to install a national missile defence system, recreating a new cold war with China as No 1 enemy. North Korean \"sunshine\" detente is over. NDM only gives the US an illusion of invulnerability in a world it makes more dangerous. World trade negotiations were wrecked by US self- interest. Not a cent has been paid of the US promised $600m for third world debt-relief. While US wealth soared in the last decade, only 20% of its citizens gained but his budget includes a $1.6 trillion tax cut, most for the richest. The toxic Texan (he left behind the filthiest state) denies global warming and urges oil drilling in the Alaskan National Wildlife Arctic Refuge. He even abolished regulations limiting arsenic in drinking water and cut black-lung benefits. This richest nation on earth will never lead a redistributive global politics while so unconcerned about third world poverty among its own.

      "bodyText": "The management of Russia's main independent television station was purged yesterday in what was seen as a huge blow to media freedom in the country. In the climax to a year-long battle for control of NTV, Gazprom, the state-controlled gas corporation which owns 46% of the station, summoned an emergency meeting of NTV shareholders to remove the exiled media mogul, Vladimir Gusinsky, and his associates from its board. NTV is the key asset in Mr Gusinsky's media empire. The meeting, denounced as illegal by his associates and most of the channel's staff, resulted in Gazprom executives taking six of the nine board seats, including chairman, director, and editor-in-chief of news and current affairs. The boardroom coup raised fears that it will now join Russia's two state TV channels as Kremlin mouthpieces, meaning that the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has engineered a clean sweep of the key electronic media. Last night's flagship news bulletin on NTV was presented as a defiant swan song, the television screens marked with a logo reading \"protest\". The channel's staff lined up behind the newsreader, following a staff meeting held outside the station's studios, at which its journalists vowed to resist yesterday's takeover. Russia's best-known current affairs presenter, Yevgeny Kiselev, was sacked. Before his removal he had been NTV's director-general and editor-in-chief. In recent months he had become a high-profile standard-bearer for the free press in Russia and a trenchant opponent of the Kremlin. A controversial American businessman of Russian ancestry, Boris Jordan, replaced Mr Kiselev as head of NTV. The head of Gazprom's media subsidiary, Alfred Kokh, became chairman of the board. A candidate handpicked by Gazprom, Vladimir Kulistikov, head of the RIA state news agency, became editor-in-chief. In the past year Russia's two main state television channels had already been cajoled into providing supportive coverage of the government and the president. With a similar regime apparently beginning at NTV, the Kremlin can now savour the prospect of a clean sweep of the key electronic media. The US has complained that Mr Gusinsky was being harassed for criticising Mr Putin's policies, and on Monday the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe demanded that NTV be spared state interference. NTV journalists pinned the blame for yesterday's boardroom coup on President Putin. \"President Putin is being informed of what is going on and bears responsibility for the consequences,\" the journalists said in a statement broadcast on the channel yesterday. The aim of yesterday's board meeting was \"to establish full political control\" of the channel, they said. Gazprom, 38% owned by the state, argues that it is acting solely on financial grounds. It is trying to recoup hundreds of millions of pounds owed to it by Mr Gusinsky's businesses, and to turn a profit at NTV. The tycoon is in Spain, from where the Russian authorities are demanding his extradition on fraud charges. But in a Spanish court hearing last week, Mr Gusinsky was granted bail, suggesting that he will not be extradited. The impact of yesterday's boardroom coup could be dramatic, with NTV staff threatening to strike and further courtroom tussles inevitable. Up to 20,000 people demonstrated in Moscow last weekend in support of NTV and press freedom, denouncing Gazprom as the enforcer of the Kremlin's campaign to muzzle free speech. The television station, generally viewed as the best in Russia, has been a consistent critic of Mr Putin; its reporting of the war in Chechnya and of last year's Kursk submarine disaster particularly irked him. The takeover is likely to trigger a haemmorhaging of staff. \"NTV will survive whether they want to work with us or not,\" Mr Jordan stated bluntly as he prepared to head for the studios last night. \"I have a strict mandate from shareholders to make the company profitable.\" Gazprom,with 46% of the shares, was able to call and control yesterday's board meeting because a further 19% of the channel, and the voting rights which go with it, were frozen by a recent court ruling, giving the state gas monopoly the opening it needed. Russia's TV battles \u0095 A little more than a year ago, Oleg Dobrodeyev, an NTV founder and Putin supporter, was appointed head of RTR, Russia's second state channel; since that time the station has become an uncritical Kremlin supporter \u0095 The first state channel, ORT, has been traditionally docile.

The implicit threat of capital punishment was made yesterday by Serbia's interior minister, Dusan Mihailovic, who told reporters on a visit to Vienna: \"There are indications that Slobodan Milosevic was involved in severe criminal acts for which the death penalty is provided.\" Mr Mihailovic did not elaborate but Serbia's prime minister, Zoran Djindjic, told the Boston Globe that the former Yugoslav president would be charged within two months with ordering the murders of personal and political enemies. The jailed ex-president's close colleague, Rade Markovic, his former security chief, is already being investigated for the suspicious road accident which killed three bodyguards and the brother-in-law of Vuk Draskovic, a leading opposition politician. Mr Milosevic could be questioned and charged over that event, and also in connection with the assassination of Slavko Curuvija, the editor of a Belgrade newspaper, who was gunned down at his front door after writing a critical piece on the president. Meanwhile, President Vojislav Kostunica criticised the police operation to arrest Mr Milosevic as bungled and clumsy.

The European Union signalled yesterday that aid to Serbia could become conditional on the handover of Mr Milosevic to the Hague war crimes tribunal, though it said it would not set any deadline. Gunnar Weigand, a spokesman for the EU's external relations commissioner, Chris Patten, said that \u20ac90m (\u00a355m)-worth of aid for 2001 still had be programmed, and that its delivery would depend on \"political developments\". Jean-Jacques Joris, political adviser to the Hague prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, said that the tribunal was prepared to wait a \"few months\" for the handover, but added: \"Further cooperation is something they will also have to deliver on.

      "bodyText": "President Vladimir Putin signalled a potentially momentous shift in Russian foreign policy yesterday, choosing in future to ignore the US in favour of promoting European integration. In his annual state-of-the-nation address to both chambers of parliament in the Kremlin, Mr Putin, by adjusting his gaze to Europe, reversed decades of making Washington the priority for Moscow's foreign policy. He neglected to mention the USA at all in his passage on foreign policy, instead stressing the need for partnership between Russia and the EU. \"A course of integration with Europe will be one of the main directions of our foreign policy,\" Mr Putin stated in his one-hour speech. The new Bush administration in Washington has shown its intent to downgrade Russia as a foreign policy priority and Mr Putin responded in kind yesterday, declaring that Russia's policy should reflect the country's economic interests. He also took a sideswipe at Nato, asserting that Russia wanted to cooperate with the western alliance but only if it respected international law and observed the strictures of the UN security council. \"Unfortunately, in its decision making, this organisation ignores the views of the international community,\" he said. By contrast, he said, in its relations with the rest of the world, Russia would always be \"a trustworthy and predictable partner\". The keenly awaited speech focused mainly on Russia's domestic problems, dwelling more on diagnosing its ills than the prescriptions for their cure. Boris Nemtsov, a liberal former deputy prime minister, criticised the speech for being too vague. The thrust of Mr Putin's message was stability and continuity, with an emphasis on law and order. He spoke of the planned reforms of the judiciary, taxation, land and property rights, education, health, and pensions, without being too specific in any area. Capital was fleeing Russia at the rate of $20bn (\u00a314bn) a year because of a lack of business confidence, he said. To its detriment, the Russian economy remained dependent on raw material production and export, and serious structural reform was non-existent. The decade since the collapse of the Soviet Union, he said, had been a revolutionary time but those days were now gone. \"There will be no more revolutions or counter-revolutions.\"",

Because they took Slobodan Milosevic at his own estimation, despite all the evidence that he was a liar and a fantasist. During the Bosnian war he posed as the disinterested statesman who could bring peace, even though it was he who had instigated and prosecuted the conflict; international envoys therefore treated him as the solution rather than the problem, praising his restraint and pleading with the UN \"to keep Mr Milosevic on side\". Later, when Milosevic vowed that Nato would never get him out of Kosovo, all observers again believed him.

When Douglas Hurd was foreign secretary, he insisted that Milosevic was a man we could do business with.

(Telecom Italia bought 29%, and the other 20% was sold to the Greek company OTE.)

His willingness to part with a minority stake in Telecom Serbia did not indicate some sudden conversion to neo-liberalism; he simply needed to raise cash for the next military offensive, in Kosovo.

      "bodyText": "In a report headed Leader of struggle to free the Nuba dies, page 17, yesterday, we somehow added a zero to the number of the Nuba people of central Sudan displaced this year, making it 150,000 instead of what we intended to say, 15,000. Anna Davis, the author of a piece headed Rumour at the top, page 8 (Women), G2, yesterday, was a student on the Manchester University MA course in novel writing on which she now teaches, and not on the course at East Anglia. The mistake was ours. In our report on 2002 university entry (Chaos theory, Education page 10, March 27) our table gave AS-level scores incorrectly. An A grade at AS-level is worth 60 points, a B 50 points, a C 40 points and so on. For a full table see www.ucas.ac.uk In a report headed 'Race not issue' over accused Met officer, page 5, yesterday, we referred to \"the Googoosh, an Iranian music festival\". Googoosh is, in fact, Iran's most celebrated female pop singer. She performed at Wembley Arena in January. We spelt Isabel Hilton's name incorrectly in our index, The two-minute Guardian, page 2, yesterday. It is Isabel not Isobel. Apologies. We used the wrong photograph with a piece about D:Ream, page 15, G2 (Arts), yesterday. It showed Jamie Petrie, not Peter Cunnah. The painting of the opening of the Stockton and Darlington railway line in 1825, page 4, G2, April 2, which appeared without credit and in addition was reversed was, in fact, by Terence Cuneo. It is signed and dated bottom right (or backwards bottom left in our version): Cuneo, Dec 1949. Thanks to the artist's daughter, Carole Cuneo.

Martin Andrews, the finance director, said job losses were not being considered at the moment. </p> <p>\"We are looking at the cost base very, very hard, but people are an important resource and we don't intend to cut back on our people,\" Mr Andrews said. </p> <p>The company, which floated in 1996 to raise money for expansion into the US, was due to break even by 2001, but said another loss was now likely. Cuts are planned in pre-sales and advertising costs. According to Mr Andrews, the company has enough cash to trade through the bear market. He would not comment on how much money the company has left or how long it was likely to last. Recognition Systems had \u00a313m in the bank in September 2000. </p> <p>\u0095 Gameplay yesterday said it has been holding \"informal discussions\" with unnamed companies about its future. </p> <p>In February the online games retailer dismissed a third of its staff, shut its UK stores and split the group into two operating units - boxed games and technology - in a restructuring to push it to profitability. It has appointed Commerzbank Securities to help review options. </p> <p>The board expressed the belief that the current market valuation \"does not reflect the true underlying performance or potential of Gameplay\". </p> <p>The shares - which have underperformed the FTSE 100 by 88% in the past six months - fell 7p to 17p.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Recognition Systems yesterday added its name to the list of technology companies warning that profits are being hit by the slowdown in the US market. The Birmingham business, which develops and sells customer relationship management software and systems, said revenue for the year to the end of September would be hit by the slowdown in the US and saw its shares drop 77p to 37.5p. Recognition, which has almost a third of its 145 staff in the US, added that it had seen a delay in purchases of its software by clients attempting to conserve cash. \"Recognition Systems' recent expansion in the UK, Australia and the Far East has progressed over the past 18 months but growth from these regions is unlikely to be sufficient to offset the current slowdown in the US market,\" the company said. Analysts now expect revenues for the full year to be around \u00a313m instead of the anticipated \u00a319m. The company emphasised that revenue for the six months to the end of March was expected to be in line with market expectations of \u00a36.5m. Martin Andrews, the finance director, said job losses were not being considered at the moment. \"We are looking at the cost base very, very hard, but people are an important resource and we don't intend to cut back on our people,\" Mr Andrews said. The company, which floated in 1996 to raise money for expansion into the US, was due to break even by 2001, but said another loss was now likely. Cuts are planned in pre-sales and advertising costs. According to Mr Andrews, the company has enough cash to trade through the bear market. He would not comment on how much money the company has left or how long it was likely to last. Recognition Systems had \u00a313m in the bank in September 2000. \u0095 Gameplay yesterday said it has been holding \"informal discussions\" with unnamed companies about its future. In February the online games retailer dismissed a third of its staff, shut its UK stores and split the group into two operating units - boxed games and technology - in a restructuring to push it to profitability. It has appointed Commerzbank Securities to help review options. The board expressed the belief that the current market valuation \"does not reflect the true underlying performance or potential of Gameplay\". The shares - which have underperformed the FTSE 100 by 88% in the past six months - fell 7p to 17p.",

      "body": "<p>The countryside is in crisis and farming is on its knees. Prices for produce are being driven ever lower. Local shops are disappearing as farmers sell up and agricultural workers move to the town in search of a better living. Those who stay are relying on money from the public purse to augment their wage. Church congregations are falling. No one can see a way out of this decline. </p> <p>It is the 1840s, and it's the 1820s. It is also the 1750s, and many other points in history as far back as you care to go. The countryside has a past as chequered with change as any town or industrial area. But the idea of the country as a place of stability and continuity is the one constant thing about it, and one of its most ardent believers was one Benjamin Brecknell Turner (1815-1894) - businessman and townie incarnate, who lived most of his life in the Haymarket, central London. </p> <p>Turner's lucrative soap- and candle-manufacturing firm gave him the money to buy a licence to use one of Henry Fox Talbot's photographic cameras; and he had the time to travel around England by means of another new invention, the railways. The astonishing results of Turner's country excursions are now on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum - 60 photographs taken between 1852 and 1854 of English rural life, ruined abbeys and castles and tottering Tudor buildings. The large (11in by 16in) paper prints feature barns, cottages, rutted lanes, hedgerows, knotty, sculptural trees and farmyards artfully strewn with agricultural paraphernalia, and in none of them does the 19th century intrude. Carts, ploughs, barrels, fences, ladders are all ruggedly hand-crafted, with no smooth edge of machine-manufacture in sight. So the barbed wire in the picture Scotch Firs, Hawkhurst, comes as a surprise. It's a shot that captures textures so brilliantly your hands prickle with imaginary splinters from the firs' bark or the unvarnished palings in the foreground. Turner's loyalty to paper negatives, as most other early practitioners went over to glass negatives, helped to enhance the textural qualities he was exploring: the image seeped into the paper, instead of sitting on top of a hard surface. </p> <p>By excluding the present, Turner was presenting a vision of eternal England; but his work is much more than some crass attempt at oaks'n'yokels nationalism. They are also worlds away from the revolting mawkishness of many early photographic efforts at pastoral - winsome wives and children dressed as gypsies and posed in a sylvan setting. One third of his album Photographic Views From Nature (the single copy is held by the V&amp;A) features the Worcestershire village of Bredicot, and its quietly crumbling wattle-and-daub, clapboard and thatch buildings seem to be dozing their way through an eternal summer afternoon. </p> <p>This no-time, all-time quality of Turner's work derives partly from the near absence of shadows - a result of the paper negative's inability to render half-tones as well as the rival glass process. The utter stillness of this world reflects the windless conditions required in an age when exposure times were 30 minutes to one hour (and Turner had to spend the same amount of time developing the image on the spot in his portable tent-darkroom).

      "bodyText": "The countryside is in crisis and farming is on its knees. Prices for produce are being driven ever lower. Local shops are disappearing as farmers sell up and agricultural workers move to the town in search of a better living. Those who stay are relying on money from the public purse to augment their wage. Church congregations are falling. No one can see a way out of this decline. It is the 1840s, and it's the 1820s. It is also the 1750s, and many other points in history as far back as you care to go. The countryside has a past as chequered with change as any town or industrial area. But the idea of the country as a place of stability and continuity is the one constant thing about it, and one of its most ardent believers was one Benjamin Brecknell Turner (1815-1894) - businessman and townie incarnate, who lived most of his life in the Haymarket, central London. Turner's lucrative soap- and candle-manufacturing firm gave him the money to buy a licence to use one of Henry Fox Talbot's photographic cameras; and he had the time to travel around England by means of another new invention, the railways. The astonishing results of Turner's country excursions are now on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum - 60 photographs taken between 1852 and 1854 of English rural life, ruined abbeys and castles and tottering Tudor buildings. The large (11in by 16in) paper prints feature barns, cottages, rutted lanes, hedgerows, knotty, sculptural trees and farmyards artfully strewn with agricultural paraphernalia, and in none of them does the 19th century intrude. Carts, ploughs, barrels, fences, ladders are all ruggedly hand-crafted, with no smooth edge of machine-manufacture in sight. So the barbed wire in the picture Scotch Firs, Hawkhurst, comes as a surprise. It's a shot that captures textures so brilliantly your hands prickle with imaginary splinters from the firs' bark or the unvarnished palings in the foreground. Turner's loyalty to paper negatives, as most other early practitioners went over to glass negatives, helped to enhance the textural qualities he was exploring: the image seeped into the paper, instead of sitting on top of a hard surface. By excluding the present, Turner was presenting a vision of eternal England; but his work is much more than some crass attempt at oaks'n'yokels nationalism. They are also worlds away from the revolting mawkishness of many early photographic efforts at pastoral - winsome wives and children dressed as gypsies and posed in a sylvan setting. One third of his album Photographic Views From Nature (the single copy is held by the V&amp;A) features the Worcestershire village of Bredicot, and its quietly crumbling wattle-and-daub, clapboard and thatch buildings seem to be dozing their way through an eternal summer afternoon. This no-time, all-time quality of Turner's work derives partly from the near absence of shadows - a result of the paper negative's inability to render half-tones as well as the rival glass process. The utter stillness of this world reflects the windless conditions required in an age when exposure times were 30 minutes to one hour (and Turner had to spend the same amount of time developing the image on the spot in his portable tent-darkroom). There is never any indi cation of what time of day or atmospheric conditions each shot shows: the bleached-out skies were another feature of choosing paper over glass, but there is evidence that Turner manipulated the negative to block out features from his skies to ensure vast empty heavens. And where is everybody? It's like coming upon an abandoned village, with the objects that were left behind caught on the point of returning to the materials from which they were crafted by fleeting, disruptive humankind. Always out of shot in the Bredicot pictures is the railway, which passed right behind one of his favourite subjects, Bredicot Court, from 1840, pumping steam across its farmyard; and there is no reference whatever to the massive structural changes brought by the enclosure of local farmlands in 1846.

      "body": "<p>Akram Khan is widely regarded as one of the most original and charismatic artists to arrive on the UK dance scene in ages, and has a slew of awards to prove it. The only problem with this 26-year-old prodigy is that no one quite knows how to define him. While he is prized within the South Asian dance community as a leading exponent of Kathak (the classical style of north India), he's also claimed by the modern dance world as one of its most interesting new choreographers. As for audiences, they can rarely be sure whether Khan's shows will feature pure Indian classicism or experimental choreography with a tough urban edge. </p> <p>Yet Khan never deliberately chose to be a maverick nor even specifically to be a dancer. He grew up as an ordinary kid in Balham, London, and his career kind of happened along the way. It was his mother who prompted Khan to attend his first dance class at the age of seven. She had been passionate about dance while she was growing up in Bangladesh but her father had disapproved, and she'd had to learn in secret. When she moved to London she was determined her own children shouldn't be similarly deprived, so Khan was sent to study with the great dancer and teacher Sri Pratap Pawar. </p> <p>Looking back, Khan remembers that this was OK by him, but that he felt no fierce sense of vocation, complaining \"when lessons stopped me from watching my favourite programmes on TV\". He also seems to have been pretty casual about the first big professional break in his life, which was being cast for Peter Brook's production of Ma habharata at the age of 14. Khan had been talent-spotted by one of Brook's scouts and after auditioning \"with loads of Rada boys\" had been offered a year and a half's contract to tour the world. </p> <p>But while the experience was \"amazing\", Khan wasn't remotely awed by Brook himself, who struck him as a somewhat \"annoying old man\" because he insisted on delivering all his stage corrections in a barely audible voice. \"Every time he wanted to talk to you, you had to stop what you were doing and go right up to where he was sitting.\" Nor did Khan appreciate how many of his fellow actors were actually \"gods of their profession. The adults were really kind to me but I used to laugh at the way they competed to become my mentor. They'd take me aside to give me private acting classes, and they all wanted to teach me different things because they came from all over the world and had different styles.\" </p> <p>Khan may not have been star-struck by Brook but he was profoundly moved when, shortly after his return, Pratap Pawar invited him to become his disciple. This is a bond almost like father and son, which bestows on the disciple the rights to his guru's skills and artistic creations, while binding him to honour them in return. Pratap Pawar trained Khan to give his first solo recital at the Commonwealth Institute when he was 18, and in doing so nudged him inexorably towards a professional career. </p> <p>His mother, ironically, was growing nervous at her son's success and tried to persuade him to get some kind of university qualification. Khan agreed but only so far as to sign up for a degree in dance studies. The course was based in modern dance, a genre of which Khan knew nothing, and he certainly felt himself an oddity. While he had more training and stage experience than most of his peers, his Kathak style kept interfering with his attempts to master the shapes and dynamics of western dance - to the irritation of his teachers. Similarly, his exposure to modern dance began to influence his Kathak dancing, to the considerable annoyance of his guru. </p> <p>But Khan himself became curious about the conflict going on in his body: \"I wanted to investigate what it was that was annoying other people and frustrating me.\" He started to explore how the percussive rhythms of Kathak's footwork, the virtuoso speed of its turns and the expressiveness of its gestures could be articulated differently through the more full-bodied action of modern styles. He started to understand how the logic of classicism could relate to the \"chaos\" of modern dance structure in which \"a movement can take any route you choose between A and B\". At the end of his final year (when he'd transferred to the Northern College of Contemporary Dance) he'd not only invented his own style, but graduated with the highest marks ever awarded there. </p> <p>His examiners knew what they were doing. Khan is a big, graceful dancer who is capable of both arresting stillness and galvanic speed, and whether he's dancing classical or modern he holds the stage as if it were his personal domain. He can concentrate the air around him in a heroic freeze frame or thresh it into chaos with the ferocity of his spins and the drastic changes of his body's momentum. He plays with tension, tenderness and danger as if he were making up the story of his life on stage. </p> <p>Since college, Khan's career has moved on a steep upward curve. He's toured several new works, choreographed a film for Channel 4, and been appointed choreographer in residence at the South Bank Centre. This autumn he presents a group piece to music by Magnus Lindberg in a programme involving the London Sinfonietta and artist Bill Viola. </p> <p>At first his guru was \"apprehensive\" about Khan's apparent defection from tradition (although he's now \"very supportive\") and there have been other members of the South Asian community who continue to be critical of his modern tendencies. Like all groups living a long way from home, this small dance world clings fast to its own culture. Yet while Khan is reluctant to discuss his position within that community, he does comment that when he performed his contemporary work in India, classicists there were very enthusiastic: \"They didn't see it as a betrayal of Kathak but as a new interpretation.\" </p> <p>And even though modern dance has left its marks all over Khan's body, he still studies and performs Kathak, and his new solo show, Polaroid Feet, is very much in classical mode. Performing with a live ensemble of musicians, Khan will not only display the brilliance of his dancing, he will also flaunt the brilliance of his ear as he and the band launch into the flights of improvisation traditional to Kathak. Dancer and musicians bounce rhythms off each other, building up increasingly complex variations within basic metric cycles. It's a jousting of wills and nerve that produces vertiginous fun for the audience as well as the performers. It's jazz and The Weakest Link rolled into one. </p> <p>As an artist, Khan says he will always return to Kathak as his base. \"I need to keep picking the fruits of classicism,\" he says. As a disciple, he also sees it as his duty. \"There are so few male Kathak soloists performing here. I don't want to see the dance dying out.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Akram Khan is at the Purcell Room, London SE1 (020-7960 4242), from April 8-10.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Annie Castledine is one of the arts world's best-known secrets. As a director she has a genius for doing work that is unfashionable - so much so that she once lost her job because of it - yet she has shaped some of the most influential players in British theatre. Over the past 15 years she has had a major role in the careers and productions of Stephen Daldry, Simon McBurney, Neil Bartlett and Kathryn Hunter, to name but a few. </p> <p>Back in 1981, when the young Daldry landed the artistic directorship of the Gate, the first person he turned to was Castledine. Together they directed the Ingolstadt plays, which became Daldry's calling card in London and established him as a major player. In recent years McBurney's Theatre de Complicite has seldom opened a show before letting Castledine take a look at it. Then there are designers. An entire generation, including Ian McNeil, Rurai Murchison and Antony Ward, had their first big breaks with Castledine when she was artistic director of Derby Playhouse between 1987-90. Her brief reign has passed into legend, not least for her refusal to pander to the bums-on-seats marketing mantra that was sweeping the regional reps. \"I hadn't realised regional rep was about money. I thought it was about encouraging the young and being radical,\" she says. </p> <p>Castledine did what she has always done and produced work that she found interesting. \"As much as anything, I direct for my own personal growth. I am driven by a curiosity to see what can and cannot be achieved,\" she says. She was one of the first to introduce a European aesthetic on a regional stage and outraged the local populace by casting a black actress as Amanda in a revival of Coward's Private Lives long before colour-blind casting was the norm. The local press was hostile and, perhaps not surpris ingly, it was Castledine's head that was demanded by the council as the price of underwriting the theatre's deficit. </p> <p>That should have been the end of Castledine's brief but brilliant career. But losing Derby actually turned out to be the best thing that could have happened to her. Over the last 10 years, while the regional repertory system has gone into decline, Castledine has been involved in creating and developing an impressive body of work. She has been associate director with Complicite on The Winter's Tale and The Caucasian Chalk Circle and she has initiated such projects as Goliath, Bryony Lavery's soul-searching adaptation of Beatrix Campbell's book about life on Britain's sink estates. Her most recent project is a production of Bertolt Brecht's The Mother for London's BAC. With her typical flair for the contrary, this is a play set in a time when politics was a matter of life and death rather than spin-doctoring. As Castledine says: \"When a play seems most inappropriate it is often the time to do it.\" </p> <p>At 62, Castledine has become one of the most energising and dynamic talents in the business. She was always a late starter. The daughter of a Sheffield colliery engineer, she was brought up in a family where the only reason you got let off housework was if you were reading a book. She went to the local grammar school, where she was a bright but disruptive element until she was cast in the school play at the age of 13. She says that the experience socialised her, but since in those days girls of her background were only expected to become nurses or teachers, the idea of making theatre her life never crossed her mind. </p> <p>It was only at 35, after many years of teaching, that Castledine turned to the theatre after going to York University as a mature student. There she spent most of her time directing plays and her talent was spotted by Michael Winter, the then director of the Theatre Royal, who offered her the chance to be his arts council trainee. </p> <p>She has never looked back despite being \"a self-educated, self-made person\" who entered the profession at a time when most directors were still Oxbridge-educated men (a situation that has changed rather less than one might have predicted). When she was a student teacher at Goldsmiths, Honor Matthews, the head of drama, took the young Castledine under her wing, recognising in her something beyond \"the raw barbarian down from the hills\". Perhaps that is the key to all Castledine's work that combines an English working-class and feminist toughness tempered by a lyric, European sensibility. It explains so much why the love affair with Complicite has developed into an enduring marriage and why they have been so good for each other. </p> <p>Castledine once described her greatest heroine as being Antigone, the great refusenik. It is an appropriate image for a woman who battles on, creating work she really cares about and who is so seldom feted or rewarded and has sometimes been completely ignored.

      "bodyText": "Annie Castledine is one of the arts world's best-known secrets. As a director she has a genius for doing work that is unfashionable - so much so that she once lost her job because of it - yet she has shaped some of the most influential players in British theatre. Over the past 15 years she has had a major role in the careers and productions of Stephen Daldry, Simon McBurney, Neil Bartlett and Kathryn Hunter, to name but a few. Back in 1981, when the young Daldry landed the artistic directorship of the Gate, the first person he turned to was Castledine. Together they directed the Ingolstadt plays, which became Daldry's calling card in London and established him as a major player. In recent years McBurney's Theatre de Complicite has seldom opened a show before letting Castledine take a look at it. Then there are designers. An entire generation, including Ian McNeil, Rurai Murchison and Antony Ward, had their first big breaks with Castledine when she was artistic director of Derby Playhouse between 1987-90. Her brief reign has passed into legend, not least for her refusal to pander to the bums-on-seats marketing mantra that was sweeping the regional reps. \"I hadn't realised regional rep was about money. I thought it was about encouraging the young and being radical,\" she says. Castledine did what she has always done and produced work that she found interesting. \"As much as anything, I direct for my own personal growth. I am driven by a curiosity to see what can and cannot be achieved,\" she says. She was one of the first to introduce a European aesthetic on a regional stage and outraged the local populace by casting a black actress as Amanda in a revival of Coward's Private Lives long before colour-blind casting was the norm. The local press was hostile and, perhaps not surpris ingly, it was Castledine's head that was demanded by the council as the price of underwriting the theatre's deficit. That should have been the end of Castledine's brief but brilliant career. But losing Derby actually turned out to be the best thing that could have happened to her. Over the last 10 years, while the regional repertory system has gone into decline, Castledine has been involved in creating and developing an impressive body of work. She has been associate director with Complicite on The Winter's Tale and The Caucasian Chalk Circle and she has initiated such projects as Goliath, Bryony Lavery's soul-searching adaptation of Beatrix Campbell's book about life on Britain's sink estates. Her most recent project is a production of Bertolt Brecht's The Mother for London's BAC. With her typical flair for the contrary, this is a play set in a time when politics was a matter of life and death rather than spin-doctoring. As Castledine says: \"When a play seems most inappropriate it is often the time to do it.\" At 62, Castledine has become one of the most energising and dynamic talents in the business. She was always a late starter. The daughter of a Sheffield colliery engineer, she was brought up in a family where the only reason you got let off housework was if you were reading a book. She went to the local grammar school, where she was a bright but disruptive element until she was cast in the school play at the age of 13. She says that the experience socialised her, but since in those days girls of her background were only expected to become nurses or teachers, the idea of making theatre her life never crossed her mind. It was only at 35, after many years of teaching, that Castledine turned to the theatre after going to York University as a mature student. There she spent most of her time directing plays and her talent was spotted by Michael Winter, the then director of the Theatre Royal, who offered her the chance to be his arts council trainee. She has never looked back despite being \"a self-educated, self-made person\" who entered the profession at a time when most directors were still Oxbridge-educated men (a situation that has changed rather less than one might have predicted). When she was a student teacher at Goldsmiths, Honor Matthews, the head of drama, took the young Castledine under her wing, recognising in her something beyond \"the raw barbarian down from the hills\". Perhaps that is the key to all Castledine's work that combines an English working-class and feminist toughness tempered by a lyric, European sensibility. It explains so much why the love affair with Complicite has developed into an enduring marriage and why they have been so good for each other. Castledine once described her greatest heroine as being Antigone, the great refusenik. It is an appropriate image for a woman who battles on, creating work she really cares about and who is so seldom feted or rewarded and has sometimes been completely ignored. She has no regrets. \"Theatre has been very good to me. It has been an embrace, it has supported me and allowed me to do the work I've really wanted to do. I am not really an Antigone. I really wouldn't have the courage. You know, Brecht wrote a poem about Antigone. It ends: 'And over their atrocities there grew no grass.' That's beautiful, but no, I'd never have the courage. The cost is just too high.\" \u0095 The Mother is at BAC, London SW11 (020-7223 2223), until April 22.",

      "bodyText": "The Mona Lisa was moved to temporary lodgings yesterday as work started on a room of her own that will allow a few more of the Louvre's 6m visitors a year to see her. From today, the world's best-known painting will be displayed in the museum's Rosa gallery while workmen divide her overcrowded former home, the Salle d'Etats, in two to create a special 200 sq metre Mona Lisa room. The \u00a32.5m revamp, which is designed by the architect Lorenzo Piqueras and funded by Nippon Television of Japan in the largest corporate gift ever made in France for a cultural project, should be finished by 2003. Over the past 500 years, Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic masterpiece has survived moves between various French kings' palaces and, more recently, voyages to America and Japan in the 20th century. She even went missing for two years in 1911, when a patriotic Italian tried to smuggle her back to her native land. But her latest trip - just down the corridor - will be a big relief to all those who have left the Salle d'Etats disap pointed and frustrated after being unable to catch more than a distant glimpse of the painting over the milling throng of tourists. The Louvre has ruled out taking advantage of the move to restore the work, rejecting the arguments of several international art historians who say the many yellowed layers of varnish applied over the centuries prevent viewers seeing the Mona Lisa as Da Vinci intended when he completed the painting in 1506. Jean-Pierre Cuzin, the museum's chief curator of paintings, said restoration would be technically feasible but was unnecessary and could do irreparable damage. \"In any case, she isn't as yellowed as all that,\" he said. \"Once she's in her new room and properly lit, you'll see a different painting.\"",

      "bodyText": "At the end of what is expected to be Germany's last big Nazi war crimes trial, a court yesterday convicted an 83-year-old former SS officer of the murder of seven Jewish concentration camp inmates. Julius Viel, whom the prosecution dubbed \"Lord of Life and Death\" at the Theresien stadt camp, was jailed for 12 years despite the prosecution's request for a life sentence. Judge Hermann Winkler said consideration had to be given to the length of time that had elapsed between the crime and the verdict. The court's leniency will make little difference to Viel, a retired and respected postwar German journalist, who says he is suffering from cancer and will probably die behind bars. Viel said after the verdict: \"I'm sorry for the sake of my wife.\" The trial reignited the debate over whether reliable verdicts can be reached on the basis of testimony about events more than half-a-century old. The defendant had been investigated for the murders in the 1960s, but the case was closed for lack of evidence. At Viel's trial, there was only one substantive prosecution witness: Adalbert Lallier, a retired Canadian professor of economics, who came forward in 1998 to say that, before going to his grave, he wanted to tell the truth about an incident he had witnessed in the spring of 1945. As Soviet troops advanced across eastern Europe, Prof Lallier and other SS officer trainees were ordered to supervise the digging of a tank trap by inmates near the Theresienstadt camp in what is now the Czech Republic. It was a grisly business. At least 33 inmates died before the work was completed, most of them worked to death. Prof Lallier told the Ravensburg court, however, that the seven were shot in the space of a three- to four-minute period minutes by Viel, then an SS Untersturmf\u00fchrer, or second lieutenant. But, as the prosecution acknowledged in court, Prof Lallier's testimony was contradictory and far from complete. By the end of the trial, the court still did not know the victims' identities, the day they died or the murder weapon. Viel's lawyers plan to appeal. They argued during the trial that Viel had been in Vienna when the killings took place. They also claimed that Prof Lallier had made up his testimony to distract attention from his own Nazi past.

They had a record out in 1992. And since then? They've been working on their second album. After nine years, it's about to come out. Is that a record? Probably - they make the Stone Roses, who took five years to produce a second album, look speedy. Have they been unemployed and starving? Nope, they made sure they sold out before dropping out. Royalties from mobile phone ads using their last album's title song, Connected, have kept them in jelly babies. Is it worth the wait? Critics say they sound just like they used to. How's that? Innovative dance-wise electric funk-hop turntable pop. Who's the creative talent? Nick \"The Head\" Hallam and Rob \"Grasshopper\" Birch. They were at the forefront of what is now DJ culture. Where do they hang out, the Bronx? No, Brixton. What have they been up to in the meantime? Playing table football and recharging their batteries. They produced 400 tracks (30 or so albums' worth) they didn't like much. How come? You know what these artistes are like ... So this new effort is really polished? Er, they say it's still got rough edges, since they wanted to keep the mix \"kinda live\". It's not cool to be perfect. Are their fans still up for it? Apparently. After Connected sold 1.5m, they headlined Glastonbury and toured America, so they had a few. And recent warm-up gigs in Britain have been big sell-outs. Most likely to say: \"Turn on, tune in, take a siesta.\" Not to be confused with: the Stone Roses, the number 73 bus, Godot ...",

      "body": "<p>The Today green room, where guests wait balefully to be interviewed, is one of the world's less glamorous places. It's a ten-by-ten glass kennel with carpet tiles stolen from a Louisiana motel in 1972, a recalcitrant coffee machine and bits of croissant half-chewed by Jim Naughtie. </p> <p>And then there's the guests. </p> <p>Important, clever people who run the country; people from Select Committees and quangos, very serious businessmen and furious, radical campaigners. Interesting people, yes - but glitzy? Hard to argue, really. The glitziest we usually get is Iain Duncan Smith and that nice chap from the Soil Association. Glitzy isn't really our thing. </p> <p>But then, for a moment last week, a little stardust was sprinkled on the Today programme. At 7.15 in the morning, sitting on the strange purple sofa in our green room - between a lady from the Monetary Policy Committee and Thought For The Day - was Chrissie Hynde, who had, inexplicably, accepted our invitation to debate the rectitude or otherwise of eating meat. So I went up and said hello. </p> <p>\"Why don't you have any soya milk?\" she asked, as an opener, looking disdainfully at the breakfast spread. My usual response - \"because only mad people drink it\" - dissolved on this occasion and instead I just grinned like an imbecile. </p> <p>Then, having inquired as to whether Antony Worral Thompson, her co-debator, was \"a fox\", she asked what the name of the show was. \"It's the Today programme\", I said, and the disdain increased. </p> <p>\"Never heard it. Don't like hearing other people's opinions in the morning. I listen to Radio Three.\" </p> <p>Ah, but she's a star. And they're so few and far between round here. We had Cliff Richard on ages ago and The World Tonight once got an interview with Sir Paul McCartney (on the excellent pretext that he'd recorded a song called \"The World Tonight\". This made us briefly consider changing our name to \"I Should Be So Lucky, Lucky, Lucky, Lucky\", and then banging in a request for Kylie.) But it doesn't happen often. </p> <p>Chrissie proved it could be done, though. And the following day, the interview requests went in: David Bowie on foot and mouth disease; Ronaldo on the date of the general election; Sarah Michelle Geller on Railtrack's poor share results. But they all said no. Maybe we're not cut out for that sort of journalism. </p> <p>A few years ago we interviewed Julie Goodyear - that's Bet Lynch - who had just been made an Ambassador for Liverpool, or something. She wasn't very familiar with the programme either. Who'll be doing the interview, she asked, and when we told her John Humphrys, replied: \"Ooh, the John Humphrys? Brilliant! I love him! He's fantastic! Is he still doing Are You Being Served?\" </p> <p>\u0095 Rod Liddle is the editor of Radio 4's Today programme</p>",

It's a ten-by-ten glass kennel with carpet tiles stolen from a Louisiana motel in 1972, a recalcitrant coffee machine and bits of croissant half-chewed by Jim Naughtie. And then there's the guests. Important, clever people who run the country; people from Select Committees and quangos, very serious businessmen and furious, radical campaigners. Interesting people, yes - but glitzy? Hard to argue, really. The glitziest we usually get is Iain Duncan Smith and that nice chap from the Soil Association. Glitzy isn't really our thing. But then, for a moment last week, a little stardust was sprinkled on the Today programme. At 7.15 in the morning, sitting on the strange purple sofa in our green room - between a lady from the Monetary Policy Committee and Thought For The Day - was Chrissie Hynde, who had, inexplicably, accepted our invitation to debate the rectitude or otherwise of eating meat. So I went up and said hello. \"Why don't you have any soya milk?\" she asked, as an opener, looking disdainfully at the breakfast spread. My usual response - \"because only mad people drink it\" - dissolved on this occasion and instead I just grinned like an imbecile. Then, having inquired as to whether Antony Worral Thompson, her co-debator, was \"a fox\", she asked what the name of the show was. \"It's the Today programme\", I said, and the disdain increased. \"Never heard it. Don't like hearing other people's opinions in the morning. I listen to Radio Three.\" Ah, but she's a star. And they're so few and far between round here. We had Cliff Richard on ages ago and The World Tonight once got an interview with Sir Paul McCartney (on the excellent pretext that he'd recorded a song called \"The World Tonight\". This made us briefly consider changing our name to \"I Should Be So Lucky, Lucky, Lucky, Lucky\", and then banging in a request for Kylie.) But it doesn't happen often. Chrissie proved it could be done, though. And the following day, the interview requests went in: David Bowie on foot and mouth disease; Ronaldo on the date of the general election; Sarah Michelle Geller on Railtrack's poor share results. But they all said no. Maybe we're not cut out for that sort of journalism. A few years ago we interviewed Julie Goodyear - that's Bet Lynch - who had just been made an Ambassador for Liverpool, or something. She wasn't very familiar with the programme either. Who'll be doing the interview, she asked, and when we told her John Humphrys, replied: \"Ooh, the John Humphrys? Brilliant! I love him! He's fantastic! Is he still doing Are You Being Served?\" \u0095 Rod Liddle is the editor of Radio 4's Today programme",

Alone among the scions of the prewar dynasties that dominated Fleet Street for three-quarters of a century, he was a lifelong, fulltime newspaperman, and chairman and editor-in-chief for 30 years of the family's Daily and Sunday Telegraphs - until his dedicated, but idiosyncratic, stewardship delivered them into the hands of the Canadian entrepreneur Conrad Black in December 1985.</p> <p>The painful and humiliating circumstances in which he lost control of the two papers, to which he had devoted all his energies from the day he returned from war service, was a blow from which he never recovered.</p> <p>As Michael Berry, he took over the Daily Telegraph in 1954, when his father, the first Viscount Camrose, died, and his elder brother, succeeding to the title, opted for more gentlemanly pursuits than Fleet Street offered. Young Berry - he was 43 - arrived with all the right establishment qualifications: Eton, Christ Church, Oxford, and a wartime colonel in the artillery. He had edited the Sunday Mail in Glasgow from 1934-35, and been managing editor of the Financial Times from 1937-39.</p> <p>He was not, however, in the traditional famous-father-foolish-son mould of Beaverbrook's heir, Max Aitken. He inherited not merely a thriving, prosperous Conservative newspaper but his chapel- going forebears' capacity for hard work and single-minded enterprise. Starting with a modest magazine, the Berry brothers - two young Welshmen from Merthyr Tydfil - had built up an empire of 26 newpapers by the 1930s, when they decided to divide it, with William (Camrose) taking the Daily Telegraph, and Gomer (later Viscount Kemsley) getting the Sunday Times.</p> <p>Under Michael Berry, the Telegraph rapidly expanded its base among archetypal Tories with an editorial policy that concentrated on the most comprehensive hard news coverage of any daily - including fuller accounts of all the juiciest crimes and sex cases than the popular papers carried - but almost no feature articles. All this was primly packaged in an austere typography that became a synonym for sub- urban respectability. Yet, despite its sobriquet, the \"Torygraph\", the paper took its owner's very independent view of Conservative, and, in the lady's day, Thatcherite, policies.</p> <p>Encouraged by steadily rising sales, Berry launched the Sunday Telegraph in 1961, to split overheads and cash in on the daily's highly-profitable advertising pull. It was to prove a costly misjudgment of the market; the Sunday Telegraph kept going but became a financial millstone round the company's overstretched neck.</p> <p>Lord Hartwell - he was given a life peerage by Harold Wilson in 1968 - was a shy man with a slight stammer. He left the public spotlight to his vivacious wife, Pamela, a worthy daughter of the first Lord Birkenhead (the great advocate FE Smith), whose notable salon nurtured a generation of assorted celebrities. After her death in 1982, he became even more withdrawn from social life.</p> <p>As editor-in-chief, he put in a six-day week, working closely with the Daily Telegraph editor William (now Lord) Deedes, a former Tory minister. Both were unwilling to face the fact that their once-solid readership was dying off, and the new consumer-classes wanted something trendier. In their hands, circulation had gone from 900,000 to almost 1.5m, but was now back down to 1.2m - and still falling. In an age of changing modes and neo-Toryism, the good, grey Telegraph became even greyer, if anything, reflecting Hartwell's isolation from the wider world.</p> <p>As Peregrine Worsthorne, editor of the Sunday Telegraph for three years, put it: \"It was a boring paper, but the great thing was that it seemed to be what people wanted. It never shocked or upset readers with views they didn't like.

Poring over his beloved printer's proofs, correcting solecisms, Hartwell had failed to realise that, in modern commercial terms, the Telegraph had become a ramshackle anachronism. Plagued by costly union fiddles, with neither proper budget nor financial structure, deferential executives told him only what they thought he wanted to hear, and were themselves never taken into his confidence, even when financial crisis erupted in the spring of 1985.</p> <p>Forced to raise \u00a3105m to fund ambitious plans for new-technology printing plants in Manchester and London's Docklands - plans that had never been realistically costed - Hartwell was shattered to find that the City's ardent Tories were unwilling to put their money where their political sympathies lay.</p> <p>It was then that Andrew Knight, editor of the Economist, tipped off his friend Black, a sharp, erudite pre- dator of 41 with a finger in innumerable transatlantic pies, that the Hartwell empire could be up for grabs. Hartwell had never heard of Black but, making a lightning decision that ran counter to his record of canny procrastination, flew to New York by Concorde with a bewildered entourage to seek Black's help.</p> <p>Within 24 hours, he had done what he thought was a very smart deal with the impressive, cultured Canadian - an injection of some \u00a310m in return for 14% of the share capital. There was one fateful \"if\" clause; should more funds be needed, Black would have the option of the rights on the Berry family shares. Hartwell was confident the company would now need no more money. But it did - much more.

Tall, fine-featured and with twinkling, but piercing, blue eyes, she was good at nego-tiating, with humour, what she saw as the English obsession with class and gender.</p> <p>Thomas was part of that rich crop of quick-thinking, well-informed, grammar-school people who missed out on university largely because of the war. Part of her strength was that she never pretended to be anything other than someone who was good at solving puzzles.</p> <p>Though she painstakingly eradicated the accent with which she had been born, she was what she called, in her 1979 autobiography, A Bandsman's Daughter, upper working-class. Born Irene Ready in Feltham, Middlesex, her father had been an army clarinettist and a meter reader for the Gas Light and Coke Company. Her mother was a seamstress who worked for the department store Gorringes. Their daughter went to Ashford county grammar school, where she discovered she was good at examinations and bad at sports. \"I couldn't hit a cow's bottom with a banjo,\" she once confessed.</p> <p>She was also a useful piano player and, while still in her teens, played for concert parties - until her hair was bobbed and she could no longer pose as an infant prodigy. She worked in an Inland Revenue office after leaving school at 15, briefly tried teaching, but doubted her ability to keep pupils' interest and discipline, was married to Wesley Baldry at 19 (they divorced in 1949) and served in the fire service through the second world war.</p> <p>When Covent Garden reopened for opera after 1945, she sang in the chorus and took small roles as a light mezzo-soprano. She also met her second husband Eddie Thomas, another singer; they were married in 1950.</p> <p>She slid from grand opera into singing for ice shows, television variety programmes and, after 1955, rendering advertising jingles for the newly-established ITV. She also worked as a session musical, a chorus girl at the London Palladium and for the Black and White Minstrel Show (for which she had her face painted not black for the TV cameras, but green).</p> <p>She joined Mensa in 1961, in the days before her skill with puzzles became public. She was given an IQ rating of 160, which put her in the top 2% of its members, and encouraged her to enter Brain Of Britain. She won, and followed up her success by capturing the title Brain Of Brains the following year.</p> <p>It had taken seven years of dauntless effort to get Thomas accepted by the BBC - and even then she got her chance only because another (male) contestant had been taken ill. She kept a file of producers' letters of excuse for not giving her a chance, labelled with typically un-sour humour, Lovely Replies.</p> <p>For many years, she wrote a column in Woman And Home magazine and, in 1986, became the first patron of the Polite Society, an organisation supporting good manners. She was active in church life around her home in Chiswick, west London.</p> <p>Irene Thomas is survived by her husband, a retired teacher.</p> <p>\u0095 Irene Thomas, quiz panellist, radio and television personality, and singer, born June 28 1920; died March 27 2001</p>",

Part of her strength was that she never pretended to be anything other than someone who was good at solving puzzles. Though she painstakingly eradicated the accent with which she had been born, she was what she called, in her 1979 autobiography, A Bandsman's Daughter, upper working-class. Born Irene Ready in Feltham, Middlesex, her father had been an army clarinettist and a meter reader for the Gas Light and Coke Company. Her mother was a seamstress who worked for the department store Gorringes. Their daughter went to Ashford county grammar school, where she discovered she was good at examinations and bad at sports. \"I couldn't hit a cow's bottom with a banjo,\" she once confessed. She was also a useful piano player and, while still in her teens, played for concert parties - until her hair was bobbed and she could no longer pose as an infant prodigy. She worked in an Inland Revenue office after leaving school at 15, briefly tried teaching, but doubted her ability to keep pupils' interest and discipline, was married to Wesley Baldry at 19 (they divorced in 1949) and served in the fire service through the second world war. When Covent Garden reopened for opera after 1945, she sang in the chorus and took small roles as a light mezzo-soprano. She also met her second husband Eddie Thomas, another singer; they were married in 1950. She slid from grand opera into singing for ice shows, television variety programmes and, after 1955, rendering advertising jingles for the newly-established ITV. She also worked as a session musical, a chorus girl at the London Palladium and for the Black and White Minstrel Show (for which she had her face painted not black for the TV cameras, but green). She joined Mensa in 1961, in the days before her skill with puzzles became public. She was given an IQ rating of 160, which put her in the top 2% of its members, and encouraged her to enter Brain Of Britain. She won, and followed up her success by capturing the title Brain Of Brains the following year. It had taken seven years of dauntless effort to get Thomas accepted by the BBC - and even then she got her chance only because another (male) contestant had been taken ill. She kept a file of producers' letters of excuse for not giving her a chance, labelled with typically un-sour humour, Lovely Replies. For many years, she wrote a column in Woman And Home magazine and, in 1986, became the first patron of the Polite Society, an organisation supporting good manners. She was active in church life around her home in Chiswick, west London. Irene Thomas is survived by her husband, a retired teacher. \u0095 Irene Thomas, quiz panellist, radio and television personality, and singer, born June 28 1920; died March 27 2001",

Sources at Scotland Yard confirmed that the tests, conducted by the forensic science service after Hanratty's body was exhumed two weeks ago, were positive, and that there was a \"one in 100m chance\" that the DNA came from another person. The evidence will be central to the crown's case to the court of appeal that the conviction of Hanratty 39 years ago for the murder of Michael Gregsten is safe. The killer also raped and shot the civil servant's lover, Valerie Storie, 22. Hanratty, 25, a petty thief, went to the gallows at Bedford prison on April 4 1962 for what became known as the A6 murder. Though the DNA tests appear to be conclusive, lawyers acting for Hanratty's family said they were neither surprised by the results nor despondent about their prospects at the appeal hearing, expected this autumn. They will argue that the tests are not relevant because DNA from Hanratty's clothes that were confiscated at the time of the original investigation may have been mixed with two garments, a handkerchief and Storie's knickers, gathered from the crime scene. If the appeal court is not satisfied that the two sets of clothes were kept entirely separate, the DNA results could be deemed insignificant. The problem for both sides is that nobody knows what happened to the underwear and the handkerchief in the 30 years before they were found in a laboratory drawer in Lambeth, south London, in 1991. Doubts about the safety of the conviction led the criminal cases review commission to refer the case to the appeal court. \"We know the clothes were kept in paper envelopes and that they were brought to court at the time of the trial and examined by expert witnesses for the prosecution and the defence,\" said Tamsin Allen, a lawyer acting for Hanratty's relatives. \"We say the clothes could easily have been contaminated, so these latest DNA results have not come as a surprise.

There is no question but that a major arms conspiracy was afoot in the latter months of 1993 and up to 1994.</p> <p>\"It was Geoffrey Brennan who gave the police the information about that.

But Brennan took the money from his business account and almost immediately stopped trading, the court heard. He bought a new home with the cash and left a string of unpaid debts. Mr Latham told the jury that Brennan had then turned to the two detectives to help him concoct a cover story that would explain why he had received such a large amount of money. The smokescreen to deter any police inquiry was an undercover operation, which involved Mr Redgrave and Mr Charman, to expose gun smuggling between the US and the UK, the court heard. But when Brennan realised that officers at Bexleyheath CID were pursuing the theft - following complaints from the US businessmen - he panicked, and turned to Scotland Yard's newly formed CIB for protection. In a pre-trial abuse of process hearing, the judge heard that Brennan had confessed the scam to a CIB investigator, Superintendent Roger Gaspar, and claimed that he had paid the two detectives \u00a350,000. The interview was taped but could not be used as evidence during the trial because Brennan was not under caution. Brennan later withdrew the allegations, saying he had been coerced into making the claims about the officers. Bexleyheath police continued to investigate the theft from the Americans, and Brennan was arrested in November 1996. He denied the charge, claiming he was an informer who had been working undercover for the police, supplying officers with valuable information. Giving evidence during the trial, Brennan said the mobile shipment had been a front to import arms from Hong Kong. Andrew Trollope, defending, said Brennan had supplied information of \"the greatest import to security.\" He claimed that Brennan had given had given police \"great assistance in the war against crime. There is no question but that a major arms conspiracy was afoot in the latter months of 1993 and up to 1994. \"It was Geoffrey Brennan who gave the police the information about that. Brennan was an informant at the time and was passing on genuine information about drug trafficking... and was also passing on information about arms dealing.\" The prosecution said Brennan's involvement in covert operations only started after the theft of the money, and the complex undercover inquiries were used as cover for his crime. Sentencing Brennan, Judge Barker said: \"It has been an extraordinary case and you have clearly lived the life of deliberate risk. You have been convicted by the jury on clear evidence of an opportunistic theft. You used your connections ... to take advantage of the Wangs.\" Mr Redgrave and Mr Charman are still suspended. They have not been charged over any matter. Speaking to the Guardian last year, Mr Redgrave said: \"I have been suspended in relation to a complaint that is six years old. This has caused the complete destruction of every aspect of my personal and professional life.\" Scotland Yard refused to comment after the case.",

One, from the captain, Oto Lowe, gave a bleak technical report on their situation, ending: \"February 2, towards 1 pm, will apparently be our last hour\".</p> <p>The other, from an unnamed crew member, told a dramatic story: \"My greetings to my wife and child.

      "bodyText": "A tangle of rusty metal, on public display today for the first time, has dredged up memories of a British first world war atrocity, when the crew of an English vessel abandoned 16 German airmen to drown in the icy waters of the North Sea. The Germans had lost contact with their base at Tondern, and the truth of their deaths might have sunk with them, except for the extraordinary chance that a bottle containing their last messages was washed up on the Swedish coast six months later. The wreckage has been in government and museum stores for most of a century, since the German Zeppelin L19 crashed into the sea with her crew in February 1916, on her maiden flight. There were two notes in the bottle. One, from the captain, Oto Lowe, gave a bleak technical report on their situation, ending: \"February 2, towards 1 pm, will apparently be our last hour\". The other, from an unnamed crew member, told a dramatic story: \"My greetings to my wife and child. An English trawler was here and refused to take us on board. She was the King Stephen and hailed from Grimsby.\" By the time the bottle was found, a German U-boat had sunk the King Stephen. All the crew were rescued, interned in Germany, and returned safely to England in 1918. The tragedy became a German propaganda sensation, and was taken up in turn by the British media, which applied a radically different spin to the story. It was reported that the unamed English captain feared that since there were more German airmen than he had sailors, his vessel might be hijacked. The bishop of London fanned the flames, by commenting that leaving \"the German baby-killers\" in the water was understandable. A German newspaper said he had \"acted less as an apostle of Christian charity than as a jingoistic hate monger.\" German sources insist the captain and crew of the English vessel were blacklisted and found it hard to get work for the rest of their lives. At the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, where the salvaged wreckage will go on display today in the new London gallery, curator John Graves explained the L19 took off with an experienced crew of 16 in a convoy of 10 airships, on February 1, 1916. It was one of two which lost its bearings, and bombed civilian targets in Wednesbury, in the west Midlands, believing that they were over Liverpool. Ignominy at sea Other shameful incidents: August 19, 1915 Lieutenant Godfrey Herbert of the merchant ship Baralong sank German submarine U-27 and shot 10 survivors in the water. Some of the Germans sought refuge aboard the SS Nicosian, which had been abandoned by its crew. Herbert sent marines aboard the Nicosian who killed the four remaining survivors. September 24, 1915 HMS Baralong, renamed Wiarda, lured a German submarine U-41 into range and sank the U-boat with gunfire. After the Wiarda left the area two survivors climbed aboard an abandoned lifeboat. About three hours later the Wiarda returned and deliberately ran down the lifeboat. April 13, 1940 The British navy sank the German ship the Erich Giese. The captain Karl Smidt reported that while the crew of 200 men were in the water, British destroyers opened fire on them. May 20,1941 A convoy of 21 German ships was attacked by British warships off the coast of Crete during the night. Witnesses said the British ships scanned the sea with searchlights looking for the survivors, and opened fire on them. One survivor, Corporal Walter Segel, said: \"I saw at least 20 groups of survivors who were illuminated by the British and then sprayed with bullets.\" Laura Milne",

He admitted having felt miserable in the three weeks following the attack, but said: \"Things are now a lot better.\" Even the pain of the operations had had a positive side, he said, since he enjoyed the sensation of being put to sleep by gas. He can detect some difference between light and dark, but doctors believe it will be two years before they know if he will recover his sight. Yesterday, however, he was positive. \"What I really want now, and my dream, is to see Chelsea win the FA Cup,\" he said, while joking that another goal was to pass his driving test before his mother. \"She'd be a terrible driver and I'm sure I'll pass the test before she does.\" He added: \"I'm determined I'll see again.\".",

But he stressed that draft charging guidance was not set in stone. On the 55% of earnings rule, in particular, he acknowledged the \"many representations\" received and urged MPs to appreciate \"our willingness to reconsider whether it achieves the removal of disincentives to work\".</p>",

If you restrict help in this way, you are sending some people down the road to a scarce and very costly hospital bed.\" In a Commons adjournment debate last week, Linda Perham, Labour MP for Ilford North, raised concerns of Leonard Cheshire and other groups. Hutton replied that free personal care for all disabled and elderly people would cost an extra \u00a31bn a year and would \"do nothing to improve frontline services\". But he stressed that draft charging guidance was not set in stone. On the 55% of earnings rule, in particular, he acknowledged the \"many representations\" received and urged MPs to appreciate \"our willingness to reconsider whether it achieves the removal of disincentives to work\".",

But to go back to college at my age, late 30s, and be in a classroom and realise how out of touch you are would be very, very hard.\" </p> <p>Bagnall, who lives on a housing estate in North Tyneside, is typical of the people who are supposed to be getting online in the technological 21st century world - but find that what's on offer, in terms of formal training, just isn't going to work for them. </p> <p>Everyone knows they need computer skills in today's workplace. \"No matter which job you go for now, something has to be done with a computer. I want to work - not necessarily to be a computer whizzkid, but just have the basics.\" </p> <p>A multiplicity of government initiatives and taskforces are working on e-government, e-empowerment, e-skills and so on. The \"UK online\" campaign launched last September was intended to coordinate these, and introduced a new \"on-line network of e-learning services\", to get people with no knowledge of computers over the first hurdle. The problem is that however much they want to get over that hurdle, any association with educational institutions is going to put some people off. </p> <p>Rob Cawthron, community development officer for the Newcastle-based Home Housing Association, explains: \"On some of the estates where we work, three or four generations have been unemployed. People have been marginalised. There are all sorts of issues about exclusion, underachievement, and learning. Using the standard approach of institutions seemed a bit of a non-starter - if people felt school wasn't for them, what was the point of getting an educational institution to supply training?\" In other words, as more people overall become e-familiar, these groups will be excluded further. </p> <p>Housing associations and others are tackling this in different ways. Home Housing audited the training provision available and found that tenants wanted local, estate-based training, which wasn't necessarily directed towards a qualification. \"Lots of people just won't travel very far. We had to offer something flexible - informal learning - where you can just turn up and get used to working with computers as a useful tool rather than something to be afraid of.\" </p> <p>One way to get round the problem of fixed institutions - and meet the needs of people like Bagnall - is to use something which literally isn't fixed. Home Housing opted for training based in a \"mobile learning centre\" - a specially converted van with eight workstations and two trainers on board. The centre started on five estates where, Cawthron says, \"if it could work, and be seen to work, it could work anywhere\". A year into a three-year access and training programme, the vehicle is now working throughout the north-east, including special sessions for groups such as Asian women, excluded teenagers, and refugees and asylum seekers. It has also worked with homeless young people and with women's refuges. </p> <p>Alan Shields works for Computer Gym, a separate company which provides the training and the vehicle. Like Cawthron, he treats the project as much more than just a training exercise. In fact \"sometimes the computer side takes a bit of a back seat. People come in and have a chat for about five minutes before they actually touch a computer\". By far the most important element, he says, is building up trust and fitting into the local community. \"At the beginning, it's important to get right down to ground level, pushing leaflets through doors so that people come out and ask what you're doing. You have to make yourself known to people who wouldn't otherwise come - we often attract people by standing outside and having a chat.\" </p> <p>However, Shields is just as keen on getting local people across the digital divide. \"There's a real shortage of computer skills, especially in the north-east, so it's important that we're giving them not just a community centre, but skills they need. You've got to start showing people what to do and overcoming their lack of confidence. Even if they only spend a couple of minutes, they're really pleased with what they do and decide to come back next week.\" </p> <p>Bagnall decided to give it a go. \"The Computer Gym vehicle was on the estate where I lived, and I went in, had a look and sat down. It was just a total one-off. I went in full of trepidation, thinking: 'I'm going to make a fool of myself.' </p> <p>\"The staff started by asking me a few questions, I told them I didn't even know how to turn the machine on, and they said, 'We'll start from the basic level, then.' They didn't make me feel stupid. The hardest bit is making sure you go on a regular basis, because the tuition moves at your own pace. You have your own file and move through the programmes, but nobody pushes you through. But you also get a lot of one-to-one which you wouldn't in a classroom situation.\" </p> <p>Both Shields and Cawthron are pleased with the number of people who have come back and stuck with the training. They are also pleased both with \"hard\" results - a good number of trainees have gained formal qualifications, moved on to other courses or found work - and the \"softer\" one of overall confidence around computers. </p> <p>Shields adds: \"We found the second stage brought in a lot more adults, because we knew how to tackle the communities better. We try to cater to their needs, rather than offer them particular job skills or qualifications - we say, 'Right, you want to do this, let's do it.' One lady was physically shaking at the thought of touching a computer on her first day. Six months later, she'd got a qualification through us, was about to finish a college course and was applying for jobs for the first time in years.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, Paul Bagnell is now looking either at a college-based course or at getting work using his new skills. \"From being very wary, pretty scared of making a fool of myself, I reckon I could take someone through the basic course now. And my kids think it's excellent. They come home, go through their homework and can talk to me about it. I can sit down and teach them how to do it.\" </p> <p>A van may seem like an unlikely place to start \"bridging the digital divide\", but it's getting a significant number of people on the first step of the bridge.</p>",

For the decision has been taken not just to demolish half the centre and build a 16-screen cinema plus health club, but - more significantly - to give the place a new name: the Wandsworth Shopping Centre. </p> <p>\"We feel the word Arndale has a few too many connotations,\" says the centre's marketing manager, Yuri Illukumbre. \"Even the name Wandsworth is only an interim solution.

The Arndale at Poole in Dorset, for example, is now called the Dolphin Centre; the Leeds Arndale has become the Crossgates Centre, and the main shopping precinct in the Lancashire town of Nelson has been relaunched as the Admiral. </p> <p>Most Wandsworth residents agree than the upgrade has not come before time. As far back as 1985, the local newspapers were talking wishfully about \"Facelift for the Arndale\" and, over the past decade, the grubbiness of its car parks and the sheer unloveliness of its exterior has led to a decline in what its marketing team call the \"retail offer\". </p> <p>First, Sainsbury's moved out, then Tesco, then the fruit and veg market, and recent years have seen the influx of so many downmarket shops that it's become hard to buy anything at the centre for over \u00a31. </p> <p>Now, though, some \u00a350m is to be spent on improving not just the shopping centre but the blocks of high-rises which were built on top of it - and which helped the development qualify for the description \"one of London's great architectural disasters\" in the local history society's guidebook. </p> <p>That, maintains the centre's marketing team, is all in the past, and architects Leslie Jones have come up with a scheme that will sweep away the centre's anonymous, grey-clad frontage and replace it with a dramatic blue entrance portal. Meanwhile, talk is of \"shopper high-dwell\" parts of the centre - as opposed to places where people just sit and have a fag. </p> <p>No question, then, that in this and other parts of the country the Arndale name is considered well past its sell-by date. However, it wasn't always so. Back in the early 1960s, the arrival of an Arndale was seen as the resurrection of many a moribund town centre. </p> <p>But who on earth was Arndale? Was he a lord? A construction method? It is a fact known only by property professionals and players of Trivial Pursuit (it's actually one of the questions) that there was not one creator of these centres, but two. </p> <p>Enter, carrying rolled-up plans, Arnold Hagenbach, a third generation Wakefield bakery magnate, whose parents originally came from Switzerland. </p> <p>Alongside him is fellow Yorkshireman, Otley-born Sam Chippindale, who started out as a small-time estate agent above a Bradford barber's shop. </p> <p>Put the \"Arn\" of Arnold with the \"Dale\" of Chippindale, and you've got a twin-headed beast that has had more buildings named after it than the Queen Mother. There's even a sundial memorial to Chippindale in the middle of his home-town square. </p> <p>Of the two partners, Chippindale had the higher profile by far. According to author Oliver Marriott, who wrote a 1968 book called The Property Boom, Chippindale's biggest assets in the eyes of those northern councillors who approved his projects were that he was a straight talker and didn't come from London. </p> <p>The borough treasurer of Jarrow, on Tyneside, is quoted as saying: \"He was a bit blunt and outspoken, and he impressed some of my councillors who were more than a little difficult to impress.

The pie shop at the Jarrow Arndale, for example, was reported to be the busiest in the entire north-east. And this was in a town which had famously been in serious decline. </p> <p>\"Both Hagenbach and Chippindale had been to the US and seen the growth of shopping malls,\" says Peter Edwards, of Oxford Brookes University's school of planning. \"It was really they who introduced to this country the idea of a shopping centre as somewhere you might go for a day out. </p> <p>\"There's no doubt, too, that Chippindale had a nose for property, for sniffing out undervalued and underused land. Just before the M62 was built, he spotted a large amount of land in Batley that he realised would become accessible from all five Yorkshire cities. At the time, he never got the scheme through, but what's standing there today? An enormous Ikea store. He knew a good opportunity when he saw one.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, while 1960s shopkeepers and developers were rubbing their hands, and shoppers were enjoying being able to get out of the rain, the more aesthetically motivated members of the public were altogether more anti-Arndale. </p> <p>\"There are people today amassing stupendous fortunes by systematically destroying our historic centres,\" raged architectural writer James Lees-Milne, in 1964. \"Eventually, all the buildings of the area - good, bad and indifferent - are replaced with chain stores, supermarkets and blocks of flats devoid of all distinction, and all looking alike.\" </p> <p>Back in those days, such criticisms could be dismissed as fuddy-duddy polemic. Now, though, having had 40 years to get used to the idea of shopping centres, the British public wants more from its malls than concrete walls and a water feature. And for those occasions when pulling the whole place down and starting again just isn't an option, a change of name can be a start. </p> <p>Hence the Bolton Arndale is now Crompton Place, and the Bradford Arndale is now the Kirkgate. Note here the feelgood history factor that is built into these new names: Crompton, the 18th-century industrial giant and inventor of the spin ning mule; Kirkgate, ancient point of access for cross-Pennine travellers. </p> <p>Mind you, there are some Arndales which are happy with their name, and sticking to it.

Tom Kirkwood is as sober-suited as an undertaker, yet he's as optimistic about the elderly as Larkin was glum. He's not a poet; he's a gerontologist, and he is delivering this year's BBC Reith lectures - on ageing. </p> <p>Larkin's phrase, slightly adapted, has been chosen as the title for the series - The End of Age. But don't rush to turn off Radio 4 tonight when the first lecture is broadcast, because Kirkwood has a thoughtful take on how society regards - and should treat - older people. </p> <p>There have been astounding increases in life expectancy over the past 150 years, he says; and his thesis is that we still haven't adjusted, as a society, to take account of the potential offered by this longevity. </p> <p>It might seem that disaffection of the young is the only item of social concern popularly discussed, but elderly people gradually have been getting themselves back on the national agenda. Last year, there was Age Concern's grand, policy-forming forum, Debate of the Age, and the conclusion of the \"better government for older people\" exercise. Last week, ministers decreed that the NHS must give the elderly the same priority as other age groups. </p> <p>Now the BBC is giving the Reith platform over to the subject of old age and, in Kirkwood, has selected an academic who has combined several disciplines in a way which makes him unusually well placed to pontificate (though gently is his way) on ageing and the aged. </p> <p>For the past 18 months, Kirkwood has been head of the gerontology department, and professor of medicine, at Newcastle University - a rare achievement for someone who never trained as a medic. At Cambridge, he studied maths, followed by a PhD in biology in 1983. Just 10 years later, at Manchester, he became Britain's first professor of biological gerontology. </p> <p>Although he has played a leading role in research into ageing - at 26, he put forward the widely accepted \"disposable soma\" theory, to explain the how and why of humans growing old - he has a passion for bridging gaps between disciplines, where researchers ought to be cooperating. </p> <p>\"It's crucial that we look at the challenge of ageing in a joined up way,\" he says. \"We've got to consider both scientific and societal changes, because they interact in a huge way.\" </p> <p>The good news is that science is telling us we are not programmed to die at any given time. \"Once we realise we're not programmed with a specific date of death in our genomes, we see what determines how long we live is the gradual build up of faults in the cells and tissues. If we can find ways of reducing exposure to damage, boosting the natural repair and maintenance systems, there's no reason why we shouldn't extend our health span, and add a significant degree of well-being to the extra years.\" </p> <p>So the science is bright, but our social attitudes are dismal. For while more and more of us are surviving longer and longer, \"we are, if anything, more negative about old age, because it's lost its status and because we see that there are organisational challenges ahead\". </p> <p>Kirkwood is not one of those academics who refuses to think about the social consequences of his research. Over the years, he has grown increasingly concerned to bridge the policy/practice divide. He has been an adviser on ageing to a string of international organisations. Currently, he is chairing a government \"foresight taskforce\", identifying the healthcare needs of future retirees. </p> <p>So where do we start to get rid of ideas about the elderly that are, as he puts it, \"outmoded and fatalistic\"? Almost anywhere, he says, for so much needs to be done. \"We need to recognise that when we think of old people as a burden, by seeing it in this negative way, we make it worse for ourselves. If we under-invest in opportunities for old people to maintain their independence and well-being, we will end up having to foot a heavier bill for social and medical dependency. If we help by restructuring housing, transport and shopping, and focus on education and leisure, we'll see a greater economic participation by the elderly in coming decades.\" </p> <p>Several of his thoughts on changes in social and economic policy are familiar, such as the desirability of a flexible retirement. But his dislike of our present \"archaic, 19th-century idea\" of a fixed retirement age may seem unusual, coming from a scientist. </p> <p>Then again, Kirkwood has a social conscience and a sociologist's powers of observation. That sheltered housing in the Lancashire village where he once lived: rebuilt, with the best of intentions, half a mile from the centre - isolating its residents. Bad planning. The struggle he had to find an uncomplicated mobile phone for his mother. Bad design. </p> <p>As well as the high-level international interchanges with experts, the everyday feeds into his thinking. Take our obsession with youth and beauty. How strange, he says, that the old who go to lengths to maintain a youthful appearance are held up as icons. And he adds: \"I personally find that an older face, with its lines and wrinkles, is extremely beautiful and interesting.\" </p> <p>Kirkwood, 50 this year, is fascinated to observe the ageing of his own mind and body. He hopes to be productive long into old age, but - a question everyone asks a gerontologist - he does not expect to live unusually long. However, he knows how to enjoy his span. He recently started piano lessons, which he says he is enjoying greatly.

It's the local primary school, not a church. </p> <p>It was a wonderful place for its pupils, of whom I was one in the 1950s and early 60s, and it had very strong associations with the chocolate factory. We had Christmas entertainment in the factory theatre, learned to swim in the \"Girls'\" (ie women's) baths, and had our sports day on the factory sports ground. </p> <p>In our final term before we left the school, we were escorted up the carillon tower to hear and see it in action, and then taken on a tour of the chocolate factory. The smell of chocolate is enough to bring all the memories flooding back. </p> <p><strong>Judith Eversley</strong><br> Bath <br></p> <p>\u0095 It is interesting to reflect on the position of the \"poor\" who are still being housed by the Bournville Village Trust. </p> <p>Alan Shrimpton, the trust's estates director, states that the vast majority of incoming tenants are on housing benefit, but omits to mention that social housing tenants provide the greater sum of money needed to maintain the \"green and pleasant land\". </p> <p>Figures for the year ending December 1999 reveal that the trust's costs for estate maintenance and management were \u00a31.4m. Income from sources other than housing amounted to just \u00a3864,838. The balance is funded from the rent paid by social housing tenants. </p> <p>The tenants have argued, without success, for clear separation to be established between social housing finance and the other business activities of the trust, including the management of the estate. </p> <p>The developing situation is that an increasing proportion of the rent surplus is being derived from housing benefit, so that the state - and tenants on modest incomes, often pensioners, who do not qualify for benefit - are subsidising the estate. </p> <p>The final twist in the tale is that the maintenance charge to freeholders, based upon a formula determined by the high court, is in the order of \u00a360 a year. This is close to one week's rent for many of the trust's tenants. </p> <p>I wonder what George Cadbury and Dylan Thomas would make of this situation?</p> <p><strong>Cyril Bezant</strong><br> Birmingham <br></p> <p><strong>Release muddle </strong><br></p> <p> Amid all the concern about the regime at Feltham and other young offenders' institutions, I have come across a worrying matter concerning a 12-year-old in custody. </p> <p>This boy is serving an 18-month detention and training order, the first half of which is spent in custody and the other half under supervision in the community. The boy has been serving the custodial sentence in local authority secure accommodation. </p> <p>He and his social worker were told from the start that his release date was March 1 and all his preparations were based on that date. However, come March 1, with his social worker at the gate to collect him, he was told that a mistake had been made and he had a further month to serve. Apparently there had been confusion as to whether a month on remand should be included in calculating his nine months in custody. It had been included, mistakenly it seems. </p> <p>It is known that prisoners often go through a variety of acute emotions prior to release. The psychological damage to a 12-year-old boy - in care, with both parents missing - could be considerable. </p> <p>My role was to organise a family group conference.

It's the local primary school, not a church. It was a wonderful place for its pupils, of whom I was one in the 1950s and early 60s, and it had very strong associations with the chocolate factory. We had Christmas entertainment in the factory theatre, learned to swim in the \"Girls'\" (ie women's) baths, and had our sports day on the factory sports ground. In our final term before we left the school, we were escorted up the carillon tower to hear and see it in action, and then taken on a tour of the chocolate factory. The smell of chocolate is enough to bring all the memories flooding back. Judith Eversley Bath \u0095 It is interesting to reflect on the position of the \"poor\" who are still being housed by the Bournville Village Trust. Alan Shrimpton, the trust's estates director, states that the vast majority of incoming tenants are on housing benefit, but omits to mention that social housing tenants provide the greater sum of money needed to maintain the \"green and pleasant land\". Figures for the year ending December 1999 reveal that the trust's costs for estate maintenance and management were \u00a31.4m. Income from sources other than housing amounted to just \u00a3864,838. The balance is funded from the rent paid by social housing tenants. The tenants have argued, without success, for clear separation to be established between social housing finance and the other business activities of the trust, including the management of the estate. The developing situation is that an increasing proportion of the rent surplus is being derived from housing benefit, so that the state - and tenants on modest incomes, often pensioners, who do not qualify for benefit - are subsidising the estate. The final twist in the tale is that the maintenance charge to freeholders, based upon a formula determined by the high court, is in the order of \u00a360 a year. This is close to one week's rent for many of the trust's tenants. I wonder what George Cadbury and Dylan Thomas would make of this situation? Cyril Bezant Birmingham Release muddle Amid all the concern about the regime at Feltham and other young offenders' institutions, I have come across a worrying matter concerning a 12-year-old in custody. This boy is serving an 18-month detention and training order, the first half of which is spent in custody and the other half under supervision in the community. The boy has been serving the custodial sentence in local authority secure accommodation. He and his social worker were told from the start that his release date was March 1 and all his preparations were based on that date. However, come March 1, with his social worker at the gate to collect him, he was told that a mistake had been made and he had a further month to serve. Apparently there had been confusion as to whether a month on remand should be included in calculating his nine months in custody. It had been included, mistakenly it seems. It is known that prisoners often go through a variety of acute emotions prior to release. The psychological damage to a 12-year-old boy - in care, with both parents missing - could be considerable. My role was to organise a family group conference. I expected to see the wrong corrected, but my faith in the system was misplaced.

The \"UK online\" campaign launched last September was intended to coordinate these, and introduced a new \"on-line network of e-learning services\", to get people with no knowledge of computers over the first hurdle. The problem is that however much they want to get over that hurdle, any association with educational institutions is going to put some people off. </p> <p>Rob Cawthron, community development officer for the Newcastle-based Home Housing Association, explains: \"On some of the estates where we work, three or four generations have been unemployed. People have been marginalised. There are all sorts of issues about exclusion, underachievement, and learning. Using the standard approach of institutions seemed a bit of a non-starter - if people felt school wasn't for them, what was the point of getting an educational institution to supply training?\" In other words, as more people overall become e-familiar, these groups will be excluded further. </p> <p>Housing associations and others are tackling this in different ways. Home Housing audited the training provision available and found that tenants wanted local, estate-based training, which wasn't necessarily directed towards a qualification. \"Lots of people just won't travel very far.

Home Housing opted for training based in a \"mobile learning centre\" - a specially converted van with eight workstations and two trainers on board. The centre started on five estates where, Cawthron says, \"if it could work, and be seen to work, it could work anywhere\". A year into a three-year access and training programme, the vehicle is now working throughout the north-east, including special sessions for groups such as Asian women, excluded teenagers, and refugees and asylum seekers. It has also worked with homeless young people and with women's refuges. </p> <p>Alan Shields works for Computer Gym, a separate company which provides the training and the vehicle. Like Cawthron, he treats the project as much more than just a training exercise. In fact \"sometimes the computer side takes a bit of a back seat. People come in and have a chat for about five minutes before they actually touch a computer\". By far the most important element, he says, is building up trust and fitting into the local community. \"At the beginning, it's important to get right down to ground level, pushing leaflets through doors so that people come out and ask what you're doing. You have to make yourself known to people who wouldn't otherwise come - we often attract people by standing outside and having a chat.\" </p> <p>However, Shields is just as keen on getting local people across the digital divide. \"There's a real shortage of computer skills, especially in the north-east, so it's important that we're giving them not just a community centre, but skills they need. You've got to start showing people what to do and overcoming their lack of confidence.

They are also pleased both with \"hard\" results - a good number of trainees have gained formal qualifications, moved on to other courses or found work - and the \"softer\" one of overall confidence around computers. </p> <p>Shields adds: \"We found the second stage brought in a lot more adults, because we knew how to tackle the communities better.

It does not harm humans, and it only rarely kills animals. The virus takes a toll on productivity, but not generally of life. The disease lowers milk production and reduces the working ability of animals. In a month they recover. Animals can, however, die of other diseases like haemorrhagic septicaemia when their immunity has been lowered by FMD. In India, 400 animals have died in the past couple of months not of FMD but haemorrhagic septicaemia, which infects the throat and blocks the respiratory tract. </p> <p>FMD is endemic to India, and used to be in Europe.

They are the primeval agents who enrich the soil -nature's great land transformers - who supply organic matter which, after treatment, becomes nutrient matter of the greatest importance.

But the service, billed as the muscle behind Labour's rhetorical assault on the drop-out generation, is already raising serious doubts that it will deliver. </p> <p>Elements of Connexions have been tested since last April in 13 pilot areas and the plan is to introduce it throughout the country in coming years. There are concerns, though, that the scheme is being launched before it has proved itself. </p> <p>Personal advisers are at the heart of the service. Deployed in schools, further education colleges and the community, their task will be to steer young people towards goals and guide them to relevant services. The personal adviser will become a new profession, but the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) has yet to establish a standardised qualification for the role. </p> <p>This is leaving youth workers fearing that Connexions will undermine their profession, diluting a service already overstretched, and that it will focus on career development at the expense of personal development. In most of the pilot areas, the privatised careers service led the partnerships - prompting concern that profit will rule. </p> <p>\"No one can deny the principles behind Connexions are right, but the fact that it's evolutionary is a bit of a worry,\" says Richard Parson, head of development at the National Youth Agency. \"Partnerships are starting before the specifications of Connexions seem to be tied down.\" </p> <p>Another worry, according to Jennifer Izekor, deputy chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services, is that many groups working with disaffected young people have not felt involved in planning the new service. \"A Connexions partnership has the task of trying to build relationships with a plethora of organisations,\" she says. \"That is our fear: until local networks exist, it's going to be hard to be involved.\" </p> <p>Meeting targets set by the government is also a concern. At a training session for advisers in the south Yorkshire pilot - covering Sheffield, Doncaster, Barnsley and Rotherham - one trainee remarks: \"The DfEE are telling us that Ben Nevis has to be reached. But these young people don't even know it exists - forget wanting to go there.\" </p> <p>Another of the trainees, who are drawn from backgrounds as diverse as the careers service, youth offending teams and women's refuges, observes that social services and education are still not up to speed about what Connexions is, or how it works, and do not yet recognise the legitimacy of personal advisers in the referral process. \"It should not be up to us to fight this battle,\" the trainee says. \"It's not up to us to go and ask these authorities to work with us.\" </p> <p>But cooperation among services in the region is well established, insists David Gault, head of Sheffield's youth service. Indeed, there is even a sense of reinventing the wheel. \"There was a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\" he says. \"But the basis for working together is right. It's about improving things for young people.\" </p> <p>Research by the Local Government Association (LGA) does suggest that, in planning Connexions, the DfEE has not fully involved schools and colleges - where much of the service will be delivered. Martin Liddle, a member of the national executive of the National Association of Head Teachers, says that the number of personal advisers available to work in schools is \"nothing like the resource originally planned\". He thinks schools will end up sharing advisers. </p> <p>\"Personal advisers have to be credible to pupils and parents,\" says Liddle. \"They've got to understand the workings of the school. I'm not sure too many of those people exist.\" </p> <p>The presence of personal advisers within schools also raises questions about confidentiality. A young person may not want information shared with one individual to be passed on to another. Ruth Vincent, the Association of Director of Social Services' representative on education, says a protocol on confidentiality is just beginning to be worked on. But it will be decided at local, rather than national level. </p> <p>Vincent believes the universality of Connexions will act as a \"leveller\". \"The personal adviser is a very different role to a social worker,\" she says. \"It carries no stigma and will make children with social workers more like other children.\" </p> <p>The launch of this new, coherent strategy aimed at all young people - but giving priority to those most at risk of underachievement or disaffection - is a response to some bleak trends among modern youth. Bridging the Gap, the 1999 social exclusion unit report, seen as the genesis of Connexions, said that 9% of 16 to 18-year-olds were not in education, training or work - a figure that had not changed in six years. </p> <p>That report identified 16 as a critical age: at the end of compulsory education, clear paths and goals often fall away and the teenager may descend into relationship, family and health problems, including homelessness, persistent offending or problem drug use. The government hopes that under-16s will be kept on course by Connexions, reducing exclusions and truancy. </p> <p>Young people dropping out, or failing to achieve in full-time education, cost an estimated \u00a3350m a year, according to the DfEE. Funding for Connexions, which amounts to \u00a3420m in the first instance, is by comparison only \u00a3177m more than the careers service already receives. So the Treasury is not looking at a big net outlay - if the idea works. </p> <p>Ultimately, Connexions is about meeting targets. It aims to reduce time lost though truancy and cut the number of permanent exclusions by 33% by 2002. Targets also include increasing GCSE achievement by 16-year-olds by the same year; increasing the number of care leavers in employment, training or education; and reducing the number of young people offending, using illegal drugs or becoming pregnant. </p> <p>Much of the pilot's work has focused on setting up the bureaucratic framework to deliver the service, as well as appointing managers and training personal advisers. </p> <p>Malcolm Wicks, DfEE minister for life-long learning with responsibility for Connexions, acknowledges that the service is \"still at a relatively early stage\". He says: \"This is a very complicated piece of social policy. It's bound to vary from area to area. In some areas some agencies are more involved and committed than others. I understand that it's difficult to translate our vision into local practice.\" </p> <p>Wicks insists, however, that Connexions will not be just a rebadged careers service. \"I want some people to work in the adviser role who are not conventional people in the welfare state, but [who] within their own community have shown a real talent with working with young people.\" </p> <p>The LGA says its research into the embryonic Connexions scheme did show its potential benefits. However, the research also found that genuine partnerships could not be created overnight. Although some areas had forged relationships relatively quickly, the LGA says, many were struggling to meet \"unreasonable\" timescales imposed upon them. </p> <p>The anxiety among the Connexions pioneers is that expectations will be unreasonable too. </p> <p><strong>Growing concern</strong></p> <p> Connexions will be a universal youth support service for 13 to 19-year-olds in England, aiming to provide an improved universal careers service as well as additional help and support to prepare for the transition to work and adult life. </p> <p>Statutory agencies, the voluntary sector and the careers service will work together to provide every young person with a personal adviser. This may include advice on education and employment options, helping with family or peer group difficulties, or working with specialist services to overcome serious problems such as drug abuse or homelessness. </p> <p>A Connexions national unit, based at the DfEE, will oversee the service. Regionally, Connexions partnerships based on learning skills councils areas will be responsible for planning and funding. The daily delivery of the service will be run by committees, most of which will be based on local authority boundaries. </p> <p>In Wales, the national assembly has rejected a Connexions approach in favour of boosting the youth service.</p> <p>Teenage advice schemes earn praise for partnership: full story at <a href=\"http://www.societytheguardian.com/socialcare/\">www.societytheguardian.com/socialcare/</a></p>",

Bridging the Gap, the 1999 social exclusion unit report, seen as the genesis of Connexions, said that 9% of 16 to 18-year-olds were not in education, training or work - a figure that had not changed in six years. That report identified 16 as a critical age: at the end of compulsory education, clear paths and goals often fall away and the teenager may descend into relationship, family and health problems, including homelessness, persistent offending or problem drug use. The government hopes that under-16s will be kept on course by Connexions, reducing exclusions and truancy. Young people dropping out, or failing to achieve in full-time education, cost an estimated \u00a3350m a year, according to the DfEE. Funding for Connexions, which amounts to \u00a3420m in the first instance, is by comparison only \u00a3177m more than the careers service already receives. So the Treasury is not looking at a big net outlay - if the idea works. Ultimately, Connexions is about meeting targets. It aims to reduce time lost though truancy and cut the number of permanent exclusions by 33% by 2002. Targets also include increasing GCSE achievement by 16-year-olds by the same year; increasing the number of care leavers in employment, training or education; and reducing the number of young people offending, using illegal drugs or becoming pregnant. Much of the pilot's work has focused on setting up the bureaucratic framework to deliver the service, as well as appointing managers and training personal advisers. Malcolm Wicks, DfEE minister for life-long learning with responsibility for Connexions, acknowledges that the service is \"still at a relatively early stage\". He says: \"This is a very complicated piece of social policy. It's bound to vary from area to area. In some areas some agencies are more involved and committed than others. I understand that it's difficult to translate our vision into local practice.\" Wicks insists, however, that Connexions will not be just a rebadged careers service. \"I want some people to work in the adviser role who are not conventional people in the welfare state, but [who] within their own community have shown a real talent with working with young people.\" The LGA says its research into the embryonic Connexions scheme did show its potential benefits. However, the research also found that genuine partnerships could not be created overnight. Although some areas had forged relationships relatively quickly, the LGA says, many were struggling to meet \"unreasonable\" timescales imposed upon them. The anxiety among the Connexions pioneers is that expectations will be unreasonable too. Growing concern Connexions will be a universal youth support service for 13 to 19-year-olds in England, aiming to provide an improved universal careers service as well as additional help and support to prepare for the transition to work and adult life. Statutory agencies, the voluntary sector and the careers service will work together to provide every young person with a personal adviser. This may include advice on education and employment options, helping with family or peer group difficulties, or working with specialist services to overcome serious problems such as drug abuse or homelessness. A Connexions national unit, based at the DfEE, will oversee the service. Regionally, Connexions partnerships based on learning skills councils areas will be responsible for planning and funding. The daily delivery of the service will be run by committees, most of which will be based on local authority boundaries. In Wales, the national assembly has rejected a Connexions approach in favour of boosting the youth service.

      "bodyText": "The people of Castleton, a honeypot village in the Peak District's limestone country, are desperate to tell anyone who will listen that their village is wide open. There have been no outbreaks of foot and mouth in the Peak national park. But at every entrance, big red signs warn of the disease and explain that paths and bridleways are closed. Tourists have been frightened off, say those who run businesses in the village. The tea lounge The Creme de la Creme, run by Tony and Barbara Singleton \"Visitors imagine that we will be antagonistic if they come. They seem to think we are going to stone them. \"Yesterday we took \u00a32.75 in the cafe and didn't sell anything in the shop. \"Last week we took \u00a319.75 between Wednesday and Friday. Our rent is \u00a3175 a week. \"It's an idyllic situation. I think I'm on holiday every day and unfortunately I am at the moment. This is the time for the oldies to be out here before the hordes arrive. \"But they are the very people who are responsible and feel they must do nothing to cause further problems. So they stay away. Yet they would have a far better experience if they came now because there are no crowds about.\" The hotel The Cheshire Cheese, run by Ken Slack \"We have just over 300 rooms available in the village and on the first weekend after the outbreak almost all were booked. But visitors turned up to occupy only 17 of those rooms. \"Those big red warning signs might just as well say 'Keep out'. We've been told of drivers telling people getting on buses at Sheffield, 'Don't go to Castleton - it's closed.' A couple of overzealous national park wardens were flagging down cars and advising drivers to turn round. \"Three-quarters of the people who come here never step off tarmac to walk in the fields. But even they are not coming. I'm certain some businesses will fail. \"If they are working on a \u00a320,000 overdraft and cash flow stops, they will go under.\" The shop The Old Barn (gifts, ice cream and walking gear), run by Brian Johnson \"It's now 11.5am and I haven't had a customer yet. Yesterday we had only 16 transactions adding up to less than \u00a3100. We are just tootling along. We are talking about tightening belts and switching off lights. I haven't booked a family holiday this year.\" The visitor attraction Peak Cavern, run by John Harrison \"In the past four years, the number of visitors to the cave has gone up by about 40% to 35,000 a year. In the past few weeks, it's gone down by 65%. I've got a new car park, website and leaflets. You feel powerless. It's so disappointing. The village store and cafe Run by Sheila and Morris Burkinshaw and son Guy \"There has been a 25% drop in trade. If this goes on, we are going to be hit very hard. \"But there's not a lot we can do. We worry an awful lot because we feel so helpless. We would hate to be feel responsible for bringing foot and mouth into the valley so we are wary of pushing too much to bring people in.\" The book shop Hawkridge, run by Irene Tierney \"I think they are beginning to come back to the village now. We have done quite well because we sell a lot of books through the internet. I have had six customers in this morning.\" Interviews by David Ward Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up More on the election and foot and mouth Politics: foot and mouth What's going on?

But the service, billed as the muscle behind Labour's rhetorical assault on the drop-out generation, is already raising serious doubts that it will deliver. </p> <p>Elements of Connexions have been tested since last April in 13 pilot areas and the plan is to introduce it throughout the country in coming years. There are concerns, though, that the scheme is being launched before it has proved itself. </p> <p>Personal advisers are at the heart of the service. Deployed in schools, further education colleges and the community, their task will be to steer young people towards goals and guide them to relevant services. The personal adviser will become a new profession, but the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) has yet to establish a standardised qualification for the role. </p> <p>This is leaving youth workers fearing that Connexions will undermine their profession, diluting a service already overstretched, and that it will focus on career development at the expense of personal development. In most of the pilot areas, the privatised careers service led the partnerships - prompting concern that profit will rule. </p> <p>\"No one can deny the principles behind Connexions are right, but the fact that it's evolutionary is a bit of a worry,\" says Richard Parson, head of development at the National Youth Agency. \"Partnerships are starting before the specifications of Connexions seem to be tied down.\" </p> <p>Another worry, according to Jennifer Izekor, deputy chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Youth Services, is that many groups working with disaffected young people have not felt involved in planning the new service. \"A Connexions partnership has the task of trying to build relationships with a plethora of organisations,\" she says. \"That is our fear: until local networks exist, it's going to be hard to be involved.\" </p> <p>Meeting targets set by the government is also a concern. At a training session for advisers in the south Yorkshire pilot - covering Sheffield, Doncaster, Barnsley and Rotherham - one trainee remarks: \"The DfEE are telling us that Ben Nevis has to be reached. But these young people don't even know it exists - forget wanting to go there.\" </p> <p>Another of the trainees, who are drawn from backgrounds as diverse as the careers service, youth offending teams and women's refuges, observes that social services and education are still not up to speed about what Connexions is, or how it works, and do not yet recognise the legitimacy of personal advisers in the referral process. \"It should not be up to us to fight this battle,\" the trainee says. \"It's not up to us to go and ask these authorities to work with us.\" </p> <p>But cooperation among services in the region is well established, insists David Gault, head of Sheffield's youth service. Indeed, there is even a sense of reinventing the wheel. \"There was a feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\" he says. \"But the basis for working together is right. It's about improving things for young people.\" </p> <p>Research by the Local Government Association (LGA) does suggest that, in planning Connexions, the DfEE has not fully involved schools and colleges - where much of the service will be delivered. Martin Liddle, a member of the national executive of the National Association of Head Teachers, says that the number of personal advisers available to work in schools is \"nothing like the resource originally planned\". He thinks schools will end up sharing advisers. </p> <p>\"Personal advisers have to be credible to pupils and parents,\" says Liddle. \"They've got to understand the workings of the school. I'm not sure too many of those people exist.\" </p> <p>The presence of personal advisers within schools also raises questions about confidentiality. A young person may not want information shared with one individual to be passed on to another. Ruth Vincent, the Association of Directors of Social Services' representative on education, says a protocol on confidentiality is just beginning to be worked on. But it will be decided at local, rather than national level. </p> <p>Vincent believes the universality of Connexions will act as a \"leveller\". \"The personal adviser is a very different role to a social worker,\" she says. \"It carries no stigma and will make children with social workers more like other children.\" </p> <p>The launch of this new, coherent strategy aimed at all young people - but giving priority to those most at risk of underachievement or disaffection - is a response to some bleak trends among modern youth. Bridging the Gap, the 1999 social exclusion unit report, seen as the genesis of Connexions, said that 9% of 16 to 18-year-olds were not in education, training or work - a figure that had not changed in six years. </p> <p>That report identified 16 as a critical age: at the end of compulsory education, clear paths and goals often fall away and the teenager may descend into relationship, family and health problems, including homelessness, persistent offending or problem drug use. The government hopes that under-16s will be kept on course by Connexions, reducing exclusions and truancy. </p> <p>Young people dropping out, or failing to achieve in full-time education, cost an estimated \u00a3350m a year, according to the DfEE. Funding for Connexions, which amounts to \u00a3420m in the first instance, is by comparison only \u00a3177m more than the careers service already receives. So the Treasury is not looking at a big net outlay - if the idea works. </p> <p>Ultimately, Connexions is about meeting targets. It aims to reduce time lost though truancy and cut the number of permanent exclusions by 33% by 2002. Targets also include increasing GCSE achievement by 16-year-olds by the same year; increasing the number of care leavers in employment, training or education; and reducing the number of young people offending, using illegal drugs or becoming pregnant. </p> <p>Much of the pilot's work has focused on setting up the bureaucratic framework to deliver the service, as well as appointing managers and training personal advisers. </p> <p>Malcolm Wicks, DfEE minister for life-long learning with responsibility for Connexions, acknowledges that the service is \"still at a relatively early stage\". He says: \"This is a very complicated piece of social policy. It's bound to vary from area to area. In some areas some agencies are more involved and committed than others. I understand that it's difficult to translate our vision into local practice.\" </p> <p>Wicks insists, however, that Connexions will not be just a rebadged careers service. \"I want some people to work in the adviser role who are not conventional people in the welfare state, but [who] within their own community have shown a real talent with working with young people.\" </p> <p>The LGA says its research into the embryonic Connexions scheme did show its potential benefits. However, the research also found that genuine partnerships could not be created overnight. Although some areas had forged relationships relatively quickly, the LGA says, many were struggling to meet \"unreasonable\" timescales imposed upon them. </p> <p>The anxiety among the Connexions pioneers is that expectations will be unreasonable too.</p>",
