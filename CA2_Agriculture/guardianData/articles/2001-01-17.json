He meant nine inches. \"I think the defence is playing too deep,\" quipped Marsh. </p> <p>The guests arrive at about 11 and some 45 minutes later the panellists get their voices in gear by commenting on a spoof story, with Stelling leading the way.

      "body": "<p>They are six months old, have been sold twice, shared by three sets of parents and driven for 2,000 miles across the United States as their latest mother and father fled their previous family. Even their names are in question. Belinda and Kimberley are the calm, unknowing centre of an international row which began with one couple's desperation for another child. </p> <p>Alan and Judith Kilshaw flew to San Diego, California, on December 1, elated that their quest was finally over. They were yearning to meet their new children, twin sisters they had found via an adoption website run by Tina Johnson of the Caring Hearts Agency. </p> <p>Ms Johnson said the birth mother, Tranda Wecker, believed the couple would be ideal parents for her young daughters, and promised to arrange the whole affair - for \u00a38,200. </p> <p>The Kilshaws agreed to meet the girls right away, at Ms Johnson's insistence. If she felt the sight of the twins would clinch the deal, she was right; the couple were soon cooing happily over their new children in the hotel lobby. </p> <p>\"As soon as I saw the girls, they felt like ours,\" Mrs Kilshaw, aged 47, said later. But they were not. And as the Kilshaws prepared to leave with the children the next day they were confronted by an angry man who insisted that the sisters were part of his family. </p> <p>Unknown to the British couple, the babies, known initially as Kiara and Keyara, had been placed with another family two months before. Richard and Vickie Allen - a plumber and medical assistant - were completing adoption proceedings for the twins, who seemed to be settling happily into their new home in San Bernadino and bonding well with their brother Andrew, who was also adopted. </p> <p>Like the Kilshaws, the Allens had contacted Ms Wecker through Ms Johnson; unlike the Kilshaws, they had only paid her \u00a34,000. </p> <p>Their relationship with Ms Wecker, 28, a twice-divorced hotel receptionist, had also become strained after she hinted that she wanted financial help with divorce proceedings against the babies' father. </p> <p>Ms Wecker had been determined to have the children adopted, contacting adoption agencies even before their premature birth in St Louis, Missouri. But when she called the Allens asking to see the babies one last time for \"closure\", they felt they could not refuse. In fact, Ms Wecker and Ms Johnson drove the sisters straight to the Kilshaws' hotel in San Diego, following up with a phone call to say that the children would not be returning. Ms Johnson said Ms Wecker had changed her mind and wanted to place them with someone else, refusing to say why and ignoring the Allens' calls. </p> <p>In desperation, the Allens reported to police that the children had been kidnapped and sent Mrs Allen's brother Richard Churchill - who lived near the motel - to intercede. He told the Kilshaws that the babies already had a home and begged them to return them, eventually persuading Mr Kilshaw to speak to Mr Allen. </p> <p>Mr Kilshaw, aged 45, was adamant that they would not return the girls, claiming the Allens had no legal rights because they had not completed adoption proceedings and the birth mother had changed her mind. Ms Wecker claimed that Mrs Allen was an unfit mother because she had an old conviction for embezzlement. </p> <p>The British couple were unwilling to take any chances with the Californian authorities. Faced with the prospect of a lengthy legal wrangle which could lead to the loss of the twins, they fled the state with the girls and Ms Wecker. </p> <p>They covered thousands of miles in a hired car as they headed first for Missouri, to pick up the birth certificates, then to Little Rock, Arkansas, which allows fast-track adoptions. </p> <p>Pursued by the Allens and anxious that the FBI could be on their trail as well, they sped across the States, through deserts and ice storms, sleeping in the car when they could not find motel space. </p> <p><strong> Tensions</strong><br> </p> <p>The babies developed worrying coughs; one was taken to hospital, where doctors found she was dehydrated because she was spending so long in the car. It also brought out tensions between the Kilshaws and Ms Wecker, who wanted money for clothes, food and accommodation. They spent thousands of dollars on her before paying for her flight back to Missouri; hundreds more on her estranged husband, who refused to sign the adoption agreement unless he received more cash. </p> <p>Holed up in Little Rock for the 10 day cooling-off period required by Arkansas, they stayed one step ahead of the Allens, finalising the adoption with a five-minute court hearing on December 22. Satisfied that the twins were truly theirs, they changed the girls' names to Belinda and Kimberley and flew them to Britain on their American passports, as temporary visitors. </p> <p>As the new arrivals settle in at the family's seven-bedroom farm on the outskirts of Buckley, north Wales, the Kilshaws seem sanguine about the whole affair. </p> <p>They say they have had plenty of support from friends and family, including their sons James, seven, and Rupert, four, and Cayley, Mrs Kilshaw's 18-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. \"Our other children say they are beautiful and there have been no pangs of jealousy or resentment,\" Mrs Kilshaw said. </p> <p>The real question is how happy the twins will be. Sold twice to the highest bidder, chased across the United States and flown thousands of miles from their first home; their story sounds as if it comes off the Jerry Springer show, rather than from a book of fairy tales. The Kilshaws say the babies are adapting well and will learn the truth about their background when they are old enough. </p> <p>\"We are going to tell them the truth,\" Mr Kilshaw insisted. \"We are going to compile a story book of photos of their mother and sister in America. They will be told as they ask and they will be shown the story book and told the why and the how.\" </p> <p>However defiantly the Kilshaws show off the new additions to their family, the trouble is not going to go away. Their promises of cooperation may not be enough to satisfy the authorities. </p> <p>The Allens are asking the FBI to intervene and arrange the babies' return. Flintshire social services are investigating the case in detail. The Home Office must decide whether to grant the twins residency rights. </p> <p>But the Kilshaws are unrepentant. \"If anyone is thinking of adopting a child abroad, then they should contact us and we can point them in the right direction in America,\" Mr Kilshaw said yesterday.</p>",

They were yearning to meet their new children, twin sisters they had found via an adoption website run by Tina Johnson of the Caring Hearts Agency. Ms Johnson said the birth mother, Tranda Wecker, believed the couple would be ideal parents for her young daughters, and promised to arrange the whole affair - for \u00a38,200. The Kilshaws agreed to meet the girls right away, at Ms Johnson's insistence. If she felt the sight of the twins would clinch the deal, she was right; the couple were soon cooing happily over their new children in the hotel lobby. \"As soon as I saw the girls, they felt like ours,\" Mrs Kilshaw, aged 47, said later. But they were not. And as the Kilshaws prepared to leave with the children the next day they were confronted by an angry man who insisted that the sisters were part of his family. Unknown to the British couple, the babies, known initially as Kiara and Keyara, had been placed with another family two months before. Richard and Vickie Allen - a plumber and medical assistant - were completing adoption proceedings for the twins, who seemed to be settling happily into their new home in San Bernadino and bonding well with their brother Andrew, who was also adopted. Like the Kilshaws, the Allens had contacted Ms Wecker through Ms Johnson; unlike the Kilshaws, they had only paid her \u00a34,000. Their relationship with Ms Wecker, 28, a twice-divorced hotel receptionist, had also become strained after she hinted that she wanted financial help with divorce proceedings against the babies' father. Ms Wecker had been determined to have the children adopted, contacting adoption agencies even before their premature birth in St Louis, Missouri. But when she called the Allens asking to see the babies one last time for \"closure\", they felt they could not refuse. In fact, Ms Wecker and Ms Johnson drove the sisters straight to the Kilshaws' hotel in San Diego, following up with a phone call to say that the children would not be returning. Ms Johnson said Ms Wecker had changed her mind and wanted to place them with someone else, refusing to say why and ignoring the Allens' calls. In desperation, the Allens reported to police that the children had been kidnapped and sent Mrs Allen's brother Richard Churchill - who lived near the motel - to intercede. He told the Kilshaws that the babies already had a home and begged them to return them, eventually persuading Mr Kilshaw to speak to Mr Allen. Mr Kilshaw, aged 45, was adamant that they would not return the girls, claiming the Allens had no legal rights because they had not completed adoption proceedings and the birth mother had changed her mind. Ms Wecker claimed that Mrs Allen was an unfit mother because she had an old conviction for embezzlement. The British couple were unwilling to take any chances with the Californian authorities. Faced with the prospect of a lengthy legal wrangle which could lead to the loss of the twins, they fled the state with the girls and Ms Wecker. They covered thousands of miles in a hired car as they headed first for Missouri, to pick up the birth certificates, then to Little Rock, Arkansas, which allows fast-track adoptions. Pursued by the Allens and anxious that the FBI could be on their trail as well, they sped across the States, through deserts and ice storms, sleeping in the car when they could not find motel space. Tensions The babies developed worrying coughs; one was taken to hospital, where doctors found she was dehydrated because she was spending so long in the car. It also brought out tensions between the Kilshaws and Ms Wecker, who wanted money for clothes, food and accommodation. They spent thousands of dollars on her before paying for her flight back to Missouri; hundreds more on her estranged husband, who refused to sign the adoption agreement unless he received more cash. Holed up in Little Rock for the 10 day cooling-off period required by Arkansas, they stayed one step ahead of the Allens, finalising the adoption with a five-minute court hearing on December 22. Satisfied that the twins were truly theirs, they changed the girls' names to Belinda and Kimberley and flew them to Britain on their American passports, as temporary visitors. As the new arrivals settle in at the family's seven-bedroom farm on the outskirts of Buckley, north Wales, the Kilshaws seem sanguine about the whole affair. They say they have had plenty of support from friends and family, including their sons James, seven, and Rupert, four, and Cayley, Mrs Kilshaw's 18-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. \"Our other children say they are beautiful and there have been no pangs of jealousy or resentment,\" Mrs Kilshaw said. The real question is how happy the twins will be. Sold twice to the highest bidder, chased across the United States and flown thousands of miles from their first home; their story sounds as if it comes off the Jerry Springer show, rather than from a book of fairy tales. The Kilshaws say the babies are adapting well and will learn the truth about their background when they are old enough. \"We are going to tell them the truth,\" Mr Kilshaw insisted. \"We are going to compile a story book of photos of their mother and sister in America. They will be told as they ask and they will be shown the story book and told the why and the how.\" However defiantly the Kilshaws show off the new additions to their family, the trouble is not going to go away. Their promises of cooperation may not be enough to satisfy the authorities. The Allens are asking the FBI to intervene and arrange the babies' return. Flintshire social services are investigating the case in detail. The Home Office must decide whether to grant the twins residency rights. But the Kilshaws are unrepentant. \"If anyone is thinking of adopting a child abroad, then they should contact us and we can point them in the right direction in America,\" Mr Kilshaw said yesterday.",

      "bodyText": "An MP who successfully piloted a bill through parliament to regulate overseas adoptions has called on the government to rush forward its introduction to prevent a repeat of the \"twins for sale\" case. Liberal Democrat MP Mark Oaten said his Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act makes it a criminal offence to bring children into the UK without obtaining social services approval through a home visit. But although the bill was passed in 1999, it is not due to become law until 2002, because regulations - which formalise the adoption of bills into law - have yet to be introduced by the government. The Winchester MP said: \"There must be no repeat of this appalling case. Bringing children into the country without obtaining social services approval must be made a criminal offence. The government has already promised to investigate the case, in which a British couple, Alan and Judy Kilshaw, of Buckley, north Wales, paid a \u00a38,200 fee to adopt six-month-old twins in the US before bringing them into the UK on a six-month tourist visa. Home secretary Jack Straw has called the transaction, which was arranged over the internet, a \"matter of huge concern\" and \"a revolting idea\". While the twins for sale adoption appears to be legal, an admission by the twins's mother, Tranda Wecker, of St Louis, Missouri, that she lied about her address on the adoption papers, may yet invalidate it in both Britain and the US. Ms Wecker admitted that she falsely used her aunt's address in Little Rock, Arkansas, in order to exploit that state's more liberal laws. The Kilshaws circumvented British law - which requires a pre-adoption home visit from local authority social services - by arranging a private home visit, which is legal under Arkansas law. But Mr Oaten said: \"A home visit (form local authority social services) should be the precondition to any adoption. \"Couples thinking of adopting are far better advised to go through local social services and official agencies, not cruise the internet as if they were buying a second-hand car. Mr Oaten also voiced concerns about adopting from America, claiming variable state laws were \"open to potential abuse\". The Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999 makes provision for giving effect to the Convention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of Intercountry Adoption, concluded at the Hague on May 29 1993. \"Grave doubts surround adoptions from America in particular,\" Mr Oaten added. \"The USA has not signed up to the Hague Convention and variable state laws are open to potential abuse.\"",

      "bodyText": "Legislation to prevent a repeat of the \"twins for sale\" affair will not come into force for several months, even though a bill regulating overseas adoptions received royal assent more than a year ago. Prime minister Tony Blair admitted to MPs today that the Adoption (Intercountry Aspects) Act 1999, which would enforce \"proper rules and standards\" on overseas adoption, would not be ready until \"later this year\". Liberal Democrat MP Mark Oaten, who introduced the bill, said the delay in fully enforcing it had effectively created a loophole which allowed the \"buying\" of children for adoption from the US over the internet. Mr Blair's admission came as MPs discussed the case of six-month-old US twins Kimberley and Belinda, who were \"adopted\" by north Wales couple Alan and Judith Kilshaw, who brought them to Britain after paying an agency \u00a38,200. Mr Blair, who called the affair \"absolutely deplorable\", was joined by opposition leader William Hague in condemning the \"trade\" in adopted children. But Mr Oaten criticised the government for not acting quickly enough to fully enforce the bill. He told SocietyGuardian.co.uk: \"I am pretty confident that if the bill had been fully implemented then this couple (the Kilshaws) could have been facing criminal action.\" According to Mr Oaten, the bill has been \"80%\" implemented but because some of its provisions could result in people being sent to prison, aspects of it relating to overseas adoption had been passed to the Home Office for further legal work. Mr Oaten said he had been surprised at the length of time it had taken the Home Office to process the legal aspects of the act. Referrring to Mr Oaten's bill, Mr Blair said: \"This is a piece of legislation that was passed by this House some time ago and it will set in place proper rules and standards to be applied in any case where there is intercountry adoption. \"This is obviously a very serious and difficult situation, but I think it is right that we legislate on adoption in this country as soon as possible, and then bring into effect the regulations that are there on the statute book in respect of intercountry adoption.\" Mr Blair said the government planned to press ahead with new adoption laws in the current parliamentary session to clear away some of the \"bureaucratic obstacles\" to adoption. Mr Blair was responding to Tory leader William Hague, who pledged Opposition support for reform of adoption law. Mr Hague said: \"It cannot be right for children simply to be sold to the highest bidder and you will want to cooperate as closely as possible with other countries to prevent any more cases like this and ensure that laws against baby trading are as tight as possible. \"One of the ways of reducing the chances of this happening in other cases would be to press ahead with much-needed reform of adoption law in this country.\" Mr Blair said: \"I think everyone feels it is absolutely deplorable that children are traded in this way. Adoption should always be about the interests of the child first.\" Referring to the adoption bill, which was announced before Christmas, and which aims to make adoption in the UK easier, Mr Blair said he was determined to introduce legislation in the next few months. \"There is a general acceptance now that we have to clear away some of the bureaucratic obstacles,\" he said.",

But, even if tonight sees the Daggers miss out on a win bonus and a fourth-round home tie to Tottenham, they can still claim a lose bonus. </p> <p>As well as capturing the football public's imagination in the best tradition of the FA Cup, they will pocket a \"nice little earner\". </p> <p>To put that into perspective, this scrimp-and-save outfit's annual net gate receipts come to around \u00a3100,000. Their cup run, including both Charlton games (with tonight's live on Sky), will bring in, after expenses, as much as \u00a3275,000. </p> <p>Their financial secretary Steve Thompson explains: \"We're not a limited company with a wealthy owner. We're a members' club who always have to break even, which is a struggle. Anything spent on the playing side, we have to raise ourselves.\" </p> <p>The club has already earmarked some of this unexpected windfall. Some will go towards a new stand at their tiny Victoria Road ground (average crowd 1,300; current capacity 5,406), some will go on outstanding loans, some will go towards laying two all-weather pitches behind the stadium. </p> <p>These will benefit not only the first team, the club's under-18 and youth sides plus their two women's teams but, just as importantly, the community. </p> <p>So can Charlton's \u00a315,000-a-week superstars avoid the humiliation of defeat by a team of meat porters, landscape gardeners and trainee cabbies who play football part-time for about \u00a3150 a week? </p> <p>All the Daggers' manager Garry Hill - a lifelong Spurs supporter - will promise is \"we will run and work and fight until we drop\". </p> <p>\u0095 The third-round replay between Notts County and Wimbledon was abandoned at 1-1 after 50 minutes last night when fog closed in on Meadow Lane. County led via Richard Liburd on 20 minutes but, despite the introduction of an orange ball at half-time, Dean Blackwell's 49th-minute equaliser was all but lost in the mist.

The quality of the Conference side's football, their commitment and organisation, though, suggests otherwise. But, even if tonight sees the Daggers miss out on a win bonus and a fourth-round home tie to Tottenham, they can still claim a lose bonus. As well as capturing the football public's imagination in the best tradition of the FA Cup, they will pocket a \"nice little earner\". To put that into perspective, this scrimp-and-save outfit's annual net gate receipts come to around \u00a3100,000. Their cup run, including both Charlton games (with tonight's live on Sky), will bring in, after expenses, as much as \u00a3275,000. Their financial secretary Steve Thompson explains: \"We're not a limited company with a wealthy owner. We're a members' club who always have to break even, which is a struggle. Anything spent on the playing side, we have to raise ourselves.\" The club has already earmarked some of this unexpected windfall. Some will go towards a new stand at their tiny Victoria Road ground (average crowd 1,300; current capacity 5,406), some will go on outstanding loans, some will go towards laying two all-weather pitches behind the stadium. These will benefit not only the first team, the club's under-18 and youth sides plus their two women's teams but, just as importantly, the community. So can Charlton's \u00a315,000-a-week superstars avoid the humiliation of defeat by a team of meat porters, landscape gardeners and trainee cabbies who play football part-time for about \u00a3150 a week? All the Daggers' manager Garry Hill - a lifelong Spurs supporter - will promise is \"we will run and work and fight until we drop\". \u0095 The third-round replay between Notts County and Wimbledon was abandoned at 1-1 after 50 minutes last night when fog closed in on Meadow Lane. County led via Richard Liburd on 20 minutes but, despite the introduction of an orange ball at half-time, Dean Blackwell's 49th-minute equaliser was all but lost in the mist. The teams will try again next Tuesday. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say. Send your comments, as sharp or as stupid as you like, to editor@footballunlimited.co.uk",

Jon Scourse, finance director of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, says: \"Transparency is critical, but one of the key problems is that the public has been led to believe that there is no cost in fundraising. All organisations have overheads.\" </p> <p>Andrew Watt, ICFM spokesperson adds: \"One of the principal problems facing the voluntary sector is how to move public perception on to a different level.

By contrast, legacy fundraising can be portrayed in accounts as extremely efficient. \"However,\" Ventham says, \"legacies don't come in without years of relationship building at a local level.\" </p> <p>Maple adds: \"The conference is part of the whole debate about how to show return on investment and find comparable measures between charities. We also need to move the debate on from how much is spent on administration and fundraising and tell people very openly that we are spending the whole pound on the causes we feel passionately about.\" </p> <p>To further this, he thinks charities should promote good news stories. He uses the example of the RNLI, which has been criticised in the past for its cash reserves. \"We shouldn't be concentrating on reserves, but the people saved by lifeboats,\" says Maple. \"How many millions is that worth?\" </p> <p>Shirley Scott, CFDG director, believes donors and funders are much more understanding about reserves than they were three years ago. \"Our members are now working with their fundraising colleagues to ensure that the system of accounting is simple and accurate,\" she says. \"We believe fuller explanation in annual reports will promote better understanding of fundraising as well.\" </p> <p>Research by the NCVO has sug gested that the public would like more information from charities to enable them to make more informed choices about their giving. However, charities believe they already produce a large amount of information. Helen Bush, NCVO policy officer, says: \"There is scope for better matching of the two, with charities perhaps reconsidering what are the most appropriate and meaningful ways of providing information for the public.\" </p> <p>The conference tomorrow has been preceded by two workshops that brought fundraisers and finance directors together. One of the people who orchestrated this move is Alan Sharpe, finance director at the RSPB. The backdrop is the new charity accounting guidelines, known as Sorp, which are intended to give accounts more transparency and consistency. \"We are trying to encourage finance staff to see accounts as more than just a technical compliance job and more as part of the overall communications mix,\" says Sharpe. </p> <p>He is pleased that Graham is attending the workshop he is running. \"With hindsight, the NSPCC now feels it should have been more proactive in putting its message across that campaigning is a very important part of its job,\" says Sharpe. </p> <p>\"If charities can't spend money trying to win hearts and minds, then we are taking away a vital tool of the sector. But we do need to make sure people understand what we are doing so we are less open to criticism.\" </p> <p>The closing address at the conference will be given by Sir Nicholas Young, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Relief. He believes that, historically, charities have done themselves a disservice by not being open and confident about what they need to spend. While he is sympathetic to public pressure to keep overheads down, he insists that to run a charity wisely you need to invest in areas such as accounting systems, IT, quality staff and decent publicity materials. </p> <p>\"I hope all charities will take the opportunity offered by the new accounting system to stand up straight and explain why and how they spend money,\" says Young. \"The NSPCC experience has been painful for everyone in the voluntary sector.

I seem to have spent the whole time travelling from one place to another without really seeing or doing anything.</p> <p>Auckland was ok but it rained every day I was there so I just caught up on washing clothes, writing emails and other boring tasks. It was also a bit of a shock to be back in a bustling city after quiet, laid-back Fiji. Almost straight away, I felt myself slipping into urban mode, walking faster and getting annoyed if people got in my way - I might as well have been back in London.</p> <p>The cave tubing I mentioned at the end of my last report was a big disappointment. The brochure promised a high adrenalin rush with pictures of happy customers screaming with excitement as they happily drowned themselves in a deep cave. It actually turned out to be gently floating along in the dark looking up at some glowing worms hanging from the ceiling. Nice, but not really worth the NZ$50 it cost me.</p> <p>I was the only one on the tour (this should have told me something I guess) so I had the undivided attention of the two guides and all their little practical jokes, such as switching off the torches and disappearing down another cave leaving me to bump into a dead-end. Hilarious. However, I did get an <a href=\"http://travel.guardianunlimited.co.uk/gallery/0,8563,399239,00.html\">attractive photo</a> of me in figure-hugging caving outfit.</p> <p>On Tuesday I had planned to walk the Tongariro Crossing. This is supposed to be the best one-day tramp in New Zealand, passing through some spectacular volcanic terrain.

      "bodyText": "This has been a frustrating week. I seem to have spent the whole time travelling from one place to another without really seeing or doing anything. Auckland was ok but it rained every day I was there so I just caught up on washing clothes, writing emails and other boring tasks. It was also a bit of a shock to be back in a bustling city after quiet, laid-back Fiji. Almost straight away, I felt myself slipping into urban mode, walking faster and getting annoyed if people got in my way - I might as well have been back in London. The cave tubing I mentioned at the end of my last report was a big disappointment. The brochure promised a high adrenalin rush with pictures of happy customers screaming with excitement as they happily drowned themselves in a deep cave. It actually turned out to be gently floating along in the dark looking up at some glowing worms hanging from the ceiling. Nice, but not really worth the NZ$50 it cost me. I was the only one on the tour (this should have told me something I guess) so I had the undivided attention of the two guides and all their little practical jokes, such as switching off the torches and disappearing down another cave leaving me to bump into a dead-end. Hilarious. However, I did get an attractive photo of me in figure-hugging caving outfit. On Tuesday I had planned to walk the Tongariro Crossing. This is supposed to be the best one-day tramp in New Zealand, passing through some spectacular volcanic terrain. However, I woke up to find 90 knot winds, rain and low cloud - the shuttle buses to the trailhead weren't even running. So I pressed on to Wellington instead and did a quick walk round the city. I liked what I saw. It's right next to the sea with lovely wooden houses running up the green hills of the suburbs. I took a stroll though the botanical gardens which were beautiful and full of scent. And I went down to the wharf where the first yachts in the BT Global Challenge were arriving to a big welcome from crowds of supporters.

Doh! Thanks for the offer Charlotte - sorry, I left it too late to take it up but glad you made it back from the US okay.

When we eventually abandoned those discussions, we pointed out that in our view the Conservatives did not want the debate, they wanted the story of the debate, as a diversion from real discussion of real issues of concern to people. Mr Hague's recent interview with David Frost, and the broadcast and print media's coverage of it, focussing as it did almost exclusively on this issue, suggested little has changed in this regard.

The Prime Minister and other senior Labour figures will engage in large numbers of media and public appearances before and during a campaign so that all the issues relevant to a campaign can be thoroughly aired. As you know, the Prime Minister sees particular value in meetings and broadcast debates involving members of the public, whose agenda is often different to that of the media and the Westminster village. In 1997 we sought to ensure audience, and not just media, participation in any agreed proposal and note that your proposal makes not provision for audience participation.

      "body": "<p>Just as turkeys do not vote for Christmas, so prime ministers do not agree to appear in TV debates. Though there have been positive noises coming out of Downing Street over the past six months on this subject it is no surprise that Tony Blair has decided not to face William Hague and Charles Kennedy during the election campaign.</p> <p>Today's decision, like so many tales of Labour spin, starts with Peter Mandelson. Back in the autumn of 1996 he paid a trip to San Diego where he saw Bill Clinton take on Bob Dole. He returned to Britain and challenged John Major to cross swords on TV with Blair during the forthcoming election campaign. Having made the running, Mandelson and co then got cold feet as the election got closer and Labour's lead in the polls widened.</p> <p>By the time the campaign got under way, Blair had made it clear he had no intention of taking on Major. He got his old mentor and now Lord Chancellor, Derry Irvine, to find him a sneaky way out, which he successfully did - much to Major's private relief. Irvine accused the Tories, the Lib Dems and broadcasters of all moving the goalposts. By the time everyone had worked out what was going on there was not enough time to organise anything. </p> <p>The 1997 rows have left a deep scar with Downing Street staffers. They do not want the humiliation of pulling Blair out of a televised debate any closer to polling day. To rule it out so early in the campaign may bring about accusations that he is running scared, but Blair will concede some bad headlines tomorrow in return for avoiding a star turn by Hague during a TV debate and the big lift in the polls.</p> <p>No one will be more disappointed than the Tories' leader by this latest announcement.

      "bodyText": "Just as turkeys do not vote for Christmas, so prime ministers do not agree to appear in TV debates. Though there have been positive noises coming out of Downing Street over the past six months on this subject it is no surprise that Tony Blair has decided not to face William Hague and Charles Kennedy during the election campaign. Today's decision, like so many tales of Labour spin, starts with Peter Mandelson. Back in the autumn of 1996 he paid a trip to San Diego where he saw Bill Clinton take on Bob Dole. He returned to Britain and challenged John Major to cross swords on TV with Blair during the forthcoming election campaign. Having made the running, Mandelson and co then got cold feet as the election got closer and Labour's lead in the polls widened. By the time the campaign got under way, Blair had made it clear he had no intention of taking on Major. He got his old mentor and now Lord Chancellor, Derry Irvine, to find him a sneaky way out, which he successfully did - much to Major's private relief. Irvine accused the Tories, the Lib Dems and broadcasters of all moving the goalposts. By the time everyone had worked out what was going on there was not enough time to organise anything. The 1997 rows have left a deep scar with Downing Street staffers. They do not want the humiliation of pulling Blair out of a televised debate any closer to polling day. To rule it out so early in the campaign may bring about accusations that he is running scared, but Blair will concede some bad headlines tomorrow in return for avoiding a star turn by Hague during a TV debate and the big lift in the polls. No one will be more disappointed than the Tories' leader by this latest announcement. He made clear to David Frost last Sunday on BBC1 that he was desperate for a TV debate. His strong performances in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's Questions have given him and his team rare victories during the dark days the opposition. The electorate will of course also be disappointed: a TV debate would have offered a rare opportunity to give some life to an election campaign when apathy is at an all time high amongst voters. With this lack of interest being most prevalent amongst Labour's supporters a TV debate may have encouraged them to get to the polls. If a low turnout in Labour heartlands gives the Tories a few unlikely wins then Blair may look back at the day that he ruled out a TV debate and wish he had been a little braver.",

      "body": "<p>The appalling case of the murder of Anna Climbie has inevitably put child protection work under fresh scrutiny. But there is renewed controversy over the number of child killings in Britain and its record compared to other countries. </p> <p>Much of the media reaction to the case, which ended last Friday in the conviction of Anna's carers and the ordering of a statutory inquiry into the actions of Haringey council, north London, and other agencies involved, has assumed that Britain has a poor record that is, at best, not improving. </p> <p>This belief appears to have stemmed largely from the NSPCC, which said in its official statement on the case that \"we have failed to cut the overall number of children who die from abuse or neglect\". </p> <p>The statement went on: \"Home Office figures show that the rate of child homicide in England and Wales has not dropped over the last 25 years. In each generation of children, more than 1,000 will be killed before reaching adulthood. Most will die at the hands of violent or neglectful parents and carers. The lives of another one or two children continue to be taken every week.\" </p> <p>This has jarred with research by Colin Pritchard, professor of psychiatric social work at Southampton University, who has asserted that Britain's record on child killings has improved strikingly in recent years. Whereas it was the third worst in the western world in 1974, at the time of the watershed inquiry into the death of Maria Colwell, it has since become the fifth best. </p> <p>Pritchard's findings have been welcome sustenance for social services leaders, anxious to prove the worth of their departments that were set up in the mid-70s. Should his interpretation be overturned, particularly at a time when social services is bearing the brunt of criticism over the Climbie case, the consequences could be profound. </p> <p>So who is right? The Home Office statistics relied upon by the NSPCC show that the rate of homicide of children under one year old in England and Wales is indeed higher than in 1975, when it was 50 per million population. In 1999-2000, it was 59. However, the rate for the one to four age group is lower (six per million, compared to 10) and that for the five to 15 group is only marginally higher (three per million, as against 2.5). </p> <p>In numbers of children killed, a similar pattern emerges: 37 under age one in 1999-2000, compared to 31 in 1975; 15 in the one to four age group, in contrast to 27; and 25 in the five to 15 group, compared to 22. </p> <p>Overall, though, this represents 80 deaths in 1975 and only 77 last year. Moreover, the number exceeded 100 in 1985 and homicide rates generally were higher in the mid-80s than in 1974.

      "bodyText": "The appalling case of the murder of Anna Climbie has inevitably put child protection work under fresh scrutiny. But there is renewed controversy over the number of child killings in Britain and its record compared to other countries. Much of the media reaction to the case, which ended last Friday in the conviction of Anna's carers and the ordering of a statutory inquiry into the actions of Haringey council, north London, and other agencies involved, has assumed that Britain has a poor record that is, at best, not improving. This belief appears to have stemmed largely from the NSPCC, which said in its official statement on the case that \"we have failed to cut the overall number of children who die from abuse or neglect\". The statement went on: \"Home Office figures show that the rate of child homicide in England and Wales has not dropped over the last 25 years. In each generation of children, more than 1,000 will be killed before reaching adulthood. Most will die at the hands of violent or neglectful parents and carers. The lives of another one or two children continue to be taken every week.\" This has jarred with research by Colin Pritchard, professor of psychiatric social work at Southampton University, who has asserted that Britain's record on child killings has improved strikingly in recent years. Whereas it was the third worst in the western world in 1974, at the time of the watershed inquiry into the death of Maria Colwell, it has since become the fifth best. Pritchard's findings have been welcome sustenance for social services leaders, anxious to prove the worth of their departments that were set up in the mid-70s. Should his interpretation be overturned, particularly at a time when social services is bearing the brunt of criticism over the Climbie case, the consequences could be profound. So who is right? The Home Office statistics relied upon by the NSPCC show that the rate of homicide of children under one year old in England and Wales is indeed higher than in 1975, when it was 50 per million population. In 1999-2000, it was 59. However, the rate for the one to four age group is lower (six per million, compared to 10) and that for the five to 15 group is only marginally higher (three per million, as against 2.5). In numbers of children killed, a similar pattern emerges: 37 under age one in 1999-2000, compared to 31 in 1975; 15 in the one to four age group, in contrast to 27; and 25 in the five to 15 group, compared to 22. Overall, though, this represents 80 deaths in 1975 and only 77 last year. Moreover, the number exceeded 100 in 1985 and homicide rates generally were higher in the mid-80s than in 1974. Meanwhile, the rate among the population as a whole has risen sharply from nine per million in 1975 to 14 in 1999-2000. Pritchard's data are based on standardised World Health Organisation figures, comparing the average for 1974-78 to that for 1993-97. For all children aged 0-14 in England and Wales, he shows the homicide rate to have fallen from 22 per million to eight. Over the same period, the US average soared from 29 to 41. Pritchard is coming out fighting, accusing the NSPCC of \"joining the witch-hunt against social services\". He says: \"Based on the only international comparative figures we have, our child protection services, which include police, social services and health, have never been more effective in saving the lives of children.\"",

Well, there's Jeff Powell for a start, Ray the Unionist in his John Bull outfit, League Managers' chief John Barnwell, Mrs J Bogle of Bradford the list, we suspect, goes on. But Peter Taylor won't be subscribing to that theory, oh no. Because not only did the head Fox get a free go as national boss thanks to Svennis's Lazio commitments, he might also get himself a new striker too!</p> <p>And not any old striker (although he is old). Taylor is today in talks with Roberto Mancini - former Sampdoria legend and one-time number two to Svennis at Lazio - over a potential short-term move to Filbert Street. Taylor hopes to sign Mancini for a month, then maybe till the end of the season (and if he just wants to hang around till the weekend that would be nice too). \"Sven told me that Mancini is a fantastic professional and that he would be ideal to come here and add experience to our attack,\" Taylor said today as Ade Akinbiyi slipped over in the background. \"It will depend on how our talks go but if everything seems all right we will start with a month's loan so we can take a look at him.\"</p> <p>As chance might have it, Mr Mancini is also interested in a spell at Filbert Street. Not necessarily for the best of reasons, mind, but interested all the same. \"It is not easy for me, after 24 years of playing, to have nothing,\" said Mancini, who is currently out of work, and won't be getting any Job Seeker's Allowance with that sort of attitude. \"I will listen to what Leicester offer me,\" he desponded. At the last, however, things took a turn for the cheerier. \"This experience could profit my career. It appeals to me to learn the language and take in another culture.\" Culture Leicester what has Svennis been saying?</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>TRANSFER SYSTEM GOING TO POT?

      "bodyText": "WAITING FOR THE MANCINI Now, who said there were no positive advantages to having a Svennis as England coach? Well, there's Jeff Powell for a start, Ray the Unionist in his John Bull outfit, League Managers' chief John Barnwell, Mrs J Bogle of Bradford the list, we suspect, goes on. But Peter Taylor won't be subscribing to that theory, oh no. Because not only did the head Fox get a free go as national boss thanks to Svennis's Lazio commitments, he might also get himself a new striker too! And not any old striker (although he is old). Taylor is today in talks with Roberto Mancini - former Sampdoria legend and one-time number two to Svennis at Lazio - over a potential short-term move to Filbert Street. Taylor hopes to sign Mancini for a month, then maybe till the end of the season (and if he just wants to hang around till the weekend that would be nice too). \"Sven told me that Mancini is a fantastic professional and that he would be ideal to come here and add experience to our attack,\" Taylor said today as Ade Akinbiyi slipped over in the background. \"It will depend on how our talks go but if everything seems all right we will start with a month's loan so we can take a look at him.\" As chance might have it, Mr Mancini is also interested in a spell at Filbert Street. Not necessarily for the best of reasons, mind, but interested all the same. \"It is not easy for me, after 24 years of playing, to have nothing,\" said Mancini, who is currently out of work, and won't be getting any Job Seeker's Allowance with that sort of attitude. \"I will listen to what Leicester offer me,\" he desponded. At the last, however, things took a turn for the cheerier. \"This experience could profit my career. It appeals to me to learn the language and take in another culture.\" Culture Leicester what has Svennis been saying? * * * * * * * * * * * * * TRANSFER SYSTEM GOING TO POT? WHO YOU GONNA CALL Pay attention at the back! It's Squadron Leader Fiver here, and I've been drafted in to give a little backbone to this here transfer system meltdown crisis. A lot of panic, dithering and general wimpery can set in in situations like this, and I'm here to make sure none of you get the wrong bally idea! You there, Aigner! Yes. you with your face hidden behind your big Uefa Chief Executive badge! I hear you're spitting your dummy because Fifa submitted a document to the European Commission without consulting you. A document that would give players the chance to terminate contracts at three months notice without the club getting any compensation. And what are you going to do about this document, Aigner? Are you going to cry? No, you're going to arrange a last-ditch meeting with Fifa on Friday. What are you going to do? \"Ask for a meeting with the Fifa president making our point that the so called non-paper submitted by Fifa cannot be considered as a basis for negotiation for European football.\" Dashed right you are. And you, Johansson! Yes, you with the upturned bowl of yoghurt, ready to fill your gullet until your very intestines explode! What are you going to do about this bally crisis that threatens to tear the world of football apart? Are you going to poo your pants? No, you're not, you're going to insist that any negotiations continue according to the platform established by the Fifa/Uefa/FifPro Football Taskforce. What are you going to do? \"We will not negotiate that paper, whatever Fifa decides. We have a request from the leagues that we negotiate on the basis of documents deliberated by the Task Force. Our participation will be based on these papers.\" You most certainly will. Now, get back to work, and stop that bally whinging! * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Frankly speaking, as long as we don't buy Edwin van der Sar or Peter Schmeichel I won't be worried because I don't mind who sits on the bench!\" - Sander Westerveld cheers everyone up with the kind of self-confidence that serves him so well.

My son is 11: now and again, he has a couple of teaspoons of wine in water. But getting drunk is the culture in some families, and it licenses all sorts of uncontrolled behaviour. Alcohol is not supposed to change your behaviour; it is to make more civilised the normal intercourses of life. But even in families as civilised and European as Tony Blair's, there is a strong pull on children to conform to this culture. Getting drunk should not be viewed as something manly. <br><strong>Verdict: No </strong></p> <p><strong> Kirsteen Sheppard</strong> <br><strong>Spokesperson, Hit (drug and alcohol harm reduction) </strong><br> </p> <p>While the role of parents and socialisation in the family is important, there are many pressures on young people. We have to look at society and the way products are marketed to a young audience. In the absence of a national strategy on alcohol, it is difficult to know which way to turn. I am concerned about the links between alcohol and aggression: alcohol contributes to 78% of assaults.

      "bodyText": "Malcolm Gluck Wine correspondent, the Guardian Parents cannot divorce themelves from culpability when their children get drunk. My son is 11: now and again, he has a couple of teaspoons of wine in water. But getting drunk is the culture in some families, and it licenses all sorts of uncontrolled behaviour. Alcohol is not supposed to change your behaviour; it is to make more civilised the normal intercourses of life. But even in families as civilised and European as Tony Blair's, there is a strong pull on children to conform to this culture. Getting drunk should not be viewed as something manly. Verdict: No Kirsteen Sheppard Spokesperson, Hit (drug and alcohol harm reduction) While the role of parents and socialisation in the family is important, there are many pressures on young people. We have to look at society and the way products are marketed to a young audience. In the absence of a national strategy on alcohol, it is difficult to know which way to turn. I am concerned about the links between alcohol and aggression: alcohol contributes to 78% of assaults. We are bringing out information about alcohol, using the same techniques as the companies marketing it, so that young people can make choices about it.

She's a Hollywood actress: rich, beautiful, scorchingly successful and incapable of looking after herself. </p> <p>But it turns out that she's lonely, stressed out, unhappy, unloved.

No lost PE kits, leaking radiators or bouncing cheques to bring you back down to earth. </p> <p>Anyway, released from hospital, she sets about cheering herself up. Does she: a) find a boyfriend, b) eat chocolate, or c) get a puppy? No, she adopts a baby. Yes, the person who can't even keep her own constitution going without medical intervention gets a whole new someone to look after. A dependent who, over the next 20, 30, 40 years, will emotionally bruise, physically exhaust and financially drain her. </p> <p>To be fair on the new adoptive mum, Calista Flockhart, there is nothing wrong with giving a child a home. Every child adopted is one less in an institution. And before I criticise this impulse buy too hard, it should also be admitted that this actress is 10 years older and a whole lot richer than I was when - in love, impulsive in a different way - I decided to make my own firstborn. </p> <p>I know too that, possibly unlike Ally McFlockhart, I was crucially blessed. I fell for a man who suggested babies before I'd had a chance to get broody. I never heard my biological clock murmur, let alone tick.

I do hope with all my heart that this woman is now sufficiently revived (and rehydrated) to have grasped what the deal is. Let's just hope her agent has been through the small print. </p> <p>First, having kids is no guarantee of getting yourself loved. It's a nice idea, but it simply isn't how it works. Having children, adopting babies, is about giving, giving, giving again and then - when you're down, bleeding from that right hook they've just administered - having the strength and imagination to get up and give again. </p> <p>Oh, newborns - they're famously easy to want, easy to love. Squeakily new, honey-smelling, gorgeously unsullied by life's queasy compromises. But that heart-melting gaze they fix upon you - as if you were their best, sweetest and only angel - lasts about two years. If you're lucky. </p> <p>After that, you continue to love them - God, how you continue to love them! - but they struggle, they complain, they cry, they vomit, they leave their packed lunches at home, refuse to wear a scarf in deepest winter, tell you they hate you, expect money, get nits, worms, detention, spots. And sulky. </p> <p>They love you, of course they do. But don't imagine they are put on earth to express it. Anything but. You are ill, running a fever, can barely crawl to bed; they want to know whether you can record Rugrats so they can watch Robot Wars on the other side. Your first novel is published - 20 copies delivered to your door- and they want to know how soon they can cut up the box. You feed, clothe, house and support them, try to tolerate their friends, smelly rooms, unnerving habits; they run off to India and (so I'm told) never even bother to phone. </p> <p>So think about it, Calista. You're not a teenager growing up on a wind-ravaged estate in Nottingham. You don't need a baby because life's crap and you're terminally lonely. Think hard. What's your reasoning? </p> <p>When my first baby fixed his navy-blue eyes on mine and blew his first bubble, his father squeezed my hand and said, \"And one day he'll tell you to piss off.\" That day is almost here. Being a parent is all about loving with no immediate or tangible hope of return. If you kid yourself into thinking otherwise, your life will be a catalogue of disappointments.

      "body": "<p>It isn't everyone's idea of a day out, hanging at a skateboard park. It's not mine - I don't skate, for a start. But set against alternatives - a trip to Disneyland Paris, for example - it's a sharp enough idea, not least because, to coin a phrase, I don't do theme parks. </p> <p>Although it could be argued that a skate park is a theme park, it isn't. Governed by a single principle, spiritually, it's an art gallery. Thought of like that, it sounds fine. And unlike theme parks, there is no possibility that you'll be greeted at the entrance, or inside, or nearby, or anywhere in the vicinity at all, by a person in a furry animal costume trying to engage you in a \"fun\" conversation. Skateboarders are single-issue characters who wouldn't even notice. My son Jack became one of these about a year ago. He turned up with secondhand equipment that he got from this boy down the road which would only cost this bloke called his dad 20 quid. A bargain. </p> <p>The inevitable was about a week in coming. \"I need to upgrade. This deck doesn't ollie properly, dude.\" </p> <p>(Dude?) \"Okay,\" I said, wondering who or what an ollie might be. </p> <p>\"Now. I need it now. Can we go now?\" </p> <p>\"Er, all right.\" </p> <p>At the aptly named retail outlet, Hoax, I was introduced to the idea that, at full retail prices, the bearings alone for the wheels to a skateboard deck cost \u00a320. Still, that's cheap compared to the deck itself, which cost \u00a340 or \u00a350 (\u00a350 for a what - a plank ?), the wheels a further \u00a340, and the trucks (the things the wheels are attached to), another \u00a330. I've been here before: yo-yos, '98. </p> <p>\"How can a yo-yo cost \u00a345, Jack?\" </p> <p>(With a sigh, like, how could I not know?) \" Dad , it's got gears.\" </p> <p>We emerged from our first visit to Hoax, avec plank and plank accessories. \"Do you know you could buy a whole bike for less than that when I was your age?\" </p> <p>\"Yeah, Dad. Right.\" </p> <p>The maintenance is endless: the board only lasts until it \"loses its pop\", and the other components are all subject to various stress-related syndromes with exotic names. Further hidden expenses include specialist hoodies, T-shirts, footwear, and specialist ridiculous trousers. Not forgetting specialist kneepads, magazines and stickers. And not forgetting specialist videos, either. If you hang on in past the six-month mark, you can become a second-hand dealer. With careful crisis management, your finances may not be beyond redemption, although investing in a net startup would have been cheaper. </p> <p>After I had assembled the Hoax components, I stood back. The result looked like it was worth about a fiver; somehow it had set me back well over a ton. But, unlike yo-yo '98, I've grown into my new role as a skateboard bankroller. I've started to enjoy board life much more than I should. I know for sure that some part of my enthusiasm stems from a kind of generational transference: since pop music has become of zero consequence (we used to have respect for the top 20 in my day, I sometimes think of telling them), skateboarding represents to me a version of a counterculture. And not only to me. I've talked to other board parents who experience the same shiver as we watch from the gallery of Extreme.Com (the Norwich skate park) and secretly feed the jukebox. </p> <p>The Extreme sound system is so bad that The Clash sound exactly like they should. The accompanying clatter of urethane wheels on plywood ramps make a din not unlike that produced by mass pogoing. It takes me back. But it takes me forward, too. It keeps me in there, and it's keeping us talking when Jack's at an age - 12 - where I'm expecting shortly to become surplus to his requirements. Not that I always understand our conversations. Though I enjoy the jargon, I can't readily connect it to the specific activity. We have discussions on the merits of complex manoeuvres such as kickflips, heelflips, nose-grinds, nose-slides, ollies, nollies, tech, old skool, half-pipes, mid-pipes and full-pipes, but, to be honest, most of the time I'm none the wiser. </p> <p>\"Did you see that, dad?\" </p> <p>\"Yeah. Fantastic. What was it?\" </p> <p>\"I kickflipped into a five-o and shoved it out.\" </p> <p>\"Nice.\" </p> <p>Parents only watch. There were a few who joined in the yo-yo classes, but there's no way they are allowed to try skateboarding because: 1) adult bones aren't bendy enough; 2) only having your old man caught feeding the jukebox can embarrass your offspring more. </p> <p>When Jack puts on his Euro '99 Skateboard Championships Video for the zillionth time, my feelings are the exact opposite to those I had when Euro '98 Yo-Yo was on. I like the skateboard video. In fact, when Jack's out (skateboarding), I sometimes secretly watch it on my own. </p> <p>His body has learned to cope with multiple bruising. When he comes in with a swollen wrist, I don't need to ask how it happened. But I know he'll have been well treated in the aftermath of a shove-it-out that went wrong. An aspect of Sk8 (official spelling) culture is that teenage boys - it is a predomi nantly male thing - mix with those as young as five without embarrassment, dusting them off after a fall in an almost parental manner. </p> <p>Pro skateboard teams sometimes visit - gangs of scruffsters who are mobbed on arrival, who sign decks and T-shirts in felt marker, and it's that punk thing again. You can smell their disbelief: that by doing what they'd be doing anyway they have become celebrities making a nice living. Some of these experts are even beyond their teens. The most famous of them all, with his own PlayStation game, Tony Hawk, is over 30 , which helps put me into context. </p> <p>When we're out visiting relatives, our new pre-departure ritual is to net-surf for the location of the nearest skate park, and if there isn't one near then we're looking at a detour. Northampton, for instance, where Radlands, the nation's top venue, is situated on a remote industrial estate, isn't exactly on the way to Stoke-on-Trent where his gran lives. And Playstation, under the Westway at the top of Portobello Road, is nowhere near anyone we know, but we spend a lot of Saturdays there. </p> <p>When my tolerance wanes - there's only so much watching a dad can do, and side activities on industrial estates are minimal - I can come over heavy-handed and suggest a bit of kulture. I've established a working technique; while I get to examine, say, Tate Modern, they indulge in some Street. Street skaters are the ones who knock you over on the pavement. Outside most public buildings the architects have produced particularly challenging layouts for this. The boys find four-step drops which they assess with mathematical precision before making their maiden runs and landing on their backsides. </p> <p>On one such day, I even got Jack inside a gallery. Damien Hirst's Hymn was the draw, that and the hopeless street architecture in the immediate environs of the Saatchi gallery. On the drive home, we discussed ollies, nollies, five-os, shove-its and why a big toy might be considered to be art, which involved the use of an entirely new jargon. If we carry on like this, we might still be talking right through his teenage years. I hope so. </p> <p>\u2022 Stephen Foster's first novel, Strides, will be published in May by Faber &amp; Faber.</p>",

And not only to me. I've talked to other board parents who experience the same shiver as we watch from the gallery of Extreme.Com (the Norwich skate park) and secretly feed the jukebox. The Extreme sound system is so bad that The Clash sound exactly like they should. The accompanying clatter of urethane wheels on plywood ramps make a din not unlike that produced by mass pogoing. It takes me back. But it takes me forward, too. It keeps me in there, and it's keeping us talking when Jack's at an age - 12 - where I'm expecting shortly to become surplus to his requirements. Not that I always understand our conversations. Though I enjoy the jargon, I can't readily connect it to the specific activity. We have discussions on the merits of complex manoeuvres such as kickflips, heelflips, nose-grinds, nose-slides, ollies, nollies, tech, old skool, half-pipes, mid-pipes and full-pipes, but, to be honest, most of the time I'm none the wiser. \"Did you see that, dad?\" \"Yeah. Fantastic. What was it?\" \"I kickflipped into a five-o and shoved it out.\" \"Nice.\" Parents only watch. There were a few who joined in the yo-yo classes, but there's no way they are allowed to try skateboarding because: 1) adult bones aren't bendy enough; 2) only having your old man caught feeding the jukebox can embarrass your offspring more. When Jack puts on his Euro '99 Skateboard Championships Video for the zillionth time, my feelings are the exact opposite to those I had when Euro '98 Yo-Yo was on. I like the skateboard video. In fact, when Jack's out (skateboarding), I sometimes secretly watch it on my own. His body has learned to cope with multiple bruising. When he comes in with a swollen wrist, I don't need to ask how it happened. But I know he'll have been well treated in the aftermath of a shove-it-out that went wrong. An aspect of Sk8 (official spelling) culture is that teenage boys - it is a predomi nantly male thing - mix with those as young as five without embarrassment, dusting them off after a fall in an almost parental manner. Pro skateboard teams sometimes visit - gangs of scruffsters who are mobbed on arrival, who sign decks and T-shirts in felt marker, and it's that punk thing again. You can smell their disbelief: that by doing what they'd be doing anyway they have become celebrities making a nice living. Some of these experts are even beyond their teens. The most famous of them all, with his own PlayStation game, Tony Hawk, is over 30 , which helps put me into context. When we're out visiting relatives, our new pre-departure ritual is to net-surf for the location of the nearest skate park, and if there isn't one near then we're looking at a detour. Northampton, for instance, where Radlands, the nation's top venue, is situated on a remote industrial estate, isn't exactly on the way to Stoke-on-Trent where his gran lives. And Playstation, under the Westway at the top of Portobello Road, is nowhere near anyone we know, but we spend a lot of Saturdays there. When my tolerance wanes - there's only so much watching a dad can do, and side activities on industrial estates are minimal - I can come over heavy-handed and suggest a bit of kulture. I've established a working technique; while I get to examine, say, Tate Modern, they indulge in some Street. Street skaters are the ones who knock you over on the pavement. Outside most public buildings the architects have produced particularly challenging layouts for this. The boys find four-step drops which they assess with mathematical precision before making their maiden runs and landing on their backsides. On one such day, I even got Jack inside a gallery. Damien Hirst's Hymn was the draw, that and the hopeless street architecture in the immediate environs of the Saatchi gallery. On the drive home, we discussed ollies, nollies, five-os, shove-its and why a big toy might be considered to be art, which involved the use of an entirely new jargon. If we carry on like this, we might still be talking right through his teenage years. I hope so. \u2022 Stephen Foster's first novel, Strides, will be published in May by Faber &amp; Faber.",

      "body": "<p>They were the antithesis of the ideal 60s suburban family. Daddy went on demonstrations. Mummy waved the placard and sang the slogans. And the kids? Well, the kids tagged along with their parents, as kids do. Now, however, those banner-bearing children of the 60s and 70s are adults, and not so compliant. Many are beginning to re-examine their relationship with their radical parents. Bettina R\u00f6hl, daughter of German terrorist Ulrike Meinhof, is devoting herself to revenging the revolutionary left. She has produced photographs from 1973 showing Joschka Fischer, now Germany's cuddly green foreign minister, beating a fallen policeman, forcing Fischer to apologise for his past. </p> <p>R\u00f6hl, 38, claims to have \"suffered from the split personality of Ulrike Meinhof\" - neither a good terrorist, nor a good mother. In America, the TV sitcom Family Ties, about the conservative adult son of leftwing 60s activists, has gathered a huge following. A generation of red-diaper babies is counting the personal cost of their parents' political idealism. Thirty years ago it may have been hip to be raised by a family who abandoned middle-class materialist ambitions for socialist revolution, but it's not so cool now. </p> <p>Matt Foot, son of Paul Foot, the most prominent member of the Socialist Workers' Party, was born in 1966 - the year American bombs landed on Hanoi. His father and mother, Monica, separated when Matt was a baby. But while other divorced dads took their children to the park on Saturday afternoons, the self-confessed Bollinger Bolshevik was introducing Matt and his older brother John to political activism. </p> <p>\"We were taken on demonstrations with him at weekends,\" says Matt. \"The first was in 1973, over Chile and Pinochet. I remember holding a placard and really liking holding it. I didn't understand a word it said, but I took it home and kept it.\" </p> <p>Ask any of these children of the revolution for their earliest memories and they won't describe an intimate moment, but a public event at which their parent was prominent. </p> <p>Klaus Stein is the 43-year-old son of committed communists. \"My first word was Fidel,\" he says. \"I was learning it being wheeled along in a pram.\" In 1960, the family of four children moved to Cuba to support the revolution. \"We had just arrived, and we all went down to the Plaza de la Revolucion. There was a demonstration about the Bay of Pigs. I remember my mother being right at the front.\" </p> <p>For some, there is no such thing as a purely personal memory. America Hoffman, son of archetypal 60s radical Abbie Hoffman, remembers his last visit to his father, who died of a drug overdose in 1989. He flew to the Delaware river, where his father was fighting the construction of an aqueduct for a nuclear plant. \"He told me we'd go inner-tubing - we'd have fun. He said he'd teach me to shoot pool. That was a big deal for me: fathers have to do that kind of stuff with their kids.\" </p> <p>But dad had other plans. \"This guy picked me up from the airport and gave me this 40-page essay on the history of river battles in the Delaware area and told me to study it because I was having a press conference the next day on my activities organising youth on the Delaware.\" </p> <p>While other families were planning package tours - the joy of the suburban classes - these offspring were already sacrificing themselves to the greater socialist good. \"We didn't take holidays because my parents' life was very important,\" says Stein. \"There was all this work to be done.\" </p> <p>Matt Foot's annual outings had to cater to his father's political commitments. \"From the age of six, my brother and I went to a weekend school at the miner's holiday camp at Skegness every Easter, organised by the SWP. </p> <p>\"We used to love it because we'd play bingo in the arcades,\" he relates. \"And we'd see our dad for the whole weekend - which was nice.\" But brother John remembers it differently: \"... the full horror of the annual Skegness rally, its windswept concrete blocks. The first year we were in this dormitory with all these beds in a line. It was like being in the army.\" </p> <p>To these children, family often meant \"political family\". \"We could have 15 people coming and staying,\" says Petra Fried, 35-year-old daughter of the marxist Austrian poet Erich Fried, who settled in London. \"My dad collected mattresses from skips so they could all sleep. It was chaos. </p> <p>\"Typically, there'd be a ring on the doorbell at our house and my mother would open the door. There would be a couple of Germans with backpacks on the doorstep. 'Is this the house of Erich Fried?' they would ask. My mother would nod. 'Ah, then it is where we are staying.'\" </p> <p>But it wasn't all happy political families. John Foot remembers: \"My mum was very active in the women's lib business from the start. We, the children, would be in a separate room and they'd be sitting in a circle on chairs in the big room downstairs. We were very much on our own. We were abandoned for the cause.\" </p> <p>\"My father was terribly available to everyone except his own kids,\" reflects Petra Fried. \"I didn't feel very important in my own family. This big surrogate family took up all his time.\" </p> <p>Once the children stepped outside this close-knit circle of fellow thinkers, they could be cut off from their peers. \"I remember thinking it was exciting. But all my friends used to say, 'Oh, your parents, they're political,'\" says Jennie Bristow, whose mother and father were students during the late-60s LSE sit-ins. </p> <p>\"During Stuff the Jubilee in '77, I was in the last year at primary school,\" says Matt Foot. \"Me and this other boy, the son of a republican, wore Stuff the Jubilee badges. The school was doing a float on the jubilee. We decided not to join in. Although it was supposed to be voluntary, the teacher was really pissed off. We were forced to write about canals as punishment. That was definitely a time when I felt isolated. I wanted to join in. I probably didn't completely understand why I was saying, 'Stuff the Jubilee.' We took this principled stand primarily because our parents did.\" </p> <p>When your earliest memory of your mother is shouting slogans in the Plaza de la Revolucion, how do you rebel? You find small ways, says Fried. \"My brothers and I were discouraged from having Monopoly at home. It was considered training in capitalism. So we found a set and played it secretly in the loft by torchlight.\" </p> <p>What to other children must have seemed like heavenly freedom from adult authority, the children of the counterculture did not necessarily see as a blessing. \"My father felt any sort of repression as a parent was the same as nazism,\" says Fried. \"He didn't think it was right to restrict a child - ever. There were no boundaries. That's a very scary thing for children. Drugs, boyfriends, that was all fine. When I brought home my first boyfriend, aged 14, my mum said, 'Oh, you both better go to bed now.' He was so shocked he couldn't do it.\" </p> <p> As adults, and now as parents themselves, many of these children are now making amends. \"I have a 15-year-old daughter, and I have a horror of her experiencing the sort of chaos I did. As a result, I am obsessively organised and tidy now. I clean the house every morning, so she doesn't have to return to that chaotic environment after school,\" says Fried. </p> <p>We're all too sensible to be revolutionaries now. We want good pay and pensions, decent schools for our kids, and time to ourselves. \"Who in their right mind would travel the world with four kids in tow?\" says Stein. \"People now are much more worried about schools, security. My parents didn't care about those things.\" </p> <p>Like many of the radicals of the 60s, Stein's parents have lost their faith. \"They've become disillusioned. The socialism they had been trying to build just wasn't the way they thought it was going to be,\" he says. </p> <p>Jennie Bristow is glad her parent's passions have mellowed. \"They're not caught in the past. They're not clinging on to what they've always believed in. There's nothing worse than having parents who say, 'In our day we used to do things differently ...' and going on about it. Politics isn't what it was in the 60s. Things have moved on.\"</p>",

But, under heavy pressure from feminist groups, which see the possibility for a mother to conceal her identity as an important women's right, Ms Royale's bill - which should go before parliament this spring - does not seek to abolish the notion of maternal secrecy altogether. What it does do is foresee the creation of a centralised authority, a national council for access to personal origins, which will collate and preserve all the paperwork relating to anonymous births. If, at a later date, a child \"n\u00e9s sous X\" asks for its help, the council will contact the mother. And, providing both parties are willing, a meeting will be arranged. \"The system has been devised so that is should lead, naturally and eventually, to the end of anonymous births,\" said Ms Royale. \"At this stage, mothers who want to maintain their anonymity can do so, but they will be strongly encouraged to leave the full details of their identity in a sealed envelope with the council. \"The aim, essentially, is for every French child to have access to his history.\" Email jon.henley@theguardian.com Related special report Concorde crash Other articles More articles by Jon Henley Useful links Le Monde Lib\u00e9ration Le Figaro Le Nouvel Observateur Le Parisien Les Echos Agence France-Presse TF1 Radio France Good Morning Paris Paris web La Documentation fran\u00e7aise Political resources The Elys\u00e9e palace French prime minister's office French government",

      "body": "<p>Auberon Waugh's death at the age of 61 is more sad than surprising. His immediate heredity wasn't promising - his father died at 62 and his mother at 57 - and he suffered from ill-health all his life, partly resulting from severe wounds sustained during national service at the age of 18.</p> <p>That may, in part, have accounted for the acidic personality which made him the most verbally brutal journalist of his age. Everyone who met him remarked on the contrast between his ferocity in print and his personal geniality, but this was hard to explain to those who didn't know him, especially if they had been on the rough end of his pen.</p> <p>Apart from health, his background shaped his career in one other respect. He spent much of his life trying to escape from the shadow of his father, Evelyn Waugh, the greatest English novelist of his age. </p> <p>His first novel, The Foxglove Saga (1960), was undoubtedly promising, and was undoubtedly helped by the name Waugh. He then went up briefly to Christ Church, Oxford, to which he had won an exhibition in English, to read PPE, but left after a year. After an unsuccessful attempt to join the Foreign Office - yet another part of the establishment which earned his undying enmity - he turned the obvious way.</p> <p>His early career in Fleet Street was chequered, working briefly for the Peterborough column on the Daily Telegraph, then joining the Daily Mirror. </p> <p>In 1967, he was made political columnist of the Spectator. Waugh took his duties seriously enough, though attendance at Westminster only increased his aversion to politics and politicians. His time at the Spectator coincided with the Biafra war, when the Ibo-speaking, and largely Catholic, province seceded from Nigeria. This was the first serious cause to engage Waugh, who poured savage indignation on the Wilson government for colluding at the conduct of the war, in which millions of Africans were starved into submission.</p> <p>In 1970, Waugh abruptly left the Spectator. He had been seeing the week's issue through the press, and on a whim changed George Gale's name to \"Lunchtime O'Gale\" in the contributors' list. When Lawson sacked him, Waugh sued for wrongful dismissal. After a court case, when Bernard Levin and Alan Watkins testified on his behalf, he surprisingly won damages of \u00a3600.</p> <p>Despite this, Lawson magnanimously re-employed Waugh as a novel reviewer, where he honed his talent for vituperation, which he later and even more brilliantly practised in the obscure magazine Books &amp; Bookmen. </p> <p>In 1970 he found a natural billet at Private Eye. The diary he wrote for the Eye over the next 16 years was unique, a combination of polemic, causerie, parody and fantasy. Those who liked it thought it very funny indeed, though its technique was partly pure abuse. </p> <p>His novels include Consider the Lilies (1968), Path of Dalliance (1963), Who are the Violets Now (1966) and A Bed of Flowers (1971). </p> <p>When Ian Hislop became editor of Private Eye in 1986, Waugh left haughtily and abusively to take up the editorship of the Literary Review. Although Waugh was more prolific than ever, the columns he wrote for the Sunday Telegraph from 1980 and the Daily Telegraph from 1990 never quite matched the dash and bite of his best work for the Spectator or Eye.</p> <p>He twice won the What the Papers Say Award for Columnist of the Year.</p> <p>\u0095 Auberon Alexander Waugh, editor and writer, born November 17 1939, died January 16 2001.</p> <p><strong>\u0095 Read the full version of this obituary in tomorrow's Guardian.</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Auberon Waugh's death at the age of 61 is more sad than surprising. His immediate heredity wasn't promising - his father died at 62 and his mother at 57 - and he suffered from ill-health all his life, partly resulting from severe wounds sustained during national service at the age of 18. That may, in part, have accounted for the acidic personality which made him the most verbally brutal journalist of his age. Everyone who met him remarked on the contrast between his ferocity in print and his personal geniality, but this was hard to explain to those who didn't know him, especially if they had been on the rough end of his pen. Apart from health, his background shaped his career in one other respect. He spent much of his life trying to escape from the shadow of his father, Evelyn Waugh, the greatest English novelist of his age. His first novel, The Foxglove Saga (1960), was undoubtedly promising, and was undoubtedly helped by the name Waugh. He then went up briefly to Christ Church, Oxford, to which he had won an exhibition in English, to read PPE, but left after a year. After an unsuccessful attempt to join the Foreign Office - yet another part of the establishment which earned his undying enmity - he turned the obvious way. His early career in Fleet Street was chequered, working briefly for the Peterborough column on the Daily Telegraph, then joining the Daily Mirror. In 1967, he was made political columnist of the Spectator. Waugh took his duties seriously enough, though attendance at Westminster only increased his aversion to politics and politicians. His time at the Spectator coincided with the Biafra war, when the Ibo-speaking, and largely Catholic, province seceded from Nigeria. This was the first serious cause to engage Waugh, who poured savage indignation on the Wilson government for colluding at the conduct of the war, in which millions of Africans were starved into submission. In 1970, Waugh abruptly left the Spectator. He had been seeing the week's issue through the press, and on a whim changed George Gale's name to \"Lunchtime O'Gale\" in the contributors' list. When Lawson sacked him, Waugh sued for wrongful dismissal. After a court case, when Bernard Levin and Alan Watkins testified on his behalf, he surprisingly won damages of \u00a3600. Despite this, Lawson magnanimously re-employed Waugh as a novel reviewer, where he honed his talent for vituperation, which he later and even more brilliantly practised in the obscure magazine Books &amp; Bookmen. In 1970 he found a natural billet at Private Eye. The diary he wrote for the Eye over the next 16 years was unique, a combination of polemic, causerie, parody and fantasy. Those who liked it thought it very funny indeed, though its technique was partly pure abuse. His novels include Consider the Lilies (1968), Path of Dalliance (1963), Who are the Violets Now (1966) and A Bed of Flowers (1971). When Ian Hislop became editor of Private Eye in 1986, Waugh left haughtily and abusively to take up the editorship of the Literary Review. Although Waugh was more prolific than ever, the columns he wrote for the Sunday Telegraph from 1980 and the Daily Telegraph from 1990 never quite matched the dash and bite of his best work for the Spectator or Eye. He twice won the What the Papers Say Award for Columnist of the Year. \u0095 Auberon Alexander Waugh, editor and writer, born November 17 1939, died January 16 2001. \u0095 Read the full version of this obituary in tomorrow's Guardian.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Email message from David Maclean to the political department (3/1/00)</p> <p>In the Commons there are three separate stages we now need to consider:</p> <p>First, there will be a one-day debate on the floor of the House, probably 16th or 17th January, on the three options, followed by a vote on the options.</p> <p>We all know that the ban option will prevail. I think that this debate will be more of a discussion, in principle, of bans versus regulation or self-regulation.</p> <p>Technically, this is just a committee to consider the clauses and it would be possible to put down amendments to them. If we were to put down an amendment, for consideration during this debate, then it should be quite broad, eg delete an option, but since we will have the chance to vote on each option, that is just a gesture.</p> <p>If we could get it in order, this is a chance to float a different option, but getting the Donahue Bill into a form whereby it was an alternative option may be very difficult.</p> <p>Tactically, if we have gone public with the Donahue alternative by 12th January then we should try to run it during commons committee on the floor.</p> <p>If it is our view that we do not like any of the options but that we want comprehensive animal cruelty legislation, then we have got to try that line in the commons sometime.</p> <p>Since John Jackson has told the minister that none of the options is alliance policy, then we do need to have a go with what we think is our policy.</p> <p>So, the only legal work for this stage is to attempt to draft an alternative new clause which would be a 4th option.</p> <p>Bear in mind the long title on the fill is \"To make provision about hunting wild mammals with dogs\". No amendment or new clause can go wider than that and must be within scope.</p> <p>It may be impossible to convert the Donahue Bill into a new clause for this bill and still keep within scope of the long title. If it cannot be done or if it is decided best not to try it, then we can get through the one day on the floor without any amendment.</p> <p>Most colleagues consider that this is a day to make the speeches they failed to make on second reading and then vote in principle on the options.</p> <p>If we have an alternative option, then we will need speaking notes on it, otherwise we should have notes opposing a ban for all the reasons, supporting self-regulation and asking probing questions about the governments view of how schedule 2 would work in practice.</p> <p>The second stage is committee upstairs to consider the details of the option which gained majority support. This will be the ban option.</p> <p>If by some accident regulation wins, then we will need to move very quickly and lay genuine and sensible amendments to improve on it.</p> <p>However, it is more likely that this will be for the Lords. The first requirement for committee upstairs is that we occupy all the time available, however much that is.</p> <p>We will have to show that there was grossly inadequate time to consider the details of the ban option. Failure to scrutinise it in the commons plays well in the Lords.</p> <p>The second rule is that we must not produce amendments which expose faults in the bill which the government can then fix, thereby reducing our chances of a successful legal challenge at Strasbourg or elsewhere.</p> <p>What is our endgame? A Labour government after the election will drive through this bill unless March 18th scares them witless.</p> <p>We must work on the assumption that, in 12 months time, there will be legislation on the statute book banning hunting with dogs. I think that the banning option is impossible to enforce and, once we stir up the police about its weaknesses, they will be terrified of trying to implement it.</p> <p>However, it is absolutely vital that the legislation is as flawed and sloppy as possible. The Lords must not clean it up. I want every inconsistency, every dubiety, every ambiguity left in.</p> <p>If the law is clear, then we are finished, because most us will not break the law. However, the endgame must be that, on the day that a hunting ban comes into force, we can all turn out with our doggies to go walking, and the police and learned professors of law will all say that probably no crime is being committed because the law is so unclear.</p> <p>At that stage (post ban) there are two separate attacks; one, a legal challenge mounted under human rights legislation and two, bringing the banning legislation into disrepute by testing it to the limit and exploiting all the loopholes.</p> <p>Therefore, at this stage we must not expose nor tighten up on the loopholes.</p> <p>So, for committee upstairs, we will need lots of amendments which do not deal with fundamental weakness nor injustices in the bill.

      "bodyText": "Email message from David Maclean to the political department (3/1/00) In the Commons there are three separate stages we now need to consider: First, there will be a one-day debate on the floor of the House, probably 16th or 17th January, on the three options, followed by a vote on the options. We all know that the ban option will prevail. I think that this debate will be more of a discussion, in principle, of bans versus regulation or self-regulation. Technically, this is just a committee to consider the clauses and it would be possible to put down amendments to them. If we were to put down an amendment, for consideration during this debate, then it should be quite broad, eg delete an option, but since we will have the chance to vote on each option, that is just a gesture. If we could get it in order, this is a chance to float a different option, but getting the Donahue Bill into a form whereby it was an alternative option may be very difficult. Tactically, if we have gone public with the Donahue alternative by 12th January then we should try to run it during commons committee on the floor. If it is our view that we do not like any of the options but that we want comprehensive animal cruelty legislation, then we have got to try that line in the commons sometime. Since John Jackson has told the minister that none of the options is alliance policy, then we do need to have a go with what we think is our policy. So, the only legal work for this stage is to attempt to draft an alternative new clause which would be a 4th option. Bear in mind the long title on the fill is \"To make provision about hunting wild mammals with dogs\". No amendment or new clause can go wider than that and must be within scope. It may be impossible to convert the Donahue Bill into a new clause for this bill and still keep within scope of the long title. If it cannot be done or if it is decided best not to try it, then we can get through the one day on the floor without any amendment. Most colleagues consider that this is a day to make the speeches they failed to make on second reading and then vote in principle on the options. If we have an alternative option, then we will need speaking notes on it, otherwise we should have notes opposing a ban for all the reasons, supporting self-regulation and asking probing questions about the governments view of how schedule 2 would work in practice. The second stage is committee upstairs to consider the details of the option which gained majority support. This will be the ban option. If by some accident regulation wins, then we will need to move very quickly and lay genuine and sensible amendments to improve on it. However, it is more likely that this will be for the Lords. The first requirement for committee upstairs is that we occupy all the time available, however much that is. We will have to show that there was grossly inadequate time to consider the details of the ban option. Failure to scrutinise it in the commons plays well in the Lords. The second rule is that we must not produce amendments which expose faults in the bill which the government can then fix, thereby reducing our chances of a successful legal challenge at Strasbourg or elsewhere. What is our endgame? A Labour government after the election will drive through this bill unless March 18th scares them witless. We must work on the assumption that, in 12 months time, there will be legislation on the statute book banning hunting with dogs. I think that the banning option is impossible to enforce and, once we stir up the police about its weaknesses, they will be terrified of trying to implement it. However, it is absolutely vital that the legislation is as flawed and sloppy as possible. The Lords must not clean it up. I want every inconsistency, every dubiety, every ambiguity left in. If the law is clear, then we are finished, because most us will not break the law. However, the endgame must be that, on the day that a hunting ban comes into force, we can all turn out with our doggies to go walking, and the police and learned professors of law will all say that probably no crime is being committed because the law is so unclear. At that stage (post ban) there are two separate attacks; one, a legal challenge mounted under human rights legislation and two, bringing the banning legislation into disrepute by testing it to the limit and exploiting all the loopholes. Therefore, at this stage we must not expose nor tighten up on the loopholes. So, for committee upstairs, we will need lots of amendments which do not deal with fundamental weakness nor injustices in the bill. I will discuss with my colleagues but I think we will need a tactics meeting in the week commencing 8th January. Normally, we would let ourselves get bogged down in committee on the first few clauses and not make any progress beyond them. However, the first clauses we will deal with are on offences and penalties and it may be difficult to spend a lot of time on them and avoid issues 0.0 of substance. For the moment, the bar group should work on amendments to schedule three, some of which could be seen as wrecking amendments, but none of which, if accepted by the government, would plug a loophole we may wish to rely on later. The third phase will be report and third reading back on the floor of the house. This too will be guillotined and is likely to last only one day. We will have in front of us the bill as amended in committee upstairs and it will be another chance lay amendments to the clauses, the schedule or propose new clauses and schedules. Since the house will have voted for a banning option earlier, I do not think it will be possible to lay an amendment calling for self regulation. We might not be able to do a \"delete clause one\" amendment. Clearly we will need to lay some amendments here and compensation would be good if we can get it in order. During committee upstairs, we will spot some things to run with at report stage and I would not worry about it right now. I hope all this is helpful. Come back to me directly on e-mail or telephone 016974 78519 if you have any queries. I need to write to all supporting MPs warning them about the likelihood of an options debate on 16th or 17th.

Failure to scrutinise it in the Commons always plays well in the Lords. \"The second rule is that we must not produce amendments which expose faults in the bill which the government can fix thereby reducing our chances of a successful legal challenge at Strasbourg or elsewhere. \"We must not expose nor tighten up on the loopholes. So for the committee upstairs we will need lots of amendments that will not deal with fundamental weaknesses or injustices in the bill.\" He adds: \"The lords must not clean it up.\" An earlier report said the Countryside Alliance was being advised by Charles Moore, the editor of the Daily Telegraph, and was planning a big poster campaign. It is also looking at using civil disobedience including lodging mass appeals against local rates to clog up the system. Michael O'Brien, the Home Office minister in charge of the hunting bill, last night condemned Mr Maclean. \"This memorandum does a disservice to MPs who support his cause by seeking to undermine the integrity of Parliament by trying to introduce bad laws. David Maclean already has experience in introducing bad laws when he was a Home Office minister. Whatever option Parliament chooses tonight we shall ensure that we have the best legal advice to make sure it works.\" Special report: the hunting debate Read the memo Full email from David Maclean detailing the Tory campaign Related articles 07.01.2001: Tories plot hunt bill dirty tricks Analysis: how much do foxes really suffer?

But when she called the Allens asking to see the babies one last time for \"closure\", they felt they could not refuse. In fact, Ms Wecker and Ms Johnson drove the sisters straight to the Kilshaws' hotel in San Diego, following up with a phone call to say that the children would not be returning. Ms Johnson said Ms Wecker had changed her mind and wanted to place them with someone else, refusing to say why and ignoring the Allens' calls.</p> <p>In desperation, the Allens reported to police that the children had been kidnapped and sent Mrs Allen's brother Richard Churchill - who lived near the motel - to intercede.

It also brought out tensions between the Kilshaws and Ms Wecker, who wanted money for clothes, food and accommodation. They spent thousands of dollars on her before paying for her flight back to Missouri; hundreds more on her estranged husband, who refused to sign the adoption agreement unless he received more cash.</p> <p>Holed up in Little Rock for the 10 day cooling-off period required by Arkansas, they stayed one step ahead of the Allens, finalising the adoption with a five-minute court hearing on December 22. Satisfied that the twins were truly theirs, they changed the girls' names to Belinda and Kimberley and flew them to Britain on their American passports, as temporary visitors.</p> <p>As the new arrivals settle in at the family's seven-bedroom farm on the outskirts of Buckley, north Wales, the Kilshaws seem sanguine about the whole affair.</p> <p>They say they have had plenty of support from friends and family, including their sons James, seven, and Rupert, four, and Cayley, Mrs Kilshaw's 18-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. \"Our other children say they are beautiful and there have been no pangs of jealousy or resentment,\" Mrs Kilshaw said.</p> <p>The real question is how happy the twins will be. Sold twice to the highest bidder, chased across the United States and flown thousands of miles from their first home; their story sounds as if it comes off the Jerry Springer show, rather than from a book of fairy tales. The Kilshaws say the babies are adapting well and will learn the truth about their background when they are old enough.</p> <p>\"We are going to tell them the truth,\" Mr Kilshaw insisted. \"We are going to compile a story book of photos of their mother and sister in America. They will be told as they ask and they will be shown the story book and told the why and the how.\"</p> <p>However defiantly the Kilshaws show off the new additions to their family, the trouble is not going to go away. Their promises of cooperation may not be enough to satisfy the authorities.</p> <p>The Allens are asking the FBI to intervene and arrange the babies' return. Flintshire social services are investigating the case in detail. The Home Office must decide whether to grant the twins residency rights.</p> <p>But the Kilshaws are unrepentant. \"If anyone is thinking of adopting a child abroad, then they should contact us and we can point them in the right direction in America,\" Mr Kilshaw said yesterday.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,423382,00.html\">17.01.2001: Controversy rages over the twins sold to highest bidder</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,423309,00.html\">17.01.2001: Two sets of parents paid.

As the new arrivals settle in at the family's seven-bedroom farm on the outskirts of Buckley, north Wales, the Kilshaws seem sanguine about the whole affair. They say they have had plenty of support from friends and family, including their sons James, seven, and Rupert, four, and Cayley, Mrs Kilshaw's 18-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. \"Our other children say they are beautiful and there have been no pangs of jealousy or resentment,\" Mrs Kilshaw said. The real question is how happy the twins will be. Sold twice to the highest bidder, chased across the United States and flown thousands of miles from their first home; their story sounds as if it comes off the Jerry Springer show, rather than from a book of fairy tales. The Kilshaws say the babies are adapting well and will learn the truth about their background when they are old enough. \"We are going to tell them the truth,\" Mr Kilshaw insisted. \"We are going to compile a story book of photos of their mother and sister in America. They will be told as they ask and they will be shown the story book and told the why and the how.\" However defiantly the Kilshaws show off the new additions to their family, the trouble is not going to go away. Their promises of cooperation may not be enough to satisfy the authorities. The Allens are asking the FBI to intervene and arrange the babies' return. Flintshire social services are investigating the case in detail. The Home Office must decide whether to grant the twins residency rights. But the Kilshaws are unrepentant. \"If anyone is thinking of adopting a child abroad, then they should contact us and we can point them in the right direction in America,\" Mr Kilshaw said yesterday.

      "byline": "Ronald Bergan",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the 1950s, independent film companies emerged to break the hold of the big studios; with the changes in the status of actors, producers and directors, they would eventually destroy the studio system. They were able to tackle more daring subjects, delving into areas that Hollywood had previously shied away from.</p> <p>Among the first was the production company Hill-Hecht-Lancaster. Lancaster was Burt, who gained greater independence by going freelance and becoming a producer himself; Hecht was Harold, the agent who had discovered Lancaster and brought him to Hollywood; and James Hill, who has died aged 84, completed the trio.</p> <p>Hill met Lancaster and Hecht when he co-wrote the screenplay for the South Sea island romp His Majesty O'Keefe (1954). Two years later, his name was appended to Hecht-Lancaster, a partnership which lasted until 1960, after having produced some choice movies, including Sweet Smell of Success, arguably their best film.</p> <p>The son of an Indiana lawyer, Hill got his first job in show business as a page for NBC in New York. He soon started writing for the network, and later wrote and produced the popular weekly radio comedy Beulah. He went to Hollywood as a contract screenwriter for MGM studios, though he worked on their less prestigious productions, one being The Hoodlum Saint (1946), starring William Powell and Esther Williams.</p> <p>After the propitious meeting with Lancaster and Hecht, he concentrated on production, being the sole producer on Robert Aldrich's western, Vera Cruz (1954), in which the biggest selling point was the equal top billing of contrasting stars - the laconic, unsmiling Gary Cooper and the energetic, broadly grinning Lancaster.</p> <p>Gina Lollobrigida, in a spangled costume, was the lovely bone of contention between circus performers Lancaster and Tony Curtis in Carol Reed's Trapeze (1956), which Hill produced successfully.

      "bodyText": "In the 1950s, independent film companies emerged to break the hold of the big studios; with the changes in the status of actors, producers and directors, they would eventually destroy the studio system. They were able to tackle more daring subjects, delving into areas that Hollywood had previously shied away from. Among the first was the production company Hill-Hecht-Lancaster. Lancaster was Burt, who gained greater independence by going freelance and becoming a producer himself; Hecht was Harold, the agent who had discovered Lancaster and brought him to Hollywood; and James Hill, who has died aged 84, completed the trio. Hill met Lancaster and Hecht when he co-wrote the screenplay for the South Sea island romp His Majesty O'Keefe (1954). Two years later, his name was appended to Hecht-Lancaster, a partnership which lasted until 1960, after having produced some choice movies, including Sweet Smell of Success, arguably their best film. The son of an Indiana lawyer, Hill got his first job in show business as a page for NBC in New York. He soon started writing for the network, and later wrote and produced the popular weekly radio comedy Beulah. He went to Hollywood as a contract screenwriter for MGM studios, though he worked on their less prestigious productions, one being The Hoodlum Saint (1946), starring William Powell and Esther Williams. After the propitious meeting with Lancaster and Hecht, he concentrated on production, being the sole producer on Robert Aldrich's western, Vera Cruz (1954), in which the biggest selling point was the equal top billing of contrasting stars - the laconic, unsmiling Gary Cooper and the energetic, broadly grinning Lancaster. Gina Lollobrigida, in a spangled costume, was the lovely bone of contention between circus performers Lancaster and Tony Curtis in Carol Reed's Trapeze (1956), which Hill produced successfully. Also starring Lancaster and Curtis was Alexander MacKendrick's Sweet Smell of Success. A good $2.5m was reaped from Separate Tables (1958), derived from Terence Rattigan's two inter-connected one-act plays. Among the guests at a genteel seaside boarding house was journalist Burt Lancaster and his glamorous ex-wife Rita Hayworth, who wanted him back. In the same year, Hill became Hayworth's fifth and final husband, following businessman Edward Judson, Orson Welles, Aly Khan and crooner Dick Haymes. The marriage lasted the statutory two years, but the couple remained good friends. According to Hill's autobiography, they had met twice some years before, once in Mexico as teenagers, when Hill thought Hayworth a prostitute, and later in Los Angeles, when the she mistook him for a cleaning man. Among the last Hecht-Hill-Lancaster productions were Run Silent, Run Deep (1958), a claustrophobic submarine drama with a compulsive profile-to-profile confrontation between Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster, and The Devil's Disciple (1959), co-produced with Kirk Douglas's company Bryna, though George Bernard Shaw's ironic comedy of British colonialism did not lend itself to the realistic approach. The final Hecht-Hill-Lancaster movie was John Huston's The Unforgiven (1960), with Lancaster fighting Indians, despite Audrey Hepburn being an Indian girl, adopted as a baby by Burt's mother (Lillian Gish), and passed off as white. Branching out on his own, Hill produced The Happy Thieves (1961), shot in Spain. It had an uneasy star pairing in Rex Harrison and Rita Hayworth as two art thieves attempting to steal a priceless Goya from the Prado in Madrid. Needless to say, the robbery, like the film, failed to come off. At the same time, Hill and Hayworth's marriage had crumbled, his explanation being that he forced her to continue making movies when she wanted both of them to retire. He never remarried. Sadly, like his former wife, Hill died suffering from Alzheimer's disease. \u0095 James Hill, film producer, born August 1 1916; died January 11 2001",

A home study report is prepared by a social worker after interviews to explore the parents' background and reasons for adopting from overseas.

Although the government prefers this to be done through official channels in the child's country of origin, there is no legal obstacle to private arrangements. Procedures are easier if the adoptive parents look in a \"designated country\" whose adoptions are recognised under UK law. That allows the adoption process to be completed overseas.

An application for British citizenship can be submitted afterwards. The Home Office said admission to the UK would not be automatic if the child had an interim adoption order, as appeared to be the case for the twins brought in by the Kilshaws.

      "bodyText": "Shares in ONdigital owners Granada Media and Carlton Communications fell this morning as the pay-TV service failed to ignite the market with its quarterly statement. Despite reaching its target of 1m customers, analysts had strong reservations about ONdigital's churn rate and the \"clean\" number of subscribers. ONdigital's customer base is only 975,000 when the 37,000 users who have yet to switch on their service are stripped out of the figures. \"If ONdigital are going to get to 2m by the end of 2002 then they will have to step up the roll-out, and will no doubt be praying for an announcement on the analogue switch-off,\" said Anthony de Larrinaga, analyst at SG Securities. The lack of outstanding news in the statement and a number of recent downgrades pushed Granada down 1% to 399.5p, with Carlton slipping 2% to 549.5p. Other analysts expressed concern that ONdigital's churn rate - or the number of subscribers joining rival broadcasters - will benefit arch-competitor BSkyB, which already has 4m digital customers. Any evidence of the so-called \"nursery slope\" to BSkyB would damage investor confidence in a future ONdigital flotation. \"ONdigital say the churn rate is between 15% and 20%, but it is clearly nearer to 20%.

It has always sought to \"campaign and educate\" as well as help children and their families directly.

All this is in the accounts, as are the examples below. </p> <p>Just over \u00a332m was spent on services to children and their families.

      "body": "<p>Would John Major really have won the 1997 general election if Labour and the Tories had been able to agree on a television debate between him and Blair? The thought seems preposterous today, but that is what Major believed back then. Arguing for such a debate, he said he wanted the chance to cross-question Blair without notes, so that his own \"command of detail\" would be apparent.</p> <p>Leaving aside, if I may, the dreadful final scene in the horror movie when the government that gave us Railtrack might have risen from the dead, John Major seems both to have over-estimated the attractions of his personality and misperceived what succeeds on television.</p> <p>Command of detail may be a fine thing in a prime minister - always assuming that's not all he has to offer - but it's a killer on television. What succeeds on TV is Ronald Reagan.</p> <p>Now, with another election in the near offing, the question of a televised campaign debate between party leaders is an issue again. The broadcasters are keen, Labour and the Tories bicker over the format, the Lib Dems are jumping up and down in the corner shouting \"me too\" and the Dimblebys, no doubt, are having their best suits cleaned in anticipation of a starring role. Once the gauntlet has been thrown, whoever fails to pick it up risks looking chicken.</p> <p>All of this, though, misses the point: good television and good politics are not and have never been the same thing. To choose a government on the outcome of a televised debate between the leaders makes as much sense as choosing a school on the basis that the head teacher can tap-dance.</p> <p>Party leaders should, of course, argue about politics, and they do - once a week in the Commons in prime minister's questions, to name only the most obvious occasion. It's a ritual that tells us much more, over time, about their respective abilities in the political art of scoring points than a TV debate would.

      "bodyText": "Would John Major really have won the 1997 general election if Labour and the Tories had been able to agree on a television debate between him and Blair? The thought seems preposterous today, but that is what Major believed back then. Arguing for such a debate, he said he wanted the chance to cross-question Blair without notes, so that his own \"command of detail\" would be apparent. Leaving aside, if I may, the dreadful final scene in the horror movie when the government that gave us Railtrack might have risen from the dead, John Major seems both to have over-estimated the attractions of his personality and misperceived what succeeds on television. Command of detail may be a fine thing in a prime minister - always assuming that's not all he has to offer - but it's a killer on television. What succeeds on TV is Ronald Reagan. Now, with another election in the near offing, the question of a televised campaign debate between party leaders is an issue again. The broadcasters are keen, Labour and the Tories bicker over the format, the Lib Dems are jumping up and down in the corner shouting \"me too\" and the Dimblebys, no doubt, are having their best suits cleaned in anticipation of a starring role. Once the gauntlet has been thrown, whoever fails to pick it up risks looking chicken. All of this, though, misses the point: good television and good politics are not and have never been the same thing. To choose a government on the outcome of a televised debate between the leaders makes as much sense as choosing a school on the basis that the head teacher can tap-dance. Party leaders should, of course, argue about politics, and they do - once a week in the Commons in prime minister's questions, to name only the most obvious occasion. It's a ritual that tells us much more, over time, about their respective abilities in the political art of scoring points than a TV debate would.

      "body": "<p>Government attempts to bring in minimum standards in care homes for the elderly have been welcomed by the voluntary sector but there are concerns some of the new standards could be watered down.</p> <p>Fit for the Future?, a consultation paper from the Department of Health published in the autumn of 1999, made several proposals on the physical environment of care homes and other areas, such as training and staffing levels. The proposed standards are part of the implementation of the Care Standards Act.</p> <p>But last November health minister John Hutton said one of the key changes affecting the number of shared rooms homes could offer would not come into force until 2007, rather than 2002 as initially planned.</p> <p>The move was triggered by government concern at the shrinking number of nursing home beds in some regions, particularly the south-east, where rising property prices and stagnant local authority fees have encouraged some smaller care home owners to sell up.</p> <p>The government had said that by April 2002 no care home should have more than 25% of its rooms shared. But care home owners successfully lobbied ministers to delay the change, arguing that the already parlous financial state of many homes would be made worse if this change was pushed through quickly.</p> <p>The decision to delay implementation of the shared rooms standard has been criticised by organisations including the Association of Directors of Social Services.</p> <p>But some charities support the postponement. Steve Lowe, community care policy officer at Age Concern England, said he expected that there would be a delay in the measure, and accepted that care homes needed time to adapt. But he was critical of a government decision to reduce the planned minimum space standard for rooms, from 10 to 9.3 square metres, in the case of homes that have particularly large communal areas.</p> <p>He added that he was concerned that plans for local compacts between councils and care home providers, aimed at ensuring there are enough nursing home beds in the locality, do not become an excuse for local authorities to try to drive down fee levels even further.</p> <p>\"We don't want old people to have to be moved to homes far away from where they have lived because that's difficult for them and makes it harder for relatives to visit,\" he said.</p> <p>There has been criticism of the government for the tardy announcement of formal proposals that Fit for the Future? consulted on.</p> <p>Les Bright, deputy chief executive of Counsel and Care, which campaigns for the rights of older people in long-term care, said he was frustrated by delays: \"The consultation closed in January last year but the government has still not announced detailed standards in many of the areas covered by the draft proposals.\"</p> <p>Like many in the voluntary sector, Mr Bright argues that fee levels are a crucial issue in the debate on raising standards. \"The public sector is the main purchaser of care and current fee levels are far too low and the government really needs to address this issue.\"</p> <p>David Sargent, quality manager at Methodist Homes for the Aged, which runs 41 care homes, agreed: \"Local authorities simply do not pay what we need to provide high-quality care.\"</p> <p>The charity subsidises the shortfall in what it receives from local authorities from its voluntary income and Mr Sargent said he agreed with the National Care Homes Association that an extra \u00a350 a week would be needed to ensure good quality care.</p> <p>He added: \"We are striving to ensure our homes comply with the new standards and in the main we believe they will, although there will be some remodelling needed.\"</p>",

Fit for the Future?, a consultation paper from the Department of Health published in the autumn of 1999, made several proposals on the physical environment of care homes and other areas, such as training and staffing levels. The proposed standards are part of the implementation of the Care Standards Act. But last November health minister John Hutton said one of the key changes affecting the number of shared rooms homes could offer would not come into force until 2007, rather than 2002 as initially planned. The move was triggered by government concern at the shrinking number of nursing home beds in some regions, particularly the south-east, where rising property prices and stagnant local authority fees have encouraged some smaller care home owners to sell up. The government had said that by April 2002 no care home should have more than 25% of its rooms shared. But care home owners successfully lobbied ministers to delay the change, arguing that the already parlous financial state of many homes would be made worse if this change was pushed through quickly. The decision to delay implementation of the shared rooms standard has been criticised by organisations including the Association of Directors of Social Services. But some charities support the postponement. Steve Lowe, community care policy officer at Age Concern England, said he expected that there would be a delay in the measure, and accepted that care homes needed time to adapt. But he was critical of a government decision to reduce the planned minimum space standard for rooms, from 10 to 9.3 square metres, in the case of homes that have particularly large communal areas. He added that he was concerned that plans for local compacts between councils and care home providers, aimed at ensuring there are enough nursing home beds in the locality, do not become an excuse for local authorities to try to drive down fee levels even further. \"We don't want old people to have to be moved to homes far away from where they have lived because that's difficult for them and makes it harder for relatives to visit,\" he said. There has been criticism of the government for the tardy announcement of formal proposals that Fit for the Future? consulted on. Les Bright, deputy chief executive of Counsel and Care, which campaigns for the rights of older people in long-term care, said he was frustrated by delays: \"The consultation closed in January last year but the government has still not announced detailed standards in many of the areas covered by the draft proposals.\" Like many in the voluntary sector, Mr Bright argues that fee levels are a crucial issue in the debate on raising standards. \"The public sector is the main purchaser of care and current fee levels are far too low and the government really needs to address this issue.\" David Sargent, quality manager at Methodist Homes for the Aged, which runs 41 care homes, agreed: \"Local authorities simply do not pay what we need to provide high-quality care.\" The charity subsidises the shortfall in what it receives from local authorities from its voluntary income and Mr Sargent said he agreed with the National Care Homes Association that an extra \u00a350 a week would be needed to ensure good quality care. He added: \"We are striving to ensure our homes comply with the new standards and in the main we believe they will, although there will be some remodelling needed.\"",

      "body": "<p>The television personality Dale Winton has demanded a fee of almost \u00a3100,000 from the BBC to present a quiz show connected with the charity event Comic Relief. </p> <p>Some BBC insiders are surprised that the corporation has agreed to pay the presenter, who will star in a special series of a show designed to raise the profile of the fundraising event. </p> <p>Other personalities and workers involved with Comic Relief are giving their time free, but the BBC and Winton's agents stressed that his work on the game show was as part of a peak time series, not just Red Nose Day. </p> <p>Winton has agreed to grant a discount from his usual fee, but the Guardian understands he will still receive more than \u00a390,000. </p> <p>He will front a special edition of the quiz show 2000-1, in which, when it ran last year, contestants competed to win a year off work. </p> <p>In the charity edition, called 1000-1, Winton will front five 30 minute episodes on consecutive Saturdays running up to Red Nose Day on March 16, with a final during the main Comic Relief show. </p> <p>For the programme, 1,000 contestants are whittled down to a team of finalists. Prizes will be donated by Comic Relief sponsors, and the show - like a planned celebrity version of Big Brother - is designed to publicise the charity event. </p> <p>Traditionally, performers give their time free for events such as Comic Relief and Children in Need. Presenters of the Comic Relief show on March 16 will not receive a fee for their involvement. </p> <p>Winton, 45, who found fame relatively late in his career as the presenter of ITV's Supermarket Sweep, already has a lucrative contract with the BBC that prevents him from working for other channels. </p> <p>The BBC stressed that Winton would be presenting five shows on consecutive Saturdays outside the Comic Relief evening. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \"It is a formatted, peak time TV show. It is slightly different to just the Comic Relief night. It's a commitment, a five night show, a series in its own right.\" </p> <p>But she conceded that the programme was directly linked to Comic Relief. </p> <p>\"It's a BBC programme in conjunction with Comic Relief, there are constant references to Red Nose Day and to the fund line number in the programme.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Dale Winton's agents, Billy Marsh Associates, said: \"If an artist is going on the main Comic Relief show, they normally waive their fees. </p> <p>\"But if they do a series, whatever that series may be, they may get a fee depending on their time and commitment. This is not just a one-off show, it's a whole series which is taking peak-time slots.\" </p> <p>Find breaking media news at <a href=\"http://www.mediatheguardian.com\">www.mediatheguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The television personality Dale Winton has demanded a fee of almost \u00a3100,000 from the BBC to present a quiz show connected with the charity event Comic Relief. Some BBC insiders are surprised that the corporation has agreed to pay the presenter, who will star in a special series of a show designed to raise the profile of the fundraising event. Other personalities and workers involved with Comic Relief are giving their time free, but the BBC and Winton's agents stressed that his work on the game show was as part of a peak time series, not just Red Nose Day. Winton has agreed to grant a discount from his usual fee, but the Guardian understands he will still receive more than \u00a390,000. He will front a special edition of the quiz show 2000-1, in which, when it ran last year, contestants competed to win a year off work. In the charity edition, called 1000-1, Winton will front five 30 minute episodes on consecutive Saturdays running up to Red Nose Day on March 16, with a final during the main Comic Relief show. For the programme, 1,000 contestants are whittled down to a team of finalists. Prizes will be donated by Comic Relief sponsors, and the show - like a planned celebrity version of Big Brother - is designed to publicise the charity event. Traditionally, performers give their time free for events such as Comic Relief and Children in Need. Presenters of the Comic Relief show on March 16 will not receive a fee for their involvement. Winton, 45, who found fame relatively late in his career as the presenter of ITV's Supermarket Sweep, already has a lucrative contract with the BBC that prevents him from working for other channels. The BBC stressed that Winton would be presenting five shows on consecutive Saturdays outside the Comic Relief evening. A spokeswoman said: \"It is a formatted, peak time TV show. It is slightly different to just the Comic Relief night. It's a commitment, a five night show, a series in its own right.\" But she conceded that the programme was directly linked to Comic Relief. \"It's a BBC programme in conjunction with Comic Relief, there are constant references to Red Nose Day and to the fund line number in the programme.\" A spokeswoman for Dale Winton's agents, Billy Marsh Associates, said: \"If an artist is going on the main Comic Relief show, they normally waive their fees. \"But if they do a series, whatever that series may be, they may get a fee depending on their time and commitment. This is not just a one-off show, it's a whole series which is taking peak-time slots.\" Find breaking media news at www.mediatheguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Barclays bank, whose reputation was repeatedly dragged through the mud last year, has decided to ditch its life and pensions brands. It will instead sell Legal &amp; General-branded investment products through its branches. The bank - which faced a barrage of negative media coverage after closing rural branches, double-charging Link customers and offering its chief executive a \u00a330.5m performance bonus - has decided to stop marketing the Barclays Life, Barclays Funds and the b2 investment account brands altogether. It will gradually transfer customers to L&amp;G products with the accompanying loss of 750 jobs in London and the south-east. Instead Barclays will start selling L&amp;G-branded life and pension products in its branches from April 1. Legal &amp; General has a strongly trusted brand in its market. It has won Management Today magazine's 'most admired insurance company' award for three years running. A spokeswoman said the bank was shifting from own-branded products to becoming a 'financial supermarket'. While it continues to market its basic banking, investment and credit card products, it is now pushing mortgages through its recently-acquired Woolwich brand. The spokeswoman denied that the Barclays brand was 'tarnished' pointing to heavy acquisition of banking customers over the past year. She said the rationale behind the move was driven by cheaper distribution through L&amp;G's low cost base and the changing rules on selling pensions with the introduction of the stakeholder standards in April. However she admitted that the bank now pursued a policy of promoting \"the best brands for our customers\". The demise of b2 is a particular blow to Barclays' pride. The brand was launched in a blaze of advertising, featuring actor Richard E Grant, in 1998. It hoped a new sub-brand backed by the Barclays name would forge a new category of savings account.",

Never again, it suggests, can Hague claim the \"moral high ground\". </p> <p>But a small donation four years ago is pretty negligible when compared with the shameless wooing of Dirty Desmond by our clean-living, church-going prime minister.

Hence the appearance on his website of nude photos of Grace, a 79-year-old woman who would like to meet men under the age of 20 for sex.

Women such as Karen of Croydon, who admits that \"I have always been fat and a little shy. I always thought that men would not find me attractive. I am poor too. I live in a horrid little room and I don't work because I can't find a job. It's pretty miserable really ... Until a week ago I was still a virgin.\" Then Desmond's tireless social-workers came to the rescue. \"When the time came for the photographer to fuck me I was so wet he didn't need to bother with foreplay.\" </p> <p>It isn't only in the UK that Desmond performs his little deeds of kindness. He has an ethical foreign policy too. As a blurb on the website notes, \"It's hard to believe that we found Shaheeda in the slums of Bombay in India. She was begging in the streets so we offered her $100 to strip for us.\" Now hear her reaction as Desmond's special envoys distribute much-needed clothing: \"Oh, these clothes are so soft.

Proper advice is needed so that she can stand on her own two feet - preferably with legs akimbo. \"As a beggar, men never ask you for sex,\" she says. \"If I could earn money having sex, I would. It is not easy to appear sexy when you are dressed in rags and cannot wash. I don't know how to thank you for this day.\" </p> <p>Moved by her gratitude, Desmond's men reach for their wallets again. \"We gave Shaheeda an extra $100,\" they reveal, \"because she let all of us fuck her.

      "body": "<p>Nottingham boasts that it is one of Britain's five most prosperous cities, with enough job vacancies to cater for all its unemployed. But, like all big cities, there are pockets of acute deprivation. In run-down neighbourhoods, unemployment among ethnic minorities is almost 25%. Burglary and car crime - often drug related - run at twice the national average. And the city has some of the nation's worst performing schools. </p> <p>How do you engage the alienated and socially excluded in a programme of urban renewal? It's a question at the forefront of ministers' minds, following the launch this week of the government's neighbourhood renewal action plan. But it's one that Nottingham's civic leaders have long been wrestling with. </p> <p>Nottingham council spends \u00a345m each year. Yet throwing money at the problem is not enough, says John Taylor, a councillor who also chairs Nottingham health authority. \"The one-size-fits-all and the we-know-best approach of the local government authority was not working.\" </p> <p>The city's Radford and Hyson Green inner-city districts have been the focus of repeated regeneration programmes for 25 years. \"Yet they are no better today than they were, and are still the most deprived areas of the city,\" Taylor says. \"We were doing it all wrong. Everything was top down, imposed and property-focused, rather than home grown. We had to look at regeneration differently. </p> <p>\"There was a need for a level of devolved local decision-making below local government - you might call it an urban parallel council.\" </p> <p>A partnership council (PC) covering four inner-city wards was launched as an independent, limited company after consultation with some 900 households. It has proved an effective vehicle for channelling European grants worth \u00a35.4m. At the heart of the PC are seven forums: three for residents and one each for the business, voluntary, public and local government sectors. Three representatives from each make joint decisions at the PC's monthly board meetings. </p> <p>The PC's chairman, Richard Hawthorne, a local printing company director, says that what makes the body effective is its emphasis on \"honest conversation\" in order to improve service delivery. The phrase is stock-in-trade in the US, particularly in reference to inter-racial dialogue. Hawthorne is an activist with Hope in the Cities (Hic), a coalition initiated in Richmond, Virginia, which aims to promote honest conversation on race, reconciliation and responsibility. Two years ago, Hic advised President Clinton's initiative on inter-racial understanding. </p> <p>In Britain, Hic has offices in London and Liverpool and emphasises \"creating trust-based relationships where all are valued and everyone is empowered to fulfil their potential\", according to coordinator Lawrence Fearon. His colleague, Gerald Henderson, says Hic acts \"as a support network for others who are taking initiatives\". </p> <p>In Nottingham, the PC's working groups provide a natural vehicle for honest conversation. Hawthorne says: \"There is much that goes on in our cities that is not honest and there is so much griping. Honest conversation is not just a question of venting hurts, but being honest about one's own situation, feelings and mistakes. This needs to be done with a sensitivity to where the other person is coming from - and being aware of historic hurts and the drive to control which so often undermines inclusion.\" </p> <p>Honest conversation has worked at Build, a mentoring programme for black teenagers, which occupies the top floor of a converted textile factory in Radford. Half a dozen state-of-the-art computers, with video editing, give the teenagers a chance to learn IT skills. A staff of 14, supported by some 80 volunteer mentors, helped 300 people last year and the numbers are rising. Build's chief executive, Michael Henry, says this has helped several go on to higher education. </p> <p>Henry's relationship with the PC has not always been plain sailing, however. At one point, frustration boiled over and he began to walk out. At that moment, Hawthorne spoke about the need for honest conversation. Henry says he found the phrase so riveting it stopped him in his tracks and he stayed. </p> <p>Build successfully delivered the PC's cross-cultural networks project. This persuaded the Home Office to award Build a \u00a3182,000 \"connecting communities\" grant, which will extend the networks project throughout the city. Henry says: \"There is huge potential in bringing together groups as diverse as Polish, Ukrainian, Italian, Vietnamese, Asian and black communities, to talk about their experiences and be empowered to suggest what is right for their communities.\" </p> <p>The emphasis on grassroots empowerment is at the heart of the PC and its greatest success is in delivering a local agenda, says its coordinator, Christina Ashworth. She singles out action to tackle street crime. Honest conversation revealed that residents wanted to go \"beyond more bars, more locks, more lights\", says Ashworth, and wanted to see diversionary activities for young people. Youth clubs run in forbidding old school buildings were not attracting teenagers off the streets. But asking them what they wanted led to a summer sports programme in their neighbourhoods, with plenty of equipment provided. </p> <p>Residents also called for \"restorative justice\", which takes young offenders to meet their victims and make reparations - a salutary experience when they see the harm they have done, and a strong disincentive against future crime. </p> <p>Residents were not just looking for a change in infrastructure, Ashworth points out. \"They were saying these are our kids, or our neighbours' kids. It is a different view when you live in a place than living outside and providing services to it.\" </p> <p>According to Adrian Dewhurst, who co-ordinates the PC's business forum, involving some 200 local enterprises, tackling social exclusion is \"the hinge issue for Britain\". Businesses are attracted initially by the benefits they see accruing to them, such as Retail Renaissance, a \u00a32.3m retail redevelopment programme. \"But then you get them to think of the wider community, how to make the place safer to live in,\" Dewhurst says. \"You start to touch on their conscience - not just what you get out of it, but what you put into the wider community.\" </p> <p>Hawthorne's Printers is cited by the Institute for Public Policy Research, the pro-Labour thinktank, as a good example of \"corporate social engagement\", the government's new catchphrase for business commitment to social inclusion. The company donates pallets of paper to local schools, welcomes classes to visit the plant and provides work experience for eight schools and colleges. Even so, Hawthorne admits that too few of the company's 90 employees come from the inner city. </p> <p>He insists that honest conversation must continue between the PC and local residents, especially where there are continuing feelings of exclusion. For Ashworth, the bottom line is not outputs, bar charts and buildings, so much as doing things \"in a way that enhances people's dignity and makes them feel included and respected\". She would like the government to take a close look at Nottingham's experience. She thinks it might have a thing or two to learn. </p> <p> \u0095 Michael Smith is managing editor of For A Change magazine, which focuses on conflict resolution in international and community relations.</p>",

      "body": "<p> The highly publicised attack on presiding judge Ann Goddard QC by a defendant at the Old Bailey has caused widespread shock. Yet for many social care staff, being punched, kicked, spat at and verbally abused is all part of the job. </p> <p>Next week, the government is expected to take a long-awaited stand against what some see as the open season declared on social workers by clients, and the wider public, when a national taskforce on violence announces its recommendations. </p> <p>The taskforce - set up in September 1999 by former health secretary Frank Dobson after the murder of south London social worker Jenny Morrison - is expected to call for social services departments to improve safety and support for staff. Morrison, who was stabbed to death by a mental health client in 1998, joined Jonathan Newby, who was fatally attacked in 1993, Katie Sullivan, in 1992, and Isabel Schwartz, Norma Morris, Frances Betteridge and Audrey Johnson - all in the 1980s - on the roll of social care staff killed at work. </p> <p>But how safe are social workers today? Owen Davies, a former social worker and now national officer for Unison, the public services union, has been at the end of a fist himself. \"It is inconceivable that there will be a social worker who hasn't experienced actual violence, or threat of violence, which leads people to be worried about their safety,\" he says. \"The threat of violence and the worry about one's personal safety, or for one's family, does have an impact on the way social workers relate to the job. </p> <p>\"But there are real differences depending on where social care staff work. Social care workers who work in establishments where there's a large number of people, say, with dementia, know that some of the people they deal with are not really in control of their behaviour, and that means they occasionally lash out. But a social worker out at night, visiting clients in their own home, who is threatened with a vicious dog or having the tyres of their car slashed, is a different matter - and it is totally unacceptable.\" </p> <p>There is no central bank of information on the number of threats, physical and verbal assaults and serious racial abuse directed at social workers. While guidelines exist within social services departments, local authorities are not compelled to hold such data. The first port of call for disgruntled staff who have exhausted local authority procedures is usually their union. </p> <p>In January 1999, Essex Unison helped former residential worker Valerie Spurgeon to secure \u00a3103,000 compensation from the criminal injuries compensation board after she intervened in a fight at the children's home where she worked. Six years on, Spurgeon still believes lack of support from the council robbed her of a career. </p> <p>Despite seriously bruised ribs, breast tissue damage and bruises \"from head to toe\", Spurgeon was denied time off because of staff shortages. She collapsed at work the following day, and for six months suffered post traumatic shock.

      "bodyText": "The highly publicised attack on presiding judge Ann Goddard QC by a defendant at the Old Bailey has caused widespread shock. Yet for many social care staff, being punched, kicked, spat at and verbally abused is all part of the job. Next week, the government is expected to take a long-awaited stand against what some see as the open season declared on social workers by clients, and the wider public, when a national taskforce on violence announces its recommendations. The taskforce - set up in September 1999 by former health secretary Frank Dobson after the murder of south London social worker Jenny Morrison - is expected to call for social services departments to improve safety and support for staff. Morrison, who was stabbed to death by a mental health client in 1998, joined Jonathan Newby, who was fatally attacked in 1993, Katie Sullivan, in 1992, and Isabel Schwartz, Norma Morris, Frances Betteridge and Audrey Johnson - all in the 1980s - on the roll of social care staff killed at work. But how safe are social workers today? Owen Davies, a former social worker and now national officer for Unison, the public services union, has been at the end of a fist himself. \"It is inconceivable that there will be a social worker who hasn't experienced actual violence, or threat of violence, which leads people to be worried about their safety,\" he says. \"The threat of violence and the worry about one's personal safety, or for one's family, does have an impact on the way social workers relate to the job. \"But there are real differences depending on where social care staff work. Social care workers who work in establishments where there's a large number of people, say, with dementia, know that some of the people they deal with are not really in control of their behaviour, and that means they occasionally lash out. But a social worker out at night, visiting clients in their own home, who is threatened with a vicious dog or having the tyres of their car slashed, is a different matter - and it is totally unacceptable.\" There is no central bank of information on the number of threats, physical and verbal assaults and serious racial abuse directed at social workers. While guidelines exist within social services departments, local authorities are not compelled to hold such data. The first port of call for disgruntled staff who have exhausted local authority procedures is usually their union. In January 1999, Essex Unison helped former residential worker Valerie Spurgeon to secure \u00a3103,000 compensation from the criminal injuries compensation board after she intervened in a fight at the children's home where she worked. Six years on, Spurgeon still believes lack of support from the council robbed her of a career. Despite seriously bruised ribs, breast tissue damage and bruises \"from head to toe\", Spurgeon was denied time off because of staff shortages. She collapsed at work the following day, and for six months suffered post traumatic shock. She has not worked since. \"I'm still being prescribed anti-depressants by my GP even now,\" says Spurgeon. \"It was just hell. It started off initially as a fight between the brother and sister, then the sister decided she wanted to kill the brother. She was strangling him and he was turning blue and couldn't breathe. For about two hours, me and my colleague were kicked, beaten, bit, punched and threatened with knives. It was a very traumatic experience.

A Cabinet Office spokeswoman says: \"The government is not doing any particular research into this age group. The strategy as it stands at the moment is definitely aimed at young people, and the research we have commissioned looks towards that.\" Drug services take a similar approach, mainly targeting white, male opiate users aged 25-35. </p> <p>Contrary to official mythology, however, it is possible to spend decades taking drugs and still survive relatively intact. But because being old and being a drug user are viewed as mutually exclusive by so many agencies, getting the right support and services is very difficult. </p> <p>\"Those who don't know you're a user just treat you as old, and once they find out you're a user, you're not allowed to be old any more because your identity as a drug user takes over,\" says Carla, who wishes to remain anonymous but lives in London and is a stable methadone user a few years off her 60th birthday. \"I don't want to be treated as either one. All I want is to be treated like a human being.\" </p> <p>She believes that an agency geared specifically to drug users over the age of 55, coordinating services and medical support both for drug and age-related conditions, would fill a real gap. </p> <p>\"At the moment, if I slip on the ice and break my leg, the doctor doesn't say it's because I'm a wobbly old person who slipped on the ice, but assumes I slipped because I was stoned,\" says Carla. \"My file at the dentist has 'drug addict' emblazoned across the front cover so no one can fail to notice that about me immediately. It makes me feel so horrible that I'm not treated the same way as everyone else.\" </p> <p>The charity Age Concern admits it has no information about drug use among its client group. \"There are lots of specialist drugs groups out there and it's not something we get involved with,\" says a spokeswoman. But it is not alone. Bill Nelles, of the Methadone Alliance, a forum for those on methadone prescriptions, says it is regrettable that mainstream organisations do not address the issue. </p> <p>\"Older drug users encounter many problems on top of the ones that all older people have to deal with, and they need as much support as they can get,\" says Nelles. \"They find it difficult to access housing, particularly if they've just come out of rehab. It's very hard for drug users to get prescriptions for proper pain relief for conditions like arthritis and rheumatism. They tend to age more quickly than the rest of the population - in physical terms, they get older younger.\" </p> <p>Keith Dunn, a 60-year-old Londoner, says he wouldn't dream of going to an organisation for older people if he needed advice about benefits, housing or an issue connected with ageing. \"I get a lot of help from a specialist drugs service and whenever I have a problem, it is them I turn to to help me out, rather than social services or something like that,\" he says. </p> <p>Dunn began using heroin in the mid-60s and, like many of the relatively small group of users at that time, quickly graduated to prescription heroin from a private doctor. \"They used to give out so much heroin in those days, and they'd give you cocaine on prescription, too,\" he says. \"I knew all the addicts in London in those days; it was a very close-knit community. But the prescriptions were quite expensive. Some of those private doctors were no better than dealers, so I had to sell some of the drugs on to pay for them. You could sell 60mgs of heroin for a shilling.\" </p> <p>In 1967, Dunn moved to the US. When he returned in the early 70s, the days of abundant heroin and cocaine on prescription had ended and the policy of stabilising users on NHS methadone had taken over. Five years ago, he decided to stop injecting and is now stabilised on 150mgs of methadone a day. \"Some doctors think that's a very high dose, but it keeps me stable and comfortable,\" he says. </p> <p>Red Reece, aged 60, from London, has also stabilised his drug habit in recent years. He was introduced to heroin at the age of 23 in the mid-60s when he played drums with Georgie Fame's band. </p> <p>\"The saxophonist and his wife were both addicts and soon I was hooked too,\" he says. \"I remember going to a clinic in Camberwell Green and asking the doctor for some drugs. Without a word of protest he gave me 20 ampules of heroin and asked me if I'd like some cocaine too. I'm not advocating that doctors should do things like that now, but there was certainly a lot less crime in those days when people could get their drugs on prescription.\" </p> <p>Reece still injects heroin, but only once a week when his giro comes through. The rest of the week he takes a low maintenance dose of methadone. \"I don't want to take too much of the methadone because the more you use, the less you can feel the real stuff.\" </p> <p>In the mid-60s, there were just a few hundred registered addicts, some of whom are now in old age. In the first part of last year, according to Department of Health figures, agencies were approached for help by 31,800 drug users - most of them heroin users. </p> <p>The users getting old now are part of a first wave, but in decades to come the numbers of those who are also collecting their pensions will soar. </p> <p> <strong> Dutch take liberal approach </strong><br></p> <p> The Netherlands, which has a liberal attitude towards illicit drug use, acknowledges that older drug users do exist and that they have specific needs. To respond to those needs, two organisations - the Rotterdam Junky Union and the Bouman Foundation - have opened the world's first old people's home for drug users. </p> <p>The home, Hel Sophiahot, in Rotterdam, provides a tranquil bolthole from the hurly-burly of the street drug scene. It has seven places for older uses, and specialised care and supervision is provided. The project met initial opposition from local residents, but that has now subsided. </p> <p>Residents have their own bedrooms and bathrooms and are free to continue to use drugs - either methadone or street drugs. Carmen, a 53-year-old resident, says: \"The people here are quiet. We all want peace and quiet and to enjoy having our own place.\"</p>",

It's very hard for drug users to get prescriptions for proper pain relief for conditions like arthritis and rheumatism. They tend to age more quickly than the rest of the population - in physical terms, they get older younger.\" Keith Dunn, a 60-year-old Londoner, says he wouldn't dream of going to an organisation for older people if he needed advice about benefits, housing or an issue connected with ageing. \"I get a lot of help from a specialist drugs service and whenever I have a problem, it is them I turn to to help me out, rather than social services or something like that,\" he says. Dunn began using heroin in the mid-60s and, like many of the relatively small group of users at that time, quickly graduated to prescription heroin from a private doctor. \"They used to give out so much heroin in those days, and they'd give you cocaine on prescription, too,\" he says. \"I knew all the addicts in London in those days; it was a very close-knit community. But the prescriptions were quite expensive. Some of those private doctors were no better than dealers, so I had to sell some of the drugs on to pay for them. You could sell 60mgs of heroin for a shilling.\" In 1967, Dunn moved to the US. When he returned in the early 70s, the days of abundant heroin and cocaine on prescription had ended and the policy of stabilising users on NHS methadone had taken over. Five years ago, he decided to stop injecting and is now stabilised on 150mgs of methadone a day. \"Some doctors think that's a very high dose, but it keeps me stable and comfortable,\" he says. Red Reece, aged 60, from London, has also stabilised his drug habit in recent years. He was introduced to heroin at the age of 23 in the mid-60s when he played drums with Georgie Fame's band. \"The saxophonist and his wife were both addicts and soon I was hooked too,\" he says. \"I remember going to a clinic in Camberwell Green and asking the doctor for some drugs. Without a word of protest he gave me 20 ampules of heroin and asked me if I'd like some cocaine too. I'm not advocating that doctors should do things like that now, but there was certainly a lot less crime in those days when people could get their drugs on prescription.\" Reece still injects heroin, but only once a week when his giro comes through. The rest of the week he takes a low maintenance dose of methadone. \"I don't want to take too much of the methadone because the more you use, the less you can feel the real stuff.\" In the mid-60s, there were just a few hundred registered addicts, some of whom are now in old age. In the first part of last year, according to Department of Health figures, agencies were approached for help by 31,800 drug users - most of them heroin users. The users getting old now are part of a first wave, but in decades to come the numbers of those who are also collecting their pensions will soar. Dutch take liberal approach The Netherlands, which has a liberal attitude towards illicit drug use, acknowledges that older drug users do exist and that they have specific needs. To respond to those needs, two organisations - the Rotterdam Junky Union and the Bouman Foundation - have opened the world's first old people's home for drug users. The home, Hel Sophiahot, in Rotterdam, provides a tranquil bolthole from the hurly-burly of the street drug scene. It has seven places for older uses, and specialised care and supervision is provided. The project met initial opposition from local residents, but that has now subsided. Residents have their own bedrooms and bathrooms and are free to continue to use drugs - either methadone or street drugs. Carmen, a 53-year-old resident, says: \"The people here are quiet. We all want peace and quiet and to enjoy having our own place.\"",

      "body": "<p>Six million people visit a local chemist each day and yet, unlike GP services, this fundamental plank of primary care has received surprisingly little government attention. Now a new strategy for community pharmacy services promises radical reforms. But will they be too late to save many struggling businesses? </p> <p>The network of more than 10,000 pharmacies in England and Wales has been undergoing profound changes. While the total number of outlets has remained relatively stable, independent high street operators have been disappearing at what, to some, is an alarming rate. </p> <p>Over the past decade or so, the proportion of pharmacies owned by chains of more than five outlets has risen from 25% to more than 40%. In addition, new in-store supermarket pharmacies have developed quickly and now represent a significant market force. The days of the traditional, pharmacist-owned business may be numbered. One survey has estimated that more than 2,000 will disappear. </p> <p>The question for the government is whether this revolution in the market matters to patients. Hemant Patel, immediate past president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and himself the owner of an independent pharmacy, thinks it does. He suggests that the rise of the pharmacy multiples - large chains such as Boots -changes the relationship between patient and pharmacist. </p> <p>Independent pharmacists are \"familiar, well-known and with a trustworthy face\", Patel says. The informality of the setting means that \"things which are not mentioned to the doctor are often mentioned to the pharmacist because people do not want to bother the doctor\". </p> <p>The government may not share this view. Certainly, its recent actions have disadvantaged small pharmacies. The historic system of paying a higher dispensing fee for low volumes of prescriptions has been abandoned in favour of a flat fee. What is more, pharmacies with very low dispensing volumes do not even attract the \"professional allowance\" - a lump sum payment that is vital to the financial security of many small operators. The policy of successive governments appears to have been to encourage fewer, larger pharmacies in the hope that these will be more efficient and offer a greater range of services. </p> <p>Small operators face other pressures. The NHS reimburses pharmacies for the direct costs of the medicines dispensed on prescription. Reimbursement is reduced to reflect the discount it expects pharmacists to negotiate with wholesalers, but takes no account of whether a pharmacy is a stand-alone business or one of a chain. As a result, pharmacy multiples may achieve discounts greater than that clawed back by the government. Large chains that act as their own wholesalers - \"vertically integrated\", to use current jargon - can make further profits on top. </p> <p>For small, independent pharmacies, the future looks bleak. The age profile of proprietors is getting older as few young pharmacists want to invest in the current environment and older ones are unable to leave, locked in by long shop leases. </p> <p>Whether this enforced stability can continue is another question. Many aspects of the business, such as the dispensing of specialist, high-cost drugs, are simply unprofitable. Patel's experience is typical. \"Pharmacists get punished every time they dispense high-cost items,\" he says. \"For most high-cost items, the borrowing costs are greater than the 94p I get back in fees.\" And despite the government's drive to get large companies to pay small businesses quickly, pharmacists do not receive full payment from the NHS for 90 days. </p> <p>Meanwhile, all pharmacies, big and small, face competition from supermarkets in the health and beauty market. According to a survey by retail analyst Verdict Research, grocers and supermarkets now have a greater share of the market for toiletries, cosmetics and over-the-counter medicines than the health and beauty specialists. The recent collapse of the office of fair trading's legal challenge to resale price maintenance on medicines may have done no more than buy some time for smaller operators. According to the Community Pharmacy Action Group, representing pharmacy owners, as many as one in four businesses could go under if price-fixing on proprietary medicines is abolished. </p> <p>Will the new pharmacy strategy make much difference? There are at least some hopeful signs that it will. The strategy envisages greater availability of drugs without prescription, introduction of electronic prescribing and a new role for pharmacists to help patients manage complex medicine regimes - and even to prescribe medicines themselves. To implement these changes, ministers want an overhaul of the contracting arrangements through which pharmacists provide NHS services. </p> <p>These new arrangements are likely to pay pharmacists more for quality and breadth of service, rather than simply the number of prescriptions dispensed. This should help the small pharmacist prepared to develop new skills, and substantial funding has been earmarked for national pilots. More important, it should be good for patients, who will have better access to health professionals skilled in the management of medicines. </p> <p>Yet, at the same time, the government has announced that many of the 500 new primary care centres promised in the NHS plan will incorporate pharmacy services. In addition, ministers are prepared to break down barriers that currently restrict establishment of new pharmacies. Both these measures may increase local competition for pharmacy services and push the small independent over the edge. </p> <p>Many industries go through fundamental restructuring. Why not let the market take its course? A key policy objective of the government, and the Department of Health, is better access to health services - particularly for the disadvantaged. The worst-case scenario would be an uncontrolled contraction of community pharmacies, with disastrous consequences for patients. Even the large multiples are not immune; Boots is closing dozens of smaller, high street branches in favour of new out-of-town sites. </p> <p>Loss of local pharmacies would particularly hit elderly people and those without cars. And the \"chemist shop\" may often be the linchpin in already vulnerable local high street parades. A government concerned with the protection of local communities, and addressing social exclusion, will surely want to consider this very carefully. </p> <p>\u0095 Richard Lewis is a visiting fellow at the King's Fund health policy institute.</p> <p> <strong> Mixture of care and community</strong><br></p> <p>Mary O'Hara<br></p> <p>You can almost touch the walls if you stretch your arms out in the cramped dispensary at the back of Marshall Gellman's pharmacy, which sits inconspicuously between a grocer's and a butcher's in a parade of shops. </p> <p>Gellman has been dispensing prescriptions to the people of Moston, Manchester, for 45 years.

And when the mother regains consciousness, she stumbles to a phone and bawls abuse at the social workers. </p> <p>This was not an unusual scene during the first 39 years of the life of Helen Massey-Roche, a self-confessed drug and alcohol addict ever since she was 12, when she washed down her mother's Valium with cider. For almost three decades, Massey-Roche's lifestyle revolved around heroin, prescribed drugs and alcohol. </p> <p>During her chaotic, rootless life, she witnessed her closest friends die from overdoses; she seriously injured her mother after she refused to hand over money for drugs; she was strait-jacketed in psychiatric hospital and, on seven occasions, her children were placed on emergency protection orders. In fact, her life almost once came to an undignified end when, after a street brawl, she ended up in intensive care with a brain haemorrhage. With her daughter at her bedside, a priest performed last rites. </p> <p>But Massey-Roche survived. And her life, far from being one of hopelessness, has become one of immense fortitude. </p> <p>It all changed one January afternoon in 1990, when she awoke from another 10-day alcohol binge to find her children had again been taken into care and social services would not tell her where they were. \"I looked at a half-drunk bottle of Jameson's and thought how bad and evil I was,\" she remembers. </p> <p>\"I could hear the voice of my mother saying: 'You are a bad one.' But it came to me that if I didn't drink what was in the bottle, none of this would happen. It was a moment of clarity and I don't know why it happened then. It was like a kind of conversion - but not a religious one.\" </p> <p>From then, every night for two years, Massey-Roche attended a self-help group for alcoholics. With support, she weathered withdrawal symptoms and eventually came off all drugs and alcohol. Then she rebuilt herself. First, O-levels; then an access course in youth and community work; then a social work degree. </p> <p>It has been a remarkable, but agonising journey. \"I had two years of terrible shame and guilt for what I had done to my children and parents,\" she says. \"I walked between wanting to kill myself and wanting to do my best.\" </p> <p>Massey-Roche's determination, aided by unwavering support from professionals, culminated not only in her winning back custody of her children in 1994, but three years later becoming founding director of the Stockport-based Alcohol and Drug Abstinence Service (Adas), which offers six-week therapeutic programmes to dependants. </p> <p>In so doing, Massey-Roche has shed her old identity as a self-loathing addict to become, now at 49, a smartly-dressed professional employing more than 15 therapists and responsible for an annual budget of \u00a3280,000. </p> <p>\"I used to see everyone - social workers, doctors and probation workers - as my enemy,\" she recalls. \"There were many days when I used to shout at social workers to get out of my house. But now I recognise how their intervention was right and how the needs and welfare of my children were paramount. And I was always treated with respect.\" </p> <p>It took four years of case conferences for Massey-Roche to win back her children, who at one point were almost put up for adoption. And, despite her past, she found that professionals \"rallied around\" on witnessing the fundamental change of character in their client. </p> <p>Her experience makes her a valuable - and rare - breed of social work professional: someone who sees a mirror of herself in each drug and alcohol user who comes through Adas's door.

      "body": "<p>This is the problem: over the past 40 years, per capita world food production has grown by 25%, and food prices in real terms have fallen by 40%. Yet the world still faces a fundamental challenge. Despite steadily falling fertility rates and family sizes, the global population is expected to grow to 8.9bn by 2050, from 6bn today. By then, 84% of people will be in what we call the \"developing\" world. </p> <p>Last year, 790m people went hungry and, even though increased production and more imports will lessen the problem in future, food insecurity and malnutrition will undoubtedly persist. Food demand, moreover, is expected to grow. </p> <p>The conventional wisdom is that to double food supply, we need to redouble efforts to modernise agriculture. After all, it has been successful in the past. But there are real doubts about the capacity of such systems to reduce food poverty. The poor and hungry need low-cost, readily available technologies and practices to increase local food production. </p> <p>There are three possible choices for future agriculture: expand the area of farmland by converting new lands, but with the result that forests, grasslands and other areas of important biodiversity are lost; intensify production in agricultural exporting countries, so that food can be sold to those who need it; or increase total farm productivity in the countries which most need the food. </p> <p>The success of modern agriculture in recent decades has often masked significant \"externalities\", affecting both natural capital and human health, as well as agriculture itself. Environmental and health problems associated with agriculture have been well-documented, but it is only recently that the scale of the costs has come to be appreciated. </p> <p>With the help of funding from the Department for International Development, Bread for the World and Greenpeace, the University of Essex's centre for environment and society set out to see if farmers can improve food production with cheap, low-cost, locally-available technologies and inputs, and whether they can do this without causing further environmental damage. </p> <p>The model, which is increasingly being used in developing countries from Cuba to India and from Malawi to Peru, is \"sustainable agriculture\". This seeks to make the best use of nature's goods and services by integrating natural and regenerative processes, like nutrient cycling, nitrogen fixation and soil regeneration. </p> <p>It minimises the use of pesticides and fertilizers that damage the environment or harm the health of farmers and consumers, makes better use of the knowledge and skills of farmers, so improving their self-reliance and seeks to make productive use of \"social capital\" - people's capacities to work together to solve common problems, such as pests, watershed, irrigation, forest and credit management. It also contributes to a range of public goods, such as clean water, wildlife, carbon sequestration in soils, flood protection and landscape quality. </p> <p>But could it feed the world in the coming decades? We tried to audit, via the Safe-World research project, recent worldwide progress towards sustainable agriculture and assess the extent to which these projects, if spread on a much larger scale, could feed a growing world population. </p> <p>Our database now contains information on 208 projects from 52 countries. This is the largest known survey of worldwide sustainable agriculture. Some 8.98m farmers have now adopted sustainable agriculture practices and technologies on 28.92m hectares.

It shows the extraordinary productive potential of small patches on farms, and the degree to which they can improve domestic food security. </p> <p>Splitting the data into small farmers growing cereals or roots, and larger farmers, we found that for 4.42m small farmers practising sustainable agriculture on 3.58m hectares, average food production per household increased by 1.71 tonnes per year (up 73%). For the 146,000 farmers on 542,000 hectares cultivating roots (potato, sweet potato and cassava), the increase in food production was 17 tonnes per year (an increase of 150%); and for the larger farms in Latin America (average size about 90 hectares), total production increased by 150 tonnes per household (an increase of 46%). </p> <p>Few projects, however, reported surpluses of food being sold to local markets.

      "bodyText": "This is the problem: over the past 40 years, per capita world food production has grown by 25%, and food prices in real terms have fallen by 40%. Yet the world still faces a fundamental challenge. Despite steadily falling fertility rates and family sizes, the global population is expected to grow to 8.9bn by 2050, from 6bn today. By then, 84% of people will be in what we call the \"developing\" world. Last year, 790m people went hungry and, even though increased production and more imports will lessen the problem in future, food insecurity and malnutrition will undoubtedly persist. Food demand, moreover, is expected to grow. The conventional wisdom is that to double food supply, we need to redouble efforts to modernise agriculture. After all, it has been successful in the past. But there are real doubts about the capacity of such systems to reduce food poverty. The poor and hungry need low-cost, readily available technologies and practices to increase local food production. There are three possible choices for future agriculture: expand the area of farmland by converting new lands, but with the result that forests, grasslands and other areas of important biodiversity are lost; intensify production in agricultural exporting countries, so that food can be sold to those who need it; or increase total farm productivity in the countries which most need the food. The success of modern agriculture in recent decades has often masked significant \"externalities\", affecting both natural capital and human health, as well as agriculture itself. Environmental and health problems associated with agriculture have been well-documented, but it is only recently that the scale of the costs has come to be appreciated. With the help of funding from the Department for International Development, Bread for the World and Greenpeace, the University of Essex's centre for environment and society set out to see if farmers can improve food production with cheap, low-cost, locally-available technologies and inputs, and whether they can do this without causing further environmental damage. The model, which is increasingly being used in developing countries from Cuba to India and from Malawi to Peru, is \"sustainable agriculture\". This seeks to make the best use of nature's goods and services by integrating natural and regenerative processes, like nutrient cycling, nitrogen fixation and soil regeneration. It minimises the use of pesticides and fertilizers that damage the environment or harm the health of farmers and consumers, makes better use of the knowledge and skills of farmers, so improving their self-reliance and seeks to make productive use of \"social capital\" - people's capacities to work together to solve common problems, such as pests, watershed, irrigation, forest and credit management. It also contributes to a range of public goods, such as clean water, wildlife, carbon sequestration in soils, flood protection and landscape quality. But could it feed the world in the coming decades? We tried to audit, via the Safe-World research project, recent worldwide progress towards sustainable agriculture and assess the extent to which these projects, if spread on a much larger scale, could feed a growing world population. Our database now contains information on 208 projects from 52 countries. This is the largest known survey of worldwide sustainable agriculture. Some 8.98m farmers have now adopted sustainable agriculture practices and technologies on 28.92m hectares. There are 960m hectares of arable and permanent crops in Africa, Asia and Latin America, so sustainable agriculture is present on at least 3% of this land. We found that sustainable agriculture can lead to substantial increases in food production per hectare.

The senators, acting as judges, voted 11 to 10 not to open crucial bank records allegedly showing the amount of wealth amassed by Mr Estrada in office. The prosecution denounced their decision as a \"shameless vote of acquittal\". It was a stunning victory for the president, and prompted some of senators who voted to unseal the documents to storm out of court and others to burst into tears. The prosecutors announced that they were resigning en masse in protest. In a statement Mr Estrada called on the country to shun violence and added: \"Just like in any important trial ... you win some, you lose some.\" The head of the Roman Catholic church in the Philippines, Cardinal Jaime Sin, told about 10,000 demonstrators in an unusual midnight protest that he feared the senate vote would spark violence. \"I am so afraid that ... we might not be able to stop bloodshed. \"We know in our hearts that the president is guilty,\" he said as protesters chanted \"Erap resign\", using Mr Estrada's nickname. Cardinal Sin said he cried when the senate voted, and warned there would be prolonged protests. The protesters sought to recreate a \"people power\" revolt on the site beside a Manila road where in 1986 hundreds of thousands of Filipinos joined rebel soldiers in a four-day uprising which toppled the dictator Ferdinand Marcos. The vice-president, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, and former president Corazon Aquino joined Cardinal Sin at the protest. In another part of Manila about 1,000 residents carrying signs reading \"Erap resign\" poured on to the streets banging pots and cans in a barrage of noise. An effigy of Mr Estrada was burned. Dozens of nuns joined the protest. About 400 people held a rally in a smart suburb and picketed the house of the finance secretary, Jose Pardo, urging him to resign. Smaller protests erupted in the cities of Davao, Bacolod and Iloilo, radio reports said. ANC Television said troops tightened security around the headquarters of the armed forces and the national police. Before the vote, the prosecutors appealed to the court to unseal bank documents which they said would show that the former movie actor had amassed 3.3bn pesos (\u00a343m) in just one and a half years in office. The defence vigorously opposed the opening of the records, saying that it was immaterial to the case and would violate the constitution. Mr Estrada will be removed from office if convicted on any one of the four charges against him - corruption, bribery, betrayal of public trust and culpable violation of the constitution. The trial was brought about by accusations that Mr Estrada had taken bribes from illegal gambling and pocketed tobacco taxes. Reuters",

The Underground's new safety procedures for the government's planned break-up of the tube do \"not provide us with confidence that there is a safety management process in place to reduce the risks\", a senior health and safety inspector has warned managers in a leaked letter. Hazards and risks \"do not appear to have been considered\", principal inspector Peter Hornsby wrote to LU's managing director on January 12. He voiced fears over \"driving, signal operation, track maintenance, assault, vandalism and trespass\", adding: \"It is not clear who does what, how and when.\" But while refusing to give a health and safety go-ahead to the part-privatisation scheme - less than two weeks before long-term contracts with private consortiums are supposed to be signed - Mr Hornsby has waived the usual requirement for entirely new safety plans to be submitted because of shortage of time. The leak of the latest safety failure will be a further em barrassment to Mr Prescott, whose officials have resumed contact with Ken Livingstone's transport commissioner Robert Kiley in an attempt to end the stand-off over the tube between the government and the London mayor. It follows earlier warnings by safety inspectors of \"potentially serious consequences\" in the scheme and a report by the national audit office saying the case for part-privatisation was \"clearly not proved\". The two main rail unions are balloting tube workers for a strike over what they regard as inadequate safety protection under Mr Prescott's plans, which would see track, stations and signalling handed over to private companies on 30-year contracts. Government sources said last month that the prime minister had instructed Mr Prescott to find a compromise over the tube.

      "body": "<p>Fragments of depleted uranium ammunition found in Kosovo were made with reprocessed fuel from nuclear reactors, the United Nations confirmed yesterday, raising new fears about the risks of contamination.</p> <p>Officials of the UN environment programme said tests on material gathered by its team of experts in Kosovo had revealed traces of uranium 236 - an isotope found only in spent nuclear fuel - among weapons delivered by Nato aircraft in the 1999 conflict.</p> <p>The discovery came as the latest senior figure to enter the debate, the commander of British forces in the Gulf war, Sir Peter de la Billiere, called last night for a full public inquiry into claims that exposure to depleted uranium weapons had caused serious illnesses among British troops. He also suggested compensation for afflicted service personnel.</p> <p>The latest DU discovery, which follows the investigation of eight of the 112 sites in Kosovo by a team of UN scientists last November, is likely to prompt questions about what other dangerous radioactive materials may have been contained in the US shells.</p> <p>Futher analysis is being carried out in five European laboratories to determine radioactivity levels. The World Health Organisation and other international bodies have also been asked to give their as sessment of the implications of the finding.</p> <p>There are two types of depleted uranium, known as \"clean and dirty\". Until now it has been assumed that the material used in US shells was of the clean variety which is obtained as a side-product of the extraction of uranium 235 from ore to make nuclear fuel or nuclear weapons.</p> <p>By contrast \"dirty\" DU is what is left over when the fuel has been through a nuclear reaction. It is known as \"dirty\" because it may be contaminated with traces of far more dangerous isotopes such as plutonium and other highly radioactive particles.</p> <p>\"This is the first time that the spent fuel origins of DU munitions have emerged,\" David Kyd, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is taking part in the UN's investigation, said last night.</p> <p>The UN environment programme said in a statement last night that the amount of uranium 236 had been so small that it had minimal extra radioactive toxicity.</p> <p>However, it said a final assessment would only be made once testing on spent ammunition, soil, water and milk samples collected in Kosovo is completed next month.</p> <p>When British Nuclear Fuels supplied shells to the MoD for use in the Gulf war, it used clean DU. But in 1993, according to documents seen by the Guardian, 120,000kg of DU were imported from the US for use in munitions.</p> <p>None of this was used by British forces in Kosovo although tanks with this ammunition on board were ready for deployment. Last night it was not known whether the DU imported into Britain was clean or dirty.</p> <p>The likely explanation of how dirty DU came to be used in Kosovo is one of cost and ease of access by the US military. In the privatised world of US nuclear utilities the clean DU would belong to private companies.</p> <p>In the possession of the government would be stockpiles of dirty DU left over from the cold war when the US military reprocessed thousands of tonnes of spent nuclear fuel to extract the plutonium.

      "bodyText": "Fragments of depleted uranium ammunition found in Kosovo were made with reprocessed fuel from nuclear reactors, the United Nations confirmed yesterday, raising new fears about the risks of contamination. Officials of the UN environment programme said tests on material gathered by its team of experts in Kosovo had revealed traces of uranium 236 - an isotope found only in spent nuclear fuel - among weapons delivered by Nato aircraft in the 1999 conflict. The discovery came as the latest senior figure to enter the debate, the commander of British forces in the Gulf war, Sir Peter de la Billiere, called last night for a full public inquiry into claims that exposure to depleted uranium weapons had caused serious illnesses among British troops. He also suggested compensation for afflicted service personnel. The latest DU discovery, which follows the investigation of eight of the 112 sites in Kosovo by a team of UN scientists last November, is likely to prompt questions about what other dangerous radioactive materials may have been contained in the US shells. Futher analysis is being carried out in five European laboratories to determine radioactivity levels. The World Health Organisation and other international bodies have also been asked to give their as sessment of the implications of the finding. There are two types of depleted uranium, known as \"clean and dirty\". Until now it has been assumed that the material used in US shells was of the clean variety which is obtained as a side-product of the extraction of uranium 235 from ore to make nuclear fuel or nuclear weapons. By contrast \"dirty\" DU is what is left over when the fuel has been through a nuclear reaction. It is known as \"dirty\" because it may be contaminated with traces of far more dangerous isotopes such as plutonium and other highly radioactive particles. \"This is the first time that the spent fuel origins of DU munitions have emerged,\" David Kyd, a spokesman for the International Atomic Energy Agency, which is taking part in the UN's investigation, said last night. The UN environment programme said in a statement last night that the amount of uranium 236 had been so small that it had minimal extra radioactive toxicity. However, it said a final assessment would only be made once testing on spent ammunition, soil, water and milk samples collected in Kosovo is completed next month. When British Nuclear Fuels supplied shells to the MoD for use in the Gulf war, it used clean DU. But in 1993, according to documents seen by the Guardian, 120,000kg of DU were imported from the US for use in munitions. None of this was used by British forces in Kosovo although tanks with this ammunition on board were ready for deployment. Last night it was not known whether the DU imported into Britain was clean or dirty. The likely explanation of how dirty DU came to be used in Kosovo is one of cost and ease of access by the US military. In the privatised world of US nuclear utilities the clean DU would belong to private companies. In the possession of the government would be stockpiles of dirty DU left over from the cold war when the US military reprocessed thousands of tonnes of spent nuclear fuel to extract the plutonium. For every tonne of plutonium gained, 100 tonnes of dirty DU would have to be stored. In the 1980s and 1990s all four big nuclear powers - Russia, US, UK and France - began converting stockpiles of otherwise useless DU into armour piercing weapons. It was not until last night that anyone outside military circles realised that some of it was dirty DU. Meanwhile, it emerged that General Sir Peter de la Billiere confirmed he was not warned that DU weapons could pose a radiation danger. Sir Peter's intervention will be welcomed by Gulf war vet erans convinced the shells have led to serious illnesses. Asked by the BBC News if he supported calls for a full public inquiry into DU weapons, Sir Peter replied: \"Of course, for two reasons. If indeed there is a proven link to illnesses (veterans have) got to be looked after and receive proper compensation.\" Secondly, he said, it was critically important to establish whether there was a link because if there was not, the military would want to go on us ing the weapons. Asked if he was warned about DU weapons - fired by British tanks as well as American armour and aircraft during the Gulf war - Sir Peter said: \"I was not aware there were any specific dangers to it.\" He added that British commanders wanted to make sure they had the \"best equipment on the market\".",

      "bodyText": "An inquiry is under way in Nigeria into allegations that the multinational pharmaceuticals company Pfizer used an experimental drug on sick children during a major outbreak of meningitis, without official approval. Yesterday the Nigerian doctor employed by Pfizer to run the clinical trial in Kano said that the letter certifying approval by the ethics committee at the hospital where the children were treated was probably written a year after the experiment took place. Pfizer admitted last night that there did \"appear to be possible documentary irregularities\" and said they were co-operating fully with the inquiry. Pfizer sent a team in to Kano at very short notice in 1996, when it heard of the outbreak of spinal meningitis. The company wanted to test the efficacy of its new drug Trovan on children, and such outbreaks in the west are now relatively rare. About 15,000 people died in the epidemic, and children from a wide area were brought to Kano because of its infectious diseases hospital, staffed by volunteer doctors from M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res. Pfizer set up a temporary clinic nearby and treated 200 children, half of whom were given the new drug, a pill, and half the \"gold standard\" drug, cephtriaxone, given by injection. Five of the children given Trovan died, together with six who were on the standard treatment. But the Washington Post, which has been investigating the drug trial, has alleged that at least one child was not taken off the experimental drug and given the tried and tested treatment when it was clear that her condition was not improving, flouting the ethical rules of clinical trials. Yesterday further questions were asked about the ethics of the trial as the doctor working for Pfizer in Kano, Abdulhamid Isa Dutse, admitted to the Post that it was \"possible\" that the letter certifying that the trial was authorised was written as much as a year after Pfizer's team had left. Doubts about the letter, which was taken as proof to the US food and drug administration that the trial had been ethically carried out, was intensified by statements from two other Nigerian doctors. Sadiq S Wali, the hospital's medical director, told the Post that the document was \"a lie\". He said the hospital had no ethics committee at the time of Pfizer's trial It only organised one, and created the letterhead stationery that was used on the letter, months later. Dr Idris Mohammed said he had challenged the correctness of the Pfizer project at the time. \"There was no ethical committee at the time of the trial, none met, and no approval was properly given for the trial,\" he said. The latest revelations are hugely embarrassing to Pfizer, which insists there was a philanthropic element to the trial. MSF was using the only drug that was available in Nigeria -one that had not been allowed in the west for 50 years because of the side effects- said Pfizer's spokeswoman, Kate Robins, whereas Pfizer introduced not only its experimental drug, for which it already had safety data from more than 5,000 patients, but also the \"gold standard\" drug used in the west, cephtriaxone. \"This was not in any way a cavalier effort,\" she said. Asked why, in that case, Pfizer had treated only 200 children when the epidemic killed 15,000, she added: \"This is the first time we'd done that in epidemic meningitis. Science governs our decisions.\" The experimental drug used, Trovan, has since been licensed, but not for children. However, it is not marketed in Nigeria. Like all new drugs, which have a 20-year patent protection, the cost is too high for developing countries.",

Later this year, in a gala in his home town of Modena, he will mark a 40-year career in the opera house. Yet the great tenor shows little sign of preparing to give up. </p> <p>It is not clear what Pavarotti hopes to prove by returning to the stage, as he has done in Aida in New York this week. By no stretch of the most generous imagination can he still be said to have dramatic presence. Presumably, he is to some extent singing for the taxman and his ex-wife as well as his ever-loving public. Yet Pavarotti can earn much more by doing far less than he is doing at the Metropolitan Opera for the next few weeks. At some level he must still crave the opportunity to prove himself on stage as an artist. </p> <p>If one was being uncritically indulgent towards Pavarotti, one could say that Radames is a suitably static part for the virtually immobile tenor. Verdi's Aida is full of big set pieces; it is all about spectacle, and does not require much in the way of movement. Even so, Pavarotti rarely moves from his preferred position at centre stage right, whatever the dramatic circumstances. His repertoire of gestures is virtually non-existent. He wipes his brow obsessively. He often needs to sit down, and thus must be provided with an improbable stage rock on which to rest, even when the score is burning with energy and passion. It is the sort of performance that renders opera unbelievable and gives the art form a bad name. </p> <p>If it were not for the voice, that is. It is not what it was, of course, any more than the knees are. Allowances must be, and are, made. Pavarotti has to nurse himself through exposed phrases and, on occasions, resorts to rushing a passage that would otherwise be too dangerous. Inevitably, there are slapdash moments, and the vocal characterisation is increasingly generalised. Inevitably too, that big, incisive, emotional lyric sound that so amazed the operatic and non-operatic worlds alike in the 1970s and 1980s as no Italian voice had done since Gigli does not have the amplitude of its most glorious days. Yet Pavarotti is still able to show why he was the vocal phenomenon of the postwar epoch. </p> <p>The phrases may not make the great paragraphs of ringing sound the way they used to, but many moments are still focused, brilliant and thrilling. As often with veteran singers, one notices the artful way of dealing with difficulty, and one is generous because there is much else still to admire. If anyone goes to this Aida solely to mock, they will come away with surprised respect for what Pavarotti can still accomplish. </p> <p>Radames has a famously killer start to the opera, pitching straight into his most famous aria, Celeste Aida, with only a couple of lines to warm up. Pavarotti took the test carefully, with due respect for the challenges, and lunged for the finish in a way Verdi never intended. But once over that fence, he rarely looked back. In the Nile and tomb scenes he sang with much more freedom. Just occasionally, the years rolled away. </p> <p>In opera, Pavarotti has always been a generous singer. He is not one of those tenors who save themselves for the glory moments and barely bother with the rest of it. His exemplary recitatives and his unflagging contribution to ensemble have always been among the glories of his operatic singing. And they still are. Again and again, without necessarily intending to, one notices the incisiveness of Pavarotti, even in small contributions. </p> <p>As it often does, the Met had surrounded its venerable star with a formidable company of principals. Not many tenors today could keep pace with the lustrous Olga Borodina as Amneris, one of the truly great singers of the moment, and Pavarotti was clearly put on his mettle. He also visibly responded to Deborah Voigt - who is almost as big as he is - as Aida. Voigt grew more ambitious, more relaxed and thus less vocally conventional as the evening went on. James Levine conducted with real rhythmic bite. </p> <p>Should Pavarotti still be doing this at 65? Well, if he is game and audiences want to pay very large sums to hear a legend, who is to say no? But there has to come a time to call it a day, and he is surely very close to it. If this proves to be Pavarotti's operatic stage swansong, he will have gone out proving he can still do some things of which most others can only dream.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I first met Alison Steadman not when I was sent to interview her, but when she arrived to interview me. She needed to know how women journalists behaved for a film she was making. Were we all teeth and shoulderpads (this was the early 1990s)? And did we really rummage through celebrity dustbins? </p> <p>I don't know what I said to her, but it clearly didn't ring true because, a week later, she was back, more anxious this time. She'd found out she was going to have to interview Edwina Currie. For real, on camera. The catch was that she would be in character but Edwina wouldn't. \"Don't worry,\" I told her (or, at least, she says I told her). \"You've done far more research than I ever would.\" </p> <p>I was not the only journalist she interviewed on the way to creating Jackie Johns, bitch columnist, for Les Blair's television film News Hounds. We've all assured ourselves that Jackie Johns was not actually based on us - and yet we all know that Steadman's great strength as an actress is her uncanny nose for the bits of ordinary people that are vulnerable to satirical assault. </p> <p>Look at Beverley from Abigail's Party (model: a Selfridges make-up lady Steadman once saw demolish a plain little shopper who had the misfortune to get sucked into a demonstration). Look at Jane Horrocks's mother in The Rise and Fall of Little Voice (model: a middle-aged battle-axe she met on a cast outing to a Bolton nightclub). Both characters were created through precisely the sort of exhaustive homework that she was doing for News Hounds. </p> <p>What makes it odder is that Steadman does not appear to be a particularly sharp or satirical person. She seems a down-to-earth, straight-to-the-chin sort who talks warmly of her family and honestly of her professional ups and downs. Once again she has been reduced to a state of nervous excitement - only this time it's by the prospect of returning Joe Orton's first play, Entertaining Mr Sloane, to the West End theatre in which it was premiered in 1964. </p> <p>In this immaculately unpleasant comedy she plays Kath, a manipulative widow who pursues a bisexual psychopath. So is Kath modelled on some unfortunate interviewee? Improvisation, she says, is very different from appearing in a scripted play. While one involves creation, the other involves interpretation. \"Kath is a real mix of childlike, vulnerable and manipulative: she's the mother, the seductress. She's so unsubtle but, in other ways, she knows exactly what she's doing. Of course, you have to understand the feelings in the play to an extent, otherwise you couldn't do it. There are times on stage playing Kath when I feel this terrible emotional well. A bit of that is Alison feeling very sorry for her and channelling that pity into her.\" </p> <p>It's at this point that the distinction between improvisation and scripted plays breaks down. \"The older you get, the more things you feel and the more you can remember,\" she says. To that extent, acting gets easier with age. \"Like having a baby put into your arms. Before I'd had a baby I'd played a woman giving birth and I had a crack at it, but when I had my own baby I realised I'd been terrible.

It's an empathetic intelligence, an actor's intelligence, which Steadman has in abundance. Sometimes it surfaces in merciless flights of mimicry; sometimes it sends a shiver of recognition through you. </p> <p>By her own admission, Steadman, 54, wasn't a high-flyer at school. \"Basically, I would impersonate anyone as a child.

She got in. There she found people who were happy to stay up into the early hours discussing Chekhov. She also met Mike Leigh, an up-and-coming director who was drafted in to direct a student show. She wasn't in the show, but they met again when she was back in Liverpool working at the Everyman Theatre. He offered her a part in a BBC Play for Today and a relationship formed that was to lead to more than 20 years of marriage, two sons and some of the definitive theatre and film work of the 20th century, from Abigail's Party and Nuts in May to Life is Sweet. </p> <p>Although she and Leigh split up five years ago, they have worked together since, on his film Topsy-Turvy, and she sees no reason why they shouldn't do so again. \"We got on extremely well before when we worked together.

      "bodyText": "I first met Alison Steadman not when I was sent to interview her, but when she arrived to interview me. She needed to know how women journalists behaved for a film she was making. Were we all teeth and shoulderpads (this was the early 1990s)? And did we really rummage through celebrity dustbins? I don't know what I said to her, but it clearly didn't ring true because, a week later, she was back, more anxious this time. She'd found out she was going to have to interview Edwina Currie. For real, on camera. The catch was that she would be in character but Edwina wouldn't. \"Don't worry,\" I told her (or, at least, she says I told her). \"You've done far more research than I ever would.\" I was not the only journalist she interviewed on the way to creating Jackie Johns, bitch columnist, for Les Blair's television film News Hounds. We've all assured ourselves that Jackie Johns was not actually based on us - and yet we all know that Steadman's great strength as an actress is her uncanny nose for the bits of ordinary people that are vulnerable to satirical assault. Look at Beverley from Abigail's Party (model: a Selfridges make-up lady Steadman once saw demolish a plain little shopper who had the misfortune to get sucked into a demonstration). Look at Jane Horrocks's mother in The Rise and Fall of Little Voice (model: a middle-aged battle-axe she met on a cast outing to a Bolton nightclub). Both characters were created through precisely the sort of exhaustive homework that she was doing for News Hounds. What makes it odder is that Steadman does not appear to be a particularly sharp or satirical person. She seems a down-to-earth, straight-to-the-chin sort who talks warmly of her family and honestly of her professional ups and downs. Once again she has been reduced to a state of nervous excitement - only this time it's by the prospect of returning Joe Orton's first play, Entertaining Mr Sloane, to the West End theatre in which it was premiered in 1964. In this immaculately unpleasant comedy she plays Kath, a manipulative widow who pursues a bisexual psychopath. So is Kath modelled on some unfortunate interviewee? Improvisation, she says, is very different from appearing in a scripted play. While one involves creation, the other involves interpretation. \"Kath is a real mix of childlike, vulnerable and manipulative: she's the mother, the seductress. She's so unsubtle but, in other ways, she knows exactly what she's doing. Of course, you have to understand the feelings in the play to an extent, otherwise you couldn't do it. There are times on stage playing Kath when I feel this terrible emotional well. A bit of that is Alison feeling very sorry for her and channelling that pity into her.\" It's at this point that the distinction between improvisation and scripted plays breaks down. \"The older you get, the more things you feel and the more you can remember,\" she says. To that extent, acting gets easier with age. \"Like having a baby put into your arms. Before I'd had a baby I'd played a woman giving birth and I had a crack at it, but when I had my own baby I realised I'd been terrible. I'd done my research, of course, but no one really tells you what it's like.\" The ability to store these memories at a subconscious level and pull them out when the occasion demands takes a particular kind of intelligence.

He is flying in from Berlin late this afternoon, Steinway is sending over a piano suitable for the programme - likely to include Schubert and Chopin - and he will perform for a select gathering of musical and media luminaries. But why? </p> <p>The answer can be summed up in two words - love and friendship. Friendship for the documentary film-maker Christopher Nupen, who has ploughed around \u00a350,000 of his own money into making the film that this evening's event will publicise. And love for the subject of that film, Barenboim's former wife, the great cellist Jacqueline Du Pr\u00e9. </p> <p>Nupen's film, which will be shown on Channel 5 next month, is called Who Was Jacqueline du Pr\u00e9? It has been seen as a counter by Du Pr\u00e9's friends to the 1998 film Hilary and Jackie - based on the book A Genius in the Family by Jacqueline's siblings, Hilary and Piers - which suggested that she could be manipulative, self-centred and sexually predatory. But Nupen himself, who has refused even to see Hilary and Jackie, is adamant that the film is not a direct response. </p> <p>\"I've never made a film against anything,\" he says. \"Films against things are not my medium; they're not what I'm good at. What I want to do is remember the person as she was. It is possible to conceive of a film that continues this polemic. That's not what I wanted to do, and I don't think it's what's going to matter in 25 or 50 years from now.\" </p> <p>No one, however, seems to have communicated Nupen's reservations about putting the two films together in the ring to those responsible for publicity for his film. \"The world has an irresistible need to embellish its myths, and it is a sad fact that ever since illness touched her, at the age of 28, the public image of her personality has been progressively distorted, particularly by the fiction film Hilary and Jackie,\" said one early press release. \"Everyone who knew Jackie has been appalled by the distorted image this presented. And so Nupen's film was born.\" </p> <p>That, not surprisingly, led to a spate of stories that presented the film as a direct riposte - by Nupen, Barenboim and close friends such as Itzhak Perlman and Pinchas Zukerman - to Hilary and Jackie, which had dared to portray a darker side to the artist and focused on her adultery with Hilary's husband, Kiffer Finzi. No matter how much he protests, it will now be difficult for Nupen to wrench the film from that context. </p> <p>Nupen wants his film to be a celebration of Du Pr\u00e9's life and musical genius. He has a touching faith in the power of the pictures of her rehearsing in the 1960s to obliterate the darker message of Hilary and Jackie. But is his position really tenable? </p> <p>\"She retains her hold on the public imagination,\" he insists. \"People want to know more about her, and when they encounter her again on the screen they are bowled over by her. She brings you to life. You can't describe that, but you can film it. I've heard people in record shops say, 'I don't want a recording by that strange woman' or that 'awful woman'. Well, she wasn't an awful woman; she was quite the opposite of that.\" </p> <p>Those misconceptions, I suggest to him, must have come from the movie Hilary and Jackie, and to tackle them he should surely have made a point of seeing it. \"Every person who has ever spoken to me about it tells me things that do not ring true to the person I knew,\" he says. \"I'm not a masochist, I don't want to be upset, I don't want to be angry, so I decided not to see it. A lot of people said to me, 'You can't make a film about Jackie if you don't see it.' I wrestled with that for some time, but I've made 72 films and none of them was made against something that somebody had said.\" </p> <p>Nupen, who is 66, came to prominence in the 1960s with a series of films about Du Pr\u00e9, Barenboim and the other young talents gathered around that glittering couple. He had studied classical guitar under Segovia, was a close friend of guitarist John Williams, and in his films attempted to get inside the music-making, shooting rehearsals and the joshing among musicians. (There is a funny scene in the new film in which the players swap instruments and Du Pr\u00e9 tries to play a violin as if it were a cello.) To Nupen, creative artists are heroes whose remarkable gift he wants to communicate. </p> <p>It is a not a view that finds favour with today's programme-makers. Nupen's film was turned down by the BBC, and he didn't offer it to ITV or Channel 4 because he had been given indications that they would not take it up. Channel 5 stepped in with funding, but far less than the BBC - which has shown most of Nupen's films over the past 30 years - would have provided. Hence the money he had to stump up himself. Ironically, a film closer to the early publicity - a head-to-head clash with Hilary and Jackie - might have attracted more interest. </p> <p>But it is not that sort of film. Nupen has raided his archive for some marvellous, previously unseen footage of Du Pr\u00e9 in rehearsal and talked to the people who, in his words, \"knew her best\". He did not invite Hilary and Piers to contribute, and is sure that had he done so they would have refused. There will be no attempt to tell Du Pr\u00e9's life story; rather he wants to capture her essence, \"the way that a room would light up when she walked in\". </p> <p>Nupen looks perplexed when I ask how he will deal with Jackie's affair with Kiffer - if that is the right term for the strange menage a trois with her sister and brother-in-law. Simple - he won't. \"Jackie had had something close to a nervous breakdown,\" he explains. \"I don't think that tells you anything about what kind of a person she was.\" </p> <p>His approach is either admirably purist or absurdly bone-headed. At least Channel 5's welcome conversion to high culture means we will get the chance to judge. </p> <p>\u0095 Who Was Jacqueline Du Pr\u00e9? will be broadcast on Channel 5 on February 18.</p>",

I am a big fan of the National Portrait Gallery, which is manageable and so handy for Soho. Some art is difficult to approach but with a portrait you can easily start with the questions, \"Does it look like someone? And in what way?\" </p> <p>The only thing that distresses me about the National Portrait Gallery is that in all its exhibitions there is (by law, I think) a portrait of Margaret Thatcher. The better the picture, the more it makes you shudder. In Painting the Century: 101 Masterpieces 1900-2000, the Thatcher is a crude but effective satire by Hans Haacke. It is described ominously as \"unfinished\". </p> <p>The exhibition is inevitably a bit of a hotchpotch, but is mostly enjoyable.

      "bodyText": "It is not given to many people to know as much about art as Jeffrey Archer, who not only owns many masterpieces, but is probably also a visiting lecturer in fine art at the Courtauld Institute. Nevertheless, even if you are more ignorant than the great buffoon, there is much pleasure to be had in lurking about art galleries of an afternoon. I am a big fan of the National Portrait Gallery, which is manageable and so handy for Soho. Some art is difficult to approach but with a portrait you can easily start with the questions, \"Does it look like someone? And in what way?\" The only thing that distresses me about the National Portrait Gallery is that in all its exhibitions there is (by law, I think) a portrait of Margaret Thatcher. The better the picture, the more it makes you shudder. In Painting the Century: 101 Masterpieces 1900-2000, the Thatcher is a crude but effective satire by Hans Haacke. It is described ominously as \"unfinished\". The exhibition is inevitably a bit of a hotchpotch, but is mostly enjoyable. Picasso's Woman in a Chemise is subtly erotic and features a beautiful breast. Or does it? A female artist told me once that men can't paint breasts - they always put them too high on the body and don't get the sag right.

Indeed, Max's covert ops training on keeping a low profile includes: \"Travel everywhere by tearing down the middle of the road on a Kawasaki superbike, pulling wheelies as often as you can.\" </p> <p>Max lives in grungey post- apocalyptic Seattle, where some sort of \"electromagnetic pulse\" has wiped out all the computer records, and she teams up with a wheelchair-wielding pirate journalist who hosts a show called \"Streaming Freedom Video Bulletin\" from his immaculate hi-tech loft apartment - I could go on, but it's such a tired old cyberfuture-by-numbers that, if it wasn't so po-faced, it'd be hilarious. Fires burning in discarded oil drums? Check! Cops on the take in full Elian Gonzalez gear? Check! Black kids speaking overmannered street slang? Check! Check! Check! </p> <p>Which brings us to Dark Angel's only unique selling point: Max, aka haughty, pouting hottie Jessica Alba. On the plus side, she's setting an exciting precedent for remaking all kinds of sci-fi classics, but with the leads replaced with teenage girls. 2001: A Space Odyssey - a team of astronauts battle a homicidal computer en route to unveiling mankind's enigmatic origins among the stars. But, due to an administrative mix-up, they're all teenage girls! Blade Runner - a bounty-hunter faces some difficult questions while hunting down android \"replicants\": What does it mean to be human? Can you ever truly distinguish between reality and illusion? And who's cuter: Westlife or Boyzone? </p> <p>Then again, anyone expecting a truly futuristic spin on Buffy (or even Clueless) here will be disappointed. True, Max has her run-ins with ditzy flatmates, drugs, child abuse, and dating (in one of the show's better lines, we learn that boys just can't seem to see beyond \"the whole bioengineered killing-machine thing\"), but Dark Angel borrows Buffy's kick-ass concept without picking up the scathingly self-referential dialogue, the superb supporting characters, and the genius-like subtext of using supernatural nightmares as metaphors for everyday teen concerns (that episode where Buffy sleeps with Angel for the first time, and she doesn't know if it's just a one-night stand or whether an ancient curse has transformed him back into a hideous, soulless demon - but either way: why doesn't he call?) </p> <p>Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator 2, True Lies, Titanic; for all their \"strong female characters\", Cameron's films - with the possible exception of Piranha II: Flying Killers - are rarely noted for their playful sense of humour (for heaven's sake, Dark Angel doesn't even do that Charlie's Angels movie thing of sneaking songs with the word \"Angel\" in them onto the soundtrack). </p> <p>Watching the show, you've got to wonder: what point is Cameron trying to make here? Is he genuinely trying to draw attention to the plight of teenage survivors of secret government genetic manipulation labs? Or the universal human dilemma of how we always lose touch with our friends from primary school? And when we eventually do run into them, we have nothing in common any more? </p> <p>Also, she runs like a girl. </p> <p>\u0095 Dark Angel, 9pm, Sky One.</p>",

On the plus side, she's setting an exciting precedent for remaking all kinds of sci-fi classics, but with the leads replaced with teenage girls. 2001: A Space Odyssey - a team of astronauts battle a homicidal computer en route to unveiling mankind's enigmatic origins among the stars. But, due to an administrative mix-up, they're all teenage girls! Blade Runner - a bounty-hunter faces some difficult questions while hunting down android \"replicants\": What does it mean to be human? Can you ever truly distinguish between reality and illusion? And who's cuter: Westlife or Boyzone? Then again, anyone expecting a truly futuristic spin on Buffy (or even Clueless) here will be disappointed. True, Max has her run-ins with ditzy flatmates, drugs, child abuse, and dating (in one of the show's better lines, we learn that boys just can't seem to see beyond \"the whole bioengineered killing-machine thing\"), but Dark Angel borrows Buffy's kick-ass concept without picking up the scathingly self-referential dialogue, the superb supporting characters, and the genius-like subtext of using supernatural nightmares as metaphors for everyday teen concerns (that episode where Buffy sleeps with Angel for the first time, and she doesn't know if it's just a one-night stand or whether an ancient curse has transformed him back into a hideous, soulless demon - but either way: why doesn't he call?) Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator 2, True Lies, Titanic; for all their \"strong female characters\", Cameron's films - with the possible exception of Piranha II: Flying Killers - are rarely noted for their playful sense of humour (for heaven's sake, Dark Angel doesn't even do that Charlie's Angels movie thing of sneaking songs with the word \"Angel\" in them onto the soundtrack). Watching the show, you've got to wonder: what point is Cameron trying to make here? Is he genuinely trying to draw attention to the plight of teenage survivors of secret government genetic manipulation labs? Or the universal human dilemma of how we always lose touch with our friends from primary school? And when we eventually do run into them, we have nothing in common any more? Also, she runs like a girl. \u0095 Dark Angel, 9pm, Sky One.",

The money was repaid on the orders of former trustees but fresh rows broke out between the patrons and the then trustees over administration costs. The rows over royalties were still continuing after Pavarotti had moved three projects away from the charity. A spokeswoman for Pavarotti said that there had been a dispute for over a year about the fate of \u00a341,894 royalties from a Decca album recording a concert for War Child UK in Modena in 1996.

      "bodyText": "Security forces in south Armagh yesterday intercepted a huge bomb, thought to be the work of dissident republicans, as the Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, called on paramilitaries to get rid of weapons. The find sparked a search of the area for secondary devices and a helicopter was sent in to defuse up to 1,000lb of the homemade explosives, primed for use and packed into two wheelie bins at the side of the busy Monaghan Road. The RUC chief constable, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, warned the public not to become complacent because the police had been successful in thwarting renegade terrorists recently. He added: \"Dissident republicans pose a very real and growing threat.\" The discovery came as efforts to break out of political deadlock intensified, with top US officials involved in negotiations with senior British and Irish civil servants. Just days before US president Bill Clinton leaves the White House, Northern Ireland was obviously still high on his agenda as national security adviser, Jim Steinberg, headed a talks team which visited Belfast at the weekend and was in London last night. Tony Blair's spokesman said the prime minister was in regular contact with the Irish premier, Bertie Ahern, and all other key players. The province's fledgling coalition government is in danger of collapsing as Mr Trimble is under severe pressure from hardliners within his own party to pull out of power-sharing with Sinn Fein unless the IRA makes progress on weapons decommissioning. Sinn Fein wants substantial demilitarisation, particularly of the heavily fortified south Armagh region, but security chiefs insist the threat from dissidents remains too great and this latest bomb attempt will underline their argument. Mr Trimble, speaking at a Catholic boys' secondary school in north Belfast yesterday, said the danger from dissidents and their possible access to mainstream paramilitary arms dumps made the need for disarmament all the more pressing. \"The security of the people of these islands is at risk if the weapons are not put permanently, completely and verifiably beyond use,\" he said. He added that there was considerable disappointment in his party that the IRA had not honoured the promises it made on arms in May and it was now up to republicans to act. Mr Trimble also questioned why people would need to hold on to weapons if they were sincere about promises of not returning to violence. The political battle over policing reform is also still raging, with the nationalist SDLP refusing to nominate representatives to the new police board because it feels the legislation has watered down Chris Patten's recommendations. Sinn Fein said the police bill was unacceptable. But Mr Trimble said that while unionists were also unhappy with the police reforms, although for different reasons, he did not think the legislation would be changed now and nationalists should buckle down and support the new arrangements. He claimed the reforms were already more favourable to nationalists than unionists and that change could only take place from within. \"Most of the matters outstanding for nationalists are operational ones,\" he said. \"They can effect change in that regard by playing a full role as members of the police board.

      "bodyText": "The state-sponsored spas of France are poorly regulated, inefficiently run, fraudulently advertised and may even be bad for the health, according to damning social affairs ministry report released yesterday. For generations as many as 500,000 French men and women suffering from ailments as varied as indigestion, obesity, backache, wheezy chests, stress and varicose veins have flocked each year on their doctor's orders to take the waters at Aix-les-Bains, Vichy, Evian and elsewhere. But the hugely popular three-week cures at these and France's 110 other recognised stations thermales, largely reimbursed by the state at a cost of \u00a3150m a year, are coming under threat from the un-Gallic notion of quality control. Theoretically, the ministry report said, spas have to apply for a permit to operate under a royal decree dating from 1823. But because the decree has never been been translated into legislation, \"thermal establishments are subject to no authorisation or supervision whatsoever\". Nor, the report pointed out, is there any regulation of spa staff. \"They are not required to possess any specific qualification beyond the most basic possible on-the-job training, and as a result numerous reprehensible abuses were detected,\" it said. The 700 different mineral, thermal and spring waters produced and sold in France also needed stricter control and testing, the report continued, as did such expensive and sought-after spa by-products as seaweed, algae and mudpacks - some of which were found to be so germ-infested as to constitute a health risk. More fundamentally, however, the report questioned for the first time the medical benefits of taking the waters - a practice still funded by the social security system in neigh bouring countries such as Belgium and Germany, but dropped by the NHS more than 20 years ago. \"There is no doubt that the therapeutic effectiveness of thermalisme should be placed under some form of permanent evaluation,\" the report said. \"There is some evidence that it may be of use in treating respiratory and dermatological disorders, but the arguments for its use in treating other pathologies are by no means established.\" France's national health insurer, CNAM, seized on the report to threaten to end state reimbursement of all spa treatments until the medical issue is cleared up. \"We want spas to back up the claims they make,\" its director, Gilles Johanet, said. \"We want to see some concrete results.\" The end of state subsidies could prove a catastrophe for spa towns, since curistes are likely to think twice if they are obliged to pay the full going rate for their three weeks of pampering - up to \u00a31,000 - as well as hotel and restaurant bills. \"The spa industry today employs some 120,000 people throughout France,\" said Dr Guy Ebrard, president of the French Thermal and Climatic Federation. \"In many rural regions, like the Auvergne and the Midi-Pyrenees, they are an absolutely vital part of the local economy.\" Jacques Fort\u00e9, the mayor of Dax, France's biggest spa town which welcomes around 55,000 curistes a year, said that the industry would defend itself vigorously against any charges of charlatanism. He added that it had already commissioned specialist studies to prove the benefits of spa treatment. If these measures did not work, Mr Fort\u00e9 went on, then the beleaguered hoteliers, masseurs and hot-water therapists of France's spa towns would start lobbying parliament, 50 or so of whose members are thought to be devoted, if highly discreet, spa-goers.",

It also confers the right to comment on almost any public issue and be listened to attentively.</p> <p>The British rabbi's outlook would come as just as much of a shock to non-Jewish Germans as to members of the Jewish community. \"Every time vandalising of bus shelters comes up in the council, someone from the Jewish community has to go along and say it's all because of anti-semitism,\" he said yesterday.</p> <p>Victory in the election would be sweet revenge for Rabbi Rothschild, a very distant relative of the banking family. The present head of the Jewish community dismissed him last year from his job as rabbi of Berlin's liberal community.</p> <p>The move came amid controversy over Rabbi Rothschild's sometimes unconventional approach to his job. Some members of the Jewish establishment in the city were appalled when he produced a condom during a service to illustrate a point in his sermon.</p> <p>He won reinstatement through the courts but then negotiated a severance deal which took effect at the end of last month. He is at present a freelance rabbi ministering to the Progressive community.</p> <p>Last week, Rabbi Rothschild was in the news after being attacked on the Berlin underground.</p> <p>He suffered cuts and bruises after being punched in the face following an altercation with a group of youths.

      "bodyText": "A British rabbi yesterday put himself up for election as leader of Berlin's Jewish community - one of the most politically sensitive posts in the Jewish world. Walter Rothschild said his platform would be that Jewish representatives in Germany were \"spending far too much time on external matters, like anti-semitism and [Berlin's unbuilt] Holocaust memorial at the expense of the internal life of the community\". Rabbi Rothschild, who served in Leeds from 1984 to 1994, worked in Austria, central Europe and the Caribbean before his arrival in 1998 in Berlin, where he has been at the centre of controversy. His campaign promises yet more fireworks. In a characteristically provocative opening salvo, which clearly alluded to the Nazi gas chambers, he declared: \"We're living off the ashes and I don't like that.\" Leadership of the Jewish community brings with it responsibility for a sizeable budget of DM48m (\u00a316m) and staff of about 400. It also confers the right to comment on almost any public issue and be listened to attentively. The British rabbi's outlook would come as just as much of a shock to non-Jewish Germans as to members of the Jewish community. \"Every time vandalising of bus shelters comes up in the council, someone from the Jewish community has to go along and say it's all because of anti-semitism,\" he said yesterday. Victory in the election would be sweet revenge for Rabbi Rothschild, a very distant relative of the banking family. The present head of the Jewish community dismissed him last year from his job as rabbi of Berlin's liberal community. The move came amid controversy over Rabbi Rothschild's sometimes unconventional approach to his job. Some members of the Jewish establishment in the city were appalled when he produced a condom during a service to illustrate a point in his sermon. He won reinstatement through the courts but then negotiated a severance deal which took effect at the end of last month. He is at present a freelance rabbi ministering to the Progressive community. Last week, Rabbi Rothschild was in the news after being attacked on the Berlin underground. He suffered cuts and bruises after being punched in the face following an altercation with a group of youths. Police said later they had arrested three young men.",

Oscar Flores, who has spent two days helping emergency workers to search for an old school friend and his family, said: \"We've dug out two rooms and now we're moving on to clearing the garage. \"They must be somewhere in there.\" But like an increasing number of people, Mr Flores admitted that he was slowly accepting the fate of his friends. \"I want to make this effort, so that afterwards no one can say that I didn't at least try to find their bodies.\" Angry residents have been blaming the government for the mudslide. Despite their warnings it allowed more houses to be build on the side of the mountain above the buried suburb. Ricardo Navarro, an ecologist, said: \"We said hundreds of times to the government and the construction industry that the tree line on this hillside should not be destroyed ... But several urbanisation projects were born, and there you have the results.\" \"This disaster could have been avoided,\" Tomas Castellano, 64, said as tears welled in his eyes. \"I can only think of my two little grandchildren who died here.\"",

Some may go out to grass, but most are raised indoors in intensive housing.

Calves taken from their mothers at birth suffer an increased risk of infectious diseases - ie, diarrhoea and pneumonia - because of their artificial food and the intensive housing. However, grazing cattle can suffer similar digestive problems if left on grass alone. \"A steady, nutritional diet of cereal might be the best thing for them,\" says Mac Johnson, a professor of veterinary health. <br><b> 4/10</b> </p> <p><b>Stress prior to death</b></p> <p>John Webster, professor of animal husbandry at Bristol University's Vet School, says that recent EU regulations have led to smaller and smaller numbers of ever bigger slaughter houses. \"As a result, cows are having to be moved much longer distances and handled with much less care than they would be in smaller, local slaughter houses. The cattle are frequently stressed by the novelty and fear of the transport process and movement and mixing of groups.\" <br><b> 7/10</b> </p> <p><b>Suffering during slaughter</b></p> <p>Professor Webster argues that the problem of killing the farmed animals is the anguish caused in the run-up to death, rather than the slaughter technique itself: the cows are killed instantly by a bullet to the head. <br><b> 1/10</b> </p> <p> <b>Total: 18</b></p> <p><b>Hunted fox</b></p> <p><b>Living conditions</b> <br><br> Humans have eroded the habitat of foxes through the destruction of hedgerows and woodland. But Dr Rob Atkinson, head of the wildlife department of the RSPCA, argues that the country fox's nature makes it extremely adaptable to most environments. \"They construct territories to encompass food supplies that will keep them and their dependants for at least a year,\" he says. \"Hence the appearance of the town fox in recent decades.\" <br><b> 0/10</b> </p> <p><b>Health and diet</b></p> <p>Foxes are omnivorous. They will gravitate towards the most abundant food source, such as rubbish tips or country farms. According to Atkinson, city foxes are at risk from traffic and mange (which wiped out most of Bristol's population some years ago). The hunted, country foxes that live near farms run the risk of traps and shotguns. <br><b> 2/10</b></p> <p><b>Stress prior to death</b></p> <p>The pre-death distress of a hunted fox is less prolonged but more intense than any farm animal. However, so short-lived is the \"chase\" experience that some argue the hunted fox suffers less distress than foxes that die of natural diseases such as mange. However, the very real sense of fear and eventual desperation can produce severe stress in hunted animals in the run-up to death. <br><b>7/10</b></p> <p><b>Suffering during slaughter</b></p> <p>Last year, research by Birmingham University veterinary surgeons showed that it is rare for hunted foxes to be killed instantly. Rather, says Professor David Morton, who headed the study: \"A dog will get hold of the fox by the leg or by the tail while the rest attack it.

They don't respond at all.\" But because of hygiene requirements, there's pressure on farmers to use an abattoir. \"The real difficulty for the deer is being taken away from the habitat they're used to in lorries. If anything, welfare is deteriorating due to hygiene requirements for humans.\" <br><b>5/10</b></p> <p><b>Suffering during slaughter</b></p> <p>A bolt fired from a pistol kills the deer outright. <br><b> 1/10</b> </p> <p><b>Total: 10</b></p> <p><b>Non free-range broiler chickens</b></p> <p><b>Living conditions</b></p> <p>\"Broiler chickens are probably the worst-treated farm animals,\" says Professor John Webster, who specialises in their welfare. With poor living conditions in extremely densely populated sheds and bone defects, he says 25% of broiler chickens are in pain for 25% of their lives. One recommendation is for only seven hens per square metre - 15.5 per square metre if cages are stacked on top of each other. <br><b>9/10</b></p> <p><b>Health and diet</b></p> <p>In most cases, the diet is designed to make them grow as fast as possible as quickly as possible, which causes abnormalities of bones; as they grow fatter they outgrow their strength, which leads to joint problems.

Healthy chickens do not do this. <br><b>9/10</b></p> <p><b>Stress prior to death</b></p> <p>Again, there are problems with transport. They will almost certainly be too hot or too cold, which causes stress. The cramped transport cages exacerbate the problems they have with their already pained legs.

      "body": "<p>Most of those who finally get indicted for the 5.2m offences in the new crime figures leading the headlines this morning will appear before unpaid fellow citizens (considerably more middle class than the usual run of offender) who give up half a day a week to dispense justice voluntarily. These form the lay magistracy of England and Wales.</p> <p>Magistrates' numbers have increased, as the chart shows, though case load has been broadly level. But in recent years lay magistrates have been losing out to the profes sionals. Volunteers are being usurped by the growing number of \"stipendiaries\" - district judges in effect - who now hear a third of all cases in many big cities. Today's 100-odd stipendiaries are double the number a decade ago.</p> <p>No fewer than 95 of every 100 criminal cases are heard in magistrates' courts rather than before a judge and jury. If the Labour government got its way and secured the passage of the mode of trial bill that was halted in the Lords last autumn, an even larger proportion of the serious cases for which defendants may currently opt for jury trial would be dealt with by magistrates.</p> <p>So what is the difference between the two classes of magistrate? Offenders do not know in advance whether they are to be tried by amateurs or professionals. In no other legal system does chance determine whether a case is heard by a panel of lay people or by a stipendiary, sitting alone. Only in England and Wales are paid and unpaid magistrates used interchangeably, as if the skills they bring to court were the same.</p> <p>They are not. Lay magistrates bring their local knowledge to the courts along with a broad range of social experience and a freshness in hearing evidence that is valuable in assessing character. They may better be able to judge honesty and the risk of reoffending. Professional lawyers, on the other hand, are experts and can handle increasingly complex legislation. They hear cases more quickly and with greater consistency. They have no need for the legal advice from justices' clerks on which lay magistrates rely.</p> <p>The qualities which lay and professional people bring to the party are thus complementary rather than interchangeable. In contested cases, both sets of skills are needed. In Community Justice, published today, Profes sor Andrew Sanders of Manchester University argues contested cases should always be heard by a mixed panel of two lay and one professional. There is significant support for that model among the public at large. In every serious case, the decision on guilt or innocence and on sentence would be based on that essential combination of legal expertise and lay judgment. Uncontested cases and routine applications for bail could safely be heard by district judges, sitting alone, as they rely on legal rather than \"social\" decision-making skills.</p> <p>If lay magistrates were never to hear cases in the absence of a professional judge they would need less expertise and training and sit less often in court. Serving on the bench would no longer need to be a prerogative of the middle classes and the over 60s. Many more might be willing to contribute, say, a half day per fortnight for two to five years: the system would be more participative, more jury-like.</p> <p>Lay magistrates have recently come to feel they are under close examination, perhaps even threat. At the end of last year the Home Office and Lord Chancellor's department published a detailed comparative study of the cost and effectiveness of the different types of magistrate by Professor Rod Morgan of Bristol University; a judge, Sir Robin Auld, is reviewing the staffing of the lower courts.</p> <p>Yet chancellor Gordon Brown has recently be extolling the volunteer spirit and the Magistrates Association is a formidable interest group which can raise a fuss, if it cares to. What is clear is that the status quo is not an option - because public confidence in magistrates as presently constituted is alarmingly low. Only 29% of the public think they do a good job. Some 61% believe they are out of touch. But the public are themselves out of touch, vastly underestimating the volume of cases heard in the lower courts. Four people out of 10 are unaware that most magistrates are lay people. One in two are concerned to learn that they do not have full legal training. Yet for every person who told Professor Sanders they wanted a legally qualified person involved (\"If the people are not trained as lawyers, I don't think I would have confidence in them\") another welcomed the community ties and voluntary commitment of the lay members.</p> <p>Mixed panels would cost more than either a judge sitting alone or lay magistrates alone. But the number of cases for which a panel would be needed would be small relative to the whole. Cost savings would be made when judges sat alone for the routine, uncontested cases and because legally-qualified clerks would no longer be needed to advise on the law.</p> <p>Lay magistrates are likely to see this proposal as demotion. The gain would be the greater transparency from the involvement of a broader cross-section of the community, the greater efficiency of court proceedings and confidence in the decisions taken. When violent crime is rising, yet confidence in the courts is so low, the question is not whether to reform the system, only when.</p> <p>\u0095 Sarah Spencer is at the Institute for Public Policy Research, which is publishing Community Justice, Modernising the Magistracy in England and Wales, by Andrew Sanders.<br> <a href=\"mailto:sasippr@aol.com\">sasippr@aol.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Most of those who finally get indicted for the 5.2m offences in the new crime figures leading the headlines this morning will appear before unpaid fellow citizens (considerably more middle class than the usual run of offender) who give up half a day a week to dispense justice voluntarily. These form the lay magistracy of England and Wales. Magistrates' numbers have increased, as the chart shows, though case load has been broadly level. But in recent years lay magistrates have been losing out to the profes sionals. Volunteers are being usurped by the growing number of \"stipendiaries\" - district judges in effect - who now hear a third of all cases in many big cities. Today's 100-odd stipendiaries are double the number a decade ago. No fewer than 95 of every 100 criminal cases are heard in magistrates' courts rather than before a judge and jury. If the Labour government got its way and secured the passage of the mode of trial bill that was halted in the Lords last autumn, an even larger proportion of the serious cases for which defendants may currently opt for jury trial would be dealt with by magistrates. So what is the difference between the two classes of magistrate? Offenders do not know in advance whether they are to be tried by amateurs or professionals. In no other legal system does chance determine whether a case is heard by a panel of lay people or by a stipendiary, sitting alone. Only in England and Wales are paid and unpaid magistrates used interchangeably, as if the skills they bring to court were the same. They are not. Lay magistrates bring their local knowledge to the courts along with a broad range of social experience and a freshness in hearing evidence that is valuable in assessing character. They may better be able to judge honesty and the risk of reoffending. Professional lawyers, on the other hand, are experts and can handle increasingly complex legislation. They hear cases more quickly and with greater consistency. They have no need for the legal advice from justices' clerks on which lay magistrates rely. The qualities which lay and professional people bring to the party are thus complementary rather than interchangeable. In contested cases, both sets of skills are needed. In Community Justice, published today, Profes sor Andrew Sanders of Manchester University argues contested cases should always be heard by a mixed panel of two lay and one professional. There is significant support for that model among the public at large. In every serious case, the decision on guilt or innocence and on sentence would be based on that essential combination of legal expertise and lay judgment. Uncontested cases and routine applications for bail could safely be heard by district judges, sitting alone, as they rely on legal rather than \"social\" decision-making skills. If lay magistrates were never to hear cases in the absence of a professional judge they would need less expertise and training and sit less often in court. Serving on the bench would no longer need to be a prerogative of the middle classes and the over 60s. Many more might be willing to contribute, say, a half day per fortnight for two to five years: the system would be more participative, more jury-like. Lay magistrates have recently come to feel they are under close examination, perhaps even threat. At the end of last year the Home Office and Lord Chancellor's department published a detailed comparative study of the cost and effectiveness of the different types of magistrate by Professor Rod Morgan of Bristol University; a judge, Sir Robin Auld, is reviewing the staffing of the lower courts. Yet chancellor Gordon Brown has recently be extolling the volunteer spirit and the Magistrates Association is a formidable interest group which can raise a fuss, if it cares to. What is clear is that the status quo is not an option - because public confidence in magistrates as presently constituted is alarmingly low. Only 29% of the public think they do a good job. Some 61% believe they are out of touch. But the public are themselves out of touch, vastly underestimating the volume of cases heard in the lower courts. Four people out of 10 are unaware that most magistrates are lay people. One in two are concerned to learn that they do not have full legal training. Yet for every person who told Professor Sanders they wanted a legally qualified person involved (\"If the people are not trained as lawyers, I don't think I would have confidence in them\") another welcomed the community ties and voluntary commitment of the lay members. Mixed panels would cost more than either a judge sitting alone or lay magistrates alone. But the number of cases for which a panel would be needed would be small relative to the whole. Cost savings would be made when judges sat alone for the routine, uncontested cases and because legally-qualified clerks would no longer be needed to advise on the law. Lay magistrates are likely to see this proposal as demotion. The gain would be the greater transparency from the involvement of a broader cross-section of the community, the greater efficiency of court proceedings and confidence in the decisions taken. When violent crime is rising, yet confidence in the courts is so low, the question is not whether to reform the system, only when. \u0095 Sarah Spencer is at the Institute for Public Policy Research, which is publishing Community Justice, Modernising the Magistracy in England and Wales, by Andrew Sanders. sasippr@aol.com",

It also reported that interim pre-tax profits had fallen to \u00a389m in the six months to October 28 from \u00a3210m last time and the second half was looking even tougher. </p> <p>Shareholders led by David Herro had been pressing for the departure of Mr Wambold, a Lazard Freres banker who was chairman of Tomkins' audit committee. </p> <p>Mr Herro, an American fund manager, accused Mr Wambold of being too close to Mr Hutchings, the former chief executive who left the group amid controversy last October. </p> <p>Mr Wambold was criticised for failing to halt Mr Hutchings' use of corporate perks such as a fleet of jets and flats in London. Mr Hutchings'wife was also on the payroll. </p> <p>Mr Wambold said yesterday that he had always made clear he would quit the Tomkins board once matters leading to Mr Hutchings' resignation had been satisfactorily reviewed and the company had embarked on a clear strategic direction aimed at rebuilding shareholder value. </p> <p>\"These conditions have now been effectively been completed and this is the right time to step down.\" </p> <p>Mr Newland pointed out that Mr Wambold was one of Tomkins' longest serving non-executives and added: \"We are grateful to him for this contribution to the board.\" </p> <p>Tomkins' interim financial results showed sales falling from \u00a32.6bn to \u00a32.4bn but the company cheered the City by holding its interim dividend and saying it would complete the second half of a large share buyback programme. </p> <p>Mr Newlands said the company had produced a robust set of financial results in a difficult market but, having investigated the possibility of a break-up, had concluded it would not maximise shareholder value in the near term. </p> <p>If a number of planned initiatives - such as the sale of its Smith &amp; Wesson handgun business - failed to raise the share price, he would look again at some kind of unbundling. He also pointed out that no settlement had yet been made with Mr Hutchings nor was necessarily expected. </p> <p>Tomkins shares ended the day down 2.5p at 157.5p.</p>",

The company chairman, David Newlands, gave a lukewarm goodbye to Mr Wambold adding: \"Today we draw a line under the past and look to the future.\" The departure came as the engineering group said it had completed its strategic review but had ruled out any \"immediate\" break-up of the business. It also reported that interim pre-tax profits had fallen to \u00a389m in the six months to October 28 from \u00a3210m last time and the second half was looking even tougher. Shareholders led by David Herro had been pressing for the departure of Mr Wambold, a Lazard Freres banker who was chairman of Tomkins' audit committee. Mr Herro, an American fund manager, accused Mr Wambold of being too close to Mr Hutchings, the former chief executive who left the group amid controversy last October. Mr Wambold was criticised for failing to halt Mr Hutchings' use of corporate perks such as a fleet of jets and flats in London. Mr Hutchings'wife was also on the payroll. Mr Wambold said yesterday that he had always made clear he would quit the Tomkins board once matters leading to Mr Hutchings' resignation had been satisfactorily reviewed and the company had embarked on a clear strategic direction aimed at rebuilding shareholder value. \"These conditions have now been effectively been completed and this is the right time to step down.\" Mr Newland pointed out that Mr Wambold was one of Tomkins' longest serving non-executives and added: \"We are grateful to him for this contribution to the board.\" Tomkins' interim financial results showed sales falling from \u00a32.6bn to \u00a32.4bn but the company cheered the City by holding its interim dividend and saying it would complete the second half of a large share buyback programme. Mr Newlands said the company had produced a robust set of financial results in a difficult market but, having investigated the possibility of a break-up, had concluded it would not maximise shareholder value in the near term. If a number of planned initiatives - such as the sale of its Smith &amp; Wesson handgun business - failed to raise the share price, he would look again at some kind of unbundling. He also pointed out that no settlement had yet been made with Mr Hutchings nor was necessarily expected. Tomkins shares ended the day down 2.5p at 157.5p.",

      "body": "<p>California's energy crisis turned into a high-stakes poker game yesterday when one of the state's two leading utilities defaulted on almost $600m (\u00a3430m) worth of debt repayments. </p> <p>The move came as Californians were warned that the state - the home of Silicon Valley - faced the renewed prospect of rolling black-outs because of demand coming within a whisker of total available generating capacity. </p> <p>The decision by Southern California Edison (SCE) to suspend $596m of payments due to creditors is expected to increase the pressure on negotiators, including the governor of California and the outgoing Clinton administration, to find a solution to the crisis but could push the company closer to bankruptcy if other creditors call in their loans. </p> <p>Analysts are worried that SCE's move could affect sentiment towards the whole utilities sector. \"There could be a knock-on effect on other utilities not just in the US, because people will say if it can happen there it could happen anywhere. Even though the circumstances surrounding this are different, it is a question of sentiment,\" said Neil Bendall at Barclays Capital. </p> <p>Worries about the financial health of the two Californian investor-owned utilities and potential consequences for banks which have lent them money have sent shivers through financial markets.

      "bodyText": "California's energy crisis turned into a high-stakes poker game yesterday when one of the state's two leading utilities defaulted on almost $600m (\u00a3430m) worth of debt repayments. The move came as Californians were warned that the state - the home of Silicon Valley - faced the renewed prospect of rolling black-outs because of demand coming within a whisker of total available generating capacity. The decision by Southern California Edison (SCE) to suspend $596m of payments due to creditors is expected to increase the pressure on negotiators, including the governor of California and the outgoing Clinton administration, to find a solution to the crisis but could push the company closer to bankruptcy if other creditors call in their loans. Analysts are worried that SCE's move could affect sentiment towards the whole utilities sector. \"There could be a knock-on effect on other utilities not just in the US, because people will say if it can happen there it could happen anywhere. Even though the circumstances surrounding this are different, it is a question of sentiment,\" said Neil Bendall at Barclays Capital. Worries about the financial health of the two Californian investor-owned utilities and potential consequences for banks which have lent them money have sent shivers through financial markets. Earlier this month, Bank of America had to rebut speculation that it was sitting on heavy losses from the utilities sector. Announcing fourth-quarter results yesterday, America's largest commercial bank said its exposure to Californian utilities was only a small part of its overall exposure. In response to SCE's default, the debt rating agency Moody's Investors Services cut its assessment of SCE debt and that of its parent Edison International to junk status, putting both in default of various bank loans and credit lines. The Californian crisis stems from a sharp rise in wholesale electricity prices which, because of the post-deregulation structure of the industry, cannot be passed on to consumers. SCE and the state's other big utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electricity, are reported to have run up uncovered costs of some $12bn. SCE's share of that cost is some $4.5bn. Yesterday SCE claimed the California energy market \"in its current form is dysfunctional\". Average wholesale prices last month rose 900% compared with December 1999, it said. SEC has some $1.2bn in cash but without the suspension of debt payments would have run out of money on February 2. The debt payments suspension was designed to allow it to keep supplying electricity. In a filing to the US securities and exchange commission the company said that it was trying to avoid bankruptcy and intended to meet all of its obligations once a solution to the pricing crisis had been found. \"However, the crisis requires a regulatory solution, which is not likely to occur immediately.\" \"This is a rugged step towards moving the process along and forcing California to do something,\" according to Jerry Bellucci at the New York based energy consulting firm Applied Economic Research. SCE acknowledged that yesterday's decision could trigger defaults on other portions of its debt and warned that \"it is possible SCE could be forced into bankruptcy\". Last night there were warnings that some creditors were pressing for bankruptcy, although in the SEC filing the company had warned in such circumstances \"payments to vendors, suppliers and creditors would be subject to significant delays associated with the bankruptcy process\".",

As activists from both sides shouted slogans outside the Senate, Mr Ashcroft faced tough questioning from the Senate judiciary committee, controlled by Democrats, who depicted him as a rightwing extremist bent on using the country's top judicial post to pursue a personal agenda of opposing abortion rights and civil rights legislation. The hearings have begun during the short period in which the Democrats hold the chairmanship of the newly elected Senate, which is divided 50-50 between the two parties. Until Dick Cheney becomes vice-president on Saturday, Al Gore holds the deciding vote. Leading the attack against Mr Ashcroft, Senator Ted Kennedy, said: \"Unfortunately, and often, he has used his high office to advance his personal views in spite of the law of the land.\" On the issue of gun rights, Mr Kennedy said: \"Senator Ashcroft is so far out of the mainstream that he has said citizens need to be armed in order to protect themselves against a tyrannical government.

The Bush camp claims that the opposition to Mr Ashcroft is purely political and says that it will make a stand to defend his appointment.

Far more than Southall and Paddington, Hatfield has exposed the shortcomings of the privatised industry: that the reason for not fixing broken rails more quickly was because it preferred putting profits before safety. Putting it as starkly as this suggests that Railtrack, or its contractors, or both, could find themselves facing criminal charges as the post-Hatfield saga unwinds. keith.harper@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "The newly bereaved would be incredulous if they knew what really happened when their loved ones were buried, MPs heard yesterday as they were warned of a \"looming crisis\" in overcrowding in cemeteries. With no regulatory organisation to oversee them, undertakers are packing bodies into old graves or cramming them in on top of them, despite it being illegal to do so. \"It's an area of funeral activity that it's virtually impossible to police, but people would be shocked and surprised if they really knew what was happening,\" Giles Dolphin, a chartered town planner, told MPs on the environment sub-committee. \"I know of some private cemeteries, built in the 1870s, that should have been full 40 or 50 years ago but they're still burying 600 or 700 people a year and I ask where they're putting them?\" Mr Dolphin was giving evidence to MPs on the problems facing cemeteries as 28% of the population opt for being buried rather than cremated. Referring to the situation in the capital, where he works for the Greater London authority, Mr Dolphin said the problem of overcrowding in cemeteries was \"urgent in two thirds of Greater London and in some parts, past urgent.\" \"There's a crisis looming, particularly in Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Westminster where they have no sites at all,\" he said, adding that each London borough had, on average, just 13 years to go before running out of burial space - with Enfield having just one year, Ealing six months, Hammersmith and Fulham, two, and Brent, three. The crisis had first occurred in the 1950s, but had been eased by the numbers of cremations soaring from 4% to 72%. Now the problem had reached breaking point, with 629,000 homes being built in London over the next 20 years creating more demands on land. Mr Dolphin, who has led research into the burial needs of London, said there were various short term solutions including squeezing new graves between spaciously laid 19th-century graves, reclaiming unused space in family graves after 75 years and raising land by up to 20 feet to place new graves on top of old ones. But none of these options was ideal: reclaiming unused space was expensive, raising land led to unpleasant burial mountains, and digging up the paths and flowerbeds of Victorian cemeteries destroyed their character and quality. Instead Mr Dolphin, supported by the Church of England and the United Reformed Church, advocated reusing old graves by using a concept known as \"lift and deepen\". Under this, an old grave would be opened and dug deeper with the remains exhumed and then reverently reinterred lower than they were before. Up to five new burials could then occur on top. Calling for this measure - floated in a Home Office consultation document 18 months ago, but then apparently forgotten - Mr Dolphin said reusing graves that were 75 years old \"would virtually guarantee that London could bury its dead within existing cemetery boundaries indefinitely\". But Douglas Davies, a theology professor from Durham University, told the committee graves should be reused after just 50 years. The academic - who has conducted the most thorough study of attitudes to cemeteries and death in the UK, interviewing 1,600 people face-to-face - added that 27% of the public favoured graves being re-used after 75 years, and 23% accepted the 50-year level But overall support soared from 50% to 62% when told of the \"lift and deepen\" method, suggesting that the public was not as squeamish as the government might believe. \"The public is not a child when it comes to discussing death,\" he said. Mr Dolphin, who was also backed by representatives from the Confederation of Burial Authorities, stressed the need for an inspectorate to provide an independent means of regulating the method. He said records would have to be kept of the age of all graves, that there would have to be uniformity in the age at which they were exhumed, that there were no objections from living relatives, no compulsion to be buried there, and no damage to the natural environment.",

They make us realise what we have been taking for granted and what we have to lose. I found it difficult at first but the teachers make you feel easier. It's given me confidence, helped me go for things. I'm at Stockport College now, doing an IT course and a website design course. I'm doing really well. I owe the course a lot. My attitude has changed. I've a lot more confidence in myself. I want to keep out of trouble now because we've just had a baby daughter.\"",

Under the culture and recreation bill, due to get its second reading in the Lords tomorrow, Mr Smith will no longer seek to require boards of trustees to \"consult\" the secretary of state or prime minister over their choice of chairman. He has also promised to amend the bill - drafted in a heavy-handed way, he now admits - so that it will not give him or his successors the power to vary the terms and membership of trusts \"after consulting\" their boards, but only \"with agreement\" of the boards. Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate galleries in London, confirmed last night that this was an acceptable compromise. \"I feel Chris Smith has shown he is not power hungry and has shown he is prepared to listen.\" Mr Smith assured his 20-strong delegation there was \"no intention to remove the right of trustees to choose their own chairman where applicable.\" Before Monday night's meeting the museums and galleries lobby was genuinely alarmed, less fearful of Mr Smith than of more predatory politicians who might one day use such powers to impose a partisan cultural agenda. The museums had accused Mr Smith of New Labour \"control freakery\" and blamed his officials for pressing their own agenda on the minister in the name of a \"tidying up\" operation on the trusteeships of ancient and varied bodies like the National Gallery, the Imperial War Museum, and both the Victoria &amp; Albert and the Science museums.",

The method of execution in Texas has in fact been lethal injection since 1962. The third column in our Leading scorers table on the Football results page (page 4) of Sport, January 15, showed goals per game, rather than, as the title wrongly indicated, games per goal. At the end of the diary by Nebojsa Romcevic, of the last days in power of Slobodan Milosevic, our Saturday Review front, January 13, we mentioned Romcevic's latest published play Cordon. We should have said it appears in the anthology Balkan Plots (Aurora Metro Press, \u00a39.95, ISBN 0-9536757-3-4.) In the caption to the photograph with Blue Peter bodge, page 16, G2, yesterday, we transposed the names of John Noakes and Peter Purves. Homophone corner, from Dilemma for defeated Dokic, page 34, Sport, yesterday, where we spoke of the possibility of the tennis player's father swooping on Tennis Australia officials \"to reek a horrible revenge before the... family leave for their new life in Florida\".

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England faced a growing clamour for a cut in interest rates yesterday after official figures showed inflation fell further below the government's 2.5% target in December. Cheaper petrol and tough competition on the high street forced down the underlying rate of price rises, excluding mortgages, to 2% from November's 2.2%, marking 21 months in a row that inflation has been below target. Core inflation pressure remained subdued, with clothing and footwear prices falling by an annual average of 3.8%, the biggest drop since 1949; household goods by 0.9%, the largest decline since 1959; and food prices by 0.3%, the best performance for consumers since 1960. Last night, the Bank of England governor, Sir Eddie George, played down hopes of significant reductions in rates, saying that although the monetary policy committee was ready to act if the outlook for growth deteriorated, the economy could expect \"steady progress\" over the next two years. However, economists said that with inflation likely to fall further in the months ahead, the MPC might be forced to reduce the cost of borrowing soon even if growth remained relatively strong. \"British inflation has now been below 2.5% for 21 consecutive months, largely under buoyant world economic conditions and rising commodity prices,\" said Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec. \"Even if US activity does not collapse, a normalisation of global growth could help this last for a further 18-24 months, presenting the MPC with the prospect of systematic undershooting of the inflation target for a total of almost four years. This would certainly justify the committee bringing down rates at some point.\" The figures, published by the Office for National Statistics, showed that over the year as a whole, underlying inflation averaged 2.1%, the lowest figure since records began in 1976 and down from 2.3% in 1999. Headline inflation, which fell to 2.9% in December from 3.2% in November, edged higher, averaging 3% compared to 1.5% in 1999, due to mortgage rate rises in the first half of the year. David Walton, an economist at US investment bank Gold man Sachs, said underlying inflation would have been even lower if it had not been for last year's petrol price surge, averaging 1.6% - just above the 1.5% level which triggers an explanatory note from Sir Eddie to the Chancellor, Gordon Brown. James Shugg, economist at Westpac, said: \"This does make the case even more compelling for a rate cut in February. It will be very difficult for the Bank of England's inflation projections to be stuck at 2.5% on a two-year view if they maintain rates at 6%.\" Ian Brinkley, senior economist at the TUC, said: \"You can nearly always see something that might cause inflation in the future but in this case there's nothing.

      "bodyText": "Four women found in a house near Dublin last summer starved themselves to death, an inquest was told yesterday. Frances Mulrooney, 83, and her three nieces, Josephine, 46, and twins Catherine and Ruth, 51, were discovered by their landlord on makeshift beds in downstairs rooms of their home at Leixlip, Co Kildare, in July. At first it was believed they may have been asphyxiated, but the inquest was told by a gas company expert that tests carried out in the house showed that the central heating system was working normally. Police said that while the heating was turned up and some doors and the chimney had been blocked, the ventilation system was clear. Until their bodies were found, none of the women had been seen in public for four months. The inquest heard of notes written by Ruth Mulrooney. In one, written to Josephine, Ruth said that they had not eaten for 36 days and appealed for \"some medical intervention\". The note said that none of them could have thought \"our deaths would be so slow and while the idea of ascending into heaven together is a good one, we did not envisage this\". It added: \"We must do something to get ourselves out of this slow, painful hell. There is no happiness or justice in earth; everything is transient.\" The notes were not dated. But Ruth Mulrooney also wrote to two friends in letters dated June 12 - which were discovered with a written request that they should be sent on - saying that the correspondence would be her last, and asking the friends \"not to grieve for me\". She wrote of \"going into a spiritual world\" and said she would look down upon her friends. Only sections of the letters were read to the court on the instructions of the coroner, Dr Denis Cusack. Deputy state pathologist, Dr Marie Cassidy, said post-mortem examinations had shown that three of the women had died from starvation, but that Frances Mulrooney may have died from pneumonia brought on by food deprivation. She said their fasting was \"probably deliberate\", and they may have been dead for several weeks before their bodies were found. The inquest was told that Mrs Mulrooney and her nieces moved to Leixlip after being evicted from their previous home in Dublin. Initially, part of their monthly rent was paid by the Eastern Health Board in Ireland, but that arrangement was ended last March. The landlord, Trevor Burns, was delivering a note telling the women to vacate the premises when he found the bodies. The inquest jury returned a verdict of suicide in the case of each woman.",

At <a href=\"http://www.lucycarr.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Lucy Carr</a> the Welsh former mortgage saleswoman imparts acres of heartwarming details about the hirsute club owner. \"Peter can wear anything, because he's famous,\" she notes. \"He can wear a bright purple suit when a normal bloke would get the mickey taken out of him.

Project Ginger, we now learn, was also the title of a 1985 movie, certificate 18, starring far too many actors with ridiculous names to avoid the conclusion that it is, in fact, a porn film, apparently concerning a saucy college science project. \"It started in science and ended in biology,\" runs the steamy if logically incoherent tagline.

Roddy Campbell of Kelso returns from a holiday in Malta to report seeing the professor quoted on the front of the Malta Independent. \"It was something about people being depressed by returning to work in January,\" Mr Campbell recalls, \"but it was so fatuous that I really didn't pay it much attention\". What can it mean, this sudden need to be quoted in the foreign press too? We vaguely consider calling Dr Raj Persaud for an in-depth psychological explanation, but decide not to bother. \u0095 It's not every day that an important nugget of top-secret Westminster gossip falls into the Diary's lap, and this isn't one of them, so we'll have to content ourselves instead with the amusing tale of how TGWU leader Bill Morris missed a meeting in Zurich this week to try to persuade GM bosses to save Vauxhall's Luton plant because he'd forgotten his passport. Sorry - it was either that or the one about how the Gordon Brown dog chews at Politico's Bookshop in Westminster have been remaindered at \u00a31.99, while Tony Blair and William Hague continue to walk off the shelves at \u00a37.99. \u0095 Some jaded, cynical naysayers might argue that we know too much already about the private life of Peter Stringfellow, but Lucy Carr, Stringy's youthful lap-dancing belle du jour, isn't one of them. At Lucy Carr the Welsh former mortgage saleswoman imparts acres of heartwarming details about the hirsute club owner. \"Peter can wear anything, because he's famous,\" she notes. \"He can wear a bright purple suit when a normal bloke would get the mickey taken out of him. Peter's even paid to have my eyesight corrected with laser treatment. He's very romantic like that.\" Elsewhere, Lucy dispenses useful tips on How To Lap-Dance For Your Man. Step one, sensibly, is \"Have a bath or a shower\". \u0095 A strange linguistic occurrence in the latest edition of the Labour party's unputdownable Rose newsletter. Readers are invited to locate recent government achievements hidden in a wordsearch, but the choice of filler words is curious. \"Tax extra hospital beds,\" reads the first line. \u0095 We can throw a little light on Project Ginger, the world-changing invention shrouded in impregnable mystery except for the fact that it's an electric scooter and not very good. Project Ginger, we now learn, was also the title of a 1985 movie, certificate 18, starring far too many actors with ridiculous names to avoid the conclusion that it is, in fact, a porn film, apparently concerning a saucy college science project. \"It started in science and ended in biology,\" runs the steamy if logically incoherent tagline. Exactly what kind of not-very-good electric scooter is this going to be? diary@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "In his last week in office, President Clinton was diagnosed with skin cancer yesterday after a lesion was removed from his back for analysis, but the White House said it was a common form of the disease which is almost always curable. Jake Siewert, the chief White House spokesman, said the lesion was discovered on Friday during a medical check-up at the Bethesda naval hospital and had been identified as basal cell carcinoma. \"The lesion was removed, so while the president, it can be said, had skin cancer, that has been removed and he no longer has it,\" Mr Siewert said. He said the risk of recurrence was low. \"Pathologists noted that the margin of the lesion appeared clean, which indicates that the lesion had been totally removed,\" he said. \"In addition, at the time of the biopsy, Mr Clinton elected to have the tissue around the lesion treated superficially with a technique called 'scraping and burning', in the event that the lesion was to be confirmed as skin cancer.\" The \"scraping and burning\" technique is intended to remove all cancerous cells from the area, but it makes the region of the skin more vulnerable to the sun. After eight years of robust health in office, the diagnosis in his last days is a blow to Mr Clinton, who at the age of 54 will become on Saturday the country's youngest ex-president for a century. Speculation on his future continues to boil in Washington, where many pundits predict that he will try to maintain a political role, alongside his wife, Hillary, a newly-elected New York senator. Basal cell carcinomas account for three quarters of all skin cancers diagnosed annually. It is a slow-growing tumour on the surface of the skin and can be removed by a shallow incision. It does not enter the bloodstream and is therefore rarely fatal. It is much less dangerous than a melanoma of the kind which was recently found on Senator John McCain's skin. Basal cell carcinomas normally start as a white waxy scar, which can form scabs which alternately bleed and heal. Mr Siewert said the president would make a follow-up visit to the dermatologist in six months. \"If there's no evidence of new lesions at that time, it will be followed up on an annual basis,\" he said. Dr David Corbett, the retired chairman of the Bethesda naval hospital's dermatology department, said Mr Clinton had had \"sun-damage spots\" before, but this is the first time they raised suspicion of skin cancer. Meanwhile, Mr Clinton announced new measures, including $3.9m (\u00a32.4m) in grants, to help eliminate sweatshops and abusive child labour conditions around the world. He outlined the administration's newest efforts to fight child labour, including anti-sweatshop grants awarded to five NGOs and international organisations and the US agency for international development. In addition, the department of the treasury and customs service have prepared a document on forced child labour aimed at helping importers, manufactures and others to identify goods that may have been produced with forced or indentured child labour. \"Around the world, tens of millions of children are deprived of their childhood and subjected to the worst forms of child labour, slavery, forced or compulsory labour, prostitution, pornography and other kinds of harmful and unsafe work,\" Mr Clinton said. During a trip to Britain last month he addressed the issue of child labour and said rich countries should do more to end the practice. In 1999 Mr Clinton signed the child labour convention, an international treaty which seeks to spare children a life of misery as slaves, prostitutes, soldiers and indentured servants.",

It tells the story of Cecilia Roth's Manuela who, grief-stricken at the sudden death of her teenage son, moves from Madrid to Barcelona and discovers a new life caring for pregnant nun Rosa (Penelope Cruz) and veteran actress Huma (Marisa Paredes). Almod\u00f3var parades a colourful cast of larger-than-life characters, and events that allude cleverly to Hollywood classics All About Eve and A Streetcar Named Desire, but the effect is real and heartfelt: it was well worth its best foreign picture Oscar.",

He enjoyed oil painting, the opera, rambling, cooking, dining out and real ale. A dedicated and far-seeing educationist, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of East London. Yet the most lasting memory will surely be of Bernard the character, enlivening any occasion, leaving his mark on higher education - and in the myriad friendships he formed. He is survived by his wife Marilyn, from whom he was separated, his children, and Pam Hampshire, his partner for the last 15 years. \u0095 Bernard Alexander Corry, economist and teacher, born August 17 1930; died January 10 2001",

An agreement, which included a full apology, was made after the jury had been sworn in and high court proceedings, which had been expected to last three weeks, were about to begin. Mr White, 38, arrived at court wearing his trademark wide brimmed fedora. But moments after the case began, lawyers began to negotiate an agreement while Mr White and Mr Allen stood with their entourages at opposite ends of the corridor outside court 14. Their problems began in April 1998 when Mr Allan, 36, chairman of Fish Plc which supplies fish and meat to London's restaurants and owner of the Fish! chain of restaurants, gave an interview to the Mirror about his life and business. In a statement read after Judge Oliver Popplewell announced that the parties had agreed terms, James Price QC, for Mr White, outlined how Mr Allan alleged that he \"had served real ink to a customer in place of squid ink in a dish of braised cuttlefish in one of his restaurants,\" and added that Mr Allan now \"accepts that this story is untrue.\" In the article he also said that he had stopped supplying Mr White with fish because he had \"tried pulling the wool over his eyes\" in business dealings. Mr Price said that Mr Allan accepted that any suggestion that he had \"been dishonest in his business dealings ... or has otherwise behaved improperly in any way is also completely untrue.\" He added that Mr Allan accepted that he \"made an error in publishing and/or causing to be published these statements,\" withdrew the comments, and publicly apologised. He said Mr Allan had agreed to pay a \"very substantial\" sum of damages, believed to be more than \u00a3100,000, and legal costs estimated at \u00a31.5m. A statement from Mr White's spokesman said: \"The settlement of these proceedings will come as a great relief to my family, friends, co-directors and shareholders.\" The libel lawyer George Carman, who died earlier this month, was to have represented Mr White. He appeared for the chef in a successful libel action against the New York Times and International Herald Tribune last year. Mr White, the first British chef to be awarded three Michelin stars, and owner of restaurants including the Belvedere, Quo Vadis, and the Mirabelle, swept out of the court without comment. Mr Allan left court before the agreement was announced. His spokesman said he was on the way to Los Angeles to attend the premiere of the film Snatch .",

This demonstrates the Westminster adage that the best way to keep a secret is to make a speech about it. In my statement of January 9, I firstly identified the potential risks of DU. \"We have long recognised, however, that on the battlefield its debris might present a hazard from chemical toxicity, in the same way as any heavy metal, and a low-level radiological hazard.\" I pointed out that the Ministry of Defence has, in 1993 and 1999, published details of those hazards with our estimates of the risk they might have posed to troops in the Gulf. I added: \"Conscious of the potential risks that DU posed, we issued precautionary guidance to our forces in Kosovo about the need not to approach recently struck, burned-out armoured vehicles possibly hit by DU, which present the main hazard, and about the need to wear suitable protective clothing .\" Finally, we believe, on the basis of current scientific evidence, that there have been no ill health effects from DU, although we are working with our Nato allies to evaluate any new evidence. We recognise that the reporting of the issue will have caused concern. This is why we have announced a screening programme. John Spellar MP Minister of state for the armed forces",

What they do not have the right to do is to take the law into their own hands and to threaten or intimidate those people - the majority, as it happens - who do not share their views. Tony Blair rightly emphasised yesterday that activists should not be able to force legitimate research companies such as Huntingdon Life Science out of business, or put pressures on them to move abroad (which in any case will not solve the problem for the activists, but merely move it elsewhere). Mr Blair pointed out that this is a legitimate industry on which thousands of jobs depend. The government is also right to take a strong stand on the need for scientific research and the importance of keeping it in this country. The prime minister was speaking as demonstrators were continuing to protest outside branches of the Royal Bank of Scotland, whose subsidiary, NatWest, is negotiating an extension to a \u00a322.5m loan in order to fund HLS's research activities.</p> <p>Of course, in an ideal world, it would be nice not to experiment with animals. In an ideal world it might also also be nice not to kill animals to provide food. But in terms of practical living, experiments on animals are regarded by most people as an acceptable price to pay for curing illness and extending life itself. There are not many known cases of protestors refusing to take life-saving drugs resulting from experiments in the laboratory. Research on animals has already proved vital in making advances in treating cancer, heart problems, diabetes, lung diseases and Parkinson's. If every drug used in everyday life carried a label \"tested on animals\", it would bring home to people the importance of work like this. Researchers have to get permission to conduct experiments with animals, which have been taking place in this country under strict controls for over 70 years, with only occasional scandals. Mostly, these experiments involve very little, if any, pain because the subjects are \"sacrificed\" - to use scientists' favourite euphemism for death- before they have had a chance to suffer actual pain.</p> <p>HLS gets through about 75,000 animals a year, of which 87% are mice and rats, as a result of government legislation that requires every new medicine to be tested on rodents and on a non-rodent species before being given to humans. The deaths, though regrettable, must be set against the huge number of animals - from sheep to cats - in the world that would not exist at all but for the needs and activities of human beings. Domesticated animals outnumber animals in the wild by more than 10 to one. Some of them are then used to test medicines that enhance our lives and, quite often, the lives of animals themselves, including pets. It has to be admitted that the process involved is not particularly kind to animals; but neither is it inhumane, and the benefit to mankind far outweighs the damage caused by the means that inevitably have to be used.</p> <p>Official figures show that in 1999 there were 1,200 reports of animal rights attacks causing an estimated \u00a32.6m damage to property. The government is right to try to strengthen the law against the actions of maverick activists. As a nation, we accept that demonstrations against abuses of human rights should be peaceful and humane. Nothing less should be tolerated from animal rights protestors, who must expect the full weight of the law to be used against them if and when they choose to break it.</p>",

Tony Blair rightly emphasised yesterday that activists should not be able to force legitimate research companies such as Huntingdon Life Science out of business, or put pressures on them to move abroad (which in any case will not solve the problem for the activists, but merely move it elsewhere). Mr Blair pointed out that this is a legitimate industry on which thousands of jobs depend. The government is also right to take a strong stand on the need for scientific research and the importance of keeping it in this country. The prime minister was speaking as demonstrators were continuing to protest outside branches of the Royal Bank of Scotland, whose subsidiary, NatWest, is negotiating an extension to a \u00a322.5m loan in order to fund HLS's research activities. Of course, in an ideal world, it would be nice not to experiment with animals. In an ideal world it might also also be nice not to kill animals to provide food. But in terms of practical living, experiments on animals are regarded by most people as an acceptable price to pay for curing illness and extending life itself. There are not many known cases of protestors refusing to take life-saving drugs resulting from experiments in the laboratory. Research on animals has already proved vital in making advances in treating cancer, heart problems, diabetes, lung diseases and Parkinson's. If every drug used in everyday life carried a label \"tested on animals\", it would bring home to people the importance of work like this. Researchers have to get permission to conduct experiments with animals, which have been taking place in this country under strict controls for over 70 years, with only occasional scandals. Mostly, these experiments involve very little, if any, pain because the subjects are \"sacrificed\" - to use scientists' favourite euphemism for death- before they have had a chance to suffer actual pain. HLS gets through about 75,000 animals a year, of which 87% are mice and rats, as a result of government legislation that requires every new medicine to be tested on rodents and on a non-rodent species before being given to humans. The deaths, though regrettable, must be set against the huge number of animals - from sheep to cats - in the world that would not exist at all but for the needs and activities of human beings. Domesticated animals outnumber animals in the wild by more than 10 to one. Some of them are then used to test medicines that enhance our lives and, quite often, the lives of animals themselves, including pets. It has to be admitted that the process involved is not particularly kind to animals; but neither is it inhumane, and the benefit to mankind far outweighs the damage caused by the means that inevitably have to be used. Official figures show that in 1999 there were 1,200 reports of animal rights attacks causing an estimated \u00a32.6m damage to property. The government is right to try to strengthen the law against the actions of maverick activists. As a nation, we accept that demonstrations against abuses of human rights should be peaceful and humane. Nothing less should be tolerated from animal rights protestors, who must expect the full weight of the law to be used against them if and when they choose to break it.",

      "bodyText": "A prison officer attacked an inmate and other officers then tried to intimidate him into withdrawing his complaint, according to allegations being investigated by the Metropolitan police. Steven Graham alleges that he was warned to drop his claim that a prison officer at Wandsworth jail in south London had assaulted him and that his \"life would be made hell\" if he did not. Three officers deny the allegations. Six men are to sue the prison service over alleged beatings by Wandsworth prison officers, a joint Guardian/BBC Newsnight investigation has learned. One says his beating was so severe he suffered a fractured jaw. The two assaults Graham says he suffered came after a damning report in June 1999 by the chief inspector of prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham, who found that prison officers at the jail ruled by fear and had a \"culture of intimidation\". A file on Graham's alleg ations has been sent to the crown prosecution service by detectives. Three prison officers at the centre of the allegations have been suspended and interviewed under criminal caution by the police. Graham, 27, who was serving a sentence for causing actual bodily harm, says he was first attacked on March 13, 2000, in his cell. The alleged attack left him with a fractured nose. The next day Graham complained about the alleged assault. On March 16, Graham alleges that another officer told him to \"retract that statement or your life's going to be made hell in here\". He says officers pressured him to withdraw the complaint on two further occasions. On May 2 Graham was interviewed by the police over his allegations. Three days later Graham claims he was assaulted a second time in his cell by an officer. Graham, who has been moved out of Wandsworth, says that he was unable to walk for a short period after the second attack. Another inmate, who asked not to be named, said his jaw was fractured by prison officers in June 1998. The inmate, jailed for theft, said that after he complained about not receiving his mail or newspapers, he was attacked in his cell: \"A number of officers arrived and told my cell mate to get out ... [An officer] punched me in the chest or stomach and blew his whistle. Loads of other officers came in. I threw myself on the bed and all the other officers started punching and kicking me.

      "bodyText": "Given the rise of the \"knowledge economy\" and the exorcism of hierarchy from companies, the days when who you knew was more important than what you knew are long gone. The new economy is open, fluid and meritocratic, constantly circulating its elites. No one is bounded by his or her social class or background. Or not. Social mobility, on some measures, has actually declined. Of course, lots of people with working class parents have become middle class themselves - Frasier mobility - but that is only because the middle class has grown, creating \"more room at the top\". But the differential chances of people with middle-class and working-class backgrounds has not altered one jot in recent decades.

These are always an excuse for a company to put on its jewels and ruffle its tail feathers, but unfortunately ENB didn't have a reliably glitzy reserve of talent to call upon and the party never quite took off. Fernanda and Alexis Oliveira (not related) looked morosely overawed by Swan Lake's Act Two pas de deux, while Yat Sen Chang and Monica Perego slammed through the technical tricks of the Don Q pas de deux with formidable energy but little charm. </p> <p>Fortunately Yosvani Ramos, the company's emerging star, proved to be the benchmark by which the others failed, dancing the Corsaire pas de deux with an intelligence and fluency that brought music and fresh air to its familiar gymnastics. Fortunately, too, ENB's lead couple, Thomas Edur and Agnes Oaks, were on hand to perform Impromptu, Derek Deane's romantic duet. Though Deane's choreography suffers, as always, from a cramped surfeit of steps and a shamelessly light-fingered approach to other people's ideas, the duet still functions as a flattering showcase for Oaks and Edur's flawlessly lyrical double act. </p> <p>It's a shame the pair weren't cast to dance Etudes, a ballet whose main aim is to knock the audience sideways with the splendour of its dancing. Splendour was not the word conjured by these labours - despite Perego flaunting more of her crisis-proof technique. The main pleasure of the piece was spotting Alice Crawford in her two-minute spot in the Sylph section, dancing with a musicality and style that not only eluded others in the Etudes cast but, more damagingly, was absent from the company's performance of Les Sylphides. </p> <p>ENB has always taken the ballet at a slow tempo but this performance nearly ground to a halt through a combination of laboured conducting and dancing that straggled through a fog of tired indifference. Erina Takahashi, dancing the Prelude, came closest to capturing the ballet's elusive gleam, but many of the dancers seemed to be ignoring Chopin's accompanying music and the dreamy poetry of the choreography. </p> <p>It was, frankly, a dog of a night for ENB, but then all companies have them.

      "body": "<p>If Aristotle Ran General Motors is a great title for a book. It also sounds like a pretty decent idea, and one that might have staved off the recent 15,000 redundancies and 25,000 lay-offs at the US car giant. A board of Greek philosophers might have been a little more stoical in the face of recession than the current team. </p> <p>In truth, Tom Morris's book - one of a batch that promise to apply the teachings of great thinkers to the workplace - doesn't quite deliver. The style is too folksy, the acceptance that business is per se good too unquestioning (what about If Karl Marx Ran General Motors?), and the obsession with golf irritating.</p> <p> The central message of Morris's book, however, is an attractive one: employees matter; they are the core of any business; they animate its spirit and communicate its message. We work long hours, and we should enjoy it; we should understand and be part of the firm's spirit - know not only what it does but what it is. </p> <p>This is where Aristotle (384-322BC) comes in. He wrote for the Greek city state, and firms like General Motors are the modern equivalent - large bodies of people who need to be animated by a common aim, given an identity, a mission statement. Morris, a former professor of philosophy, was brought up as a Baptist, and religion inflects much of the book. </p> <p>\"In business, as well as in all the professions, and in fact throughout our entire culture,\" he writes, \"we face a spiritual crisis.\" Morris's - and, by implication, Aristotle's - answer can be summed up in four words: Truth, Beauty, Goodness, Unity. Let those concepts underpin your business and you will have a happy workforce, a satisfied customer base and a healthy share price. God and Mammon will walk hand in hand. Hallelujah. </p> <p>Morris believes that business should be a beautiful and edifying thing. He extends Aristotle's definition of the city - \"a partnership for living well\" - to commercial organisations. \"The vast, complex array of modern activities known generically as 'business' have something important in common. They are all activities creating, maintaining and altering structures within which people can enter into partnerships for living well. They ideally contribute to the world structures within which we can grow, develop and provide for both ourselves and others what is needed for living well.\" </p> <p>Morris is, as you will have noticed, extremely optimistic about what businesses can achieve. Just as Aristotle didn't question slavery or the second-class status of women, so Morris thinks existing structures can be made to work if they are given a moral and spiritual dimension. All General Motors and the rest of America's business behemoths need is \"creative love\", a concept at the centre of Morris's Aristotelian world-view. </p> <p>\"The meaning of life is creative love,\" says Morris, admirably willing to tackle the big issues. \"Not love as an inner feeling, as a private sentimental emotion, but love as a dynamic power moving out into the world and doing something original ... What are you doing? What are you building? Where is your art? What are you creating, day to day? Is your life guided by creative love? In doing your work, are you somehow involved in acts of loving creativity?\" Well, are you ? </p> <p>You probably hate all this motivational stuff, but I rather like it. I once heard a middle-aged businessman in a posh pub suddenly declare, \"To cease to strive is to begin to die,\" and it struck a chord. To adapt Gibbon, individuals, like empires, can never stand still: they either go forward or back. Businesses too. All are organisms that can grow or decline, live or die. They will collapse unless they can establish a rationale, a style, a philosophy. What are they? What are their aims? How do they express themselves to the rest of the world? </p> <p>The Post Office was mocked when it unveiled its new identity last week, and the name does seem absurd, but if this type of corporate revamp is done properly, it is not the identity which emerges at the end of the process that is important but the self-analysis that takes place within the organisation to arrive at that identity. The logo merely embodies the personality that an act of corporate therapy is supposed to uncover. Consignia is a terrible name, but something may be salvaged if the act of rebranding has led to a culture shift at the Post Office. I can see you are not convinced. </p> <p>Morris is by no means alone in attempting to harness the help of philosophers in the quest to improve the performance of businesses. Machiavelli has long been a popular philosopher for writers of business guides (Anthony Jay got in first with Management and Machiavelli in 1967), but not for the reasons you might think. Machiavelli does not deserve the adjective \"machiavellian\"; the pejorative overtones came later. \"There is no evidence to suggest that Machiavelli was himself an evil man,\" says Alistair McAlpine in The New Machiavelli, a clever rewriting of The Prince for a business audience. </p> <p>\"However, he clearly understood the capacity for evil that lurks in all of us. The point is not that Machiavelli advocated evil-doing; rather that he accepted that all human activity, and especially politics, will involve evil-doing. Having acknowledged that evil is unavoidable, Machiavelli tries to show his prince how to recognise it for what it is and how to use it to his own advantage.\" </p> <p>McAlpine's book is full of precepts for business people. Take the need for certainty: \"The good and successful employer must manage with certainty, a certainty that instructions will be obeyed, and a certainty that those instructions are the right instructions. In the world of business there must be no room for doubt; each problem must be approached with the attitude of no compromise. Never must an employee or opponent be aware that you have a fall-back position prepared, though this will in all probability be the case. Certainty is the style that the employer must communicate to all employees.\" Tough, tough, tough. </p> <p>Less tough is McAlpine/Machiavelli's view, echoing Morris/Aristotle, of the need for \"respect\" in business. \"Good employers must see to it that respect is practised among their employees, and strive to make their businesses into grander things than just vehicles for making money. Business must be conducted with honour and efficiency. Fairness must be maintained at all levels in a business.\" You see: Machiavelli wouldn't be so bad as chief exec. </p> <p>McAlpine has also contributed an essay, \"Renaissance realpolitik for modern management\", to a diffuse collection called Machiavelli, Marketing and Management which tries, none too successfully, to be historical textbook, politics primer and business guide. Again, the emphasis McAlpine places on the non-machiavellian side of Machiavelli is attractive. \"Success without honour is worthless; deceit is the currency of failure. Honour and morality are two of the touchstones of success: without these two, success is a poor thing.\" </p> <p>McAlpine, in fact, admits to going further than Machiavelli and believing that success is not real \"unless it is achieved with honour and maintained with morality and charity\". (I'm not sure how McAlpine squares this warm - he calls it \"romantic\" - view of human nature and business practice with his unwavering faith in Thatcherism.) </p> <p>Business writers are also looking elsewhere for inspiration. There have been two recent books seeking to draw leadership lessons from Shakespeare's plays. To precis: suffer fools gladly, utilise the wild ideas of Falstaffian mavericks, don't think you have a divine right to lead, and be decisive (unlike you know who). </p> <p>History, too, is providing ammo for the corporate gurus. Alan Axelrod, author of Patton on Leadership, has now turned his attention to one of England's most Pattonish monarchs in Elizabeth I, CEO: Strategic Lessons in Leadership from the Woman Who Built an Empire. I am myself considering writing a slim but lucrative guide called Business for Barbarians: The Attila the Hun Action Plan. </p> <p>Much of this is bandwagoning, and the attractions of trying to emulate the great leader, bottle his or her unquenchable drive and desire, are obvious. But the trend towards co-opting philosophers and thinkers is more interesting - and more encouraging. Work is at the centre of an individual's life, commerce at the core of a society; both can be soulless, mechanical, demeaning, ultimately destructive. </p> <p>For all its complacency, Morris's book does attempt to humanise corporate life by making respect, dignity and truth the touchstones of good business practice, and putting people - employees and customers - before profits (the latter, he implies, will follow ineluctably once corporate happiness has been achieved). </p> <p>So Aristotle as chairman, Machiavelli as CEO and Shakespeare as head of communications. I think we can face the future with confidence.

Dressed in a black suit and shirt, leaning sideways into a casually held microphone, Philippe looks frighteningly like a teacher encouraged by mischievous pupils to do his Sacha Distel impression. Usually the kids snigger and point; tonight the crowd just smile. A lot. Philippe's sunny melodies make it difficult not to, his polite Gallic charm adding to the cosy atmosphere. </p> <p>He's an old hand at this music malarkey, having spent 15 years arranging and singing delicate songs that exist despite of, and outside of, contemporary tastes. Mixing country guitars with Burt Bacharach tunes, jazz rhythms with French lyrics, Philippe has a unique vision: as long as it's subtle and melodious, anything goes. On his latest album Azure, it's the use of strings that draws the listener into his idyllic world, but he easily translates his melancholy tales to a pared-down line-up of bass, guitars and keyboards, without losing any of the charm and sincerity of the songs. </p> <p>\"This is a little French song,\" he says, introducing Martine, which is just that. Immediately visions of Grace Kelly in an open-topped car cruising the 1950s Riviera are brought to life, the soft vocals and simple rhythm as seamless and luxurious as the Chanel clothes she doubtless would be wearing. </p> <p>Philippe brings us back down to earth with When Georgie Died. \"This,\" he tells us, \"is about a Manchester United player, George Best.\" The song kills the glamorous side of things, but also reveals how much Philippe has in common with songwriter Jimmy Webb, constructing haunting moments of beauty, the melody eclipsing the sadness of the lyrics. It's a Glenn Campbell moment. </p> <p>But it's when tackling the genius of Brian Wilson, and acknowledging stage fright \"at entering such well-charted territory\", that Philippe really shines. I Just Wasn't Made For These Times sits so easily against his own work that Wilson suddenly seems not so much an inspiration as a mentor. The way Philippe's voice blends with those of his band - including longtime collaborator Danny Manners - is giddyingly lovely, despite recalling an unsettling memory of the Flying Pickets. </p> <p>Jackie Girl has Philippe getting funkier, with 1960s garage basslines and shuffling jazz drums, but essentially he is content to sing his stuff without breaking into a sweat, happily watching lead guitarist Dave Gregory for most of the night. And while the music Philippe offers is a treat, it's one best enjoyed at home, because on stage he resembles a slick hotel bar crooner a little too closely for comfort.</p>",

Philippe brings us back down to earth with When Georgie Died. \"This,\" he tells us, \"is about a Manchester United player, George Best.\" The song kills the glamorous side of things, but also reveals how much Philippe has in common with songwriter Jimmy Webb, constructing haunting moments of beauty, the melody eclipsing the sadness of the lyrics. It's a Glenn Campbell moment. But it's when tackling the genius of Brian Wilson, and acknowledging stage fright \"at entering such well-charted territory\", that Philippe really shines. I Just Wasn't Made For These Times sits so easily against his own work that Wilson suddenly seems not so much an inspiration as a mentor. The way Philippe's voice blends with those of his band - including longtime collaborator Danny Manners - is giddyingly lovely, despite recalling an unsettling memory of the Flying Pickets. Jackie Girl has Philippe getting funkier, with 1960s garage basslines and shuffling jazz drums, but essentially he is content to sing his stuff without breaking into a sweat, happily watching lead guitarist Dave Gregory for most of the night. And while the music Philippe offers is a treat, it's one best enjoyed at home, because on stage he resembles a slick hotel bar crooner a little too closely for comfort.",

Less Than Zero by Bret Easton Ellis</strong><br>People lump Ellis in with McInerney, but he's a much more sophisticated writer. So many writers I know started thinking seriously about writing after reading Ellis.</p> <p><strong>2. Bright Young Things by Scarlett Thomas</strong><br>Due out later this year, Scarlett Thomas's novel absolutely defines a particular moment in time - by isolating her characters on an island and turning them inside out. Packed full of pop-references, this is a very entertaining read.</p> <p><strong>3. Coast by Matthew Branton</strong><br>It can be frustrating trying to explain to someone why certain books are so good. Coast knocked me sideways and of all the books on this list, this is the one I'd tell everyone to read.</p> <p><strong>4. A Certain Age by Rebecca Ray</strong><br>I first read Ray's novel two years ago. At the time I loved the book's simplicity and honesty, but had no idea how often I would find scenes haunting my memory.</p> <p><strong>5. The Beach by Alex Garland</strong><br>The first English novel in ages to thrill through story, a beautifully constructed novel that will still be read and enjoyed in a hundred years time.</p> <p><strong>6. Eight Minutes Idle by Matt Thorne</strong><br>I know I shouldn't put myself on this list, but it is supposed to be a top ten New Puritans list, right? If I had to be judged on anything I've written, this would be the one I'd like taken into account.</p> <p><strong>7. The Dope Priest by Nicholas Blincoe</strong><br>My co-editor's best book, and the one that seems most New Puritan, although I believe his next novel White Mice is going to be written entirely according to New Puritan rules.</p> <p><strong>8. The Royal Family by William T Vollmann</strong><br>Reading this novel earlier this year, I was struck how a lot of formerly postmodernist novelists have been returning to realism, with stunning results. This account of San Francisco prostitution pretty much follows all the New Puritan rules.</p> <p><strong>9. Corpsing by Toby Litt</strong><br>Litt's second novel was a mainstream success. As with The Beach, Toby Litt utilises his story-telling skills to create incredible excitement.</p> <p><strong>10. A Sweetheart Deal by Ben Richards</strong><br>Richards, our most reluctant New Puritan, wishes to reserve the right to use poetic prose. Fair enough. The New Puritan project was intended as one-off, a way of bringing writers together and getting them to do something different, not restrict them for life. Richards is a writer I've admired for ages, and this is his best book.</p>",

Packed full of pop-references, this is a very entertaining read. 3. Coast by Matthew Branton It can be frustrating trying to explain to someone why certain books are so good. Coast knocked me sideways and of all the books on this list, this is the one I'd tell everyone to read. 4. A Certain Age by Rebecca Ray I first read Ray's novel two years ago. At the time I loved the book's simplicity and honesty, but had no idea how often I would find scenes haunting my memory. 5. The Beach by Alex Garland The first English novel in ages to thrill through story, a beautifully constructed novel that will still be read and enjoyed in a hundred years time. 6. Eight Minutes Idle by Matt Thorne I know I shouldn't put myself on this list, but it is supposed to be a top ten New Puritans list, right? If I had to be judged on anything I've written, this would be the one I'd like taken into account. 7. The Dope Priest by Nicholas Blincoe My co-editor's best book, and the one that seems most New Puritan, although I believe his next novel White Mice is going to be written entirely according to New Puritan rules. 8. The Royal Family by William T Vollmann Reading this novel earlier this year, I was struck how a lot of formerly postmodernist novelists have been returning to realism, with stunning results. This account of San Francisco prostitution pretty much follows all the New Puritan rules. 9. Corpsing by Toby Litt Litt's second novel was a mainstream success. As with The Beach, Toby Litt utilises his story-telling skills to create incredible excitement. 10. A Sweetheart Deal by Ben Richards Richards, our most reluctant New Puritan, wishes to reserve the right to use poetic prose. Fair enough. The New Puritan project was intended as one-off, a way of bringing writers together and getting them to do something different, not restrict them for life. Richards is a writer I've admired for ages, and this is his best book.",

There's a rumour going round that only his first dozen or so stories are the jewels. I thought this myself, until this giant cartography came out. All through his career, Borges was capable of mining a deep seam. Dark sparkles of narrative, magic charms. I see it as a vast storehouse of ideas, the best ideas ever. I mean that. Ain't nobody coming near.</p> <p><strong>2. The Annotated Alice by Lewis Carroll, edited by Martin Gardner</strong><br>Two nightmare destinations. Wonderland and Looking Glass. The more I read these books, the darker they shine. Gardner picks at the invocation, without breaking the spell. They're stuff in here you don't even know about, nobody does. Carroll operates on language like a cruel, crazy surgeon. Beyond the wordplay, check out Alice's own explanation of the Jabberwocky poem: \"Somebody killed something.\" Scary stuff.</p> <p><strong>3. Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid by Douglas R Hofstadter</strong><br>A complex, ticking bomb. This is easily the most difficult book I've ever read. It took me four goes, starting from the beginning each time, and it's 750 pages, just to explain Godel's Theory of Incompleteness. Along the way Hofstadter takes in all human knowledge systems, including Lewis Carroll. Still not sure what it's all about, but that's beside the point. Again, ideas abound. There are passages in here, without which, Vurt would not exist.</p> <p><strong>4. Digital Leatherette by Steve Beard</strong><br>A novel. The word hardly contains the book. A narrative of sorts, all told through the fragments gathered from imaginary websites. Hardcore, fiercely committed, living by its own code, more than a little melancholic. When technology learns how to dream, this is what the English machines will wake up from, shaking their foggy terminals. Stick with it, there are delights to uncover.</p> <p><strong>5. House of Leaves by Mark Z. Danielewski</strong><br>When I first saw this, pardon me, but I just thought, \"Shit, the bastard!\" It's got the lot, including stuff that shouldn't really be in a novel. One of those books that makes up its own rules as it goes along. Also, it's a book that eats itself. It gorges on its own imaginative powers. In a slightly different universe (and country), I'd be writing a book like this. Perhaps I will, one day.</p> <p><strong>6. Rock Springs by Richard Ford</strong><br>This is where I go when I just want some pure storytelling thrills. Ford writes a lovely sentence, and he piles them up to produce plots that never really close, so there's no sense of being manipulated. Glinting American prose, with a hard-bitten romanticism shot through. Losers predominate, searching for a way out.</p> <p><strong>7. The Age of Wire and String by Ben Marcus</strong><br>Like House of Leaves, this is another American book that filled me with envy. House was over a 1000 pages; this does the same but in 139 pages. It's a description of various objects, all seen in a unique light, with a kind of hidden narrative connecting them all. A bit confusing at first, until you give yourself up to the mood, then strangely addictive. Very, very powerful imagination at work here.</p> <p><strong>8. The Ring of Brightest Angels Around Heaven by Rick Moody</strong><br>A recent discovery. I want to read everything this guy has done. He writes stories set in the worst excesses of human life, a lot of stuff about junkies and S&amp;M addicts. And yet, out of the hideousness, the desperation, Moody manages to forge some astonishing moments of beauty. Great freewheeling rock and roll prose style filled with sentences I wish I'd written.</p> <p><strong>9. Collected Poems by Sylvia Plath</strong><br>Never trust a writer who tells you they don't like poetry. It's like an oil painter saying he doesn't like paint. Plath has the intense love of language that I'm always searching for. I like work that belongs to one writer alone, and this is Plath's own, very personal realm, illuminated by her own personal language. Painful, truthful, magical and filled with riddles.</p> <p><strong>10. A Humument by Tom Phillips</strong><br>A favourite, and a big influence, especially on Cobralingus. Phillips is a visual artist. Here, he's treated an obscure Victorian novel called A Human Document. He's painted over every single page, with a different design on every page, but leaving words showing through here and there. All that's left of the first page is this: \"The following sing I, a book, a book of art, of mind and art. That which he hid, reveal I.\" These words tell a fragmented story, and the page designs comment on this. A box of treasures, with many secret compartments.</p>",
