All the fuss was about goals galore; once again Eriksson left wondering whether they were a Mackem myth. </p> <p>\"I feel sorry for Kevin,\" said Niall Quinn, whose telepathic strike partnership with the 27-year-old has been the source of so many of Phillips' 104 Sunderland goals in 145 appearances. \"Mr Eriksson came to watch him again and yet the Bradford game was probably one of the most difficult matches in which Kev has played. </p> <p>\"He hasn't seen him in one or two of our other recent games where Kevin has been outstanding.

After a slow start, Clinton left office with an environmental record unrivalled since Theodore Roosevelt set up America's national parks.

The president-elect,\" he said testily last week.</p> <p>To win public support for exploiting the spectacular Arctic coastal plain, home to teeming hordes of polar bear and caribou, Bush has carefully presented his environmental policies within a wider energy and national security context.

      "body": "<p>Last week a writer in the Daily Mail decried football's encroachment into every aspect of British life, saying that nowadays a politician would rather confess to tucking his shirt into his underpants than to not liking the game. You can take the point. No one likes to see MPs struggling to give themselves the illusion of three dimensions by listing the players they idolised in their youth, or, in the case of Tony Blair, by recalling watching players who had retired before they were weaned. (Perhaps, like Woody Allen, the prime minister once suffered a near-death experience in which someone else's life flashed before his eyes.) And yet while football may appear ubiquitous, in some ways it also remains invisible. Or at least its history does. </p> <p>On Saturday I walked down the evocatively named Third Avenue in Ashington, Northumberland, past thoroughfares named after Shakespearean heroines - Juliet, Portia, Katharine - until I came to Beatrice Street, two long rows of brick terrace houses facing each other across tiny front gardens and a narrow pavement. </p> <p>Some of the plots are neatly tended, the shoots of snowdrops gingerly peeping up from the soil, others are a dumping ground for mouldering off-cuts of nylon carpet and the limbless torsos of discarded dolls. Certainly Beatrice Street is nothing to write home about - unless your spouse happens to be scouting locations for a remake of Saturday Night And Sunday Morning, that is - but in a land where football is apparently omnipresent you might expect it to be marked in some way. After all, this was where Jack and Bobby Charlton were brought up by their indomitable mother Cissie and their father Bob, a quiet, tough man who won the money to pay for the wedding ring in the boxing booth at a local fair. </p> <p>At the top of the street is Hirst North Junior School where Bobby won his first championship, the East Northumberland Boys League, at the back the alleyway where the brothers were traditionally photographed in later life kicking a ball about with local youngsters. But though Bobby has some legitimate claim to be the most famous Englishman of the latter half of the 20th century, Beatrice Street does not have a plaque or a sign. </p> <p>To find out about the local football heritage you have to go along to Portland Park, home of Ashington FC. Contrary to what the marketing people might choose to believe, football does not have a home. The game is itinerant and there is plenty of evidence in the Colliers' clubhouse that it has occasionally pitched its tent in Ashington. Photos of the town's famous players line the walls. Many of them are Charlton relatives. </p> <p>Cissie's father \"Tanner\" Milburn was Ashington's goalkeeper during their brief spell in the Football League. Her four brothers all played professionally: Jack, George and Jim for Leeds, Stan for Leicester; her cousin was \"Wor Jackie\" Milburn; another set of cousins, the Cobbledicks, wisely stayed away from the football field. </p> <p>Cissie brought Bobby to Portland Park when he was a baby. The shouting of the crowd startled him and he burst into tears and wailed so loudly she had to take him home again. On Saturday the roar produced by the 80 or so diehards was less alarming; Ashington, pushing for promotion in Albany Northern League Division Two, thrashed Norton and Stockton Ancients 5-0. When the fourth goal went in, the visitors' manager sidled over to a man standing by the floodlight pylon and inquired wearily \"Have you got the petrol money?\" </p> <p>Afterwards, the two teams sat at long tables in the clubhouse function room eating the fish and chips an Ashington committee member had brought in a few minutes earlier in a large cardboard box. On the wall by the telephone a photo shows Jack tangling with a Celtic forward at Hampden Park in the semi-final of the 1970 European Cup. The terraces beyond him are packed so tightly just looking at it sends a shiver down your spine. </p> <p>Ashington council have discussed the founding of a football museum and if the club ever build a new stadium there is talk of incorporating one into it. If any of the town's footballing sons had been writers, artists or politicians, though, it seems certain they would have been commemorated by now. Perhaps this is as it should be a true reflection of the game's value. The fact remains, however, that when you get in a taxi in Gdansk or Dar es Salaam, it is very unlikely that when the driver realises you are English he will turn around, smile and say: \"Anthony Trollope!\" </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

On Saturday I walked down the evocatively named Third Avenue in Ashington, Northumberland, past thoroughfares named after Shakespearean heroines - Juliet, Portia, Katharine - until I came to Beatrice Street, two long rows of brick terrace houses facing each other across tiny front gardens and a narrow pavement. Some of the plots are neatly tended, the shoots of snowdrops gingerly peeping up from the soil, others are a dumping ground for mouldering off-cuts of nylon carpet and the limbless torsos of discarded dolls. Certainly Beatrice Street is nothing to write home about - unless your spouse happens to be scouting locations for a remake of Saturday Night And Sunday Morning, that is - but in a land where football is apparently omnipresent you might expect it to be marked in some way. After all, this was where Jack and Bobby Charlton were brought up by their indomitable mother Cissie and their father Bob, a quiet, tough man who won the money to pay for the wedding ring in the boxing booth at a local fair. At the top of the street is Hirst North Junior School where Bobby won his first championship, the East Northumberland Boys League, at the back the alleyway where the brothers were traditionally photographed in later life kicking a ball about with local youngsters. But though Bobby has some legitimate claim to be the most famous Englishman of the latter half of the 20th century, Beatrice Street does not have a plaque or a sign. To find out about the local football heritage you have to go along to Portland Park, home of Ashington FC. Contrary to what the marketing people might choose to believe, football does not have a home. The game is itinerant and there is plenty of evidence in the Colliers' clubhouse that it has occasionally pitched its tent in Ashington. Photos of the town's famous players line the walls. Many of them are Charlton relatives. Cissie's father \"Tanner\" Milburn was Ashington's goalkeeper during their brief spell in the Football League. Her four brothers all played professionally: Jack, George and Jim for Leeds, Stan for Leicester; her cousin was \"Wor Jackie\" Milburn; another set of cousins, the Cobbledicks, wisely stayed away from the football field. Cissie brought Bobby to Portland Park when he was a baby. The shouting of the crowd startled him and he burst into tears and wailed so loudly she had to take him home again. On Saturday the roar produced by the 80 or so diehards was less alarming; Ashington, pushing for promotion in Albany Northern League Division Two, thrashed Norton and Stockton Ancients 5-0. When the fourth goal went in, the visitors' manager sidled over to a man standing by the floodlight pylon and inquired wearily \"Have you got the petrol money?\" Afterwards, the two teams sat at long tables in the clubhouse function room eating the fish and chips an Ashington committee member had brought in a few minutes earlier in a large cardboard box. On the wall by the telephone a photo shows Jack tangling with a Celtic forward at Hampden Park in the semi-final of the 1970 European Cup. The terraces beyond him are packed so tightly just looking at it sends a shiver down your spine. Ashington council have discussed the founding of a football museum and if the club ever build a new stadium there is talk of incorporating one into it. If any of the town's footballing sons had been writers, artists or politicians, though, it seems certain they would have been commemorated by now. Perhaps this is as it should be a true reflection of the game's value. The fact remains, however, that when you get in a taxi in Gdansk or Dar es Salaam, it is very unlikely that when the driver realises you are English he will turn around, smile and say: \"Anthony Trollope!\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

I was performing in New York doing The Doll's House, and this was in the middle of the women's liberation in the 70s in the United States. Can I just tell you this story first?</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Er... yes.</p> <p> <strong>LU:</strong> I was doing it with Sam Waterston. I was Nora and he was Helmer. Sam always played the nice guy. And this was women's liberation. We did the rehearsals and Sam was very happy and I was happy and then we had the audience there for the first time two days before the premiere. They started booing when Helmer, my husband, came in. Each time I said something it was, \"Oh, wonderful! Wonderful!\" Anything I said! When he said something it was, \"Boo!\" It was terrible. And in the end, when I left the stage, they applauded, and he had one line, \"I don't understand\", and they really booed him.</p> <p>Sam was so shaken afterwards he almost didn't want to do it anymore. So to pep him up I said we should do yoga before. So the day before the premiere we did some yoga and Sam stretched his toe a little, so he had to go onstage with a stick. And, you know, they really didn't boo because he had this stick. They still said, \"Bravo! Bravo!\" when Nora said something, but they were much more quiet. And when I left the stage they kind of felt sorry because he was sitting there with a stick.</p> <p>Now this is the honest-to-God truth I am telling you. The next day was the premiere. Sam Waterston came in on crutches. He did the whole run on crutches and nobody applauded when I left anymore. It was a success and it was a new way of doing the play.</p> <p>So Ingmar wanted to come to the United States to see this. But he is very isolated. Woody Allen kept inviting me out for dinner because he admired Ingmar so much. References to Ingmar all the time. </p> <p> So I told him that Ingmar was coming to town. Woody said, \"Aaah! Can I meet him? I can't believe it.\" So I called Ingmar and said that Woody Allen wanted to meet him, and he said, \"That would be a pleasure.\"</p> <p>So Ingmar came for two days only and on one day he would see the play and the next day he would have dinner in his hotel suite because, you know, he is a genius and so he doesn't go on the streets and thing... So we would have dinner with Woody in his suite. So Woody collected me from the theatre the second day in a limo with a chauffeur who wore white gloves who you couldn't address - he's also a kind of genius! So we sat in this limo and Woody was so nervous. We got to the suite and the door opens. The two look at each other. You should have seen their eyes: they just looked at each other. \"Hello.\" \"Hello.\" And that was the only thing the two of them said, hello hello. That is true.</p> <p>So we sat down at the dinner table and they didn't talk to each other! And Ingrid, who is Ingmar's wife, who is not normally allowed to talk when there are artists there, she was talking!</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> But you have a bit of a problem with Ingrid...</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> We didn't have that contact, we didn't share that much... but... you know, she's a great cook! So we talked about the meatballs! This is really true. And when we said something really silly, the two geniuses would look at each other and, you know, think, \"Hmm. Little women.\" You know. </p> <p>And for dessert, to put hurt upon hurt, she had an envelope with my child support - I got $1,500 a year in child support - and she gave that envelope to me over the table. So it was a strange dinner. And then it was over, and I'm not even sure they said goodbye. They kind of looked at each other with this knowing smile. Then I went back with Woody in his limo and he said, \"Thank you Liv. That was an experience.\" </p> <p>Ingmar then called me when I got back to my room and said, \"Thank you Liv. He is really special.\" They didn't say a word to each other the whole dinner.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Let's open it up to some questions from the audience.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What recent films have you seen that you liked?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> I get all these movies that are nominated for Oscars and I see them on tapes which really is not how you should see them. I saw Hitching Dragon... Flying What... That one by Ang Lee. I thought that was fantastic. I don't know about the story, but the images and these people fighting but flowing through the air... I thought that was fantastic. And I saw another movie, the script was not so good, but I saw an actress I have admired for some years, Cate Blanchett. She is doing such an extraordinary performance in a movie that perhaps isn't the best. She is really, apart from Lena Endre, she is really... well she is younger than Lena, so I would say she is the best actor of her generation and Lena Endre of hers. It is very difficult if you are an actress to be good in a bad film, but she manages that.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Would you consider working with international stars like that, or is it important for you to work within Scandinavia?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> No. It is important for me to work with something that is close to my heart, and it doesn't matter to me what language they speak. Cate Blanchett, she is a soul mate, I can see. Languages are no problem, but it would be a problem if it was a Hollywood film because you don't get the last edit, and you can't have people editing your film. They haven't asked me either.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why isn't there a Bergman retrospective at the NFT so young people can see Bergman, and what was it like acting with Ingrid Bergman.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> I'll answer the first part. Bergman prints are very hard to get hold of. Even to get the extracts we showed tonight. </p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> I did hear that there may be a retrospective here. Maybe people could demand it. Working with Ingrid was an incredible joy. I admire her so much. What was good with her was that she was so honest, she came out with everything she felt, and that is sometimes difficult if you work with somebody like Ingmar. You respect him so much, and I'm using this word genius, and I mean it from my heart, but sometimes I am also using it in a special way... to explain... Ingrid was important because she did not qualify him as anything other than a director. I used to sit there and admire her, that she said everything that she did. We played a mother and a daughter, and we said to Ingmar, \"Why are you making the mother so unsympathetic, just because she also wants to have a career. Can we change the words?\" And Ingmar said, \"No, you cannot change the words.\" We said, \"Can we play against the character?\" And he said, \"Yes, you are actresses, you can do that.\"</p> <p>Then there was this incredible episode happening when we did Autumn Sonata. I am the daughter and I am blaming my mother for everything I am in life. I am more than 40 years old, and there comes a time when you cannot blame your mother anymore. Somehow you are living your own life. But she goes on blaming her mother. So it is this scene where the mother is blaming her daughter and I had three pages of a monologue telling the mother how terrible she'd been, look at the misery of my life and it's all your fault. I go on and on and on through a whole night. And in the morning, Ingrid Bergman, as the mother, has two lines. \"Please, hold me. Please, love me.\" And I thought that was beautiful. If I had to do that, I would really make people cry, I would do it tenderly.</p> <p>So I did all my lines, and Ingrid just sat there, and I did the hate and the anger and everything. The camera was turned on to Ingrid and she was to say, \"Please, hold me. Please, love me.\" But she says, \"No! I'm not going to say that. I want to slap her in the face and leave the room.\" And it was incredible - no one has talked to him in that way. He was red and he said, \"That is your line.\" \"I'm not doing it.\" So they started to yell and went out of the studio. We all looked at each other and thought, \"The movie is going to end here.\" We heard the voices out there, really high voices - the genius and the actress.</p> <p>Then suddenly the door opens and they come in and, of course, he has won; and he should win, they are his words. But she, she was saying the lines... but if you look at that, she says, \"Please, hold me. Please, love me\", but her face was mirroring every woman who has gone through their lives saying, \"I'm sorry.\" and ''What can I do for you?\" And she has the face of somebody who is so fed up of saying, \"Excuse me for being alive.\" I think it was masterful. So Ingmar got what he wanted, he got the lines, but he also got a really incredible performance. Maybe the whole thing was staged by him. That I don't know. But the result is fantastic.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Would he do that kind of thing? Destabilising you on set?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> No, he wouldn't... Well, what do I know?</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Well I was wondering how you get the pain in those performances? It's hard to switch that on and off.</p> <p> <strong>LU:</strong> He creates that kind of atmosphere where what you do is suddenly part of life the moment you are doing it. I was doing a suicide scene in Face to Face. I was told by him, \"You're sitting on your bed and you take these pills and then you lie down on the bed and then you die. And we'll do it in one take.\" And I thought, \"Is this all I'm getting?\" He didn't say more. But then just before he said for the camera to go he said, \"Oh, we did change the real pills for sugar pills?\" And that was so fantastic, I knew he was doing it with me, but my fantasy allowed him to do it with me. </p> <p>So the camera went and I knew that maybe these are the real pills, and I started to shiver a little on my hands. And I took the pills, more and more, and it became some kind of reality for me. I lied down and I was starting to experience it, and he never said cut. So I had to lie there and what do I do now? Yes. This is my childhood room and look at the tapestry, those beautiful flowers, and don't you think that if she was dying she would put her fingers on those tapestry flowers as she must have done when she was a little girl and I did that. I was moved by that. That was also set by Ingmar, the flowers, but he never said it. And he still didn't say cut. What is happening? And I had a watch, and I have to look at the watch because I have to know what time I am dying and I was so moved by that fantasy that I almost died. And I closed my eyes! And it was over. And Ingmar said, \"Thank you. Now I don't have to commit suicide.\" </p> <p>It's really hard to tell you, but a masterful audience will put you in that kind of mood, where everything suddenly becomes reality. The audience is quiet and listening to you, and you want to give more. That's where he was so good. He gave you great blocking and great atmosphere and the space to try things.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you bring out the performances in your actors?</p> <p> <strong>LU:</strong> It really has to do with trust. I must be trustworthy so that they can create. I am not going to ask them to do less of more unless it's really true. The fantastic scene you saw (Faithless) when Lena Endre is sitting in the window and she is talking about leaving her child. It is an 8-10 minute take on her face. The first time she did it, it was magnificent - it was an actress; you could see the technique and if anyone saw it they would say what a fantastic actress. But I knew she could do more. So I said, that was fantastic, everyone will praise you, but I want more. Just think of that little child walking out and think of her back and her head that doesn't turn towards you, and that is going to be an image that you will carry with you for the rest of your life. Be Lena. </p> <p>Then she did it one more time. And magic happened. And it wasn't like this big applause they say you get from people in the studio when something is good. There was a fantastic silence and she left the studio and some of the workers were patting her on the shoulder. She allowed herself to be the person, she wasn't doing the person. It is hard to explain.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Would you say a lot of screen acting is about forgetting that technique?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Yes. If you see the technique, it is good but it is not there. When you see a naked face then it's really there. When you are moved to the inner core of yourself, it is really there. If you cut away from that face four times you will lose that.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Was it a coincidence that both your films have featured Jewish families?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> In a way it was coincidence. In Sofie, that was about a Jewish family, so everyone except the painter was Jewish. I do not really know why the husband in Faithless was Jewish. It probably belongs to the way Ingmar sees family and he believes that no one represents the family as well as a Jewish man and woman, but I'm just guessing now, coming from a long family history. But it was a coincidence. But I elected to do the first film because it was a Jewish story and I wanted to do that because, maybe for the same reasons. I wanted to show a family with traditions. Erland Josephson, who played the lead in that, was the only Jewish person in Sofie, and he had forgotten so much about his childhood. Since he was a child had not eaten kosher food and had forgotten the songs. But while we did the movie he remembered everything: the songs, the Hebrew language. It is also where my personal story has come from, although I am not Jewish.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You talked about Ingrid's struggle with Ingmar's text. How was it dealing with Ingmar's text as a director?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> I didn't change a word. Of course a lot of things were taken away, otherwise it would have been six hours long. I had the freedom to do that, but I never changed words that were being said. I also had a freedom because not having written it myself I didn't have to defend the words because they were already there. Ingmar may have had pain when Ingrid was talking that way, but I had the freedom to do the shooting script because he had written it as a monologue. He wanted me to do the shooting script because, just like in the film, he wanted a woman to come in and give her [point of view on] what had happened to him once. I allowed myself to take that freedom and not to ask him whether I had done what he wanted.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Did he come on set?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> No. Never. He came on the last day and took some photographs. That was fantastic - that is full of trust. The pre-production was one year and he never asked anything. He never came on the set and he never came to the editing table and I admire him a lot for that. I don't think I could have done that. But he did it. He dares to show trust. I was faithful, I didn't do things that I thought would be wrong against who he is.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why did you change from acting to directing? Why aren't you acting in any more films?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Well, that has to do with age. Partly because they were not queuing up for me and partly because I had decided that I didn't really want to act anymore. There aren't that many good directors like Ingmar and sometimes, with a certain age, you get impatient while they are doing their homework on you. I really didn't want to do that. And life was good to me. It gave me a new opportunity that I'm so grateful for. People say that your life is over at 40, and my life was fantastic at 40. People say life is over at 50, and I went into a new career. Now I'm more than 60 and that is why I want to take a pause, in case there is something else to do. <strong>[<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124ullmann3.ra\">Listen to the soundclip (58 secs) </a>]</strong></p> <p>It doesn't have to be a career. Life is there whatever. If you are there in the garden or whatever. Life is very generous if you allow it to be generous, for us who are privileged to have choices.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> What did you mean by 'taking a pause'? From making films or from acting in films?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Acting, that's over with.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Completely? Nothing would coax you back?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Well, I never know about tomorrow, but I don't think so. I don't want to worry about the way I look, I want to worry about the way I live. To know that whatever happens, if I am to spend two-and-a-half years on a film, it must be life affirming. Or I can say I want to see my grandchild on a trip. To be free to say, \"Yes, why not?\" I never did that.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> There's no project at the moment?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> I have scripts lying there, but I'm so far... I want to take a pause and see what I want to do.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What was the experience like, of acting with and directing Erland Josephson?</p> <p> <strong>LU:</strong> Well, he is one of my best friends and we've known each other for thirty-five years. He was the only one I was nervous of directing because we are used to talking in breaks and talking bad about the director, sharing all these wonderful secrets. Suddenly I was isolated. I don't know if they were talking bad about me, but I wasn't part of that group anymore. But he was fantastic, he switched from being my playmate to listening to me as a director and honoured me with that. And he gave in a new way that was very different to what he gave me when I was an actor. He has been in all four films I have done, and I cannot really see a filmset without him. He is a very good man. It worked very much because of him, because he allowed me to change my part. </p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> When you and Bibi Andersson were lying in bed in that classroom talking about what you wanted to achieve, have you surpassed your expectations?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Oh, yes. I could never have imagined. I think life is wonderful and I am tremendously grateful in that I still have Bibi and we can still lie down on the sofa and talk about what we want to do next. That friendship has lasted. If I have nothing else to do, I can be an icon! </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,427066,00.html\">Back to top of article</a></p> <p><strong>Sound clips</strong><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124ullmann3.ra\">On moving from acting to directing</a> (58 secs)</p>",

      "bodyText": "Liv Ullmann on: acting in A Doll's House | Bergman's meeting with Woody Allen | acting with Ingrid Bergman | Ingmar Bergman's working methods | her own methods | working with Erland Josephson SD: Tell me the story of the meeting between Woody Allen and Ingmar Bergman that you managed to engineer... LU: Oh, yes. I was performing in New York doing The Doll's House, and this was in the middle of the women's liberation in the 70s in the United States. Can I just tell you this story first? SD: Er... yes. LU: I was doing it with Sam Waterston. I was Nora and he was Helmer. Sam always played the nice guy. And this was women's liberation. We did the rehearsals and Sam was very happy and I was happy and then we had the audience there for the first time two days before the premiere. They started booing when Helmer, my husband, came in. Each time I said something it was, \"Oh, wonderful! Wonderful!\" Anything I said! When he said something it was, \"Boo!\" It was terrible. And in the end, when I left the stage, they applauded, and he had one line, \"I don't understand\", and they really booed him. Sam was so shaken afterwards he almost didn't want to do it anymore. So to pep him up I said we should do yoga before. So the day before the premiere we did some yoga and Sam stretched his toe a little, so he had to go onstage with a stick. And, you know, they really didn't boo because he had this stick. They still said, \"Bravo! Bravo!\" when Nora said something, but they were much more quiet. And when I left the stage they kind of felt sorry because he was sitting there with a stick. Now this is the honest-to-God truth I am telling you. The next day was the premiere. Sam Waterston came in on crutches. He did the whole run on crutches and nobody applauded when I left anymore. It was a success and it was a new way of doing the play. So Ingmar wanted to come to the United States to see this. But he is very isolated. Woody Allen kept inviting me out for dinner because he admired Ingmar so much. References to Ingmar all the time. So I told him that Ingmar was coming to town. Woody said, \"Aaah! Can I meet him? I can't believe it.\" So I called Ingmar and said that Woody Allen wanted to meet him, and he said, \"That would be a pleasure.\" So Ingmar came for two days only and on one day he would see the play and the next day he would have dinner in his hotel suite because, you know, he is a genius and so he doesn't go on the streets and thing... So we would have dinner with Woody in his suite. So Woody collected me from the theatre the second day in a limo with a chauffeur who wore white gloves who you couldn't address - he's also a kind of genius! So we sat in this limo and Woody was so nervous. We got to the suite and the door opens. The two look at each other. You should have seen their eyes: they just looked at each other. \"Hello.\" \"Hello.\" And that was the only thing the two of them said, hello hello. That is true. So we sat down at the dinner table and they didn't talk to each other! And Ingrid, who is Ingmar's wife, who is not normally allowed to talk when there are artists there, she was talking! SD: But you have a bit of a problem with Ingrid... LU: We didn't have that contact, we didn't share that much... but... you know, she's a great cook! So we talked about the meatballs! This is really true. And when we said something really silly, the two geniuses would look at each other and, you know, think, \"Hmm. Little women.\" You know. And for dessert, to put hurt upon hurt, she had an envelope with my child support - I got $1,500 a year in child support - and she gave that envelope to me over the table. So it was a strange dinner. And then it was over, and I'm not even sure they said goodbye. They kind of looked at each other with this knowing smile. Then I went back with Woody in his limo and he said, \"Thank you Liv. That was an experience.\" Ingmar then called me when I got back to my room and said, \"Thank you Liv. He is really special.\" They didn't say a word to each other the whole dinner. SD: Let's open it up to some questions from the audience. Q: What recent films have you seen that you liked? LU: I get all these movies that are nominated for Oscars and I see them on tapes which really is not how you should see them. I saw Hitching Dragon... Flying What... That one by Ang Lee. I thought that was fantastic. I don't know about the story, but the images and these people fighting but flowing through the air... I thought that was fantastic. And I saw another movie, the script was not so good, but I saw an actress I have admired for some years, Cate Blanchett. She is doing such an extraordinary performance in a movie that perhaps isn't the best. She is really, apart from Lena Endre, she is really... well she is younger than Lena, so I would say she is the best actor of her generation and Lena Endre of hers. It is very difficult if you are an actress to be good in a bad film, but she manages that. SD: Would you consider working with international stars like that, or is it important for you to work within Scandinavia? LU: No. It is important for me to work with something that is close to my heart, and it doesn't matter to me what language they speak. Cate Blanchett, she is a soul mate, I can see. Languages are no problem, but it would be a problem if it was a Hollywood film because you don't get the last edit, and you can't have people editing your film. They haven't asked me either. Q: Why isn't there a Bergman retrospective at the NFT so young people can see Bergman, and what was it like acting with Ingrid Bergman. SD: I'll answer the first part. Bergman prints are very hard to get hold of. Even to get the extracts we showed tonight. LU: I did hear that there may be a retrospective here. Maybe people could demand it. Working with Ingrid was an incredible joy. I admire her so much. What was good with her was that she was so honest, she came out with everything she felt, and that is sometimes difficult if you work with somebody like Ingmar. You respect him so much, and I'm using this word genius, and I mean it from my heart, but sometimes I am also using it in a special way... to explain... Ingrid was important because she did not qualify him as anything other than a director. I used to sit there and admire her, that she said everything that she did. We played a mother and a daughter, and we said to Ingmar, \"Why are you making the mother so unsympathetic, just because she also wants to have a career. Can we change the words?\" And Ingmar said, \"No, you cannot change the words.\" We said, \"Can we play against the character?\" And he said, \"Yes, you are actresses, you can do that.\" Then there was this incredible episode happening when we did Autumn Sonata. I am the daughter and I am blaming my mother for everything I am in life. I am more than 40 years old, and there comes a time when you cannot blame your mother anymore. Somehow you are living your own life. But she goes on blaming her mother. So it is this scene where the mother is blaming her daughter and I had three pages of a monologue telling the mother how terrible she'd been, look at the misery of my life and it's all your fault. I go on and on and on through a whole night. And in the morning, Ingrid Bergman, as the mother, has two lines. \"Please, hold me. Please, love me.\" And I thought that was beautiful. If I had to do that, I would really make people cry, I would do it tenderly. So I did all my lines, and Ingrid just sat there, and I did the hate and the anger and everything. The camera was turned on to Ingrid and she was to say, \"Please, hold me. Please, love me.\" But she says, \"No! I'm not going to say that. I want to slap her in the face and leave the room.\" And it was incredible - no one has talked to him in that way. He was red and he said, \"That is your line.\" \"I'm not doing it.\" So they started to yell and went out of the studio. We all looked at each other and thought, \"The movie is going to end here.\" We heard the voices out there, really high voices - the genius and the actress. Then suddenly the door opens and they come in and, of course, he has won; and he should win, they are his words. But she, she was saying the lines... but if you look at that, she says, \"Please, hold me. Please, love me\", but her face was mirroring every woman who has gone through their lives saying, \"I'm sorry.\" and ''What can I do for you?\" And she has the face of somebody who is so fed up of saying, \"Excuse me for being alive.\" I think it was masterful. So Ingmar got what he wanted, he got the lines, but he also got a really incredible performance. Maybe the whole thing was staged by him. That I don't know. But the result is fantastic. SD: Would he do that kind of thing? Destabilising you on set? LU: No, he wouldn't... Well, what do I know? SD: Well I was wondering how you get the pain in those performances? It's hard to switch that on and off. LU: He creates that kind of atmosphere where what you do is suddenly part of life the moment you are doing it. I was doing a suicide scene in Face to Face. I was told by him, \"You're sitting on your bed and you take these pills and then you lie down on the bed and then you die. And we'll do it in one take.\" And I thought, \"Is this all I'm getting?\" He didn't say more. But then just before he said for the camera to go he said, \"Oh, we did change the real pills for sugar pills?\" And that was so fantastic, I knew he was doing it with me, but my fantasy allowed him to do it with me. So the camera went and I knew that maybe these are the real pills, and I started to shiver a little on my hands. And I took the pills, more and more, and it became some kind of reality for me. I lied down and I was starting to experience it, and he never said cut. So I had to lie there and what do I do now? Yes. This is my childhood room and look at the tapestry, those beautiful flowers, and don't you think that if she was dying she would put her fingers on those tapestry flowers as she must have done when she was a little girl and I did that. I was moved by that. That was also set by Ingmar, the flowers, but he never said it. And he still didn't say cut. What is happening? And I had a watch, and I have to look at the watch because I have to know what time I am dying and I was so moved by that fantasy that I almost died. And I closed my eyes! And it was over. And Ingmar said, \"Thank you. Now I don't have to commit suicide.\" It's really hard to tell you, but a masterful audience will put you in that kind of mood, where everything suddenly becomes reality. The audience is quiet and listening to you, and you want to give more. That's where he was so good. He gave you great blocking and great atmosphere and the space to try things. Q: How do you bring out the performances in your actors? LU: It really has to do with trust. I must be trustworthy so that they can create. I am not going to ask them to do less of more unless it's really true. The fantastic scene you saw (Faithless) when Lena Endre is sitting in the window and she is talking about leaving her child. It is an 8-10 minute take on her face. The first time she did it, it was magnificent - it was an actress; you could see the technique and if anyone saw it they would say what a fantastic actress. But I knew she could do more. So I said, that was fantastic, everyone will praise you, but I want more. Just think of that little child walking out and think of her back and her head that doesn't turn towards you, and that is going to be an image that you will carry with you for the rest of your life. Be Lena. Then she did it one more time. And magic happened. And it wasn't like this big applause they say you get from people in the studio when something is good. There was a fantastic silence and she left the studio and some of the workers were patting her on the shoulder. She allowed herself to be the person, she wasn't doing the person. It is hard to explain. SD: Would you say a lot of screen acting is about forgetting that technique? LU: Yes. If you see the technique, it is good but it is not there. When you see a naked face then it's really there. When you are moved to the inner core of yourself, it is really there. If you cut away from that face four times you will lose that. Q: Was it a coincidence that both your films have featured Jewish families? LU: In a way it was coincidence. In Sofie, that was about a Jewish family, so everyone except the painter was Jewish. I do not really know why the husband in Faithless was Jewish. It probably belongs to the way Ingmar sees family and he believes that no one represents the family as well as a Jewish man and woman, but I'm just guessing now, coming from a long family history. But it was a coincidence. But I elected to do the first film because it was a Jewish story and I wanted to do that because, maybe for the same reasons. I wanted to show a family with traditions. Erland Josephson, who played the lead in that, was the only Jewish person in Sofie, and he had forgotten so much about his childhood. Since he was a child had not eaten kosher food and had forgotten the songs. But while we did the movie he remembered everything: the songs, the Hebrew language. It is also where my personal story has come from, although I am not Jewish. Q: You talked about Ingrid's struggle with Ingmar's text. How was it dealing with Ingmar's text as a director? LU: I didn't change a word. Of course a lot of things were taken away, otherwise it would have been six hours long. I had the freedom to do that, but I never changed words that were being said. I also had a freedom because not having written it myself I didn't have to defend the words because they were already there. Ingmar may have had pain when Ingrid was talking that way, but I had the freedom to do the shooting script because he had written it as a monologue. He wanted me to do the shooting script because, just like in the film, he wanted a woman to come in and give her [point of view on] what had happened to him once. I allowed myself to take that freedom and not to ask him whether I had done what he wanted. SD: Did he come on set? LU: No. Never. He came on the last day and took some photographs. That was fantastic - that is full of trust. The pre-production was one year and he never asked anything. He never came on the set and he never came to the editing table and I admire him a lot for that. I don't think I could have done that. But he did it. He dares to show trust. I was faithful, I didn't do things that I thought would be wrong against who he is. Q: Why did you change from acting to directing? Why aren't you acting in any more films? LU: Well, that has to do with age. Partly because they were not queuing up for me and partly because I had decided that I didn't really want to act anymore. There aren't that many good directors like Ingmar and sometimes, with a certain age, you get impatient while they are doing their homework on you. I really didn't want to do that. And life was good to me. It gave me a new opportunity that I'm so grateful for. People say that your life is over at 40, and my life was fantastic at 40. People say life is over at 50, and I went into a new career. Now I'm more than 60 and that is why I want to take a pause, in case there is something else to do. [Listen to the soundclip (58 secs) ] It doesn't have to be a career. Life is there whatever. If you are there in the garden or whatever. Life is very generous if you allow it to be generous, for us who are privileged to have choices. SD: What did you mean by 'taking a pause'? From making films or from acting in films? LU: Acting, that's over with. SD: Completely? Nothing would coax you back? LU: Well, I never know about tomorrow, but I don't think so. I don't want to worry about the way I look, I want to worry about the way I live. To know that whatever happens, if I am to spend two-and-a-half years on a film, it must be life affirming. Or I can say I want to see my grandchild on a trip. To be free to say, \"Yes, why not?\" I never did that. SD: There's no project at the moment? LU: I have scripts lying there, but I'm so far... I want to take a pause and see what I want to do. Q: What was the experience like, of acting with and directing Erland Josephson? LU: Well, he is one of my best friends and we've known each other for thirty-five years. He was the only one I was nervous of directing because we are used to talking in breaks and talking bad about the director, sharing all these wonderful secrets. Suddenly I was isolated. I don't know if they were talking bad about me, but I wasn't part of that group anymore. But he was fantastic, he switched from being my playmate to listening to me as a director and honoured me with that. And he gave in a new way that was very different to what he gave me when I was an actor. He has been in all four films I have done, and I cannot really see a filmset without him. He is a very good man. It worked very much because of him, because he allowed me to change my part. SD: When you and Bibi Andersson were lying in bed in that classroom talking about what you wanted to achieve, have you surpassed your expectations? LU: Oh, yes. I could never have imagined. I think life is wonderful and I am tremendously grateful in that I still have Bibi and we can still lie down on the sofa and talk about what we want to do next. That friendship has lasted. If I have nothing else to do, I can be an icon! Back to top of article Sound clips \u0095 On moving from acting to directing (58 secs)",

      "body": "<p>Liv Ullmann on: <a href=\"#america\">working in America</a> <strong>|</strong> <a href=\"#audition\">auditioning for Richard Rodgers</a> <strong>|</strong> <a href=\"#art\">the relationship between art and life</a> <strong>|</strong> <a href=\"#modern\">on the state of modern cinema</a></p> <p><strong>Shane Danielson:</strong> Some of you might have heard that this event tonight is in some way a reprise of an interview in August at the Edinburgh Film Festival, and in the car on the way here both of us confessed that this is something like a second date for us. </p> <p>But one of the things I found out that night was that she didn't particularly like the word icon, though it's been used many times to describe her. She didn't object to it violently, but she did point out that an icon is something that is a couple of centuries old and covered in dust and can usually be found hanging on the wall of an Orthodox church rather than in front of a camera making good films. </p> <p>In place of icon I would like, therefore, to offer another word for Miss Ullmann, which is 'emblematic'. Because in the minds of cinema goers, particularly cinema goers of a certain generation, she is the personification of a certain kind of cinema, and identified too with a certain kind of director - in this case Ingmar Bergman. And it occurred to me that this was similar to the way another Scandinavian born actress, Anna Karina, was with another great director, Jean-Luc Godard. </p> <p>But the differences couldn't be more profound. Karina exemplified capriciousness and everything that, for Godard, was about the unknowability about women. Whereas Ullmann was always known: she projected a woman who laid herself open on the screen for us to see and seemed comfortable projecting the most naked and raw emotional states, and that's, I think, what we recognise in her and what many of us love and admire in her as well. </p> <p>Tonight, to start off, I've chosen two clips which I think highlight both sides of her career - both as a great screen actor and as a film-maker of international renown. The first clip is from the Bergman film The Shame - a single take framed almost entirely on her face - and the second clip is from her debut feature Sofie, in which she tried to retain the values in Bergman's films: the unflinching emotional honesty, the truth to characters and their motivations and the respect and compassion for everyone that is on the screen. </p> <p>The other difference between her and Karina is that Godard and Karina burned brightly and briefly whereas Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann have enjoyed a professional relationship which has varied between lover, muse, collaborator, actor for well over 30 years now, from Persona in 1966 to Faithless today. Here are the clips.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> When we turned up here in the car tonight there was a big crowd standing outside the doors and Liv looked out of the car and said in typical Liv terror, \"Ah! They hated the film! Everybody's walked out of the film.It's going to be a disaster. Why have you brought me here?\" And they turned out to be the hoards of autograph hunters. But the point is that one of these people just held out something for her to sign and said over and over again, \"You are lovely, you are lovely.\" And she certainly is, and one of the great film-makers of our day, Liv Ullmann.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> So, not an icon?</p> <p><strong>Liv Ullmann:</strong> Not an icon. Actually, what Shane said about outside the theatre was nicer than what I heard in the airport not so long ago. A lady, she came very close to me and looked at me and said, \"Didn't you use to be Liv Ullmann?\" So that was nicer!</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> You've tried to preserve many of the lessons you learnt with Bergman. Bergman casts such a long shadow over your career, for better or for worse...</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Well those are your words...</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> I go on the basis of the book you wrote, Changing.</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Well I wrote it 25 years ago...</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> So it was fresh from the heat of it in a way.</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Well, yes, but then I lived 25 more years. More than that. After we split up as a loving couple - that's 32 years because we have known each other for 36 years. I think it is. Yes, he is absolutely the best director I've worked with, as an actress on, I think, 10 films and as a director on two scripts. But I think what you are as a person is also part of what you reflect in your work, and so his shadow is not what I'm walking under. It's my life I'm working with and it is my life and my experience which I present. </p> <p>In terms of learning, what you learn the most from is - if it comes to directing - it's really the bad directors you have, because it's through the bad directors that you learn what you shouldn't do with actors and the people you are working with. Those that trample on your fantasy and do not respect your experience. You learn more from that if you want to be a director yourself. I would say I work in the sunlight of so much that Ingmar's given me. Actually, I don't work under anyone's shadow.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> I'm glad we cleared that one up.</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> That was the long answer.</p> <p> <strong>SD:</strong> You talked about bad directors, it seems to me that your biggest experience of those would have been when you went to work in America. There's a game I like to play on stage with somebody which is bringing up their worst film, and I have to say two words: Lost Horizon.</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Yeah, that was rather bad. There are a lot of critics who have that on their list of the 50 worst films that were ever made, and it almost tops them. But I had a fantastic time, and the cast - Charles Boyer, John Gielgud, Peter Finch - it was a great cast.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> That's what puzzles me. When you're on something like that and it turns out to be such a monumental turkey... I remember interviewing George Clooney about Out Of Sight and he'd just come off that Batman movie and he said that even when he was making it, he and the guy who played Robin were sitting there going, \"This is going to suck.\" Did you know that at the time?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> No! Well I knew that I couldn't dance and I couldn't sing...</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Which for a musical is kind of an obstacle...</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Yes, I know! I did say that to them and they said, \"Oh, it doesn't matter, you're so sweet and so charming, we'll work around it.\" So somebody sang my voice and then I danced, and that looked kind of stiff and strange, but what I said was true. It was my first time in Hollywood and I believed everything they said, and they said every woman in Hollywood wants to do your part in Lost Horizon, and I believed that too. I lived in this incredible house with this swimming pool and my friends came over, and the bathroom in the house was like, like this whole room! It was fantastic! Give that to any 31-year-old from Norway and they will think that it's the greatest time in their life.</p> <p>I still feel that the film wasn't a success, but it was a fantastically good time. As a matter of fact, that first year I was in Hollywood - it was my last year too - I did four movies. As opposed to Greta Garbo, who just grew and grew, I managed to close down two studios. And this is true! And it's fun for me because the tragedy never reached me, because by the time I'd done my year - and none of the films were out yet, so I still thought, \"Oh, what a success I am\" - I went to Sweden and the film I did then was Scenes From a Marriage, so I wasn't really aware that I had closed the two studios. <strong>[<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124ullmann1.ra\">Listen to the soundclip (45 secs)</a>]</strong></p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> At the time did you say in interviews in Sweden, \"They love me in America\"?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Yes I did that. And they said, \"She's really got stuck up now.\" They didn't understand that it was a great time. I still think it was a great time. I took the best of it with me and I went on from there and that was, like, 30 years ago, so who cares?</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Absolutely. You're associated with Bergman in so many films. You're also blurring the lines between collaboration and life partnership...</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> That was only for two films.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> But even then, after that, you're still in his orbit, in his films. When you got out of that, how was he about you being in The Emigrants (directed by Jan Troell), for example? Many directors get possessive and don't allow people to play in other fields...</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> He's a little like that. I did it anyway. And by the time I did The Emigrants it was more or less over in terms of the love relationship. As a matter of fact it was not Ingmar who brought me to Hollywood but The Emigrants...</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Because of the Golden Globe - you were nominated, yes?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> I won. And I was nominated for an Oscar and that was when I went to Hollywood and got the four films. He kind of realised that I wanted to taste that world and when all that was over I went back and did a film for him, and he thought, \"Well, she has learnt now and she'll do Scenes From a Marriage, and she'll be happy to be here.\"</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> How big a priority was it for you to be a success in America, in that after the European success you would have to start almost from the bottom...</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> You don't start from the bottom when you get a lead in a musical...</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> But Lost Horizon...</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> But it didn't seem like a tragedy. And what they couldn't do with me... because I was 31 years old, they couldn't do what they'd planned: create me into something different, because I was secure with the kind of person I was. And I had very good luggage because I had worked with Ingmar Bergman. I don't know if I had dreamt of being a success in Hollywood, I don't think I've ever been ambitious in that way. I just thought it was an incredible opportunity of life, and it came to me and I did it. And I don't regret it and for me, it gave me great pleasure. I think you should say \"Yes\", even if you do fall on your... behind.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> If you say \"No\" all the time then I suppose you never live.</p> <p> <strong>LU:</strong> That's true, because I did another musical. That one was on Broadway. That was maybe more sad because that was Richard Rodgers, and that was the last musical he ever wrote, and again they said it doesn't matter because I was still sweet, and I said I couldn't sing and to look at Lost Horizon. They thought it would go anyway. </p> <p>The musical was called I Remember Mamma, it was newly written, and I was taken to Richard Rodgers and I told him I really don't sing and he said, \"I'm used to that. I've had a lot of singers that don't sing. I just want to know your range.\" And I said, \"This is really embarrassing because I really don't\" and he said, \"Don't fear\". He was already sick and old and close to 80 at that time, and just sitting at his piano and he was so sweet and thin, and he said, \"Just sing Happy Birthday.\" So I sang Happy Birthday and he aged 10 years, just like that. </p> <p>The incredible thing with him was, and this was his last musical, and he knew he was making it for me - seven songs that I mishandled, and he came each night to the theatre and he was loving and nice and just kind. It was eight months of a fantastic thing on Broadway. And because I was older I knew what I was doing. I thought that this was going to be fun to tell my grandchildren, you know: \"I don't dance, I don't sing, and here I am a star in a musical.\"</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Which killed Richard Rodgers...</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> No. It didn't kill him. Because he was already sick before he met me...</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Moving swiftly along. You said you weren't particularly ambitious for success. You just wanted to make the films you wanted to make, and yet at the same time from an early age...</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> If life presents itself to you, you have to say 'Yes'. Or at least that was what I felt. Now I am more careful with my choices. Now I know it is more serious because I am older and everything. But you have to allow yourself, in my business, fiascos. Because that is what you really learn from. The other things you get so much praise from you can't learn anything from that. But when you do bad you have to think, why did I do badly, was it my choices, was it the way I did it, and you go on and have a better life because of that.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Did you believe the publicity you got, or were you always doubting yourself?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> I would doubt myself after the reviews of the mistakes, but that doesn't live forever either. It's now many years since I read reviews in that way and it doesn't mean what it used to mean because life is so much grander and more exceptional than to read reviews of what you do at work. Life is what you fill your day with, why you wake up in the morning and what you want to do in terms of being a human being. I'm not portrayed by what was bad and what was good in terms of my work, I'm portrayed by what I try to give in to my work.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Sure.</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Was that too serious?</p> <p> <strong>SD:</strong> No, not at all. In the second clip, from Sofie, I thought it showed the difference between Bergman, say, and yourself, that you've just touched on. The fact that you draw this distinction between life and your work and that one doesn't necessarily consume the other. The portraitist in the clip will take any emotion he can get, it's all grist to the mill, and that's what Bergman does, clearly.</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Yes, that's a kind of cannibal, but not necessarily in the wrong way. Some artists use every moment, how can I do this, how can I note this down, how can I use it. There are some people that do that, but also just live. I would rather be of that kind. When you die and God says, 'What did you do in life?' you can't just say, \"I did good work.' You have to say a lot of other things as well.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> You tried to live a good life.</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Yeah. I hated and I loved and I sang and well, whatever. I cam from the States this morning so if I say things like that it might be jet-lag too. </p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> You said in Edinburgh that you had remained friends with Bibi Andersson. There was a community of women around Bergman, but it didn't seem to be competitive, or if it was, not in a way that destroyed the group from within. I don't mean because you were women, but a group of creative people around a director doesn't necessarily encourage good behaviour.</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> We were very close friends, the women who worked for and with Bergman. Bibi Andersson and I are the best of friends and we are like sisters. The first time that we worked together was in Norway many years before I worked with Ingmar in a film, it was a Danish film. There were no houses, it was on an island north of Norway and we all lived in a school house and Bibi and I shared a classroom, there were beds in there. We used to lie at night and dream of the future, both of us were newly married and we were twenty years old and we said if we ever get to be parents we'd be godparents to each other's children. </p> <p> I think we bonded so strongly then that even though later I got to do more films with Ingmar than she did, she continued to be my sister and never faulted me. That says a lot about her strength and friendship is more important than work. I don't know if I would have reacted in the incredible way she did.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Was it hard having gone from being intimate with Ingmar to stepping back to a purely professional relationship?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Oh, that was a blessing, that really was. We did two films when we lived together, The Shame and The Passion of Anna, and the breakfasts were terrible. He would sit there thinking about what he was going to do, and if he had had nightmares he would tell me about that too, and I thought, \"Oh, god. I'm going to do that nightmare on film.\" It wasn't really life affirming for me. Later, when those things were behind us, we each could go home to our own home, where the other one wasn't; it was incredible. We worked so much better when we were friends, and we are truly very close friends, than we did when we had other agendas in our relationship. <strong>[<a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124ullmann2.ra\">Listen to the soundclip (55 secs) </a>]</strong></p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Was he supportive when you wanted to be a director?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Yes. He was very supportive. My first film, Sofie, I sent him the cut of the film when I was finished and asked him what he thought about it. And I thought a lot about what I had learned from Ingmar when I did that movie. For me to have been an actress was the best of schools to be a director because I know what it feels inside and I started to respect acting so much more. While I was still an actress I sometimes felt a little ashamed of being an actress...</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Why?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> I don't know. Because here I am, and there's so much going on in the world, and here I am an actress and people sit with you at dinner and they think they have to ask how it is to act, and how you learn your lines and things like that...</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Nothing very substantial...</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> No, because they think you don't. And so I almost felt ashamed. But I knew deep down, when it didn't have to be me, that actors are so creative and actors are so fantastic, the really good ones, to build on their own life and to use that, without being themselves, but to use the best and the wisest thing that they know about life.</p> <p>And the movie you have just seen (Faithless), to see Lena Endre give so much of her life so freely, I think it is the best performance in a movie. When you think of films and theatre you can take away the lights and the stage, everything, but you can never do without the word and the actors. </p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> I would imagine that actors want to work with you because you come from that background, because you understand. There is a level of trust established there immediately.</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> There has to be a lot of trust. First of all you have to be very open with who you are so that they know you are not hiding something. Then they really have to trust you so that they know whatever they give you, you are not going to misuse them. They must feel that, while you are sitting there with the camera, you are like a lover. If you are with someone who really loves you, and they look at you and they show you that you are the most wonderful person in the world, you will suddenly bloom. If you are a kind of rose, which these people are, they will be the best of roses if you allow them to be roses, and don't try to make them into a blue copy of some idea you had in your own workroom.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Did you ever feel close to cinema as a whole, were you a film fan? Did you feel passionately involved in the film world, or was it more isolated, because you were in Scandinavia?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> But, you know, we see films in Scandinavia too.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> I'm from Australia. We just got them last year.</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> When I was in Australia, Doris Day was still the icon.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> She's a big pinup for all of us. There's that sense, in the 60s and 70s, of an enclave up there, making a very specific kind of cinema that doesn't appear to be influenced by French cinema or Hollywood cinema. It was a parallel cinema.</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> That is true. Although I must say that we saw a lot of films undubbed. We saw Italian films, and French and Russian and from Czechoslovakia and from Poland, so we had a fantastic education in foreign films. Our films in the end did not look like these films, though these films really inspired us. When I was young and saw Vittorio De Sica's films, like The Bicycle Thieves, my whole view of life changed seeing these films. </p> <p> That's why it's so important the type of films young people see today. They sneak into your fantasy, maybe even more so today than before, because today people seem more isolated, and there are very few places where they are face to face with others, and cinema is one of the few places now that they can still be influenced. That is why it is so sad today that they are getting all these cartoon movies and slice movies, when in my time we had much more grownup movies. It is cut-cut-cut-cut, you never get to see what life is about, what your heart is about, what your pulse is about. When you look at people you don't look back and forth; you look at people and movies should reflect that, and they don't do that anymore.</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> With DVD and video, even the communal experience is declining. There is a breakdown of that community. Do you feel endangered by Hollywood in Norway? Is that as strong there as in the rest of Europe, and is the push to resist that as strong?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> It's like, I'm sure, it is in England. I think something like 80% of the films that we see are Hollywood movies, and the more people see these kinds of movies the harder it is to get them in to other movies, because they don't want to see it, because it's long, and slow. People have this haste: \"It can't be too long because then I have to go out and... \" What do they have to do? Life is long! Can't they give two hours, or more, and see if something changes in their life? Or maybe they'll have something to talk about with someone? Or maybe they are shocked and they decide something is going to be different in their life. It is good to be influenced. </p> <p>It's great to be in a movie house and be a participant. In so many movies you are not a participant. But to be a participant, even if you don't like the movie, something is somehow shaken within you. That is good. We need to be part of life, we can't just be watching a screen, and watching what is happening, and watching the politicians, and watching everything. We have to be part of it. Not passive. So much in our time is making us passive because we don't know what's going on anymore. Wars happen and we don't know what the war is about. Politicians are elected and people don't even know how to elect them!</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> The core of Bergman's films is a watchfulness and almost a 19th century view that character decides destiny. Yet that is so unpopular and radically unfashionable. Do you get depressed in terms of whether you can keep making films, or if the films will find an audience? Do you just make something and hope it will connect with an audience somewhere?</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> Yes, I hope. But then I'm 62 years old. If I was 30 I would be more worried because I would wonder whether I could continue to make films this way. But I am not worried for me or for what my future will be, but I am worried for the audience and the film-makers. It is tough for film-makers if they want to make a more serious, or even a comedy, done seriously. But most of all I am worried for young people because they cannot go to the cinema and experience the wonder when the bell rings and the curtain goes and something is happening there. On the plane nowadays, the Farrel brothers?</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> Farrelly brothers.</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> They were raping a chicken! It's not even fun!</p> <p><strong>SD:</strong> I know. In Australia you have to take what you can get.</p> <p><strong>LU:</strong> I was in Australia and they have a very different way of seeing things. Many years ago I did this Cocteau play called The Human Voice. It's about a woman, and she's on the phone, and that's all you see. She is on the phone with her lover who is apparently breaking up with her and she just cannot let him go. It's a really sad monologue. And she says, \"Please don't hang up, don't hang up.\" And she's struggling for her life. It had been a success everywhere we'd been, and then we came to Sydney. On the second night, people had come because I was a star in Australia at that time, I was saying, \"Don't hang up, oh, please, don't hang up.\" And I hear from the gallery, \"Oh, please hang up!\". And that's what I felt.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,6737,427090,00.html\">To next page</a></p> <p><strong>Sound clips</strong><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124ullmann1.ra\">On her fleeting Hollywood career</a> (45 secs)<br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0124ullmann2.ra\">On working with Bergman after their break-up </a> (55 secs)</p>",

      "bodyText": "Liv Ullmann on: working in America | auditioning for Richard Rodgers | the relationship between art and life | on the state of modern cinema Shane Danielson: Some of you might have heard that this event tonight is in some way a reprise of an interview in August at the Edinburgh Film Festival, and in the car on the way here both of us confessed that this is something like a second date for us. But one of the things I found out that night was that she didn't particularly like the word icon, though it's been used many times to describe her. She didn't object to it violently, but she did point out that an icon is something that is a couple of centuries old and covered in dust and can usually be found hanging on the wall of an Orthodox church rather than in front of a camera making good films. In place of icon I would like, therefore, to offer another word for Miss Ullmann, which is 'emblematic'. Because in the minds of cinema goers, particularly cinema goers of a certain generation, she is the personification of a certain kind of cinema, and identified too with a certain kind of director - in this case Ingmar Bergman. And it occurred to me that this was similar to the way another Scandinavian born actress, Anna Karina, was with another great director, Jean-Luc Godard. But the differences couldn't be more profound. Karina exemplified capriciousness and everything that, for Godard, was about the unknowability about women. Whereas Ullmann was always known: she projected a woman who laid herself open on the screen for us to see and seemed comfortable projecting the most naked and raw emotional states, and that's, I think, what we recognise in her and what many of us love and admire in her as well. Tonight, to start off, I've chosen two clips which I think highlight both sides of her career - both as a great screen actor and as a film-maker of international renown. The first clip is from the Bergman film The Shame - a single take framed almost entirely on her face - and the second clip is from her debut feature Sofie, in which she tried to retain the values in Bergman's films: the unflinching emotional honesty, the truth to characters and their motivations and the respect and compassion for everyone that is on the screen. The other difference between her and Karina is that Godard and Karina burned brightly and briefly whereas Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann have enjoyed a professional relationship which has varied between lover, muse, collaborator, actor for well over 30 years now, from Persona in 1966 to Faithless today. Here are the clips. SD: When we turned up here in the car tonight there was a big crowd standing outside the doors and Liv looked out of the car and said in typical Liv terror, \"Ah! They hated the film! Everybody's walked out of the film.It's going to be a disaster. Why have you brought me here?\" And they turned out to be the hoards of autograph hunters. But the point is that one of these people just held out something for her to sign and said over and over again, \"You are lovely, you are lovely.\" And she certainly is, and one of the great film-makers of our day, Liv Ullmann. SD: So, not an icon? Liv Ullmann: Not an icon. Actually, what Shane said about outside the theatre was nicer than what I heard in the airport not so long ago. A lady, she came very close to me and looked at me and said, \"Didn't you use to be Liv Ullmann?\" So that was nicer! SD: You've tried to preserve many of the lessons you learnt with Bergman. Bergman casts such a long shadow over your career, for better or for worse... LU: Well those are your words... SD: I go on the basis of the book you wrote, Changing. LU: Well I wrote it 25 years ago... SD: So it was fresh from the heat of it in a way. LU: Well, yes, but then I lived 25 more years. More than that. After we split up as a loving couple - that's 32 years because we have known each other for 36 years. I think it is. Yes, he is absolutely the best director I've worked with, as an actress on, I think, 10 films and as a director on two scripts. But I think what you are as a person is also part of what you reflect in your work, and so his shadow is not what I'm walking under. It's my life I'm working with and it is my life and my experience which I present. In terms of learning, what you learn the most from is - if it comes to directing - it's really the bad directors you have, because it's through the bad directors that you learn what you shouldn't do with actors and the people you are working with. Those that trample on your fantasy and do not respect your experience. You learn more from that if you want to be a director yourself. I would say I work in the sunlight of so much that Ingmar's given me. Actually, I don't work under anyone's shadow. SD: I'm glad we cleared that one up. LU: That was the long answer. SD: You talked about bad directors, it seems to me that your biggest experience of those would have been when you went to work in America. There's a game I like to play on stage with somebody which is bringing up their worst film, and I have to say two words: Lost Horizon. LU: Yeah, that was rather bad. There are a lot of critics who have that on their list of the 50 worst films that were ever made, and it almost tops them. But I had a fantastic time, and the cast - Charles Boyer, John Gielgud, Peter Finch - it was a great cast. SD: That's what puzzles me. When you're on something like that and it turns out to be such a monumental turkey... I remember interviewing George Clooney about Out Of Sight and he'd just come off that Batman movie and he said that even when he was making it, he and the guy who played Robin were sitting there going, \"This is going to suck.\" Did you know that at the time? LU: No! Well I knew that I couldn't dance and I couldn't sing... SD: Which for a musical is kind of an obstacle... LU: Yes, I know! I did say that to them and they said, \"Oh, it doesn't matter, you're so sweet and so charming, we'll work around it.\" So somebody sang my voice and then I danced, and that looked kind of stiff and strange, but what I said was true. It was my first time in Hollywood and I believed everything they said, and they said every woman in Hollywood wants to do your part in Lost Horizon, and I believed that too. I lived in this incredible house with this swimming pool and my friends came over, and the bathroom in the house was like, like this whole room! It was fantastic! Give that to any 31-year-old from Norway and they will think that it's the greatest time in their life. I still feel that the film wasn't a success, but it was a fantastically good time. As a matter of fact, that first year I was in Hollywood - it was my last year too - I did four movies. As opposed to Greta Garbo, who just grew and grew, I managed to close down two studios. And this is true! And it's fun for me because the tragedy never reached me, because by the time I'd done my year - and none of the films were out yet, so I still thought, \"Oh, what a success I am\" - I went to Sweden and the film I did then was Scenes From a Marriage, so I wasn't really aware that I had closed the two studios. [Listen to the soundclip (45 secs)] SD: At the time did you say in interviews in Sweden, \"They love me in America\"? LU: Yes I did that. And they said, \"She's really got stuck up now.\" They didn't understand that it was a great time. I still think it was a great time. I took the best of it with me and I went on from there and that was, like, 30 years ago, so who cares? SD: Absolutely. You're associated with Bergman in so many films. You're also blurring the lines between collaboration and life partnership... LU: That was only for two films. SD: But even then, after that, you're still in his orbit, in his films. When you got out of that, how was he about you being in The Emigrants (directed by Jan Troell), for example? Many directors get possessive and don't allow people to play in other fields... LU: He's a little like that. I did it anyway. And by the time I did The Emigrants it was more or less over in terms of the love relationship. As a matter of fact it was not Ingmar who brought me to Hollywood but The Emigrants... SD: Because of the Golden Globe - you were nominated, yes? LU: I won. And I was nominated for an Oscar and that was when I went to Hollywood and got the four films. He kind of realised that I wanted to taste that world and when all that was over I went back and did a film for him, and he thought, \"Well, she has learnt now and she'll do Scenes From a Marriage, and she'll be happy to be here.\" SD: How big a priority was it for you to be a success in America, in that after the European success you would have to start almost from the bottom... LU: You don't start from the bottom when you get a lead in a musical... SD: But Lost Horizon... LU: But it didn't seem like a tragedy. And what they couldn't do with me... because I was 31 years old, they couldn't do what they'd planned: create me into something different, because I was secure with the kind of person I was. And I had very good luggage because I had worked with Ingmar Bergman. I don't know if I had dreamt of being a success in Hollywood, I don't think I've ever been ambitious in that way. I just thought it was an incredible opportunity of life, and it came to me and I did it. And I don't regret it and for me, it gave me great pleasure. I think you should say \"Yes\", even if you do fall on your... behind. SD: If you say \"No\" all the time then I suppose you never live. LU: That's true, because I did another musical. That one was on Broadway. That was maybe more sad because that was Richard Rodgers, and that was the last musical he ever wrote, and again they said it doesn't matter because I was still sweet, and I said I couldn't sing and to look at Lost Horizon. They thought it would go anyway. The musical was called I Remember Mamma, it was newly written, and I was taken to Richard Rodgers and I told him I really don't sing and he said, \"I'm used to that. I've had a lot of singers that don't sing. I just want to know your range.\" And I said, \"This is really embarrassing because I really don't\" and he said, \"Don't fear\". He was already sick and old and close to 80 at that time, and just sitting at his piano and he was so sweet and thin, and he said, \"Just sing Happy Birthday.\" So I sang Happy Birthday and he aged 10 years, just like that. The incredible thing with him was, and this was his last musical, and he knew he was making it for me - seven songs that I mishandled, and he came each night to the theatre and he was loving and nice and just kind. It was eight months of a fantastic thing on Broadway. And because I was older I knew what I was doing. I thought that this was going to be fun to tell my grandchildren, you know: \"I don't dance, I don't sing, and here I am a star in a musical.\" SD: Which killed Richard Rodgers... LU: No. It didn't kill him. Because he was already sick before he met me... SD: Moving swiftly along. You said you weren't particularly ambitious for success. You just wanted to make the films you wanted to make, and yet at the same time from an early age... LU: If life presents itself to you, you have to say 'Yes'. Or at least that was what I felt. Now I am more careful with my choices. Now I know it is more serious because I am older and everything. But you have to allow yourself, in my business, fiascos. Because that is what you really learn from. The other things you get so much praise from you can't learn anything from that. But when you do bad you have to think, why did I do badly, was it my choices, was it the way I did it, and you go on and have a better life because of that. SD: Did you believe the publicity you got, or were you always doubting yourself? LU: I would doubt myself after the reviews of the mistakes, but that doesn't live forever either. It's now many years since I read reviews in that way and it doesn't mean what it used to mean because life is so much grander and more exceptional than to read reviews of what you do at work. Life is what you fill your day with, why you wake up in the morning and what you want to do in terms of being a human being. I'm not portrayed by what was bad and what was good in terms of my work, I'm portrayed by what I try to give in to my work. SD: Sure. LU: Was that too serious? SD: No, not at all. In the second clip, from Sofie, I thought it showed the difference between Bergman, say, and yourself, that you've just touched on. The fact that you draw this distinction between life and your work and that one doesn't necessarily consume the other. The portraitist in the clip will take any emotion he can get, it's all grist to the mill, and that's what Bergman does, clearly. LU: Yes, that's a kind of cannibal, but not necessarily in the wrong way. Some artists use every moment, how can I do this, how can I note this down, how can I use it. There are some people that do that, but also just live. I would rather be of that kind. When you die and God says, 'What did you do in life?' you can't just say, \"I did good work.' You have to say a lot of other things as well. SD: You tried to live a good life. LU: Yeah. I hated and I loved and I sang and well, whatever. I cam from the States this morning so if I say things like that it might be jet-lag too. SD: You said in Edinburgh that you had remained friends with Bibi Andersson. There was a community of women around Bergman, but it didn't seem to be competitive, or if it was, not in a way that destroyed the group from within. I don't mean because you were women, but a group of creative people around a director doesn't necessarily encourage good behaviour. LU: We were very close friends, the women who worked for and with Bergman. Bibi Andersson and I are the best of friends and we are like sisters. The first time that we worked together was in Norway many years before I worked with Ingmar in a film, it was a Danish film. There were no houses, it was on an island north of Norway and we all lived in a school house and Bibi and I shared a classroom, there were beds in there. We used to lie at night and dream of the future, both of us were newly married and we were twenty years old and we said if we ever get to be parents we'd be godparents to each other's children. I think we bonded so strongly then that even though later I got to do more films with Ingmar than she did, she continued to be my sister and never faulted me. That says a lot about her strength and friendship is more important than work. I don't know if I would have reacted in the incredible way she did. SD: Was it hard having gone from being intimate with Ingmar to stepping back to a purely professional relationship? LU: Oh, that was a blessing, that really was. We did two films when we lived together, The Shame and The Passion of Anna, and the breakfasts were terrible. He would sit there thinking about what he was going to do, and if he had had nightmares he would tell me about that too, and I thought, \"Oh, god. I'm going to do that nightmare on film.\" It wasn't really life affirming for me. Later, when those things were behind us, we each could go home to our own home, where the other one wasn't; it was incredible. We worked so much better when we were friends, and we are truly very close friends, than we did when we had other agendas in our relationship. [Listen to the soundclip (55 secs) ] SD: Was he supportive when you wanted to be a director? LU: Yes. He was very supportive. My first film, Sofie, I sent him the cut of the film when I was finished and asked him what he thought about it. And I thought a lot about what I had learned from Ingmar when I did that movie. For me to have been an actress was the best of schools to be a director because I know what it feels inside and I started to respect acting so much more. While I was still an actress I sometimes felt a little ashamed of being an actress... SD: Why? LU: I don't know. Because here I am, and there's so much going on in the world, and here I am an actress and people sit with you at dinner and they think they have to ask how it is to act, and how you learn your lines and things like that... SD: Nothing very substantial... LU: No, because they think you don't. And so I almost felt ashamed. But I knew deep down, when it didn't have to be me, that actors are so creative and actors are so fantastic, the really good ones, to build on their own life and to use that, without being themselves, but to use the best and the wisest thing that they know about life. And the movie you have just seen (Faithless), to see Lena Endre give so much of her life so freely, I think it is the best performance in a movie. When you think of films and theatre you can take away the lights and the stage, everything, but you can never do without the word and the actors. SD: I would imagine that actors want to work with you because you come from that background, because you understand. There is a level of trust established there immediately. LU: There has to be a lot of trust. First of all you have to be very open with who you are so that they know you are not hiding something. Then they really have to trust you so that they know whatever they give you, you are not going to misuse them. They must feel that, while you are sitting there with the camera, you are like a lover. If you are with someone who really loves you, and they look at you and they show you that you are the most wonderful person in the world, you will suddenly bloom. If you are a kind of rose, which these people are, they will be the best of roses if you allow them to be roses, and don't try to make them into a blue copy of some idea you had in your own workroom. SD: Did you ever feel close to cinema as a whole, were you a film fan? Did you feel passionately involved in the film world, or was it more isolated, because you were in Scandinavia? LU: But, you know, we see films in Scandinavia too. SD: I'm from Australia. We just got them last year. LU: When I was in Australia, Doris Day was still the icon. SD: She's a big pinup for all of us. There's that sense, in the 60s and 70s, of an enclave up there, making a very specific kind of cinema that doesn't appear to be influenced by French cinema or Hollywood cinema. It was a parallel cinema. LU: That is true. Although I must say that we saw a lot of films undubbed. We saw Italian films, and French and Russian and from Czechoslovakia and from Poland, so we had a fantastic education in foreign films. Our films in the end did not look like these films, though these films really inspired us. When I was young and saw Vittorio De Sica's films, like The Bicycle Thieves, my whole view of life changed seeing these films. That's why it's so important the type of films young people see today. They sneak into your fantasy, maybe even more so today than before, because today people seem more isolated, and there are very few places where they are face to face with others, and cinema is one of the few places now that they can still be influenced. That is why it is so sad today that they are getting all these cartoon movies and slice movies, when in my time we had much more grownup movies. It is cut-cut-cut-cut, you never get to see what life is about, what your heart is about, what your pulse is about. When you look at people you don't look back and forth; you look at people and movies should reflect that, and they don't do that anymore. SD: With DVD and video, even the communal experience is declining. There is a breakdown of that community. Do you feel endangered by Hollywood in Norway? Is that as strong there as in the rest of Europe, and is the push to resist that as strong? LU: It's like, I'm sure, it is in England. I think something like 80% of the films that we see are Hollywood movies, and the more people see these kinds of movies the harder it is to get them in to other movies, because they don't want to see it, because it's long, and slow. People have this haste: \"It can't be too long because then I have to go out and... \" What do they have to do? Life is long! Can't they give two hours, or more, and see if something changes in their life? Or maybe they'll have something to talk about with someone? Or maybe they are shocked and they decide something is going to be different in their life. It is good to be influenced. It's great to be in a movie house and be a participant. In so many movies you are not a participant. But to be a participant, even if you don't like the movie, something is somehow shaken within you. That is good. We need to be part of life, we can't just be watching a screen, and watching what is happening, and watching the politicians, and watching everything. We have to be part of it. Not passive. So much in our time is making us passive because we don't know what's going on anymore. Wars happen and we don't know what the war is about. Politicians are elected and people don't even know how to elect them! SD: The core of Bergman's films is a watchfulness and almost a 19th century view that character decides destiny. Yet that is so unpopular and radically unfashionable. Do you get depressed in terms of whether you can keep making films, or if the films will find an audience? Do you just make something and hope it will connect with an audience somewhere? LU: Yes, I hope. But then I'm 62 years old. If I was 30 I would be more worried because I would wonder whether I could continue to make films this way. But I am not worried for me or for what my future will be, but I am worried for the audience and the film-makers. It is tough for film-makers if they want to make a more serious, or even a comedy, done seriously. But most of all I am worried for young people because they cannot go to the cinema and experience the wonder when the bell rings and the curtain goes and something is happening there. On the plane nowadays, the Farrel brothers? SD: Farrelly brothers. LU: They were raping a chicken! It's not even fun! SD: I know. In Australia you have to take what you can get. LU: I was in Australia and they have a very different way of seeing things. Many years ago I did this Cocteau play called The Human Voice. It's about a woman, and she's on the phone, and that's all you see. She is on the phone with her lover who is apparently breaking up with her and she just cannot let him go. It's a really sad monologue. And she says, \"Please don't hang up, don't hang up.\" And she's struggling for her life. It had been a success everywhere we'd been, and then we came to Sydney. On the second night, people had come because I was a star in Australia at that time, I was saying, \"Don't hang up, oh, please, don't hang up.\" And I hear from the gallery, \"Oh, please hang up!\". And that's what I felt. To next page Sound clips \u0095 On her fleeting Hollywood career (45 secs) \u0095 On working with Bergman after their break-up (55 secs)",

The party's national executive committee is expected to get the power to draw up shortlists in any seats that fall vacant after January 31, amid grassroots pressure to ensure that more women get the chance to fight for seats and maintain the number of women MPs at Westminster - a record 101 in 1997.

There is particular concern that, of the 35 Labour MPs standing down, (five of them women) only five of their replacments - they include Mo Mowlam's successor in Redcar - are female. Without drastic last minute action the number of Labour women is certain to fall. A series of safer seats are expected to fall vacant as sitting MPs step down at the last minute, some possibly tempted by the offer of peerages or another post. The most recent was announced on Friday when Giles Radice, 64, veteran MP for North Durham and chairman of the Treasury select committee, said he was standing down. Among those Millbank is thought to be seeking a seat for is Shaun Woodward, the Tory-turned-Labour MP exempted from the \"chicken run\" ban after deciding not to stand again in the Witney seat, which he won for the Conservatives in 1997. Five Labour held seats, where a new candidate has yet to be picked, are Jeff Rooker's in Birmingham Perry Barr, Mr Radice's in North Durham, Lawrence Cunliffe's in Leigh, Paul Marsden's in Shrewsbury and Atcham, and Tom Pendry in Stalybridge and Hyde. The NEC is likely to step in and take control of the selection procedures if they are not completed by the middle of March, at the latest. Tom Cox, veteran MP for Tooting, is also singled out by some MPs as probably likely to retire. Sometimes, though, MPs decide to hang on. Tam Dalyell, now aged 68, found himself the object of Millbank-inspired rumours that he would quit, but consulted activists in Linlithgow - and decided to stay on to \"mentor\" younger colleagues in parliamentary skills.",

      "byline": "Alistair Ross",

      "body": "<p>Our research, currently covering 18 of the London boroughs, suggests that there are at least two different problems regarding the supply of teachers, and that both need to be addressed through long-term strategic management, rather than short-termpalliatives such as mortgage relief or \"golden hellos\". </p> <p>For the last three years, we have been examining the demographic structure of London's teaching force, looking at the career patterns of teachers and the motivations that underly them. We've asked teachers whether they intend to stay in teaching, and, if so, whether they intend to stay in London; we've asked all those teachers leaving their jobs - whether for another teaching post or for a job outside teaching - why they left, and we have also been asking those starting new jobs where they have come from and why. In total, we have questioned some 12,500 teachers. And our questions have uncovered problems that have been developing for nearly two decades. </p> <p>In the mid 1980s, something happened: London schools began to recruit fewer teachers who would spend their entire careers in the city, or teachers in their early 30s began to leave London, or teaching, or both. Either way, the proportion of London teachers in their 30s began to fall, and is still falling. </p> <p>The result is that, in London, there are now two distinct populations of teachers. Forty per cent are under 35 and most of these intend to stop teaching in London within the next five years. Fifty per cent are over 40, and most of these will stay teaching in London until they retire in their mid- to late-50s. This mixture of young transient teachers - who are either temporary visitors from overseas, or young teachers who spend a few years at the beginning of their career in the capital - and long-term London teachers - who know the local community and its needs well - worked well while the two elements were in balance. But now the balance has gone. </p> <p>The group of older, long-term London teachers is rapidly declining in size as retirement takes its toll, and London schools are having to try to recruit an ever-larger number of newly qualified teachers to make up the shortfall. But our data confirms the anecdotal evidence from headteachers and others that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find enough young teachers to replace those who move on. </p> <p>Teacher shortages are not just an English phenomenon - they are also happening in our \"traditional\" recruiting grounds of Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Fewer young teachers trained outside London are willing to take up their first posts in London. The Teacher Training Agency is trying harder than ever to attract new recruits, but even with the new incentives of training salaries for PGCE students, it is an uphill task. The numbers recruited in this current year are slightly up, but past experience suggests that incentives such as this only work for a year or two before numbers begin to decline again. </p> <p>The second problem is hidden: it concerns the retention of teachers in mid-career. The young teachers who might have stayed in London rapidly find that when they want to put down roots, with the not unreasonable desire of a professional to own their own home, that house prices are beyond them. Teaching posts are found in all populated areas (unlike almost any other large profession), so it's not difficult to move to a place where one can find both a job and affordable accommodation. </p> <p>Again, the government is trying - there are new schemes to provide affordable mortgages in London - but the problem is large, and there is a backlog to make up. </p> <p>Losing experienced teachers means that schools lack teachers with the experience to apply for positions of middle management and leadership. Our evidence shows that the real pinch in terms of the number of applications per post, and the success rate in making appointments, is in posts of responsibility, deputy headships and headships for schools. There's a huge dip in the number of teachers between 35 and 45, the very age group from whom these posts tend to be recruited. And in five years' time, as teachers currently in their 50s retire, that population dip will be of teachers between 35 and 50, and there will be even fewer applicants for headteacher posts. A further five years on, and by 2010 London schools will find it extraordinarily difficult to appoint heads, deputies and middle management. </p> <p>We have based our projections on what teachers say they intend to do. But even if only half of these intentions translate into action, there is very real cause for concern, and our monitoring of the actual numbers leaving teaching over the past two years suggests that those who say that they will leave the profession or the capital within five years usually do so. </p> <p>It is predominantly teachers under 30 who are on the move - out of teaching, or out of London. These young teachers can only be replaced by more young teachers - if they can be found - because there are only tiny numbers who can be attracted to teach in London in mid-career. </p> <p>Only one-tenth of London's young teachers intend to stay teaching in London for the rest of their careers. Older teachers are much more settled in London, but even so, only half of them think that they will see out their working lives as London teachers. </p> <p>But why do teachers leave teaching? This is a national trend, and our evidence suggests that the experience of Bob Hewitt, who wrote in Guardian Education on January 9 about why he was quitting teaching, is typical: \"Initiative and resourcefulness are banned\". </p> <p>We asked those who were leaving for other careers what it was that they saw as attractive in their new work. </p> <p>Three-fifths of all teachers taking up work outside the profession do not find that teaching allows them to be creative and resourceful. These factors used to be one of the key defining elements of the teaching profession: people joined the profession because it used to offer them autonomy, creativity and the ability to use one's initiative. </p> <p>What has happened to the profession that has caused these teachers, at least, to become so disillusioned that they seek alternative careers? This question, to teachers, is rhetorical. The ways in which teaching has become managed, has become \"accountable\" and has been subjected to control and direction, have contributed to demotivation. </p> <p>We have also found that for teachers leaving the profession, it isn't high alternative salaries that are attracting them out. Of our sample of teachers leaving for other careers, only 27% would be earning more than they earned as teachers; 27% said that they would earn the same as they had earned as in their previous teaching post; and 45% were going to posts paying less than they had earned in their last teaching post. </p> <p>It is the change in the nature of teaching that is behind the crisis points we have described. Pay is an issue: to enable teachers to stay in the profession, particularly in the areas of high housing costs, substantially more pay is needed. But more pay alone is not bringing new people into training and the profession in sufficient numbers. And more pay is not stopping the haemorrhage of teachers from the profession. </p> <p>Is this just a phenomenon of London and the south-east? This is certainly the region where shortages and threatened four-day weeks are making headlines. But our research suggests that the underlying problem -the twin peaks of the younger, short-term teachers, and the ageing peak of the longer-term teachers that we found in London is also found across England and Wales as a whole.

      "bodyText": "Our research, currently covering 18 of the London boroughs, suggests that there are at least two different problems regarding the supply of teachers, and that both need to be addressed through long-term strategic management, rather than short-termpalliatives such as mortgage relief or \"golden hellos\". For the last three years, we have been examining the demographic structure of London's teaching force, looking at the career patterns of teachers and the motivations that underly them. We've asked teachers whether they intend to stay in teaching, and, if so, whether they intend to stay in London; we've asked all those teachers leaving their jobs - whether for another teaching post or for a job outside teaching - why they left, and we have also been asking those starting new jobs where they have come from and why. In total, we have questioned some 12,500 teachers. And our questions have uncovered problems that have been developing for nearly two decades. In the mid 1980s, something happened: London schools began to recruit fewer teachers who would spend their entire careers in the city, or teachers in their early 30s began to leave London, or teaching, or both. Either way, the proportion of London teachers in their 30s began to fall, and is still falling. The result is that, in London, there are now two distinct populations of teachers. Forty per cent are under 35 and most of these intend to stop teaching in London within the next five years. Fifty per cent are over 40, and most of these will stay teaching in London until they retire in their mid- to late-50s. This mixture of young transient teachers - who are either temporary visitors from overseas, or young teachers who spend a few years at the beginning of their career in the capital - and long-term London teachers - who know the local community and its needs well - worked well while the two elements were in balance. But now the balance has gone. The group of older, long-term London teachers is rapidly declining in size as retirement takes its toll, and London schools are having to try to recruit an ever-larger number of newly qualified teachers to make up the shortfall. But our data confirms the anecdotal evidence from headteachers and others that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find enough young teachers to replace those who move on. Teacher shortages are not just an English phenomenon - they are also happening in our \"traditional\" recruiting grounds of Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Fewer young teachers trained outside London are willing to take up their first posts in London. The Teacher Training Agency is trying harder than ever to attract new recruits, but even with the new incentives of training salaries for PGCE students, it is an uphill task. The numbers recruited in this current year are slightly up, but past experience suggests that incentives such as this only work for a year or two before numbers begin to decline again. The second problem is hidden: it concerns the retention of teachers in mid-career. The young teachers who might have stayed in London rapidly find that when they want to put down roots, with the not unreasonable desire of a professional to own their own home, that house prices are beyond them. Teaching posts are found in all populated areas (unlike almost any other large profession), so it's not difficult to move to a place where one can find both a job and affordable accommodation. Again, the government is trying - there are new schemes to provide affordable mortgages in London - but the problem is large, and there is a backlog to make up. Losing experienced teachers means that schools lack teachers with the experience to apply for positions of middle management and leadership. Our evidence shows that the real pinch in terms of the number of applications per post, and the success rate in making appointments, is in posts of responsibility, deputy headships and headships for schools. There's a huge dip in the number of teachers between 35 and 45, the very age group from whom these posts tend to be recruited. And in five years' time, as teachers currently in their 50s retire, that population dip will be of teachers between 35 and 50, and there will be even fewer applicants for headteacher posts. A further five years on, and by 2010 London schools will find it extraordinarily difficult to appoint heads, deputies and middle management. We have based our projections on what teachers say they intend to do. But even if only half of these intentions translate into action, there is very real cause for concern, and our monitoring of the actual numbers leaving teaching over the past two years suggests that those who say that they will leave the profession or the capital within five years usually do so. It is predominantly teachers under 30 who are on the move - out of teaching, or out of London. These young teachers can only be replaced by more young teachers - if they can be found - because there are only tiny numbers who can be attracted to teach in London in mid-career. Only one-tenth of London's young teachers intend to stay teaching in London for the rest of their careers. Older teachers are much more settled in London, but even so, only half of them think that they will see out their working lives as London teachers. But why do teachers leave teaching? This is a national trend, and our evidence suggests that the experience of Bob Hewitt, who wrote in Guardian Education on January 9 about why he was quitting teaching, is typical: \"Initiative and resourcefulness are banned\". We asked those who were leaving for other careers what it was that they saw as attractive in their new work. Three-fifths of all teachers taking up work outside the profession do not find that teaching allows them to be creative and resourceful. These factors used to be one of the key defining elements of the teaching profession: people joined the profession because it used to offer them autonomy, creativity and the ability to use one's initiative. What has happened to the profession that has caused these teachers, at least, to become so disillusioned that they seek alternative careers? This question, to teachers, is rhetorical. The ways in which teaching has become managed, has become \"accountable\" and has been subjected to control and direction, have contributed to demotivation. We have also found that for teachers leaving the profession, it isn't high alternative salaries that are attracting them out. Of our sample of teachers leaving for other careers, only 27% would be earning more than they earned as teachers; 27% said that they would earn the same as they had earned as in their previous teaching post; and 45% were going to posts paying less than they had earned in their last teaching post. It is the change in the nature of teaching that is behind the crisis points we have described. Pay is an issue: to enable teachers to stay in the profession, particularly in the areas of high housing costs, substantially more pay is needed. But more pay alone is not bringing new people into training and the profession in sufficient numbers. And more pay is not stopping the haemorrhage of teachers from the profession. Is this just a phenomenon of London and the south-east? This is certainly the region where shortages and threatened four-day weeks are making headlines. But our research suggests that the underlying problem -the twin peaks of the younger, short-term teachers, and the ageing peak of the longer-term teachers that we found in London is also found across England and Wales as a whole. Fifty three per cent of all teachers are \"older\" (over 42). In the 10 years starting in 2005, we will see 41.4% of all current teachers retiring. Someone should be having sleepless nights over this: but the fact that this critical period lies in the next parliament but one means that this is a problem that can be conveniently forgotten by the present generation of ministers and civil servants. \u0095 Professor Alistair Ross is director of the Institute for Policy Studies in Education (IPSE).

The funding comes in response to a new action plan developed by the national taskforce on violence against social care staff, which outlines measures to protect social care staff. All 21,000 social care employers across England are being sent a copy of the taskforce's report, A Safer Place, on how to reduce the risk of staff being attacked by violent patients and clients. The \u00a32m will be administered by the National Training Organisation for Social Care (TOPSS) and used to improve training and qualifications across the social care workforce. A study of violence conducted in 1999 by the National Institute of Social Work (NISW) found that almost half the 2,000 social care staff interviewed had been verbally abused in the previous year, almost a fifth threatened and one in eight physically attacked. The national taskforce on violence against social care staff was set up in September 1999 by former health secretary Frank Dobson after the murder of south London social worker Jenny Morrison. Low morale and fears about violent attacks are causing many people to leave the sector and have contributed to a serious recruitment crisis, particularly among social workers. Health minister John Hutton said: \"Violence, threats and abuse to staff is unacceptable. \"The government is determined to improve the safety of social care workers and volunteers who often face violence and abuse while at work. \"We should not and will not tolerate it - accepting violence is not part of the job.\" He added: \"The threat of violence causes fear and anxiety to many social care workers, puts many people off from working in the social care field, and makes others leave to work somewhere else.\" Chris Davies, chairman of the task force, said: \"We dedicate our work to all of our colleagues who have been abused, assaulted and killed in the course of seeking to follow a caring profession. \"We cannot rest content while workers in those occupations which provide the closet personal care and help for people are those who are most often abused.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong>MAKING EXECUTIVE DECISIONS, THE KENNY DALGLISH WAY</strong></p> <p>Find yourself a company who will offer you a large sum of money for a role with an extremely vague job description. Like Director of golf at Celtic Football Club, for example. Install a man with no experience into one of the most high-profile and difficult posts in your industry. Leave said rookie - let's call him John Barnes - alone to make all the vital decisions while you have a few rounds (of golf). Watch things go totally tits up: perhaps Celtic lose at home against Inverness CT in the Scottish Cup, perhaps the fans are humiliated, perhaps John gets sacked and perhaps you, after winning a tribunal for unfair dismissal, get a cheque for \u00a3620,000.</p> <p>Now for the difficult part: justifying your highly-paid actions. Firstly distance yourself from the loser you employed. Say something along the lines of: \"It was John who signed all the players at Celtic. I don't know who was the worst although there were more bad ones than good ones.\" That should work, but in case of emergencies, keep something like this up your sleeve: \"Obviously there was some consultation between us but, at the end of the day, the guy who is responsible for who plays [and] how we played is ultimately responsible for buying players.\"</p> <p>By now, you should have distanced yourself from the worst of it, rendering your young charge almost totally unemployable. But it's always nice to chuck in the odd platitude, like: \"John had the best start to a season of any Celtic manager other than Jock Stein, although Martin has now surpassed that.\" However, if the entire world sees through your desperate story, remember that the best executives know to hide in their bunker when the heat is on. An extended golfing holiday it is, then.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>FROM THE ITALIAN RADIO TIMES</strong></p> <p>All channels: The New Adventures of Silvio Berlusconi (8pm, repeated at 9pm, 10pm, 11pm, etc.)</p> <p>From the team that brought you Silvio and the Resignation of the Italian National Coach (winner of the Golden Knob of Montrose) come seven new episodes of cheeky antics from everyone's favourite right-wing media magnate and owner of AC Milan.</p> <p>1: Silvio and the well-edited video footage</p> <p>Faithful journalists from Silvio's hit show Studio Aperto take a video camera to Milan nightclub Torqueville. They get great pictures of stars from AC Milan, Roma and Juventus cavorting on the dance floor the night after Serie A action. But when they get back to the studio - oh lordy lordy - only players from Serie A leaders Roma are visible! And only a week after Roma coach Fabio Capello told them to behave themselves off the pitch! What will Studio Aperto do? (Here's a hint, Silvio fans: they broadcast the footage during primetime on Silvio's Italia 1 channel!)</p> <p>See if you can spot a special cameo by Silvio himself, cheekily shrugging his shoulders as criticism pours down on him from all sides!</p> <p>What the critics said: \"I spent less than one hour in that place. I couldn't sleep, so I went out with some team-mates to have a beer. I joked about with Andriy Shevchenko while I was there - that's it\" - Well-known liar Gabriel Batistuta</p> <p>\"They were 'stolen images' that a freelance offered to us. They were recorded with a mini-camera. We thought it would be nice to show what the Roma squad were doing despite Capello's warning\" - Intrepid Studio Aperto spokesman</p> <p>Silvio a-go-go!</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"The game in England is physical and there is a lack of preparation. It is as though teams are making things up as they go along. There is clearly movement in English football, but it is only in a vertical direction\" - Christian Karembeu has had time to consider his views on the English game. Like when he goes walkabout for Boro, for example.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>RAIN MAN</strong></p> <p>When you're struggling knee-deep in the relegation mire, it doesn't just rain, it pours. And things are getting so wet round Coventry way, that you couldn't blame Wee Gord Strachan for going to bed in galoshes. He's been booed by the fans, lambasted by Cedric Roussell (\"This is the way they reward me for my loyalty,\" the two-goal striker said of Cov's failed attempts to flog him to Wimbledon), and now even his family have turned on him.</p> <p>Kind of. \"My family don't come to the games any more,\" Wee Gord told the official Coventry City website. \"My wife felt better when I was a player because at least I was on the field and could do something about it when things were going wrong. I don't think she feels great when I am isolated out there.\" One way of easing this problem of course would be to appoint Mrs Strachan as Director of Football.

      "bodyText": "MAKING EXECUTIVE DECISIONS, THE KENNY DALGLISH WAY Find yourself a company who will offer you a large sum of money for a role with an extremely vague job description. Like Director of golf at Celtic Football Club, for example. Install a man with no experience into one of the most high-profile and difficult posts in your industry. Leave said rookie - let's call him John Barnes - alone to make all the vital decisions while you have a few rounds (of golf). Watch things go totally tits up: perhaps Celtic lose at home against Inverness CT in the Scottish Cup, perhaps the fans are humiliated, perhaps John gets sacked and perhaps you, after winning a tribunal for unfair dismissal, get a cheque for \u00a3620,000. Now for the difficult part: justifying your highly-paid actions. Firstly distance yourself from the loser you employed. Say something along the lines of: \"It was John who signed all the players at Celtic. I don't know who was the worst although there were more bad ones than good ones.\" That should work, but in case of emergencies, keep something like this up your sleeve: \"Obviously there was some consultation between us but, at the end of the day, the guy who is responsible for who plays [and] how we played is ultimately responsible for buying players.\" By now, you should have distanced yourself from the worst of it, rendering your young charge almost totally unemployable. But it's always nice to chuck in the odd platitude, like: \"John had the best start to a season of any Celtic manager other than Jock Stein, although Martin has now surpassed that.\" However, if the entire world sees through your desperate story, remember that the best executives know to hide in their bunker when the heat is on. An extended golfing holiday it is, then. * * * * * * * * * * * * * FROM THE ITALIAN RADIO TIMES All channels: The New Adventures of Silvio Berlusconi (8pm, repeated at 9pm, 10pm, 11pm, etc.) From the team that brought you Silvio and the Resignation of the Italian National Coach (winner of the Golden Knob of Montrose) come seven new episodes of cheeky antics from everyone's favourite right-wing media magnate and owner of AC Milan. 1: Silvio and the well-edited video footage Faithful journalists from Silvio's hit show Studio Aperto take a video camera to Milan nightclub Torqueville. They get great pictures of stars from AC Milan, Roma and Juventus cavorting on the dance floor the night after Serie A action. But when they get back to the studio - oh lordy lordy - only players from Serie A leaders Roma are visible! And only a week after Roma coach Fabio Capello told them to behave themselves off the pitch! What will Studio Aperto do? (Here's a hint, Silvio fans: they broadcast the footage during primetime on Silvio's Italia 1 channel!) See if you can spot a special cameo by Silvio himself, cheekily shrugging his shoulders as criticism pours down on him from all sides! What the critics said: \"I spent less than one hour in that place. I couldn't sleep, so I went out with some team-mates to have a beer. I joked about with Andriy Shevchenko while I was there - that's it\" - Well-known liar Gabriel Batistuta \"They were 'stolen images' that a freelance offered to us. They were recorded with a mini-camera. We thought it would be nice to show what the Roma squad were doing despite Capello's warning\" - Intrepid Studio Aperto spokesman Silvio a-go-go! * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"The game in England is physical and there is a lack of preparation. It is as though teams are making things up as they go along. There is clearly movement in English football, but it is only in a vertical direction\" - Christian Karembeu has had time to consider his views on the English game. Like when he goes walkabout for Boro, for example. * * * * * * * * * * * * * RAIN MAN When you're struggling knee-deep in the relegation mire, it doesn't just rain, it pours. And things are getting so wet round Coventry way, that you couldn't blame Wee Gord Strachan for going to bed in galoshes. He's been booed by the fans, lambasted by Cedric Roussell (\"This is the way they reward me for my loyalty,\" the two-goal striker said of Cov's failed attempts to flog him to Wimbledon), and now even his family have turned on him. Kind of. \"My family don't come to the games any more,\" Wee Gord told the official Coventry City website. \"My wife felt better when I was a player because at least I was on the field and could do something about it when things were going wrong. I don't think she feels great when I am isolated out there.\" One way of easing this problem of course would be to appoint Mrs Strachan as Director of Football. Something we hope Wee Gord will suggest to the Cov board. Meanwhile, Strachan will have been comforted by the news that at least former skipper and longtime pal Gary McAllister is on his side. \"Fans do get restless when things aren't going well but I can assure each and every one of them that no-one puts in more than Gordon\", he said. More what, exactly? Anyway, as if to rub it in, Gord's day ended with the news that this afternoon Coventry's FA Youth Cup replay at Crewe has been postponed due to a waterlogged pitch. As we said, it doesn't just rain * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Bradford striker Stanley Collymore has been linked with a move to Atletico Madrid. Martin O'Neill has denied reports that Henrik Larsson will be leaving Celtic for Manchester United in a \u00a315m deal. \"That is the biggest lot of nonsense I have heard in a very, very long time,\" said O'Neill. Sylvain Wiltord has confirmed he is happy at Arsenal, despite reports linking him with a move to Paris St Germain. \"I like Arsenal and I'm not going to leave, especially after getting a few more chances in the starting line-up,\" he said. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Tottenham have admitted an interest in Southampton's Moroccan international Hassan Kachloul. Spurs director of football David Pleat said: \"He is one of several players whose situations we are monitoring.\" Bayern Munich striker Alexander Zickler has been approached by Liverpool. \"It's a great honour for me,\" the 26-year-old German international said after training with Bayern on Tuesday. \"The first talks will take place at the end of the week.\" David James has agreed to sign a new three-and-a-half-year contract with Aston Villa after being assured that the club could fulfil his ambitions in the game. Tony Adams is set to sign a new Arsenal contract to keep him at Highbury for two more years. Aston Villa today announced a loss before tax of \u00a32.6m for the six months up to November 30 last year. Chairman Doug Ellis admitted the latest figures were not helped by gate receipts and commercial revenue being reduced due to the demolition and reconstruction of the Trinity Road stand. Arsenal should escape expulsion from the FA Cup or a Premiership points deduction if their Lithuanian striker Tomas Danilevicius is expelled from Britain for carrying a false passport. A FA spokesman said Arsenal could only be punished if it was proven they knew Danilevicius had entered the country on a false Greek passport after signing from FC Lausanne. Fulham have signed Danish international striker Peter Moller Neilsen on loan from Real Oviedo until the end of the season. Huddersfield manager Lou Macari will face a FA hearing on February 13 following his sending-off against Portsmouth in December for an alleged push on the fourth official. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: Football Extra (3.15am) [stomp, whack, clang] Channel 4: Football Italia (1.10am) What's the meaning of all this effing noise?

The BBC would be better off starting with a fresh brief if it thinks its culture has changed,\" said Rita Clifton, chief executive of Interbrand - the consultancy which transformed ICI into Zeneca and is currently advising Marks &amp; Spencer. The design industry has reacted with surprise at the news today that BBC1 controller Lorraine Heggessey is unhappy with the balloon ID. Martin Lambie-Nairn, founder of the Lambie-Nairn consultancy, which created the ID in 1996, was not willing to comment. Ms Clifton said British institutions constantly agonised about how to tackle the inherent tension between appearing both \"big\" and \"friendly\". \"Companies like British Airways and BT have wrestled with this for years. On the one hand they want stature, grace and distinction - such as provided by the BBC balloon - and yet there's always a requirement to be warm and friendly. It's so difficult to be a cuddly colussus.\" She believes this is best tackled by starting afresh. \"The balloon is a powerful symbol but the arrival of Greg Dyke has signalled both change and energy. The BBC now needs to research its staff and customers about its new culture and start again.\" However, Ms Clifton warns: \"The strongest brands find truth within their organisations. External communications and presentation must reflect the BBC's true character. The public isn't stupid.\"",

      "body": "<p>Boris Becker having sex with a Russian woman in a broom cupboard in a Japanese restaurant is an unlikely story to begin with. For the woman, Angela Ermakowa, to claim she now has his love child (apparently backed up by genetic testing) is even more extraordinary. </p> <p>But if you're wondering what the odds are of getting pregnant from one act of sex, don't bother. Becker is telling the media he didn't have sex with Angela at all. His lawyers allege that Angela targeted Becker, stealing his sperm and inseminating herself to have his baby. The plan, apparently involving the Russian Mafia, was to blackmail Becker over his \"love child\". </p> <p>The case raises a few basic biology questions aside from how Angela hid her mouth full of semen. Their goodbyes must have been limited to nods. But can sperm live for any time outside the vagina? Could they survive being given a saliva bath by the mouth? And if you then inseminate these traumatised sperm, do they have it in them to battle through the hostile female reproductive tract to find their egg? </p> <p>In fact, sperm can be inseminated (using fingers or more sophisticated syringes) from anywhere they've been deposited outside the vagina. \"Its possible for a woman to become pregnant with sperm inseminated into the vagina that's been ejaculated outside,\" says Dr Steve Brody, of the Advanced Fertility Institute of San Diego. \"When sperm is ejaculated it's a gel-like, viscous substance. Within five to 15 minutes it liquifies. This gel phase is probably a mechanism to protect the sperm cells in the initial phase of ejaculation. No one knows for sure why it comes out like this. It's only after it liquifies that it really becomes mobile.\" </p> <p>There is some variation with the liquefaction; sperm can take 30 minutes to get going. According to Dr Brody, sperm in a test tube is still moving between 8 and 24 hours after a sample has been given. Sperm held in the mouth will not be damaged as long as it's protected in its gel-like form. \"If you check sperm in the vagina two hours after intercourse then most of them are immobilised,\" says Dr Brody. \"They've lost their gel protection. The vagina is acid and semen is alkaline so maybe that's also why they have this coating.\" </p> <p>Remarkably few sperm are actually produced with each ejaculation. There's usually 2-6 millilitres (about one half to a teaspoon), which contains between 200-300 million sperm and a mixture of sugar, protein, vitamin C, zinc and prostaglandins (the latter help the sperm travel through the womb). The sperm only make up 5% of the volume. And as anyone dieting will tell you, it's low in calories - just five per teaspoonful. </p> <p>Immature sperm cells are present in baby boys but need the surge in hormones at puberty to grow into big sperm. Men make millions of sperm effortlessly a day. This is because a sperm's life is perilous and short. Many try to make babies but few succeed. Maybe only 20 of those millions get even close to meeting their egg. </p> <p>They have to journey up through the vagina, through the womb and into the fallopian tubes that lead to the egg (if there is one, since it's a once-monthly event from the ovaries). Despite most sperm being paralysed by their protective gel, some are mobile as soon as they've landed. Studies show the early sperm reach the fallopian tubes in five minutes, with most of the others getting there by 45 minutes. </p> <p>\"It may be the sperm that get in right away that have the most chance of fertilising the egg,\" says Dr Brody. \"A study in rabbits shows that if you destroy all the sperm in the vagina within five minutes the rabbit still gets pregnant.\" Humans, of course, don't breed like rabbits. In fact if, as Becker claims, Angela planned to get pregnant, she was incredibly lucky to do so from one lot of sperm. Even a healthy 18-year-old couple, says Dr Brody, only have a 24% chance of getting pregnant from having sex once. Ever wondered why there are so many rats these days? Their equivalent pregnancy rate is 90%. </p> <p>And if this was a plan to produce another baby Becker, Angela (who at 33 has considerably reduced fertility compared with an 18 year old) would have had to know when she was ovulating. Preferably she would have read the recent research paper in the New England Journal that revolutionised current thinking on fertility. </p> <p>Traditionally the most fertile period was said to be the day the egg is released (ovulation which occurs around the 14th or 15th day of the menstrual cycle) and the next day. But this latest research shows it's the day before and the day of ovulation that are the most fertile. An egg only lives for about a day but sperm can be sniffing around far longer. \"You can find sperm around 85 hours after they've been ejaculated,\" says Dr Brody. \"It's possible for a woman to get pregnant from having sex six days before she ovulates.\" </p> <p>While paternity is easy to decide, it may be impossible to prove whether Becker did have sexual intercourse with Ermakowa. Becker's lawyers may argue that Ermakowa stole his sperm to fertilise herself, which could put a whole new spin on the act of ejaculation. Rather than being freely given will men start asking for their sperm back (saying it was only a loan)? Like Bill Clinton, Becker may rue his misconception that oral equals safe sex.</p>",

His speech is reasonable but he doesn't speak much and seems to live in a world of his own. He started nursery recently which I was hoping would make him more sociable, but the nursery teachers say he plays on his own and gets very upset if interrupted.

I am very worried about this and don't know the long-term implications. Does it mean I will find it hard to get pregnant? Will it cause me increased risk of cancer of the ovaries? How can I get more information? </p> <p> <strong>Answer</strong></p> <p>One third of UK women are estimated to have polycystic ovaries, which means that there are 10 or more cysts on each ovary. One third of women with these ovarian cysts also have symptoms such as unwanted facial hair, acne, erratic periods and particular difficulty losing excess weight. The ovarian cysts together with the symptoms are known as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). You are at increased risk of diabetes because resistance to the effects of insulin is part and parcel of PCOS. </p> <p>As far as I know, there's no increased risk of ovarian cancer. For most women, it is dealing with the symptoms which is most important. Erratic or absent periods may become a major concern when you're trying to get pregnant. Losing excess weight often helps many of the symptoms and helps to prevent diabetes. </p> <p>The drug Metformin, which is used to treat diabetes, can aid weight loss if all else fails. Clomid can kick-start your ovaries into action if they remain sluggish. The oral contraceptive pill may help control excess hair and avoid osteoporosis. Most women with PCOS never know they've got it and get pregnant without any trouble. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.verity-pcos.org.uk  \">PCOS self-help group</a>: Verity 52-54 Featherstone Street, London EC1Y 8RT.</p> <p><strong> Is football crazy?</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Question</strong></p> <p> I'm a 48-year-old, rather unfit and tubby man.

The Guardian Media Group has licensed its Manchester Metro title to Daily Mail owner Associated Newspapers after months of behind-the-scenes negotiations. It ends a brief circulation war between the two parties, which saw the Manchester Metro competing with Associated's News North West. \"Clearly the free newspaper market has been a great success in London, but there is not enough room for two free titles in the same city, so it's a logical decision,\" said Ian Ashcroft, chief executive of GMG regional newspapers. The Manchester Metro newspaper will now close and the new title will launch on February 12 with a circulation of 110,000. Under the deal GMG will run the local advertising sales operation while DMGT will supply editorial and maintain control of national advertising. GMG already has a strong hold in Manchester thanks to its ownership of the Manchester Evening News and 30 weekly newspapers in the Greater Manchester area. \"We have said for a while that we found it hard to believe that two free newspapers could be supported in any city the size of Manchester,\" said Peter Williams, finance director at parent company Daily Mail &amp; General Trust. \"It will be the equivalent of our London and Birmingham Metros, and joins the Metro club.\" Associated publishes Metro in London, Birmingham, Newcastle, Leeds, Sheffield, Glasgow and Edinburgh, although today's deal could signal the limit of its ambitions. \"This concept does not work everywhere.

Yes. Gotta have it.' In fact, the reaction was great from everyone,\" Martin Lambie-Nairn told the Radio Times.</p> <p>At first the balloon films were restricted to just 10 of Britain's most famous landmarks including Eilean Donan Castle in Scotland, the Giant's Causeway in Antrim and Canary Wharf.</p> <p>Now there are more than 30 locations including the Millennium Dome, the New Severn Bridge, Blackpool Tower, and industrial sites such as Felixtowe container port, Suffolk.</p> <p>And to mark Christmas a special Santa Claus version was designed. </p> <p>The image of the red and orange globe balloon rising above the lakeside castle in Eilean Donan has proved the most popular image with viewers.</p> <p>\"The way it is shot is different from other channel identities.

      "bodyText": "Lorraine Heggessey's decision to scrap the hot air balloon so soon after it was introduced will surprise many, not least the head of presentation at the BBC. Just four weeks ago he told how warm the public's response to the balloon had been. \"It's been tremenduously popular,\" he said. \"We're happy to continue with it, but we're looking for witty, warmer ways of updating it,\" said Peter Robertson, chief assistant, broadcasting and presentation, who has monitored the public's response. Also in for a shock will be design consultants Lambie-Nairn, who were charged with overhauling BBC1's rather remote image underlined by the spinning globe ident that popped up between programmes. The globe had been inspired by BBC1's first image back in 1963 when it chose to emphasise its position as one of the world's most prestigious broadcasting organisations with a globe. At first it was black and white and it changed to colour in 1969. But in 1996 director of television Alan Yentob explained it was time to move on again. \"The globe has always been associated with the BBC flagship channel and the choice of a balloon seemed an imaginative way of emphasising the universal appeal of BBC1,\" Mr Yentob said at the time. And just four weeks ago the enthusiasm for the balloon films seemed as strong as ever. \"It was one of those rare occaasions when the client just says, 'Absolutely. Yes. Gotta have it.' In fact, the reaction was great from everyone,\" Martin Lambie-Nairn told the Radio Times. At first the balloon films were restricted to just 10 of Britain's most famous landmarks including Eilean Donan Castle in Scotland, the Giant's Causeway in Antrim and Canary Wharf. Now there are more than 30 locations including the Millennium Dome, the New Severn Bridge, Blackpool Tower, and industrial sites such as Felixtowe container port, Suffolk. And to mark Christmas a special Santa Claus version was designed. The image of the red and orange globe balloon rising above the lakeside castle in Eilean Donan has proved the most popular image with viewers. \"The way it is shot is different from other channel identities. Other channels employ quick cuts and logos and it's all very fast, but this is calm,\" said Mr Lambie Nairn in an interview with the Radio Times at Christmas. \"It shows you can grab people's attention by being silent, just as you can by shouting at them.\"",

      "bodyText": "The driver of the train in the Hatfield rail crash was not to blame, a second interim report into the accident disclosed today. The report, from the Health and Safety Executive, found that: \"some flaws were evident in the operation of the driver training scheme\" as the train's driver was a trainee with seven weeks experience, although he was accompanied by a fully-qualified supervisor. The report said that according to GNER's training regime, a trainee should not have been in control of a train at high speed. However, the HSE added that the driver was under close supervision, and there was \"no evidence that these circumstances contributed in any way to the cause of the derailment\". The report also disclosed that a section of rail at the crash site broke into more than 300 pieces. A painstaking reconstruction of the fragments showed that there were multiple pre-existing cracks at or near the surface of the rail. A visual examination of the fragmented section of rail also showed that there was extensive flaking of metal, or spalling, the report said. The cracks in the rail were examples of the track fatigue phenomenon known as \"gauge corner cracking\", or what the HSE described as \"rolling contact fatigue\". Railtrack uses ultrasonic methods to inspect rail defects. However, the HSE report said: \"These techniques do not appear to have been developed specifically for the detection of rolling contact fatigue cracks.\" The HSE said an independent testing expert has been involved in reviewing Railtrack's current ultrasonic procedures, guided by the finding of the Hatfield investigation. The report said Railtrack had overall responsibility for the track, while the maintenance on this section was supplied by engineering contractor Balfour Beatty. Before the derailment there were proposals to renew the length of rail in question, and the most recent visual inspection of the rail was during the week prior to the derailment. Railtrack's standard contract with Balfour Beatty included the provision, if necessary, of speed restrictions. However, there were no speed restrictions in place at the time of the accident. Senior Railtrack and Balfour Beatty executives could face manslaughter charges over the Hatfield crash, it emerged at the weekend. The HSE said in today's report: \"Subject to there being sufficient evidence, a prosecution will be considered under the Health and Safety at Work Act. \"But if there is evidence of criminal negligence, the Crown Prosecution Service will first be asked by British Transport Police to consider a charge of manslaughter.\" Four people died and 70 were injured in the accident, which happened when a London to Leeds GNER express train, travelling at around 115-117mph, derailed just south of Hatfield on October 17 last year. The train was carrying 170 passengers and 12 GNER staff. The four who died, plus the two people most seriously injured, were all in the buffet car, which became uncoupled from the carriage behind, overturned, then collided with at least two overhead power line masts. Another carriage also became uncoupled, and the report said the failure of the two couplers \"may have contributed to the secondary vehicle collisions and overall vehicle instability\". The report said: \"All the evidence points to the derailment having been caused by fracture and subsequent fragmentation of a rail between Welham Green and Hatfield on a right-hand curve.\" The report also found there was nothing wrong with the train or the signals, and no evidence of vandalism. Today's report followed an initial interim report published just three days after the accident. A full, final HSE report will be published later this year.

BBC1 controller Lorraine Heggessey says the balloon which flies over more than 30 British landmarks including Tower Bridge and Canary Wharf in London is \"irrelevant\". \"To be honest, the balloon to me feels very slow; it goes across this majestic landscape but doesn't feel in touch with the viewers,\" she said. And it will surprise many who believe the calming sight of the balloon rising from some of Britain's most scenic spots has become a viewers' favourite. Just four weeks ago, the BBC's Radio Times reported how popular the balloon was, and even invited readers to write in if they had any ideas for new locations for the balloon films. The balloon was introduced in October 1997, when the BBC decided to axe the spinning globe which flashed up between programmes and replace it with the \"friendlier\" image of the red and yellow hot air ballon. The move sparked protests because the BBC was forking out more than \u00a35m to introduce the logo and new lettering for its buildings, vehicles, magazines, notepaper and merchandising. Filming the balloon alone cost \u00a3500,000. At the time critics slammed the BBC for spending money on make-overs too frequently - the spinning globe existed for just seven years. In today's Independent Ms Heggessey, who was appointed head of BBC1 last September, says she wants to give the station a harder image. She says she wants to transform the whole \"feel and tone\" of BBC1 and get away from the image of the corporation as a nannying force that knows what's best for viewers. \"I hate the word 'Auntie'.

      "body": "<p>This week marks a rare event in the career of Martin Amis: the release of a film based on one of his books. This is only the second time in almost 30 years of publishing that such an incident has come to pass. Back in 1975, Dead Babies was Amis's second novel, and now it has become the second Amis adaptation. \"Never second-guess the movies,\" he says, almost wearily. \"The only time you can be sure they're going to make a movie of your book is when the film has been out for a couple of weeks. Then it's definitely going to happen.\" </p> <p>At 51, Amis appears inured to the unenthusiastic reception that film-makers have given to his oeuvre. \"No,\" he says, \"I don't mind. I've noticed some of my writer friends have been taken up - but it's not a frontline concern. You're just making trouble for yourself if you get too involved in all these things. Years ago, I wrote a script for The Rachel Papers. I wrote a script for Dead Babies, too. But now I wouldn't dream of writing a script from my own stuff.\" The script used in the new film was actually by William Marsh, who also directed. </p> <p>Amis is terrifyingly spry, sitting bolt upright in an armchair, and hardly moving except to take drags from the ever-smouldering cigarette. He doesn't seem to like having his picture taken, initially refusing to look directly into the camera lens. But after a little cajoling, he complies, sucking in his cheeks as he does so. Then he talks with self-conscious sonority - very slowly, in fully formed sentences. You can hear the punctuation: the semi-colons, the italics, the ellipses. </p> <p>\"I used to say to myself, 'It's a shame I haven't written a script of my own,' \" Amis continues. \"Ian McEwan is pretty disillusioned with writing movies - but he had a wonderful start with The Ploughman's Lunch, where he and Richard Eyre bloody well got it through pretty much in accordance with how he imagined it. That's still an appealing thing: if you really saw eye to eye with a director, and it was a written film. </p> <p>\"So often when you're watching a movie it's like being present at some desperate script conference. Someone's saying 'We could try this' - and by God they have tried it. Films are terribly underwritten. But if I had the chance to do it now, I don't know that I would, because I want to get on with the stuff I control.\" </p> <p>Of course, Amis has written directly for the screen, without ever achieving the chemistry that someone with his talent for dialogue might expect. His sci-fi thriller Saturn 3, which still surfaces occasionally on late-night TV, might have been an unholy embarrassment upon its release in 1980, but provided Amis with raw material for his epic movie-industry novel Money. He says now: \"It just seemed to me that when I was working on that film I was head-doctoring and kissing ass, and writing these characters as they saw themselves, as they idealised themselves.\" Performers Kirk Douglas, Farrah Fawcett and Harvey Keitel re-emerged memorably as characters in Money: Lorne Guyland, Butch Beausoleil and Spunk Davis. </p> <p>Amis was later hired to work on an early incarnation of Mars Attacks! \"I wrote a good script too - the producer said it was 'too hip for the house'.\" That experience went into the short story Career Move, a brilliant satire of inversion in which poets command seven-figure fees and screenwriters labour over threadbare creations such as Offensive From Quasar 13. </p> <p>But cinema, and appreciation of it, is a skein that runs through all of Amis's work. Even at the start of his novel-writing, Amis has his Rachel Papers protagonist Charles Highway discourse elegantly on European cinema (\"Of course, there are plenty of sound, even urgent reasons for hating French films ... yet I preferred the more rickety and personal conventions ... the more radical attitude to experience, the scrutiny of the single detail and the small moment.\") </p> <p>Film pieces make up a good proportion of Amis's journalism: a hilarious account of Brian De Palma making Body Double in 1984; a nervous audience with Roman Polanski just after the director absconded from the US; a wander around the Houston set of Robocop 2 in 1990; venturing with his chum Salman Rushdie to a suburban multiplex to note the \"class betrayal\" of \"400 berks from Hendon\" in their reaction to Four Weddings and a Funeral; a brilliant exegesis of the habits and influence of screen violence for the New Yorker in the wake of the James Bulger murder. </p> <p>Through his film journalism you get the sense of a mind fully at ease with cinema, able to understand both the skittering hysteria of its transnational glamour, as well as its function as the repository of a global unconscious. Amis, alone among British writers, really gets the movies. </p> <p>Part of this assuredly stems from an early immersion: as a 13-year-old, Amis was offered a role in the Alexander Mackendrick film A High Wind in Jamaica, a four-month outing that got him expelled from school and ended up as an entertaining few paragraphs in yet another article, an account of a trip to the 1977 Cannes film festival. </p> <p>\"Even at that age,\" he recalls, \"I realised that I had no talent for what I was doing, that I had an anti-talent. A friend of mine said I looked as though I was being heavily bribed to do everything. Anthony Quinn had great force of life, but he was ridiculous. James Coburn was very cool. Alexander Mackendrick, the director, it was impressive to watch him work. But it made me realise how laborious film-making was. I stand by my definition in the Robocop piece: a series of repetitions punctuated by delays. That's movies.\" </p> <p> But Amis, whose radical critical intelligence operates brilliantly whether he is genuflecting before Saul Bellow or accompanying Watford FC on a Chinese tour, remains an insightful, liberal critic. \"There's a line in my father's novel Take a Girl Like You, when he and his girlfriend are trying to decide what film to see, and the narrator says, 'If it were left to me, I would have gone for the most violent or horrific film available.' This was always my taste. There's no doubt that film has no rivals in creating a strong affect. It can really seize you. So action is a very natural thing for film to deal with - and violence. </p> <p>\"A funny thing happened in film in the late 1960s, when the self-policing Hollywood code was tacitly dispensed with, and suddenly auteurism was it - and violence. Auteurism did more to damage movie audiences than the advent of television. It halved profits. Violence is not what the public wants, and the industry has since realised that, and is much more market-driven - again - with the results that we see. </p> <p>\"Time and again, I've gone to see films that everyone says are great, like The Full Monty, Four Weddings, Billy Elliot ... Everyone says, 'Oh, they're so sweet, they've got a lot of charm', and all that, and I find myself ...\" He sighs, irritated. \"Well, it's so up your arse. It's so cute, pawky, simpery. I mean, nauseating. And I like the fact that this film bucks that trend.\" </p> <p>Oh yes, this film. Amis professes to really admire the movie of Dead Babies, saying that it's \"incredibly faithful\" to its source, and there's a \"wonderful energy\" about it. And yet unpardonable liberties have been taken with the time setting: the original story, a laborious, multi-character satire on the drug-addled decadence of the early 1970s, has been roughly yanked into the present day. It's a pity, because Amis is at his most engaging when thinking back three decades, to what informed his writing in his early 20s. </p> <p>\"The currents at work, that you felt threading through you then, were so different. It was pre-feminist, pre-inflation ... The ideas and the culture of the late 1960s and early 1970s were the culture and ideas you get when there is prosperity. You could live for 10 shillings a week in London; then suddenly there was inflation and a cup of tea cost 10 shillings, a bus fare cost 10 shillings. That had an incredibly sobering effect on everyone, which we see to this day: yuppiedom was born then. </p> <p>\"And the wild ideas - political and pharmaceutical - that were going around then had to be dispensed with as leisure-class fripperies. It's also strange to think how left it was: how left-wing, how politicised the culture was. I'm pleased Bill Marsh [who also plays Marvell] looked so much like Charles Manson because he was the dark underside of hippiedom. That was really what the novel was about.\" Amis pauses. \"You lying hippie,\" he says with relish. \"That's what Charles Grodin calls Jeff Bridges in the remake of King Kong.\" He's suitably tickled. </p> <p>\"Hippiedom had its great benefits,\" he continues, \"especially for me. Because of free love, which was terrific for about three or four years until women suddenly realised that it wasn't in their interests at all. But it was great for a bit - any man my age will tell you the same thing. You'd get off with girls that didn't fancy you - a rather eerie feeling. It wasn't that they liked you, but that there was so much pressure on them to be liberated. But there was always this edge to hippiedom: the 'Pigs out!' edge, the blood of Sharon Tate on the bedroom wall.\" </p> <p>Dead Babies remains Amis's most ambitious treatment of his hippie prince past - but the movie adaptation, with its limited release, is unlikely to set the box office on fire. It's a Hollywood truism that bad books make good movies; maybe Amis's work is simply too delicately brilliant to survive the film industry meat-grinder. </p> <p>\u0095 Dead Babies is released on Friday.</p>",

But if I had the chance to do it now, I don't know that I would, because I want to get on with the stuff I control.\" Of course, Amis has written directly for the screen, without ever achieving the chemistry that someone with his talent for dialogue might expect. His sci-fi thriller Saturn 3, which still surfaces occasionally on late-night TV, might have been an unholy embarrassment upon its release in 1980, but provided Amis with raw material for his epic movie-industry novel Money. He says now: \"It just seemed to me that when I was working on that film I was head-doctoring and kissing ass, and writing these characters as they saw themselves, as they idealised themselves.\" Performers Kirk Douglas, Farrah Fawcett and Harvey Keitel re-emerged memorably as characters in Money: Lorne Guyland, Butch Beausoleil and Spunk Davis. Amis was later hired to work on an early incarnation of Mars Attacks! \"I wrote a good script too - the producer said it was 'too hip for the house'.\" That experience went into the short story Career Move, a brilliant satire of inversion in which poets command seven-figure fees and screenwriters labour over threadbare creations such as Offensive From Quasar 13. But cinema, and appreciation of it, is a skein that runs through all of Amis's work. Even at the start of his novel-writing, Amis has his Rachel Papers protagonist Charles Highway discourse elegantly on European cinema (\"Of course, there are plenty of sound, even urgent reasons for hating French films ... yet I preferred the more rickety and personal conventions ... the more radical attitude to experience, the scrutiny of the single detail and the small moment.\") Film pieces make up a good proportion of Amis's journalism: a hilarious account of Brian De Palma making Body Double in 1984; a nervous audience with Roman Polanski just after the director absconded from the US; a wander around the Houston set of Robocop 2 in 1990; venturing with his chum Salman Rushdie to a suburban multiplex to note the \"class betrayal\" of \"400 berks from Hendon\" in their reaction to Four Weddings and a Funeral; a brilliant exegesis of the habits and influence of screen violence for the New Yorker in the wake of the James Bulger murder. Through his film journalism you get the sense of a mind fully at ease with cinema, able to understand both the skittering hysteria of its transnational glamour, as well as its function as the repository of a global unconscious. Amis, alone among British writers, really gets the movies. Part of this assuredly stems from an early immersion: as a 13-year-old, Amis was offered a role in the Alexander Mackendrick film A High Wind in Jamaica, a four-month outing that got him expelled from school and ended up as an entertaining few paragraphs in yet another article, an account of a trip to the 1977 Cannes film festival. \"Even at that age,\" he recalls, \"I realised that I had no talent for what I was doing, that I had an anti-talent. A friend of mine said I looked as though I was being heavily bribed to do everything. Anthony Quinn had great force of life, but he was ridiculous. James Coburn was very cool. Alexander Mackendrick, the director, it was impressive to watch him work. But it made me realise how laborious film-making was. I stand by my definition in the Robocop piece: a series of repetitions punctuated by delays. That's movies.\" But Amis, whose radical critical intelligence operates brilliantly whether he is genuflecting before Saul Bellow or accompanying Watford FC on a Chinese tour, remains an insightful, liberal critic. \"There's a line in my father's novel Take a Girl Like You, when he and his girlfriend are trying to decide what film to see, and the narrator says, 'If it were left to me, I would have gone for the most violent or horrific film available.' This was always my taste. There's no doubt that film has no rivals in creating a strong affect. It can really seize you. So action is a very natural thing for film to deal with - and violence. \"A funny thing happened in film in the late 1960s, when the self-policing Hollywood code was tacitly dispensed with, and suddenly auteurism was it - and violence. Auteurism did more to damage movie audiences than the advent of television. It halved profits. Violence is not what the public wants, and the industry has since realised that, and is much more market-driven - again - with the results that we see. \"Time and again, I've gone to see films that everyone says are great, like The Full Monty, Four Weddings, Billy Elliot ... Everyone says, 'Oh, they're so sweet, they've got a lot of charm', and all that, and I find myself ...\" He sighs, irritated. \"Well, it's so up your arse. It's so cute, pawky, simpery. I mean, nauseating. And I like the fact that this film bucks that trend.\" Oh yes, this film. Amis professes to really admire the movie of Dead Babies, saying that it's \"incredibly faithful\" to its source, and there's a \"wonderful energy\" about it. And yet unpardonable liberties have been taken with the time setting: the original story, a laborious, multi-character satire on the drug-addled decadence of the early 1970s, has been roughly yanked into the present day. It's a pity, because Amis is at his most engaging when thinking back three decades, to what informed his writing in his early 20s. \"The currents at work, that you felt threading through you then, were so different. It was pre-feminist, pre-inflation ... The ideas and the culture of the late 1960s and early 1970s were the culture and ideas you get when there is prosperity. You could live for 10 shillings a week in London; then suddenly there was inflation and a cup of tea cost 10 shillings, a bus fare cost 10 shillings. That had an incredibly sobering effect on everyone, which we see to this day: yuppiedom was born then. \"And the wild ideas - political and pharmaceutical - that were going around then had to be dispensed with as leisure-class fripperies. It's also strange to think how left it was: how left-wing, how politicised the culture was. I'm pleased Bill Marsh [who also plays Marvell] looked so much like Charles Manson because he was the dark underside of hippiedom. That was really what the novel was about.\" Amis pauses. \"You lying hippie,\" he says with relish. \"That's what Charles Grodin calls Jeff Bridges in the remake of King Kong.\" He's suitably tickled. \"Hippiedom had its great benefits,\" he continues, \"especially for me. Because of free love, which was terrific for about three or four years until women suddenly realised that it wasn't in their interests at all. But it was great for a bit - any man my age will tell you the same thing. You'd get off with girls that didn't fancy you - a rather eerie feeling. It wasn't that they liked you, but that there was so much pressure on them to be liberated. But there was always this edge to hippiedom: the 'Pigs out!' edge, the blood of Sharon Tate on the bedroom wall.\" Dead Babies remains Amis's most ambitious treatment of his hippie prince past - but the movie adaptation, with its limited release, is unlikely to set the box office on fire. It's a Hollywood truism that bad books make good movies; maybe Amis's work is simply too delicately brilliant to survive the film industry meat-grinder. \u0095 Dead Babies is released on Friday.",

Earlier reports today suggested that the Department of Culture had struck a deal with the Treasury to allow free entry for museums and galleries in England. However, the Treasury denied that it had made a deal, and the Department of Culture, which would subsidise the institutions, said a \u00a31 entry fee would still be introduced in September. One of the government's long standing commitments has been to introduce free admission to museums and galleries for everyone. But the plans, contained in Labour's 1997 manifesto, ran into trouble when it emerged that Treasury rules meant some of these institutions would lose out financially if the scheme was introduced. By not charging entrance fees museums would lose their status as businesses and therefore would no longer be able to reclaim VAT. So a compromise, called Quids In, was reached between the Treasury and the Department of Culture which would subsidise institutions while allowing them to charge a nominal \u00a31 fee in order to avoid VAT. This morning's reports had suggested that the Treasury would allow museums and galleries to reclaim VAT with or without the entry fee. But not all museums and galleries have signed up to the \u00a31 scheme. The institutions' trustees must agree to the changes - and some fear it is a short-term solution that could be rendered obsolete when the VAT rules are reviewed in 2002.

Labour MPs on the standing committee of the health and social care bill voted down a joint Liberal Democrat and Conservative attempt to reprieve the medical practices committee (MPC). The MPC, a Department of Health committee, had lobbied hard against its abolition arguing that it would herald a chaotic, free-for-all approach to GP distribution. But health minister John Denham said that removing the MPC and devolving responsibility for ensuring fair GP distribution to local health authorities would allow \"under-doctored\" areas in the north of England and in inner cities to benefit. \"Enabling development of resource allocation in the way that I have described will make it easier for areas that lack doctors to attract them,\" he said.

But there were also tacky movies: Cat Women Of The Moon (1953), in which she led telepathic lunar women in black tights; Abbott And Costello Meet The Mummy (1955), as a campy crook called Madame Rontru; Swamp Women (1956), about female convicts in Louisiana, and as Josephine to Dennis Hopper's Napoleon in The Story Of Mankind (1957). In the 1960s, and 1970s, she guested on more than 200 TV shows, as well as continuing in movies, as an ageing vamp. Despite being crippled with arthritis in her later years, Windsor, politically on the right, was active in the Screen Actors Guild and the Motion Picture and Television Fund. She divorced bandleader Ted Steele, and is survived by her second husband, estate agent Jack Hupp, whom she married in 1954, and their son. \u0095 Marie Windsor (Emily Marie Bertelsen), actress, born December 11 1919; died December 10 2000.",

With President Saddam Hussein's regime in its 22nd year, and more than a decade since the start of the trade embargo, there is a need for escapist entertainment. The latest film to capture the public imagination is a movie by Abdul Salam al-Adhami, one of Iraq's most famous directors and actors, which is due for release this week. It is an epic about the Gulf war, one of a series of full-length feature films that the government has prepared for the 10th anniversary of the \"Um al-Mar'rik\" (Mother of All Battles), as the war to expel Iraq from Kuwait is known. Mr al-Adhami's film, which was shot in the desert using Iraqi soldiers as extras, tells the story of a unit of conscripts from Baghdad who are buried alive by allied troops during an attack by the US-led forces. \"This is one of the most horrible war crimes of our time and it was carried out by American troops,\" he said. He added that he was inspired by a CNN documentary in which American soldiers admitted bulldozing trenches full of surrendering soldiers during the rapid advance into Kuwait. The film, called Hafr al-Batm after the area of desert where the massacre is alleged to have occurred, starts with a local bedouin who, after noticing how vultures gather over a certain patch of sand, investigates and unearths remains.

It meant Chris Tarrant's quiz show handed over 12.8m viewers to News at Ten. This was 7.7m more than BBC1's Ten O'Clock News inherited from Second Sight. As one senior BBC insider put it, News at Ten's victory could be put down to \"Millionaire, Millionaire, Millionaire and its inheritance\". An impressive 8.1m viewers stayed with News at Ten, giving the bulletin a 37% share of the audience. The size of the audience may also have been affected by the fact there was no advertising break between Who Wants to be a Millionaire? and News at Ten. Officially it occupied a 20-minute slot from 10pm, though in fact the 16-minute bulletin actually ran from 10.02pm to 10.18pm. The BBC1 Ten O'Clock News had a 4.3m audience between 10pm and 10.25pm. This was equivalent to one in five viewers over that period. But the BBC can argue that its bulletin lost fewer inherited viewers than its ITV rival. The Ten O'Clock News was only 1.1m down on Second Sight, while News at Ten ended up with 3.6m less viewers than Millionaire. Overall, nearly twice as many viewers watched the two late-night bulletins compared with last Monday. The combined audience for the two 10pm news shows last night was 12.4m. A week ago the Ten O'Clock News and ITV's 11pm Nightly News managed only 6.9m between them. Both sides stressed the 10pm news ratings battle is about the \"long term\", not just one night's audience figures. \"We're naturally pleased that so many viewers chose ITV News at Ten last night,\" an ITV spokeswoman said. \"But this is not about one night, ITV is committed to News at Ten for the long term.\" \"ITV News at Ten is clearly an attractive choice for viewers and we will continue to work with ITN to deliver high quality, authoritative news day in, day out.\" The BBC struck a similar note. \"We are in this for the long term,\" a BBC News spokesman said. \"We have always said that our Ten O'Clock News will be judged in the long term and on providing the best quality and most comprehensive news bulletin for viewers. \"On the basis of last night's bulletin, we believe we achieved that.\"",

By Monday, some 170,000 gallons (643,500 litres) of diesel fuel had poured from the disabled tanker. </p> <p>The government's emergency declaration was meant to allow for quick allocation of funds to help pay for the cleanup. </p> <p>On Monday evening, some 30 Galapagos national park employees in small motor boats began the slow task of skimming the water's surface around the tanker to clean slicks of diesel fuel. </p> <p>\"Our orders are to do this work until the zone is clean,\" said park employee Daniel Castro, standing in a boat near a patch of oily foam floating atop the water. </p> <p>But that small fleet could not address a larger problem. Experts were monitoring intermittent slicks within a 488-square-mile (1,250-squ km) area. Currents pushed the fuel to the south and - more alarmingly - west toward the bulk of islands in the volcanic Galapagos chain, a fragile ecosystem populated by animal and plant species found nowhere else in the world. </p> <p>The problem began on January 16, when the Ecuadorean tanker Jessica ran aground in pounding surf off San Cristobal Island, the easternmost island in the Galapagos archipelago. The ship, which was carrying 243,000 gallons (some 1m litres) of diesel, started leaking fuel Friday as it tilted sharply. </p> <p>Ecuadorean environment minister Rodolfo Rendon said that some 60,000 gallons (227,118 litres) were recovered from the damaged tanker over the weekend, but not before some 170,000 gallons (643,500 litres) seeped through fissures in the ship's hull. </p> <p>A team of US coastguard specialists successfully recovered another 10,000 gallons (37,850 litres) of diesel fuel from inside the damaged tanker on Monday. They first pumped it into undamaged tanks aboard the 28-year-old ship, then transferred it to the another vessel, said Captain Ramiro Morejon, chief of control and marine monitoring for the Galapagos park. Only about 10,000 gallons (37,850 litres) were still left in the tanker. </p> <p>Galapagos national park spokesman Fabian Oviedo said on Monday that dispersants and absorbents were being used to lessen the impact of the diesel, but that the fuel had already reached Santa Fe Island, 37 miles (60 kms) west of San Cristobal. </p> <p>\"The part of Santa Fe most affected is the coastal zone of El Miedo, populated by iguanas, sea lions and birds, such as the blue-footed booby,\" he said. \"Four sea lions stained with diesel have been spotted, as well as boobies and 30 pelicans.\" </p> <p>He said most of the birds \"had been captured and were undergoing a process of cleaning with special detergents.\" He added that monitoring flights were being conducted over Santa Cruz, the next major island in the chain. </p> <p>Carlos Valle, coordinator of the World Wildlife Fund's Galapagos programme in Ecuador, said the damage could be grave for the hundreds of sea lions and thousands of iguanas that populate Santa Fe. </p> <p>\"It is very difficult to move them because they are very territorial,\" he said. \"The most vulnerable animals are the blue-footed boobies, masked boobies and frigate birds whose feeding zone is in the area of the spill.\" </p> <p>He said some colonies of marine turtles could be threatened. But species in danger of extinction, such as the miniature Galapagos penguin and flightless cormorant, are not in danger because they live in the far western reaches of the archipelago. </p> <p>The giant land tortoises, which can reach 550 pounds (250 kgs) and for which the Galapagos are named, were not in danger because they live in the higher elevations of the islands. </p> <p>Police on San Cristobal said no charges had been filed against the ship's captain, Tarquino Arevalo, or against his company, Acotramar. But Ecuadorean President Gustavo Noboa has demanded a report on the cause of the accident. </p> <p>Capt Morejon said the spill could have been avoided. \"Looking at the navigation chart, in which a signal buoy was mistaken for a lighthouse, the accident was definitely caused by human error,\" he said. </p> <p><strong>Talk about it</strong><br><a href=\"http://talk.guardianunlimited.co.uk/WebX?13@@.ee7e650\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><strong>Graphic</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/graphic/0,5812,426481,00.html\">Guide to the disaster</a></p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,426603,00.html\">23.01.01: Birthplace of the evolution</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/netnotes/article/0,6729,426491,00.html\">22.01.01:NetNotes: the story in links</a></p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www3.satnet.net/caam\">Ecuador environmental advisory commission (in Spanish)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.gct.org\">Galapagos Conservation Trust (UK charity)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.uscg.mil/hq/nsfcc/nsfweb\">US Coastguard National Strike Force</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.unesco.org/whc/nwhc/pages/sites/s_8a2.htm\">Unesco information on the Galapagos</a></p>",

The managing director of IPC Music &amp; Sport, Mike Soutar, confirmed that Mr Perry had tendered his resignation, but said he was in discussions with him to persuade him to stay on at the magazine.

The encounter took place in Paris, where Pound had a studio, and Lewis, impassive beneath his trademark wide black hat, seemed content to watch in silence. \"Ezra had not been boxing very long and I was embarrassed at having him work in front of anyone he knew, and I tried to make him look as good as possible,\" Hemingway wrote. So wide was the margin between master and pupil, both in musculature and in technique, that Hemingway could without difficulty refrain from doing his opponent any damage. Lewis, he felt sure, wanted to see Pound hurt. He was careful not to oblige. \"I never countered but kept Ezra moving after me sticking out his left hand and throwing a few right hands and then said we were through and washed down with a pitcher of water and towelled off and put on my sweatshirt.\"</p> <p>What is startling about Hemingway's recollection of the event, in his Paris memoir, A Moveable Feast (1964), is the way in which it uses all this washing-down and towelling-off as the basis for an assault on Lewis's character. Hemingway remembers himself as clean, above all; and clean, furthermore, after his carefully controlled exertions, in a thoroughly modern way. Lewis, on the other hand, wearing the kind of bohemian 'uniform' favoured by the 'prewar artist', remains somehow archaic and insalubrious. \"Walking home I tried to think what he reminded me of and there were various things. They were all medical except toe-jam.\" Lewis is dirt, then, or an abortion. \"Under the black hat, when I had first seen them, the eyes had been those of an unsuccessful rapist.\" There might presumably have been some hope for Lewis had his eyes merely been those of a successful rapist.</p> <p>Lewis describes his visit to Pound's Paris studio in the first of his two volumes of autobiography, Blasting and Bombardiering (1937). No one answered his knock, but the door was open, so he went in.</p> <p>A splendidly built young man, stripped to the waist, and with a torso of dazzling white, was standing not far from me. He was tall, handsome and serene, and was repelling with his boxing gloves a hectic assault of Ezra's. After a final swing at the dazzling solar plexus Pound fell back upon his settee. The young man was Hemingway. Pound got on like a house on fire with this particular statue.</p> <p>By comparison with Hemingway's, Lewis's description of the event is coolness itself. It does subtle damage to Hemingway by not discerning in him the agency or control over events his undeniable physical superiority might be thought to have generated. By this account, it is Pound, rather than Hemingway, who brings the bout to a conclusion; and he does so by falling back on a settee - a fixture not ordinarily available in the average gymnasium for the use of wobbly punters. Statuesque or supine, neither protagonist is left with much of a leg to stand on.</p> <p>And yet there is in the description's coolness a certain residual heat. The stance Lewis favoured was not in fact one of detachment. He liked to get up close, in the world's face. Immediacy mattered to him, and a vivid trace often survives in his writing of the impulse that gave rise to it. Here, for example, he makes no effort to avoid the clich\u00e9 of the house on fire. The clich\u00e9 is his first thought about Pound's fondness for Hemingway, we are allowed to think, and the first thought will do. It will do, however, not just because it fills space, but because its familiarity in general terms is also its diagnostic value in this particular context: Pound merits a clich\u00e9 because he has become a clich\u00e9, a walking susceptibility. Such fusions of impulse and diagnosis are the hallmark of Lewis's writing at its best. They also got him into a lot of trouble.</p> <p>Paul O'Keeffe's new Life of Lewis does not hold back on the toe-jam. Some Sort of Genius is, among other things, a compendium of the many reasons people found to dislike its subject. Lewis became, sometimes by circumstance, sometimes by design, the sponsor of a wide range of opportunities for fear and loathing. Women were especially favoured in this respect. O'Keeffe observes that in all his relationships with women Lewis sought to present the image of a man with no attachments or encumbrances. The models available to him included his father, a swashbuckling veteran of the American Civil War who made a habit of infidelity and eventually left his wife for good in 1901, when Lewis was 18; and Augustus John, his celebrated predecessor at the Slade, whom he sought assiduously to emulate, and whose ever-varying seraglio became an object of fascination. But Lewis's presentation of himself to women, and to the men with whom he conferred about women, had a polemical edge to it, a toxicity entirely lacking, as far as one can tell, in John's sexual munificence. From an early age, Lewis cultivated what could be termed anti-pathos: a strategic, rather than merely tactical or opportunist, avoidance of sentiment. This strategy was to manifest itself in his art as a preference for the abstract, in his writing as a preference for satire and invective, and in his politics as a tough-mindedness shading almost imperceptibly into advocacy of tough action.</p> <p>One of the few testimonials that survive from Lewis's relationship with Iris Barry, with whom he lived from 1918 to 1921, is a telegram handed in to the Leicester Square Post Office at 3.35 p.m. on 1 June 1920: \"PLEASE PREPARE CHOP EIGHT - LEWIS.\" Barry used its reverse as a shopping list. As she cooked Lewis's steak and onions that night, she was also preparing the second of their two children. The pregnancy had been his idea, or so she claimed. She had been made to feel that a second child (the paternity of the first was in some doubt) would be irrefutable proof of her commitment to him. By early August, at any rate, Barry had installed herself in the Nursing Institute at Mitcham in South London. Lewis, however, was nowhere to be seen. \"The distance is very great,\" he complained, \"and you are awkward to get at.\" After all, he had a studio to find, and a patron for a new journal. Lonely, a little scared, and at a loss as to what to do about the imminent arrival, Barry pleaded with him at least to let her know where he was. He had already left London for a fortnight's holiday in France with TS Eliot.</p> <p>This holiday has since become a part of Modernist folklore. It was the occasion on which Eliot, at Pound's behest, delivered a parcel containing a pair of old brown shoes to a distinctly unappreciative James Joyce. The shoes apart, Eliot was having a good time. He considered Lewis the most profitable person he had had to talk to for a long time. In Saumur, Lewis fell off his bicycle, and was soon looking for someone to sue. When, appeased by a row with the proprietor of the cycle shop, he got back to Paris - Eliot was meanwhile on a tour of Gothic churches - he found Barry's letter waiting for him. Replying on 28 August, he said that he wasn't yet sure about his movements. He seems to have been in no great hurry to proceed to Mitcham. \"I don't suppose you will void your foetus for several weeks yet,\" he cajoled; he would make arrangements about the child on his return. The harshness is clearly a demonstration, a performance, albeit one in which it is hard to tell the dancer from the dance. A telegram dispatched the same day was more encouraging. Lewis told Barry not to worry, and sent his love. Maisie Wyndham was born on 1 September. Neither parent was to have much to do with her upbringing.</p> <p>If having sex with Lewis seems to have been a thankless task, then lending him money was about as much fun as amputation. Sometimes the same person was required to fulfil both functions. Ida Vendel, the mistress acquired as a lifestyle accessory in Paris in April 1905, he thought of as his 'German allotment'. Ida's father had been a wealthy merchant, and Lewis was soon, and thereafter almost as a matter of policy, in debt to her. Indeed, the difficulty he found in extricating himself from the relationship had as much to do with its monetary as with its sexual arrangements, and he didn't really feel free of it until his mother had paid Ida what he owed her. Its termination, in the summer of 1907, meant that he now required alternative sources of revenue, as his friends and relations were soon to discover. \"He's a cool card with other people's money,\" Augustus John complained in January 1908: \"I don't know how much of mine he's calmly appropriated, without so much as a 'thank you'.\"</p> <p>The one thing even less likely to meet with gratitude than a loan was an outright gift. At the end of 1923, a group of well-wishers established a joint fund to provide Lewis with a stipend of \u00a316 a month for as long as he might remain in need of it. The result was the usual mayhem, as dark suspicions flourished, and lifelong friends fell out. On one occasion, a delay in the dispatch of the monthly cheque elicited an unforgiving response: \"WHERE'S THE FUCKING STIPEND? LEWIS.\" O'Keeffe dismisses this story as apocryphal, but he does not seem in much doubt as to the brutality with which Lewis often treated those who sought to help him. Earlier that year, Lewis had spent some time in France with one of the people who was to contribute generously to the fund, the painter Richard Wyndham. Sitting outside a caf\u00e9 in Toulon, he told Wyndham that he was a 'Narcissus' and probably a 'bugger'. People, Wyndham remembered him saying, are only friends insofar as they are of use to you. Lewis, it seems, did not so much bite the hand that fed him as mistake it for the main meal.</p> <p>The rehearsal of anti-pathos is not, of course, all there was to Lewis, even if his behaviour as a young man left room for little else. O'Keeffe provides evidence of what love meant to him, and friendship. He was capable of spontaneous acts of generosity, such as the unstinting support he offered Denis Williams, a 26-year-old Guyanese painter, in 1949-50. \"Rarely,\" O'Keeffe observes, \"did Lewis act in anybody's exclusive interest but his own.\" In this case, he did. He wrote admiringly about Williams's work, and found him a job at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in Southampton Row. By this time, he had also come across, and managed to hold onto, patrons he did not resent (the most notable being Sir Nicholas Waterhouse). Even so, the interest of Some Kind of Genius lies to a large extent in the ample evidence it provides of the deliberate cultivation in the life of tendencies which shape the art and the writing. Anti-pathos was not just the condition of Lewis's work as a writer and artist - its nourishment, so to speak - but one of its dominant qualities. The work is inconceivable without an understanding of the antagonisms which in its making fused impulse and diagnosis.</p> <p>O'Keeffe has written a book about conditions rather than qualities. Accordingly, it is hiatus, not productivity, that provides him with his raw material. He is never happier than when his subject can be manoeuvred into some sanctuary from the requirements of the creative act: a training-camp, say, or a dugout, or a hospital ward. All that matters, really, is that Lewis should be able to write a letter or two and still have enough energy left over to pick the kind of quarrel the victim was not likely to forget in a hurry. O'Keeffe's descriptions of Lewis's service as an artillery officer and battlefield artist during the first world war and his harrowing 'exile' in Canada during the second are exemplary. Fortunately for him, Lewis's failures to complete a book or a painting were often as titanic as the work whose production they impeded. O'Keeffe devotes many pages to the four years it took the War Artists' Advisory Committee to extract from Lewis the picture it had commissioned, on 10 June 1942, of the Anaconda American Brass Foundry near Toronto. No sooner had the Committee's long-suffering representative at last got the damn thing out of Lewis's Notting Hill studio and into a taxi than he asked for it back.</p> <p>O'Keeffe's emphasis on conditions rather than qualities looks like a deliberate choice. He has abstained throughout not only from assessment, but from anything other than the most cursory description of Lewis's work as an artist and writer. I can't remember reading a biography so utterly abstemious in critique and evaluation, so wary of the minor self-aggrandisements that accompany the biographer's possession of and by his or her subject. Most biographies amount to a celebration of the triumph of mind over matter. This one opens not beside the cradle, or at the distant root of some genealogical tree, but in a Pathology Museum, where the cross-section of its subject's brain, suspended in a jar, reveals \"a pituitary gland swollen to a solid ovoid mass, six centimetres in height and four centimetres from front to back and from side to side\". (As a result of this tumour, Lewis's sight began to fail in 1937; by 1950, he had gone blind.)</p> <p>If biography as a genre is on trial in Some Kind of Genius, so is the more or less routine mythologising of Modernism. O'Keeffe explodes a number of stories about Lewis which have been accepted as unimpeachable fact by previous biographers (that he was born on a yacht off the coast of Nova Scotia, that he had a child by Ida Vendel). More generally, he encourages a degree of scepticism about the distance some Modernist writers sought to put between their art and the constraints of everyday existence. TS Eliot, appearing momentarily but to electric effect, from the Mitcham point of view, as a recalcitrant partner's holiday companion, seems to have wandered in from a different movie altogether: the one in which, for many years now, he has gone about his official Modernist business of parcel delivery and meditation on ecclesiastical architecture. Paul Edwards begins Wyndham Lewis: Painter and Writer with the kind of sentence O'Keeffe has taken enormous trouble to avoid. \"This study,\" he declares, \"the first to cover comprehensively Wyndham Lewis's work in literature and painting, is written from a conviction that Lewis is of major importance in both fields.\" We can be in no doubt that the value of the work will be absolutely central in what follows.</p> <p>In fact, these two books complement one another uncannily, as though the authors, like the two campus novelists in David Lodge's Small World, had agreed to divide up the world between them. By secret treaty, as it were, O'Keeffe got to do facts, and Edwards opinions. The opinions, it should at once be said, are the fruit of immense dedication. Edwards has written widely about Lewis over the past twenty years, and is responsible for no less than six volumes in the invaluable Black Sparrow Press editions of the writings. The great and abiding virtue of his study is its patience. Lewis, the book proclaims on each of its 549 pages of text and sumptuous illustration, is finally to receive his due.</p> <p>Edwards needs to be patient, and versatile. For in his Modernist phase in particular, from around 1908 to around 1930, Lewis continually changed direction, sometimes in accordance with his understanding of the market, but more often prompted by an obstinate will to experiment. He sought to reinvent himself, to make himself new, by mutations of mode and emphasis. He switched from genre to genre and medium to medium, supplying the lack of a will to experiment in one from its over-abundance in another. In his Modernist phase, Lewis effectively became, for the purposes of literary and artistic revolution, a serial careerist.</p> <p>Lewis studied intermittently at the Slade from January 1899 until June 1901, when he finally engineered his own expulsion. He had begun writing verse, and his sonnets won the approval of the scholar and critic T Sturge Moore. The painters with whom he consorted - Walter Sickert, William Rothenstein, Augustus John - chose to regard him as a poet. \"The fine arts they imagined were already in good hands,\" he recalled in Rude Assignment (1950), his second volume of autobiography, \"namely their own.\" But it was as a writer of prose sketches that he first made his mark, when three pieces appeared in the English Review in May, June and August 1909. His literary career was thus one of several launched by the Review's perceptive editor, Ford Madox Ford (or Hueffer, as he then was). Lewis is said either to have thrust his bundle of manuscripts wordlessly into Hueffer's hands, or to have burst into the bathroom and read them aloud, while the editor sat in his tub, as O'Keeffe puts it, \"nonchalantly plying his sponge\". These sketches were the product of holidays in Brittany, where Lewis had found, or thought he had found, a culture whose ritualised antagonisms were a physical reflection of his own developing metaphysical commitment to anti-pathos. By August, it seems, the editor's charm had worn off. \"Hueffer,\" he explained to Moore, \"is a shit of the most dreary and uninteresting kind.\"</p> <p>At this stage, Lewis would have been more widely known as a writer than as an artist. However, the success of Roger Fry's first post-impressionist exhibition, in 1910, generated a flurry of experiment in the visual arts, and Lewis took up his brush again, to considerable effect. Within a year so, his work was sustaining comparison with that of major figures in the continental avant-garde. There followed, between 1913 and 1915, the period of his most intense commitment to geometrical abstraction. Blast appeared, Vorticism arose. During what he thought of as the 'Blast days', that heady period of Vorticist carnival brought to a halt, in his case, for a while at least, by the combined effects of gonorrhoea and officer training, Lewis trafficked assiduously between media. \"My literary contemporaries,\" he recalled in Rude Assignment, \"I looked upon as too bookish and not keeping pace with the visual revolution.\" He would show them the way in a novel, Tarr (1918), which was about as abstract as he could make it, though in the end not altogether un-bookish. In an original and highly instructive chapter, Edwards demonstrates the lengths to which Lewis went to keep abstraction going after the war. As he rightly insists, the paintings and drawings of the immediate postwar period offer a glimpse of what a critical English Modernism in dialogue with the European avant-garde might conceivably have looked like.</p> <p>Before and during the war, avant-gardists had made quite a splash, even in an England that relied for its excitements on the dreary and uninteresting Hueffer. After the war, however, Lewis's expectation that he might be able to emulate in England the success Picasso had achieved in France soon began to fade. He had always attributed his own relative lack of success to the deficiencies of the culture in which he found himself operating, and in 1924 he set art and literature aside in order to concentrate on a systematic analysis of those deficiencies. The neglect endured by genius in the modern world is a constant theme in books like The Art of Being Ruled (1926) and Time and Western Man (1927). The former attributes postwar revolutions in attitude and lifestyle to monopoly capitalism's insatiable appetite for markets; the latter examines the deepening connections between the emergence of a consumer society and developments in modern literature and philosophy. At their best, these books have the diagnostic value of the cultural criticism of Walter Benjamin or Siegfried Kracauer, with both of whom Lewis shared a fascination for Charlie Chaplin, if little else.</p> <p>When Edwards claims that Lewis's polemical writings constitute \"a permanent insight into the nature of modernity\", I'm very nearly ready to believe him. The reservation has to do with the trace in the arguments they mount of an impulse that might be regarded as mildly psychotic. Lewis meant The Art of Being Ruled as a survival guide, an antidote to Machiavelli. So intent was he on tough-mindedness, however, on a thorough-going decontamination of liberal pieties, that he came to regard the imminence of Fascist rule with an equanimity which could easily be (and was) mistaken for endorsement. Equally disturbing, in its way, is the chapter on Ezra Pound in Time and Western Man. Lewis begins by recalling the generosity and grace Pound had unfailingly shown towards him whenever he was in need of help. He then declares that for the purposes of his 'new enterprise' he must henceforth dissociate himself altogether from his former ally and benefactor, now exposed as a 'revolutionary simpleton' and a parasite on genuine talent. The critique, although by no means unperceptive, has an edge to it which derives in large part from the satisfaction Lewis so obviously took in not being grateful.</p> <p>In 1921 Lewis had embarked on another ambitious project, a Rabelaisian fictional anatomy of postwar Britain. Two hefty portions, held back for a while by his skirmishes with the spirit of Charlie Chaplin, finally and circuitously achieved publication at the end of the decade: The Childermass (1928), a work of theological science fiction set in an encampment of the dead on the banks of the River Styx; and The Apes of God (1930), a satire on amateurism in general, and Bloomsbury amateurism in particular, in which Richard Wyndham features as the vacuous Dick Whittingdon. Lewis also renovated his Vorticist creed by publishing a revised edition of Tarr, in 1928, and collecting his early Breton sketches and essays, in much-altered form, as The Wild Body (1927).</p> <p>Anti-pathos finds a name in these works: satire, laughter, the absurd. Laughter, Lewis explained in Inferior Religions, a scintillating essay which serves as a manifesto for The Wild Body, is the \"brain-body's snort of exultation\". Laughter at once acknowledges and expresses (or performs, since it is \"all that remains physical in the flash of thought\") the idea that the absurdity of the human condition is not relative - the product, sometimes comic, sometimes tragic, of social and cultural difference - but absolute. For Lewis, laughter is what being might look like from the point of view of non-being; and antagonism, which puts being at risk, is the primary cause of laughter. \"The opposing armies in the early days in Flanders stuck up dummy-men on poles for their enemies to pot at, in a spirit of ferocious banter.\" The fiction of the 1920s indefatigably keeps non-being's point of view in mind by means of a kind of prose impasto: a poultice or compress of descriptive detail applied to human existence in order to draw out its fundamental absurdity, its basis in antagonism. The main casualty of these convulsive literary mantraps is the idea of 'character' as a steadily deepening awareness of self and world. One might find a precedent for them in Rabelais, perhaps, or in that noted Vorticist firebrand, Charles Dickens. But Lewis's concoctions have a pungency all their own. The account in Bestre, one of the Wild Body stories, of a woman whose \"nodular pink veil\" is an \"apoplectic gristle\" round her stormy brow has stayed in my mind ever since I first read it thirty years ago.</p> <p>In November 1930 Lewis travelled to Berlin to find a German publisher for The Apes of God. Two months earlier, the German people had elected 107 National Socialists to the Reichstag. The National Socialist German Workers' Party could now claim 17.5 per cent of the total vote, second only to the Social Democrats' 21.9 per cent. Lewis watched from a balcony in the Berlin Sportpalast as Goebbels and Goering held forth to a crowd of twenty thousand. In the world's face, as ever, he also took in the lavish decadence of late Weimar democracy, checking for himself the stubble on the chins of the transvestites. On his return to London, unable to resist such an opportunity for diagnosis on a world-historical scale, he wrote the first study in any language of Adolf Hitler and the rise of National Socialism. His motive was to create tolerance in Britain for this latest Continental manifestation of authoritarian doctrine, and he therefore argued that Nazi anti-semitism was a mere sideshow, a \"racial red-herring\". The book brought him a visit from Dr Hans-Wilhelm Thost, English correspondent for the Vslkischer Beobachter and Der Angriff, and a spy, who thought it \"not at all bad for an Englishman\", but rather misleading where the Judenfrage was concerned. Its argument slung together pretty much at random, its jacket cheerfully festooned with swastikas, the book still haunts Lewis's reputation. It is, for example, the prime exhibit in John Carey's withering indictment of his life and work in The Intellectuals and the Masses (1992).</p> <p>Edwards discerns a \"new humanity and concern for ordinary people\" in Lewis's fiction and painting from 1935 onwards. The head-banging had to stop sometime, and it may have stopped during the series of operations Lewis underwent between 1932 and 1937, as an old gonorrhoeal scar in his bladder became infected (O'Keeffe has the details). Edwards sees in the return to portraiture after 1937, in novels like The Revenge for Love (1937) and Self Condemned (1954), sometimes regarded as Lewis's best, and in Monstre Gai and Malign Fiesta (1955), which resume The Childermass, a 'recognition of the experience of the other'. The later work, he says, constitutes a Kierkegaardian advance from aesthetics through ethics to theology. No doubt the imminence of mere death, as opposed to the vital deadness advertised by the Vorticist mantraps, had something to do with it.</p> <p>Edwards looks in great detail at the process of self-examination and the commitment to theological enquiry which give the later work a new and formidable gravity. The problem with this work, as he acknowledges, is that its agenda required it either to reject or to transform the principle of creative antagonism. Under taxing scrutiny, in Self Condemned or Malign Fiesta, the psychosis eventually dissolves, and with it a great deal else. \"Just as Lewis's drawing lost a certain kind of intensity when he began to recognise the inner reality of others,\" Edwards observes, \"so did his writing.\" In the writing, at least, the loss is absolute. The opening pages of Self Condemned would have been a rank embarrassment to the author of Inferior Religions. Edwards proves a subtle and informative guide to Lewis's deepening moral and spiritual preoccupations, and many readers will find his defence of the later work entirely persuasive. I didn't, quite, in the end, because a part of me wants to insist that wild bodies are what Lewis did best. It's the apoplectic gristle, stupid.</p> <p>Edwards's study deserves to remain for some time the standard point of reference in debates about the overall shape and status of Lewis's work, and it will have the entirely beneficial effect of diverting attention away from the over-emphasised 'Blast days'. Gristle-fanciers, however, may continue to find themselves drawn to The Wild Body and its like. In Inferior Religions, Lewis spoke of beauty as an \"icy douche\" of \"ease and happiness\" provoked by whatever suggests the perfect conditions for an organism. For Leonardo, he said, beauty was a \"red rain on the side of shadowed heads\", for Uccello it was a \"cold architecture of distinct colour\" and for Korin the \"symmetrical gushing\" of water. \"C\u00e9zanne liked cumbrous, democratic slabs of life, slightly leaning, transfixed in vegetable intensity.\" Of these, Lewis's own idea of beauty was closest to C\u00e9zanne's. Unlike C\u00e9zanne, however, he did the transfixing by anti-pathos. Whether or not it brought him much ease and happiness is hard to say.</p>",

The encounter took place in Paris, where Pound had a studio, and Lewis, impassive beneath his trademark wide black hat, seemed content to watch in silence. \"Ezra had not been boxing very long and I was embarrassed at having him work in front of anyone he knew, and I tried to make him look as good as possible,\" Hemingway wrote. So wide was the margin between master and pupil, both in musculature and in technique, that Hemingway could without difficulty refrain from doing his opponent any damage. Lewis, he felt sure, wanted to see Pound hurt. He was careful not to oblige. \"I never countered but kept Ezra moving after me sticking out his left hand and throwing a few right hands and then said we were through and washed down with a pitcher of water and towelled off and put on my sweatshirt.\" What is startling about Hemingway's recollection of the event, in his Paris memoir, A Moveable Feast (1964), is the way in which it uses all this washing-down and towelling-off as the basis for an assault on Lewis's character. Hemingway remembers himself as clean, above all; and clean, furthermore, after his carefully controlled exertions, in a thoroughly modern way. Lewis, on the other hand, wearing the kind of bohemian 'uniform' favoured by the 'prewar artist', remains somehow archaic and insalubrious. \"Walking home I tried to think what he reminded me of and there were various things. They were all medical except toe-jam.\" Lewis is dirt, then, or an abortion. \"Under the black hat, when I had first seen them, the eyes had been those of an unsuccessful rapist.\" There might presumably have been some hope for Lewis had his eyes merely been those of a successful rapist. Lewis describes his visit to Pound's Paris studio in the first of his two volumes of autobiography, Blasting and Bombardiering (1937). No one answered his knock, but the door was open, so he went in. A splendidly built young man, stripped to the waist, and with a torso of dazzling white, was standing not far from me. He was tall, handsome and serene, and was repelling with his boxing gloves a hectic assault of Ezra's. After a final swing at the dazzling solar plexus Pound fell back upon his settee. The young man was Hemingway. Pound got on like a house on fire with this particular statue. By comparison with Hemingway's, Lewis's description of the event is coolness itself. It does subtle damage to Hemingway by not discerning in him the agency or control over events his undeniable physical superiority might be thought to have generated. By this account, it is Pound, rather than Hemingway, who brings the bout to a conclusion; and he does so by falling back on a settee - a fixture not ordinarily available in the average gymnasium for the use of wobbly punters. Statuesque or supine, neither protagonist is left with much of a leg to stand on. And yet there is in the description's coolness a certain residual heat. The stance Lewis favoured was not in fact one of detachment. He liked to get up close, in the world's face. Immediacy mattered to him, and a vivid trace often survives in his writing of the impulse that gave rise to it. Here, for example, he makes no effort to avoid the clich\u00e9 of the house on fire. The clich\u00e9 is his first thought about Pound's fondness for Hemingway, we are allowed to think, and the first thought will do. It will do, however, not just because it fills space, but because its familiarity in general terms is also its diagnostic value in this particular context: Pound merits a clich\u00e9 because he has become a clich\u00e9, a walking susceptibility. Such fusions of impulse and diagnosis are the hallmark of Lewis's writing at its best. They also got him into a lot of trouble. Paul O'Keeffe's new Life of Lewis does not hold back on the toe-jam. Some Sort of Genius is, among other things, a compendium of the many reasons people found to dislike its subject. Lewis became, sometimes by circumstance, sometimes by design, the sponsor of a wide range of opportunities for fear and loathing. Women were especially favoured in this respect. O'Keeffe observes that in all his relationships with women Lewis sought to present the image of a man with no attachments or encumbrances. The models available to him included his father, a swashbuckling veteran of the American Civil War who made a habit of infidelity and eventually left his wife for good in 1901, when Lewis was 18; and Augustus John, his celebrated predecessor at the Slade, whom he sought assiduously to emulate, and whose ever-varying seraglio became an object of fascination. But Lewis's presentation of himself to women, and to the men with whom he conferred about women, had a polemical edge to it, a toxicity entirely lacking, as far as one can tell, in John's sexual munificence. From an early age, Lewis cultivated what could be termed anti-pathos: a strategic, rather than merely tactical or opportunist, avoidance of sentiment. This strategy was to manifest itself in his art as a preference for the abstract, in his writing as a preference for satire and invective, and in his politics as a tough-mindedness shading almost imperceptibly into advocacy of tough action. One of the few testimonials that survive from Lewis's relationship with Iris Barry, with whom he lived from 1918 to 1921, is a telegram handed in to the Leicester Square Post Office at 3.35 p.m. on 1 June 1920: \"PLEASE PREPARE CHOP EIGHT - LEWIS.\" Barry used its reverse as a shopping list. As she cooked Lewis's steak and onions that night, she was also preparing the second of their two children. The pregnancy had been his idea, or so she claimed. She had been made to feel that a second child (the paternity of the first was in some doubt) would be irrefutable proof of her commitment to him. By early August, at any rate, Barry had installed herself in the Nursing Institute at Mitcham in South London. Lewis, however, was nowhere to be seen. \"The distance is very great,\" he complained, \"and you are awkward to get at.\" After all, he had a studio to find, and a patron for a new journal. Lonely, a little scared, and at a loss as to what to do about the imminent arrival, Barry pleaded with him at least to let her know where he was. He had already left London for a fortnight's holiday in France with TS Eliot. This holiday has since become a part of Modernist folklore. It was the occasion on which Eliot, at Pound's behest, delivered a parcel containing a pair of old brown shoes to a distinctly unappreciative James Joyce. The shoes apart, Eliot was having a good time. He considered Lewis the most profitable person he had had to talk to for a long time. In Saumur, Lewis fell off his bicycle, and was soon looking for someone to sue. When, appeased by a row with the proprietor of the cycle shop, he got back to Paris - Eliot was meanwhile on a tour of Gothic churches - he found Barry's letter waiting for him. Replying on 28 August, he said that he wasn't yet sure about his movements. He seems to have been in no great hurry to proceed to Mitcham. \"I don't suppose you will void your foetus for several weeks yet,\" he cajoled; he would make arrangements about the child on his return. The harshness is clearly a demonstration, a performance, albeit one in which it is hard to tell the dancer from the dance. A telegram dispatched the same day was more encouraging. Lewis told Barry not to worry, and sent his love. Maisie Wyndham was born on 1 September. Neither parent was to have much to do with her upbringing. If having sex with Lewis seems to have been a thankless task, then lending him money was about as much fun as amputation. Sometimes the same person was required to fulfil both functions. Ida Vendel, the mistress acquired as a lifestyle accessory in Paris in April 1905, he thought of as his 'German allotment'. Ida's father had been a wealthy merchant, and Lewis was soon, and thereafter almost as a matter of policy, in debt to her. Indeed, the difficulty he found in extricating himself from the relationship had as much to do with its monetary as with its sexual arrangements, and he didn't really feel free of it until his mother had paid Ida what he owed her. Its termination, in the summer of 1907, meant that he now required alternative sources of revenue, as his friends and relations were soon to discover. \"He's a cool card with other people's money,\" Augustus John complained in January 1908: \"I don't know how much of mine he's calmly appropriated, without so much as a 'thank you'.\" The one thing even less likely to meet with gratitude than a loan was an outright gift. At the end of 1923, a group of well-wishers established a joint fund to provide Lewis with a stipend of \u00a316 a month for as long as he might remain in need of it. The result was the usual mayhem, as dark suspicions flourished, and lifelong friends fell out. On one occasion, a delay in the dispatch of the monthly cheque elicited an unforgiving response: \"WHERE'S THE FUCKING STIPEND? LEWIS.\" O'Keeffe dismisses this story as apocryphal, but he does not seem in much doubt as to the brutality with which Lewis often treated those who sought to help him. Earlier that year, Lewis had spent some time in France with one of the people who was to contribute generously to the fund, the painter Richard Wyndham. Sitting outside a caf\u00e9 in Toulon, he told Wyndham that he was a 'Narcissus' and probably a 'bugger'. People, Wyndham remembered him saying, are only friends insofar as they are of use to you. Lewis, it seems, did not so much bite the hand that fed him as mistake it for the main meal. The rehearsal of anti-pathos is not, of course, all there was to Lewis, even if his behaviour as a young man left room for little else. O'Keeffe provides evidence of what love meant to him, and friendship. He was capable of spontaneous acts of generosity, such as the unstinting support he offered Denis Williams, a 26-year-old Guyanese painter, in 1949-50. \"Rarely,\" O'Keeffe observes, \"did Lewis act in anybody's exclusive interest but his own.\" In this case, he did. He wrote admiringly about Williams's work, and found him a job at the Central School of Arts and Crafts in Southampton Row. By this time, he had also come across, and managed to hold onto, patrons he did not resent (the most notable being Sir Nicholas Waterhouse). Even so, the interest of Some Kind of Genius lies to a large extent in the ample evidence it provides of the deliberate cultivation in the life of tendencies which shape the art and the writing. Anti-pathos was not just the condition of Lewis's work as a writer and artist - its nourishment, so to speak - but one of its dominant qualities. The work is inconceivable without an understanding of the antagonisms which in its making fused impulse and diagnosis. O'Keeffe has written a book about conditions rather than qualities. Accordingly, it is hiatus, not productivity, that provides him with his raw material. He is never happier than when his subject can be manoeuvred into some sanctuary from the requirements of the creative act: a training-camp, say, or a dugout, or a hospital ward. All that matters, really, is that Lewis should be able to write a letter or two and still have enough energy left over to pick the kind of quarrel the victim was not likely to forget in a hurry. O'Keeffe's descriptions of Lewis's service as an artillery officer and battlefield artist during the first world war and his harrowing 'exile' in Canada during the second are exemplary. Fortunately for him, Lewis's failures to complete a book or a painting were often as titanic as the work whose production they impeded. O'Keeffe devotes many pages to the four years it took the War Artists' Advisory Committee to extract from Lewis the picture it had commissioned, on 10 June 1942, of the Anaconda American Brass Foundry near Toronto. No sooner had the Committee's long-suffering representative at last got the damn thing out of Lewis's Notting Hill studio and into a taxi than he asked for it back. O'Keeffe's emphasis on conditions rather than qualities looks like a deliberate choice. He has abstained throughout not only from assessment, but from anything other than the most cursory description of Lewis's work as an artist and writer. I can't remember reading a biography so utterly abstemious in critique and evaluation, so wary of the minor self-aggrandisements that accompany the biographer's possession of and by his or her subject. Most biographies amount to a celebration of the triumph of mind over matter. This one opens not beside the cradle, or at the distant root of some genealogical tree, but in a Pathology Museum, where the cross-section of its subject's brain, suspended in a jar, reveals \"a pituitary gland swollen to a solid ovoid mass, six centimetres in height and four centimetres from front to back and from side to side\". (As a result of this tumour, Lewis's sight began to fail in 1937; by 1950, he had gone blind.) If biography as a genre is on trial in Some Kind of Genius, so is the more or less routine mythologising of Modernism. O'Keeffe explodes a number of stories about Lewis which have been accepted as unimpeachable fact by previous biographers (that he was born on a yacht off the coast of Nova Scotia, that he had a child by Ida Vendel). More generally, he encourages a degree of scepticism about the distance some Modernist writers sought to put between their art and the constraints of everyday existence. TS Eliot, appearing momentarily but to electric effect, from the Mitcham point of view, as a recalcitrant partner's holiday companion, seems to have wandered in from a different movie altogether: the one in which, for many years now, he has gone about his official Modernist business of parcel delivery and meditation on ecclesiastical architecture. Paul Edwards begins Wyndham Lewis: Painter and Writer with the kind of sentence O'Keeffe has taken enormous trouble to avoid. \"This study,\" he declares, \"the first to cover comprehensively Wyndham Lewis's work in literature and painting, is written from a conviction that Lewis is of major importance in both fields.\" We can be in no doubt that the value of the work will be absolutely central in what follows. In fact, these two books complement one another uncannily, as though the authors, like the two campus novelists in David Lodge's Small World, had agreed to divide up the world between them. By secret treaty, as it were, O'Keeffe got to do facts, and Edwards opinions. The opinions, it should at once be said, are the fruit of immense dedication. Edwards has written widely about Lewis over the past twenty years, and is responsible for no less than six volumes in the invaluable Black Sparrow Press editions of the writings. The great and abiding virtue of his study is its patience. Lewis, the book proclaims on each of its 549 pages of text and sumptuous illustration, is finally to receive his due. Edwards needs to be patient, and versatile. For in his Modernist phase in particular, from around 1908 to around 1930, Lewis continually changed direction, sometimes in accordance with his understanding of the market, but more often prompted by an obstinate will to experiment. He sought to reinvent himself, to make himself new, by mutations of mode and emphasis. He switched from genre to genre and medium to medium, supplying the lack of a will to experiment in one from its over-abundance in another. In his Modernist phase, Lewis effectively became, for the purposes of literary and artistic revolution, a serial careerist. Lewis studied intermittently at the Slade from January 1899 until June 1901, when he finally engineered his own expulsion. He had begun writing verse, and his sonnets won the approval of the scholar and critic T Sturge Moore. The painters with whom he consorted - Walter Sickert, William Rothenstein, Augustus John - chose to regard him as a poet. \"The fine arts they imagined were already in good hands,\" he recalled in Rude Assignment (1950), his second volume of autobiography, \"namely their own.\" But it was as a writer of prose sketches that he first made his mark, when three pieces appeared in the English Review in May, June and August 1909. His literary career was thus one of several launched by the Review's perceptive editor, Ford Madox Ford (or Hueffer, as he then was). Lewis is said either to have thrust his bundle of manuscripts wordlessly into Hueffer's hands, or to have burst into the bathroom and read them aloud, while the editor sat in his tub, as O'Keeffe puts it, \"nonchalantly plying his sponge\". These sketches were the product of holidays in Brittany, where Lewis had found, or thought he had found, a culture whose ritualised antagonisms were a physical reflection of his own developing metaphysical commitment to anti-pathos. By August, it seems, the editor's charm had worn off. \"Hueffer,\" he explained to Moore, \"is a shit of the most dreary and uninteresting kind.\" At this stage, Lewis would have been more widely known as a writer than as an artist. However, the success of Roger Fry's first post-impressionist exhibition, in 1910, generated a flurry of experiment in the visual arts, and Lewis took up his brush again, to considerable effect. Within a year so, his work was sustaining comparison with that of major figures in the continental avant-garde. There followed, between 1913 and 1915, the period of his most intense commitment to geometrical abstraction. Blast appeared, Vorticism arose. During what he thought of as the 'Blast days', that heady period of Vorticist carnival brought to a halt, in his case, for a while at least, by the combined effects of gonorrhoea and officer training, Lewis trafficked assiduously between media. \"My literary contemporaries,\" he recalled in Rude Assignment, \"I looked upon as too bookish and not keeping pace with the visual revolution.\" He would show them the way in a novel, Tarr (1918), which was about as abstract as he could make it, though in the end not altogether un-bookish. In an original and highly instructive chapter, Edwards demonstrates the lengths to which Lewis went to keep abstraction going after the war. As he rightly insists, the paintings and drawings of the immediate postwar period offer a glimpse of what a critical English Modernism in dialogue with the European avant-garde might conceivably have looked like. Before and during the war, avant-gardists had made quite a splash, even in an England that relied for its excitements on the dreary and uninteresting Hueffer. After the war, however, Lewis's expectation that he might be able to emulate in England the success Picasso had achieved in France soon began to fade. He had always attributed his own relative lack of success to the deficiencies of the culture in which he found himself operating, and in 1924 he set art and literature aside in order to concentrate on a systematic analysis of those deficiencies. The neglect endured by genius in the modern world is a constant theme in books like The Art of Being Ruled (1926) and Time and Western Man (1927). The former attributes postwar revolutions in attitude and lifestyle to monopoly capitalism's insatiable appetite for markets; the latter examines the deepening connections between the emergence of a consumer society and developments in modern literature and philosophy. At their best, these books have the diagnostic value of the cultural criticism of Walter Benjamin or Siegfried Kracauer, with both of whom Lewis shared a fascination for Charlie Chaplin, if little else. When Edwards claims that Lewis's polemical writings constitute \"a permanent insight into the nature of modernity\", I'm very nearly ready to believe him. The reservation has to do with the trace in the arguments they mount of an impulse that might be regarded as mildly psychotic. Lewis meant The Art of Being Ruled as a survival guide, an antidote to Machiavelli. So intent was he on tough-mindedness, however, on a thorough-going decontamination of liberal pieties, that he came to regard the imminence of Fascist rule with an equanimity which could easily be (and was) mistaken for endorsement. Equally disturbing, in its way, is the chapter on Ezra Pound in Time and Western Man. Lewis begins by recalling the generosity and grace Pound had unfailingly shown towards him whenever he was in need of help. He then declares that for the purposes of his 'new enterprise' he must henceforth dissociate himself altogether from his former ally and benefactor, now exposed as a 'revolutionary simpleton' and a parasite on genuine talent. The critique, although by no means unperceptive, has an edge to it which derives in large part from the satisfaction Lewis so obviously took in not being grateful. In 1921 Lewis had embarked on another ambitious project, a Rabelaisian fictional anatomy of postwar Britain. Two hefty portions, held back for a while by his skirmishes with the spirit of Charlie Chaplin, finally and circuitously achieved publication at the end of the decade: The Childermass (1928), a work of theological science fiction set in an encampment of the dead on the banks of the River Styx; and The Apes of God (1930), a satire on amateurism in general, and Bloomsbury amateurism in particular, in which Richard Wyndham features as the vacuous Dick Whittingdon. Lewis also renovated his Vorticist creed by publishing a revised edition of Tarr, in 1928, and collecting his early Breton sketches and essays, in much-altered form, as The Wild Body (1927). Anti-pathos finds a name in these works: satire, laughter, the absurd. Laughter, Lewis explained in Inferior Religions, a scintillating essay which serves as a manifesto for The Wild Body, is the \"brain-body's snort of exultation\". Laughter at once acknowledges and expresses (or performs, since it is \"all that remains physical in the flash of thought\") the idea that the absurdity of the human condition is not relative - the product, sometimes comic, sometimes tragic, of social and cultural difference - but absolute. For Lewis, laughter is what being might look like from the point of view of non-being; and antagonism, which puts being at risk, is the primary cause of laughter. \"The opposing armies in the early days in Flanders stuck up dummy-men on poles for their enemies to pot at, in a spirit of ferocious banter.\" The fiction of the 1920s indefatigably keeps non-being's point of view in mind by means of a kind of prose impasto: a poultice or compress of descriptive detail applied to human existence in order to draw out its fundamental absurdity, its basis in antagonism. The main casualty of these convulsive literary mantraps is the idea of 'character' as a steadily deepening awareness of self and world. One might find a precedent for them in Rabelais, perhaps, or in that noted Vorticist firebrand, Charles Dickens. But Lewis's concoctions have a pungency all their own. The account in Bestre, one of the Wild Body stories, of a woman whose \"nodular pink veil\" is an \"apoplectic gristle\" round her stormy brow has stayed in my mind ever since I first read it thirty years ago. In November 1930 Lewis travelled to Berlin to find a German publisher for The Apes of God. Two months earlier, the German people had elected 107 National Socialists to the Reichstag. The National Socialist German Workers' Party could now claim 17.5 per cent of the total vote, second only to the Social Democrats' 21.9 per cent. Lewis watched from a balcony in the Berlin Sportpalast as Goebbels and Goering held forth to a crowd of twenty thousand. In the world's face, as ever, he also took in the lavish decadence of late Weimar democracy, checking for himself the stubble on the chins of the transvestites. On his return to London, unable to resist such an opportunity for diagnosis on a world-historical scale, he wrote the first study in any language of Adolf Hitler and the rise of National Socialism. His motive was to create tolerance in Britain for this latest Continental manifestation of authoritarian doctrine, and he therefore argued that Nazi anti-semitism was a mere sideshow, a \"racial red-herring\". The book brought him a visit from Dr Hans-Wilhelm Thost, English correspondent for the Vslkischer Beobachter and Der Angriff, and a spy, who thought it \"not at all bad for an Englishman\", but rather misleading where the Judenfrage was concerned. Its argument slung together pretty much at random, its jacket cheerfully festooned with swastikas, the book still haunts Lewis's reputation. It is, for example, the prime exhibit in John Carey's withering indictment of his life and work in The Intellectuals and the Masses (1992). Edwards discerns a \"new humanity and concern for ordinary people\" in Lewis's fiction and painting from 1935 onwards. The head-banging had to stop sometime, and it may have stopped during the series of operations Lewis underwent between 1932 and 1937, as an old gonorrhoeal scar in his bladder became infected (O'Keeffe has the details). Edwards sees in the return to portraiture after 1937, in novels like The Revenge for Love (1937) and Self Condemned (1954), sometimes regarded as Lewis's best, and in Monstre Gai and Malign Fiesta (1955), which resume The Childermass, a 'recognition of the experience of the other'. The later work, he says, constitutes a Kierkegaardian advance from aesthetics through ethics to theology. No doubt the imminence of mere death, as opposed to the vital deadness advertised by the Vorticist mantraps, had something to do with it. Edwards looks in great detail at the process of self-examination and the commitment to theological enquiry which give the later work a new and formidable gravity. The problem with this work, as he acknowledges, is that its agenda required it either to reject or to transform the principle of creative antagonism. Under taxing scrutiny, in Self Condemned or Malign Fiesta, the psychosis eventually dissolves, and with it a great deal else. \"Just as Lewis's drawing lost a certain kind of intensity when he began to recognise the inner reality of others,\" Edwards observes, \"so did his writing.\" In the writing, at least, the loss is absolute. The opening pages of Self Condemned would have been a rank embarrassment to the author of Inferior Religions. Edwards proves a subtle and informative guide to Lewis's deepening moral and spiritual preoccupations, and many readers will find his defence of the later work entirely persuasive. I didn't, quite, in the end, because a part of me wants to insist that wild bodies are what Lewis did best. It's the apoplectic gristle, stupid. Edwards's study deserves to remain for some time the standard point of reference in debates about the overall shape and status of Lewis's work, and it will have the entirely beneficial effect of diverting attention away from the over-emphasised 'Blast days'. Gristle-fanciers, however, may continue to find themselves drawn to The Wild Body and its like. In Inferior Religions, Lewis spoke of beauty as an \"icy douche\" of \"ease and happiness\" provoked by whatever suggests the perfect conditions for an organism. For Leonardo, he said, beauty was a \"red rain on the side of shadowed heads\", for Uccello it was a \"cold architecture of distinct colour\" and for Korin the \"symmetrical gushing\" of water. \"C\u00e9zanne liked cumbrous, democratic slabs of life, slightly leaning, transfixed in vegetable intensity.\" Of these, Lewis's own idea of beauty was closest to C\u00e9zanne's. Unlike C\u00e9zanne, however, he did the transfixing by anti-pathos. Whether or not it brought him much ease and happiness is hard to say.",

      "bodyText": "The Russia that Bill Clinton has just put behind him is a very different proposition from the country that he inherited from George W Bush's father, and while Washington has been agonising over the past two years about ''Who lost Russia?'', there is no doubt that US-Russian relations are at a much lower ebb in 2001 than they were in the heady, optimistic days of 1993 when Bill Clinton entered the White House and Boris Yeltsin was in his iconoclastic prime. Eight years on from Clinton's project to steer Russia towards democracy and free markets - an often fitful, hesitant and confused policy - Russia is under a new, younger and very different leadership from the Yeltsin clan. Hugely popular and more vigorous, President Vladimir Putin is also displaying authoritarian instincts. Fears for freedom of the press and of religion are rife. The economy is growing due to high oil prices, but mired in corruption with capital fleeing the country at alarming rates, while inward investment is minimal. A recent assessment by the CIA bleakly forecast unremitting decline on all fronts in Russia despite Putin's pledges to restore Russian greatness and international clout. ''Between now and 2015, Moscow will be challenged even more than today to adjust its expectations for world leadership to its dramatically reduced resources,'' the CIA study predicted. ''Whether the country can make the transition in adjusting ends to means remains an open and critical question, according to most experts, as does the question of the character and quality of Russian governance and economic policies. The most likely outcome is a Russia that remains internally weak.'' If the Putin feel-good factor has made Russians feel better about themselves in the past year, the romance with the west has soured. Both the government and wider society bear grudges towards the west, especially America, and are convinced that the ulterior Clinton motive was not to entrench democracy and improve the quality of life in Russia, but to keep Russia down, promote its weakness, and ensure that America remained unchallenged as what Madeleine Albright has called ''the indispensable power.'' The key geo-strategic moves disenchanting the Russians came in Clinton's second term with the expansion of Nato into the former Soviet satellites of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic and the Nato war against Yugoslavia in 1999 which Russian nationalists insist on seeing as a Pax Americana to be enforced around the Russian periphery, for example, in Chechnya. More broadly, the incoming Bush administration as well as Clinton-supporting Russia experts now dismiss the Clinton era as one of squandered opportunities as regards Russia. In a recent book, Princeton professor, Russia expert, and democrat, Stephen Cohen, describes Clinton's policy on Russia as the biggest American foreign policy disaster since Vietnam. In a recent article outlining the views of the new administration, Condoleezza Rice, Bush's national security adviser, declared that ''the problem for US policy is that the Clinton administration's ongoing embrace of Yeltsin and those who were thought to be reformers around him quite simply failed. US support for democracy and economic reform became support for Yeltsin. His agenda became the American agenda.'' This is the central criticism of Clinton's Russian policy - that it was too closely identified with the fortunes of Yeltsin rather than concentrating on building more durable democratic and economic institutions and structures. The German chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, directed the same criticism at his predecessor, Helmut Kohl - that policy towards Russia in the 90s was over-concentrated on male-bonding leaders, the chumminess of the Bill 'n' Boris act or the Boris and Helmut extravaganzas. Tony Blair appears to be trying to recreate this kind of relationship with Putin. The American anthropologist, Janine Wedel, in various books and articles, has analysed in devastating detail how US policy through the 90s was hijacked by a small and unaccountable clique of Russian and American economic liberals grouped around Anatoliy Chubais in Russia and free market economists at Harvard. The result was unwavering Washington support for a clique which pushed through shock therapy and mass privatisation with questionable results. The entire edifice of economic reform then degenerated further into hugely corrupt sell-offs of national industry at knockdown prices to a small clique of favoured businessmen in return for their support of the Yeltsin Kremlin. The outcome now is that in Russia, Chubais and the so-called oligarchs are the most reviled figures in Russia, making it popular for Putin to take politically motivated potshots at those of the oligarchs who incur his disfavour, while in America the aid gravy train is grinding to a halt and Russia fatigue has set in. ''[Clinton's] America certified that reform was taking place in Russia where it was not,'' argued Ms Rice. ''The realities in Russia simply did not accord with the administration's script about Russian economic reform.'' ''Many Russian futures are possible, ranging from political resurgence to dissolution,'' the CIA predicts. ''The general drift, however, is toward authoritarianism, although not to the extreme extent of the Soviet period ... [Russia's] domestic ills will frustrate its efforts to reclaim its great power status.'' Despite Clinton's efforts and notwithstanding Putin's central promises to Russia, the Bush administration finds itself dealing with an ever weaker Russia. The fear is that weakness could be a bigger problem than a healthy, happy Russia.

The report, part of a series of reviews to assess the performance of social services departments in England and Wales, found users and carers were less positive about Southend's services than those in the 80 other authorities examined so far. The joint review team found wide variations in the quality of the authority's services with those for older people, the mentally ill and people with learning difficulties lagging behind children's services.

      "bodyText": "ITV bosses are facing down claims they scheduled their way to higher ratings by cutting the advertising break before last night's relaunched News at Ten. One senior BBC news boss said: \"By running straight from Millionaire into the news without a break, ITV is not giving a true picture of how the ratings will look when News at Ten beds down.\" But a spokeswoman for the ITV network said claims were \"the same old rubbish from the BBC\". ITV was also criticised for delaying the start of the bulletin by two minutes. Last night's return of News at Ten after nearly two years - fronted by a rather nervous Sir Trevor McDonald - started with a lead-in from ratings grabber Who Wants to be a Millionaire?. ITV led on the possibility that Railtrack executives could face prosecution over the Hatfield crash. The BBC's Ten O'Clock News, fronted by Peter Sissons, opened with an exclusive interview with Paul Mukonyi, the hijacker who nearly caused a jumbo jet to crash on a flight to Nairobi. ITV's bulletin was in keeping with the traditional News at Ten agenda. It covered the big stories of the day directly and had a greater focus on domestic news than the BBC, which covered three foreign stories. The BBC's news was accused of leading with an exclusive just for the sake of it. However, it did its best to demonstrate how it would be superior to ITV in breaking late stories from Westminster. The BBC broke the results of the Lords' vote on human embryo-cloning after the News at Ten had gone off air. The BBC news' first night was also conspicuous for its beautifully filmed reports. These were about an oil spill threatening the Galapagos Islands and people perishing from the cold in Siberia. ITV, on the other hand, excelled in domestic human-interest stories. The decision to lead on rail safety, embryo-cloning and the MMR vaccine was a classic ITV mix. Roger Mosey, the BBC's head of TV news, said its bulletin had been a \"professional product\" in the face of tough competition from ITV. He added the BBC was \"particularly pleased to have a late-breaking story with the embryo vote after ITV had gone off air\". The ITV spokeswoman said News at Ten had made a \"very strong return\". She noted the programme had two big exclusives - interviews with William Hague and Lynne Bezant, the 56-year-old woman expecting twins. She added: \"The war of words between the broadcasters can stop because viewers can make up their own minds now about what they prefer. \"We are in this for the long term - this is not about newspaper headlines.\" In the face of a ratings disaster, the BBC was quick to declare a victory for quality news. Richard Sambrook, BBC deputy director of news, said: \"Last night's bulletins clearly showed the difference between us. \"The BBC Ten O'Clock News provided the most comprehensive, best quality bulletin for viewers. \"We had twice as much news, twice as much foreign coverage, twice as many live reports and were able to get the result of the late-night vote on embryo research. \"Our bulletin included full regional coverage and original material from around the world; ITVs lasted a mere 16 minutes and had no regional news.\" The BBC also took a swipe at ITV for its coverage of the aftermath of the mud-slides in El Salvador. One insider said: \"ITV's El Salvador piece was way out of date. \"It reported rescuers were still desperately digging for a survivor. Two hours earlier, PA reported they had given up hope.\"",

      "body": "<p>Some of the world's rarest animals were being evacuated from their habitats in the Galapagos archipelago last night as an international clear-up team failed to contain a 150,000 gallon spillage of diesel oil which is advancing to new islands. </p> <p>Three days after the Ecuadorean tanker Jessica started leaking oil, the slick covers more than 300 square kilometres within one of the most fragile and untouched marine ecosystems in the world. it threatens the islands' unique species of plants and animals that were crucial in helping Charles Darwin develop his theory of evolution when he visited the Galapagos in 1835. </p> <p>Ecuador's environment minister said the accident had already caused \"extremely severe\" environmental damage. David Bellamy, president of the Galapagos Foundation, told Radio 4's The World at One: \"Here you have a unique series of ecosystems which are under immense pressure anyway. It is a catastrophe.\" </p> <p>Last night the spillage was due to reach Espanola island, the southernmost tip of the archipelago, 600 miles west of the mainland. The oil had already spread west to Santa Fe island, home to the Santa Fe land iguana, and was continuing north to the central Santa Cruz island. </p> <p>The bay of San Cristobal island, where the Jessica ran aground last Tuesday, was described as \"a black pond\" by Stalin Suarez, of the Galapagos national park's crisis team. </p> <p>\"It's a pretty big spill,\" he said. \"It's sad if it reaches any island. We are trying to see in what way we can make the impact the minimum.\" </p> <p>A US coastguard team has joined the Ecuadorean operation and on Sunday started a round-the-clock pump-out of the remaining 100,000 gallons still in the tanker. At least 31,000 gallons has been cleared, according to Mr Suarez. Captain Edwin Stanton said he would try to transfer the fuel into empty tanks within the ship that are still intact. </p> <p>Pressure from the surf, however, was creating new fissures and speeding up the leak. A strong tide could cause the tanker to break apart. </p> <p>\"The bottom line is once oil gets out of a ship its virtually impossible to remove it or contain it on the ocean,\" Capt Stanton said. More than 150 environmentalists, park rangers and even tourists were preparing to alleviate the potential effects on wildlife. Animals are being evacuated from coastal areas to prevent them being harmed. Even though the Galapagos is best known for reptiles such as the giant tortoise, it contains 28 unique bird species which are more susceptible to oil slicks. Volunteers were being sent to beaches to bring affected birds to veterinary stations. By last night only a small number of boobies, pelicans and sealions had been reached by the oil.</p> <p>Paola Diaz, of the Charles Darwin Centre on Santa Cruz island, said recuperation priority would be given to the lava gull, the rarest gull in the world, baby sealions and petrels. </p> <p>The long-term danger is that the fuel will sink to the ocean floor, destroying algae vital to the food chain, threatening marine iguanas, sharks, birds and other species. </p> <p>The islands are important because their remoteness and barrenness has given rise to many species not found anywhere else. Almost all the reptiles, half the plants and a quarter of the species of fish are unique. </p> <p>The oil spills are just the latest problems facing the UN world heritage site. Large commercial fishing boats are now invading the waters of the 7m-acre Galapagos marine reserve, taking thousands of tons of fish illegally. </p> <p>In the past few weeks, lawless bands of Ecuadorean fishermen have violently attacked conservation installations, ransacked municipal offices, torched a national park vehicle, harassed tourist groups and taken rare captive-bred giant tortoises hostage, in an attempt to gain higher quotas. </p> <p>The Jessica was on a routine trip to service a private tour boat operator and Petrocomercial, an arm of the state oil company that provides the islands with fuel, when it ran aground 500 metres off San Cristobal island. A pipe in the ship's marine room burst on Friday, starting the leak.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Some of the world's rarest animals were being evacuated from their habitats in the Galapagos archipelago last night as an international clear-up team failed to contain a 150,000 gallon spillage of diesel oil which is advancing to new islands. Three days after the Ecuadorean tanker Jessica started leaking oil, the slick covers more than 300 square kilometres within one of the most fragile and untouched marine ecosystems in the world. it threatens the islands' unique species of plants and animals that were crucial in helping Charles Darwin develop his theory of evolution when he visited the Galapagos in 1835. Ecuador's environment minister said the accident had already caused \"extremely severe\" environmental damage. David Bellamy, president of the Galapagos Foundation, told Radio 4's The World at One: \"Here you have a unique series of ecosystems which are under immense pressure anyway. It is a catastrophe.\" Last night the spillage was due to reach Espanola island, the southernmost tip of the archipelago, 600 miles west of the mainland. The oil had already spread west to Santa Fe island, home to the Santa Fe land iguana, and was continuing north to the central Santa Cruz island. The bay of San Cristobal island, where the Jessica ran aground last Tuesday, was described as \"a black pond\" by Stalin Suarez, of the Galapagos national park's crisis team. \"It's a pretty big spill,\" he said. \"It's sad if it reaches any island. We are trying to see in what way we can make the impact the minimum.\" A US coastguard team has joined the Ecuadorean operation and on Sunday started a round-the-clock pump-out of the remaining 100,000 gallons still in the tanker. At least 31,000 gallons has been cleared, according to Mr Suarez. Captain Edwin Stanton said he would try to transfer the fuel into empty tanks within the ship that are still intact. Pressure from the surf, however, was creating new fissures and speeding up the leak. A strong tide could cause the tanker to break apart. \"The bottom line is once oil gets out of a ship its virtually impossible to remove it or contain it on the ocean,\" Capt Stanton said. More than 150 environmentalists, park rangers and even tourists were preparing to alleviate the potential effects on wildlife. Animals are being evacuated from coastal areas to prevent them being harmed. Even though the Galapagos is best known for reptiles such as the giant tortoise, it contains 28 unique bird species which are more susceptible to oil slicks. Volunteers were being sent to beaches to bring affected birds to veterinary stations. By last night only a small number of boobies, pelicans and sealions had been reached by the oil. Paola Diaz, of the Charles Darwin Centre on Santa Cruz island, said recuperation priority would be given to the lava gull, the rarest gull in the world, baby sealions and petrels. The long-term danger is that the fuel will sink to the ocean floor, destroying algae vital to the food chain, threatening marine iguanas, sharks, birds and other species. The islands are important because their remoteness and barrenness has given rise to many species not found anywhere else. Almost all the reptiles, half the plants and a quarter of the species of fish are unique. The oil spills are just the latest problems facing the UN world heritage site. Large commercial fishing boats are now invading the waters of the 7m-acre Galapagos marine reserve, taking thousands of tons of fish illegally. In the past few weeks, lawless bands of Ecuadorean fishermen have violently attacked conservation installations, ransacked municipal offices, torched a national park vehicle, harassed tourist groups and taken rare captive-bred giant tortoises hostage, in an attempt to gain higher quotas. The Jessica was on a routine trip to service a private tour boat operator and Petrocomercial, an arm of the state oil company that provides the islands with fuel, when it ran aground 500 metres off San Cristobal island. A pipe in the ship's marine room burst on Friday, starting the leak.",

You've seen too much Mary Poppins, sir. <br></p> <p><strong> But isn't getting caked in soot the real fun of the job?</strong> Not in my book. <br></p> <p><strong> So what is the job?</strong> Chimney sweeps, often described as chimney technicians, provide a maintenance service that ensures domestic and commercial/ industrial chimneys are kept free from chemical deposits and other obstructions such as cobwebs, birds' nests and leaves. Sweeping ensures that heating systems are safe, effective and efficient, and prevents carbon monoxide poisoning and chimney fires. <br></p> <p><strong> I suppose it's a dying art.</strong> Far from it. Increasing concerns over carbon monoxide poisoning from faulty appliances and flues and gas safety in general has increased the demand for chimney sweeping. But we don't just sweep. <br></p> <p><strong> You dance on the rooftops?</strong> No, but there are sweeps who repoint and rebuild chimney pots; fit birdcages and cowls. They also fit and repair fireplaces, boilers, firebacks and hearths, supply fireplace parts, reline chimneys. <br></p> <p><strong> OK I get the message.</strong> We also turn up at weddings to bring good luck! <br></p> <p><strong> Are you usually self-employed?</strong> Yes, the majority of chimney sweeps are, although some may work for private firms, for instance, solid fuel distributors. <br></p> <p><strong> Is there any training?</strong> It is essential for chimney sweeps to be trained so that their work is carried out in a safe and proper manner. Sweeps must be CORGI registered (Council of Registered Gas Installers) if they are dealing with gas appliances.

      "bodyText": "Oh, I was expecting the chimney sweep. That's me. But chimney sweeps ought to be covered in grime. And speak like Dick van Dyke, no doubt. You've seen too much Mary Poppins, sir. But isn't getting caked in soot the real fun of the job? Not in my book. So what is the job? Chimney sweeps, often described as chimney technicians, provide a maintenance service that ensures domestic and commercial/ industrial chimneys are kept free from chemical deposits and other obstructions such as cobwebs, birds' nests and leaves. Sweeping ensures that heating systems are safe, effective and efficient, and prevents carbon monoxide poisoning and chimney fires. I suppose it's a dying art. Far from it. Increasing concerns over carbon monoxide poisoning from faulty appliances and flues and gas safety in general has increased the demand for chimney sweeping. But we don't just sweep. You dance on the rooftops? No, but there are sweeps who repoint and rebuild chimney pots; fit birdcages and cowls. They also fit and repair fireplaces, boilers, firebacks and hearths, supply fireplace parts, reline chimneys. OK I get the message. We also turn up at weddings to bring good luck! Are you usually self-employed? Yes, the majority of chimney sweeps are, although some may work for private firms, for instance, solid fuel distributors. Is there any training? It is essential for chimney sweeps to be trained so that their work is carried out in a safe and proper manner. Sweeps must be CORGI registered (Council of Registered Gas Installers) if they are dealing with gas appliances. To become CORGI registered it is necessary to get a certificate of competence through the National Accredited Certification Scheme (ACS) for Individual Gas Fitting Operatives. What about for general sweeping? The National Association of Chimney Sweeps, (NACS) offers advice and training at their own training centre which is accredited by the Construction Industry Training Board and can offer NVQ level 2 in basic sweeping techniques. It also offers the complete CITB/City &amp; Guilds NVQ level 2 course in chimney engineering and other courses in association with a variety of professional bodies such as the Heating Equipment Testing and Approval Scheme (HETAS), the Oil Firing Technician Association for the Petroleum Industry (OFTEC) and CORGI. \u0095 The National Association of Chimney Sweeps, Unit 15 Emerald Way, Stone Business Park, Stone, Staffordshire, ST15 0SR Telephone 01785 811732 Website: www.chimneyworks.co.uk Email: nacs@chimneyworks.co.uk \u0095 Council of Registered Gas Installers (CORGI), 1 Elm Wood, Chineham Business Park, Crockford Lane, Basingstoke, Hampshire, RG24 8WG Telephone 01256 372200 nacs@chimneyworks.co.uk Website: www.corgi-gas.com",

      "body": "<p>The first national survey of adult literacy courses for a generation shows that students on them still make disappointingly little progress in reading and even less in writing. The findings have shocked ministers just weeks before Tony Blair launches New Labour's major strategy to tackle the country's basic skills problem. </p> <p>But they see the results as vindicating their determination to be the first government to make a serious effort to reduce the estimated 20% of the adult population with poor or no literacy and numeracy. </p> <p>Malcolm Wicks, the minister for lifelong learning, who has direct responsibility for the new strategy, said: \"The results are dismal and they are a real spur for action. There are a lot of good things going on, but the overall national picture is dire.\" </p> <p>The report - Progress in Adult Literacy: Do Learners Learn? by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) - is the first national survey of adult literacy provision since the mid 1970s, said Alan Wells, director of the Basic Skills Agency, which commissioned it. </p> <p>There is a shortage of reliable research in this field, not just in the UK, but anywhere in the world, he said. </p> <p>The mid-70s picture showed only a quarter of learners made significant progress, half made \"only very modest progress\", and a quarter showed no improvement. </p> <p>\"It would be encouraging to report that this recent NFER study showed many more adults making substan tial progress... encouraging, but it wouldn't be true,\" said Wells. </p> <p>There is also scant research on the relative effectiveness of different teaching and learning methods, according to Dr Greg Brooks, of Sheffield university, who co-authored the new report. </p> <p>Not enough is known about what works and what doesn't in teaching adult literacy, he told an \"international colloquium\" on the topic, organised by the DfEE last week. </p> <p>Over three days, experts from the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, and from the Flemish education department described their national or regional approaches to the problem. Most made it clear that increasing hopes are pinned on information technology and specially designed computer-learning packages, many available on the internet. </p> <p>But Malcolm Wicks told the conference he remained to be convinced, despite the growth of these innovative learning materials, that ordinary people with basic skills needs would be attracted to use them. </p> <p>Holding the event so close to the launch of the government's new strategy did not imply \"floundering around\" for solutions, he said. </p> <p>\"I think we know that the quality of materials has to be enhanced greatly. We know that inspection makes a difference. We can build on the national literacy strategy which is proving so successful in schools.\" </p> <p>Susan Pember, director of the DfEE's new Adult Basic Skills Strategy Unit, stressed that the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority had now defined the basic skills curriculum and that intensive training of teachers to deliver it had just started. </p> <p>Brooks said that the new survey, which scrutinised students on 71 courses run by further education colleges and local education authorities, showed that tutors were largely part-time. Although well qualified, they lacked opportunity for professional development. Classroom assistants able to address individual needs made a real difference, but were not available to 40% of tutors. </p> <p>The students were given tests before and after the courses. The reading students showed a \"small but statistically significant improvement\". Writing students showed no significant reduction in errors and no increase in complexity in their retests.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The first national survey of adult literacy courses for a generation shows that students on them still make disappointingly little progress in reading and even less in writing. The findings have shocked ministers just weeks before Tony Blair launches New Labour's major strategy to tackle the country's basic skills problem. But they see the results as vindicating their determination to be the first government to make a serious effort to reduce the estimated 20% of the adult population with poor or no literacy and numeracy. Malcolm Wicks, the minister for lifelong learning, who has direct responsibility for the new strategy, said: \"The results are dismal and they are a real spur for action. There are a lot of good things going on, but the overall national picture is dire.\" The report - Progress in Adult Literacy: Do Learners Learn? by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) - is the first national survey of adult literacy provision since the mid 1970s, said Alan Wells, director of the Basic Skills Agency, which commissioned it. There is a shortage of reliable research in this field, not just in the UK, but anywhere in the world, he said. The mid-70s picture showed only a quarter of learners made significant progress, half made \"only very modest progress\", and a quarter showed no improvement. \"It would be encouraging to report that this recent NFER study showed many more adults making substan tial progress... encouraging, but it wouldn't be true,\" said Wells. There is also scant research on the relative effectiveness of different teaching and learning methods, according to Dr Greg Brooks, of Sheffield university, who co-authored the new report. Not enough is known about what works and what doesn't in teaching adult literacy, he told an \"international colloquium\" on the topic, organised by the DfEE last week. Over three days, experts from the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland, and from the Flemish education department described their national or regional approaches to the problem. Most made it clear that increasing hopes are pinned on information technology and specially designed computer-learning packages, many available on the internet. But Malcolm Wicks told the conference he remained to be convinced, despite the growth of these innovative learning materials, that ordinary people with basic skills needs would be attracted to use them. Holding the event so close to the launch of the government's new strategy did not imply \"floundering around\" for solutions, he said. \"I think we know that the quality of materials has to be enhanced greatly. We know that inspection makes a difference. We can build on the national literacy strategy which is proving so successful in schools.\" Susan Pember, director of the DfEE's new Adult Basic Skills Strategy Unit, stressed that the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority had now defined the basic skills curriculum and that intensive training of teachers to deliver it had just started. Brooks said that the new survey, which scrutinised students on 71 courses run by further education colleges and local education authorities, showed that tutors were largely part-time. Although well qualified, they lacked opportunity for professional development. Classroom assistants able to address individual needs made a real difference, but were not available to 40% of tutors. The students were given tests before and after the courses. The reading students showed a \"small but statistically significant improvement\". Writing students showed no significant reduction in errors and no increase in complexity in their retests.",

But the Americans produce the bulk of case studies used, so many European schools are likely to use US cases as well. Also very popular is the idea of developing and writing a business plan. Business plans require students to demonstrate what they have learned in all areas of business administration, from strategic planning to financial management to human resource management.

      "body": "<p>Paul Sandi puts in at least 24 hours' worth of hard work each week. The only problem is that it's not for his studies as a full-time marketing undergraduate at Middlesex University. Instead, it's for two part-time jobs which, besides taking up so much time and thereby potentially jeopardising his academic performance, are not giving him a fair deal. </p> <p>As a student employed through an agency he takes home \u00a32 an hour less than other directly employed sales assistants at his local BT shop. And he feels threatened when he has to deliver pizzas at night in an area where a co-worker was recently stabbed. </p> <p>\"I think I signed something with the agency but I'm not sure what or even when,\" says Paul, 20. \"I end up trying to do assignments in the early hours and revise after night shifts. Of course working affects your studies, but everyone's doing it.\" </p> <p>Chances are that with almost 75% of all students working, at least one has served you in a shop, poured you a drink or answered your call some time in the last week. And they're likely to be juggling an average 20 hours of employment a week with full-time studies, usually in low-paid, casual jobs in the service or care sectors with little security or protection. </p> <p>Research also shows that in this era of pay-your-way degrees, just under half of all working students don't have written contracts, even though this is illegal and leaves them open to abuse. Some are forced to work extra hours without extra pay and miss out on sick and holiday pay. More than a third report health and safety problems at work - ranging from unsafe working practices to actual injury. Many feel their academic institutions don't understand the problems they face trying to balance casual work with studies. </p> <p>To help pre-empt or remedy such difficulties, the largest UK trade union, Unison, is today launching a website (<a href=\"http://www.troubleatwork.org.uk\">www.troubleatwork.org.uk</a>) for working students. It offers information and advice on work-related problems. It covers everything from how to make sure you get paid properly and handling difficult bosses or customers to juggling work with studies and dealing with stress and money worries. Working students are encouraged to get proper advice about work problems, join the relevant union and communicate with student welfare and tutors when their studies are affected. </p> <p>\"It's not a substitute for joining a union, but a way of reaching young people who are busy trying to keep up with studies and make ends meet,\" says Unison's general secretary, Dave Prentis. \"Students now make up a significant part of the labour force but know little about their rights at work, and have little job security or protection. We want them to get a decent deal at work and know where they can go to get help.\" </p> <p>Trade unions are waking up to the fact that students are working and that they need more support at work than they're getting. Many students don't realise that they can join a trade union while still at college and that most offer special rates for young members or those in higher education. But having a bit of back-up on the job can make a real difference. </p> <p>Bradford University student Labhaoise McGrane, 20, worked part-time on the till and stacking shelves for the local supermarket chain, Jackson's, for four months last year. Her first month's pay cheque was withheld while she waited for her National Insurance number to come through. It was only after she let drop that she had been in contact with the shop workers union, Usdaw, that she eventually got the back pay due. </p> <p>\"I found out from the union that I should have been receiving two-thirds of my wages before I got my NI number and I'm still trying to claim back emergency tax,\" says McGrane. \"I don't think any of it was deliberate. They just didn't know how to deal with students like me.\" </p> <p>Some work problems can be much more serious. Sussex University student Simon Jones was killed on his first day of work unloading cargo in the hold of a ship. After a vigorous campaign by Jones's family and friends, Euromin and its manager are set to go on trial charged with corporate manslaughter. </p> <p>Talk to any university tutor, counsellor or welfare officer and stories of employment abuse abound. One postgraduate student from Thailand received no pay at all despite working long hours in a local restaurant over a six-month period. </p> <p>\"She came to student advice too late to do anything about the employer,\" recalls Richard Wilson, senior counsellor at the University of Bradford Counselling Service. \"But we accessed hardship funds and gave her psychological support. In the end she somehow managed to get her degree.\" </p> <p>International students may be particularly vulnerable because they are less likely to know about their employment rights in the UK and may be even more desperate for the money. The irony is that at a time when most students are working long hours, they are also under increased pressure to perform well academically. Dr Denise deCaires Narain is sub-dean of the School of African and Asian Studies at Sussex, where she lectures in Caribbean literature and oversees the welfare of more than 650 students. </p> <p>\"Ten years ago people came here to devote three years of their lives to study,\" she says. \"Today's students are squeezing in academic life around paid work, yet we still expect students to do the same amount of academic work if not more. And they desperately want to do well because of the costs now involved for them and their families and they know that in a more competitive job market, employers want good degrees.\" </p> <p>DeCaires Narain estimates that around 10 students are dropping out each year from her faculty. \"They're working long hours, doing poor academic work and running up huge debt. Most intermit and come back after a year off having earned some money. But a few just leave because they can't make the academic work and employment pressures add up.\" </p> <p>Sussex University is ensuring more students can access professional counselling and centralising services such as student loans, hardship funds and welfare advice under one roof. </p> <p>One interesting phenomenon is the huge growth of job shops on campuses. There are now an estimated 80 such services across the country, operating on the principle that if students have to work, it's better to vet external employers or even employ students at the university. </p> <p>University job shops usually say students should work no more than 15 hours a week on top of their studies. They hand out codes of practice to students and employers, based on guidelines drawn up by, among others, the National Association of Student Employment Services. </p> <p>The Cubie Report on financing in Scottish higher education suggests that students work a maximum 10 hours a week during term-time, that universities should establish part-time employment schemes and advise on how to balance studies with earning money. </p> <p>But attempts to regulate student employment seem unlikely to deter cash-strapped students or the growing demand for part-time, casual labour. The UK already has one of the highest rates of working students in Europe and the Office of National Statistics predicts that by 2006 over half of all under-20s in the labour force will be students. </p> <p>There is already some evidence of a rise in suicide rates among students.

      "bodyText": "Paul Sandi puts in at least 24 hours' worth of hard work each week. The only problem is that it's not for his studies as a full-time marketing undergraduate at Middlesex University. Instead, it's for two part-time jobs which, besides taking up so much time and thereby potentially jeopardising his academic performance, are not giving him a fair deal. As a student employed through an agency he takes home \u00a32 an hour less than other directly employed sales assistants at his local BT shop. And he feels threatened when he has to deliver pizzas at night in an area where a co-worker was recently stabbed. \"I think I signed something with the agency but I'm not sure what or even when,\" says Paul, 20. \"I end up trying to do assignments in the early hours and revise after night shifts. Of course working affects your studies, but everyone's doing it.\" Chances are that with almost 75% of all students working, at least one has served you in a shop, poured you a drink or answered your call some time in the last week. And they're likely to be juggling an average 20 hours of employment a week with full-time studies, usually in low-paid, casual jobs in the service or care sectors with little security or protection. Research also shows that in this era of pay-your-way degrees, just under half of all working students don't have written contracts, even though this is illegal and leaves them open to abuse. Some are forced to work extra hours without extra pay and miss out on sick and holiday pay. More than a third report health and safety problems at work - ranging from unsafe working practices to actual injury. Many feel their academic institutions don't understand the problems they face trying to balance casual work with studies. To help pre-empt or remedy such difficulties, the largest UK trade union, Unison, is today launching a website (www.troubleatwork.org.uk) for working students. It offers information and advice on work-related problems. It covers everything from how to make sure you get paid properly and handling difficult bosses or customers to juggling work with studies and dealing with stress and money worries. Working students are encouraged to get proper advice about work problems, join the relevant union and communicate with student welfare and tutors when their studies are affected. \"It's not a substitute for joining a union, but a way of reaching young people who are busy trying to keep up with studies and make ends meet,\" says Unison's general secretary, Dave Prentis. \"Students now make up a significant part of the labour force but know little about their rights at work, and have little job security or protection. We want them to get a decent deal at work and know where they can go to get help.\" Trade unions are waking up to the fact that students are working and that they need more support at work than they're getting. Many students don't realise that they can join a trade union while still at college and that most offer special rates for young members or those in higher education. But having a bit of back-up on the job can make a real difference. Bradford University student Labhaoise McGrane, 20, worked part-time on the till and stacking shelves for the local supermarket chain, Jackson's, for four months last year. Her first month's pay cheque was withheld while she waited for her National Insurance number to come through. It was only after she let drop that she had been in contact with the shop workers union, Usdaw, that she eventually got the back pay due. \"I found out from the union that I should have been receiving two-thirds of my wages before I got my NI number and I'm still trying to claim back emergency tax,\" says McGrane. \"I don't think any of it was deliberate. They just didn't know how to deal with students like me.\" Some work problems can be much more serious. Sussex University student Simon Jones was killed on his first day of work unloading cargo in the hold of a ship. After a vigorous campaign by Jones's family and friends, Euromin and its manager are set to go on trial charged with corporate manslaughter. Talk to any university tutor, counsellor or welfare officer and stories of employment abuse abound. One postgraduate student from Thailand received no pay at all despite working long hours in a local restaurant over a six-month period. \"She came to student advice too late to do anything about the employer,\" recalls Richard Wilson, senior counsellor at the University of Bradford Counselling Service. \"But we accessed hardship funds and gave her psychological support. In the end she somehow managed to get her degree.\" International students may be particularly vulnerable because they are less likely to know about their employment rights in the UK and may be even more desperate for the money. The irony is that at a time when most students are working long hours, they are also under increased pressure to perform well academically. Dr Denise deCaires Narain is sub-dean of the School of African and Asian Studies at Sussex, where she lectures in Caribbean literature and oversees the welfare of more than 650 students. \"Ten years ago people came here to devote three years of their lives to study,\" she says. \"Today's students are squeezing in academic life around paid work, yet we still expect students to do the same amount of academic work if not more. And they desperately want to do well because of the costs now involved for them and their families and they know that in a more competitive job market, employers want good degrees.\" DeCaires Narain estimates that around 10 students are dropping out each year from her faculty. \"They're working long hours, doing poor academic work and running up huge debt. Most intermit and come back after a year off having earned some money. But a few just leave because they can't make the academic work and employment pressures add up.\" Sussex University is ensuring more students can access professional counselling and centralising services such as student loans, hardship funds and welfare advice under one roof. One interesting phenomenon is the huge growth of job shops on campuses. There are now an estimated 80 such services across the country, operating on the principle that if students have to work, it's better to vet external employers or even employ students at the university. University job shops usually say students should work no more than 15 hours a week on top of their studies. They hand out codes of practice to students and employers, based on guidelines drawn up by, among others, the National Association of Student Employment Services. The Cubie Report on financing in Scottish higher education suggests that students work a maximum 10 hours a week during term-time, that universities should establish part-time employment schemes and advise on how to balance studies with earning money. But attempts to regulate student employment seem unlikely to deter cash-strapped students or the growing demand for part-time, casual labour. The UK already has one of the highest rates of working students in Europe and the Office of National Statistics predicts that by 2006 over half of all under-20s in the labour force will be students. There is already some evidence of a rise in suicide rates among students. Universities UK (formerly the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals) is sponsoring research into the scale of the problem and strategies to reduce it, which will be published this summer. Recent studies reveal poorer mental and physical health among students than in the rest of the population, and link rising levels of depression to growing financial pressures, hours worked and the competing demands of university and employment. \"Students have never been under more pressure. From day one they're facing academic, social and employment pressures, stress and even danger at work,\" says one of the researchers, Dr Ron Roberts, now at the Institute of Psychiatry in London. \"They're anxious and depressed and can't study. It's a mass, ill-thought out social experiment for which we're all going to pay in the future.\" The first website offering information and advice for working students, www.troubleatwork.org.uk, is launched by Unison in conjunction with the NUS.",

But it was successful exports of a different nature which had particularly earned the award: academic degrees. Only one month before, prime minister Tony Blair, MP for Durham, had announced a new target of boasting the numbers of overseas students in UK universities by 75,000 by 2005. </p> <p>But now part of Durham Associates, a subsidiary company called the Management Development Centre (MDC) faces a review of the UK-based business postgraduate degrees it runs for home and foreign students. Academic quality watchdogs are carying out an audit of the business and management school at the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside. </p> <p>Students on the courses are awarded \"top-up\" masters degrees after only two weekend seminars and a 20,000-word dissertation completed while still at work. According to MDC's marketing material, one student completed their degree in just six months. </p> <p>The doctoral programme run by MDC, meanwhile, involves only 12 weekend seminars, and a 40,000 to 50,000-word dissertation, once again completed while students are still in full-time work. And according to MDC at least one student completed his doctorate after only two and a half years under the programme. This is highly unusual in the academic world: most students slave away full-time for up to four or five years to complete their PhDs. </p> <p>MDC says that the programmes are of high academic standards. The masters degrees are only open to students who already have professional marketing diplomas, and the doctorates are only completed by high-flying business executives. </p> <p>It is a flash point which illuminates some of the fundamental tensions surfacing in the academic world. Quality inspectors are desperately trying to keep an eye on academic standards as the higher education sector rapidly expands. And if the quality of postgraduate degrees is being questioned, it is not just the UK's academic reputation that is at stake, but the value of all the masters and doctoral degrees hard won by everyone else. </p> <p>At the same time, the sector is on the cusp of a new innovative era - providing more flexible degrees, serving new types of student customers, and increasingly being located in different parts of the world. And as this week's MBA fair testifies, the entrepreneurial spirit is nowhere more vibrant than in the postgraduate professional business sector, one of the most lucrative areas of higher education. </p> <p>The masters and doctoral courses run by MDC cost students \u00a32,750 and \u00a319,500 respectively, excluding VAT and accommodation costs. </p> <p>It was MDC which first approached the quality inspectors. According to senior officials at the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, the company apparently expressed disquiet about its plans to define masters qualifications so that programmes comprising mainly undergraduate modules would be prevented from using the masters title. </p> <p>The plans are part of the agency's qualifications framework to be published later this month, which represent a major overhaul for the academic sector, with many undergraduate courses losing their status. </p> <p>Adverts in educational sections of professional magazines called for enrolments to part-time MBA and DBA programmes run by MDC at the premises of the Chartered Institute of Marketing (CIM). </p> <p>\"These offered substantial accreditation of prior learning, especially for potential students working in a commercial context,\" says the director of programme review at the QAA, Dr Peter Milton. \"Such arrangements are relatively uncommon for qualifications at this level and we therefore investigated briefly and informally the validation arrangements with the validating university, as well as discussing the programmes with representatives of the CIM.\" </p> <p>All part-time and full-time degrees at the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside will be scrutinised as part of a review of the university's business and management school due in the autumn term of 2001. </p> <p>MDC's marketing material set off several alarm bells that alerted the antennae of the quality inspectors. In one press release, for example, the company boasts that one student finished his doctorate in 30 months. Another student tells how she was able to get through a masters degree in just six months. </p> <p>Derek Crothall, the university's pro vice-chancellor, stresses that it is top-up masters degrees, not full-time masters, that are offered. Entry moreover depends on the student already holding a postgraduate diploma from the CIM. Only one exceptional student completed the degree in six months, but the norm is one year of study. And one outstanding student completed a doctorate in two and a half years, but the average time is four years. </p> <p>\"ULH is absolutely satisfied that these postgraduate degrees are of the academic standard required,\" says Crothall. \"External examiners' reports have always been good.\" </p> <p>Examination of the masters and doctoral dissertations is carried out by experienced academics approved by the university, he says. </p> <p>David Picken, from Durham Associates, says that students are sent an extensive list of course notes, textbooks and papers which they must go through prior to the weekend seminars for both masters and doctoral programmes. Recommended reading for courses includes books, websites, trade bodies, downloadable papers, journals, marketing magazines, marketing research resources, and newspapers. </p> <p>The executive DBA (doctor of business administration) is relatively new, he says, and is based on the American model, but universities operating similar programmes include Hull and Bournemouth. There are also about 20 other universities providing similar top-up masters programmes for the CIM diploma holders. </p> <p>According to Picken, the two study weekends for the masters courses are conducted by two university tutors, and are extremely extensive </p> <p>\"There are two assignments for each weekend - one done during the weekend and handed in on Sunday, one to be handed in two weeks after each weekend,\" he says. \"Students must pass this coursework before they are allowed to submit a research proposal, which goes to the university, and only when internal approval is obtained can work be started on the dissertation. Coursework is marked by course tutors, cross marked and then internally moderated at the university. All marks are ratified by exam board.\" </p> <p>Whatever the outcome of the autumn inspection, though, MDC's ac tivities will not continue under the current arrangements. After a wide-ranging review of its international activities, ULH says - for reasons unconnected with quality - that it is terminating its agreement with MDC. </p> <p>Picken said: \"ULH is concentrating on its virtual campus and so we, like 16 or 17 other managing and promotional agents, have been told the contracts will not be renewed. That happened 18 months ago but we are both working with existing students to see them through their courses without any problem.\" </p> <p>Milton says: \"This will not occur before our review of the relevant provision later this year, however, and we expect to look closely at these programmes in the context of a normal subject review.\" </p> <p>ULH meanwhile says it has received very positive feedback from students on the course. Some 500 have graduated or are currently studying for masters degrees and doctorates worldwide through MDC and MDC international, which runs similar courses in five other countries. </p> <p>\"I considered that the teaching was excellent and feedback from students supported this view,\" said one auditor employed by the university.</p>",

And one outstanding student completed a doctorate in two and a half years, but the average time is four years. \"ULH is absolutely satisfied that these postgraduate degrees are of the academic standard required,\" says Crothall. \"External examiners' reports have always been good.\" Examination of the masters and doctoral dissertations is carried out by experienced academics approved by the university, he says. David Picken, from Durham Associates, says that students are sent an extensive list of course notes, textbooks and papers which they must go through prior to the weekend seminars for both masters and doctoral programmes. Recommended reading for courses includes books, websites, trade bodies, downloadable papers, journals, marketing magazines, marketing research resources, and newspapers. The executive DBA (doctor of business administration) is relatively new, he says, and is based on the American model, but universities operating similar programmes include Hull and Bournemouth. There are also about 20 other universities providing similar top-up masters programmes for the CIM diploma holders. According to Picken, the two study weekends for the masters courses are conducted by two university tutors, and are extremely extensive \"There are two assignments for each weekend - one done during the weekend and handed in on Sunday, one to be handed in two weeks after each weekend,\" he says. \"Students must pass this coursework before they are allowed to submit a research proposal, which goes to the university, and only when internal approval is obtained can work be started on the dissertation. Coursework is marked by course tutors, cross marked and then internally moderated at the university. All marks are ratified by exam board.\" Whatever the outcome of the autumn inspection, though, MDC's ac tivities will not continue under the current arrangements. After a wide-ranging review of its international activities, ULH says - for reasons unconnected with quality - that it is terminating its agreement with MDC. Picken said: \"ULH is concentrating on its virtual campus and so we, like 16 or 17 other managing and promotional agents, have been told the contracts will not be renewed. That happened 18 months ago but we are both working with existing students to see them through their courses without any problem.\" Milton says: \"This will not occur before our review of the relevant provision later this year, however, and we expect to look closely at these programmes in the context of a normal subject review.\" ULH meanwhile says it has received very positive feedback from students on the course. Some 500 have graduated or are currently studying for masters degrees and doctorates worldwide through MDC and MDC international, which runs similar courses in five other countries. \"I considered that the teaching was excellent and feedback from students supported this view,\" said one auditor employed by the university.",

She used to be a school nurse, but not one of those starchy and formidable matrons of an outdated stereotype. Just 28, she is warm, informal and evidently used to persuading youngsters to talk about subjects they would rather not discuss with adults. Smoking, in this case. </p> <p>This quartet have already filled in one of the 14-page questionnaires devised to elicit information for Croghan's four-year investigation into the tobacco trade in schools. They have been selected at random from their contemporaries here in south Birmingham to answer further questions. Anonymity has been guaranteed. We'll call them David, Paul, Lara and Jane. All I am allowed to know is that one is a regular smoker, one smokes occasionally, one has given up smoking and the other doesn't smoke at all.

She's also well aware that smoking at school has gone on for generations. At least two things have changed in recent times.

There are five or six assumptions that we make as adults, but perhaps we're getting it wrong.\" </p> <p>Croghan's chance to look at ways of getting it right came when she gave a presentation to her school governors about her trip to Colorado. Among the audience was a professor of epidemiology at Birmingham University who suggested she might like to do research closer to home. A grant of \u00a3116,000 has since been forthcoming from the National Health Service.

Another three years will be spent on a PhD investigating ways of countering the problem.

In Ofsted's annual report he will criticise the current muddle of grants and allowances, bids and quotas, and underline the effect on schools of widespread budget variations. </p> <p>Central government has forced schools to follow a national curriculum and local authorities are deluged with targets and directives. But government is silent about the amounts of money which should be spent in schools: there's no national entitlement, no minimum standard. </p> <p>Instead there is a system where taxpayers' money is divvied up in Whitehall on the basis of a complex formula that few people pretend to understand. This Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) is supposed to take into account local needs and circumstances; in reality it's simply a reflection of what an area has received in the past. </p> <p>Nearly half the money local authorities spend comes down this route, but there is no guarantee that the money Whitehall earmarks for schools will end up in the classroom. Some authorities spend more than the government recommends, many spend less and all use their own local funding formula to finally decide how much the education of an individual child is worth. </p> <p>A recent Audit Commission report condemned the funding disparities and called on the government to use the extra money being pumped into education over the next three years to level the funding field. \"These variations need to be challenged,\" said the report. \"Unfortunately the lack of transparency in the system means that such a challenge isn't always possible.\" </p> <p>The \"variations\" amount to a postcode lottery, where school budgets can differ for no apparent reason. For primary school children, the highest funding authority is Kensington and Chelsea in London, with a spend of \u00a32,873 per pupil. Nottinghamshire spends just \u00a31,582 - nearly \u00a31,300 less, a shortfall equivalent to half a million pounds a year for an average-sized primary school. </p> <p>For secondary children, Kensington and Chelsea heads the national funding figures again, with a figure per pupil of \u00a33,626. Northumberland spends \u00a31,862, leaving a 1,000-pupil school in that area nearly \u00a32m out of pocket. </p> <p>These are huge differences. Schools with the extra funding will be able to afford smaller classes, more special needs support, more books, more materials - more of everything. </p> <p>\"Very few parents are aware of these issues,\" says John McNally, head of St Bernadette's RC primary school, in Birmingham. \"The vast majority of parents assume that the money is the same wherever you live.\" </p> <p>Comparisons between rural and urban authorities are often branded unfair, with accusations that critics have failed to take into account the special circumstances in each local area. London local authorities are particularly resentful of contrasting figures, which ignore the considerably higher costs in the capital. </p> <p>But even neighbouring schools with broadly similar circumstances can have wildly different budget allocations.

His annual budget for 500 pupils is \u00a3820,000. \"If my school was inside Birmingham I would be getting an extra \u00a3223,500 a year,\" he says. A few miles to the south, John McNally's school gets \u00a31,241,532. Staffordshire gives its schools an average of \u00a31,640 per primary pupil. In Birmingham the average figure is \u00a32,087. </p> <p>\"Everything stems from these numbers,\" says Stockley. \"If I was in Birmingham I could buy more books, spend more on the buildings. I could employ more teachers, more support staff. I'm having to do much of the administration myself and my staff get no administration time at all.\" </p> <p>\"We originally came from Birmingham,\" says Peter Element, whose 10-year-old daughter Naomi is in year 6 at Landywood. \"It was my choice to move to Staffordshire, but I didn't realise that the funding was so low here.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, in Small Heath, John McNally can afford things that his Staffordshire colleagues can only dream about. \"I have money for support staff for special needs and a host of other things,\" he says. </p> <p>McNally is keen to emphasise the fact that his situation isn't perfect. His classes are too large. \"I would like to see more funding here,\" he says. \"But we all have the same curriculum to deliver. We should be aiming to level the funding upwards.\" </p> <p>Even within authorities there can be bizarre anomalies created by the complex formulae used to distribute funding. In most areas primary schools are funded much less generously than their secondary neighbours. </p> <p>John Cash is head of Westgate primary in Suffolk's Bury St Edmunds. With 289 pupils on roll he receives \u00a3504,181 to run his school, \u00a31,744 per pupil. But a middle school in the same area, catering for 273 pupils, receives \u00a3661,256, whilst a local high school receives \u00a31,051,419 for just 294 pupils, an individual pupil allocation of \u00a33,576, double that received by the primary school. </p> <p>\"Teachers in primary schools,\" says Cash, \"need time away from the children for meetings and preparation. How can we do that with this level of finance?\" Cash accepts that the more complex curriculum in middle and high schools should be reflected with more money. \"But over \u00a3150,000 more?\" he asks. </p> <p>Headteachers' organisations have been bending the ear of anyone who would listen on the subject for some time, but they argue that the solution has to be a levelling up. \"I don't want other schools' money,\" says Stockley, \"I want equal money.\" </p> <p>The government points to a green paper produced by John Prescott's Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions, which suggests a reform of the system. The results of the consultation process are currently being studied by ministers. </p> <p>\"But why for the first two years of government did they do absolutely nothing?\" asks Phil Willis, Liberal Democrat education spokesman. \"Prior to '97 there were clear statements that they were going to reform this process. There was a real commitment; every school in the country expected some kind of new formulae.\" </p> <p>The green paper says that changes could begin in the 2004/2005 budget year, but it would take a further three years for changes to work through the funding system. </p> <p>\"That's a timescale of 10 years, from the '97 election to the implementation of the changes they promised,\" says Willis. \"An entire school population has been allowed to move through a system which is patently unfair.\" </p> <p>David Kidney chairs F40, the all-party group of MPs calling for a fairer funding system for the poorest authorities. Kidney argues that, with proposals on the table, the government could move quickly to correct the situation: \"It wouldn't be impossible to see a white paper before the election. If, as the green paper says, there will be no losers in any funding change, there's no reason why the government shouldn't be moving on this issue.\" </p> <p>But heads' organisations aren't happy with the green paper. They would prefer to see direct funding of schools through the DfEE, together with a national formula which would guarantee a minimum level of funding for every child. \"There's a national curriculum, national tests, a national inspection system, national pay rates,\" argues John Dunford from the Secondary Heads Association. \"A national funding system is essential.\" </p> <p>\"Where are the equal opportunities for these children?\" asks Alan Stockley. \"All schools are under pressure to meet government targets on literacy and numeracy. But once I've allocated resources to the things I have to deliver, I've absolutely nothing left for the arts, for music, PE - all the things which help develop the whole child.\" </p> <p>Parents are left scratching their heads. Under the current system it's almost impossible for a parent to get a meaningful statement about education funding in their area. If parents want to find out how much their LEA gives a school for educating their child, all they can do is ask a string of questions. How does the local funding formula work? How much is given to their child's school? How much of the education budget is held back to be spent centrally and what does the local authority spend its central funding on? Then they have to try to make some sense of the answers. </p> <p>\"The system needs changing,\" says Peter Element. There needs to be transparency and equality. \"All children need the same support. They all study the same things, don't they?\"</p>",

Naomi's headteacher says: \"Once I've allocated resources to the things I have to deliver, I've nothing left for the arts, for music, for PE - all things which develop the whole child.\" Name: Aimee McCartan Age: 10 School: St Bernadette's RC Primary School in Birmingham How much is she worth? Her school receives \u00a31,970 a year to educate each individual pupil. There are a total of 630 pupils on the roll, so the school receives \u00a31.24m from Birmingham LEA. With \u00a31,970, a school could buy: * A full-time newly qualified teacher for 6.5 weeks. * A classroom assistant for just over 10 weeks. * A complete redecoration of the school hall - and 15 chairs. * 281 books for the library. The system that delivers taxpayers' money to Britain's schools is about as clear as mud, and children are the direct losers, the new chief inspector of schools, Mike Tomlinson, will argue next month. In Ofsted's annual report he will criticise the current muddle of grants and allowances, bids and quotas, and underline the effect on schools of widespread budget variations. Central government has forced schools to follow a national curriculum and local authorities are deluged with targets and directives. But government is silent about the amounts of money which should be spent in schools: there's no national entitlement, no minimum standard. Instead there is a system where taxpayers' money is divvied up in Whitehall on the basis of a complex formula that few people pretend to understand. This Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) is supposed to take into account local needs and circumstances; in reality it's simply a reflection of what an area has received in the past. Nearly half the money local authorities spend comes down this route, but there is no guarantee that the money Whitehall earmarks for schools will end up in the classroom. Some authorities spend more than the government recommends, many spend less and all use their own local funding formula to finally decide how much the education of an individual child is worth. A recent Audit Commission report condemned the funding disparities and called on the government to use the extra money being pumped into education over the next three years to level the funding field. \"These variations need to be challenged,\" said the report. \"Unfortunately the lack of transparency in the system means that such a challenge isn't always possible.\" The \"variations\" amount to a postcode lottery, where school budgets can differ for no apparent reason. For primary school children, the highest funding authority is Kensington and Chelsea in London, with a spend of \u00a32,873 per pupil. Nottinghamshire spends just \u00a31,582 - nearly \u00a31,300 less, a shortfall equivalent to half a million pounds a year for an average-sized primary school. For secondary children, Kensington and Chelsea heads the national funding figures again, with a figure per pupil of \u00a33,626. Northumberland spends \u00a31,862, leaving a 1,000-pupil school in that area nearly \u00a32m out of pocket. These are huge differences. Schools with the extra funding will be able to afford smaller classes, more special needs support, more books, more materials - more of everything. \"Very few parents are aware of these issues,\" says John McNally, head of St Bernadette's RC primary school, in Birmingham. \"The vast majority of parents assume that the money is the same wherever you live.\" Comparisons between rural and urban authorities are often branded unfair, with accusations that critics have failed to take into account the special circumstances in each local area. London local authorities are particularly resentful of contrasting figures, which ignore the considerably higher costs in the capital. But even neighbouring schools with broadly similar circumstances can have wildly different budget allocations. Alan Stockley is head of the Landywood Primary School in Staffordshire. Landywood is an urban area just 10 miles north of Birmingham's city centre.

Now, though, comes news of the triangle-shaped pupil formation: not just a formation, in fact, but a triangle-shaped classroom, no less. </p> <p>The pioneering classrooms, unveiled last week, are at a special school called Cam House in Dursley, Gloucestershire. Because the school caters for boys aged 11-16 taken out of mainstream education due to behavioural and emotional difficulties, classes are no more than eight - so the triangle formation is rather different there than it would be in a conventional 30-pupil class. </p> <p>\"It works by putting the longest line of pupils on the front row, and then tapers towards the back with just one pupil on the back row,\" explains Gail Howells, who teaches at Cam House. \"The big advantage is view: I can see them all better. It's a very flexible arrangement, too - it means it's easy to regroup them quickly, if we want to, during a lesson. I don't think the pupil at the back necessarily feels isolated, but if he did we could easily change the formation and bring him up to the second row. </p> <p>\"The children themselves say they like it - one of them told me he feels he has a better view, particularly of the board. One of the big advantages at the moment is that it's all new and a bit of a novelty, but I feel it will continue to work well. And although there are particular circumstances about our school, I think it would be worth looking at in the wider context.\" </p> <p>The truth is that the rights and wrongs of classroom formation have been a neglected science over recent years. \"Until the 60s you heard a lot about the individual learner and not a lot about anything else,\" explains Peter Kutnick, professor of educational research at the University of Brighton. \"Since then we've had a growing awareness of learning as a social process, and we've found out there's a learner-learner structure in which pupils help one another to master a skill or task. On the back of this, we got this new classroom structure of small groups sitting around tables, but what we didn't do was back that up by training teachers properly in how to teach the skills the children need to learn effectively in their groups.\" In other words, we set up the structure before putting the theory in place - and we've been living with the consequences ever since. </p> <p>In fact, points out Kutnick, around 60% or 70% of a pupil's work is individual. So wouldn't it be more sensible to have children grouped in something other than around small tables? </p> <p>The answer, according to Nigel Hastings, professor of education at Nottingham Trent University, is that it certainly would: in fact, he says, everything points to the fact that anything but group seating is considerably better for individual work. \"We know from research already done that when the task is an individual one, if you switch the arrangement to something other than group seating the effect is to increase the amount of time the average child spends actively engaged in the task. For children who are most easily distracted, you could double the work rate.\" </p> <p>Exactly what alternative formation you use is less important than that it isn't groups, says Hastings. \"The implication of this isn't a return to rows,\" he stresses. \"You can have a horseshoe or an L-shape or another formation. The crucial thing is that for individual tasks, children aren't sitting opposite one another.\" </p> <p>Later this year, Hastings will publish work reviewing the available evidence on classroom formation and detailing case histories in which teachers are already putting his theory into practice with positive results. It will show that where children are changed from working in small groups to working in different formations for individual work, their \"on task\" time increases by between 16% and 124%. Children in older primary school classes, who work alone for the larger part of the day, could gain most from teachers taking on board Hastings' findings. </p> <p>The key, says Hastings, is flexibility. \"In the examples we've looked at of teachers who are working flexibly, there are usually two or three basic classroom layouts. The teacher changes them depending on the task. Pupils either know themselves how to rearrange their desks, or there are seating monitors who take charge of rearranging the formation.\" </p> <p>What Hastings has to say sounds so much like basic common sense that it's extraordinary that we've spent three decades hardly questioning why our children spend their time working around small tables, some with their backs to the teacher and unable to have eye contact with the adult in charge. The status quo has become so orthodox it's rarely questioned - and what's more there's evidence that teachers are afraid to put different ideas they may have into practice, says Hastings. </p> <p>\"There seem to be worries about being thought out of line for changing classroom formations - some teachers seem to think they'll come in for criticism from their heads or their colleagues or even maybe Ofsted, if they try something different,\" he says. \"But what we found in our research is that this is rarely the case. </p> <p>\"Another fear teachers have is that rearranging desk formations will cause a lot of disruption and noise at the start of a class.

But now, a seemingly chastened Benetton is giving itself a spanking new image, abandoning shock tactics and instead opting for the rather more mundane theme of clothes. Benetton is to roll out a billboard and press drive in over 100 countries from mid-February, promoting its spring-summer 2001 collection. It will be the first ad outing since the devastating \"Death row\" campaign last year, which caused widespread outcry and eventually led to the departure of creative director Olivieri Toscani after 18 years with the company. \"Post Toscani, the new advertising is concentrating on products rather than issues,\" said a Benetton spokeswoman. It was created by 27-year-old British photographer James Mollison from the Benetton-funded Fabrica arts institute in northern Italy. The huge media buying operation is also co-ordinated from Italy. The company said all advertising would now come out of Fabrica, which was established in 1994 by chairman Luciano Benetton. Benetton said the new ads set out to \"convey a sense of a free, contemporary product\" which is \"clean, fun-loving and colourful, designed to be seen on streets all over the world. \"They are produced from colourful photographs of young people - black and white - against a white background, wearing Benetton T-shirts, jumpers or swimwear.\" However, the most noticeable aspect of the campaign is its concentration on everyday people sporting its gear - not unlike rival Gap - a far cry from its tradition of hard-hitting photographs on controversial issues. The spring-summer 2000 collection was launched with Toscani's notorious \"Death row\" campaign which showed US prisoners under sentence of execution. The campaign upset relatives and ultimately US retail giant Sears Roebuck, which decided to delist Benetton's stock in 400 stores. Mr Toscani departed shortly afterwards. Other controversial Benetton campaigns have included a photograph of a dying Aids patient and a bloody new-born child attached by its umbilical cord. However, the company was praised for using Down Syndrome models in one of its catalogues.",

His announcement comes as he meets Tony Blair and Welsh first minister, Rhodri Morgan, to discuss the closures at the loss-making Llanwern steelworks in South Wales. The plant is owned by Corus which was formerly partly owned by British Steel. As many as 6,000 steelworkers' jobs are under threat and ministers are pessimistic of their ability to dissuade the company from going ahead with the shutdown. An announcement is expected this week. One ministerial source said: \"We have tried to deal with the company's genuine problems, but the level of pressure from Corus shareholders is high.\" Ministers fear closures at Llanwern could be accompanied by job losses at the firm's Redcar plant, and even at the highly productive Nissan car plant on Tyneside. Any cutbacks are bound to be blamed on the strength of the pound, leading pro-Europeans to demand a clearer government commitment to join a single currency. In a speech today Mr Byers will stress the importance of manufacturing and announce an extra \u00a354m to a new regional innovation unit to be allocated to England's nine regional development agencies. The cash is being allocated to the regions on the basis of their relative economic position. Previously, DTI regional money has been allocated on a flat rate basis across the nine regions according to population size. A DTI official said this represented the beginning of a new regional policy. Until now policy had been \"location blind\". As a result, the bulk of the money will go to the north east (\u00a38.9m), north west (\u00a37.4m) Yorkshire and Humberside (\u00a310m). Mr Byers will say: \"We cannot build a strong economy if we have a trail of underperforming areas. To succeed we need all parts of all our regions firing on all cylinders. \"This government intends to help areas tackle both historical regional disparities and respond to the challenges of the modern, global economy.\" He will also insist that the government is not just abandoning manufacturing, but recognises its importance to the British economy. He will point out it accounts for about a fifth of national income with almost \u00a3150bn in output per year, and employs around 4m people directly. The RIF cash is being distributed for the first time on the basis of a region's GDP per capita, research and development spending and unemployment rates. The cash will promote innovation and enterprise, and to support clusters and networks of businesses in their area. Mr Morgan said: \"It is no longer a question of how many days we have got left to dissuade Corus. It is a matter of time before Corus decides to have its board meeting. \"The package of assistance seems to be less important than what we are going to do if the axe falls.\"",

Each reflects a new kind of world shaped not by old clashes of ideology or power but by more complex forces which could blight the 21st century just as the 20th.\" Mr Hain's pamphlet, which was approved by the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, and by Downing Street, will be seen as an attempt to redefine the government's \"ethical\" foreign policy. Ministers have faced severe criticism for failing to live up to their manifesto commitment to add a humanitarian dimension to British diplomacy. There was an embarrassing reminder of the ethical foreign policy record yesterday when the author of the report on the arms to Iraq scandal criticised the government for failing to change the law on arms exports. On the Today programme, Lord Justice Scott said: \"It's regrettable, because I think it's important, and it's it's long, long overdue.\"",

Briony Ackroyd, one of the first surgeons to perform a mastectomy and reconstructive surgery in the same operation, was suspended from work at Walsgrove hospital in Coventry last February. Her critics allege her complication rate was too high and her patients were not fully informed of the risks. But her supporters, including former patients, claim she has been subjected to a \"witch-hunt\" by a male-dominated field in which her woman's touch, such as visiting patients at home, is not appreciated. They believe Dr Ackroyd, 52, offers women hope after they have suffered the trauma of breast removal. A spokesman for her supporters said: \"She seemed to have a very special relationship with all of her patients and she provided a very special and unique service.\" A spokesman for the General Medical Council confirmed last night there had been \"discussions with the hospital about this doctor\" after the hospital contacted them. An investigation into the surgeon's clinical practice was launched after a family sued the hospital for negligence over an operation that went wrong, according to the Times.

Last night Lady Warnock, who chaired the original inquiry into human fertilisation in the 1980s, said: \"The word cloning sends shivers of horror down the spines of the British public.\" Lord Alton, who brought yesterday's amendment calling for no order to be passed until a select committee had a chance to report back, said: \"When the minister told the House of Commons a pre-14-day-old embryo had the power to facilitate cures to mankind's human misery, it simply underlined to me that, even at this early stage of development, we are not dealing with something inconsequential,\" he said.

Explaining the decision to go ahead with the caning yesterday, a spokesman for the state government, Bashir Sanda, said local authorities wanted to end the international controversy created by the court's verdict and sentence. \"The governor felt he ought to act immediately to put the matter to rest,\" Mr Bashir said. \"He ordered that the punishment should be carried out to avoid all the pressure and the tension created.\" The deputy governor of Zamfara state, Mahmoud Shinkafi, said Miss Magazu was bruised but \"not badly hurt\" by the flogging. \"Immediately after the punishment she thanked Allah for having the punishment. She walked home and when she got to her village she was very happy.\" Human rights groups accused the provincial government and Sharia court of violating a pact to put the flogging on hold while Miss Magazu is breastfeeding her baby. \"It's a shock. It's a horrible thing to happen to Bariya,\" said Aisha Imam, head of a women's rights group.",

      "bodyText": "One of seven escaped Texas prisoners accused of killing a policeman while on the run for more than a month commited suicide last night and four more were captured after their cover as travelling Christians was blown. The men, known as the Texas Seven, were intercepted in a trailer park in Colorado, evidently without fulfilling the most blood-curdling predictions about how the hunt for them would end. Numerous theories about the gang's location and intentions emerged over almost six weeks, along with claims and counter-claims about who was to blame for the breakout: a system that kept prisons under-staffed and guards underpaid, or the officers who failed to prevent the prisoners' escape. Larry Harper, 37, who had been serving 50 years for three rapes, shot himself in the chest as police attempted to persuade him to leave a mobile home last night. He had said that he would not do so until he had spoken to his father. George Rivas, 30, the robber and kidnapper thought to be the gang's ringleader, was among the four held. A child-batterer and two murderers were also in custody. They were picked up after a tip-off to the police from someone in the park. It was not clear whether a $500,000 (\u00a3340,000) reward had played a part in the tip-off. Police said they did not know the whereabouts of the other two members of the gang, but believed that they might still be in the area around the trailer park, about 50 miles south of Denver. \"They were all supposed to be Christians who were travelling around the country and said they were going to be staying here,\" said a woman who spent time with the men the day before and did not want to be identified. She knew one of the men as Jim. \"We went out to lunch after church - he bought our dinner. We took him round some of the sights here. He was very calm and very clean-cut. You'd think he was a college guy. He was not nervous at all. We had a very, very pleasant time with him.\" The men escaped from a maximum security prison 60 miles south-east of San Antonio on December 13, taking with them 14 handguns, a rifle, a shotgun and more than 200 rounds of ammunition. There were more than 1,200 \"sightings\" as the nationwide hunt for the men went on, right across the southern states and even as far north as New York. But only two of the sightings were confirmed: one when they stole police scanners from an electrical store in Houston, the other when a sports shop in a Dallas suburb was raided and $70,000 and 25 more guns and ammunition were taken. It was during the second of these raids, on Christmas Eve, that a 29-year-old policeman, Aubrey Hawkins, was killed. His mother, Jaynie Hawkins, said last night: \"My initial reaction is one of sadness because this makes it real. Do I want to see them? Only because I want them to see me.

The US and Britain are trying to shore up efforts to contain President Saddam after the steady demolition of their trade embargo by Arab and European states.</p> <p>Similar intelligence reports formed the basis for the Desert Fox bombing raid by the US and Britain two years ago.</p> <p>Foreign Office diplomats have been in Washington in the last week discussing Iraq and other foreign policy issues with the new administration. An FO spokesman said: \"The general assessment that Iraq may be reconstituting biological and chemical weapons is one we share.\"</p> <p>But the Foreign Office and US state department were careful to avoid saying they had proof, as this would automatically trigger new air raids.</p> <p>The claim comes just 10 days after the Pentagon made public an intelligence assessment of the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons worldwide. Its report said Iraq \"shows no let-up in its pursuit to reconstitute its pre-war weapons and missile capabilities\".</p> <p>According to the new reports, one rebuilt factory is using a mash made from castor beans that contains a deadly biological toxin called ricin. The Iraqis claim the castor oil is used for brake fluid. Another produces chlorine, which is used for nuclear production and for cleaning water.</p> <p>George Galloway, the Labour MP who has been leading the British campaign to have sanctions against Iraq lifted, said yesterday: \"There is a long campaign of misinformation about the purpose of factories as a prelude for US attacks.\"</p> <p>He described the latest reports as propaganda \"to justify the increasingly unjustified siege of Iraq\".</p> <p>The US and the Foreign Office stressed that the reports were from officials in the old administration and should not necessarily be taken as an insight into Mr Bush's approach.</p> <p>The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, is planning to meet Iraqi ministers next month to discuss lifting sanctions in return for allowing in UN weapons inspectors.</p> <p>Although the UN weapons team, Unscom, has not been allowed into Iraq since December 1998, the International Atomic Energy Agency, a nuclear proliferation watchdog, has been allowed to continue with less intrusive inspections.</p> <p>The IAEA is this week carrying out its annual inspection of nuclear material in Iraq. Four inspectors - from Egypt, Poland, Russia and South Africa - are visiting the Tuwaitha nuclear centre, 12 miles south of Baghdad, to check that low-grade material, sealed in 1998, has not been touched.</p> <p>The centre was the main site for Iraq's nuclear programme before the Gulf war and is the location of the Osiraq reactor, bombed by Israel in 1981.</p> <p>David Kidd, the IAEA's spokesman in Vienna, said the inspectors were carrying out tests to determine the quantity and quality of material stored.</p> <p>\"It's a thorough check, but no replacement for what the [UN] security council would like to have us do,\" he said.</p> <p>Several Iraqi defectors have claimed that President Saddam is continuing to develop a bomb. Salman Yassin Zweir, an engineer who was said to have spent 13 years working for the Iraqi atomic energy commission, said recently that work resumed in secret in August 1998.</p> <p>The American estimate is that it would take Baghdad at least five years to build nuclear weapons.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, has rebuilt three factories which are now capable of producing chemical weapons, the US and Britain claimed yesterday. The disclosure is intended to step up pressure on Baghdad and signals a new hard line as George Bush begins his presidency. The US and Britain are trying to shore up efforts to contain President Saddam after the steady demolition of their trade embargo by Arab and European states. Similar intelligence reports formed the basis for the Desert Fox bombing raid by the US and Britain two years ago. Foreign Office diplomats have been in Washington in the last week discussing Iraq and other foreign policy issues with the new administration. An FO spokesman said: \"The general assessment that Iraq may be reconstituting biological and chemical weapons is one we share.\" But the Foreign Office and US state department were careful to avoid saying they had proof, as this would automatically trigger new air raids. The claim comes just 10 days after the Pentagon made public an intelligence assessment of the threat posed by the proliferation of weapons worldwide. Its report said Iraq \"shows no let-up in its pursuit to reconstitute its pre-war weapons and missile capabilities\". According to the new reports, one rebuilt factory is using a mash made from castor beans that contains a deadly biological toxin called ricin. The Iraqis claim the castor oil is used for brake fluid. Another produces chlorine, which is used for nuclear production and for cleaning water. George Galloway, the Labour MP who has been leading the British campaign to have sanctions against Iraq lifted, said yesterday: \"There is a long campaign of misinformation about the purpose of factories as a prelude for US attacks.\" He described the latest reports as propaganda \"to justify the increasingly unjustified siege of Iraq\". The US and the Foreign Office stressed that the reports were from officials in the old administration and should not necessarily be taken as an insight into Mr Bush's approach. The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, is planning to meet Iraqi ministers next month to discuss lifting sanctions in return for allowing in UN weapons inspectors. Although the UN weapons team, Unscom, has not been allowed into Iraq since December 1998, the International Atomic Energy Agency, a nuclear proliferation watchdog, has been allowed to continue with less intrusive inspections. The IAEA is this week carrying out its annual inspection of nuclear material in Iraq. Four inspectors - from Egypt, Poland, Russia and South Africa - are visiting the Tuwaitha nuclear centre, 12 miles south of Baghdad, to check that low-grade material, sealed in 1998, has not been touched. The centre was the main site for Iraq's nuclear programme before the Gulf war and is the location of the Osiraq reactor, bombed by Israel in 1981. David Kidd, the IAEA's spokesman in Vienna, said the inspectors were carrying out tests to determine the quantity and quality of material stored. \"It's a thorough check, but no replacement for what the [UN] security council would like to have us do,\" he said. Several Iraqi defectors have claimed that President Saddam is continuing to develop a bomb. Salman Yassin Zweir, an engineer who was said to have spent 13 years working for the Iraqi atomic energy commission, said recently that work resumed in secret in August 1998. The American estimate is that it would take Baghdad at least five years to build nuclear weapons.",

Sea levels could rise by 88cm (34.5in) by 2100, making tens of millions of people homeless in China's Pearl river delta, Bangladesh, the Nile delta of Egypt, and other low-lying regions. </p> <p>\"We see changes in climate, we believe we humans are involved and we're projecting future climate changes much more significant over the next 100 years than the last 100 years,\" said Robert Watson, introducing the latest, 1,000-page report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change. </p> <p>Klaus Topfer, head of the UN environment programme, said the report \"should ring alarm bells in every national capital and every local community\". </p> <p>The 1990s was the warmest decade for 1,000 years, said the report. Temperatures rose by an average of 0.6C during the last century, with an increase in floods and droughts. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen by 31% since the beginning of the industrial revolution, and scientists blame the reckless burning of fossil fuels. In one of the ironies of global politics, the scientists issued their report on the day that George Bush - who has said he is not convinced climate change is really happening - took office as the new US president. </p> <p>But much of the science behind the IPCC report comes from the highest tiers of US and European research. The warnings may kickstart a political process that has been stalled since November. Developed nations met at the Hague to agree to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 5.5% by 2010 - well short of the 60% cut scientists say is needed - but the talks collapsed, largely because of US attitudes. </p> <p>The researchers present the \"worst case\" picture, as well as projections of possi ble temperature rises if nations cooperate. But the outlook is grim. The area of northern polar sea ice has shrunk by up to 15% in the past 40 years, and the thickness of the ice has fallen by 40%. Satellite studies have shown that snow cover has shrunk by 10% in the past 30 years. </p> <p>Environmentalists described the report as \"terrifying\". Sir John Houghton, a former Meteorological Office chief and an IPCC member, said: \"The 6C depends on just how much fossil fuel we burn this next century - if we burn less, then the increase will be less. But what it means for the world is that the sea level will rise.\"</p>",

Sea levels could rise by 88cm (34.5in) by 2100, making tens of millions of people homeless in China's Pearl river delta, Bangladesh, the Nile delta of Egypt, and other low-lying regions. \"We see changes in climate, we believe we humans are involved and we're projecting future climate changes much more significant over the next 100 years than the last 100 years,\" said Robert Watson, introducing the latest, 1,000-page report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change. Klaus Topfer, head of the UN environment programme, said the report \"should ring alarm bells in every national capital and every local community\". The 1990s was the warmest decade for 1,000 years, said the report. Temperatures rose by an average of 0.6C during the last century, with an increase in floods and droughts. Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have risen by 31% since the beginning of the industrial revolution, and scientists blame the reckless burning of fossil fuels. In one of the ironies of global politics, the scientists issued their report on the day that George Bush - who has said he is not convinced climate change is really happening - took office as the new US president. But much of the science behind the IPCC report comes from the highest tiers of US and European research. The warnings may kickstart a political process that has been stalled since November. Developed nations met at the Hague to agree to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 5.5% by 2010 - well short of the 60% cut scientists say is needed - but the talks collapsed, largely because of US attitudes. The researchers present the \"worst case\" picture, as well as projections of possi ble temperature rises if nations cooperate. But the outlook is grim. The area of northern polar sea ice has shrunk by up to 15% in the past 40 years, and the thickness of the ice has fallen by 40%. Satellite studies have shown that snow cover has shrunk by 10% in the past 30 years. Environmentalists described the report as \"terrifying\". Sir John Houghton, a former Meteorological Office chief and an IPCC member, said: \"The 6C depends on just how much fossil fuel we burn this next century - if we burn less, then the increase will be less. But what it means for the world is that the sea level will rise.\"",

The doctor sighed, replying: \"You don't do that here.\"</p> <p>It was another example of the culture clash which has unsettled Hull's generally successful record at coping with more than 1,000 asylum seekers. \"The police aren't the same as in Iraq,\" he went on. \"They'll help if you get trouble from hooligans. But they won't stand for arming yourselves with bicycle chains.\"</p> <p>Fuelling the youths' fears were the experiences of friends such as Fardin Farqu, an Afghan stabbed in the city, and Mohammed Ali, a 26-year-old Kosovan, blinded in one eye by a stone.</p> <p>But since July - the end of a four-month stretch which saw 35 suspected racial attacks - Humberside police have moved into the Avenues area of the city. Partly they are on patrol; partly they are doing basic liaison work such as explaining how to change a lightbulb (it is different in Kurdish Iraq).</p> <p>The refugees are concentrated near the suburban Avenues area. And the local Kwik-Save and the Indian and continental stores are where many of the Home Office's refugee vouchers end up - the glaring signal that a shopper is a refugee.</p> <p>\"It's a world of dark looks in queues,\" says Dr Bajilan, \"I think specially because the asylum seekers shop where the poorest local people shop, and it's the poorest people who feel they're a threat, buying things they want or somehow threatening jobs.\"</p> <p>In fact, no asylum seeker is legally allowed to work, but rumours spread and unemployment in Hull is still a noticeable 7.4%.</p> <p>In the city centre post office the queues are more than a trivial problem too - up to now this post office has been the only one allowed to take vouchers.</p> <p>But that seems likely to change, and still more pressure on the Home Office has led to the council and social services getting extra information on asylum seekers in Hull via private landlords. It means that instead of greeting refugees off the coach with \"Hello number 53\", officials will have names to hand.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.societytheguardian.com/refugees\">SocietyGuardian special report on refugees</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.acpo.police.uk/policies/acpohcr.pdf\" target=\"_new\">ACPO guide to hate crime (pdf file)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.kent.police.uk\" target=\"_new\">Kent constabulary</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.politie.nl/home/engels\" target=\"_new\">Dutch police</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The young Kurds were scared when the doctor got to them at the police station and asked why on earth they had gone out for a night at a Hull fairground with bicycle chains in their pockets. \"We have to protect ourselves,\" the oldest told Hamed Bajilan, who besides being a consultant at Hull royal infirmary was acting as their translator. The doctor sighed, replying: \"You don't do that here.\" It was another example of the culture clash which has unsettled Hull's generally successful record at coping with more than 1,000 asylum seekers. \"The police aren't the same as in Iraq,\" he went on. \"They'll help if you get trouble from hooligans. But they won't stand for arming yourselves with bicycle chains.\" Fuelling the youths' fears were the experiences of friends such as Fardin Farqu, an Afghan stabbed in the city, and Mohammed Ali, a 26-year-old Kosovan, blinded in one eye by a stone. But since July - the end of a four-month stretch which saw 35 suspected racial attacks - Humberside police have moved into the Avenues area of the city. Partly they are on patrol; partly they are doing basic liaison work such as explaining how to change a lightbulb (it is different in Kurdish Iraq). The refugees are concentrated near the suburban Avenues area. And the local Kwik-Save and the Indian and continental stores are where many of the Home Office's refugee vouchers end up - the glaring signal that a shopper is a refugee. \"It's a world of dark looks in queues,\" says Dr Bajilan, \"I think specially because the asylum seekers shop where the poorest local people shop, and it's the poorest people who feel they're a threat, buying things they want or somehow threatening jobs.\" In fact, no asylum seeker is legally allowed to work, but rumours spread and unemployment in Hull is still a noticeable 7.4%. In the city centre post office the queues are more than a trivial problem too - up to now this post office has been the only one allowed to take vouchers. But that seems likely to change, and still more pressure on the Home Office has led to the council and social services getting extra information on asylum seekers in Hull via private landlords. It means that instead of greeting refugees off the coach with \"Hello number 53\", officials will have names to hand.

      "body": "<p>Police across Britain are to challenge the \"ill-informed, adverse media coverage\" of asylum seekers, which they say has contributed to a rise in racial tension and increased risk of public disorder.</p> <p>\"Racist expressions towards asylum seekers appear to have become common currency and acceptable in a way which would never be tolerated towards any other minority,\" says a report by the Association of Chief Police Officers, which was leaked to BBC Radio 5 Live ahead of its publication next month.</p> <p>The report says that the arrival of asylum groups across the UK, which has aroused racist tendencies within local populations, has led to expressions of racism (not to be confused with legitimate political debate on immigration policy) that should be challenged by the police.</p> <p>\"Where adequate evidence exists of criminal offences, consideration should be given to prosecute,\" the guide adds.</p> <p>The report was leaked as the Home Office published research showing that economic migration helps to fill labour market shortages, improve public finances, and contribute to the development of industries and jobs.</p> <p>The Acpo guide, drawn up with the help of Dutch police but in the main by the Kent force after their experience of clashes at Dover, says that with no action plan to manage tensions between the indigenous population and asylum seekers, significant racial tensions and public disorder may arise.</p> <p>Experience over the past four years showed that where asylum communities were established there was ill-informed adverse media coverage, which contributed to heightened tension and resentment.</p> <p>The guide says failure to achieve instead a \"positive media message may undermine much of the police service's efforts to maintain community harmony\". But it also warns that within refugee communities animosity is an \"ever present danger\" because of the mix of ethnic groups.</p> <p>It adds: \"Language and cultural barriers, along with a common misunderstanding of the role of the police, mean that asylum seekers are unlikely to report racist crimes and incidents.</p> <p>\"While the majority of asylum seekers have no criminal motives and wish to peacefully co-exist, some will use violence beyond our normal experience in retaliating to racist attacks, responding to criminal exploitation or resolving inter-ethnic disputes.</p> <p>\"Such violence will be best prevented by accurate intelligence profiles of criminals in asylum communities and racist offenders of all nationalities; and positive efforts to resolve crimes and tensions between asylum seekers.\"</p> <p>The chief constables say that all police forces should counter alarmist views that might fuel racism. It suggests getting \"key messages\" across to the local media, stressing that the area welcomes thousands of visitors a year; that asylum seekers are real people who need our urgent support and could make a valuable contribution to life; that Britain has a history of absorbing cultures; and that being an asylum seeker is no fun partly because of the new, restrictive asylum rules.</p> <p>With regard to the experiences of police in challenging unfounded media fears about an asylum crimewave, the report noted a case where a vicar, in a town with a large number of asylum seekers, made a public statement [saying] asylum seekers were taking housing and school places from locals. \"This was not the case,\" says the report. \"But because of his position in the community, the story made front page news. The story was highlighted by an extremist political party justifying and legitimising its position.\"</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.societytheguardian.com/refugees\">SocietyGuardian special report on refugees</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.acpo.police.uk/policies/acpohcr.pdf\" target=\"_new\">ACPO guide to hate crime (pdf file)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.kent.police.uk\" target=\"_new\">Kent constabulary</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.politie.nl/home/engels\" target=\"_new\">Dutch police</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Police across Britain are to challenge the \"ill-informed, adverse media coverage\" of asylum seekers, which they say has contributed to a rise in racial tension and increased risk of public disorder. \"Racist expressions towards asylum seekers appear to have become common currency and acceptable in a way which would never be tolerated towards any other minority,\" says a report by the Association of Chief Police Officers, which was leaked to BBC Radio 5 Live ahead of its publication next month. The report says that the arrival of asylum groups across the UK, which has aroused racist tendencies within local populations, has led to expressions of racism (not to be confused with legitimate political debate on immigration policy) that should be challenged by the police. \"Where adequate evidence exists of criminal offences, consideration should be given to prosecute,\" the guide adds. The report was leaked as the Home Office published research showing that economic migration helps to fill labour market shortages, improve public finances, and contribute to the development of industries and jobs. The Acpo guide, drawn up with the help of Dutch police but in the main by the Kent force after their experience of clashes at Dover, says that with no action plan to manage tensions between the indigenous population and asylum seekers, significant racial tensions and public disorder may arise. Experience over the past four years showed that where asylum communities were established there was ill-informed adverse media coverage, which contributed to heightened tension and resentment. The guide says failure to achieve instead a \"positive media message may undermine much of the police service's efforts to maintain community harmony\". But it also warns that within refugee communities animosity is an \"ever present danger\" because of the mix of ethnic groups. It adds: \"Language and cultural barriers, along with a common misunderstanding of the role of the police, mean that asylum seekers are unlikely to report racist crimes and incidents. \"While the majority of asylum seekers have no criminal motives and wish to peacefully co-exist, some will use violence beyond our normal experience in retaliating to racist attacks, responding to criminal exploitation or resolving inter-ethnic disputes. \"Such violence will be best prevented by accurate intelligence profiles of criminals in asylum communities and racist offenders of all nationalities; and positive efforts to resolve crimes and tensions between asylum seekers.\" The chief constables say that all police forces should counter alarmist views that might fuel racism. It suggests getting \"key messages\" across to the local media, stressing that the area welcomes thousands of visitors a year; that asylum seekers are real people who need our urgent support and could make a valuable contribution to life; that Britain has a history of absorbing cultures; and that being an asylum seeker is no fun partly because of the new, restrictive asylum rules. With regard to the experiences of police in challenging unfounded media fears about an asylum crimewave, the report noted a case where a vicar, in a town with a large number of asylum seekers, made a public statement [saying] asylum seekers were taking housing and school places from locals. \"This was not the case,\" says the report. \"But because of his position in the community, the story made front page news. The story was highlighted by an extremist political party justifying and legitimising its position.\" Useful links SocietyGuardian special report on refugees ACPO guide to hate crime (pdf file) Kent constabulary Dutch police",

His announcement comes as he meets Tony Blair and the Welsh first minister, Rhodri Morgan, to discuss the imminent closures at the loss-making Llanwern steelworks in South Wales. The plant is owned by Corus which was formerly partly owned by British Steel. As many as 6,000 steelworker's jobs are under threat and ministers are pessimistic of their ability to dissuade the company from going ahead with the shutdown. An announcement is expected this week. One ministerial source said: \"We have tried to deal with the company's genuine problems, but the level of pressure from Corus shareholders is very high\". Ministers fear closures at Llanwern could be accompanied by job losses at the firm's Redcar plant, and even at the highly productive Nissan car plant on Tyneside. Any cutbacks are bound to be blamed on the strength of the pound, leading pro-Europeans to demand a clearer government commitment to join a single currency. In a speech today Mr Byers will stress the importance of manufacturing and announce details of an extra \u00a354m to a new regional innovation unit to be allocated to England's nine regional development agencies. The money is being allocated to the regions on the basis of their relative economic position. Previously, DTI regional money has been allocated on a flat rate basis across the nine regions according to population size. A DTI official said this represented the beginning of a new regional policy. Until now policy had been \"location blind\". As a result, the bulk of the money will go to the north east (\u00a38.9m), north west (\u00a37.4m) Yorkshire and Humberside (\u00a310m). Mr Byers will say: \"We cannot build a strong economy if we have a trail of underperforming areas. To succeed we need all parts of all our regions firing on all cylinders. \"This government intends to help areas tackle both historical regional disparities and re spond to the challenges of the modern, hi-tech, global economy\". He will also insist that the government is not just abandoning manufacturing, but recognises its continuing importance to the British economy. He will point out it accounts for about a fifth of national income with almost \u00a3150bn in output per year, and employs around 4m people directly and is the most dynamic sector of the economy. The RIF cash is being distributed for the first time on the basis of a region's GDP per capita, research and development spending and unemployment rates. In a speech welcomed in advance by the main manufacturing union, the AEEU, Mr Byers will announce that the cash will go to promote innovation and enterprise, and to support clusters and networks of businesses in their area.

These are not trivial questions that preoccupy a few moral theologians,\" he added. \"They are at the heart of our humanity.\" </p> <p>The deputy leader of the Tory peers, Lady Blatch, said she had lost her 14-year-old son to an illness compounded by his diabetes - one of the diseases which the research could cure - yet would still be opposing the government's order. Despite ministers' protestations, the science on stem cell research was \"anything but clear\", and the case for a select committee to question scientists further was \"overwhelming. </p> <p>\"Why is the government in such a hurry?\" she asked. \"Why is it that a matter of such importance isn't being dealt with through primary legislation?\" </p> <p>The Bishop of Oxford, one of 11 clerics who last week signed an open letter urging peers to support calls for a select committeee to consider the \"huge philosophical and ethical implications of these developments\", outlined the theological arguments for not regarding the pre-implantation embryo as having a soul, and described the early embryo as having a \"special status\", rather than an \"absolute status\". </p> <p>Research on this could only be morally justified, he argued, if it was \"the only way to achieve the desired knowledge, and if the knowledge was of such benefit that it outweighed this special status\". The real question, then, was whether it was really necessary to conduct the research on embryonic as opposed to adult stem cells - and the fact scientific opinion was divided on this justified a select committee. </p> <p>Lady Warnock, the cross-bencher who chaired the original inquiry into human fertilisation in the 1980s, said she \"deeply wished\" peers had had time to analyse the extension in the act in a select committee. \"I think there has been a mistake, I think we have been bullied and pushed to do things more quickly than we should and I deplore that,\" she said. </p> <p>While admitting she would still vote for the new research, she warned: \"There's a belief among the general public that a huge moral step is being taken and it's being taken without the benefit of normal parliamentary procedures. The word cloning sends shivers of horror down the spines of the British public ... the fear is that there will be no serious monitoring of research, that we will rush down the slope to the cloning of the whole human being.\" </p> <p>But the junior health minister, Lord Hunt, emphasised the order would not permit human reproductive cloning. The human fertilisation and embryology authority - which issues licences for stem cell research - would forbid it, and anyone without a licence could be imprisoned for 10 years. </p> <p>What a change to the act would permit, was an extension of the 1990 act to allow research into degenerative diseases - such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes and strokes - as well as into congenitive diseases and infertility. \"What you are being asked to do is to, in addition to research for effective contraception, in addition to research into congenital diseases, that embryos may be used to find treatments into serious and debilitating illnesses which affect literally millions of people,\" he said.</p>",

Despite ministers' protestations, the science on stem cell research was \"anything but clear\", and the case for a select committee to question scientists further was \"overwhelming. \"Why is the government in such a hurry?\" she asked. \"Why is it that a matter of such importance isn't being dealt with through primary legislation?\" The Bishop of Oxford, one of 11 clerics who last week signed an open letter urging peers to support calls for a select committeee to consider the \"huge philosophical and ethical implications of these developments\", outlined the theological arguments for not regarding the pre-implantation embryo as having a soul, and described the early embryo as having a \"special status\", rather than an \"absolute status\". Research on this could only be morally justified, he argued, if it was \"the only way to achieve the desired knowledge, and if the knowledge was of such benefit that it outweighed this special status\". The real question, then, was whether it was really necessary to conduct the research on embryonic as opposed to adult stem cells - and the fact scientific opinion was divided on this justified a select committee. Lady Warnock, the cross-bencher who chaired the original inquiry into human fertilisation in the 1980s, said she \"deeply wished\" peers had had time to analyse the extension in the act in a select committee. \"I think there has been a mistake, I think we have been bullied and pushed to do things more quickly than we should and I deplore that,\" she said. While admitting she would still vote for the new research, she warned: \"There's a belief among the general public that a huge moral step is being taken and it's being taken without the benefit of normal parliamentary procedures. The word cloning sends shivers of horror down the spines of the British public ... the fear is that there will be no serious monitoring of research, that we will rush down the slope to the cloning of the whole human being.\" But the junior health minister, Lord Hunt, emphasised the order would not permit human reproductive cloning. The human fertilisation and embryology authority - which issues licences for stem cell research - would forbid it, and anyone without a licence could be imprisoned for 10 years. What a change to the act would permit, was an extension of the 1990 act to allow research into degenerative diseases - such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, diabetes and strokes - as well as into congenitive diseases and infertility. \"What you are being asked to do is to, in addition to research for effective contraception, in addition to research into congenital diseases, that embryos may be used to find treatments into serious and debilitating illnesses which affect literally millions of people,\" he said.",

The chief medical officer, Liam Donaldson, called together medical organisations, including the Royal College of Nursing and the British Medical Association, to express their confidence in the vaccination in the face of claims that it could be linked to bowel disease and autism in certain susceptible children. The three-year controversy over the MMR jab, given to babies at 18 months and followed by a pre-school booster, has surfaced again with a paper written by Andrew Wakefield from the inflammatory bowel disease study group at the Royal Free Hospital in London and a colleague. In February 1998 Dr Wakefield and colleagues published papers in the Lancet describ ing a link between the live measles virus used in the vaccine, damage to the gut and autism. In the latest paper, to be published in the journal Adverse Drug Reactions, Dr Wakefield questions the clinical trials assessing the safety of the combined MMR vaccine before it was introduced in Britain in 1988.

They should be left in no doubt after today's summit that the advice from doctors, nurses and every major health organisation is that they should have their child vaccinated with MMR.\" The professional institutions issued a statement confirming this was their view. \"The paper adds little to current knowledge. Our professional confidence in the MMR vaccine, its safety and effectiveness remains fully justified - there is a large body of evidence showing that the combined vaccine is highly effective and serious side effects are uncommon.\"",

Mrs Beckham said she told him that if he found other items he should contact her security man. She also told him about a silver picture frame containing a photograph of David with Brooklyn on his shoulders which her husband had given her. Oliver told her he was going back to the rubbish dump and Mrs Beckham should call him back five minutes later, she said. When she rang back their conversation was, as the prosecution put it, a \"pantomime\". Mrs Beckham described how he had given the impression he was climbing over a wall into the tip. Within 30 seconds he had found the frame. In June police officers searched the house of Oliver's parents and found Mrs Beckham's clothes in his sister Sadie's wardrobe. Mrs Beckham was shown the clothes which were recovered. They included a Ralph Lauren denim jacket, three jackets by Plein Sud, and two glittery vest tops. But most attention was paid to a sparkly three-piece Ralph Lauren swimming costume - exhibit five. The bikini top and sarong were recovered but the bikini bottoms remained missing. The prosecution pointed out, all the bottoms were missing. Mrs Beckham estimated that they would be worth between \u00a3700 and \u00a3800 and pointed out that most had only been worn once or twice. Oliver said he was not a \"designer label\" man. He insisted he found the items in bags left on the back of his truck. But he admitted that he had not gone back to the tip to hunt for the frame but into his parents' garage. He said he had left them there because his mother did car boot sales. He admitted he had been excited to speak to Mrs Beckham. Oliver also said that Mrs Beckham's security man had told him when he picked up the picture frame that he would not get a reward because she was a \"bit tight\". Oliver said: \"If I had known the clothing was Mrs Beckham's, I would have returned it to her.\" Oliver, of Stanwell Village, Middlesex, denies theft and two alternative charges of handling stolen goods. The trial continues.",

The tribunal ruled that Capt Clapson should be reinstated had to the position he held immediately before he was sacked, which was co-pilot, and gave British Airways until May 1 to reinstate him.

Although he has yet to reveal his peace plan in full, he has declared the Oslo peace process of the past seven years as dead and buried, and said he will not honour any agreement produced at the Israeli-Palestinian talks now under way in the Egyptian resort of Taba, on the Red Sea. Instead, Mr Sharon forsees a series of interim agreements, with no further transfers of territory, and the Palestinians confined to the 42% of the West Bank that they currently control. The exposure of the two faces of the Likud leader is a godsend for Mr Barak, whose dwindling band of supporters are fighting a desperate campaign to remind Israelis of the former general's past. \"For those who thought for a moment that Sharon had changed, the mask has blown up in our faces, and what has been revealed behind it is his true face,\" a statement from Mr Barak's campaign office said. Their efforts got another boost yesterday when Mr Sharon was publicly confronted by an Israeli teenager who blamed him for her father's deep psychological scars from serving as a soldier in Lebanon.",

      "bodyText": "European Union diplomats in Athens complained yesterday that the Greek authorities are stalling on requests for security changes to protect embassy employees, made in the wake of the murder of Brigadier Stephen Saunders. The delays are doing little to assuage growing doubts about Greece's ability to crack down on political violence and terrorism ahead of the 2004 Olympic Games in the capital. Greece has long been regarded as a weak link in the international fight against terrorism. But foreign diplomats in Athens have become increasingly nervous since Sunday night, when a remote-controlled bomb injured Vassilios Michaloliakos, a rightwing member of parliament. No group or person has claimed responsibility for the explosion, which left the opposition MP with facial and chest injuries. But police were yesterday investigating the possibility that it was the work of November 17, the elusive terrorist group responsible for the murder of Saunders, the British military attache in Athens, on June 8. There have been no arrests nor firm leads during a 25-year spell of bombings, rocket attacks and shootings by the November 17 group, which has killed 22 people and injured more than 100. The murder of Saunders sent a shock-wave through the diplomatic community here, prompting western and European embassies to begin an urgent review of their security measures. Diplomats in Athens have been a frequent target for the group, which espouses an explosive mix of Marxism and extreme nationalism. Foreign missions, however, have also borne attacks by other, less lethal, anti-western or anarchist fringe groups. Diplomatic vehicles and those belonging to western businesses are regularly the target of firebombs; the Italian embassy has had eight cars set alight in the past two years. European diplomats cite \"bureaucratic foot-dragging\" and \"a lack of attention\" by the Greek authorities in dealing with their safety concerns. The British embassy, for example, is pressing for the relaxation of rules which limit the number of armour-plated cars permitted for personal protection; the car that Saunders was driving when he was murdered was not reinforced. The Greek government allows one armoured car for every three diplomatic staff. Britain is thought to have asked for an extra three cars to add to their pool. Foreign embassies in London, by contrast, are allowed one armoured car for each diplomat. Other embassies, including those of Germany, Belgium and Italy, have been frustrated by the progress of applications for Greek number plates, which would make their vehicles less of a target. They are also perplexed by the lack of clear guidelines on extra police guards for senior embassy staff. \"It does not give a good message,\" one EU diplomat said. \"Security and safety is supposed to be the government's top priority.

Martin Griffiths, Stagecoach's financial director, said that Prestwick would not be thriving today without Stagecoach. The sale of the airport was consistent with its strategy of focusing on road and rail. The Prestwick acquisition is the starting point for Omniport's wider ambitions. It is already the preferred bidder for a management contract to run Pease airport in Boston.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A kiss on the cheek ended fashion's most talked about feud yesterday as designer Calvin Klein settled his acrimonious trademark dispute with Linda Wachner, head of clothing manufacturer Warnaco. </p> <p>The financial details were not disclosed but both sides professed themselves happy that a court battle expected to last four weeks and to generate acres of negative newsprint had been dismissed within minutes of the case opening. </p> <p>Speaking outside the Manhattan courtroom, Mr Klein told the Guardian: \"The agreement is confidential, but all I can tell you is that I am very happy.\" </p> <p>Ms Wachner, who owns 20% of Warnaco, appeared equally relieved that the eight-month legal battle was over. \"It's good for the brand and good for business,\" she said. </p> <p>Mr Klein had sued Ms Wachner and her firm for breaching the terms of a contract to produce and sell his jeans and hurting the value of his brandname. After he called her a \"cancer\" in his lawsuit, and vulgar on primetime television, Ms Warnaco countersued. </p> <p>Things turned even nastier last week when Mr Klein launched a separate attempt to have the licence terminated because of Warnaco's heavy debt burden and falling share price. Warnaco shares have fallen from $13.50 (\u00a39.22) to a low of $1.25 since May. Yesterday, they rose almost $1 on the news to more than $3. </p> <p>Mr Klein appeared to have won his battle against Warnaco's use of discount retailers to sell his jeans. </p> <p>A joint statement said: \"The parties look forward to expanding jeanswear sales consistent with the image and prestige of the Calvin Klein products and to expanding and concentrating the distribution of Calvin Klein jeanswear products in department and specialty stores.\" </p> <p>The licensing agreement is worth hundreds of millions of dollars to both sides. The statement added that settlement would \"protect and promote the integrity and success of the Calvin Klein brand for their mutual benefit and the benefit of other Calvin Klein licensees\". </p> <p>People familiar with the matter suggested tensions became particularly acute after Mr Klein tried to sell his company last year and found buyers unwilling to take on the long-term agreement. Mr Klein denied that the settlement had changed his mind over a possible sale. \"The company is not for sale,\" he said. </p> <p>Both claim and counter-claim were settled yesterday. However, last week's filing in a state court has been postponed rather than settled outright, according to David Boies, attorney for Mr Klein. Warnaco has been given a year to bring its debt to equity ratio within the terms of the licence. </p> <p>Both sides seemed slightly surprised that a deal had been reached. Mr Klein referred to \"not just 11th hour but 11.59\". </p> <p>Even the clothes the protagonists wore to court appeared to suggest the gulf between them. The 58-year-old Mr Klein arrived in a grey suit with matching shirt and tie. Ms Wachner, aged 54, wore a leopard-print scarf over a baggy black jacket and sported red-framed glasses. </p> <p>There was some regret among the lawyers that the trial had been aborted. </p> <p>Mr Boies said: \"This was going to be a good case. [It involved] fascinating people, an interesting industry, charges and counter-charges. But the fact of the matter is that we are in the trial business and Calvin Klein, Barry Schwartz and Linda Wachner are in the jeanswear business and fundamentally what's best for business has got to take precedence.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A kiss on the cheek ended fashion's most talked about feud yesterday as designer Calvin Klein settled his acrimonious trademark dispute with Linda Wachner, head of clothing manufacturer Warnaco. The financial details were not disclosed but both sides professed themselves happy that a court battle expected to last four weeks and to generate acres of negative newsprint had been dismissed within minutes of the case opening. Speaking outside the Manhattan courtroom, Mr Klein told the Guardian: \"The agreement is confidential, but all I can tell you is that I am very happy.\" Ms Wachner, who owns 20% of Warnaco, appeared equally relieved that the eight-month legal battle was over. \"It's good for the brand and good for business,\" she said. Mr Klein had sued Ms Wachner and her firm for breaching the terms of a contract to produce and sell his jeans and hurting the value of his brandname. After he called her a \"cancer\" in his lawsuit, and vulgar on primetime television, Ms Warnaco countersued. Things turned even nastier last week when Mr Klein launched a separate attempt to have the licence terminated because of Warnaco's heavy debt burden and falling share price. Warnaco shares have fallen from $13.50 (\u00a39.22) to a low of $1.25 since May. Yesterday, they rose almost $1 on the news to more than $3. Mr Klein appeared to have won his battle against Warnaco's use of discount retailers to sell his jeans. A joint statement said: \"The parties look forward to expanding jeanswear sales consistent with the image and prestige of the Calvin Klein products and to expanding and concentrating the distribution of Calvin Klein jeanswear products in department and specialty stores.\" The licensing agreement is worth hundreds of millions of dollars to both sides. The statement added that settlement would \"protect and promote the integrity and success of the Calvin Klein brand for their mutual benefit and the benefit of other Calvin Klein licensees\". People familiar with the matter suggested tensions became particularly acute after Mr Klein tried to sell his company last year and found buyers unwilling to take on the long-term agreement. Mr Klein denied that the settlement had changed his mind over a possible sale. \"The company is not for sale,\" he said. Both claim and counter-claim were settled yesterday. However, last week's filing in a state court has been postponed rather than settled outright, according to David Boies, attorney for Mr Klein. Warnaco has been given a year to bring its debt to equity ratio within the terms of the licence. Both sides seemed slightly surprised that a deal had been reached. Mr Klein referred to \"not just 11th hour but 11.59\". Even the clothes the protagonists wore to court appeared to suggest the gulf between them. The 58-year-old Mr Klein arrived in a grey suit with matching shirt and tie. Ms Wachner, aged 54, wore a leopard-print scarf over a baggy black jacket and sported red-framed glasses. There was some regret among the lawyers that the trial had been aborted. Mr Boies said: \"This was going to be a good case. [It involved] fascinating people, an interesting industry, charges and counter-charges. But the fact of the matter is that we are in the trial business and Calvin Klein, Barry Schwartz and Linda Wachner are in the jeanswear business and fundamentally what's best for business has got to take precedence.\"",

      "body": "<p>A celebrated violinist and teacher, Anne Macnaghten, who has died aged 92, was best known for the Macnaghten concerts, a series she founded in 1931 with the composer Elisabeth Lutyens and the conductor Iris Lemare to champion the works of young, unknown contemporary composers.</p> <p>The all-female Macnaghten String Quartet, founded by Anne in the same year, was the focus of many of the performances. Britten's Sinfonietta, Op 1, was premiered at one such concert in 1933, as was Michael Tippett's First String Quartet (1935), and Gerald Finzi, Elizabeth Maconchy and Alan Rawsthorne were among the many other composers whose works had their first hearing as part of the concerts. Ralph Vaughan Williams was one of their most vocal supporters.</p> <p>The Macnaghten Quartet reformed in 1947, with Arnold Ashby as cellist, and Macnaghten married him in the same year. Under her direction, the ensemble stimulated children's interest in listening to music through demonstration concerts in schools, a cause to which she was passionately committed from 1947-78, in Barking, then Ealing, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire.</p> <p>An inspirational and generous teacher, Macnaghten had many private pupils through out her life. At 70, she began tutoring adult amateur players at the Macnaghten String Quartet Weekends, run by the Benslow Music Trust in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, only stopping as a result of a fall she suffered two years ago.</p> <p>Although music was her first love, her political beliefs were also deeply important to her: the dogmatic streak which came from her commitment to Marxism gave her the determination to stand up for her principles, both musical and political.</p> <p>Anne Macnaghten was the youngest daughter of Sir Malcolm Martin Macnaghten, MP for Londonderry from 1922 to 1928 and a high court judge. She and her sisters, Mary and Bridget, lived a privileged life in Kensington and Northern Ireland; all three rebelled against their middle-class background and adopted socialist beliefs.</p> <p>Anne began learning the violin at the age of six with the celebrated soloist Jelly d'Aranyi. \"She wasn't really a very good teacher,\" Macnaghten told the Strad magazine in 1983, \"but she had a terrific temperament as a player. She made a tremendous impact on me.\"</p> <p>Her music lessons stopped during the second world war, but from the age of 10 she had lessons with Oliver Williams. Anxious to follow in her sisters' footsteps and live abroad, she went to study with Walther Davisson at the Leipzig Conservatory in 1925, at the age of 17, although her studies there ended abruptly after two years, when her mother, displeased at a reported liaison with another student, arrived to take her home.</p> <p>Back in Britain, a chance meeting with Lutyens in 1931 led to the founding of the Macnaghten concerts, based at the Ballet Club Theatre (later the Mercury Theatre) in London's Notting Hill Gate. Female composers featured prominently in the series: Macnaghten always said this was not due to feminist concerns, but because women found the most difficulty in getting their works heard. From 1932, the series was known as the Macnaghten-Lemare concerts, and from 1935-37, when Lemare ran them on her own, they were renamed the Lemare concerts.</p> <p>They resumed again in 1952 under the auspices of the newly-formed Macnaghten New Music Group, with Vaughan Williams as president. With the help of Arts Council funding, the concerts continued for many years, and though Anne Macnaghten ended her direct involvement with the organisation in 1978, the last New Macnaghten concert season was held in 1994, having commissioned works by many British composers, including Harrison Birtwistle and Richard Rodney Bennett.</p> <p>Macnaghten's political ideals were a subject close to her heart as her first husband, Ernest Skilbeck (whom she married in 1942 and who died in 1947) had fought against Franco in the Spanish civil war.

      "bodyText": "A celebrated violinist and teacher, Anne Macnaghten, who has died aged 92, was best known for the Macnaghten concerts, a series she founded in 1931 with the composer Elisabeth Lutyens and the conductor Iris Lemare to champion the works of young, unknown contemporary composers. The all-female Macnaghten String Quartet, founded by Anne in the same year, was the focus of many of the performances. Britten's Sinfonietta, Op 1, was premiered at one such concert in 1933, as was Michael Tippett's First String Quartet (1935), and Gerald Finzi, Elizabeth Maconchy and Alan Rawsthorne were among the many other composers whose works had their first hearing as part of the concerts. Ralph Vaughan Williams was one of their most vocal supporters. The Macnaghten Quartet reformed in 1947, with Arnold Ashby as cellist, and Macnaghten married him in the same year. Under her direction, the ensemble stimulated children's interest in listening to music through demonstration concerts in schools, a cause to which she was passionately committed from 1947-78, in Barking, then Ealing, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire. An inspirational and generous teacher, Macnaghten had many private pupils through out her life. At 70, she began tutoring adult amateur players at the Macnaghten String Quartet Weekends, run by the Benslow Music Trust in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, only stopping as a result of a fall she suffered two years ago. Although music was her first love, her political beliefs were also deeply important to her: the dogmatic streak which came from her commitment to Marxism gave her the determination to stand up for her principles, both musical and political. Anne Macnaghten was the youngest daughter of Sir Malcolm Martin Macnaghten, MP for Londonderry from 1922 to 1928 and a high court judge. She and her sisters, Mary and Bridget, lived a privileged life in Kensington and Northern Ireland; all three rebelled against their middle-class background and adopted socialist beliefs. Anne began learning the violin at the age of six with the celebrated soloist Jelly d'Aranyi. \"She wasn't really a very good teacher,\" Macnaghten told the Strad magazine in 1983, \"but she had a terrific temperament as a player. She made a tremendous impact on me.\" Her music lessons stopped during the second world war, but from the age of 10 she had lessons with Oliver Williams. Anxious to follow in her sisters' footsteps and live abroad, she went to study with Walther Davisson at the Leipzig Conservatory in 1925, at the age of 17, although her studies there ended abruptly after two years, when her mother, displeased at a reported liaison with another student, arrived to take her home. Back in Britain, a chance meeting with Lutyens in 1931 led to the founding of the Macnaghten concerts, based at the Ballet Club Theatre (later the Mercury Theatre) in London's Notting Hill Gate. Female composers featured prominently in the series: Macnaghten always said this was not due to feminist concerns, but because women found the most difficulty in getting their works heard. From 1932, the series was known as the Macnaghten-Lemare concerts, and from 1935-37, when Lemare ran them on her own, they were renamed the Lemare concerts. They resumed again in 1952 under the auspices of the newly-formed Macnaghten New Music Group, with Vaughan Williams as president. With the help of Arts Council funding, the concerts continued for many years, and though Anne Macnaghten ended her direct involvement with the organisation in 1978, the last New Macnaghten concert season was held in 1994, having commissioned works by many British composers, including Harrison Birtwistle and Richard Rodney Bennett. Macnaghten's political ideals were a subject close to her heart as her first husband, Ernest Skilbeck (whom she married in 1942 and who died in 1947) had fought against Franco in the Spanish civil war. She campaigned during the second world war to open a second front to relieve the Nazi attack on the Soviet Union. In the early 1980s, she left the Communist party to join her local Labour party, for which she was still delivering election leaflets at the age of 90. In 1962, Anne Macnaghten received the gold medal from the Worshipful Company of Musicians for services to chamber music, and in 1987 she was awarded the CBE in recognition of her lifetime's work. Her second husband, Arnold, died in 1994. She is survived by a son, John, and a daughter, Catherine. \u0095 Anne Macnaghten, violinist and teacher, born August 9 1908; died December 31 2000.",

      "bodyText": "European Union foreign policy goals are being formulated in a \"bureaucratic exercise\" that lacks coherence, flexibility and effectiveness, according to a candid internal critique by the top official involved. In a confidential document circulated to member states, Javier Solana, the EU's \"high representative\" for foreign and security policy, admitted that common strategies setting out the EU's policy towards regions such as Russia, Ukraine, the Balkans and the Mediterranean had failed to produce \"a stronger and more effective EU in international affairs\". If the shortcomings were not corrected, he added in the document dated December 21, \"we will widen even further the gap between [the strategies'] poor effectiveness on the one hand and on the other hand the high expectations they raise\". Mr Solana told reporters later that the system had to be radically overhauled if the EU was going to tackle foreign policy \"in real time, without waiting for meetings\". Mr Solana, a former Nato secretary general, works for the union's council of ministers, where the 15 member governments cooperate. It is his job to try to give Europe a single voice so it can act more effectively on the world stage, especially with regard to the US, in a way that reflects its economic strength. But he has faced difficulties and frustrations since taking up his newly-created post last year, including repeated suggestions that his functions should be absorbed into Romano Prodi's supranational European commission. Chris Patten, the British commissioner who is in charge of external relations, has also expressed concerns about a lack of coherence in the EU's foreign and aid policy-making. European Union diplomats regularly complain that governments are not giving Mr Solana enough power. Mr Solana is also responsible for the EU's new rapid reaction force (RRF) of up to 60,000 troops, intended to be sent on peacekeeping and humanitarian missions where Nato as a whole is not involved. Critics of the RRF say it may end up undermining the western alliance, and may seize on Mr Solana's admission of difficulties with foreign policy-making to strengthen their opposition to the force. The document was leaked as foreign ministers met to review European union mechanisms for conflict prevention, a high priority as the Swedish assume the presidency of the group . \"Solana is trying to add some reality to a debate which is otherwise just too woolly,\" said one diplomat, admitting that the report was a frank account of widely recognised problems. Mr Solana lamented in his critique that the EU's foreign policy documents were often so \"thoroughly negotiated among the member states that they do not contain real priorities\". No doubt they are useful as reference documents, he added, but they have tended to become \"increasingly a bureaucratic exercise\". \"No sense of priority or urgency emerges from them at the political level. In the end it becomes difficult to distinguish priorities from questions of secondary importance,\" he said. In the debate on conflict prevention, held in public, the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, called for fresh efforts to ensure that exports of small arms only go to \"legitimate governments\" and not to rebels. In Britain the government has come under renewed criticism for not doing enough to implement the findings of the Scott enquiry into the arms for Iraq scandal. \"Africa has more conflicts than any other continent in the world and it is significant that Africa is the only continent in the world where per capita GDP has declined over the past decade,\" Mr Cook said. \u0095 Duncan Campbell, the British investigative journalist, told a European parliament committee yesterday that since 1993, electronic espionage by the US-led Echelon surveillance system had allowed American companies to win up to $26bn of contracts that might otherwise have gone to European rivals, including firms in Britain.

One of the main obstacles to anyone becoming a magistrate is firms who do not allow their employees to partake of public duties. The magistracy can only be as efficient as society lets it be. Instead of the constant attacks on the magistracy, why don't you try to persuade employers of the benefits of having a magistrate in their midst? <br><b> Fiona Williams</b><br>Birmingham</p> <p>Our experience suggests that the idea of lay magistrates led by professional judges should be a promising way forward.

The steady trickle of unfairly imprisoned lorry drivers and the cases of Bridget Seisay (people trafficking) and Mark Forrester (football hooliganism) are a warning to those advocating extensions of the use of district judges sitting alone. <br><b> Stephen Jakobi</b><br>Director, Fair Trials Abroad<br><a href=\"mailto:StephenJakobi@compuserve.com\">StephenJakobi@compuserve.com</a></p>",

The savings on replacing 10,000 unpaid lay magistrates would be minimal Apart from costs, there are many good reasons for retaining the lay magistracy, regardless of any shortcomings. Lay magistrates provide community justice: they are ordinary people who live and work in the local community and who have an intimate knowledge of that community.

One of the main obstacles to anyone becoming a magistrate is firms who do not allow their employees to partake of public duties. The magistracy can only be as efficient as society lets it be. Instead of the constant attacks on the magistracy, why don't you try to persuade employers of the benefits of having a magistrate in their midst? Fiona Williams Birmingham Our experience suggests that the idea of lay magistrates led by professional judges should be a promising way forward. In northern Europe the distinguishing factor is mixed professional and lay participation in first instance decisions. Denmark and Germany appear to manage as well as any with assessors led by professional judges. On the other hand our experience of French and particularly Belgian justice would demonstrate the dangers of professional judges sitting alone or together. The steady trickle of unfairly imprisoned lorry drivers and the cases of Bridget Seisay (people trafficking) and Mark Forrester (football hooliganism) are a warning to those advocating extensions of the use of district judges sitting alone.

But by the official tally, widely seen as too low, the Russians are being killed at the rate of more than 160 a month, with almost 500 being wounded as the rebels use ruthless hit-and-run tactics.</p> <p>Its principal garrison Gudermes, long under ostensible Russian control and the headquarters for the civil administration of Chechnya, is the latest battleground, according to Russian media yesterday.</p> <p>Guerrillas attacked the main hospital on Sunday, keeping Russian troops under fire for eight hours before melting away into the darkness. According to the Chechens, they left 20 Russian soldiers dead. Moscow admitted losing four soldiers and confirmed that many were injured in a cafe bomb blast in Gudermes.</p> <p>The guerrillas are also targeting \"collaborationist\" members of the pro-Moscow Chechen administration and its local supporters every week.</p> <p>The lightning speed of the attack highlights the vulnerability of the Russian conscripts, who hole up each evening in converted schools and public buildings, surrounded by mines and barbed wire. They live in fear of the rebels who attack checkpoints, mine roads and ambush Russian convoys.</p> <p>Sergei Ponomarenko, a Russian who recently resigned as a local government chief in Chechnya, told the newspaper Izvestiya that the guerrillas - who routinely ignore curfews and distribute propaganda leaflets \"to show who's really boss\" - have seized the initiative.</p> <p>When Chechen snipers hit a Russian, Moscow's forces commonly respond with indiscriminate artillery barrages which maim and kill civilians or launch \"cleansing\" raids on villages and towns, dragging away males of fighting age.</p> <p>\"This has turned into a war against an entire civilian population. That's a fact, that's the reality,\" Ruslan Khasbulatov, a former Russian parliamentary leader and himself a Chechen, told the Russian government recently.</p> <p>Russian or loyalist Chechen administrators and military officers, meanwhile, are using their positions to line their pockets, Mr Ponomarenko said, an assertion echoed by Mr Khasbulatov who said the generals wanted the war to go on because of the opportunities for plundering and profiteering.</p> <p>Mr Putin's move yesterday may be an attempt to break this cycle of viciousness and seal a victory in Chechnya. But it also seems a counsel of despair. The president recently described Chechnya as the source of \"Russia's national shame\". It also propelled him to power in 1999.</p> <p>Yesterday's move was a snub to the army generals who, according to Mr Khasbulatov, are deliberately prolonging the war to enhance their clout in Russian politics and to exact retribution for their defeat in the last Chechen war of 1994-96.</p> <p>In a decree that took immediate effect, Mr Putin put Mr Patrushev, who succeeded him as head of the FSB in 1999, in charge. The transfer of command was seen as another sign of the growing power of the security services under Mr Putin, a former career KGB officer.</p> <p>The Kremlin also announced troop cuts in Chechnya, making it plain that the emphasis would be on the use of elite \"anti-terrorist\" FSB and crack army units. All the signs are that there will be a strong Russian spring offensive to end the war by May and proclaim victory.</p> <p>With no political solution in sight and scant effort made to find one, public support for the war is ebbing and Mr Putin may be calculating that he needs to settle.</p> <p>Mr Putin has instructed that the troops numbers be cut. \"I have decided today on a partial withdrawal from the republic,\" he declared yesterday. \"This does not mean the end of the counter-terrorism operation. On the contrary it will be continued, not less intensively, but with different means and forces and with a different emphasis.\" The war would now be waged by \"FSB and interior ministry forces and defence ministry special units\".</p> <p>A motorised infantry division of 15,000 men and a 7,000-strong brigade of interior ministry troops would remain deployed. It was not clear how many troops were being pulled out or when.</p> <p>Mr Putin also talked up the possibilities of implementing new civil administration plans to revive the economy. The plan is to plough \u00a360m into Chechnya reconstruction this year.</p> <p>But Russian civilian administrators are currently quitting their posts in frustration at the Kremlin and the military, complaining that no money is available for the restoration of the most rudimentary services and that anything of value in Chechnya is plundered by the Russian troops.</p> <p>Mr Putin stated recently that his priority in Chechnya was \"social rehabilitation and economic recovery\", but a senior Kremlin aide told Mr Ponomarenko: \"There is no programme yet for restoring the republic, so there's no point putting any money in.\"</p> <p>The president said the command was being passed to the FSB since constitutionally this is the body charged with combating terrorism. It is true that by law the army is for fighting foreign wars and defending against external aggression rather than to crush domestic insurgency, but in Chechnya such niceties have been ignored for the past 16 months.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sixteen months into Russia's savage war of attrition in Chechnya and with no end in sight, President Vladimir Putin yesterday stripped his army generals of their command of the campaign and put the domestic security service, the main successor to the KGB, in charge of the Chechnya war. In what appeared to be a vote of no confidence in the generals' ability to tame the Chechen rebels, despite repeated bragging that they have been crushed, Mr Putin put a close ally, Nikolai Patrushev, head of the FSB (domestic security service), in command and ordered him to report on his progress by mid-May. Moscow says it has 80,000 troops in Chechnya struggling to contain what it puts at 1,000 guerrillas. But by the official tally, widely seen as too low, the Russians are being killed at the rate of more than 160 a month, with almost 500 being wounded as the rebels use ruthless hit-and-run tactics. Its principal garrison Gudermes, long under ostensible Russian control and the headquarters for the civil administration of Chechnya, is the latest battleground, according to Russian media yesterday. Guerrillas attacked the main hospital on Sunday, keeping Russian troops under fire for eight hours before melting away into the darkness. According to the Chechens, they left 20 Russian soldiers dead. Moscow admitted losing four soldiers and confirmed that many were injured in a cafe bomb blast in Gudermes. The guerrillas are also targeting \"collaborationist\" members of the pro-Moscow Chechen administration and its local supporters every week. The lightning speed of the attack highlights the vulnerability of the Russian conscripts, who hole up each evening in converted schools and public buildings, surrounded by mines and barbed wire. They live in fear of the rebels who attack checkpoints, mine roads and ambush Russian convoys. Sergei Ponomarenko, a Russian who recently resigned as a local government chief in Chechnya, told the newspaper Izvestiya that the guerrillas - who routinely ignore curfews and distribute propaganda leaflets \"to show who's really boss\" - have seized the initiative. When Chechen snipers hit a Russian, Moscow's forces commonly respond with indiscriminate artillery barrages which maim and kill civilians or launch \"cleansing\" raids on villages and towns, dragging away males of fighting age. \"This has turned into a war against an entire civilian population. That's a fact, that's the reality,\" Ruslan Khasbulatov, a former Russian parliamentary leader and himself a Chechen, told the Russian government recently. Russian or loyalist Chechen administrators and military officers, meanwhile, are using their positions to line their pockets, Mr Ponomarenko said, an assertion echoed by Mr Khasbulatov who said the generals wanted the war to go on because of the opportunities for plundering and profiteering. Mr Putin's move yesterday may be an attempt to break this cycle of viciousness and seal a victory in Chechnya. But it also seems a counsel of despair. The president recently described Chechnya as the source of \"Russia's national shame\". It also propelled him to power in 1999. Yesterday's move was a snub to the army generals who, according to Mr Khasbulatov, are deliberately prolonging the war to enhance their clout in Russian politics and to exact retribution for their defeat in the last Chechen war of 1994-96. In a decree that took immediate effect, Mr Putin put Mr Patrushev, who succeeded him as head of the FSB in 1999, in charge. The transfer of command was seen as another sign of the growing power of the security services under Mr Putin, a former career KGB officer. The Kremlin also announced troop cuts in Chechnya, making it plain that the emphasis would be on the use of elite \"anti-terrorist\" FSB and crack army units. All the signs are that there will be a strong Russian spring offensive to end the war by May and proclaim victory. With no political solution in sight and scant effort made to find one, public support for the war is ebbing and Mr Putin may be calculating that he needs to settle. Mr Putin has instructed that the troops numbers be cut. \"I have decided today on a partial withdrawal from the republic,\" he declared yesterday. \"This does not mean the end of the counter-terrorism operation. On the contrary it will be continued, not less intensively, but with different means and forces and with a different emphasis.\" The war would now be waged by \"FSB and interior ministry forces and defence ministry special units\". A motorised infantry division of 15,000 men and a 7,000-strong brigade of interior ministry troops would remain deployed. It was not clear how many troops were being pulled out or when. Mr Putin also talked up the possibilities of implementing new civil administration plans to revive the economy. The plan is to plough \u00a360m into Chechnya reconstruction this year. But Russian civilian administrators are currently quitting their posts in frustration at the Kremlin and the military, complaining that no money is available for the restoration of the most rudimentary services and that anything of value in Chechnya is plundered by the Russian troops. Mr Putin stated recently that his priority in Chechnya was \"social rehabilitation and economic recovery\", but a senior Kremlin aide told Mr Ponomarenko: \"There is no programme yet for restoring the republic, so there's no point putting any money in.\" The president said the command was being passed to the FSB since constitutionally this is the body charged with combating terrorism. It is true that by law the army is for fighting foreign wars and defending against external aggression rather than to crush domestic insurgency, but in Chechnya such niceties have been ignored for the past 16 months.",

In a career that spanned almost 40 years, from 1942 to 1981, he was at the forefront of electronics, and of the computing revolution that he himself kick-started by providing the first example of computer software. By leading the design and development of five major computer systems, he put Manchester at the heart of this second industrial revolution.</p> <p>Born in Dewsbury, Yorkshire, Kilburn was educated at Wheelwright grammar school, where he enjoyed mathematics and sport, particularly running, and Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, where, from 1941, he read mathematics. While there, he was invited to a lecture by CP Snow - an event that determined the direction of his future life. Snow told the students that \"interesting\" work was available to them to help the war effort and, in order to prepare for it, they should take a course in electronics and join the home guard.</p> <p>This Kilburn did. When he left Cambridge in 1942, he was sent to the telecommunications research establishment (TRE) billeted at Malvern. There he joined FC Williams, who led a group with responsibility for solving problems in existing electronics circuitry in radar and other key areas. They worked in Malvern school's cricket pavilion.</p> <p>After the war, while still at the TRE, Williams and Kilburn realised that the lack of a suitable storage mechanism was holding up the development of electronic computers worldwide. They began to investigate the possibility of using cathode ray tubes (CRTs) to do this. When Williams took up the chair of electrotechnics at the University of Manchester in December 1946, he asked Kilburn to go with him. A year later, Kilburn, having built working prototypes, wrote a definitive report explaining how a CRT could be used as an electronic storage device.</p> <p>To show convincingly that it would work in practice, he and GC Tootill then designed and built a computer with a store size of 32 words and some 650 valves; it was 16ft long, weighed half a tonne, and was affectionately known as the Baby. It worked successfully for the first time on June 21 1948. Using simple hand keys, a program was loaded into its memory and then the stored program was executed. This, probably the only complete program Kilburn ever wrote, was the first example of computer software. And so the age of the modern computer was born.</p> <p>The government of the day was so impressed that ministers instructed the defence company Ferranti Ltd to construct an enhanced computer in collaboration with Williams and Kilburn. The CRT storage system (called the Williams tube in the United States) was used by computer systems around the world for a number of years, before being superseded by core store.</p> <p>At the University of Manchester, Kilburn led the developments based on the Baby. By 1949, a full-sized machine, the Manchester mark 1, was being used to support a small number of users, including Alan Turing, who had taken up a mathematics post at the university in September 1948. The machine was also the prototype of the computer that Ferranti released as the world's first commercially-produced computer in February 1951.</p> <p>A succession of computers followed, keeping the University of Manchester at the forefront of computer design worldwide. In 1953, the world's first transistorised computer was commercialised as the Metro Vickers MV950. In 1954, MEG, probably the world's first computer to support floating-point arithmetic, was called Mercury when Ferranti marketed it. Atlas (1962) was the world's most powerful machine of its time. Finally, MU5 (1972) introduced new concepts that were adopted as the basis for the advanced 2900 computer series developed by ICL.</p> <p>The Atlas exemplifies how developments carried out by Kilburn and his team introduced key new concepts into computing. In this case, innovations included virtual memory, multi-programming, advanced operating systems, read-only memory and the compiler-compiler.</p> <p>Kilburn was appointed professor of computer engineering in 1960. In 1964, he founded Britain's first department of computer science and became its professor. The department, which had an initial complement of 12 academic staff, has grown five-fold and remains at the forefront of the subject. Kilburn held almost 100 patents and received degrees, awards and honours from all over the world, including being elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1965 and appointed CBE in 1973.</p> <p>He married Irene Marsden, also from Dewsbury, in August 1943. When seconded from TRE to Manchester in 1946, he initially commuted by train each day from Dewsbury, using the time to work on design problems - including deciding on the instruction set that the Baby would use, and writing the code of the first program.</p> <p>He retired in 1981 but, in 1998, was persuaded to play a major role in the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the birth of the Baby, including advising the Computer Conservation Society on the rebuilding of a working replica, now in the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry.</p> <p>Kilburn was a quiet, unpretentious person, who found pleasure in music and, above all, in football. He was an avid Manchester United fan and, until his wife died in 1981, attended matches regularly. He described the day in 1968 when he watched them win the European Cup as one of the best of his life. His absolute delight at the club's triple success in 1999 was a pleasure to see.</p> <p>He is survived by a son and a daughter.</p> <p>\u0095 Tom Kilburn, computer scientist, born August 11 1921; died January 17 2001.</p>",

In 1953, the world's first transistorised computer was commercialised as the Metro Vickers MV950. In 1954, MEG, probably the world's first computer to support floating-point arithmetic, was called Mercury when Ferranti marketed it. Atlas (1962) was the world's most powerful machine of its time. Finally, MU5 (1972) introduced new concepts that were adopted as the basis for the advanced 2900 computer series developed by ICL. The Atlas exemplifies how developments carried out by Kilburn and his team introduced key new concepts into computing. In this case, innovations included virtual memory, multi-programming, advanced operating systems, read-only memory and the compiler-compiler. Kilburn was appointed professor of computer engineering in 1960. In 1964, he founded Britain's first department of computer science and became its professor. The department, which had an initial complement of 12 academic staff, has grown five-fold and remains at the forefront of the subject. Kilburn held almost 100 patents and received degrees, awards and honours from all over the world, including being elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1965 and appointed CBE in 1973. He married Irene Marsden, also from Dewsbury, in August 1943. When seconded from TRE to Manchester in 1946, he initially commuted by train each day from Dewsbury, using the time to work on design problems - including deciding on the instruction set that the Baby would use, and writing the code of the first program. He retired in 1981 but, in 1998, was persuaded to play a major role in the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the birth of the Baby, including advising the Computer Conservation Society on the rebuilding of a working replica, now in the Manchester Museum of Science and Industry. Kilburn was a quiet, unpretentious person, who found pleasure in music and, above all, in football. He was an avid Manchester United fan and, until his wife died in 1981, attended matches regularly. He described the day in 1968 when he watched them win the European Cup as one of the best of his life. His absolute delight at the club's triple success in 1999 was a pleasure to see. He is survived by a son and a daughter. \u0095 Tom Kilburn, computer scientist, born August 11 1921; died January 17 2001.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is 15 years since the space shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after lifting off from Cape Canaveral, but the signature it left in the Florida skies remains vivid in the mind. It looked like a body writhing in agony. Out of a trunk of white cloud came two unfettered rockets, dementedly skywriting, like a pair of thrashing limbs attached to a decapitated torso. At the same time hundreds of burning fragments started to cascade to the ocean leaving their own smoky entrails. </p> <p>Rob Navias, a veteran radio reporter was speaking the words most people felt: \"Can it ... Can it? Oh my God, can Challenger have exploded? Oh no!\" \"What on Earth has happened?\" he added, intending no irony. </p> <p>In stark terms the fireball in the sky was the result of half a million gallons of liquid fuel vapourising, but neither the Nasa man nor Navias knew for sure what had happened. </p> <p>No one knew for sure. But there were two men watching on a TV screen far away in Utah who had a pretty good idea. One was Roger Boisjoly, a senior engineer at Morton-Thiokol, the contractors that built the solid rocket boosters for the space shuttle. The other was his manager, Bob Ebeling. </p> <p>A few minutes before the launch Boisjoly had been walking past Thiokol's conference room. Ebeling came rushing out and \"grabbed my arm and asked me to come in and watch the launch. At first I told Bob, 'no, I don't want to see the launch'. I knew what was about to happen and I just did not want to see the failure\". </p> <p>The previous evening Boisjoly and Ebeling had spent six hours in teleconference with Nasa managers arguing that the Challenger launch should be delayed. The two men had been told that the temperature in Florida was plummeting to below freezing and had been instantly concerned about whether their rockets would perform properly in such conditions. </p> <p>They appeared to be winning the argument - until their own managers turned against them and gave Nasa the recommendation they appeared to want: to launch. </p> <p>Boisjoly was persuaded by Ebeling to watch the TV that fateful morning of January 28 1986. He sat on the floor in front of the screen resting his back against the legs of the older man. When the clock reached T minus five seconds the two engineers held hands and braced themselves for an explosion. But to their immense relief Challenger cleared the launch pad. \"I turned to Bob and said 'we've just dodged a bullet,' because it was our expectation it would blow up on the pad.\" </p> <p>The two men began to relax. But then, at 73 seconds, the heart-stopping plume of white smoke suddenly filled the screen. \"There was silence for the longest time,\" says Boisjoly. \"Then I went to my office, sat facing the wall and tried to hold back my emotions.\" </p> <p>Boisjoly is telling me this outside Thiokol's test plant beneath the Wasatch mountains in northern Utah. He hasn't been here since leaving the company in July 1986, soon after testifying before the presidential commission into the Challenger disaster. His testimony, much praised by the commissioners, was heavily critical of his managers, and Boisjoly acquired a reputation as a whistleblower. </p> <p>The company blamed him for releasing documents to the commission which they had not asked for and had no idea existed; his community, for whom he'd once been mayor, blamed him for putting precious jobs in jeopardy. </p> <p>We're not welcome to go into the plant, but we can walk around the rocket park. It's a fantastic sight. The place bristles with 20 or so rocket motors, including half-remembered names such as the Minuteman, the Peacekeeper, and a Poseidon. The scene-stealer, though, is a decommissioned solid rocket booster hoisted on metal stanchions, 126ft long and dwarfing everything else. </p> <p>These provide nearly 75% of the thrust to get the shuttle into orbit and clearly, despite the disaster, they are still Thiokol's pride and joy. To commemorate his return, Boisjoly adds an entry to the apparently endless \"cools\" and \"far outs\" in the visitors' book. \"Roger Boisjoly\", it reads, \"I worked here and tried to stop the launch of Challenger.\" </p> <p>Each booster gets filled with millions of pounds of solid propellant and sent down to Cape Canaveral. No railway can transport an object 126ft long - at least none with a bend in. Thiokol had to build the rockets in sections and ship them to Florida, where they were reassembled on site. </p> <p>Boisjoly explains what happens when the boosters are ignited. \"The steel rim might look tough, but on ignition each section like this reacts to the intense pressure by blowing up like a balloon. When that happens something has to take up the slack where the joints are, to stop hot gas pouring out of the rocket.\" </p> <p>That job was given to two quarter-inch rubber seals called O-rings which had to expand with the metal and seal the gaps. If they failed to keep contact with the metal parts for more than a fifth of a second there would be a leakage. \"When solid rocket boosters leak,\" concludes Boisjoly, \"they explode.\" </p> <p>\"On the day Challenger launched it was very cold,\" he says, \"and when the temperatures dropped these rubber O-rings became harder and less pliable. Hard O-rings move slower and they seal less effectively. There might only be fraction of a second's difference but that is enough to separate success from total disaster.\" </p> <p>The tragedy of Challenger is that Boisjoly had been airing doubts about the O-rings for at least six months before the disaster. A year earlier he'd gone to Florida to inspect the spent rockets from a previous mission. He had been amazed at the condition of the joints. The primary seal had failed and allowed hot gas to surge by. </p> <p>Fortunately the secondary O-ring had trapped the gas. He shows me a photograph he took of the burned joint. All around the seals the normally honey-coloured grease has turned jet black, and parts of the primary O-ring are missing - clear signs that the joint has been scorched. \"When I saw that, I almost had a cardiac arrest,\" says Boisjoly. \"I could not believe that we had not blown the shuttle up.\" </p> <p>Nasa put the O-rings on the critical list. Thiokol created a task-force to look into the problem, but a shortage of equipment and personnel meant little was accomplished. Boisjoly, a task-force member, sent a memo to Thiokol's vice-president, pleading for a greater sense of urgency in testing the O-rings. \"It is my honest and very real fear,\" he wrote, \"that if we do not take immediate action ... we stand in jeopardy of losing a flight, along with all the launch pad facilities. The result would be a catastrophe of the highest order - loss of human life.\" </p> <p>That was July 31 1985. On the same day, on the Johnny Carson show, America was being introduced to the most recent recruit to the astronaut elite. Her name was Christa McAuliffe. She wasn't an astronaut really. She was a schoolteacher who had beaten off 11,000 other teachers to win a place on a forthcoming shuttle mission. </p> <p>Alongside Carson she was impressively unflappable, as if to \"the right stuff\" born, but she also showed a very un-astronaut ability to see the funny side to what she was about to do. She laughed when her host said that as a kid there were several teachers he would have just lo-o-o-o-ved to have sent into space. </p> <p>I went to see Christa's mother, Grace Corrigan, who lives in Framingham, Massachusetts. Her husband, Ed, died 10 years ago, retaining a deep anger at Nasa to the end of his life. Grace is a smart, good-looking woman with eyes that dance when she speaks. She has a huge oil painting of Christa in her blue astronaut suit, cradling in her arms a model of Challenger. \"Everybody was on a high,\" she says recalling the moment Christa was first chosen to become the teacher-in-space. \"It was just one of those nice things that happens to nice people. And everywhere she went they just rolled out the red carpet for her. She didn't come on strongly or anything. People just accepted her\". </p> <p>Challenger was meant to launch on January 25, but was twice postponed because of adverse weather reports. Then it was put back yet again, farcically this time. The astronauts were strapped into their seats and preparing for the final countdown when the close-out crew found they couldn't take the handle off the door because one of the screws had a broken thread. </p> <p>A drill was found but a succession of batteries were flat. Finally, after five hours, a hacksaw was used to sever the bolt and the door was closed. But crosswinds had built to unacceptable levels. The launch was scrubbed again. </p> <p>Grace followed some of this from her place in the grandstands. The irritation, and the sense that it still might be otherwise, remains strong today. \"I mean, after all, this is Nasa, right? They can do all these great things. They can launch, they can put a ship up in orbit. And they can't fix a screw on a handle!\" </p> <p>That afternoon the temperature at the Cape began to plummet. The launch team needed specialist advice. At around 6pm the call was made to Utah to ask whether Morton-Thiokol had any concerns about launching their rockets at a predicted -5C (23F). When the answer was \"yes\" another call was put in, this time to Nasa's rocket specialists at the Marshall space flight centre in Huntsville, Alabama. </p> <p>Judson Lovingood at the shuttle projects office received the call, and set about contacting his own engineers. I arranged to meet him in the room that he'd been in that night when the teleconference finally got under way. On the wall are the shields of all the shuttle missions Nasa has flown, including the Challenger flight of January 1986: the only one without a date of re-entry. </p> <p>He describes in unnerving detail who was there and where everyone sat and his eyes begin to fill - which is ironic, since he's been relating how he was a product of the very special, unsentimental, culture which prevailed here. If an engineer began a sentence starting with \"I know\" he was listened to with respect. If he began with an \"I think\", he never got to complete the first sentence. \"You don't do engineering by emotion,\" Lovingood explains. \"You can't get up and say, 'Hey, I've got a gut feeling this thing's gonna blow up.' They'll take you to the funny farm.\" </p> <p>That night the men at Marshall did listen to Boisjoly and his colleagues from Morton-Thiokol as they explained why the launch shouldn't go ahead in the morning. But they felt that what they were hearing were gut reactions, not engineering rationales. There was data, plenty of it, but it wasn't decisive, says Lovingood. </p> <p>Thiokol's bottom line was that it didn't want to fly outside its data base - which meant not launching below 12C (53F), the coldest launch temperature to date, and the temperature responsible, according to Boisjoly, for the damaged joints he had inspected a year before. After nearly five hours a curious impasse had been reached, with Nasa saying it wouldn't launch against a contractor's recommendation, but that the recommendation was baseless. </p> <p>It was at this point that a Thiokol vice-president asked to go off-line for five minutes. Boisjoly says that \"as soon as the button was pressed on the teleconference to sever us and mute us from Nasa, our general manager Jerry Mason, said in a soft voice that we had to make a 'management decision'. My whole being just started to rev up real bad because it was obvious that they were going to change from a 'no launch' to a 'go for launch' decision to accommodate their major customers\". </p> <p>It took 30 minutes, not five, but that is what happened. The engineers, including Boisjoly, were disenfranchised and the four senior managers voted to launch. Boisjoly stood up, grabbed the photograph of the burned O-rings, and planted it on the table in front of the four men. They refused to look at the photo. His boss released the mute button and told Nasa that Thiokol had changed its mind. They were for launch. </p> <p>Nasa had spent half the evening interrogating Thiokol over its initial recommendation. But this one provoked absolutely no debate. \"That was a mistake,\" says Lovingood. \"We should have asked them why they'd changed their minds.\" Instead Thiokol was simply asked to put its altered position into writing. It took a while to fax the new recommendation through to the Cape, but by midnight Nasa had the \"go\" it needed to launch Challenger in the morning. </p> <p> Challenger of course didn't blow up once. It kept blowing up - all day long, all week long even. In a state of shock, Americans wanted to see it again and again, as if the networks' looped tapes could somehow unravel their own anxiety. Eventually the TV stations replaced the image of the stricken craft with more \"positive\" shots of the astronauts eating breakfast together on the morning of the launch, but as intelligence grew about what had gone wrong - and the sheer avoidability of it - these pictures became in turn like watching a condemned man eating a last meal. </p> <p>Grace Corrigan accepts risk is an inherent part of spaceflight. It is hubris - and its strange bedfellow, complacency - she warns against. \"We'd put Nasa on a pedestal,\" she says. \"We were all children of the first space age and we thought they could do no wrong. Since then we've been forced to grow up.\" </p> <p>Boisjoly's disillusionment is greater. Corporate America dislikes a whistleblower and he has struggled to find work as an engineer since he walked away from Thiokol. For several years he was a wreck. \"I beat myself up for a long time over what happened on that night. Maybe I hadn't done enough. Maybe I should have gone home and called the New York Times or something. \"Well, I don't beat myself up any more. If I couldn't convince the guys on the inside who know all the technical data, how would I have convinced total strangers? They would have called Nasa and the PR people would have said, 'oh come on fellas, there hasn't been a launch since the start of space flight where some engineer hasn't tried to throw a switch and stop it'.\" </p> <p>If there is consolation for Boisjoly it is that since 1986, greater powers have been given to engineers working in, and for, Nasa to express dissent and call off flights. Too late to save him, and too late to save Challenger, but a victory of sorts. </p> <p>\u0095 Mark Hayhurst is the producer of Challenger: Go for Launch, showing at 9pm tonight on BBC2.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is 15 years since the space shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after lifting off from Cape Canaveral, but the signature it left in the Florida skies remains vivid in the mind. It looked like a body writhing in agony. Out of a trunk of white cloud came two unfettered rockets, dementedly skywriting, like a pair of thrashing limbs attached to a decapitated torso. At the same time hundreds of burning fragments started to cascade to the ocean leaving their own smoky entrails. Rob Navias, a veteran radio reporter was speaking the words most people felt: \"Can it ... Can it? Oh my God, can Challenger have exploded? Oh no!\" \"What on Earth has happened?\" he added, intending no irony. In stark terms the fireball in the sky was the result of half a million gallons of liquid fuel vapourising, but neither the Nasa man nor Navias knew for sure what had happened. No one knew for sure. But there were two men watching on a TV screen far away in Utah who had a pretty good idea. One was Roger Boisjoly, a senior engineer at Morton-Thiokol, the contractors that built the solid rocket boosters for the space shuttle. The other was his manager, Bob Ebeling. A few minutes before the launch Boisjoly had been walking past Thiokol's conference room. Ebeling came rushing out and \"grabbed my arm and asked me to come in and watch the launch. At first I told Bob, 'no, I don't want to see the launch'. I knew what was about to happen and I just did not want to see the failure\". The previous evening Boisjoly and Ebeling had spent six hours in teleconference with Nasa managers arguing that the Challenger launch should be delayed. The two men had been told that the temperature in Florida was plummeting to below freezing and had been instantly concerned about whether their rockets would perform properly in such conditions. They appeared to be winning the argument - until their own managers turned against them and gave Nasa the recommendation they appeared to want: to launch. Boisjoly was persuaded by Ebeling to watch the TV that fateful morning of January 28 1986. He sat on the floor in front of the screen resting his back against the legs of the older man. When the clock reached T minus five seconds the two engineers held hands and braced themselves for an explosion. But to their immense relief Challenger cleared the launch pad. \"I turned to Bob and said 'we've just dodged a bullet,' because it was our expectation it would blow up on the pad.\" The two men began to relax. But then, at 73 seconds, the heart-stopping plume of white smoke suddenly filled the screen. \"There was silence for the longest time,\" says Boisjoly. \"Then I went to my office, sat facing the wall and tried to hold back my emotions.\" Boisjoly is telling me this outside Thiokol's test plant beneath the Wasatch mountains in northern Utah. He hasn't been here since leaving the company in July 1986, soon after testifying before the presidential commission into the Challenger disaster. His testimony, much praised by the commissioners, was heavily critical of his managers, and Boisjoly acquired a reputation as a whistleblower. The company blamed him for releasing documents to the commission which they had not asked for and had no idea existed; his community, for whom he'd once been mayor, blamed him for putting precious jobs in jeopardy. We're not welcome to go into the plant, but we can walk around the rocket park. It's a fantastic sight. The place bristles with 20 or so rocket motors, including half-remembered names such as the Minuteman, the Peacekeeper, and a Poseidon. The scene-stealer, though, is a decommissioned solid rocket booster hoisted on metal stanchions, 126ft long and dwarfing everything else. These provide nearly 75% of the thrust to get the shuttle into orbit and clearly, despite the disaster, they are still Thiokol's pride and joy. To commemorate his return, Boisjoly adds an entry to the apparently endless \"cools\" and \"far outs\" in the visitors' book. \"Roger Boisjoly\", it reads, \"I worked here and tried to stop the launch of Challenger.\" Each booster gets filled with millions of pounds of solid propellant and sent down to Cape Canaveral. No railway can transport an object 126ft long - at least none with a bend in. Thiokol had to build the rockets in sections and ship them to Florida, where they were reassembled on site. Boisjoly explains what happens when the boosters are ignited. \"The steel rim might look tough, but on ignition each section like this reacts to the intense pressure by blowing up like a balloon. When that happens something has to take up the slack where the joints are, to stop hot gas pouring out of the rocket.\" That job was given to two quarter-inch rubber seals called O-rings which had to expand with the metal and seal the gaps. If they failed to keep contact with the metal parts for more than a fifth of a second there would be a leakage. \"When solid rocket boosters leak,\" concludes Boisjoly, \"they explode.\" \"On the day Challenger launched it was very cold,\" he says, \"and when the temperatures dropped these rubber O-rings became harder and less pliable. Hard O-rings move slower and they seal less effectively. There might only be fraction of a second's difference but that is enough to separate success from total disaster.\" The tragedy of Challenger is that Boisjoly had been airing doubts about the O-rings for at least six months before the disaster. A year earlier he'd gone to Florida to inspect the spent rockets from a previous mission. He had been amazed at the condition of the joints. The primary seal had failed and allowed hot gas to surge by. Fortunately the secondary O-ring had trapped the gas. He shows me a photograph he took of the burned joint. All around the seals the normally honey-coloured grease has turned jet black, and parts of the primary O-ring are missing - clear signs that the joint has been scorched. \"When I saw that, I almost had a cardiac arrest,\" says Boisjoly. \"I could not believe that we had not blown the shuttle up.\" Nasa put the O-rings on the critical list. Thiokol created a task-force to look into the problem, but a shortage of equipment and personnel meant little was accomplished. Boisjoly, a task-force member, sent a memo to Thiokol's vice-president, pleading for a greater sense of urgency in testing the O-rings. \"It is my honest and very real fear,\" he wrote, \"that if we do not take immediate action ... we stand in jeopardy of losing a flight, along with all the launch pad facilities. The result would be a catastrophe of the highest order - loss of human life.\" That was July 31 1985. On the same day, on the Johnny Carson show, America was being introduced to the most recent recruit to the astronaut elite. Her name was Christa McAuliffe. She wasn't an astronaut really. She was a schoolteacher who had beaten off 11,000 other teachers to win a place on a forthcoming shuttle mission. Alongside Carson she was impressively unflappable, as if to \"the right stuff\" born, but she also showed a very un-astronaut ability to see the funny side to what she was about to do. She laughed when her host said that as a kid there were several teachers he would have just lo-o-o-o-ved to have sent into space. I went to see Christa's mother, Grace Corrigan, who lives in Framingham, Massachusetts. Her husband, Ed, died 10 years ago, retaining a deep anger at Nasa to the end of his life. Grace is a smart, good-looking woman with eyes that dance when she speaks. She has a huge oil painting of Christa in her blue astronaut suit, cradling in her arms a model of Challenger. \"Everybody was on a high,\" she says recalling the moment Christa was first chosen to become the teacher-in-space. \"It was just one of those nice things that happens to nice people. And everywhere she went they just rolled out the red carpet for her. She didn't come on strongly or anything. People just accepted her\". Challenger was meant to launch on January 25, but was twice postponed because of adverse weather reports. Then it was put back yet again, farcically this time. The astronauts were strapped into their seats and preparing for the final countdown when the close-out crew found they couldn't take the handle off the door because one of the screws had a broken thread. A drill was found but a succession of batteries were flat. Finally, after five hours, a hacksaw was used to sever the bolt and the door was closed. But crosswinds had built to unacceptable levels. The launch was scrubbed again. Grace followed some of this from her place in the grandstands. The irritation, and the sense that it still might be otherwise, remains strong today. \"I mean, after all, this is Nasa, right? They can do all these great things. They can launch, they can put a ship up in orbit. And they can't fix a screw on a handle!\" That afternoon the temperature at the Cape began to plummet. The launch team needed specialist advice. At around 6pm the call was made to Utah to ask whether Morton-Thiokol had any concerns about launching their rockets at a predicted -5C (23F). When the answer was \"yes\" another call was put in, this time to Nasa's rocket specialists at the Marshall space flight centre in Huntsville, Alabama. Judson Lovingood at the shuttle projects office received the call, and set about contacting his own engineers. I arranged to meet him in the room that he'd been in that night when the teleconference finally got under way. On the wall are the shields of all the shuttle missions Nasa has flown, including the Challenger flight of January 1986: the only one without a date of re-entry. He describes in unnerving detail who was there and where everyone sat and his eyes begin to fill - which is ironic, since he's been relating how he was a product of the very special, unsentimental, culture which prevailed here. If an engineer began a sentence starting with \"I know\" he was listened to with respect. If he began with an \"I think\", he never got to complete the first sentence. \"You don't do engineering by emotion,\" Lovingood explains. \"You can't get up and say, 'Hey, I've got a gut feeling this thing's gonna blow up.' They'll take you to the funny farm.\" That night the men at Marshall did listen to Boisjoly and his colleagues from Morton-Thiokol as they explained why the launch shouldn't go ahead in the morning. But they felt that what they were hearing were gut reactions, not engineering rationales. There was data, plenty of it, but it wasn't decisive, says Lovingood. Thiokol's bottom line was that it didn't want to fly outside its data base - which meant not launching below 12C (53F), the coldest launch temperature to date, and the temperature responsible, according to Boisjoly, for the damaged joints he had inspected a year before. After nearly five hours a curious impasse had been reached, with Nasa saying it wouldn't launch against a contractor's recommendation, but that the recommendation was baseless. It was at this point that a Thiokol vice-president asked to go off-line for five minutes. Boisjoly says that \"as soon as the button was pressed on the teleconference to sever us and mute us from Nasa, our general manager Jerry Mason, said in a soft voice that we had to make a 'management decision'. My whole being just started to rev up real bad because it was obvious that they were going to change from a 'no launch' to a 'go for launch' decision to accommodate their major customers\". It took 30 minutes, not five, but that is what happened. The engineers, including Boisjoly, were disenfranchised and the four senior managers voted to launch. Boisjoly stood up, grabbed the photograph of the burned O-rings, and planted it on the table in front of the four men. They refused to look at the photo. His boss released the mute button and told Nasa that Thiokol had changed its mind. They were for launch. Nasa had spent half the evening interrogating Thiokol over its initial recommendation. But this one provoked absolutely no debate. \"That was a mistake,\" says Lovingood. \"We should have asked them why they'd changed their minds.\" Instead Thiokol was simply asked to put its altered position into writing. It took a while to fax the new recommendation through to the Cape, but by midnight Nasa had the \"go\" it needed to launch Challenger in the morning. Challenger of course didn't blow up once. It kept blowing up - all day long, all week long even. In a state of shock, Americans wanted to see it again and again, as if the networks' looped tapes could somehow unravel their own anxiety. Eventually the TV stations replaced the image of the stricken craft with more \"positive\" shots of the astronauts eating breakfast together on the morning of the launch, but as intelligence grew about what had gone wrong - and the sheer avoidability of it - these pictures became in turn like watching a condemned man eating a last meal. Grace Corrigan accepts risk is an inherent part of spaceflight. It is hubris - and its strange bedfellow, complacency - she warns against. \"We'd put Nasa on a pedestal,\" she says. \"We were all children of the first space age and we thought they could do no wrong. Since then we've been forced to grow up.\" Boisjoly's disillusionment is greater. Corporate America dislikes a whistleblower and he has struggled to find work as an engineer since he walked away from Thiokol. For several years he was a wreck. \"I beat myself up for a long time over what happened on that night. Maybe I hadn't done enough. Maybe I should have gone home and called the New York Times or something. \"Well, I don't beat myself up any more. If I couldn't convince the guys on the inside who know all the technical data, how would I have convinced total strangers? They would have called Nasa and the PR people would have said, 'oh come on fellas, there hasn't been a launch since the start of space flight where some engineer hasn't tried to throw a switch and stop it'.\" If there is consolation for Boisjoly it is that since 1986, greater powers have been given to engineers working in, and for, Nasa to express dissent and call off flights. Too late to save him, and too late to save Challenger, but a victory of sorts. \u0095 Mark Hayhurst is the producer of Challenger: Go for Launch, showing at 9pm tonight on BBC2.",

Lack of investment means, ironically, that there is still plenty of money around with nowhere to go. \"Wireless\" is the new buzzword and one of the few areas of activity still attracting substantial new money (although no one has yet worked out how to make a profit out of it). The internet revolution isn't over. It has hardly begun. There will be whole new debates this year about how wireless technologies - such as the short-range Bluetooth now starting to be unveiled - will change the world. Even though the debates may not take place in the same way at First Tuesday, historians will look at kindly on it as the place that acted as a catalyst to unleash a surge of entrepreneurial activity that a lot of people didn't realise existed.",

      "bodyText": "President George Bush placed the emotive issue of abortion rights at the centre of his fledgling presidency yesterday in moves that delighted Republican conservatives while laying the ground for political battles in the months to come. On his first full working day, he announced that he has decided to reimpose a ban on US government aid to international groups that promote or offer abortion or abortion counselling. The ban was introduced by Ronald Reagan during a speech in Mexico City in 1984 and became known as the \"Mexico City policy\". It was maintained by Mr Bush's father during his subsequent presidency, but reversed when Bill Clinton came into office. \"The president does not support using taxpayers' funds to provide abortions,\" the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, said. The news delighted anti-abortion campaigners. \"The US government will no longer be using taxpayer dollars to try to legalise abortion in countries in Latin America, Africa and Muslim countries,\" said Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee. The president's move came as supporters and opponents of abortion rights held rallies in Washington to mark the anniversary of the US supreme court ruling in the 1972 Roe v Wade case, which legalised the termination of a foetus during the first six months of pregnancy. \"The promises of our declaration of independence are not just for the strong, the independent or the healthy. They are for everyone, including unborn children,\" Mr Bush said in a statement read by a Republican congressman, Chris Smith. \"We share a great goal to work towards a day when every child is welcomed in life and protected by law, to build a culture of life, affirming that every person at every stage and season of life is created equal in God's image,\" he said. The two sides have held their rallies each year since the ruling, but the arrival of an opponent of abortion in the White House created fresh energy in both camps yesterday. \"We expect we'll make great strides in the next few years, now we have friends in the White House,\" Ann Scheidler of the Pro-Life Action League, said. \"Roe v Wade is more in danger today than at any time in the past 28 years,\" Gloria Feldt of the pro-choice Planned Parenthood organisation, warned. The principal goal of Republican conservatives is to reverse the 1972 supreme court ruling, and it is hoped that Mr Bush may soon get the chance to appoint a new member of the court when Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who supports abortion rights, retires, possibly in the summer. Politicians on both sides have said that they would make any new candidate's position on Roe v Wade a key issue in confirmation hearings for the new judge. The issue of overturning Roe v Wade appears to divide the Bush household itself. Last week, the president's wife Laura told NBC television that she did not think the ruling should be overturned. Asked about the disagreement yesterday, Mr Bush said: \"My wife is entitled to her opinion. Whether I do or don't agree with her is irrelevant.\" \u0095 Mr Bush will make his first foreign visit as US president to Mexico on February 16, the White House confirmed yesterday.",

      "body": "<p>When I arrived at work yesterday morning, I felt exhausted. My five-year-old son's body clock has gone awry. Ever since Christmas Day, he has been waking up at 4.30am, insisting that it's time to get up. He's right as rain - we're looking increasingly haggard. </p> <p>It's not just the sleep deprivation. It's simply the relentless pace at which a five-year-old boy lives. It's 7.15am and he wants you to play Thunderbirds while you cook his breakfast, prepare his packed lunch and hunt out his book bag. </p> <p>After school he wants to play football with you in the park; back home it's time for a quick session of pirates with a friend from school, then tea, then bath, then bed. It's action-packed, it's fantastic fun and it's physically gruelling - even if you're only in your mid-30s. </p> <p>Lynne Bezant is 56 and is expecting not one child, but twins. Yesterday she proudly displayed her bump on the front page of the Mirror newspaper, which celebrated this latest triumph of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) technology with a three-page world exclusive. </p> <p>Because, if all goes well, this summer Bezant will carry her two bundles of joy into the record books when she becomes Britain's oldest mother of twins. (Elizabeth Buttle became the oldest woman to give birth in Britain at the age of 60, in 1997.) </p> <p>At an age when most parents are either a) celebrating our children's independence or b) suffering pangs of empty nest syndrome, Bezant will be embarking on the wonderful journey of parenthood. Again. </p> <p>Lynne, you see, already has a grown-up family with her civil-servant husband Derek, her junior at 55. They have three children, who are now themselves at an age when many people start considering having a family of their own. Jenny, 32, Andrew, 30, and 26-year-old Chris have given their blessing to their parents' fourth stab at parenthood. At least the twins will be able to play with the grandchildren. </p> <p>In an editorial, which is worth reproducing in its entirety here, the Mirror eulogises older parenthood: \"Even if life doesn't really begin at 40, it certainly doesn't end at 50 nowadays. It isn't just that people live longer - they are fitter, healthier and more active than their parents were at that age,\" it says. \"So we should not be surprised that a couple in their 50s want to have more children. </p> <p>\"Some critics will say that Lynne and Derek Bezant should not be starting a new family at their age. Admittedly they will be well into their 70s by the time their twins finish school. But there are plenty of advantages to having children when you are older. </p> <p>\"Lynne and Derek have lots of experience of parenthood, for a start. They will be more relaxed than young parents and more able to deal with their youngsters' problems. In fact they will be better at bringing up their twins than many younger people. </p> <p>\"They love children. They know the hard work and problems involved. All the signs are that they will be perfect parents.\" </p> <p>The story of Bezant would be intriguing at any time, but it has particular resonance right now, coming so soon after a story of another couple desperate for children. Lynne and Derek Bezant paid \u00a35,000 for IVF treatment to give them the children they so wanted; Alan and Judith Kilshaw spent \u00a324,000 trying to get their adopted twins out of the US. </p> <p>Their stories are very different, but what has been striking in the case of the Kilshaws is the way in which the subsequent media storm has highlighted the needs and rights of children in the adoption process. For once, the focus is on them, rather than the needs and rights of their would-be parents. </p> <p>Most adopting parents know this already - the rigorous assessment, the gruelling matching process, the careful monitoring which follows a placement. The needs of the child are always paramount. It doesn't matter how much you want a child, how long you've been waiting, how many failed IVF cycles or mis carriages you have had. The child's welfare and needs come first. </p> <p>In IVF, however, the rights and needs of the parents seem the only consideration. If you can pay for it, you can usually get treatment. If they won't do it at one clinic because they feel you're too old, they'll suggest another that is more lenient. </p> <p>Bezant, who lives in Oxfordshire, became pregnant after three eggs from a donor woman were fertilised, two of which were successfully implanted into her womb. She underwent the treatment at the London Gynaecological clinic, which is widely considered to be one of the most \"liberal\" fertility centres in this country. </p> <p>Yesterday, Professor Ian Craft, director of the centre, was defending his decision to treat Bezant at a heated press conference at his plush Harley Street clinic. It was a happy ending to a tragic story, he insisted. The couple had always wanted a bigger family, but subsequent pregnancies had ended in miscarriage and, 20 years ago, still-born twins. </p> <p>Which is very sad. And the Bezants deserve our deepest sympathy. But whether that makes it right to give donor eggs, which are notoriously hard to come by in this country, to a 56-year-old woman who already has three children is another matter. The donor in this case apparently knew her eggs were going to a woman of 55 (Bezant was still 55 when she was treated), but might it not have made better sense if those eggs had gone to a younger woman who has not yet had the fortune to have and bring up her own child? </p> <p>Bezant might be the best mother in the world, but what about her two unborn children, what of their rights? Has their welfare been considered as the overwhelming priority? </p> <p>When they are five years old, waking at the crack of dawn, running round the park, running rings around their parents, their mother will be over 60. When they are 10 and still at primary school, she will be 65; when they are 20 and having the time of their lives at university perhaps, she will be 75. No matter how far we push the boundaries - life begins at 40, life begins at 50, Joan Collins in her bikini and Rosanna Della Corta, who was 63 when she gave birth to a baby boy in 1994 - 75 is old even by today's standards. </p> <p>The body charged with governing IVF, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), yesterday insisted that procedures were in place to ensure that the welfare of any child was considered before treatment went ahead. The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 provides that \"a woman shall not be provided with treatment services unless account has been taken of any child who may be born as a result of the treatment (including the need of that child for a father). And of any other child who may be affected by the birth\".</p> <p> The HFEA inspects clinics annually to ensure that the requirements of the act are being met. But its critics say it lacks teeth. James Yeandel, HFEA spokesman says fewer than 1 in 1,000 IVF patients is in their 50s. If sufficient concern is raised, the case of the Bezants may be considered at the next monthly HFEA meeting. </p> <p>Lord Winston, who runs a fertility clinic at the Hammersmith hospital, does not believe an age limit should be set. Each case has to be assessed on its merits and circumstance vary widely, but yesterday he was less than enthusiastic about Professor Craft's latest triumph. </p> <p>\"I can't comment on any individual case. On the face of it, it does not sound like a frightfully good decision. I don't think there would be many units where a woman like that would get treatment, but who knows? </p> <p>\"One would have to ask oneself whether that was not a misuse of a very valuable commodity (ie donated eggs). I'm jolly sure we would not have treated her at Hammersmith. We've always reserved donor eggs for women who have a premature menopause. </p> <p>\"People are waiting four or five years on a list for donor eggs. Very few women are prepared to donate eggs. Last year we treated about 10 couples using donor eggs. People who donate eggs on the whole imagine they are going to go to relatively young women.\" </p> <p>Peter Brinsden, medical director at Bourn Hall clinic, near Cambridge, said he would not have treated Bezant, but that did not mean it was unreasonable of Professor Craft to treat her. \"We have a policy that we do not treat women much over the age of about 59. I believe there are exceptional circumstances when it would be a reasonable thing to do. </p> <p>\"I would have said I know a man who might take a more liberal approach and I would send them to Ian Craft. I know he does not have the same rather conservative view that I have and is able and willing to take a rather more liberal view of a lot of these deserving cases. I respect that. </p> <p>\"It's something that's going to happen more and more often. Ian Craft has led the field in pushing the boundaries. Considering most women are now living to 85, these twins are going to be 30 when their mother dies. </p> <p>\"There's some evidence that having children increases longevity as well. I know there's a slight embarrassment at having a 65-year-old mother standing at the school gate when your are 10. But nowadays we have women of 35 or 40 picking up children at school when 10 years ago we never did.\" </p> <p> Liv O'Hanlon, director of the Adoption Forum, is unconvinced. \"This sort of thing makes me feel uncomfortable,\" she says. \"For me it's something to do with that straying over nature's line. Who wants to be brought up by their grandparents?\" </p> <p>She says the case was in stark contrast to the internet adoption uproar, where the needs of the children were rightly paramount. \"With IVF, I think the rights of a children are quite often ignored. They have to go through a short consultation but no more than that. They certainly don't have to go through 'are you a fit parent?' as you do in adoption. </p> <p>\"There's this sense that we should all be able to have what we want and we can't. I don't have a right to have children. All I have is a right to be fairly treated in my application. </p> <p>\"You have to question somebody's psyche that says at an age where she might naturally be a grandmother, that perhaps she would be better placed to take a more genteel route into grandparenthood, rather than put her body through this.\" </p> <p>Bezant may have the best motives in the world for adding to her family at this late stage; she may be a fit, healthy 56-year-old who will be around not only to see her twins through their childhood, but to see their children too. </p> <p>What this case has highlighted is the danger of using expensive interventionist technology to create children purely to satisfy the emotional needs of adults. Bezant told the Mirror: \"When the children left home we were lonely and longing for more family life. We loved having them around us.\" </p> <p>We use children to glue marriages together, to make us feel loved, to give us a purpose in life, to plug our emotional gaps. Whatever happened to their rights?</p>",

He plays a mild doctor whose blood rises when he's sentenced to slavery for treating a rebel leader: the injustice sets him on course as a buccaneer, clashing with Basil Rathbone, and finally winning Olivia de Havilland. In Dreams (Neil Jordan, 1998) 10pm, Sky Premier Jordan conjures nightmarish imagery reminiscent of his fable Company Of Wolves in this otherwise disappointing thriller about a serial killer lurking in New England. Robert Downey Jr is way over the top as the killer, and looks all the worse pitted against the excellent Annette Bening as the clairvoyant illustrator of children's books who develops a creepy psychological hotline into his disturbed mind. Naked Lunch (David Cronenberg, 1991) 1.40am Sky Cinema There's little of the late William Burroughs's junkie masterpiece here: \"It would be banned in every country in the world,\" Cronenberg said.

Wyclef is here to host an impressive line-up gathered to perform in aid of the Wyclef Jean Foundation: Eric Clapton, Whitney Houston, Mary J Blige, Third World, Charlotte Church, Macy Gray and Destiny's Child. </p> <p>Wyclef, who was only a moment ago the guy in The Fugees with Lauryn Hill is now a star in his own right - and his foundation provides deprived but musically talented kids with new instruments, free music lessons and general mentoring. </p> <p>The kids, here to take part in the show, seem to know Wyclef quite well. A Haitian immigrant made good from the Brooklyn ghetto, he was encouraged by a music teacher called Mrs Price. She's here, too, in blouson leather and fur trim, shepherding Clef's Kids, as they are called, and instructing them sternly to tidy away their empty soda cans. The green room walls are lined with Isaac Stern memorial posters. It is a historic occasion, as Wyclef later points out, for a brother to be bringing hip-hop to Carnegie Hall for the first time. And all in the name of charity. </p> <p>Coming from another dressing room is a noise that sounds like someone opening a lot of Christmas presents and having a lot of nice suprises. It's Charlotte Church warming her voice up. Charlotte Church and Wyclef Jean - an unlikely combo. She, achingly square with her glossy teenage fringe, pulling \"Ohmigod!\" faces when Eric Clapton congratulates her on her voice, and he the hip-hop master of cool. </p> <p>But Wyclef doesn't call himself The Ecleftic for nothing. He can appreciate an Ave Maria along with the best of them and, aged only 14, Church symbolises the young talent the evening is all about encouraging. </p> <p>At 8pm Clef's Kids are wheeled on to do their bit. The whole thing has the air of an end of term concert and the atmosphere is not helped at all by an auditorium so overlit that, later, Whitney interrupts her set to tell a record executive she recognises in the second row that she'll call him tomorrow. </p> <p>Ten minutes later Stevie Wonder himself appears on stage with reggae royals Third World who are giving proceedings a much needed bit of oomph with their 20-year-old hit Now That We've Found Love. And that's just the beginning. </p> <p>Wyclef wheels them out one after the other, all of them honoured to do their bit for charity. Clapton is capable, Whitney thin as a rake, Macy Gray stumbles around in a blonde afro wig and has her second number cut. Destiny's Child flaunt their own version of Girl Power as they call on \"independent women\" in the audience to stand up and give themselves a cheer. </p> <p>And yet it's Wyclef who emerges as the force to be reckoned with. He sings like an angel. He raps in five languages. He steers his way through the show with the greatest of ease, flinging himself fearlessly across musical barriers, the daring young man on the flying trapeze. He brings the stiff Carnegie Hall crowd - \"the rich white people\"- to life. </p> <p>The show ends bang on 11. There are queues of stretch limos in the street and much scrapping among the minions for aftershow party tickets. Those with not much power lord it over those with none at all, but of course everyone gets in in the end. Gossip comes down the line that Wyclef has made up his falling out with Lauryn Hill.

      "body": "<p>A studio lot, somewhere in Southern California. A dapper young executive hurtles past in his Lexus convertible, blithely knocks over a sign marked Reserved Parking, and pulls up. Striding toward his office, mobile glued to his ear, he's interrupted by a wounded-looking chef named Manny Sanchez. </p> <p>And the reason Manny's looking wounded is the reserved space is his, a perk for being appointed Employee of the Month. Which, counters the exec, is just too bad. Because, while impressed that Sanchez has refrained from urinating in the salad, he, conversely, has made enough gilt-edged blockbusters to earn their mutual bosses a billion dollars - and is, as such, \"employee of the fucking century\". </p> <p>Meet Peter Dragon (as played by the ever-smirking Jay Mohr), big league movie producer and foul-mouthed protagonist of Action!, the scabrous Hollywood satire which belatedly debuts in Britain tonight. You will not like him. You should, however, catch him while you can, because - thanks to the show's abrupt cancellation in the States - he'll only be around for the duration of Action!'s first, and last, 13 episodes. </p> <p>Which is a shame. Occasionally undone by moments of broad farce, Action! may never quite become the delirious fusion of Larry Sanders and The Player its high concept promises: but it is the next best thing, a gleefully deadpan insight into Tinseltown at its most grotesque, underpinned by a knowing grasp of film business mores. </p> <p>Where else, for example, are you going to see Disney vice-presidents moonlighting as French maids, or a guest-starring Keanu Reeves being smilingly fondled at a glitzy premiere?

      "bodyText": "A studio lot, somewhere in Southern California. A dapper young executive hurtles past in his Lexus convertible, blithely knocks over a sign marked Reserved Parking, and pulls up. Striding toward his office, mobile glued to his ear, he's interrupted by a wounded-looking chef named Manny Sanchez. And the reason Manny's looking wounded is the reserved space is his, a perk for being appointed Employee of the Month. Which, counters the exec, is just too bad. Because, while impressed that Sanchez has refrained from urinating in the salad, he, conversely, has made enough gilt-edged blockbusters to earn their mutual bosses a billion dollars - and is, as such, \"employee of the fucking century\". Meet Peter Dragon (as played by the ever-smirking Jay Mohr), big league movie producer and foul-mouthed protagonist of Action!, the scabrous Hollywood satire which belatedly debuts in Britain tonight. You will not like him. You should, however, catch him while you can, because - thanks to the show's abrupt cancellation in the States - he'll only be around for the duration of Action!'s first, and last, 13 episodes. Which is a shame. Occasionally undone by moments of broad farce, Action! may never quite become the delirious fusion of Larry Sanders and The Player its high concept promises: but it is the next best thing, a gleefully deadpan insight into Tinseltown at its most grotesque, underpinned by a knowing grasp of film business mores. Where else, for example, are you going to see Disney vice-presidents moonlighting as French maids, or a guest-starring Keanu Reeves being smilingly fondled at a glitzy premiere? Co-produced by the infamously bad-tempered Joel Silver, ursine mastermind of everything from Die Hard to The Matrix, it's tempting to see the entire project as a fat, manicured middle finger from Silver to his legion critics, as his slimline alter-ego employs personal abuse and egregious profanity where other people use chitchat.

Certainly the setting was right; a tight-lipped, highly privileged enclave of white South Africans living by its own rules on the fringes of an African city. When the police discovered Maria Wolmarans - Ria to her friends - shot dead in the hallway of her home in Botswana nearly four years ago, they had not the faintest idea who committed the murder. For months, detectives in the capital Gaborone believed she was the victim of a botched burglary.</p> <p>The white community was silent. Where fingers were pointed at all, they were at the maid. But one of their number, Mariette Bosch, had unwittingly laid the ground for a date with the gallows even before she murdered her best friend so she could marry the woman's husband. And while there were not many in the white community who would have turned her in to the police, Bosch had not counted on the antagonism of a close female relative.</p> <p>Next week, the appeal court will rule whether the 50-year-old mother of three is to become the first woman to hang in Botswana in three decades, for a killing prosecutors characterised as embracing the four Ls of murder - love, loot, lust and loathing.</p> <p>Bosch and her first husband moved to Botswana nine years ago, attracted by its booming, diamond-driven economy and low crime rate. They settled in Phakalane, an area of the capital so popular with well-off white South Africans that it's known as \"Little Sandton\" after a plush Johannesburg suburb.</p> <p>Some of the women work but most live the life of the old South Africa, attended by maids and \"garden boys\". Their days are filled with bridge clubs and casinos, and weekends with their husbands at game lodges and golf courses. The second car in the garage is as often as not a BMW, but four-wheel drives are increasingly popular for exploring Botswana's stunning landscape.</p> <p>Bosch slotted in easily. She grew up the daughter of a wealthy liquor store owner and knew all about spending money in the sprawling shopping malls that are a second home to so many white South African women. Before long she was part of Botswana's high society and a regular attendant at the Dutch Reformed Church in Gaborone. Other members of the congregation would later pay her bail.</p> <p>The Boschs became friends with Maria and Tienie Wolmarans. The women took classes together in decorating porcelain dolls and made \"the most decadent cakes\". But within months of Mariette Bosch's husband being killed in a car crash in 1995, she had begun an affair with Tienie. The pair drove to a Johannesburg motel and had what was described in court as \"good sexual intercourse\".</p> <p>The Wolmarans' marriage was already under strain. They had separated in 1993 and got back together the following year, but the problems were not resolved.</p> <p>Tienie promised to divorce his wife, but Bosch grew impatient. In June 1996, she drove to Pietersburg in South Africa and borrowed a pistol from a friend. The next day, she smuggled the gun across the border into Botswana. That night, she drove two blocks to the Wolmarans' house, climbed a six-foot wall and walked in. She met her victim in the hall and fired twice, hitting Maria Wolmarans in the stomach and ribs. There were no witnesses.</p> <p>For three months, the Gaborone police did not identify a single suspect. They put the killing down to a failed burglary and forgot about it. Bosch must have thought she had committed the perfect crime - but she had made a series of crucial errors and failed to take into account the loathing of a close relative.</p> <p>Before the killing, Bosch had confessed her love for Tienie Wolmarans to her sister-in-law, Judith Bosch - a woman who made no secret of her deep dislike of Mariette. Why Bosch did that remains a mystery, but it was a decision that was to cost her dear.</p> <p>After the killing, and without much explanation, Bosch gave the gun to Judith's husband to look after. Three months later, she ordered a wedding dress from a designer in Pretoria. When Judith found out about the weapon and the dress, and recalled her sister-in-law's earlier revelation, she drew her own conclusion and took the gun to the police.</p> <p>Pulled in for questioning, Tienie Wolmarans blurted out to detectives: \"I pray the gun and cartridges don't match.\" They did. Undeterred by the fact that Bosch was charged with the murder of his first wife, he married her.</p> <p>In Lobatse prison, Bosch refused to eat the staple diet of tripe. She grew thin and drawn, but still managed to arrive in court each day with her blue eyeshadow carefully applied.</p> <p>The trial was at times bizarre. One of the main defence witnesses was a psychologist, Dr Louise Olivier, who turned up looking like Barbara Cartland, in pink suit and big hair, and was revealed to be the sex doctor for a popular magazine. \"Let's suppose you were my wife - ha, ha, ha - and I knew you were going around with some guy,\" the judge asked her. \"Then suppose I go to Pretoria to get a gun, come back and shoot you - wouldn't you call that premeditation?\"</p> <p>Olivier had to confess she would. Her testimony ended with a loud bang from the witness box and a grovelling apology. The judge provoked much laughter when he replied: \"Don't be sorry. It's only the bible you dropped!\"</p> <p>Bosch's family were horrified at the circus atmosphere. Her 14-year-old daughter, Sune, wept in court.</p> <p>Yet even after her conviction, Bosch imagined she would walk free. \"I believe that God will deliver me from this nightmare,\" she said. \"I have been framed. People have turned against me, but God will not.\"</p> <p>As she awaited sentence, her neighbour, Stafanje Hugo, said: \"Poor thing. She's convinced they'll let her go. Tienie asked me to tell her everything would be OK, like she thinks. But I couldn't do that to my friend.\"</p> <p>The only visible reaction from Bosch as she was sentenced to hang was her fingernails digging into her arm. Her daughter Charmaine, 25, crouched on the floor and shook.</p> <p>There are those who believe Bosch should not face the hangman alone. In handing down his guilty verdict, the judge also implicated Wolmarans. \"I find that the accused and Tienie were seriously in love before the death of the deceased and that they wanted the deceased out of Tienie's way for them to get married,\" he said.</p> <p>The police investigated the possibility that Tienie Wolmarans had a hand in his wife's murder but he has never been charged. \"The police already arrested me on that suspicion, but I was released after one night because they had no evidence,\" he said.</p> <p>Last week, Bosch appealed. She was represented by a British barrister, Desmond da Silva, who has so far won reprieves from the executioner for 35 people. He worked to persuade judges from Britain and Africa - who sit as Botswana's appeal court under its post-colonial judicial system - that the state had wrongly failed to reveal to the defence that it had granted immunity from prosecution to a leading suspect in the murder in return for agreeing to testify against Bosch.</p> <p>If the conviction stands, the death penalty is mandatory for murder in Botswana unless there are extenuating circumstances. The judge who sentenced Bosch a year ago, Isaac Aboagye, said he could find none. \"The crime was carefully planned with the motive of enabling you to take over the husband of the deceased,\" he said. \"I have not been able to find one moral extenuating circumstance. You are not very young, you were not intoxicated and you were not provoked.\"</p> <p>If her appeal is refused next week, Bosch's only hope of avoiding the gallows is clemency. Of the 14 people sentenced to death in Botswana over the past decade, six have been hanged and six others have had their sentences commuted. The remaining two are Bosch and another South African, a man convicted of killing a policeman. <br><br>But the Botswana government might just want to make the point that citizens of its large neighbour to the south - white and black - cannot turn the quiet suburbs of Gaborone into the Johannesburg they moved to escape.</p>",

This morning, Sidelines has already used feminism to change the cat litter and later plans to use it to make a pencil case.</p> <p>So we were fascinated to learn that none other than former doyenne of all things hush-hush, Dame Stella Rimington, has been accused of using feminism to promote her memoirs. Downing Street is apparently furious that Rimington is justifying publishing the book by claiming that it will inspire other women. She has reportedly told colleagues: \"The book will show how a woman can succeed in a man's world.\"</p> <p>It is a curiously antiquated way to put it, particularly as it implies working to a set of binary assumptions about whose territory is whose, rather than acknowledging broader structural inequalities. But perhaps that binary is not as past tense as we'd thought, given the impending launch of a drive to put \"emotional literacy\" (ghastly phrase) at the heart of the political agenda. Tomorrow, Antidote, the \"Campaign for Emotional Literacy\", will set out its manifesto at the Houses of Parliament. Supporters include Patricia Hewitt, Helena Kennedy and Anthony Giddens, and the aim is to \"create an emotionally literate culture, where the facility to handle the complexities of emotional life is as widespread as the capacity to read, write and do arithmetic\".</p> <p>It's an exciting agenda - but Sidelines has a few concerns. \"Emotional literacy\" has previously been linked with that other great catch-all, \"the feminisation of the workplace\", and often becomes muddled with that unbecoming binary of \"lady's feelings good/man's feelings elsewhere\". Is it always good to talk? The fact that women are more comfortable in the emotional arena doesn't mean they always use that confidence appropriately. And an ability to juggle with the linguistics of therapy doesn't automatically connect us to what we describe.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the way we talk is actually separating us from our humanity. It is of course a truism that, as technology gives us more and more means of communication, we wind up further apart. Communication is increasingly the dissembler's art: call when voicemail's on, fire off a flirtatious email when you've never seen the recipient face to face. Increasingly, we communicate to check in rather than to chat. We tot up our contact points without taking responsibility for where that contact might lead. If this is emotional literacy, it is a truncated kind.</p> <p>Thank heavens the buffoon who is now leader of the free world successfully halted his daughter Jenna's frock flop at his inaugural doodad, though a flashed nip would momentarily have distracted us from miserable musings on batty foreign policy and abortion law repeal. Also, fact fans, were you aware that Dubya's twins, Barbara and Jenna, are named after their maternal and paternal grandmothers? Succession being what it is, our bets are on wee Jenna in the Whitehouse by 2016.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Have you used feminism today, dear readers? If not, don't fret: you have right up to the witching hour to employ it however you desire. This morning, Sidelines has already used feminism to change the cat litter and later plans to use it to make a pencil case. So we were fascinated to learn that none other than former doyenne of all things hush-hush, Dame Stella Rimington, has been accused of using feminism to promote her memoirs. Downing Street is apparently furious that Rimington is justifying publishing the book by claiming that it will inspire other women. She has reportedly told colleagues: \"The book will show how a woman can succeed in a man's world.\" It is a curiously antiquated way to put it, particularly as it implies working to a set of binary assumptions about whose territory is whose, rather than acknowledging broader structural inequalities. But perhaps that binary is not as past tense as we'd thought, given the impending launch of a drive to put \"emotional literacy\" (ghastly phrase) at the heart of the political agenda. Tomorrow, Antidote, the \"Campaign for Emotional Literacy\", will set out its manifesto at the Houses of Parliament. Supporters include Patricia Hewitt, Helena Kennedy and Anthony Giddens, and the aim is to \"create an emotionally literate culture, where the facility to handle the complexities of emotional life is as widespread as the capacity to read, write and do arithmetic\". It's an exciting agenda - but Sidelines has a few concerns. \"Emotional literacy\" has previously been linked with that other great catch-all, \"the feminisation of the workplace\", and often becomes muddled with that unbecoming binary of \"lady's feelings good/man's feelings elsewhere\". Is it always good to talk? The fact that women are more comfortable in the emotional arena doesn't mean they always use that confidence appropriately. And an ability to juggle with the linguistics of therapy doesn't automatically connect us to what we describe. Meanwhile, the way we talk is actually separating us from our humanity. It is of course a truism that, as technology gives us more and more means of communication, we wind up further apart. Communication is increasingly the dissembler's art: call when voicemail's on, fire off a flirtatious email when you've never seen the recipient face to face. Increasingly, we communicate to check in rather than to chat. We tot up our contact points without taking responsibility for where that contact might lead. If this is emotional literacy, it is a truncated kind. Thank heavens the buffoon who is now leader of the free world successfully halted his daughter Jenna's frock flop at his inaugural doodad, though a flashed nip would momentarily have distracted us from miserable musings on batty foreign policy and abortion law repeal. Also, fact fans, were you aware that Dubya's twins, Barbara and Jenna, are named after their maternal and paternal grandmothers? Succession being what it is, our bets are on wee Jenna in the Whitehouse by 2016.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A confidential prison service report following the murder of an Asian inmate by a white prisoner at Feltham, west London, has concluded that the youth jail is guilty of institutional racism, with ethnic minority staff and inmates enduring overt racist abuse by warders and failures by senior management. </p> <p>The report, obtained by the Guardian, follows the beating to death of Zahid Mubarek by his cellmate Robert Stewart and is the most damning official indictment of racism within a British jail ever. </p> <p>Martin Narey, director general of the prison service, commented: \"There's no element of denial, I've been absolutely up front about the problems we have. It goes beyond institutional racism to blatant malicious pockets of racism.\" </p> <p>But Mr Narey said no officer was facing disciplinary action over racism or allegations of intimidation because evidence had not been found identifying individuals as culpable. </p> <p>The prison service commissioned an internal inquiry into the troubled young offenders' institution in September. Stewart was convicted of Mubarek's racist murder in November. Prison staff missed repeated signs that Stewart, a racist psychopath, would harm his cellmate. </p> <p>The report by the senior investigating officer, Ted Butt, brands Feltham as \"institutionally racist\", and found a \"damning indictment of how staff are failing in their duty of care towards prisoners\". </p> <p>It concludes: \"There is evidence that racism exists at Feltham, both overtly and by more subtle methods. Minority ethnic staff should not have to tolerate the level of harassment that exists in order to feel accepted as part of the team. Similarly, prisoners should be able to live free from racist abuse by staff.\" </p> <p>The first part of Mr Butt's report on Feltham, revealed by the Guardian in November, condemned poor management and a host of other failings that led to Stewart's racist and violent tendencies being missed. </p> <p>The second part of the report focuses solely on racism. It has been with Mr Narey for weeks, having been completed in December - but no date for its publication has been set. </p> <p>Last night Mr Mubarek's family demanded that the government set up a full public inquiry into his death. Their lawyer, Imran Khan, said Mr Narey should call in the police: \"There's no doubt there's a degree of criminal culpability by prison officers who've abused their position.\" </p> <p>Mr Butt's report says: \"Evidence found by the team suggests that a small number of staff sustained and promoted overtly racist behaviour as well as more subtle methods and that there are issues surrounding both staff and prisoners. </p> <p>\"Staff from all ethnic groups told of an underlying culture that suggests the only way minority ethnic group staff can be accepted as part of the team of Feltham is by enduring racist comments and racist banter/jokes. Senior managers know what they should be doing but have not done it. This leads the inquiry team to form the conclusion that Feltham is institutionally racist.\" </p> <p>The report, stamped as confidential on each of its 30 pages, found a \"failure by staff at all levels to take complaints of racist incidents seriously\". It said some of those responsible for race training believed racist jokes could be acceptable. </p> <p>Half of Feltham's 717 inmates are from Asian or Afro-Caribbean backgrounds, as are 11% of its 654 staff. The senior management is entirely white. </p> <p>The inquiry team even doubted whether records detailing which staff had received race relations training were genuine. </p> <p>\"The training department records show that 103 members of staff have received race relations training since November 1999.

      "bodyText": "A confidential prison service report following the murder of an Asian inmate by a white prisoner at Feltham, west London, has concluded that the youth jail is guilty of institutional racism, with ethnic minority staff and inmates enduring overt racist abuse by warders and failures by senior management. The report, obtained by the Guardian, follows the beating to death of Zahid Mubarek by his cellmate Robert Stewart and is the most damning official indictment of racism within a British jail ever. Martin Narey, director general of the prison service, commented: \"There's no element of denial, I've been absolutely up front about the problems we have. It goes beyond institutional racism to blatant malicious pockets of racism.\" But Mr Narey said no officer was facing disciplinary action over racism or allegations of intimidation because evidence had not been found identifying individuals as culpable. The prison service commissioned an internal inquiry into the troubled young offenders' institution in September. Stewart was convicted of Mubarek's racist murder in November. Prison staff missed repeated signs that Stewart, a racist psychopath, would harm his cellmate. The report by the senior investigating officer, Ted Butt, brands Feltham as \"institutionally racist\", and found a \"damning indictment of how staff are failing in their duty of care towards prisoners\". It concludes: \"There is evidence that racism exists at Feltham, both overtly and by more subtle methods. Minority ethnic staff should not have to tolerate the level of harassment that exists in order to feel accepted as part of the team. Similarly, prisoners should be able to live free from racist abuse by staff.\" The first part of Mr Butt's report on Feltham, revealed by the Guardian in November, condemned poor management and a host of other failings that led to Stewart's racist and violent tendencies being missed. The second part of the report focuses solely on racism. It has been with Mr Narey for weeks, having been completed in December - but no date for its publication has been set. Last night Mr Mubarek's family demanded that the government set up a full public inquiry into his death. Their lawyer, Imran Khan, said Mr Narey should call in the police: \"There's no doubt there's a degree of criminal culpability by prison officers who've abused their position.\" Mr Butt's report says: \"Evidence found by the team suggests that a small number of staff sustained and promoted overtly racist behaviour as well as more subtle methods and that there are issues surrounding both staff and prisoners. \"Staff from all ethnic groups told of an underlying culture that suggests the only way minority ethnic group staff can be accepted as part of the team of Feltham is by enduring racist comments and racist banter/jokes. Senior managers know what they should be doing but have not done it. This leads the inquiry team to form the conclusion that Feltham is institutionally racist.\" The report, stamped as confidential on each of its 30 pages, found a \"failure by staff at all levels to take complaints of racist incidents seriously\". It said some of those responsible for race training believed racist jokes could be acceptable. Half of Feltham's 717 inmates are from Asian or Afro-Caribbean backgrounds, as are 11% of its 654 staff. The senior management is entirely white. The inquiry team even doubted whether records detailing which staff had received race relations training were genuine. \"The training department records show that 103 members of staff have received race relations training since November 1999. Sixteen members of staff surveyed are shown as having been trained, out of these only three stated they had been trained.\" The report says it is apparent that the poor state of race relations at Feltham owes much to the lack of an effective race relations management team. The inquiry team felt the team was reactive rather than proactive. The report says warders were twice as likely to use control and restraint force against black or Asian inmates than against a white prisoner. It also found that inmates had no faith in the complaints system and heard allegations from the board of visitors that prisoners were intimidated into keeping silent. Mr Butt calls for a further inquiry into a host of concerns and wrote: \"The use of unacceptable language, intimidating prisoners into not complaining, failures to carry out investigations of racist incidents and evident deficiencies in the regime concerning food, paint a sorry picture of Feltham prison. \"Most alarmingly, though, families contacting the board of visitors rather than the managers at Feltham to complain about racist issues, is a damning indictment of the lack of trust between prisoners, their families and Feltham prison.\" The report's conclusion says: \"The procedures in place for reporting and recording racist incidents are poor, inconsistent and not communicated to those who may need to use them. Similarly, the procedures for investigating such incidents are haphazard, incomplete and again inconsistently applied.\" It demands that improvements in race relations must be a management priority. The report also says that a staff member is under investigation after \"requesting a Muslim visitor to remove his headgear for searching\". Imtiaz Mubarek, uncle of Zahid, aged 19 when he was murdered in March 2000, said: \"This is more reason for there to be a full public inquiry into Zahid's death. Feltham is a hotbed for racism.

      "byline": "Adrian Searle",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The first work in the Royal Academy's exhibition The Genius of Rome 1592-1623 is a painting of a boy in an white shirt skinning a piece of fruit. As he focuses on his task we concentrate on him, as though across a table, where he pares the rind with his knife. It is a delicate, quiet painting, the boy brightly lit against darkness. A symbol, in this show at least, of a world about to be unpeeled. </p> <p>This painting, by Caravaggio, was completed in 1592, the year of his arrival in Rome at the age of 21. The date also provides the starting point for an exhibition which is much more than an art-historical stroll through the beginnings of the Baroque. Of the 143 paintings here - including works by Annibale Carracci, Domenichino, Van Dyck, Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi, Guercino, Reni, Rubens and host of others - 15 are by Caravaggio. Wherever one looks, there Caravaggio seems to be; and wherever he is, your eyes swerve to him. And his influence is everywhere. </p> <p>Yet Caravaggio, in the years following his sudden departure from Rome in 1606, after murdering a man over a wager, was dismissed as being only of interest to \"eccentrics, connoisseurs and foreign artists\". We cannot dismiss him now. He is too spectacular, too fierce, too extreme; still, at times, too shocking. </p> <p>On his arrival Rome was, in catalogue author Beverly Louise Brown's slightly unhappy turn of phrase, a \"Mecca\" for artists from throughout Italy and the rest of Europe. They didn't only come to study the antique, or the wonders of the High Renaissance. Rome was rich. The church, in its various guises, offered an enormous amount of patronage, as did secular Rome. The newly elected Pope Clement VIII may have been pious, but his \"papal nephews\" lived in high style. Street life was turbulent, colourful and violent. It was a city of hustlers, prostitutes, gypsies, card-sharps, gamblers, pickpockets and cut-purses. We may recognise this \"Paradise of Swindlers\", but we wouldn't want to live there. </p> <p>A boy studies his hand of cards, while we see the young card sharp fingering a concealed card from his waistband, ready to fleece the mark. The young men look similar. Perhaps they are the same boy, painted from the same model, caught in a circular, table-turning trick with time. Over the dupe's shoulder, an older accomplice signals to the grifter. </p> <p>Over 30 copies of Caravaggio's 1595 The Cardsharps are known to exist, as though to multiply the deception. Deceptions indeed proliferated - Simon Vouet's painting of a young woman who laughs and lets us in on the fact that she knows that while the fortune-teller is trying to work the ring from her finger, so a dip has his hand in the fortune-teller's bag. </p> <p>The popularity of such images may have partly been that they flattered the worldly sophistication of their audience, wise guys themselves who'd never fall for such a cheap trick. Yet surely there is a level at which such paintings also meditate on the trickery of art itself, and on the relationship between paintings and their viewers. </p> <p>These almost Dickensian - not to say Shakespearean - scoundrels of the tavern and the street, depicted as light fingered hustlers or exaggeratedly hammy types, are matched by the more complex psychology of the beautiful androgynous Spanish castrato in Caravaggio's Lute Player, his Boy with a Basket of Fruit, his Musicians tuning up, his pretty, fated boys. Valentin de Boulogne's court buffoon and self-proclaimed count Raffaello Menicucci is painted with a certain pathos, and sympathy for the buffoon's ridiculous aggrandisements. </p> <p>The alarming Hairy Harry, Mad Peter and Tiny Amon, the deformed bucolics who entertained for the Farnese household, and were a gift to Cardinal Odoardo Farnese from the Duke of Palma, are as fully human, joking and affectionate with a menagerie of pets, as they are themselves objects of our amusement. Agostino Carracci's painting of them - a sort of farcical naturalism derived from Caravaggio - is astonishing. </p> <p>One of the great twists in this show is to be able to move from a painting such as this to Annibale Carracci's self portrait, a head and shoulders painting-within-a-painting, the portrait resting on an easel in a darkened room, with a vague human presence in the doorway behind. </p> <p>What a curious image this is. A dog's eyes glint at the foot of the easel, a patch of white on the painter's palette catches the light. It is a small, haunting work by an artist apparently in the throes of a breakdown. This little work hits all the harder for its strangeness, its melancholy, its vacancy. There is a danger, in blockbuster shows like this, that lesser-known works will be passed-over or missed, in the rush, perhaps, to get to the gore, to Artemisia Gentileschi's Judith, Beheading Holofernes, with the blood all over the sheet, or to Caravaggio's earlier version of the same subject. Don't rush, wait. </p> <p>Caravaggio, holding aloft a lantern, portrayed himself on the extreme right of his nocturnal The Taking of Christ. How much intense light Caravaggio gives us. Christ is jostled, about to be taken by a man in black armour, whose reaching arm is dramatised by a great liquid smear of reflected moonlight. </p> <p>The light flattens as well as reveals, shadows engulf as much as the light illuminates. Caravaggio edits and crops with light and dark, working back into compositions whose figures were modelled from life. Part of his appeal, surely, is his almost cinematic focus, the spotlights which drag the eye over the engulfing dark, from figure to figure, face to face. This is where the drama is. </p> <p>No wonder he attracted so many followers in Rome; even in 1620, 10 years after his death, there were Flemish, French and Dutch Carravagists, reworking the same scenes, the same dramas. But really, there is no competition. </p> <p>One of the great things about the main galleries of the Royal Academy are the long sight-lines it affords, and Caravaggio's starkly-lit St John the Baptist (his second version of the subject), has the brooding, almost naked boy caught in stark moonlight. But the light is too intense for the moon: the coruscating wattage is too high. Was painting the only place where such contrast of light and dark could exist? </p> <p>At a distance - 10 yards, 20, 30 - the painting is still readable down the long narrow vista.

      "bodyText": "The first work in the Royal Academy's exhibition The Genius of Rome 1592-1623 is a painting of a boy in an white shirt skinning a piece of fruit. As he focuses on his task we concentrate on him, as though across a table, where he pares the rind with his knife. It is a delicate, quiet painting, the boy brightly lit against darkness. A symbol, in this show at least, of a world about to be unpeeled. This painting, by Caravaggio, was completed in 1592, the year of his arrival in Rome at the age of 21. The date also provides the starting point for an exhibition which is much more than an art-historical stroll through the beginnings of the Baroque. Of the 143 paintings here - including works by Annibale Carracci, Domenichino, Van Dyck, Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi, Guercino, Reni, Rubens and host of others - 15 are by Caravaggio. Wherever one looks, there Caravaggio seems to be; and wherever he is, your eyes swerve to him. And his influence is everywhere. Yet Caravaggio, in the years following his sudden departure from Rome in 1606, after murdering a man over a wager, was dismissed as being only of interest to \"eccentrics, connoisseurs and foreign artists\". We cannot dismiss him now. He is too spectacular, too fierce, too extreme; still, at times, too shocking. On his arrival Rome was, in catalogue author Beverly Louise Brown's slightly unhappy turn of phrase, a \"Mecca\" for artists from throughout Italy and the rest of Europe. They didn't only come to study the antique, or the wonders of the High Renaissance. Rome was rich. The church, in its various guises, offered an enormous amount of patronage, as did secular Rome. The newly elected Pope Clement VIII may have been pious, but his \"papal nephews\" lived in high style. Street life was turbulent, colourful and violent. It was a city of hustlers, prostitutes, gypsies, card-sharps, gamblers, pickpockets and cut-purses. We may recognise this \"Paradise of Swindlers\", but we wouldn't want to live there. A boy studies his hand of cards, while we see the young card sharp fingering a concealed card from his waistband, ready to fleece the mark. The young men look similar. Perhaps they are the same boy, painted from the same model, caught in a circular, table-turning trick with time. Over the dupe's shoulder, an older accomplice signals to the grifter. Over 30 copies of Caravaggio's 1595 The Cardsharps are known to exist, as though to multiply the deception. Deceptions indeed proliferated - Simon Vouet's painting of a young woman who laughs and lets us in on the fact that she knows that while the fortune-teller is trying to work the ring from her finger, so a dip has his hand in the fortune-teller's bag. The popularity of such images may have partly been that they flattered the worldly sophistication of their audience, wise guys themselves who'd never fall for such a cheap trick. Yet surely there is a level at which such paintings also meditate on the trickery of art itself, and on the relationship between paintings and their viewers. These almost Dickensian - not to say Shakespearean - scoundrels of the tavern and the street, depicted as light fingered hustlers or exaggeratedly hammy types, are matched by the more complex psychology of the beautiful androgynous Spanish castrato in Caravaggio's Lute Player, his Boy with a Basket of Fruit, his Musicians tuning up, his pretty, fated boys. Valentin de Boulogne's court buffoon and self-proclaimed count Raffaello Menicucci is painted with a certain pathos, and sympathy for the buffoon's ridiculous aggrandisements. The alarming Hairy Harry, Mad Peter and Tiny Amon, the deformed bucolics who entertained for the Farnese household, and were a gift to Cardinal Odoardo Farnese from the Duke of Palma, are as fully human, joking and affectionate with a menagerie of pets, as they are themselves objects of our amusement. Agostino Carracci's painting of them - a sort of farcical naturalism derived from Caravaggio - is astonishing. One of the great twists in this show is to be able to move from a painting such as this to Annibale Carracci's self portrait, a head and shoulders painting-within-a-painting, the portrait resting on an easel in a darkened room, with a vague human presence in the doorway behind. What a curious image this is. A dog's eyes glint at the foot of the easel, a patch of white on the painter's palette catches the light. It is a small, haunting work by an artist apparently in the throes of a breakdown. This little work hits all the harder for its strangeness, its melancholy, its vacancy. There is a danger, in blockbuster shows like this, that lesser-known works will be passed-over or missed, in the rush, perhaps, to get to the gore, to Artemisia Gentileschi's Judith, Beheading Holofernes, with the blood all over the sheet, or to Caravaggio's earlier version of the same subject. Don't rush, wait. Caravaggio, holding aloft a lantern, portrayed himself on the extreme right of his nocturnal The Taking of Christ. How much intense light Caravaggio gives us. Christ is jostled, about to be taken by a man in black armour, whose reaching arm is dramatised by a great liquid smear of reflected moonlight. The light flattens as well as reveals, shadows engulf as much as the light illuminates. Caravaggio edits and crops with light and dark, working back into compositions whose figures were modelled from life. Part of his appeal, surely, is his almost cinematic focus, the spotlights which drag the eye over the engulfing dark, from figure to figure, face to face. This is where the drama is. No wonder he attracted so many followers in Rome; even in 1620, 10 years after his death, there were Flemish, French and Dutch Carravagists, reworking the same scenes, the same dramas. But really, there is no competition. One of the great things about the main galleries of the Royal Academy are the long sight-lines it affords, and Caravaggio's starkly-lit St John the Baptist (his second version of the subject), has the brooding, almost naked boy caught in stark moonlight. But the light is too intense for the moon: the coruscating wattage is too high. Was painting the only place where such contrast of light and dark could exist? At a distance - 10 yards, 20, 30 - the painting is still readable down the long narrow vista. It has incredible visual punch. One almost begins to think of Caravaggio's most chiaroscuro works as screens, the images on them not so much painted as projected, or back-lit. St John the Baptist faces Annibale Carracci's Hercules at the Crossroads, framed through a succession of doorways. Caravaggio's greatest rival in Rome, Carracci's method could not be more different. Where Caravaggio seems to want to evince a palpable reality, Carracci's style is all quotation and classicising. Clearly, Hercules and the figures for Vice and Virtue have been patched into the scene, which is cluttered with details which one might even think are included as much to glue the space together as they are to compound the painting's classical allusions. It is exhausting to look at. It is no longer either fashionable nor wise to make the mistake of seeing any artist in isolation from the period or epoch that made them, their friendships and antagonisms, their patrons. This task, both the exhibition and the catalogue take on board. Caravaggio might tower over this exhibition, and make Annibale Carracci look insipid, but this is much to do with our taste, which we also cannot avoid. I can admire Rubens's St Gregory, almost levitating in his voluminous drapes, or Guercino's depiction of the same saint, who looks like a tortoise, his wrinkled neck and querulous head poking out from his embroidery and brocade, but they don't move me. Caravaggio's Entombment, in which Christ's limp body is lifted, almost presented to us in death, has a vividness, a pared-down gravity (the shroud falling away from the sagging body, the corner of the tomb jutting into the extreme foreground) that roots me to the spot. Compared to this, almost all else in the final room of the exhibition are just paintings. We cannot look at Caravaggio in our secular age without seeing him in the light of modern sexual mores, modern psychology, modern pathology. Caravaggio looks forward to our time, and we look back at his.

Which discipline do you prefer and which do you see yourself as?</strong><br></p> <p>I don't see myself as any one thing. Not just a poet or mainly a novelist or anything like that. I really like to try my hand at everything and I think it's probably dangerous to let oneself be pigeon-holed, not necessarily by other people but in one's own mind.

My main interest is contemporary American poets and some Spanish language poets and I keep in touch with their work through either their websites or email. Even workshop stuff - I've got a couple of friends in America who send me poems to discuss during the composition and I sometimes send poems to them and ask for advice or comments or questions. It's a feeling of response, a sounding board somewhere, to hear what they think of something. It's difficult to get a perspective on one's own work sometimes, a sense of distance, whereas someone else can look at it and say 'well I think what you're doing is going in the right direction' or 'I think somehow you're missing the point here'... so I use the internet for that kind of informal workshopping. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0122burnside3.ra\">Audio clip</a></p> <p><strong>In general, do you think the internet helps poetry become more accessible to people who wouldn't necessarily go into a bookshop and buy a collection?</strong></p> <p> I am very attached to the book, I have to say that. There's something about poetry on the page and holding a book in your hand which is very satisfying and special. I think it's good for people to use the internet to become aware of what's happening. I think what's happened in the past is that if you're a British reader you maybe tend to read British poets and may not be aware of what is going on in America. There are lots of interesting, different things going on in America. In the past one was only made aware of the mainstream of what was happening in another country. Now you can hear what's happening in more underground currents, alternative currents or peripheral currents as well as what's happening in the mainstream. People can go out into the internet and find out about poets they might not have necessarily have heard of otherwise. </p> <p>I think the other great thing are internet bookshops. You can find the kind of specialist bookshop that you used to be able to get on your doorstep and that are sadly dying out. For example, Powells, the American specialist bookshop, where you can find collections by rare poets or poets that haven't been widely published.</p> <p>The internet provides all kinds of possibilities of finding out what's really happening in the world as opposed to what people are trying to sell us. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0122burnside4.ra\">Audio clip</a></p> <p><strong>Moving on to awards and the Whitbread.

Poetry doesn't get widely reviewed in, say, the Sundays. Only a handful of poets get reviewed in the main areas of reviews whereas novelists tend to get more attention. I know from doing both (writing novels and poetry) that my novels have always had more attention than my poetry. If a poet wins an award, I think maybe they come to an audience that's wider than their usual poetry-specific audience, which is always a good thing. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0122burnside5.ra\">Audio clip</a></p> <p><strong>What are you reading at the moment?

It was about poetry and ecology which I think is an area which needs more exploration and he's done some wonderful things in that book. The other thing I've been reading recently is Don Delillo's new novel, The Body Artist, which I think is coming out quite soon, which I've got to review.

But it was always going to be a tough night. \"I haven't done a gig in a while and I'm a bit nervous,\" he admits, although his dedication overrides the rustiness. With eyes cast firmly downward he picks a gentle rhythm from his guitar, and as the crowd chatter on and pints of the black stuff are passed around, it's sink-or-swim time. </p> <p>Kitt's mini-album, Small Moments is a snapshot of lo-fi brilliance that is both accessible and loveable, and whimsical without becoming sickly. Each studied beat and distilled influenced melody is there because Kitt loves it and wants you to also. If David Gray had spent more time clubbing and listening to Charlie Mingus he could have sounded as cool as this. </p> <p>Another Love Song might fit snuggly into the so-called new-acoustic movement, were it not for the subtly distracting beats beneath the simple sweetness of the lyrics. The kids love it. \"You can sing louder, help me out,\" Kitt encourages, aware that if you can't beat 'em, it's wise to get 'em joining in. But the mass chorus betrays the fragility of the song cruelly. </p> <p>The faster tunes work best tonight. Headphones is sassy jazz-pop, while Pale Blue Light, from his forthcoming second album, is all breakbeats and jagged guitar, pointing to a more free-form, fuller sound. Kitt's voice is smooth and sublime as he moves his head and hips to its fractured dance rhythm, playing off against the deliberately discordant clarinet. There's a lot going on, but all subtlety is lost in the cave-like venue. </p> <p>Kitt at least appears to be enjoying himself. \"Having attended the better days of the end of house music here, it's very strange being up here,\" he tells us, finishing off the dregs of his own Guinness. Maybe it's the shared recollection of halcyon dancing days that ultimately endears Kitt to the crowd. That doesn't mean that they'll put down their pints and give him the respect he deserves, but they do show some affection, with warm applause and dewy-eyed looks from the girls. And when Kitt encores with a sparse version of the Specials' A Message to You, Rudy, he wins the war for their hearts at last.</p>",

Kitt at least appears to be enjoying himself. \"Having attended the better days of the end of house music here, it's very strange being up here,\" he tells us, finishing off the dregs of his own Guinness. Maybe it's the shared recollection of halcyon dancing days that ultimately endears Kitt to the crowd. That doesn't mean that they'll put down their pints and give him the respect he deserves, but they do show some affection, with warm applause and dewy-eyed looks from the girls. And when Kitt encores with a sparse version of the Specials' A Message to You, Rudy, he wins the war for their hearts at last.",

It leapt from the bottom to the top of the industry's league tables in 2000 as its decision to shun telecoms and technology stocks finally paid off. </p> <p>According to the Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps) annual survey of pension fund performance, the last time the average pension fund produced a negative return was in 1994. The only other occasion was in 1990. </p> <p>The survey, used by fund managers to try to persuade companies and local authorities to trust them with their pension schemes, shows that last year produced a reversal in fortunes for the fund management firms at the top and bottom of its league of 67 firms. </p> <p>The sharp divergence in the performance of the managers reflected the violent swings in the stock market during the year. </p> <p>The go-go stocks of 1999, telecoms and technology, which had hampered the performance of funds like P&amp;D, ended last year down 37% and 44% respectively. </p> <p>P&amp;D's place at the bottom was taken by the little-known Fuji, which topped the table at the end of 1999. </p> <p>According to Caps, the median return for the \u00a3210bn of pension funds it tracks was minus 3.8%. This includes their investment in UK and overseas equities as well as bonds and other assets such as property and cash. </p> <p>However, when investments in the British stock market alone are analysed, Caps concludes that last year was much better than the previous three years and showed that investors in index-tracking funds, the fad towards the end of the last decade, lost out. This is because even though the median return of so-called \"actively\" managed funds was again negative, it was better than the FTSE All-Share index which ended the year almost 6% lower. </p> <p>Nearly two-thirds of the funds beat the index, partly because of the distortion caused to the index by the entrance of technology firm Dimension Data in September. </p> <p>Caps said last year was the only year in its 25 years of records where every quarter had produced negative returns. </p> <p>Each quarter of the year also showed a reversal in the fortunes of the fund managers at the top and bottom of the league. </p> <p>They swapped places on a regular basis during the year and P&amp;D which ended at the top of the table had also languished at the bottom. </p> <p>The performance of P&amp;D was subjected to closer scrutiny than many of its rivals because its reversal in performance appeared to coincide with the departure of Tony Dye, its fund manager who called the market top four years too early.</p>",

According to the Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps) annual survey of pension fund performance, the last time the average pension fund produced a negative return was in 1994. The only other occasion was in 1990. The survey, used by fund managers to try to persuade companies and local authorities to trust them with their pension schemes, shows that last year produced a reversal in fortunes for the fund management firms at the top and bottom of its league of 67 firms. The sharp divergence in the performance of the managers reflected the violent swings in the stock market during the year. The go-go stocks of 1999, telecoms and technology, which had hampered the performance of funds like P&amp;D, ended last year down 37% and 44% respectively. P&amp;D's place at the bottom was taken by the little-known Fuji, which topped the table at the end of 1999. According to Caps, the median return for the \u00a3210bn of pension funds it tracks was minus 3.8%. This includes their investment in UK and overseas equities as well as bonds and other assets such as property and cash. However, when investments in the British stock market alone are analysed, Caps concludes that last year was much better than the previous three years and showed that investors in index-tracking funds, the fad towards the end of the last decade, lost out. This is because even though the median return of so-called \"actively\" managed funds was again negative, it was better than the FTSE All-Share index which ended the year almost 6% lower. Nearly two-thirds of the funds beat the index, partly because of the distortion caused to the index by the entrance of technology firm Dimension Data in September. Caps said last year was the only year in its 25 years of records where every quarter had produced negative returns. Each quarter of the year also showed a reversal in the fortunes of the fund managers at the top and bottom of the league. They swapped places on a regular basis during the year and P&amp;D which ended at the top of the table had also languished at the bottom. The performance of P&amp;D was subjected to closer scrutiny than many of its rivals because its reversal in performance appeared to coincide with the departure of Tony Dye, its fund manager who called the market top four years too early.",

Once you've realised that the titles exist separately from the works, that they are the gag, they begin to grate. This is typical: \"Of course!
