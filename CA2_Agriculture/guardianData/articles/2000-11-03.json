      "body": "<p>The clear and present danger for the government is the fuel protest. But hard on its heels comes the annual NHS winter crisis, as certain as the solstice. Often it is flammed up in the thin news time between Christmas and New Year, but last year on top of the millennium there was a genuine flu crisis. Now extraordinary measures with carrots and sticks are ready to try to stop it happening again, just before an election. </p> <p>The BBC's Today programme got off the mark a bit early this week with one of its regular winter surveys on how things are going in health authorities. Having done these myself in my time at the BBC, they are usually a sure fire hit as a story: not this time. Some 90% of health authorities said they were in a better position to deal with winter pressures than last year. These surveys take a long time to do, and it must be galling to get no headline at the end of it. So instead of leading with this key fact, they stuck it down at the bottom of their report and even said that the department of health \"claimed\" the 90% result, when in fact it was their own survey that \"found\" it. Downing Street rebutted sharply - and rightly. But all this is just a small taste of what is to come: if that's the BBC, wait for the Tory press to splash with any patient who gets less than the best in any hospital. The NHS is the frontline in the run-up to an election: truth is always the first casualty. </p> <p>The Tories are sharpening their knives and in some places this is starting to take a sinister turn as national politics are being played out locally over the home care, hospital beds and nursing homes for ill old people. The aim under all governments of the last 20 years has been to try to force the NHS and local social services to pool funds and work together to stop hospital beds being filled up with frail old people who have no need of very expensive acute care. Local teams of social services domiciliary care workers together with community nurses and GPs try to keep them at home, catching early signs of flu before it turns into pneumonia. Finding nursing homes to move the frailest into is a growing problem, but gradually the two sides have been working better together. However, suddenly a new political motivation rears its head. </p> <p>Many councils that were formerly Labour have switched to Tory control. Why should Tory councils direct money and effort towards relieving any possible winter chaos on the NHS? The winter planning group inside the Department of Health is getting messages back that there is suddenly far less cooperation as Tory-controlled social services are drained of cash for the old. Some members of the Association of Directors of Social Services confirm that they think there has been a deliberate moving of funds away from services for the old by some Tory-led councils this winter. </p> <p>The Labour group in Essex where the Tories took control question what is happening to social services there. Under the leadership of Lord Hanningfield, ennobled by William Hague, \u00a32m was slashed from social services and council tax was cut. By August, in financial meltdown after the tax cuts, they set up a team to report on future cuts. It is not due to report until the end of November, just when the old-and-cold winter care season begins. The fear is that a massive round of new cuts will strike just as the local NHS will be expecting help from social services. Bungling inefficiency, no doubt. But once in a squeeze, there is not (to put it at its very mildest) a great political incentive to channel scarce funds into care for the elderly to stop bed-blocking in local hospitals. Similar reports are coming in from around the country, with a suggestion that Conservative central office is taking a keen interest. </p> <p>However, to be fair, social services are under extreme pressure everywhere, in councils of all complexions. The chancellor ear-marked extra money for education and for children, but nothing for the frail old who are growing in number. A survey of social services two weeks ago found them badly strapped. If there is a winter crisis, the weakest point is here. For the NHS has had its largest dollop of cash for six years - a 7.4% increase. Talking to chief executives of health authorities, they say the money is there, buying more beds, more intensive care, more staff and - in a crisis - more treatment from the private sector. There are plenty of anxieties about lack of nurses - we are 30,000 short nationally - especially in rich areas where there is nowhere affordable for them to live. But broadly, most are not grumbling, which is news in itself. </p> <p> So the winter plans are laid and the thumb-screws ready for any health authority that fails. Every area has its winter planning group, answerable daily to the winter emergency services team inside the department of health. The head of one local winter team describes how much pressure they are under: \"It's been money with menaces, the political stakes are so high.\" There are calls almost daily from Whitehall. If any patient is left on a trolley waiting for a bed for more than 12 hours, the chief executive has to call the regional director, who calls Whitehall. Then, day or night, the chief executive must go in person to apologise humbly to the patient and the family. Last year this particular authority had to transfer patients needing intensive care a hundred miles away. \"This year that would be career suicide.\" Inside the bunker in Whitehall early warning systems prepare to zap rapid response teams into any hotspot, with extra money and managers. They will bring extra GPs into Accident and Emergency. Ambulances are kept in minute by minute contact, directing them to hospitals with lowest waiting times. Any over-65s have been seized and flu-jabbed, along with NHS staff. Deals are struck with private hospitals to take cold surgery cases, so waiting lists don't fall behind. This is war. </p> <p>But all is quite different inside the social services departments, though much will depend on them. They are not controlled by any central bunker. (The time may come.) They have had cuts, not increases. The Association of Social Services Directors says the south- east is hardest hit for services for the old, with no money to compensate for soaring costs. Old people with more capital now qualify for free care. Soon however rich, all will get three months free care and local social services will have to pay. The old live longer in their expensive nursing homes, costing more. Nursing homes are closing in the affluent south, as owners cash in on property values and staff are hard to find: 10,000 fewer nursing home places this year. The government needs to move fast to secure this missing link in its winter plans. It will be very difficult to prove that there are political shenanigans afoot in Tory-controlled councils deliberately provoking a winter crisis, when all social services are under genuinely critical pressure. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

If it is to succeed, Boo will need to find a magic ingredient to make its site more intriguing and content-rich. Email the Media Medium at maggie@companyguide.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>At the start of Harry, He's Here To Help, a French family is driving down the motorway in a rotten car for their summer holiday. It's blisteringly hot, but there's no air conditioning. The three daughters in the back are screaming. One of them starts kicking the driver's seat so that the stressed father gets a royal pain in the small of his back. </p> <p>We cut to Michel's sweaty, hangdog face, fringed by the kind of hairdo that that hasn't been popular since the Battle of Agincourt, and perhaps not even then. He's a ground-down thirtysomething who once dreamed of being a great writer but now teaches French at night school. He wanted to be happy and fulfilled but now he's driving down the Autoroute du Soleil to spend his holiday doing building work on the family's tumbledown farmhouse in the Auvergne which has become a source of stress and a drain on his money. How did he get this way? How can he change? </p> <p>At a service station, he and his wife change the baby's nappy and Michel finds a man looking at him fixedly. The man is Harry, who claims to be an old school friend. Michel can't place him, but the man insists. In the car park they meet again. Harry and his girlfriend have a lovely Mercedes and they offer to drive his children to the farmhouse in air-conditioned splendour. Michel and his wife, Claire, agree so long as Claire travels in the Mercedes too. </p> <p>We cut to Harry at the wheel. Harry's an enigma wrapped in top-of-the-range German air conditioning and backed by a soothing opera soundtrack from a state-of-the-art car stereo. Where did he come from? How did he become rich? Why does his girlfriend look like a pneumatic parody of Jean Harlow? Even his name is a puzzle: Harry isn't a common name in France. Not since the psycho killer in George Sluizer's The Vanishing has anyone quite so troubling hung around French service stations and insinuated themselves so disturbingly into other people's lives. </p> <p>But Harry, even if he is a serial killer, comes not to bury Michel, but to praise him. Over dinner that evening, he recites from memory a poem Michel wrote for a school magazine nearly 20 years earlier. He clearly admires Michel, and wants him to return to his creative muse. And he's quite prepared to kill anybody who stands in Michel's way or upsets him. For instance, from the moment we see that Michel's overbearing parents have taken the liberty of installing a disgusting pink bathroom in his farmhouse without asking his permission, we know they are in trouble with Harry. </p> <p>Harry is the psychoanalytical flipside to repressed Michel, who is incapable of standing up to his parents let alone taking hold of his destiny. But Harry is also - and this is what makes his character so interesting - the conscience of the film. He suffers for being an angel of vengeance for Michel. After one killing, he drives through the night howling wildly. He also eats a raw egg after each of his many orgasms during the film, but that's not important right now. In short, Harry's just the kind of stand-up friend a guy would want, but never has. At least in reality. </p> <p>This disturbing, blackly comic suspense film has been a remarkable success in France, taking \u00a310m since it was released at the start of August. But it should do well in Britain, too, since its dark humour is very attuned to our sick sensibilities. </p> <p>Why has the film become one of the few pictures to keep the tricolour flying in the French box office charts this summer? The gangly, German-born director, Dominik Moll, takes a slug from his caf\u00e9 cr\u00e9me and a pull on his cigarette. \"It's difficult to analyse why it is a success. The film clearly touched a lot of people. It's not really the kind of film that succeeds in France normally - it's a black comedy, a little Hitchcockian and surreal. I'm a great fan of Monty Python - even when they're not funny. I think the film comes from that background.\" </p> <p>Moll, 38, wrote the script for Harry after renovating and decorating a home for himself and his family. Is Michel based on Dominik? \"No, it's not as straightforward as that. But there is something of my biography in there. When I first started thinking about the story, my girlfriend and I were in the throes of young parenthood. Our everyday life was in constant havoc due to our two little daughters: endless practical problems to solve, the lack of time and sleep, the irritation and exhaustion. There always comes a time when you can't take any more and you wonder out loud, 'How the hell did I get myself into this mess?' I realised that most of my friends who had kids were going through the same experience. Then I wondered what would happen if someone came into my life and took all those problems away, and how wonderful that would be.\" </p> <p>And strange? \"Yes, Harry is strange. But it would be strange if a person came into your life and sorted out your problems. There's a scene in the film in which Harry buys Michel a new air-conditioned 4x4 and, while Michel says he can't accept it (it's a ludicrously expensive gift from someone he barely knows), in practice he does. </p> <p>\"In my first film, Intimacy, an adaptation of Sartre, there was a female character who interfered in a couple's life. But with Harry, I wanted a character who wasn't overtly evil. In fact he's a complicated, even sympathetic character, and part of the reason for that is that Sergi Lopez, who plays Harry, has only played good guys up till now.\" (Lopez starred in the Brittany road movie Western and in last year's Une Liaison Pornographique.) </p> <p>Why is he called Harry? \"I wanted to give him an outsider's status and an otherworldliness. Again, Sergi brings that because he's a Catalan in a French film, but that was merely an accident. No one in France is called Harry, so immediately he is an outsider. But everybody who goes to the movies is aware of the Harrys of cinema - Dirty Harry, The Trouble with Harry, Deconstructing Harry, Harry Lime. They're all enigmas to varying degrees. The same is true of Harry's girlfriend who we constructed as a Hollywood starlet. Both of these characters are creatures of cinema rather than real-life people.\" </p> <p>Moll is a creature of cinema, too. When he was growing up in the spa town of Baden-Baden in Germany, he used to buy Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, the analytical French film journal. \"I subscribed to it, even though my French was so bad then that I barely understood a word. I remember struggling for ages with an article by the director Olivier Assayas, and it was worth it because it taught me lots of technical things. Later, I read the conversations between Hitchock and Truffaut and that was influential too.\" </p> <p>When he was 19, he arrived in Paris, knowing no one. \"I had this great desire to make films and it seemed best to go to France. There's such a culture of film here.\" The Hitchcock influence runs very deep. \"I love Hitchock: for me, he is the director who makes films that are not only entertaining but, more importantly, he concentrates his narrative so nothing is left out.\" </p> <p>Moll's characters are Hitchockian: their notions of good and evil is different from ours and so, appealingly, we are never quite sure what they will do next. And much of the film's powerful suspense grows from our uncertainty about who will get bumped off next and why. </p> <p>Moll's first feature film, Intimacy, was released in 1994, but was not a hit. As a result it was six years until Moll was able to film Harry. \"That fallow period has made me have a very cool head. Because of Harry's success, I am under a lot of pressure to come up with another box office hit, to get a film made as soon as possible. But I haven't got one and I won't be panicked into creating one. I'm dabbling with a script and maybe, maybe, I'll start filming in 2002.\" </p> <p>Could it be another Harry movie? \"Maybe,\" Moll grins. That's the trouble with Harry. You never know what he'll do next. </p> <p>\u0095 Harry, He's Here to Help is released in the UK next Friday.</p>",

Not everything I have done since 1997 has been perfect and I will always be honest where policies need improvement - on exclusions, for example. Most people recognise that much has been achieved in education since 1997 - but we need to do more.</p> <p>Nick Davies claims that he undertook an \"in-depth study\" into my department, when he did no such thing. He was given plenty of facts, yet simply distorted them. Let me take his charges in turn.</p> <p>First, money. The \u00a319bn was a cumulative sum. The press release on July 14 1998, when the money was announced, quoted me as saying: \"In 2002, we will be spending \u00a311bn more on education than the last administration planned to spend this year.\" It didn't take much detective work to find that out. The release also gave real terms figures.</p> <p>This was money that the Tories were not prepared to spend, as is the money in the second spending review, which the Tories will cut. It means that on average, \u00a3300 more per pupil in real terms is being spent in schools this year than in 1997. That was after a \u00a360 per pupil cut over the previous three years. Three times as much money is being spent on school capital this year than in 1996-97. We have direct grants worth up to \u00a370,000 each next year for schools to spend as they choose. There is more needed - and it will come as a result of the spending review, where real term spending will rise by \u00a3370 more per pupil. It is absurd to pretend that there has not been a substantial increase in funding.</p> <p>Second, standards. In primary schools, I set two main objectives - to cut infant class sizes and improve literacy and numeracy. The numbers in classes over 30 are down to 30,000 now (it was nearly 480,000 in 1997). Literacy and numeracy standards are rising. Davies may think it unimportant that children are taught the 3Rs effectively. I don't. Learning to read, to spell, to write and to count cannot wait until we sort out the disadvantages that have bedevilled generation after generation of youngsters.</p> <p>Third, failing schools. Fresh Start is one part of our approach. It was not imported from the US, but first announced at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers conference in 1995 for schools which persist in failing and would otherwise have to close. Fresh Start is a last resort by education authorities in just 25 of the most difficult schools in the country. It takes time and determination to succeed. Most such schools have improved discipline and pupils' willingness to work, the first step towards better results.</p> <p>Our main strategy on failing schools has seen over 500 come out of special measures since the election and a further 100 closed, with pupils transferred to better local schools. The time it takes to turn around such schools has fallen from 25 to 18 months. We are beginning to improve schools in areas that have been neglected for so long that the eulogies to equality of opportunity rang rather hollow in parents' ears. These are important achievements, the result of work by dedicated people of whom Davies is contemptuous.</p> <p>Finally, of course we must improve secondary schools - and we have started to do so. Inner city secondaries have dedicated staff to deal with truancy and disaffection. Davies dismisses these learning mentors, yet schools with mentors see them as a way to free teachers to teach and to re-engage with families cut off from education. There are programmes to stretch gifted pupils. And there is much more support both inside and outside the school to deal with disruptive pupils. We are also improving vocational alternatives for young people. This programme - Excellence in Cities - will, by next September, cover as many as a third of all secondary schools.</p> <p>Our approach doesn't patronise those of us who know poverty but it is already beginning to give schools the wherewithal to overcome that poverty. I know Excellence in Cities is having an effect because I talk to heads and teachers who benefit from it. But it isn't compulsory.</p> <p>We are also moving towards free universal nursery education for all three- and four-year-olds. Sure Start is giving help and support to young mums living in poverty. Further and higher education are getting the funding they deserve. There is more money for substantially improved teacher pay, salaries for trainee teachers and teachers' professional development than ever before.</p> <p>Mr Davies may regard all these as \"dinky little schemes\". He may want us to forget about improving our schools until we solve world poverty. To do so would be wholly wrong. I went into politics to represent the people I grew up with in Sheffield - to make a real difference to their life chances. I have no intention of forgetting my roots - and that means children on estates in my constituency learning to read and write and schools having the backing they need to deal with their day-to-day problems. They didn't get that support with the Conservatives. They are beginning to get it under Labour - and frankly, that matters a lot more to me and to my constituents than refighting the theological battles of the 1980s.</p> <p>\u0095 David Blunkett MP is secretary of state for education and employment</p>",

Our approach doesn't patronise those of us who know poverty but it is already beginning to give schools the wherewithal to overcome that poverty. I know Excellence in Cities is having an effect because I talk to heads and teachers who benefit from it. But it isn't compulsory. We are also moving towards free universal nursery education for all three- and four-year-olds. Sure Start is giving help and support to young mums living in poverty. Further and higher education are getting the funding they deserve. There is more money for substantially improved teacher pay, salaries for trainee teachers and teachers' professional development than ever before. Mr Davies may regard all these as \"dinky little schemes\". He may want us to forget about improving our schools until we solve world poverty. To do so would be wholly wrong. I went into politics to represent the people I grew up with in Sheffield - to make a real difference to their life chances. I have no intention of forgetting my roots - and that means children on estates in my constituency learning to read and write and schools having the backing they need to deal with their day-to-day problems. They didn't get that support with the Conservatives. They are beginning to get it under Labour - and frankly, that matters a lot more to me and to my constituents than refighting the theological battles of the 1980s. \u0095 David Blunkett MP is secretary of state for education and employment",

I am proud of what I have achieved and, with an election coming up, this was an appropriate moment to move on.</p> <p>\"I do not think I have been abrasive in the sense that I have set out to ruffle feathers. What I have set out to do is to speak plainly.\"</p> <p>Mr Woodhead finally agreed to go at a meeting yesterday with Sir Michael Bichard, permanent secretary at the Department for Education and Employment, and cabinet secretary Sir Richard Wilson.</p> <p>Mr Blunkett believed the situation was made intolerable by a leader yesterday in the Daily Telegraph - the paper the chief inspector is to join - which described Mr Woodhead as \"a valuable source of well-informed criticism\".</p> <p>Government sources said Mr Woodhead would effectively leave his post as chief inspector at the end of this month, giving him three months' paid leave before he joins the Telegraph as a consultant on \"educational, cultural and social matters\" in the spring. He will also work no more than two days a week for Bell Pottinger Public Affairs, the company chaired by Lord Bell, Lady Thatcher's former public relations guru, as an adviser on \"regulatory issues\" - but not, Lord Bell said, on education.</p> <p>Mr Woodhead, who was earning \u00a3124,000 plus a bonus of up to 10%, was not due to leave his job until September 2003.

      "bodyText": "Chris Woodhead, the chief inspector of schools in England, resigned suddenly last night to the undisguised relief of the education secretary, David Blunkett, and outright joy of the teacher unions. Union leaders queued up to wish good riddance to the man who had been the most vocal critic of the teaching profession over six tumultuous years but who enjoyed the support of Tony Blair. Mr Blunkett's - and eventually Mr Blair's - patience ran out when the education secretary discovered Mr Woodhead had been secretly negotiating his exit from the job to go into media and public relations. In the wake of bitter clashes between Mr Woodhead and MPs on the Commons education select committee, Mr Blunkett and Mr Blair spoke on Wednesday night. Mr Blair finally conceded that the head of Ofsted had to go. Mr Woodhead said last night: \"I think I have done my bit for Ofsted. I am proud of what I have achieved and, with an election coming up, this was an appropriate moment to move on. \"I do not think I have been abrasive in the sense that I have set out to ruffle feathers. What I have set out to do is to speak plainly.\" Mr Woodhead finally agreed to go at a meeting yesterday with Sir Michael Bichard, permanent secretary at the Department for Education and Employment, and cabinet secretary Sir Richard Wilson. Mr Blunkett believed the situation was made intolerable by a leader yesterday in the Daily Telegraph - the paper the chief inspector is to join - which described Mr Woodhead as \"a valuable source of well-informed criticism\". Government sources said Mr Woodhead would effectively leave his post as chief inspector at the end of this month, giving him three months' paid leave before he joins the Telegraph as a consultant on \"educational, cultural and social matters\" in the spring. He will also work no more than two days a week for Bell Pottinger Public Affairs, the company chaired by Lord Bell, Lady Thatcher's former public relations guru, as an adviser on \"regulatory issues\" - but not, Lord Bell said, on education. Mr Woodhead, who was earning \u00a3124,000 plus a bonus of up to 10%, was not due to leave his job until September 2003. But, he told Mr Blunkett in his resignation letter: \"The time has come for me to move on and make a contribution in different ways.\" Mr Woodhead delighted conservatives and infuriated liberals with his regular assaults on the education profession, beginning in his first week in September 1994 when he called for incompetent teachers to be sacked. He later said 15,000 teachers were incompetent. The education secretary would have been happy to see Mr Woodhead resign long ago, but refused to join calls for him to go when it was alleged that he had an affair with Amanda Johnston, a pupil of his, while she was still at school. The couple later lived together but insisted that their relationship had begun once she left school. In September, Mr Woodhead returned from holiday and, in an interview with the Guardian, angered ministers by calling for A-levels to be made more difficult. Three and a half weeks ago Mr Blunkett called Mr Woodhead into his office after learning that he was negotiating to join the Telegraph and was looking for other work. The education secretary was determined not to allow Mr Woodhead to dictate his departure if he had already decided to go and made it clear he was prepared to nip the problem in the bud by sacking him if necessary. In an exchange of letters, Mr Blunkett thanked Mr Woodhead for his \"significant con tribution to our shared goal of raising standards in schools\". He said later in interviews: \"I think anyone who feels that their role is better to be played writing for the Daily Telegraph or being a consultant to a PR company has obviously found a different niche in life.\" Mr Woodhead told the Guardian recently that his paper of choice on holiday was the Times. Mr Woodhead's short-term replacement is Ofsted's deputy inspector, Mike Tomlinson, who once said \"I don't give a monkey's toss for teachers\", but is generally regarded as a more conciliatory figure. Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: \"There will be no tears only cheers at Chris Woodhead's departure. Everything he has done has demoralised teachers. \" William Hague, the Tory leader, said last night: \"Chris Woodhead's resignation leaves Labour's education policy in tatters. While he was chief inspector of schools parents could be sure that they had a powerful champion of high standards. Now that reassurance has gone.\" From the archive: 18 September 1999: Woodhead letter in reaction to Nick Davies article 22 April, 1999: Decca Aitkenhead profiles Woodhead and his sex scandal Useful links: Ofsted Department for Education and Employment National Union of Teachers online NASUWT DFEE press release on Woodhead's resignation",

      "bodyText": "Garry Kasparov's 15-year reign as chess world champion ended yesterday when his former protege, Vladimir Kramnik, secured the draw he needed to win the title. For Kasparov (above), who failed to win a game in the match, it was a tame end to an epic tenure as champion. Kasparov, who has dominated the sport since he won the title at 22, finished the match at the Riverside Studios in Hammersmith, west London, much as he had begun it: looking exhausted and bewildered. \"I was totally out-prepared,\" he said. \"It was difficult to play without openings as white, and I exhausted myself trying to rebuild my opening repertoire.\" Unlike the icy Kramnik, who gives nothing away at the board, Kasparov never hides his feelings when under pressure. Earlier this week he hinted that personal problems had undermined his title defence. Asked why his play had been so lacklustre, he replied: \"It's a long story. I will tell you when the match is over. I am tired. I don't hide it.\" Yesterday he refused to expand on what those problems were. Yesterday's game was the 15th of the match, and by drawing Kramnik, who is 25, took an unassailable 8.5-6.5 lead. Kasparov made all the running and had a slight advantage for much of the game, but could not force a win. He showed flickers of his old self in the latter stages of the match, but it was too late to repair the damage of two early defeats.",

      "body": "<p>The conviction of an openly racist psychopath for the murder of his Asian cellmate in Feltham young offenders' institution has once again focused attention on conditions within Britain's largest youth custody centre. Variously described by former deputy governor Ian Thomas as Dickensian, and by the chief inspector of prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham, as \"rotten to the core\", Feltham symbolises the malaise in Britain's prison system.</p> <p>Zahid Mubarek, 19, was battered to death in March at Feltham by his cellmate Robert Stewart, who was jailed for life for murder on Wednesday. The pair were allocated the same cell at Feltham, despite Stewart's record of violence against fellow prisoners and hundreds of letters in which he expressed his extreme racist views.</p> <p>Currently home to 631 young offenders between 15 and 21, Feltham, in Hounslow, south-west London, is operating under capacity. The chances of that situation lasting are slim. It is the only young offenders' institution serving all courts in greater London and most of the south of England. Understaffed and periodically overpopulated, it is home to some of the most disruptive youths in the country.</p> <p>By almost any measure it is a failing institution. Sir David, reporting in December 1998, was unequivocal. \"This report ... into Feltham is, without doubt, the most disturbing that I have had to make during my three years as HM chief inspector of prisons,\" he wrote in the preface to his report.</p> <p>\"I have to disclose to the public not only that conditions and treatment of the 922 children and young prisoners confined _ are, in many instances, totally unacceptable. They ... reveal a history of neglect of those committed to their charge and a failure to meet the demands of society to tackle the problem of offending behaviour.\"</p> <p>He found a regime that routinely confined prisoners to cells 23 and a half hours a day, failed to provide sufficient activities and exercise for its inmates and was routinely filthy. It is blighted by violence - there have been more than 5,000 prisoner-on-prisoner assaults in the last 10 years and seven suicides. There have been four governors in six months. The latest to take up the challenge is Nick Pascoe.</p> <p>Yesterday he acknowledged the difficulties he faces. \"We have accepted the need for change at Feltham and I am looking forward to getting down to the job of improving the regime,\" he said.</p> <p>\"Much needs to be done but my priority is to give Feltham the stability it desperately needs.\"</p> <p><b> Overcrowded</b><br> Mr Pascoe's approach were welcomed by Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust. According to Ms Lyon, his problems are fourfold. Feltham is overcrowded, has suffered a crisis of management, fails utterly to provide appropriate treatment for prisoners with mental health problems and is afflicted by racism, she said.</p> <p>\"The first thing Feltham needs is a period of stable leadership. There have been four governors in the last six months. If it was a failing school we would tolerate perhaps two changes of headmaster in that time, but Feltham isn't a school; it is responsible for some of the most vulnerable and volatile young men in society.\"</p> <p>\"It needs a period of stability, to be scaled down to a manageable size, and for the authorities to face up to the real problems of mental health inside the institution.\"</p> <p>For three years Peter Misch, a forensic psychologist specialising in adolescent behaviour, faced those challenges on a daily basis at Feltham. He was horrified by what he found.</p> <p>\"Feltham exceeded every negative report I heard about it. The level of emotional and psychiatric disturbance in enormous; it was mind bogglingly high,\" he said.</p> <p>\"People who were acutely psychotic were locked up for 23 and a half hours a day, there was a lack of resources, no integral sanitation in the medical wing which rendered it filthy at times and you have to bear in mind the basic brutality of banging up 15-year-olds. Episodes of violence were depressingly frequent, we saw epidemics of self-harm and 25 hanging attempts in a single week.</p> <p>\"There are a lot of good people at Feltham and a small number of extraordinarily devoted staff but with the lack of resources it was just impossible to provide appropriate care.\"</p> <p>The prison service points to recent improvements in the reception and screening processes at Feltham that they say would have prevented Robert Stewart and Zahid Mubarek sharing a cell. It would also have identified Stewart's psychopathy, they say.</p> <p>But critics point out that incidents such as the one that left Mr Mubarek dead will continue to occur unless the practice of imprisoning 15- and 16-year-olds on juvenile wings is ended. These children, say the critics, are too young and too vulnerable to be exposed to the harsh regime of a prison.</p> <p>\"The majority of children should undoubtedly be kept in the community as long as possible,\" said Frances Crook, director of the Howard League for Penal Reform.</p> <p>\"At Feltham, you have 40 or 50 children who are simply learning the ropes of crime. The knock-on effects of introducing these kids to prison are huge. They learn the ropes of a place like Feltham at an early age and learn disruptive skills that make life harder for prison officers and other inmates.</p> <p>\"Far from reducing the chances of people becoming victims of crime, they increase it. I am far more likely to have my handbag nicked, and get punched in the face in the process, because these children are imprisoned.\"</p> <p>There is support for this argument in the case of Robert Stewart. In care from the age of 14, he was inducted into the prison service as soon as he was old enough, receiving his first custodial sentence at 15. Over the next five years he became institutionalised, losing any points of reference other than those of prison life and valuing the respect of no one except his peers inside. In the process, he graduated from petty thief to murderer.</p> <p><b> Survival</b><br> A psychiatrist giving evidence at the murder trial testified that in addition to his obvious racism and psychopathy, Stewart was motivated by a need to win the respect so vital to survival in prison.

      "bodyText": "The conviction of an openly racist psychopath for the murder of his Asian cellmate in Feltham young offenders' institution has once again focused attention on conditions within Britain's largest youth custody centre. Variously described by former deputy governor Ian Thomas as Dickensian, and by the chief inspector of prisons, Sir David Ramsbotham, as \"rotten to the core\", Feltham symbolises the malaise in Britain's prison system. Zahid Mubarek, 19, was battered to death in March at Feltham by his cellmate Robert Stewart, who was jailed for life for murder on Wednesday. The pair were allocated the same cell at Feltham, despite Stewart's record of violence against fellow prisoners and hundreds of letters in which he expressed his extreme racist views. Currently home to 631 young offenders between 15 and 21, Feltham, in Hounslow, south-west London, is operating under capacity. The chances of that situation lasting are slim. It is the only young offenders' institution serving all courts in greater London and most of the south of England. Understaffed and periodically overpopulated, it is home to some of the most disruptive youths in the country. By almost any measure it is a failing institution. Sir David, reporting in December 1998, was unequivocal. \"This report ... into Feltham is, without doubt, the most disturbing that I have had to make during my three years as HM chief inspector of prisons,\" he wrote in the preface to his report. \"I have to disclose to the public not only that conditions and treatment of the 922 children and young prisoners confined _ are, in many instances, totally unacceptable. They ... reveal a history of neglect of those committed to their charge and a failure to meet the demands of society to tackle the problem of offending behaviour.\" He found a regime that routinely confined prisoners to cells 23 and a half hours a day, failed to provide sufficient activities and exercise for its inmates and was routinely filthy. It is blighted by violence - there have been more than 5,000 prisoner-on-prisoner assaults in the last 10 years and seven suicides. There have been four governors in six months. The latest to take up the challenge is Nick Pascoe. Yesterday he acknowledged the difficulties he faces. \"We have accepted the need for change at Feltham and I am looking forward to getting down to the job of improving the regime,\" he said. \"Much needs to be done but my priority is to give Feltham the stability it desperately needs.\" Overcrowded Mr Pascoe's approach were welcomed by Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust. According to Ms Lyon, his problems are fourfold. Feltham is overcrowded, has suffered a crisis of management, fails utterly to provide appropriate treatment for prisoners with mental health problems and is afflicted by racism, she said. \"The first thing Feltham needs is a period of stable leadership. There have been four governors in the last six months. If it was a failing school we would tolerate perhaps two changes of headmaster in that time, but Feltham isn't a school; it is responsible for some of the most vulnerable and volatile young men in society.\" \"It needs a period of stability, to be scaled down to a manageable size, and for the authorities to face up to the real problems of mental health inside the institution.\" For three years Peter Misch, a forensic psychologist specialising in adolescent behaviour, faced those challenges on a daily basis at Feltham. He was horrified by what he found. \"Feltham exceeded every negative report I heard about it. The level of emotional and psychiatric disturbance in enormous; it was mind bogglingly high,\" he said. \"People who were acutely psychotic were locked up for 23 and a half hours a day, there was a lack of resources, no integral sanitation in the medical wing which rendered it filthy at times and you have to bear in mind the basic brutality of banging up 15-year-olds. Episodes of violence were depressingly frequent, we saw epidemics of self-harm and 25 hanging attempts in a single week. \"There are a lot of good people at Feltham and a small number of extraordinarily devoted staff but with the lack of resources it was just impossible to provide appropriate care.\" The prison service points to recent improvements in the reception and screening processes at Feltham that they say would have prevented Robert Stewart and Zahid Mubarek sharing a cell. It would also have identified Stewart's psychopathy, they say. But critics point out that incidents such as the one that left Mr Mubarek dead will continue to occur unless the practice of imprisoning 15- and 16-year-olds on juvenile wings is ended. These children, say the critics, are too young and too vulnerable to be exposed to the harsh regime of a prison. \"The majority of children should undoubtedly be kept in the community as long as possible,\" said Frances Crook, director of the Howard League for Penal Reform. \"At Feltham, you have 40 or 50 children who are simply learning the ropes of crime. The knock-on effects of introducing these kids to prison are huge. They learn the ropes of a place like Feltham at an early age and learn disruptive skills that make life harder for prison officers and other inmates. \"Far from reducing the chances of people becoming victims of crime, they increase it. I am far more likely to have my handbag nicked, and get punched in the face in the process, because these children are imprisoned.\" There is support for this argument in the case of Robert Stewart. In care from the age of 14, he was inducted into the prison service as soon as he was old enough, receiving his first custodial sentence at 15. Over the next five years he became institutionalised, losing any points of reference other than those of prison life and valuing the respect of no one except his peers inside. In the process, he graduated from petty thief to murderer. Survival A psychiatrist giving evidence at the murder trial testified that in addition to his obvious racism and psychopathy, Stewart was motivated by a need to win the respect so vital to survival in prison. He reasoned that the quickest way to that was violence. The message does not appear to have reached the courts. There has been an 11% increase in the number of children between 12 and 17 in detention in the last 12 months as magistrates have embraced the government's detention and training orders. Of 2,929 in custody, 209 are in Feltham. Mrs Crook said fewer than 20 of them should be there. Her solution is straightforward: \"Close the juvenile wing at Feltham, take the kids out because it just isn't working.\" Richard Garside, of the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders, concurs. \"There is a strong argument for knocking Feltham down and building a new institution in the same place,\" he said. \"We would be shocked if we found the same conditions that exist in Feltham in a Romanian jail, but somehow it is acceptable in south London. The time has come to accept that it is not.\"",

So how are you? \"I'm all right.\" Good, good. And you're looking after yourself, we trust? \"I go swimming and jogging.\" That's super! Eating well? \"A friend brings me food every two days.\" That's nice. I suppose you've been keeping up with the latest action in the Bundesl... oh look, he's run away again. THE RUMOUR MILL Fulham are preparing a club-record \u00a36m bid for giant Anderlecht striker Jan Koller. The 6ft 7in Czech international will be put up for sale if his team fail to qualify for the next phase of Big Cup next week. Coventry defender Colin Hendry is expected to sign for Bolton on a free transfer. Tottenham winger Jose Domingues could soon be on his way to Peterborough, according to Teamtalk.

Airdrie supporters provided a cheque for \u00a315,000 to KPMG which has been accepted, allowing the Diamonds to play tomorrow. \"It is business as usual and I am taking training as usual,\" said Archibald. Blackburn have finally signed Brad Friedel from Liverpool after having initial problems securing a work-permit. Alex Ferguson has admitted that his current deputy Steve McClaren is ready to take over as manager of Manchester United when he steps down in 2002. \"It's not my decision but I think that the credentials are there,\" Ferguson said. \"Steve's at the stage when he can make a step like that.\" Roma striker Marco Delvecchio has admitted he nearly moved to the Premiership earlier this season. \"I was very close to coming to England this September,\" he revealed. \"Perhaps one day I will play in the Premiership.\" Hibs manager Alex McLeish has won the Bank of Scotland manager-of-the-month award in the SPL.

      "body": "<p>It all began some time in the last century, in an age when lovers wrote letters to each other sealed up in envelopes. Sometimes they used coloured inks to show their love, or they perfumed their writing-paper with scent. </p> <p>41 Plough Lane,<br>Hampstead,<br>London NW3<br> <br> Monday, June 2nd 1980<br> <br></p> <p>Darling Ned -</p> <p>I'm sorry about the smell. I hope you've opened this somewhere private, all on your own. You'll get teased to distraction otherwise. It's called Rive Gauche, so I'm feeling like Simone de Beauvoir and I hope you're feeling like Jean-Paul Sartre. Actually I hope you aren't because I think he was pretty horrid to her. I'm writing this upstairs after a row with Pete and Hillary. Ha, ha, ha! Pete and Hillary, Pete and Hillary, Pete and Hillary. You hate it when I call them that, don't you? I love you so much. If you saw my diary you'd die. I wrote a whole two pages this morning. I drew up a list of everything that's wonderful and glorious about you and one day when we're together for ever I might let you look at it and you'll die again.</p> <p>I wrote that you're old-fashioned.</p> <p>One: the first time we met you stood up when I entered the room, which was sweet, but it was the Hard Rock Cafe and I was coming out of the kitchen to take your order.</p> <p>Two: every time I refer to my mum and dad as Peter and Hillary, you go pink and tighten your lips.</p> <p>Three: when you first talked to Pete and ... all right, I'll let you off - when you first talked to Mum and Dad, you let them go on and on about private education and private health and how terrible it was and how evil the government is and you never said a word. About your dad being a Tory MP, I mean. You talked beautifully about the weather and incomprehensibly about cricket. But you never let on.</p> <p>That's what the row today was about, in fact. Your dad was on Weekend World at lunchtime, you prolly saw him. (I love you, by the way. God, I love you so much.)</p> <p>'Where do they find them?' barked Pete, stabbing a finger at the television. 'Where do they find them?'</p> <p>'Find who?' I said coldly, gearing up for a fight.</p> <p>'Whom,' said Hillary.</p> <p>'These tweed-jacketed throwbacks,' said Pete. 'Look at the old fart. What right has he got to talk about the miners? He wouldn't recognise a lump of coal if it fell into his bowl of Brown Windsor soup.'</p> <p>'You remember the boy I brought home last week?' I said, with what I'm pretty sure any observer would call icy calm.</p> <p>'Job security he says!' Peter yelled at the screen. 'When have you ever had to worry about job security, Mr Eton, Oxford and the Guards?' Then he turned to me. 'Hm? What boy? When?'</p> <p>He always does that when you ask him a question - says something else first, completely off the subject, and then answers your question with one (or more) of his own. Drives me mad. (So do you, darling Neddy. But mad with deepest love.) If you were to say to my father, 'Pete, what year was the battle of Hastings?' he'd say, 'They're cutting back on unemployment benefit. In real terms it's gone down by 5% in just two years. 5%. Bastards. Hastings? Why do you want to know? Why Hastings? Hastings was nothing but a clash between warlords and robber barons. The only battle worth knowing about is the battle between ...' and he'd be off. He knows it drives me mad. I think it prolly drives Hillary mad too. Anyway, I persevered.</p> <p>'The boy I brought home,' I said. 'His name was Ned. You remember him perfectly well. It was his half term. He came into the Hard Rock two weeks ago.'</p> <p>'The Sloane Ranger in the cricket jumper, what about him?'</p> <p>'He is not a Sloane Ranger!'</p> <p>'Looked like one to me. Didn't he look like a Sloane Ranger to you, Hills?'</p> <p>'He was certainly very polite,' Hillary said.</p> <p>'Exactly.' Pete returned to the bloody TV where there was a shot of your dad trying to address a group of Yorkshire miners, which I have to admit was quite funny. 'Look at that! First time the old fascist has ever been north of Watford in his life, I guarantee you. Except when he's passing through on his way to Scotland to murder grouse. Unbelievable. Unbelievable.'</p> <p>'Never mind Watford, when did you last go north of Hampstead?' I said. Well, shouted. Which was fair I think, because he was driving me mad and he can be such a hypocrite sometimes.</p> <p>Hillary went all don't-you-talk-to-your-father-like-that-ish and then got back to her article. She's doing a new column now, for Spare Rib, and gets ratty very easily.</p> <p>'You seem to have forgotten that I took my doctorate at Sheffield University,' Pete said, as if that qualified him for the Northerner of the Decade Award.</p> <p>'Never mind that,' I went on. 'The point is Ned just happens to be that man's son.' And I pointed at the screen with a very exultant finger. Unfortunately the man on camera just at that moment was the presenter.</p> <p>Pete turned to me with a look of awe. 'That boy is Brian Walden's son?' he said hoarsely. 'You're going out with Brian Walden's son?'</p> <p>It seems that Brian Walden, the presenter, used to be a Labour MP. For one moment Pete had this picture of me stepping out with socialist royalty. I could see his brain rapidly trying to calculate the chances of his worming his way into Brian Walden's confidence (father-in-law to father-in-law) wangling a seat in the next election and progressing triumphantly from the dull grind of the Inner London Education Authority to the thrill and glamour of the House of Commons and national fame. Peter Fendeman, maverick firebrand and hero of the workers, I watched the whole fantasy pass through his greedy eyes. Disgusting.</p> <p>'Not him!' I said. 'Him!' Your father had appeared back on screen again, now striding towards the door of Number Ten with papers tucked under his arm.</p> <p>I love you, Ned. I love you more than the tides love the moon. More than Mickey loves Minnie and Pooh loves honey. I love your big dark eyes and your sweet round bum. I love your mess of hair and your very red lips. They are very red in fact, I bet you didn't know that. Very few people have lips that really are red in the way that poets write about red. Yours are the reddest red, a redder red than ever I read of, and I want them all over me right now - but oh, no matter how red your lips, how round your bum, how big your eyes, it's you that I love. When I saw you standing there at Table Sixteen, smiling at me, it was as if you were entirely without a body at all. I had come out of the kitchen in a foul mood and there shining in front of me I saw this soul. This Ned. This you. A naked soul smiling at me like the sun and I knew I would die if I didn't spend the rest of my life with it.</p> <p>But still, how I wished this afternoon that your father were a union leader, a teacher in a comprehensive school, the editor of the Morning Star, Brian Walden himself - anything but Charles Maddstone, war hero, retired Brigadier of the Guards, ex colonial administrator. Most of all, how I wish he was anything but a cabinet minister in a Conservative government.</p> <p>That's not right though, is it? You wouldn't be you then, would you?</p> <p>When Pete and Hillary both got it, they stared from me to the screen and back again. Hillary even looked at the chair you sat in the day you came round. Glared at the thing as if she wanted it disinfected and burned.</p> <p>'Oh, Portia!' she said in what they used to call 'tragic accents'.</p> <p>Pete, of course, after going as red as Lenin, swallowed his rage and his baffled pride and began to Talk to me. Solemnly. He Understood my adolescent revolt against everything I had been brought up to cherish and believe. No, more than that, he Respected it. 'Do you know, in a kind of way, I'm proud of you, Porsh? Proud of that fighting spirit. You're pushing against authority and isn't that what I've always taught you to do?'</p> <p>'What?' I screeched. (I have to be honest. There's no other word. It was definitely a screech.)</p> <p>He spread his hands and raised his shoulders with an infernal smugness that will haunt me till the day I die. 'Okay. You've dated the upper-class twit of the year and that's got your dad's attention. You've got Pete listening. Let's talk, yeah?'</p> <p>I mean ...</p> <p>I arose calmly, left the room and went upstairs for a think.</p> <p>Well that's what I should have done but I didn't.</p> <p>In fact I absolutely yelled at him. 'Fuck you, Pete! I hate you! You're pathetic! And you know what else? You're a snob. You're a hideous, contemptible snob!' Then I stamped out of the room, slammed the door and ran upstairs for a cry. The President of the Immortals, in Aeschylean phrase, had finished his sport with Portia.</p> <p>Poo. And more poo.</p> <p>Anyway, at least they know now. Have you told your parents? I suppose they'll hit the roof as well. Their beloved son ensnared by the daughter of Jewish left-wing intellectuals. If you can call a part-time history lecturer at North East London Polytechnic an intellectual, which in my book you can't.</p> <p>It wouldn't be love without opposition, would it? I mean, if Juliet's dad had fallen on Romeo's neck and said, 'I'm not losing a daughter, I'm gaining a son,' and Romeo's mum had beamed 'Welcome to the Montague family, Juliet my precious,' it would be a pretty short play.</p> <p>Anyway, a couple of hours after this 'distressing scene', Pete knocked on my door with a cup of tea. Precision, Portia, precision - he knocked on my door with his knuckles, but you know what I mean. I thought he was going to give me grief, but in fact - well no in fact he did give me grief. That is exactly and literally what he gave me. He had just had a phone call from America. Apparently Pete's brother, my Uncle Leo, had a heart attack in New York last night and was dead by the time an ambulance arrived. Too grim. Uncle Leo's wife Rose died of ovarian cancer in January and now he's gone too. He was forty-eight. Forty-eight and dead from a heart attack. So my poor cousin Gordon is coming over to England to stay with us. He was the one who had to call the ambulance and everything. Imagine seeing your own father die in front of you. He's the only child too. He must be in a terrible state, poor thing. I hope he'll like it with us. I think he was brought up quite orthodox so what he'll make of family life here, I can't imagine. Our idea of kosher is a bacon bagel. I've never met him. I've always pictured him as having a black beard, which is insane of course, since he's about our age. Seventeen going on eighteen, that kind of thing.</p> <p>The result of the day is that peace has broken out in the Fendeman home and next week I shall have a brother to talk to. I'll be able to talk about you.</p> <p>Which, O Neddy mine, is more than you ever do. 'Won a match. Played pretty well I think. Revising hard. Thinking about you a great deal.' I quote the interesting bits.</p> <p>I know you're busy with exams, but then so am I. Don't worry. Any letter that comes from you gives me a fever. I look at the writing and imagine your hand moving over the paper which is enough to make me wriggle like a love-sick eel. I picture your hair flopping down as you write, which is enough to make me writhe and froth like a ... like a ... er, I'll come back to you on that one. I think of your legs under the table and a million trillion cells sparkle and fizz inside me. The way you cross a 't' makes me breathless. I hold the back of my envelope to my lips and think of you licking it and my head swims. I'm a dotty dippy dozy dreadful delirious romantic and I love you to heaven.</p> <p>But I wish wish wish you weren't going back to your school next term. Leave and be free like the rest of us. You don't have to go to Oxford, do you? I wouldn't go to any university that made me stay on through the winter term after I'd already done all my A levels and all my friends had left, just to sit some special entrance paper. How pompous can you get? Why can't they behave like a normal university? Come with me to Bristol. We'll have a much better time.</p> <p>I shan't bully you about it though. You must do whatever you want to do.</p> <p>I love you, I love you, I love you.</p> <p>I've just had a thought. Suppose your History of Art teacher hadn't taken your class on a trip to the Royal Academy that Saturday? Suppose he had taken you to the Tate or the National Gallery instead? You wouldn't have been in Piccadilly and you wouldn't have gone to the Hard Rock Cafe for lunch and I wouldn't be the luckiest, happiest, most dementedly in-love girl in the world.</p> <p>The world is very ... um ... (consults the Thomas Hardy textbook that she's supposed to be studying) ... the world is very contingent.</p> <p>So there.</p> <p>I'm kissing the air around me.</p> <p>Love and love and love and love and love</p> <p>Your Portia X</p> <p>Only one X, because a quintillion wouldn't be anything like enough.</p> <p> 7th June 1980</p> <p> My darling Portia</p> <p>Thank you for a wonderful letter. After your (completely justified) criticism of my terrible style of letter-writing, this is going to be completely tricky.</p> <p>It just seems to gush out of you like a geezer (spelling?) and I'm not too hot at that kind of thing. Also your handwriting is completely perfect (like everything else about you of course) and mine is completely illegible. I thought of responding to your little extra (which was fantastic, by the way) by spraying this envelope with eau de cologne or aftershave, but I haven't got any. I don't suppose the linseed oil I use for my cricket bat would entice you? Thought not.</p> <p>I'm so sorry you had a row with your family. Would it help at all if you were to tell Peter (there, I said it!) that I am completely poor? We never go abroad for holidays, it's all my father can do to send me here and I know that it doesn't sound very left wing or anything but he spends all the rest on travelling between London and his constituency and trying to stop our house from falling down. If I had any brothers or sisters, I'd probably (by the way, where on earth did you get 'prolly' from?) have to wear their hand-me-downs, as it is, I wear his. I'm the only boy in the school who goes around in cavalry twills and old hacking jackets on days when we don't have to wear uniform. I even wear his old boater, which is almost orange with age, and the edge of the brim is chipped. When my mum was alive she genuinely used to darn socks for me, like some old Victorian. So my father may be a fascist (which I honestly don't think he is) but he's a completely poor one. Also, I told him that I met a girl in London and he was very pleased. He didn't hit the roof at all when I said you had a Saturday job from school working as a waitress at a hamburger restaurant. In fact he said it sounded like you had some initiative. And as for the Jewish thing - he was very interested and wondered if your family were refugees from Hitler. He had something to do with the War Crimes in Nuremburg (berg?) and ... oh, anyway I'm not trying to say my father is better than yours - I thought your parents were really nice actually - it's just that you don't have to worry about him disapproving or anything. He can't wait to meet you, and I can't wait for you to meet him. Most people assume he's my grandfather, because he's older than most parents, if you know what I mean. He is a very good man I think, but I know I'm completely biased. Anyway, he's all I have. My mother died when I was born. Didn't I tell you before? My fault really. I was her first one and she was nearly fifty.</p> <p>What terrible news about your uncle in America. I'm so sorry. I hope Gordon turns out to be a nice bloke. It'll be great for you to have a brother at last. All my cousins are completely scary.</p> <p>I just cannot wait for term to end. Thank God the last exam is over. I've been revising so hard that my head is bleeding, but I still don't think I've done as well as I need to.</p> <p>Boring school gossip, Number One: I've been made Head Boy.</p> <p>Ta-ra!</p> <p>We call it 'Captain of School' actually. Just for next term but I'll be too busy revising for Oxford entrance for it to mean much. (More on that subject in a bit.) Anyway, by the time you get to my age all the glamour goes out of authority. It just becomes hard work and endless meetings with the headmaster and school monitors - we call prefects Monitors here, don't ask me why.</p> <p>Number Two: the Sailing Club is going to the west coast of Scotland this August. The master in charge has invited me along. For two weeks: the very same two weeks you and your family are going to Italy, so it's the same two weeks we would have been away from each other anyway. For the rest of the time I'll be staying in my father's flat in Victoria and you'll be there with me as much as possible I hope! Are you going to get a job at the Hard Rock again?</p> <p>Anyway. Oxford. I can't bear either that I've got to come back here in September while you'll be as free as a bird. For two pins I'd forget the whole thing and apply to Bristol and be with you. It's not that I'm really so stuck on Oxford, it's just that I know it would break my father's heart if I didn't go. His great-great-grandfather was at St Mark's and every Maddstone since. There's even a quad named after us. You might think that would make it easier for me to get in, but actually it doesn't work like that any more. I'll actually have to do better in my entrance exam than virtually anyone, just to prove that I've got in on merit not on family name and connections. It would mean so much to him. I hope that doesn't sound chronically pathetic. I'm his only son and I just know how much he'd love coming to visit me and walking round the colleges and pointing out his old haunts and so on.</p> <p>I wish you could come and visit me here. Suppose next term I smuggle you in as a new boy? All you've got to do is squeak and look pretty, and you're very good at that. No, not pretty - you're beautiful of course. The most beautiful thing I've ever seen or ever will see. (You are very good at squeaking though.)</p> <p>I love your letters. I still can't believe all this is true. Has it really happened to us? Other boys here have girlfriends too but I'm certain it's not the same for them. They show their letters around and make a great show of drooling publicly over them. That must be a sign that it's really no more than a joke to them. And it isn't a joke for us, is it?</p> <p>You mention that strange thing about Fate and how it was that our school group was at the Royal Academy and how, if we hadn't been, we probably wouldn't have gone into the Hard Rock Caf*. That is such a completely weird thought. But then, when you came up to our table there were, I think, seven of us and why was it you looked twice at me? Apart from the fact that I'm such a moron that I was standing up. I really hate to disillusion you on that, by the way, but it wasn't politeness that made me stand up. I saw you and I stood up. It was like a sort of instinct. This must sound completely crazy - it was as if I had known you for ever. What's more, if I think about it, I could swear that I knew you were going to come out of that swing door. I had been feeling funny all day. Feeling different if you know what I mean, and by the time we got into the restaurant after sweating around the gallery for two hours and walking half a mile down Piccadilly I just knew something was going to happen to me. And when you started coming towards us (you patted the front of your apron and checked your ear for a pencil in the funniest way - I can remember every detail of it) I just leapt to my feet. I nearly shouted out, 'At last!' and then you looked up into my eyes and we smiled at each other and that was it.</p> <p>But you must have noticed the other boys there. Most of them surely taller and better looking than me? Ashley Barson-Garland was there, who's twenty times funnier and twenty times brainier.</p> <p>That reminds me ... I did something completely awful this morning, in Biology. It's a bit complicated to describe and I feel awful about it. It's not something for you to worry about, but it was odd. I read Barson-Garland's diary. Part of it. I've never done anything like that before and I just don't know what came over me. I'll tell you all about it when we meet.</p> <p> When we meet.</p> <p>When we meet.</p> <p>When we meet.</p> <p>I just CANNOT stop thinking about you. All kinds of wicked things start happening to me.</p> <p>Before I was born my father was a District Commissioner in the Sudan. I remember him telling me once that young men arriving from Britain used to go about in ironed khaki shorts and sometimes, if they happened across one of the beautiful Nubian women who went around bare-topped, or often entirely bare, they would have to turn and face the wall or just sit down on the ground there and then, where they were, to cover the fact, as my father puts it, 'that they had become a little excited downstairs.' Well, just imagining you reading this letter, just knowing that these words will soon be in your eyes, that gets me a little excited downstairs. A lot excited downstairs.</p> <p>So when I say that I'm thinking of you and thinking hard, you'll know what I mean. Well, I've gone and made myself blush now. I adore you so much that I hardly know what to do with myself except laugh.</p> <p>I love you to the power of everything, plus one. </p> <p>Ned X <br> <br></p> <p>Ned never knew why he had done such a sly and terrible thing. Perhaps it was Fate, perhaps it was the Devil, in whom he believed sincerely. </p> <p>He had slipped the book from Ashley Barson-Garland's bag, dropped it onto his knees and opened the first page before he was even aware of what he was doing. His right hand lay on the desk and pretended every now and then to slide backwards and forwards through Advanced Cell Biology. </p> <p>Lowering his eyes to his lap, he began to read.</p> <p>It was a diary. He did not know what else he had imagined it might be. It looked at least four years old. He believed that it was its age that had first attracted him to it when he had seen it peeping from the bag. He had seen Ashley carry this book with him everywhere and that had intrigued him.</p> <p>None the less it was very strange that he should have done such a thing. Ned did not like to think of himself as the kind of person who was interested in other people's diaries.</p> <p>It was difficult to read. Not the handwriting, which was very small, but clear and strong: Barson-Garland's style was - how should one put it? - opaque. Yes, that was an intellectual's word. The style was opaque. </p> <p>With each line that Ned absorbed, the drowsy buzz of the classroom fell further and further away into the background, until he was entirely alone with the words and a vein that throbbed quick and guilty in his neck. </p> <p><br> <br> 3rd May 1978<br></p> <p>Didsbury<br></p> <p> Firstly, it has to be the accent. If you get that right, you're close to them. You're halfway there. Not just the accent, mind, the whole delivery. Note the way the voice comes out of the mouth, note too the mouth's limited aperture, the line of the lips, the angle of the head, the dipping of the head, the tilting of the head, the movement of the hands (hands, not arms, they are not Italians after all) and the direction of gaze.</p> <p>Remember how there used to come a hot buzz of blood to your face on the bus every time you heard your name spoken by them? You believed for one heart-jump of a moment as they repeated and repeated your name that they were talking about you. You truly believed that inexplicably they must know you. They had recognised you as one of their own, displaced by some tragic turn of fate. The very first time on the bus, do you remember, they kept mentioning your name? Maybe you were going to be friends. How excited you were! They saw it in you. That thing you have. They spotted it. That indefinable quality of difference.</p> <p>Then you twigged. It wasn't you they were talking about. They had no idea you existed. Theirs was another Ashley altogether. An amusing Ashley ...</p> <p>That's SAY funny, Ashley.</p> <p>Ashley, that's a RAIL hoot.</p> <p>Despite the initial bump of disappointment that had jolted you like an electric shock when you realised it wasn't you they were talking about, it still gave you a little glow of pride and connection. Made you walk with a bit of a swing for a day or so, didn't it? Maybe your name, the name you hated so much, the name that shamed you, that you had believed to be so middle class, maybe, if one of them shared it with you, maybe it was an all right name after all. Could it be that 'Ashley' was, in fact, upper middle class, or even - you never know - aristocratic?</p> <p>Which one of them was Ashley, though? It was absurd, but you caught the name bandied so often that for a shining day or two you wondered whether they could all be Ashleys. Then you considered the possibility that Ashley might be a general name they used for 'friend', their counterpart of the ugly 'mate' that you heard every day in your concrete playground, just streets away from their stone quadrangle? But then you twigged again.</p> <p>There was no Ashley. Ashley did not exist. There was only an actually.</p> <p>That's so funny, actually. Actually, that's a real hoot.</p> <p>Can you actually, can you actually, Ashley, have ever really believed that they might have been talking about you? Did you seriously think that their lazy glances might actually, Ashley, have so much as taken you in? Sometimes your face may have been in the way of the arc of their gaze, but could you have truly believed that your identity, or even your face, ever actually, Ashley, registered?</p> <p>Yet they registered on you. Oh, how they registered. You looked at their skin and their hair and wondered how it could be so different from our skin and hair. From ordinary people's skin and hair. Was it a genetic gift? You noted the signature patch of flush on their cheeks, a hot scarlet, brighter by far than the dusty crimson bruise that stained the cheeks of the boys at your school. You noted too, on some, such pallor and translucence of complexion that you wondered if it might be their diet. Or the diets of their mothers while they still swam in the womb.</p> <p>What burned into your mind most deeply of all of course, was the Flag. The Flag of the Blest. Their Flag. The flop. The flopping fringe. The fringe that flopped. The Flop Fringe Flag. And how it made you ache. What a great hole grew inside you when you gazed upon the Flag. Like a Frenchman, far from home, catching a whiff of Gauloise. Like an Englishman lost in Asia to whose ears there suddenly floats the opening music of The Archers.</p> <p>Because always, deep down, you did feel that their flag was really your flag too. If it weren't for the terrible mistake. And the hole that grew in you, the great ache you felt was not envy, or covetousness. Actually, Ashley, it was loss, it was exile. You had been banished from your own, all on account of the Terrible Mistake.</p> <p>And you only ever shared a bus with them, what, five times? Six at most. You watched them climbing aboard and swinging themselves to the back seat, sometimes a hand would push down on your headrest and the proximity of that hand to your head would send you dizzy and you would try to eat the air around you, so deep was your hunger for what they were. For what they had. Breaking rules, probably. Skipping into London out of school uniform. The beautiful, the ridiculous uniform of tail coats and striped trousers discarded in favour of sweaters and cords. The Flag flying, free to flop without constriction from boaters and top hats.</p> <p>On the last day, the day before the Move North, you retrieved a boater from under the seat, didn't you? He didn't realise at first that he had come onto the bus wearing it. They teased him and laughing he had skimmed it down towards the driver in mock self-disgust. You nearly opened your mouth to tell him it was lodged under the seat in front of you as he passed on his way out, but you kept silent. Ashamed of your North London vowels. You retrieved the boater and you kept it. A shallow straw hat with a ribbon of blue. And afterwards you wore it, didn't you? In your bedroom. You're wearing it now. You are wearing it now, aren't you, you cheap, you creepy, you sad ... And it doesn't work, does it? Your hair is too coarse to flop like a wild Tay salmon or a swatch of Savile Row suiting, your hair bristles, like a bog brush, like a suburban doormat. In fact, you aren't wearing J. H. G. Etheridge's boater (note the three initials ... class), J. H. G. Etheridge's boater just happens to be On Your Head. Just as this diary is On The Table and this table is On The Floor. The floor isn't wearing the table, the table isn't wearing the diary. There's a gulf, a great gaping gulf of difference. And it is this gulf, this gulf that ... that's why so often you jerk off into this straw hat, isn't it? Isn't it, you miserable lump of nothing?</p>",

      "bodyText": "It all began some time in the last century, in an age when lovers wrote letters to each other sealed up in envelopes. Sometimes they used coloured inks to show their love, or they perfumed their writing-paper with scent. 41 Plough Lane, Hampstead, London NW3 Monday, June 2nd 1980 Darling Ned - I'm sorry about the smell. I hope you've opened this somewhere private, all on your own. You'll get teased to distraction otherwise. It's called Rive Gauche, so I'm feeling like Simone de Beauvoir and I hope you're feeling like Jean-Paul Sartre. Actually I hope you aren't because I think he was pretty horrid to her. I'm writing this upstairs after a row with Pete and Hillary. Ha, ha, ha! Pete and Hillary, Pete and Hillary, Pete and Hillary. You hate it when I call them that, don't you? I love you so much. If you saw my diary you'd die. I wrote a whole two pages this morning. I drew up a list of everything that's wonderful and glorious about you and one day when we're together for ever I might let you look at it and you'll die again. I wrote that you're old-fashioned. One: the first time we met you stood up when I entered the room, which was sweet, but it was the Hard Rock Cafe and I was coming out of the kitchen to take your order. Two: every time I refer to my mum and dad as Peter and Hillary, you go pink and tighten your lips. Three: when you first talked to Pete and ... all right, I'll let you off - when you first talked to Mum and Dad, you let them go on and on about private education and private health and how terrible it was and how evil the government is and you never said a word. About your dad being a Tory MP, I mean. You talked beautifully about the weather and incomprehensibly about cricket. But you never let on. That's what the row today was about, in fact. Your dad was on Weekend World at lunchtime, you prolly saw him. (I love you, by the way. God, I love you so much.) 'Where do they find them?' barked Pete, stabbing a finger at the television. 'Where do they find them?' 'Find who?' I said coldly, gearing up for a fight. 'Whom,' said Hillary. 'These tweed-jacketed throwbacks,' said Pete. 'Look at the old fart. What right has he got to talk about the miners? He wouldn't recognise a lump of coal if it fell into his bowl of Brown Windsor soup.' 'You remember the boy I brought home last week?' I said, with what I'm pretty sure any observer would call icy calm. 'Job security he says!' Peter yelled at the screen. 'When have you ever had to worry about job security, Mr Eton, Oxford and the Guards?' Then he turned to me. 'Hm? What boy? When?' He always does that when you ask him a question - says something else first, completely off the subject, and then answers your question with one (or more) of his own. Drives me mad. (So do you, darling Neddy. But mad with deepest love.) If you were to say to my father, 'Pete, what year was the battle of Hastings?' he'd say, 'They're cutting back on unemployment benefit. In real terms it's gone down by 5% in just two years. 5%. Bastards. Hastings? Why do you want to know? Why Hastings? Hastings was nothing but a clash between warlords and robber barons. The only battle worth knowing about is the battle between ...' and he'd be off. He knows it drives me mad. I think it prolly drives Hillary mad too. Anyway, I persevered. 'The boy I brought home,' I said. 'His name was Ned. You remember him perfectly well. It was his half term. He came into the Hard Rock two weeks ago.' 'The Sloane Ranger in the cricket jumper, what about him?' 'He is not a Sloane Ranger!' 'Looked like one to me. Didn't he look like a Sloane Ranger to you, Hills?' 'He was certainly very polite,' Hillary said. 'Exactly.' Pete returned to the bloody TV where there was a shot of your dad trying to address a group of Yorkshire miners, which I have to admit was quite funny. 'Look at that! First time the old fascist has ever been north of Watford in his life, I guarantee you. Except when he's passing through on his way to Scotland to murder grouse. Unbelievable. Unbelievable.' 'Never mind Watford, when did you last go north of Hampstead?' I said. Well, shouted. Which was fair I think, because he was driving me mad and he can be such a hypocrite sometimes. Hillary went all don't-you-talk-to-your-father-like-that-ish and then got back to her article. She's doing a new column now, for Spare Rib, and gets ratty very easily. 'You seem to have forgotten that I took my doctorate at Sheffield University,' Pete said, as if that qualified him for the Northerner of the Decade Award. 'Never mind that,' I went on. 'The point is Ned just happens to be that man's son.' And I pointed at the screen with a very exultant finger. Unfortunately the man on camera just at that moment was the presenter. Pete turned to me with a look of awe. 'That boy is Brian Walden's son?' he said hoarsely. 'You're going out with Brian Walden's son?' It seems that Brian Walden, the presenter, used to be a Labour MP. For one moment Pete had this picture of me stepping out with socialist royalty. I could see his brain rapidly trying to calculate the chances of his worming his way into Brian Walden's confidence (father-in-law to father-in-law) wangling a seat in the next election and progressing triumphantly from the dull grind of the Inner London Education Authority to the thrill and glamour of the House of Commons and national fame. Peter Fendeman, maverick firebrand and hero of the workers, I watched the whole fantasy pass through his greedy eyes. Disgusting. 'Not him!' I said. 'Him!' Your father had appeared back on screen again, now striding towards the door of Number Ten with papers tucked under his arm. I love you, Ned. I love you more than the tides love the moon. More than Mickey loves Minnie and Pooh loves honey. I love your big dark eyes and your sweet round bum. I love your mess of hair and your very red lips. They are very red in fact, I bet you didn't know that. Very few people have lips that really are red in the way that poets write about red. Yours are the reddest red, a redder red than ever I read of, and I want them all over me right now - but oh, no matter how red your lips, how round your bum, how big your eyes, it's you that I love. When I saw you standing there at Table Sixteen, smiling at me, it was as if you were entirely without a body at all. I had come out of the kitchen in a foul mood and there shining in front of me I saw this soul. This Ned. This you. A naked soul smiling at me like the sun and I knew I would die if I didn't spend the rest of my life with it. But still, how I wished this afternoon that your father were a union leader, a teacher in a comprehensive school, the editor of the Morning Star, Brian Walden himself - anything but Charles Maddstone, war hero, retired Brigadier of the Guards, ex colonial administrator. Most of all, how I wish he was anything but a cabinet minister in a Conservative government. That's not right though, is it? You wouldn't be you then, would you? When Pete and Hillary both got it, they stared from me to the screen and back again. Hillary even looked at the chair you sat in the day you came round. Glared at the thing as if she wanted it disinfected and burned. 'Oh, Portia!' she said in what they used to call 'tragic accents'. Pete, of course, after going as red as Lenin, swallowed his rage and his baffled pride and began to Talk to me. Solemnly. He Understood my adolescent revolt against everything I had been brought up to cherish and believe. No, more than that, he Respected it. 'Do you know, in a kind of way, I'm proud of you, Porsh? Proud of that fighting spirit. You're pushing against authority and isn't that what I've always taught you to do?' 'What?' I screeched. (I have to be honest. There's no other word. It was definitely a screech.) He spread his hands and raised his shoulders with an infernal smugness that will haunt me till the day I die. 'Okay. You've dated the upper-class twit of the year and that's got your dad's attention. You've got Pete listening. Let's talk, yeah?' I mean ... I arose calmly, left the room and went upstairs for a think. Well that's what I should have done but I didn't. In fact I absolutely yelled at him. 'Fuck you, Pete! I hate you! You're pathetic! And you know what else? You're a snob. You're a hideous, contemptible snob!' Then I stamped out of the room, slammed the door and ran upstairs for a cry. The President of the Immortals, in Aeschylean phrase, had finished his sport with Portia. Poo. And more poo. Anyway, at least they know now. Have you told your parents? I suppose they'll hit the roof as well. Their beloved son ensnared by the daughter of Jewish left-wing intellectuals. If you can call a part-time history lecturer at North East London Polytechnic an intellectual, which in my book you can't. It wouldn't be love without opposition, would it? I mean, if Juliet's dad had fallen on Romeo's neck and said, 'I'm not losing a daughter, I'm gaining a son,' and Romeo's mum had beamed 'Welcome to the Montague family, Juliet my precious,' it would be a pretty short play. Anyway, a couple of hours after this 'distressing scene', Pete knocked on my door with a cup of tea. Precision, Portia, precision - he knocked on my door with his knuckles, but you know what I mean. I thought he was going to give me grief, but in fact - well no in fact he did give me grief. That is exactly and literally what he gave me. He had just had a phone call from America. Apparently Pete's brother, my Uncle Leo, had a heart attack in New York last night and was dead by the time an ambulance arrived. Too grim. Uncle Leo's wife Rose died of ovarian cancer in January and now he's gone too. He was forty-eight. Forty-eight and dead from a heart attack. So my poor cousin Gordon is coming over to England to stay with us. He was the one who had to call the ambulance and everything. Imagine seeing your own father die in front of you. He's the only child too. He must be in a terrible state, poor thing. I hope he'll like it with us. I think he was brought up quite orthodox so what he'll make of family life here, I can't imagine. Our idea of kosher is a bacon bagel. I've never met him. I've always pictured him as having a black beard, which is insane of course, since he's about our age. Seventeen going on eighteen, that kind of thing. The result of the day is that peace has broken out in the Fendeman home and next week I shall have a brother to talk to. I'll be able to talk about you. Which, O Neddy mine, is more than you ever do. 'Won a match. Played pretty well I think. Revising hard. Thinking about you a great deal.' I quote the interesting bits. I know you're busy with exams, but then so am I. Don't worry. Any letter that comes from you gives me a fever. I look at the writing and imagine your hand moving over the paper which is enough to make me wriggle like a love-sick eel. I picture your hair flopping down as you write, which is enough to make me writhe and froth like a ... like a ... er, I'll come back to you on that one. I think of your legs under the table and a million trillion cells sparkle and fizz inside me. The way you cross a 't' makes me breathless. I hold the back of my envelope to my lips and think of you licking it and my head swims. I'm a dotty dippy dozy dreadful delirious romantic and I love you to heaven. But I wish wish wish you weren't going back to your school next term. Leave and be free like the rest of us. You don't have to go to Oxford, do you? I wouldn't go to any university that made me stay on through the winter term after I'd already done all my A levels and all my friends had left, just to sit some special entrance paper. How pompous can you get? Why can't they behave like a normal university? Come with me to Bristol. We'll have a much better time. I shan't bully you about it though. You must do whatever you want to do. I love you, I love you, I love you. I've just had a thought. Suppose your History of Art teacher hadn't taken your class on a trip to the Royal Academy that Saturday? Suppose he had taken you to the Tate or the National Gallery instead? You wouldn't have been in Piccadilly and you wouldn't have gone to the Hard Rock Cafe for lunch and I wouldn't be the luckiest, happiest, most dementedly in-love girl in the world. The world is very ... um ... (consults the Thomas Hardy textbook that she's supposed to be studying) ... the world is very contingent. So there. I'm kissing the air around me. Love and love and love and love and love Your Portia X Only one X, because a quintillion wouldn't be anything like enough. 7th June 1980 My darling Portia Thank you for a wonderful letter. After your (completely justified) criticism of my terrible style of letter-writing, this is going to be completely tricky. It just seems to gush out of you like a geezer (spelling?) and I'm not too hot at that kind of thing. Also your handwriting is completely perfect (like everything else about you of course) and mine is completely illegible. I thought of responding to your little extra (which was fantastic, by the way) by spraying this envelope with eau de cologne or aftershave, but I haven't got any. I don't suppose the linseed oil I use for my cricket bat would entice you? Thought not. I'm so sorry you had a row with your family. Would it help at all if you were to tell Peter (there, I said it!) that I am completely poor? We never go abroad for holidays, it's all my father can do to send me here and I know that it doesn't sound very left wing or anything but he spends all the rest on travelling between London and his constituency and trying to stop our house from falling down. If I had any brothers or sisters, I'd probably (by the way, where on earth did you get 'prolly' from?) have to wear their hand-me-downs, as it is, I wear his. I'm the only boy in the school who goes around in cavalry twills and old hacking jackets on days when we don't have to wear uniform. I even wear his old boater, which is almost orange with age, and the edge of the brim is chipped. When my mum was alive she genuinely used to darn socks for me, like some old Victorian. So my father may be a fascist (which I honestly don't think he is) but he's a completely poor one. Also, I told him that I met a girl in London and he was very pleased. He didn't hit the roof at all when I said you had a Saturday job from school working as a waitress at a hamburger restaurant. In fact he said it sounded like you had some initiative. And as for the Jewish thing - he was very interested and wondered if your family were refugees from Hitler. He had something to do with the War Crimes in Nuremburg (berg?) and ... oh, anyway I'm not trying to say my father is better than yours - I thought your parents were really nice actually - it's just that you don't have to worry about him disapproving or anything. He can't wait to meet you, and I can't wait for you to meet him. Most people assume he's my grandfather, because he's older than most parents, if you know what I mean. He is a very good man I think, but I know I'm completely biased. Anyway, he's all I have. My mother died when I was born. Didn't I tell you before? My fault really. I was her first one and she was nearly fifty. What terrible news about your uncle in America. I'm so sorry. I hope Gordon turns out to be a nice bloke. It'll be great for you to have a brother at last. All my cousins are completely scary. I just cannot wait for term to end. Thank God the last exam is over. I've been revising so hard that my head is bleeding, but I still don't think I've done as well as I need to. Boring school gossip, Number One: I've been made Head Boy. Ta-ra! We call it 'Captain of School' actually. Just for next term but I'll be too busy revising for Oxford entrance for it to mean much. (More on that subject in a bit.) Anyway, by the time you get to my age all the glamour goes out of authority. It just becomes hard work and endless meetings with the headmaster and school monitors - we call prefects Monitors here, don't ask me why. Number Two: the Sailing Club is going to the west coast of Scotland this August. The master in charge has invited me along. For two weeks: the very same two weeks you and your family are going to Italy, so it's the same two weeks we would have been away from each other anyway. For the rest of the time I'll be staying in my father's flat in Victoria and you'll be there with me as much as possible I hope! Are you going to get a job at the Hard Rock again? Anyway. Oxford. I can't bear either that I've got to come back here in September while you'll be as free as a bird. For two pins I'd forget the whole thing and apply to Bristol and be with you. It's not that I'm really so stuck on Oxford, it's just that I know it would break my father's heart if I didn't go. His great-great-grandfather was at St Mark's and every Maddstone since. There's even a quad named after us. You might think that would make it easier for me to get in, but actually it doesn't work like that any more. I'll actually have to do better in my entrance exam than virtually anyone, just to prove that I've got in on merit not on family name and connections. It would mean so much to him. I hope that doesn't sound chronically pathetic. I'm his only son and I just know how much he'd love coming to visit me and walking round the colleges and pointing out his old haunts and so on. I wish you could come and visit me here. Suppose next term I smuggle you in as a new boy? All you've got to do is squeak and look pretty, and you're very good at that. No, not pretty - you're beautiful of course. The most beautiful thing I've ever seen or ever will see. (You are very good at squeaking though.) I love your letters. I still can't believe all this is true. Has it really happened to us? Other boys here have girlfriends too but I'm certain it's not the same for them. They show their letters around and make a great show of drooling publicly over them. That must be a sign that it's really no more than a joke to them. And it isn't a joke for us, is it? You mention that strange thing about Fate and how it was that our school group was at the Royal Academy and how, if we hadn't been, we probably wouldn't have gone into the Hard Rock Caf*. That is such a completely weird thought. But then, when you came up to our table there were, I think, seven of us and why was it you looked twice at me? Apart from the fact that I'm such a moron that I was standing up. I really hate to disillusion you on that, by the way, but it wasn't politeness that made me stand up. I saw you and I stood up. It was like a sort of instinct. This must sound completely crazy - it was as if I had known you for ever. What's more, if I think about it, I could swear that I knew you were going to come out of that swing door. I had been feeling funny all day. Feeling different if you know what I mean, and by the time we got into the restaurant after sweating around the gallery for two hours and walking half a mile down Piccadilly I just knew something was going to happen to me. And when you started coming towards us (you patted the front of your apron and checked your ear for a pencil in the funniest way - I can remember every detail of it) I just leapt to my feet. I nearly shouted out, 'At last!' and then you looked up into my eyes and we smiled at each other and that was it. But you must have noticed the other boys there. Most of them surely taller and better looking than me? Ashley Barson-Garland was there, who's twenty times funnier and twenty times brainier. That reminds me ... I did something completely awful this morning, in Biology. It's a bit complicated to describe and I feel awful about it. It's not something for you to worry about, but it was odd. I read Barson-Garland's diary. Part of it. I've never done anything like that before and I just don't know what came over me. I'll tell you all about it when we meet. When we meet. When we meet. When we meet. I just CANNOT stop thinking about you. All kinds of wicked things start happening to me. Before I was born my father was a District Commissioner in the Sudan. I remember him telling me once that young men arriving from Britain used to go about in ironed khaki shorts and sometimes, if they happened across one of the beautiful Nubian women who went around bare-topped, or often entirely bare, they would have to turn and face the wall or just sit down on the ground there and then, where they were, to cover the fact, as my father puts it, 'that they had become a little excited downstairs.' Well, just imagining you reading this letter, just knowing that these words will soon be in your eyes, that gets me a little excited downstairs. A lot excited downstairs. So when I say that I'm thinking of you and thinking hard, you'll know what I mean. Well, I've gone and made myself blush now. I adore you so much that I hardly know what to do with myself except laugh. I love you to the power of everything, plus one. Ned X Ned never knew why he had done such a sly and terrible thing. Perhaps it was Fate, perhaps it was the Devil, in whom he believed sincerely. He had slipped the book from Ashley Barson-Garland's bag, dropped it onto his knees and opened the first page before he was even aware of what he was doing. His right hand lay on the desk and pretended every now and then to slide backwards and forwards through Advanced Cell Biology. Lowering his eyes to his lap, he began to read. It was a diary. He did not know what else he had imagined it might be. It looked at least four years old. He believed that it was its age that had first attracted him to it when he had seen it peeping from the bag. He had seen Ashley carry this book with him everywhere and that had intrigued him. None the less it was very strange that he should have done such a thing. Ned did not like to think of himself as the kind of person who was interested in other people's diaries. It was difficult to read. Not the handwriting, which was very small, but clear and strong: Barson-Garland's style was - how should one put it? - opaque. Yes, that was an intellectual's word. The style was opaque. With each line that Ned absorbed, the drowsy buzz of the classroom fell further and further away into the background, until he was entirely alone with the words and a vein that throbbed quick and guilty in his neck. 3rd May 1978 Didsbury Firstly, it has to be the accent. If you get that right, you're close to them. You're halfway there. Not just the accent, mind, the whole delivery. Note the way the voice comes out of the mouth, note too the mouth's limited aperture, the line of the lips, the angle of the head, the dipping of the head, the tilting of the head, the movement of the hands (hands, not arms, they are not Italians after all) and the direction of gaze. Remember how there used to come a hot buzz of blood to your face on the bus every time you heard your name spoken by them? You believed for one heart-jump of a moment as they repeated and repeated your name that they were talking about you. You truly believed that inexplicably they must know you. They had recognised you as one of their own, displaced by some tragic turn of fate. The very first time on the bus, do you remember, they kept mentioning your name? Maybe you were going to be friends. How excited you were! They saw it in you. That thing you have. They spotted it. That indefinable quality of difference. Then you twigged. It wasn't you they were talking about. They had no idea you existed. Theirs was another Ashley altogether. An amusing Ashley ... That's SAY funny, Ashley. Ashley, that's a RAIL hoot. Despite the initial bump of disappointment that had jolted you like an electric shock when you realised it wasn't you they were talking about, it still gave you a little glow of pride and connection. Made you walk with a bit of a swing for a day or so, didn't it? Maybe your name, the name you hated so much, the name that shamed you, that you had believed to be so middle class, maybe, if one of them shared it with you, maybe it was an all right name after all. Could it be that 'Ashley' was, in fact, upper middle class, or even - you never know - aristocratic? Which one of them was Ashley, though? It was absurd, but you caught the name bandied so often that for a shining day or two you wondered whether they could all be Ashleys. Then you considered the possibility that Ashley might be a general name they used for 'friend', their counterpart of the ugly 'mate' that you heard every day in your concrete playground, just streets away from their stone quadrangle? But then you twigged again. There was no Ashley. Ashley did not exist. There was only an actually. That's so funny, actually. Actually, that's a real hoot. Can you actually, can you actually, Ashley, have ever really believed that they might have been talking about you? Did you seriously think that their lazy glances might actually, Ashley, have so much as taken you in? Sometimes your face may have been in the way of the arc of their gaze, but could you have truly believed that your identity, or even your face, ever actually, Ashley, registered? Yet they registered on you. Oh, how they registered. You looked at their skin and their hair and wondered how it could be so different from our skin and hair. From ordinary people's skin and hair. Was it a genetic gift? You noted the signature patch of flush on their cheeks, a hot scarlet, brighter by far than the dusty crimson bruise that stained the cheeks of the boys at your school. You noted too, on some, such pallor and translucence of complexion that you wondered if it might be their diet. Or the diets of their mothers while they still swam in the womb. What burned into your mind most deeply of all of course, was the Flag. The Flag of the Blest. Their Flag. The flop. The flopping fringe. The fringe that flopped. The Flop Fringe Flag. And how it made you ache. What a great hole grew inside you when you gazed upon the Flag. Like a Frenchman, far from home, catching a whiff of Gauloise. Like an Englishman lost in Asia to whose ears there suddenly floats the opening music of The Archers. Because always, deep down, you did feel that their flag was really your flag too. If it weren't for the terrible mistake. And the hole that grew in you, the great ache you felt was not envy, or covetousness. Actually, Ashley, it was loss, it was exile. You had been banished from your own, all on account of the Terrible Mistake. And you only ever shared a bus with them, what, five times? Six at most. You watched them climbing aboard and swinging themselves to the back seat, sometimes a hand would push down on your headrest and the proximity of that hand to your head would send you dizzy and you would try to eat the air around you, so deep was your hunger for what they were. For what they had. Breaking rules, probably. Skipping into London out of school uniform. The beautiful, the ridiculous uniform of tail coats and striped trousers discarded in favour of sweaters and cords. The Flag flying, free to flop without constriction from boaters and top hats. On the last day, the day before the Move North, you retrieved a boater from under the seat, didn't you? He didn't realise at first that he had come onto the bus wearing it. They teased him and laughing he had skimmed it down towards the driver in mock self-disgust. You nearly opened your mouth to tell him it was lodged under the seat in front of you as he passed on his way out, but you kept silent. Ashamed of your North London vowels. You retrieved the boater and you kept it. A shallow straw hat with a ribbon of blue. And afterwards you wore it, didn't you? In your bedroom. You're wearing it now. You are wearing it now, aren't you, you cheap, you creepy, you sad ... And it doesn't work, does it? Your hair is too coarse to flop like a wild Tay salmon or a swatch of Savile Row suiting, your hair bristles, like a bog brush, like a suburban doormat. In fact, you aren't wearing J. H. G. Etheridge's boater (note the three initials ... class), J. H. G. Etheridge's boater just happens to be On Your Head. Just as this diary is On The Table and this table is On The Floor. The floor isn't wearing the table, the table isn't wearing the diary. There's a gulf, a great gaping gulf of difference. And it is this gulf, this gulf that ... that's why so often you jerk off into this straw hat, isn't it? Isn't it, you miserable lump of nothing?",

      "bodyText": "Neil Kinnock, a politician who engagingly wears his heart on his sleeve, was sounding unusually ratty this week when he complained that sections of the British media were peddling \"bilge\" about the European Union to their readers. Fulminating on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the former Labour leader protested that, by running stories that simply weren't true, newspapers were contributing to \"bewilderment and antagonism\" over Europe. There's certainly plenty of that about, with a recent Eurobarometer poll again showing Britons at the very bottom of the class for understanding the EU. But was his criticism valid? Happily, the commission vice-president wasn't talking about the Guardian. We try to report the EU like we report everything else: straight, but deep. Comment, of course, is free, and a lot of ours is unashamedly pro-European. But if it's not too precious to say that the facts are sacred, we certainly make every effort - in Brussels as in London - to respect them. And that includes not treating them selectively. In any event, it was hard to disagree with the Welsh wizard on this specific complaint. Several Sunday newspapers had run a story about how the European Commission was planning to replace the burgundy passport that is now common to all member states, but is differentiated by their own national symbols (the royal coat of arms in Britain's case). This was going to be usurped by a uniform blue one emblazoned with the 12 gold stars of the union. It wasn't a bad tale and the accompanying graphics were, well, graphic. Except that the essential point wasn't true: it only took a quick phone call to find out that all that had been discussed was the need for improvements in identity documents to prevent fraud, with Home Affairs commissioner Antonio Vitorino proposing to address the issue at a forthcoming meeting. What was correct was that the idea of a common European passport had been around for years, though without ever getting very far. So here was a depressingly familiar example of the classic Brussels horror story: picking up a theme that points in an integrationist direction and following it through to its logical conclusion by the addition of an ostensibly dramatic new detail. On the Euro-myth scales, the idea of blue passports wasn't anywhere near as silly as old favourites like straight cucumbers, square tomatoes, a ban on ladders or the requirement that dead pets be pressure-cooked to avoid spreading BSE. But it still wasn't true. Thus Kinnock's intemperate tone. Not, of course, that the commission doesn't harbour all sorts of far-reaching ambitions: that's its job as the embodiment of the supranational bit of the EU, where governments have uniquely agreed to pool their sovereignty. Its declared mission in life is to go further in pursuit of the goal of \"ever closer union\". And if anyone had forgotten that, Romano Prodi, its president and Kinnock's boss, reminded them when he made clear a day or so later that he wanted most national vetoes scrapped in the forthcoming Treaty of Nice - earning him the description \"power-mad\" from the Sun, populist keeper of the British eurosceptic flame. Downing Street's reaction was more restrained, observing the unwritten convention that the former Italian prime minister is to be damned with faint interest and little praise. But the fact is that half a dozen other EU countries have their own strong reservations about the sort of things the commission would like to do if left to its own devices - whether reducing use of the veto, making the charter of fundamental rights legally binding, or running a fully-fledged European army autonomous from Nato. In real life, though, the commission is rarely left to its own devices, but rather exists in constant interplay with the member states, and more recently, with a European parliament which now has more powers - and confidence - than ever before. Yet whether the EU's executive is capable of doing more to explain itself better - and avoid the sort of scare stories that delight the Europhobes - is an open question. Brussels boasts the world's largest press corps, but the commission often acts as if simple explanation, never mind sophisticated, agenda-setting spin-doctoring, is beyond its powers. Big speeches are made without advance warning or briefing, while stories leak simply because they serve the interests of individual commissioners. Denials are routinely issued after damaging stories have already appeared. Prodi's shambolic performance has improved a tad in recent weeks, but generally the commission press service is neither proactive nor effective in its handling of the media. The European Union is a complicated story of competing institutions, different agendas, a glacially slow pace and maddeningly treacley consistency. It doesn't fit easily into comic-book caricatures of goodies and baddies, proud and resolute defenders of national sovereignty versus traitorous Europhiles ready to give it away by adopting measures, in the words of Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, that will \"unobtrusively take us down the superstate path.\" Neil Kinnock may have been a bit ill-tempered on air.

      "body": "<p>Craig Native, Colleen Dubane and William Ntamo are all young fashion designers. More than that, they are all young black fashion designers and, unusually for the fashion industry, in their circles this is the norm. Native, Dubane and Ntamo are leading lights in a new wave of fashion talent about to break out of their home market of South Africa and go global. </p> <p>There is little doubt that South Africa is poised to claim its place on the fashion map. Its fifth fashion week, held last month, was the first to attract international press and buyers, as well as major sponsors, including Evian and Ciro Coffee; it was also the first to have an accompanying exhibition, which has government backing to tour Europe. </p> <p>\"There's a push to make up for past wrongs and for companies to sponsor black designers now,\" says Lucilla Booyzen, founder and organiser of South African fashion week. \"The designs themselves are also becoming more international, moving away from limiting ethnic influences. Of course, it will depend on how open the world is to black designers, but I think South Africa is set to deliver amazing things.\" </p> <p>Cultural shifts in the country have been recent and extreme. \"Until last year, there wasn't really any high-profile black culture,\" says Charl Blignaut, editor of South African youth culture e-zine Rage. \"Then came Kwaito, music from the street which mutated from house. That launched a whole galaxy of black stars here and spilled over into other disciplines, too. So for the first time we have young black designers, magazines like Elle South Africa that focus on their work and black fashion editors.\" </p> <p>The expected flood of talented new black designers from South Africa may help counter somewhat stereotyped perceptions of black designers' fashion talents, locked as they have been in a ghetto of the baggy arses and big logos of \"street\", \"urban\" and \"hip-hop\" clothing. It's true that, to date, those few black designers with multi-million-dollar success stories have pioneered this huge market, notably Russell Simmons' Phat Farm label, 30-year-old Carl Williams' Karl Kani line, which last year celebrated its 10th anniversary, and FUBU (For Us By Us), the $350m business run by 28-year-old Daymond John. </p> <p>\"For black designers, there is this problem of stereotyping,\" says William Ntamo, who last month won Elle South Africa's New Designer award. \"The market assumes if you're black, you must be doing streetwear, nothing conceptual or sophisticated.

      "bodyText": "Craig Native, Colleen Dubane and William Ntamo are all young fashion designers. More than that, they are all young black fashion designers and, unusually for the fashion industry, in their circles this is the norm. Native, Dubane and Ntamo are leading lights in a new wave of fashion talent about to break out of their home market of South Africa and go global. There is little doubt that South Africa is poised to claim its place on the fashion map. Its fifth fashion week, held last month, was the first to attract international press and buyers, as well as major sponsors, including Evian and Ciro Coffee; it was also the first to have an accompanying exhibition, which has government backing to tour Europe. \"There's a push to make up for past wrongs and for companies to sponsor black designers now,\" says Lucilla Booyzen, founder and organiser of South African fashion week. \"The designs themselves are also becoming more international, moving away from limiting ethnic influences. Of course, it will depend on how open the world is to black designers, but I think South Africa is set to deliver amazing things.\" Cultural shifts in the country have been recent and extreme. \"Until last year, there wasn't really any high-profile black culture,\" says Charl Blignaut, editor of South African youth culture e-zine Rage. \"Then came Kwaito, music from the street which mutated from house. That launched a whole galaxy of black stars here and spilled over into other disciplines, too. So for the first time we have young black designers, magazines like Elle South Africa that focus on their work and black fashion editors.\" The expected flood of talented new black designers from South Africa may help counter somewhat stereotyped perceptions of black designers' fashion talents, locked as they have been in a ghetto of the baggy arses and big logos of \"street\", \"urban\" and \"hip-hop\" clothing. It's true that, to date, those few black designers with multi-million-dollar success stories have pioneered this huge market, notably Russell Simmons' Phat Farm label, 30-year-old Carl Williams' Karl Kani line, which last year celebrated its 10th anniversary, and FUBU (For Us By Us), the $350m business run by 28-year-old Daymond John. \"For black designers, there is this problem of stereotyping,\" says William Ntamo, who last month won Elle South Africa's New Designer award. \"The market assumes if you're black, you must be doing streetwear, nothing conceptual or sophisticated. But it is changing.\" Craig Native, for instance, has created the rock god wardrobe for Lenny Kravitz's forthcoming world tour, while designers such as Ntamo and Stoned Cherrie lean toward chic, top-end womenswear. \"The more black designers are seen out there,\" Ntamo says, \"the more perceptions will change.\" But the unpalatable truth remains that, on a global level, South African designers still face an uneven playing field.

      "body": "<p>The placards say \"down with the Israeli occupation\" and \"stop the massacres\", but the 60 protesters on a traffic roundabout in Jerusalem are not Palestinians. They are Israelis holding a lunchtime vigil.</p> <p>\"We're here to show a presence,\" says Maurice Lazla, who recently finished at university and now works for a human rights organisation.</p> <p>\"Jerusalem is a right-wing city and it's very important that we don't surrender to fanatics and nationalists.\"</p> <p>The demonstrators mostly describe themselves as radical left. They come from a variety of peace groups, including Gush Shalom and Women in Black.</p> <p>They believe that Israel should pull back to the 1967 border and allow Jerusalem to become the capital of two states: Israeli and Palestinian.</p> <p>\"We're not asking for a compromise,\" says Irit Umanit, one of the Women in Black. \"We want to give back what was not ours in the first place. There is no reason why we can't come to some proper solution.\"</p> <p>During the vigils they get a lot of abuse from passing drivers, most of it sexual, she says. \"Get back to the kitchen - that sort of thing.\"</p> <p>Moments later, a van driver spots her \"evacuate the settlements\" poster and screeches to a halt. \"YOU should be evacuated,\" he shouts. A policeman moves the van on.</p> <p>Support from motorists can be harder to detect. \"Someone smiled at me just now,\" Ms Umanit says, interpreting it as a gesture of solidarity.</p> <p>Six schoolboys in skull caps arrive and a policeman, anticipating trouble, has a word with them. They unfurl their own alternative posters - \"yes to settlements, no to retreat\" - and try to block the peace posters from view.</p> <p>A man sitting nearby is quietly seething about the demonstrators. \"There can never be peace with the Arabs,\" he says. \"Remember Hitler and Munich.\"</p> <p>Adam Keller of Gush Shalom says: \"The strange thing is that, when this outbreak of violence started, there was less hostility than there is now. It may be because at first people felt we could be ignored.\"</p> <p>Most of the demonstrators have done military service, which is compulsory in Israel - three years for men and two for women. The law does not recognise conscientious objection, but religious women can do social service instead.</p> <p>Unlike the United States during the Vietnam war, there is little resistance to military service, and the authorities are careful not to make martyrs of the few who refuse. One objector was jailed for three months but released early.</p> <p>In October, a serving soldier, Noam Kuzar, was sentenced to 28 days in military prison for refusing to take part in action against the Palestinians.</p> <p>He was released last Friday but, speaking to The Guardian on a mobile phone from his barracks, said that he is still waiting to hear about his future in the army.</p> <p>Other radical peace groups in Israel include Yesh Gvul, started by soldiers during the Lebanon war, New Profile, a group seeking to abolish conscription, and the Committee Against House Demolitions, set up two years ago to help Palestinians whose houses are demolished by the army.</p> <p>By far the largest organisation - but less radical - is Peace Now, started 22 years ago in the wake of the Sabra and Chatila massacres in Lebanon. It has, on occasions, mustered demonstrations of more than 200,000 people.</p> <p>Its guiding principle, according to director Gaby Lasky, is \"not to fight wars that are not imposed upon us.</p> <p>\"We want peace negotiations with all Israel's neighbours - it's not a one-border issue,\" she said.</p> <p>Unlike the more radical groups, Peace Now regards the 1967 borders as \"the basis for determining Israel's final borders.\"</p> <p>Peace Now draws its support mainly from the centre-left - the Labour and Meretz parties. This, according to the radicals, has placed its supporters in a dilemma: whether to remain loyal to Labour or to cling to their former peace slogans.</p> <p>Although many continue to back the government, \"we have been very outspoken against a coalition with Sharon [the Likud leader],\" Ms Lasky said.</p> <p>\"In opinion polls, a very high number of people still support the peace process - about 62 per cent. This has strengthened our belief that we have been right.\"</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:brian.whitaker@theguardian.com\"> brian.whitaker@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/israel/0,2759,377264,00.html\">Israel &amp; the Middle East</a><br></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28brian+whitaker%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=brian+whitaker&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by Brian Whitaker</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\" target=\"_new\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\" target=\"_new\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.moledet.org.il/moleng.htm\" target=\"_new\">Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party) <br></a><a href=\"http://www.iris.org.il/\" target=\"_new\">Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3188/\" target=\"_new\">Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.virtual.co.il/orgs/orgs/ichud/irindex.htm\" target=\"_new\">Organisation of Rabbis for the People of Israel</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://wib.matriz.net/jun99/wib007jun99_en.html\" target=\"_new\">Women in Black</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.coopcomm.org/gkh_essay05.htm\" target=\"_new\">Essay about Yesh Gvul and other peace activists</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.gush-shalom.org/\" target=\"_new\">Gush Shalom</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The placards say \"down with the Israeli occupation\" and \"stop the massacres\", but the 60 protesters on a traffic roundabout in Jerusalem are not Palestinians. They are Israelis holding a lunchtime vigil. \"We're here to show a presence,\" says Maurice Lazla, who recently finished at university and now works for a human rights organisation. \"Jerusalem is a right-wing city and it's very important that we don't surrender to fanatics and nationalists.\" The demonstrators mostly describe themselves as radical left. They come from a variety of peace groups, including Gush Shalom and Women in Black. They believe that Israel should pull back to the 1967 border and allow Jerusalem to become the capital of two states: Israeli and Palestinian. \"We're not asking for a compromise,\" says Irit Umanit, one of the Women in Black. \"We want to give back what was not ours in the first place. There is no reason why we can't come to some proper solution.\" During the vigils they get a lot of abuse from passing drivers, most of it sexual, she says. \"Get back to the kitchen - that sort of thing.\" Moments later, a van driver spots her \"evacuate the settlements\" poster and screeches to a halt. \"YOU should be evacuated,\" he shouts. A policeman moves the van on. Support from motorists can be harder to detect. \"Someone smiled at me just now,\" Ms Umanit says, interpreting it as a gesture of solidarity. Six schoolboys in skull caps arrive and a policeman, anticipating trouble, has a word with them. They unfurl their own alternative posters - \"yes to settlements, no to retreat\" - and try to block the peace posters from view. A man sitting nearby is quietly seething about the demonstrators. \"There can never be peace with the Arabs,\" he says. \"Remember Hitler and Munich.\" Adam Keller of Gush Shalom says: \"The strange thing is that, when this outbreak of violence started, there was less hostility than there is now. It may be because at first people felt we could be ignored.\" Most of the demonstrators have done military service, which is compulsory in Israel - three years for men and two for women. The law does not recognise conscientious objection, but religious women can do social service instead. Unlike the United States during the Vietnam war, there is little resistance to military service, and the authorities are careful not to make martyrs of the few who refuse. One objector was jailed for three months but released early. In October, a serving soldier, Noam Kuzar, was sentenced to 28 days in military prison for refusing to take part in action against the Palestinians. He was released last Friday but, speaking to The Guardian on a mobile phone from his barracks, said that he is still waiting to hear about his future in the army. Other radical peace groups in Israel include Yesh Gvul, started by soldiers during the Lebanon war, New Profile, a group seeking to abolish conscription, and the Committee Against House Demolitions, set up two years ago to help Palestinians whose houses are demolished by the army. By far the largest organisation - but less radical - is Peace Now, started 22 years ago in the wake of the Sabra and Chatila massacres in Lebanon. It has, on occasions, mustered demonstrations of more than 200,000 people. Its guiding principle, according to director Gaby Lasky, is \"not to fight wars that are not imposed upon us. \"We want peace negotiations with all Israel's neighbours - it's not a one-border issue,\" she said. Unlike the more radical groups, Peace Now regards the 1967 borders as \"the basis for determining Israel's final borders.\" Peace Now draws its support mainly from the centre-left - the Labour and Meretz parties. This, according to the radicals, has placed its supporters in a dilemma: whether to remain loyal to Labour or to cling to their former peace slogans. Although many continue to back the government, \"we have been very outspoken against a coalition with Sharon [the Likud leader],\" Ms Lasky said. \"In opinion polls, a very high number of people still support the peace process - about 62 per cent. This has strengthened our belief that we have been right.\" Email brian.whitaker@theguardian.com Related special reports Israel &amp; the Middle East Other articles More articles by Brian Whitaker Useful links Yasser Arafat's office Ehud Barak's office Israeli government Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party) Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security) Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group) Organisation of Rabbis for the People of Israel Palestinian National Authority Women in Black Essay about Yesh Gvul and other peace activists Gush Shalom",

And only a handful have seized the opportunities presented by the internet to put a message to voters and get in touch with constituents. Researchers at public policy think-tank, the Institute of Economic Affairs, looked at the personal web sites of 97 MPs and found a \"mildly comic ineptitude\" in the construction of the sites. And Ms Hewitt's own site is one of the most horrid, it claims, going so far as to suggest that constituents contact her by post rather than email. The compiler of the research, Tom Steinberg, said: \"To misquote Microsoft, this is business at the speed of politics.\" The report, MPs' Websites, which was published in a recent Parliamentary IT briefing paper, goes on to state that Ms Hewitt is not alone in her apparent inability to utilise the internet as a political tool. \"Labour MP Gwyneth Dunwoody's site is typical, with its inept design, smattering of broken links and absolute lack of character. \"Normally, the party machines leap at the chance to put across a message to voters. In the field of MPs' websites, they have been curiously hesitant.\" Of the sites studied for the article, few members are singled out for praise. Labour MP Paul Flynn is \"a triumph of irreverent style\" and is \"kept lovingly up to date\", the report says - although at the time of writing, the site is down. Shadow Home Secretary Ann Widdecombe's 'Widdy Web' features \"a regular and fearsome stream of attacks on the government, plus a unique children's section\". The article argues that those who are less dedicated are missing a huge opportunity. \"The opportunity for a backbench MP to build up a good impression with constituents has never been as good as that presented by the internet today. \"A sitting MP who uses his or her site to educate and communicate with constituents, like Paul Flynn or Liberal Democrat Edward Davey, can build a better relationship and so hope for a degree of local loyalty at the following election.\" In the future, the article argues, MPs' websites will give \"a sense that the MP is an interesting, intelligent, likeable person who is more important than just a tiny cog in a huge political machine. \"No wonder the political parties are so loath to get involved.\" Useful links Original story Parliament unplugged MPs' websites: Patricia Hewitt (Lab, e-minister) Gwyneth Dunwoody (Lab) Peter Luff (Con) Paul Flynn (Lab) Ann Widdecombe (Con) Edward Davey (Lib Dem) Ernie Ross (Lab) Michael Connarty (Lab)",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It has been a long time coming, but Chinese cinema looks as though it has finally taken over the world. From Hong Kong, John Woo has conquered Hollywood with Face/Off and Mission: Impossible 2. The art-film cognoscenti have long been enamoured of the precision craftsmanship of mainland China's Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige. And, after years of trying, Jackie Chan has cracked the multiplexes (and wallets) of the west wide open. </p> <p>But it is a softly spoken 46-year-old who is arguably the most remarkable figure of this dazzling generation. Ang Lee, Taiwan-born but a long-time resident of the US, has in less than a decade forged a body of work that has put him at the forefront of the world's independent film-makers. The Wedding Banquet remains one of the most profitable low-budget films of the 90s. Sense and Sensibility received seven Oscar nominations (one actual statuette materialised, for Emma Thompson's screenplay). The Ice Storm is generally acknowledged as the finest treatment yet of the emotional emptiness of the 70s \"me\" decade. And it is conventional Hollywood wisdom that Lee will be the first Chinese film-maker to win the best director Oscar - though whether it will be for his new film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, is anyone's guess. </p> <p>In the flesh, Lee cuts an unassuming figure, a far cry from the stroppy weirdness of most American directors of his ilk, or the expensive suavity of other Chinese film-makers feted in the west. No Wong Kar-wai sunglasses for Ang Lee - he's neatly dressed but hardly cuts a dash in his suburban-store threads, and he never raises his voice above a gentle mutter. </p> <p>On the other hand, he doesn't seem as bemused by Hollywood success as John Woo, whose discomfort in the face of the west's fan worship is palpable whenever he has to appear in public. \"I feel very sorry for John Woo,\" says Lee, with real feeling. \"I was glad that he did Face/Off, but I feel he is unhappy making this movie Mission: Impossible 2. I'm glad it made so much money, though.\" </p> <p>Woo's blood-and-fire Hong Kong thrillers were achieved through the freedom granted by the armies of willing helpers typical of Hong Kong's film-making community; now, Woo has jumped straight into the upper echelons of studio Hollywood, where every line of dialogue and every foot of film is subject to executive interference and control. Lee, on the other hand, has trodden a much more measured path, negotiating his way through the more liberal environs of New York's independent film circuit. But even Lee has no firm answer to the question of how, exactly, the Chinese have managed it. </p> <p>\"It's kind of a chi [energy] thing,\" says Lee, deadpan. \"Everything is rotating. I think this generation, wherever we come from, shares a similar cultural background. We're brought up with Chinese melodrama but through education or whatever, we turn to other things. Now, in the climate of a declining film industry, no one knows what to do. Then boom-boom-boom, one or two films catch attention at film festivals and a world audience and we just keep making movies.\" </p> <p>Sitting alongside Lee is James Schamus, the academic-cum-producer who has worked on all of Lee's feature films. Schamus, currently associate professor of film theory at Columbia University, was there at the start of Lee's film-making career, when after six years of trying, Lee finally made his debut, Pushing Hands, in 1992. Schamus, a short, bespectacled New Yorker, talks lucidly about Chinese film-making's tradition of \"cross-national transactions\", and Asian cinema's propensity for \"co-financing interface structures\". Schamus gets excited about the reaction he sees \"against an uninformed but well-meaning critical community, which has often tended to pigeonhole Chinese directors into a specifically art-house idiolect. So that if you're from Taiwan, you're going to be an Edward Yang or a Hou Hsiao Hsien.\" </p> <p>At this point Lee interjects wearily: \"Long takes...\" </p> <p>Lee and Schamus together are conducting a war on several fronts. Firstly, as they are both acutely aware, Far East film-makers are generally the preserve of the international festival circuit, and their highly crafted films win plaudits but do little box-office. On the other hand, it is a challenge to turn a relatively sophisticated Chinese movie into a significant international hit. \"I have two sons in America,\" says Lee, \"and all they care about in Chinese culture is Jackie Chan and Jet Li. Those movies present probably the worst, most raucous part of Chinese culture. I want to straighten that out. So my parental affection comes into the project.\" </p> <p>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is based on the fourth \"episode\" of a five-strong series of novels by Du Lu Wang, and is quite obviously Lee's attempt to integrate Asian and American cinema. Filmed with all the aesthetic grace you would expect of one of China's auteur directors, it also contains the kind of spectacular, gravity-defying martial-arts action that Hong Kong's commercial cinema specialises in and is wrapped up with the sweetener of two of the region's most internationally bankable stars, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-fat. </p> <p>\"Because anticipation is high,\" Lee explains, \"I try to scoop up all the audience without disgracing myself. In Asia I have to deliver the film like a summer blockbuster, like a Jackie Chan movie; but afterwards I have to bring the movie to the west and release it like an art-house film, because of subtitles. I try to please everyone.\" He giggles. \"I look at American movies, the big muscles, and try to apply that to Chinese film-making.\" </p> <p>Lee's student years, in which he bounced from Taiwan to the United States, offer the perfect primer for his cross-cultural agility. Born and raised in Taiwan, the son of a schoolteacher, Lee spent two years at the country's academy of art, doing plenty of acting in the film and theatre department. He transferred to a drama college in Illinois in 1978, when he was 23; two years later he won a place at New York's crucible of talent, the NYU's film-making course. Though Lee excelled at NYU, it wasn't the springboard for him that it became for contemporaries like Spike Lee and Jim Jarmusch. He spent almost two years making his \"thesis\" film, a Chinatown-meets-Little Italy love story called Fine Line. But by 1986, Lee was so dispirited with America's lack of interest in Chinese-inflected movies that he was on the verge of moving back to Taiwan with his wife and son. </p> <p>Winning an award at a film festival stopped him. In Lee's words, he'd become a \"hot student\". Six years of frustration followed, when one project after another bit the dust. Broke and desperate, Lee eventually heard about a script competition set up by the Taiwanese government and knocked together a screenplay called Pushing Hands, about an elderly tai-chi master living with his son's family in the New York suburbs. He also sent in, as an afterthought, a little number called The Wedding Banquet, which had been lying in his bottom drawer for a while. Pushing Hands took the top prize, The Wedding Banquet the second. Though Lee vastly preferred Banquet, the offer by Taiwan's Central Motion Pictures office to fund the prize-winner (to the tune of $400,000) was too good to turn down. In 1992, Lee finally became a film director. </p> <p>This is where Schamus, and his company Good Machine, came into the picture, producing Lee's New York-based movie. Good Machine also came on board Lee's second film, The Wedding Banquet, which unexpectedly hit a chord with its unfussy, intelligent appreciation of immigrant pressures. Released in the summer of 1993, The Wedding Banquet became one of the year's most profitable movies. Lee then headed back to Taiwan to make the cooking-equals-love movie Eat Drink Man Woman, his first attempt at continent-hopping film-making. (Says Schamus: \"Chinese films have a different way of working with crew and actors. The position of director is pretty much revered. It was a shock when we went on set in Taiwan, and it was all 'Mr Director this, Mr Director that.' \") </p> <p> Lee's transfer to the big league came from the most unlikely of sources - an offer to direct Emma Thompson's adaptation of Sense and Sensibility, at the height of the mid-90s Jane Austen revival. \"How can you resist working with Emma Thompson?\" asks Lee. \"In that film I didn't think I did anything new for myself as a film-maker, but I was bringing myself up to a new level. For an eastern director, it was the first significant western movie. Sense and Sensibility scared me because I had to prove I can endure a studio production, I can direct English language, I can work with a movie star, and so on.\" </p> <p>With that success, Lee and Schamus next embarked on The Ice Storm, the adaptation of Rick Moody's 70s-set novel, which again hit a chord with audiences, this time wallowing in 70s nostalgia. \"To me The Ice Storm was the newest period piece, a costume drama so to speak,\" says Lee. \"It was very scary, too, because it was so fresh in people's memories.\" </p> <p>Schamus concurs: \"People working on the movie were so into it. A lot of the unity of the movie's design came about because of Ang's ability to organise all the departments together in pre-production in a way that got everybody behind the vision of the film very early on. It was quite specific - he would do thematic charts, every scene, every image, and we'd sit through these endless pre-production meetings going through every scene.\" </p> <p>It's through comments like these that you can sense the ferocious single-mindedness that must lie behind Lee's easy-going facade. But in company with Schamus, he has clearly found a relationship that serves his talents perfectly. \"I'm not a business guy, I'm a director,\" he explains, \"but I don't like to work for hire. I don't like to deal with studios. I don't like to have conversations with executives. I pitch to the studio, then never talk to them until the test screening.\" </p> <p>If, as everyone expects, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon takes off like the thoroughbred it is, Lee will have cemented his place as a cross-cultural colossus, bridging styles, genres and languages in a way no film-maker has managed before. </p> <p>And what of the future? \"I don't know,\" he mutters in a quiet voice. \"I can make movies for ever.\"</p> <p> \u0095 The Guardian Interview with Ang Lee will take place on Tuesday at London's National Film Theatre.

      "bodyText": "It has been a long time coming, but Chinese cinema looks as though it has finally taken over the world. From Hong Kong, John Woo has conquered Hollywood with Face/Off and Mission: Impossible 2. The art-film cognoscenti have long been enamoured of the precision craftsmanship of mainland China's Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige. And, after years of trying, Jackie Chan has cracked the multiplexes (and wallets) of the west wide open. But it is a softly spoken 46-year-old who is arguably the most remarkable figure of this dazzling generation. Ang Lee, Taiwan-born but a long-time resident of the US, has in less than a decade forged a body of work that has put him at the forefront of the world's independent film-makers. The Wedding Banquet remains one of the most profitable low-budget films of the 90s. Sense and Sensibility received seven Oscar nominations (one actual statuette materialised, for Emma Thompson's screenplay). The Ice Storm is generally acknowledged as the finest treatment yet of the emotional emptiness of the 70s \"me\" decade. And it is conventional Hollywood wisdom that Lee will be the first Chinese film-maker to win the best director Oscar - though whether it will be for his new film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, is anyone's guess. In the flesh, Lee cuts an unassuming figure, a far cry from the stroppy weirdness of most American directors of his ilk, or the expensive suavity of other Chinese film-makers feted in the west. No Wong Kar-wai sunglasses for Ang Lee - he's neatly dressed but hardly cuts a dash in his suburban-store threads, and he never raises his voice above a gentle mutter. On the other hand, he doesn't seem as bemused by Hollywood success as John Woo, whose discomfort in the face of the west's fan worship is palpable whenever he has to appear in public. \"I feel very sorry for John Woo,\" says Lee, with real feeling. \"I was glad that he did Face/Off, but I feel he is unhappy making this movie Mission: Impossible 2. I'm glad it made so much money, though.\" Woo's blood-and-fire Hong Kong thrillers were achieved through the freedom granted by the armies of willing helpers typical of Hong Kong's film-making community; now, Woo has jumped straight into the upper echelons of studio Hollywood, where every line of dialogue and every foot of film is subject to executive interference and control. Lee, on the other hand, has trodden a much more measured path, negotiating his way through the more liberal environs of New York's independent film circuit. But even Lee has no firm answer to the question of how, exactly, the Chinese have managed it. \"It's kind of a chi [energy] thing,\" says Lee, deadpan. \"Everything is rotating. I think this generation, wherever we come from, shares a similar cultural background. We're brought up with Chinese melodrama but through education or whatever, we turn to other things.

      "bodyText": "So, the US election is four days away, and it's too close to call. Some say. Unless of course they think it's a solid margin for George W. Bush. At least we all agree that the candidates are diammetrically opposed, fighting an election in which the future of the planet is at stake? Sort of, except that anybody knows they are dreadful candidates, with no burning issues dividing them, and the whole thing is as important as the candidates' hairlines. It's the fuzzy election - to every assumption about the event everyone knows nothing about, someone else will put the opposite case. That's fine, but this was also supposed to be the net election - the poll in which voters surfed the net to look for answers and crystallise their opinions. As the USA Today claims in its report on a Bush/Gore site traffic survey, that hasn't happened. Hits to the official sites have been low, as has web advertising by the main parties. If you're Al Gore - the net-savvy candidate with a slight deficit in the polls - you have to say you've missed a trick. Here's why. First, users tend to visit not blandly partisan websites, but pages they get told about in the office or the pub.

      "body": "<p>\u0095 Longtime Hong Kong action queen <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Yeoh,+Michelle\">Michelle Yeoh</a>'s (pictured) star is on the rise in the West. Not only has she got the triumphant Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon coming up, but <a href=\"http://www.aint-it-cool-news.com/display.cgi?id=\" 7342\"\">Ain't It Cool</a> has it that her first Bond performance, the only good thing about <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0120347\">Tomorrow Never Dies</a>, may be rewarded by a second appearance in the franchise. Brosnan is pushing for her inclusion in the as-yet untitled Bond 20 and her agent is currently in negotiations. She'd be only the second Bond girl to return, after Eunice Gayson's double appearance in Dr No and From Russia with Love. Not counting Moneypenny, of course.</p> <p>\u0095 After the recent news that <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Willis,+Bruce\">Bruce Willis</a> will no longer don his action vest, it turns out that the flavour of his remaining raucous projects will alter somewhat in the light of his change of heart. <a href=\"http://www.darkhorizons.com/news.htm\">Dark Horizons</a> reports that the forthcoming Die Hard 4 will - according to Willis - have more of a \"human dimension and focus on emotion\". And there'll be no naughty words. Hmm</p> <p>\u0095 New York is awash with rumours about the state of <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Ford,+Harrison\">Harrison Ford</a>'s marriage, according to <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/\">the Mirror</a>. The crumpled hunk was seen chatting intimately to Lara Flynn Boyle - until recently stepping out with another spring chicken, Jack Nicholson - at a showbiz bash earlier this month. And the plot thickened when Ford was this week seen checking into an NYC hotel on his own, just blocks away from the apartment that he shares with his wife of 17 years, Melissa Mathison, and his two kids.</p> <p>\u0095 Almost Famous star Kate Hudson has revealed the sartorially minimal preferences of her family to, rather foolishly, <a href=\"http://www.nationalenquirer.com/\">the National Enquirer</a>. Apparently Hudson, mum Goldie Hawn and dad Kurt Russell are all fervent nudists. \"I come from a totally naked family!\" she says. \"People are weirded out when I say that, but it's true. We don't walk around nude when other people are around, but when it's just us, I've walked around my house naked a bunch of times.\" A dinner invitation to the Hawn household could be interesting.</p> <p>\u0095 The mammoth Lord of the Rings production currently going the distance in New Zealand has brought an incredible $15m (\u00a310.7m) into the Queenstown area alone, according to <a href=\"http://www.stuff.co.nz/inl/index/0,1008,468710a2202,FF.html\">Stuff</a>'s entertainment news. The 250-strong cast and crew have spent three one-month stints in the area since last year, doubtless flooding local businesses with demands for on-set catering and extra costumed orcs to the delight of all. The total cost of the saga has apparently risen to an astronomical $500m (\u00a3357m), which must be making New Line executives rather less ecstatic.</p> <p>\u0095 The River Phoenix cult carries on strong, seven years after his death outside LA's Johnny Depp-owned Viper Room. <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/PeopleNews/\">IMDb</a> reports that fans laid letters and flowers and lit candles on the spot where the unfortunate Phoenix expired on Halloween, the anniversary of his death. One tribute read: \"As a fellow actor I will always miss you. You were a very talented and gifted person.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Maori actor Temuera Morrison has confirmed he's playing the father of everyone's favourite bounty-hunting Star Wars lowlife Boba Fett in Episode II. He told the <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/0011/03/entertainment/entertain1.html\">Sydney Morning Herald</a> that Boba is a pimply 12-year-old in the new instalment and that as his father Jango, he must undertake such paternal duties as kick Obi-Wan Kenobi's arse. With the help of a clone army, apparently. Morrison also let slip that he says the handily quotable line: \"I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe.\" Hmm: Fett cheese?</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Longtime Hong Kong action queen Michelle Yeoh's (pictured) star is on the rise in the West. Not only has she got the triumphant Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon coming up, but Ain't It Cool has it that her first Bond performance, the only good thing about Tomorrow Never Dies, may be rewarded by a second appearance in the franchise. Brosnan is pushing for her inclusion in the as-yet untitled Bond 20 and her agent is currently in negotiations. She'd be only the second Bond girl to return, after Eunice Gayson's double appearance in Dr No and From Russia with Love. Not counting Moneypenny, of course. \u0095 After the recent news that Bruce Willis will no longer don his action vest, it turns out that the flavour of his remaining raucous projects will alter somewhat in the light of his change of heart. Dark Horizons reports that the forthcoming Die Hard 4 will - according to Willis - have more of a \"human dimension and focus on emotion\". And there'll be no naughty words. Hmm \u0095 New York is awash with rumours about the state of Harrison Ford's marriage, according to the Mirror. The crumpled hunk was seen chatting intimately to Lara Flynn Boyle - until recently stepping out with another spring chicken, Jack Nicholson - at a showbiz bash earlier this month. And the plot thickened when Ford was this week seen checking into an NYC hotel on his own, just blocks away from the apartment that he shares with his wife of 17 years, Melissa Mathison, and his two kids. \u0095 Almost Famous star Kate Hudson has revealed the sartorially minimal preferences of her family to, rather foolishly, the National Enquirer. Apparently Hudson, mum Goldie Hawn and dad Kurt Russell are all fervent nudists. \"I come from a totally naked family!\" she says. \"People are weirded out when I say that, but it's true. We don't walk around nude when other people are around, but when it's just us, I've walked around my house naked a bunch of times.\" A dinner invitation to the Hawn household could be interesting. \u0095 The mammoth Lord of the Rings production currently going the distance in New Zealand has brought an incredible $15m (\u00a310.7m) into the Queenstown area alone, according to Stuff's entertainment news. The 250-strong cast and crew have spent three one-month stints in the area since last year, doubtless flooding local businesses with demands for on-set catering and extra costumed orcs to the delight of all. The total cost of the saga has apparently risen to an astronomical $500m (\u00a3357m), which must be making New Line executives rather less ecstatic. \u0095 The River Phoenix cult carries on strong, seven years after his death outside LA's Johnny Depp-owned Viper Room. IMDb reports that fans laid letters and flowers and lit candles on the spot where the unfortunate Phoenix expired on Halloween, the anniversary of his death. One tribute read: \"As a fellow actor I will always miss you. You were a very talented and gifted person.\" \u0095 Maori actor Temuera Morrison has confirmed he's playing the father of everyone's favourite bounty-hunting Star Wars lowlife Boba Fett in Episode II. He told the Sydney Morning Herald that Boba is a pimply 12-year-old in the new instalment and that as his father Jango, he must undertake such paternal duties as kick Obi-Wan Kenobi's arse. With the help of a clone army, apparently. Morrison also let slip that he says the handily quotable line: \"I'm just a simple man trying to make my way in the universe.\" Hmm: Fett cheese?",

      "byline": "Julian Glover",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>1. Character </b> <br> From beginning to end, the presidential election race has hinged on the character of the two candidates. Voters have big doubts about both <a href=\"http://www.AlGore2000.com/\" target=\"_new\"> Al Gore </a> and <a href=\"http://www.georgewbush.com/\" target=\"_new\"> George Bush </a>: the winner is likely to be the candidate Americans decide they dislike least. <p>George Bush has been marked as a grinning, <a href=\"http://politics.slate.msn.com/Features/bushisms/bushisms.asp\" target=\"_new\"> gaffe-prone airhead </a> with little knowledge of domestic issues and none of foreign affairs. Rumours about his behaviour at university, his conviction for drink driving in 1976 and videos of him drunk at a wedding party have not helped his cause. However, the Yale and Harvard-educated Bush is no dimwit, even if he doesn't pretend to match Al Gore for intellect and has never written a book. In fact his amiable vagueness is an attraction for many voters: it certainly didn't do Ronald Reagan any harm.</p> <p>Al Gore is leaden where Mr Bush is light, informed where Mr Bush is ignorant. His worthy plugging of the merits of big government means he scores well with the electorate on policy issues. But voters see him as excruciatingly dull: a sort of know-all teacher's pet. That is not the kind of president most Americans want and is the prime reason his campaign is in trouble. </p> <p>As a result, Mr Gore is trying to show the softer side to his character, kissing his wife passionately at this summer's Democratic convention and even giving an interview barefoot on a beach. Will this do the trick by polling day? If it does, the White House will almost certainly be his. </p> <p><b>2. Bill Clinton</b></p> <p>The sitting president, Bill Clinton, will <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,390837,00.html\" target=\"_new\"> influence the result </a> in two big ways. The Lewinsky affair and Mr Clinton's high-pressure fundraising techniques have tainted Mr Gore's reputation for moral integrity. That has been a big boost for George Bush.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr Clinton's success in combining economic growth with a budget surplus has helped the Democratic cause. Republicans have found it hard to convince voters that America has been mismanaged while Al Gore has been number two at the White House.</p> <p><b>3. Vice-presidents </b></p> <p>The battle of character extends to the deputies. Both were chosen to make up for the weaknesses of the main candidates.</p> <p>Al Gore is running with the Connecticut senator <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,351514,00.html\" target=\"_new\"> Joseph Lieberman </a>. As a strong moral critic of Bill Clinton's personal behaviour, he has added credibility to the Gore campaign. Not least because, as a devout Orthodox Jew, Mr Lieberman appeals to many voters doubtful about the integrity of his running mate. If Mr Gore wins, commentators will see Mr Lieberman's selection as a key factor in his success.</p> <p>Dick Cheney, George Bush's deputy, has had a lesser impact on the campaign. A prosperous oil executive from Wyoming, he has a long record of service in high office, including a spell as defence secretary to Mr Bush's father, the former president. As such, Mr Cheney has added gravitas to a lightweight campaign, but not enough to outweigh more pressing factors.</p> <p><b>4. Debates </b></p> <p>In a close year, the series of televised debates between the presidential candidates can swing the election. </p> <p>This year, Al Gore was widely tipped to crush George Bush in each of the three 90-minute official debates and romp to power. It did not work out that way. Mr Gore's aggressive style in the first debate saw him beat Mr Bush on points - but polls afterwards showed that voters liked Mr Bush's gentle approach. </p> <p>Mr Gore changed his style in the second debate, only to find commentators slamming him for letting Mr Bush's assertions pass unchallenged. In the third debate Mr Gore came out narrowly on top, but by then it was too late. George Bush had survived.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the single vice-presidential debate resembled a friendly fireside chat. Overall, then, this year's debates have settled nothing. The field is still wide open.</p> <p><b>5. Texas </b></p> <p>Al Gore is pushing the<a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,390883,00.html\" target=\"_new\">Texas factor</a> hard, claiming that his rival's poor record on education and pollution as the governor of the state makes him unfit to run the country. But Mr Bush's campaign has been just as eager to rebut all the claims and the tit-for-tat warfare is likely to alienate voters, not energise them. Republicans even point to Mr Bush's links with Texas as a positive point: unlike Mr Gore, they say, he is not part of the Washington elite.</p> <p>One issue can't be hidden, though: Texas' rapid-fire use of the <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,332204,00.html\" target=\"_new\"> death penalty.</a> Though both candidates say they support its use, many voters find the 150 executions Mr Bush has authorised as governor hard to stomach. Many others, of course, welcome the Texan's hardline stance on crime. The impact on election day is hard to predict. </p> <p><b>6. Ralph Nader</b></p> <p><a href=\" http://www.votenader.com/\" target=\"_new\"> Ralph Nader </a>, the green candidate, has found himself under the media spotlight in the past fortnight as commentators have realised that he <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,337255,00.html\" target=\"_new\"> could deny Al Gore the presidency</a>. </p> <p>Almost all his supporters are natural Democrats, whose support Al Gore will badly miss. National polls put Mr Nader on 2-5%, which is bigger than the margin of difference in many states and could hand victory to George Bush.</p> <p>As a results Democrats are piling on the pressure, asserting that a vote for Nader is, in effect, a vote for Bush. Will this strategy gain Al Gore a vital extra point or two in the polls? So far, there is little sign of it.</p> <p>Pat Buchanan, the fourth candidate, scores only around 1% in the polls - but as an ex-Republican running as a rightwing Reform candidate he will cost Mr Bush some votes. Mr Buchanan is most interesting for his running mate: against expectations he chose a black woman, Ezola Foster.</p> <p><b>7. Abortion </b></p> <p>The United States has always been unsettled about abortion. Many voters and politicians abhor it, while others defend a woman's right to choose. Al Gore comes down in the latter camp; Bush, almost certainly, in the former. Some voters fear that Bush will appoint hardline judges to the supreme court, who will overturn the court's crucial decision in favour of abortion. That fear works in Gore's favour. </p> <p><b>8.

Plenty of other voters, however, depend on the services that federal government protects and provides. </p> <p>The election race reflects this divide. George Bush, the natural home for big-government sceptics, has taken care to paint himself as a middle-of-the road moderate. And Al Gore, who really is a moderate with a long history of backing reform of the way government works, has adopted a more traditionalist, left-of-centre pro-government agenda.</p> <p>He may look back on this as <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/US_election_race/Story/0,2763,389546,00.html\" target=\"_new\">his big error</a>.

Taxation </b></p> <p>The healthy state of the US economy means that government income exceeds expenditure. The dilemma for the candidates is: what balance should they strike between tax cuts and expenditure? </p> <p>George Bush plans to devote half of the surplus \"to saving Social Security\u0085 one-quarter for pro-growth tax cuts; and the remainder to reform education, strengthen Medicare and support other priorities\". </p> <p>Al Gore proposes a complex scheme of targeted tax relief, covering things such as health care, the environment, business growth and college education. This has appealed to voters worried that a Republican president would slash welfare programmes, but alienated others who see Gore as an outdated fan of interventionist big government.</p> <p><b>11.Education </b></p> <p>George Bush has not made education a priority, in contrast with Al Gore, the traditional Democrat. </p> <p>Gore's plan involves greater federal supervision of the nation's schools and a sizeable increase in spending - another complex scheme which appeals to some voters and deters others. </p> <p><b>12.

      "bodyText": "1. Character From beginning to end, the presidential election race has hinged on the character of the two candidates. Voters have big doubts about both Al Gore and George Bush : the winner is likely to be the candidate Americans decide they dislike least. George Bush has been marked as a grinning, gaffe-prone airhead with little knowledge of domestic issues and none of foreign affairs. Rumours about his behaviour at university, his conviction for drink driving in 1976 and videos of him drunk at a wedding party have not helped his cause. However, the Yale and Harvard-educated Bush is no dimwit, even if he doesn't pretend to match Al Gore for intellect and has never written a book. In fact his amiable vagueness is an attraction for many voters: it certainly didn't do Ronald Reagan any harm. Al Gore is leaden where Mr Bush is light, informed where Mr Bush is ignorant. His worthy plugging of the merits of big government means he scores well with the electorate on policy issues. But voters see him as excruciatingly dull: a sort of know-all teacher's pet. That is not the kind of president most Americans want and is the prime reason his campaign is in trouble. As a result, Mr Gore is trying to show the softer side to his character, kissing his wife passionately at this summer's Democratic convention and even giving an interview barefoot on a beach. Will this do the trick by polling day? If it does, the White House will almost certainly be his. 2. Bill Clinton The sitting president, Bill Clinton, will influence the result in two big ways. The Lewinsky affair and Mr Clinton's high-pressure fundraising techniques have tainted Mr Gore's reputation for moral integrity. That has been a big boost for George Bush. Meanwhile, Mr Clinton's success in combining economic growth with a budget surplus has helped the Democratic cause. Republicans have found it hard to convince voters that America has been mismanaged while Al Gore has been number two at the White House. 3. Vice-presidents The battle of character extends to the deputies. Both were chosen to make up for the weaknesses of the main candidates. Al Gore is running with the Connecticut senator Joseph Lieberman . As a strong moral critic of Bill Clinton's personal behaviour, he has added credibility to the Gore campaign. Not least because, as a devout Orthodox Jew, Mr Lieberman appeals to many voters doubtful about the integrity of his running mate. If Mr Gore wins, commentators will see Mr Lieberman's selection as a key factor in his success. Dick Cheney, George Bush's deputy, has had a lesser impact on the campaign. A prosperous oil executive from Wyoming, he has a long record of service in high office, including a spell as defence secretary to Mr Bush's father, the former president. As such, Mr Cheney has added gravitas to a lightweight campaign, but not enough to outweigh more pressing factors. 4. Debates In a close year, the series of televised debates between the presidential candidates can swing the election. This year, Al Gore was widely tipped to crush George Bush in each of the three 90-minute official debates and romp to power. It did not work out that way. Mr Gore's aggressive style in the first debate saw him beat Mr Bush on points - but polls afterwards showed that voters liked Mr Bush's gentle approach. Mr Gore changed his style in the second debate, only to find commentators slamming him for letting Mr Bush's assertions pass unchallenged. In the third debate Mr Gore came out narrowly on top, but by then it was too late. George Bush had survived. Meanwhile, the single vice-presidential debate resembled a friendly fireside chat. Overall, then, this year's debates have settled nothing. The field is still wide open. 5. Texas Al Gore is pushing theTexas factor hard, claiming that his rival's poor record on education and pollution as the governor of the state makes him unfit to run the country. But Mr Bush's campaign has been just as eager to rebut all the claims and the tit-for-tat warfare is likely to alienate voters, not energise them. Republicans even point to Mr Bush's links with Texas as a positive point: unlike Mr Gore, they say, he is not part of the Washington elite. One issue can't be hidden, though: Texas' rapid-fire use of the death penalty. Though both candidates say they support its use, many voters find the 150 executions Mr Bush has authorised as governor hard to stomach. Many others, of course, welcome the Texan's hardline stance on crime. The impact on election day is hard to predict. 6. Ralph Nader Ralph Nader , the green candidate, has found himself under the media spotlight in the past fortnight as commentators have realised that he could deny Al Gore the presidency. Almost all his supporters are natural Democrats, whose support Al Gore will badly miss. National polls put Mr Nader on 2-5%, which is bigger than the margin of difference in many states and could hand victory to George Bush. As a results Democrats are piling on the pressure, asserting that a vote for Nader is, in effect, a vote for Bush. Will this strategy gain Al Gore a vital extra point or two in the polls? So far, there is little sign of it. Pat Buchanan, the fourth candidate, scores only around 1% in the polls - but as an ex-Republican running as a rightwing Reform candidate he will cost Mr Bush some votes. Mr Buchanan is most interesting for his running mate: against expectations he chose a black woman, Ezola Foster. 7. Abortion The United States has always been unsettled about abortion. Many voters and politicians abhor it, while others defend a woman's right to choose. Al Gore comes down in the latter camp; Bush, almost certainly, in the former. Some voters fear that Bush will appoint hardline judges to the supreme court, who will overturn the court's crucial decision in favour of abortion. That fear works in Gore's favour. 8. Big government Many American voters dislike federal government: they see it as a tax-hungry monster dominated by a metropolitian elite. Plenty of other voters, however, depend on the services that federal government protects and provides. The election race reflects this divide. George Bush, the natural home for big-government sceptics, has taken care to paint himself as a middle-of-the road moderate. And Al Gore, who really is a moderate with a long history of backing reform of the way government works, has adopted a more traditionalist, left-of-centre pro-government agenda. He may look back on this as his big error. By moving to shore up the core Democrat vote, he may have lost the support of the middle-class voters who twice elected Bill Clinton. 9. Health Care Al Gore promises action to control the cost of prescription drugs and to ensure all Americans have access to health care, a stance popular with older voters. It may be the reason for his campaign proving unexpectedly competitive in Florida, the retirees' state. George W Bush says much the same, but then describes Medicare, the state safety net for the old, as \"outdated\". This kind of talk worries some voters, though it reassures others who would prefer government money to return to them in the form of tax cuts. 10. Taxation The healthy state of the US economy means that government income exceeds expenditure. The dilemma for the candidates is: what balance should they strike between tax cuts and expenditure? George Bush plans to devote half of the surplus \"to saving Social Security\u0085 one-quarter for pro-growth tax cuts; and the remainder to reform education, strengthen Medicare and support other priorities\". Al Gore proposes a complex scheme of targeted tax relief, covering things such as health care, the environment, business growth and college education. This has appealed to voters worried that a Republican president would slash welfare programmes, but alienated others who see Gore as an outdated fan of interventionist big government. 11.Education George Bush has not made education a priority, in contrast with Al Gore, the traditional Democrat. Gore's plan involves greater federal supervision of the nation's schools and a sizeable increase in spending - another complex scheme which appeals to some voters and deters others. 12. Foreign Policy Foreign policy issues have not made headlines in the campaign so far, but events in Yugoslavia and the Middle East have pushed them up front in these last weeks before polling day. Polls show that Republicans are trusted more than Democrats when it comes to standing up for American interests around the world. That's the good news for George Bush. The bad is that no one doubts that it is Al Gore who has a far better understanding of world affairs. The question is whether Americans want a foreign policy expert in the White House. The two candidates' strengths and weaknesses on the issue will probably cancel each other out. 13. Petrol The rising price of oil has hit American motorists in their wallets and they are not happy. The issue carries dangers for both candidates. Al Gore has a reputation as an environmentalist who wants to reduce car use and regards energy taxation as a good thing. Voters who believe that he will increase petrol prices still further will be wary of electing him. George Bush and his running mate have both made money from oil companies, which many Americans see as one of the causes of rising gas prices. They may turn against Bush for profiting from their troubles.",

A Field Poll released yesterday - a seven-point Gore lead, with Nader at 4% - suggested that such a scenario was unlikely, but not impossible, even in California.</p> <p>\"Ralph Nader is telling potential voters who are inspired by his populist-left agenda to forget about pragmatism and 'vote your dreams.'

While the vice president maintains a still-comfortable, 15-point lead among female voters, that margin is down from 29 points in early October.</p> <p>\"Clues that help explain the erosion in Gore's support among women are hidden in the subgroups of female respondents.

      "bodyText": "California is the Big One. Easily the biggest state in the Union, it commands 54 votes in the presidential electoral college - that's 20% of the total needed to win the White House. At the outset of the campaign, most commentators assumed that the California contest was cut and dried for Al Gore. Even a couple of weeks ago, he was leading in the opinion polls by nearly 15%. All that has changed: George W Bush is campaigning vigorously in the state and has poured millions of dollars into an advertising blitz. Gore, his lead cut to around 7%, has been forced to divert his campaign from marginal states to shore up his crumbling support on the West Coast. President Clinton is also on the stump in California - although, at the insistence of the Gore camp, he is keeping well apart from his vice-president. The Los Angeles Times loftily eschews endorsing either candidate in the presidential race, but shrewdly sums up the contest: \"The 2000 presidential campaign boils down to this: \"Either vice president Al Gore will win because voters like his experience and positions on major issues, and because he is better prepared to be president, or Texas Gov George W. Bush will win because he is more likable and believable.\" Meanwhile, the paper wears its heart on its sleeve in backing the re-election campaign of Democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein. It particularly praises her for pressing for stricter gun laws. The San Francisco Chronicle chides those supporters of Green Party candidate Ralph Nader who argue that a Green vote will not be wasted, even if lets in a Republican president. \"The election remains close enough that even a modest-sized Nader vote could tip the result to Bush in several key states. A Field Poll released yesterday - a seven-point Gore lead, with Nader at 4% - suggested that such a scenario was unlikely, but not impossible, even in California. \"Ralph Nader is telling potential voters who are inspired by his populist-left agenda to forget about pragmatism and 'vote your dreams.' They may find, however, that the dream is a nightmare.\" The Sacramento Bee reports that Al Gore's healthy lead in the state is crumbling - down from 14% to a parlous 7%. Part of the vice-president's problem is that women voters are shifting allegiance: \"The most dramatic shift in Gore's support was among women. While the vice president maintains a still-comfortable, 15-point lead among female voters, that margin is down from 29 points in early October. \"Clues that help explain the erosion in Gore's support among women are hidden in the subgroups of female respondents. While Gore leads Bush by 60% to 30% among women employed full time, he evenly splits the vote with Bush among women not employed full time.\" The San Diego Union-Tribune reports President Clinton's last-minute swing through California to shore up the Gore vote \"Clinton followed Gore's trip to California earlier this week. Their trips counter Bush's decision not to simply hand the state to Gore without a fight. Bush is spending millions on statewide television ads - some in Spanish to target the Hispanic vote. \"Bush boasted that he would shock the nation by clenching California's 54 electoral votes, a fifth of the 270 needed to win. George Bush, in 1988, was the last Republican presidential candidate to carry California.\" The Coast Weekly in Monterey decries the widespread lack of interest among the electorate. \"This Tuesday, in what may be the closest presidential election in 40 years, just a tad more than half the eligible voters will exercise their right to vote. \"Americans, if they aren't actually indifferent to the democratic process, are giving a very good impression of people who are. Investigating the public's apparent disdain of politics has kept a lot of political and social scientists in work. \"The putative reasons that always make the short list are Richard Nixon and Watergate, Ronald Reagan and Contragate, and Bill Clinton and Zippergate. We suspect special interest money and cronyism have done their part, too.\" In Long Beach, the Press-Telegram has no doubts who should be president. \"The closer comes election day, the clearer becomes the choice. If you believe you're better off today than eight years ago, you ought to vote for George W Bush. It is Bush, not Al Gore, whose message of inclusiveness and moderation and values has resonated with voters. \"It has become a remarkable irony that Bush, not Gore, is the logical successor to the great centrist Bill Clinton.\" The Long Beach paper also has an exotic item about a speech to a local boys' and girls' club by a distinguished overseas visitor - John Major. He confided to the youngsters: \"I did nothing at school. I just wasted all my time there. \"To be rudely honest, I loathed school and left just before I was 16, with no qualifications.\" According to the paper, the former prime minister was quizzed by the fascinated youngsters about his life and work. One question concerned \"the UK's decision not to join the European Community\".",

      "bodyText": "Indian ocean islanders banished from their \"paradise\" home today won an historic high court battle with the British government. A representative islander, Louis Bancoult, claimed he and hundreds of others were unlawfully sent into poverty-stricken exile from the Chagos Islands some 30 years ago to clear the way for construction of the US military base on Diego Garcia. Today Lord Justice Laws, sitting with Mr Justice Gibbs, ruled there had been \"an abject legal failure\" and overturned a 1971 Immigration Ordinance which bans the islanders - the Ilois - from returning to their islands. Richard Gifford, solicitor for the islanders, said: \"The government will now have to come up with a lawful policy in the light of the judges' findings.\" After the judges handed down their ruling, the court began to discuss how the judgment should be implemented, and what formal orders should be made. If, and when, the islanders get back to all, or any part, of the Chagos Islands is now the crucial question. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office was later granted permission to appeal. The court granted a seven-day \"stay\" on the effect of the order to quash pending appeal moves. It was a stunning victory for Mr Bancoult, 37, chairman of the Chagos refugee group in Mauritius. After the ruling he said: \"I am very proud. This is a historic day for the people.\" Mr Bancoult has long fought for the right to return to where his people had lived for up to five generations before Britain entered into an agreement in the 60s allowing the Americans to build the major strategic air and naval base, used in the bombing of Iraq.

      "body": "<p>\"I am the master, I'm Raja you know,\" booms Raja Daswani, co-owner of Raja Fashions, which claims to be the largest tailor in Hong Kong. Forty-two-year-old Daswani, who this week took an order of six shirts for Tony Blair, is in his temporary atelier, a suite at London's Sheraton Park Tower hotel. He is striding over to his next customer, minutes after emailing his last sell (\u00a3900 for a couple of sports jackets, some trousers, a suit and two shirts, all bespoke) to his warehouse in Hong Kong, where his clothes are cut, stitched and mailed out in four weeks. Around the suite there are more clients waiting - one on a sofa, the others perched on a bed next door. </p> <p>\"I never mention names,\" says Daswani, who refuses to confirm Tony Blair's three blue and three white Sea Island cotton shirts at \u00a335 each, the measurements apparently taken from one of Tony's old shirts. \"I supply the Who's Who of London, but in my business it's confidential.\" </p> <p>Daswani and his three tailors spend most of the year travelling the world, providing their bargain bespoke (suits start at \u00a399) to a word-of-mouth clientele. The service is fast, breezy and, to some people, less intimidating than the traditional Savile Row and Jermyn Street service. </p> <p>To compare, Jermyn Street's Hilditch &amp; Key offer a made-to-measure shirt for \u00a3145 - but a customer must buy a minimum of six shirts. \"And you know Savile Row suits are made in the far east anyway,\" declares Daswani, though he provides no evidence to back up this contentious claim. \"We produce similar quality suits for a much, much better price. We work nonstop!\" </p> <p>The customers bustling around the rooms can't believe their luck. \"I saw a small advert in the papers the other week and made an appointment,\" says an Oxford-based gent, whose wife is sat against the window with views out to Crystal Palace, choosing between aubergine and rose-red fabric for her just-measured jacket. \"I had two suits made in Hong Kong twelve years ago and they're still brilliant,\" he explains. </p> <p>Daswani approaches. \"I need your charge card.\" </p> <p>\"You haven't told me the damage yet,\" blusters the gent. \"Do I get a discount for cash?\" </p> <p>\"Charge card only. We're an offshore company. Pay in Hong Kong dollars.\" </p> <p>This extreme version of travelling salesmanship exploits a niche in the market. Businessmen have always taken advantage of the cheap tailoring in the far east, where streets are lined with knock-down price, quick turnaround stores. As his clients can't always get to Raja Fashions in Kowloon, Daswani brings Raja Fashions to them, with startling efficiency. In an intense burst of activity, thousands of measurements are taken during a week's stay in London, then emailed immediately to his tailors, along with a scanned photograph of the client. </p> <p>The speed does not take away any of the detailing - one portly customer demands an outsized watch pocket in his trousers and, against Daswani's wishes, keeps his jacket sleeves over the wrists, even though a well-known sign of a bespoke suit is a precise half-inch of shirt peeking out. </p> <p>The service provided by Raja Fashions isn't unique, it's just cheap and hi-tech. As well as arranging hotel fittings with visiting businessmen, London tailors often spend time abroad, taking advantage of the Jermyn Street and Savile Row legacy. </p> <p>\"A lot of Americans like to be individuals and they like British shirts,\" says Roger Talbot, general manager of Hilditch &amp; Key. Talbot has just returned from his bi-annual trip to America, writing individually to his clients to alert them of his arrival, then staking base-camp in New York and Washington hotels. Newly revitalised fashion houses are trading on the \"bespoke\" heritage, too - at their recently opened Bond Street flagship, Burberry offer a made-to-measure and bespoke suit service, with prices from \u00a3599 to \u00a32,000. </p> <p>But it is the peculiar, guilty psychology of buying bespoke at a cheaper price than off-the-peg that makes Blair's order so intriguing. His choice is in direct contrast to those of his two main rivals, William Hague and Gordon Brown. Hague caused a furore in August when he told GQ that his shoes were made bespoke at GJ Cleverly in Royal Arcade, off Bond Street, for \u00a31,500, presumably as advised by his late friend, the dapper John Morgan. And Brown has bespoke suits made at Savile Row tailor Norton &amp; Townsend, where a three-piece costs up to \u00a31,200. But then, with Brown's more wayward figure, perhaps he needs the impression of corrective surgery that only ingenious tailoring can provide. </p> <p>Once you get past the stigma, Daswani offers a refreshing and sometimes thrilling service. Author Beryl Bainbridge has admitted to having a suit made - hers took \"five minutes\" to measure and fitted her \"perfectly\". Clearly one client who didn't mind being associated with cut-price tailoring, she was especially impressed that her name was stitched inside in gold thread. </p> <p>Daswani is in London until Sunday, before flying off to New York. He will be back in this country in December. Pre-Christmas is his busiest time and Daswani doesn't expect to see his family in Hong Kong for any length of time until the New Year. But to satisfy his clients while he's away, Daswani has set up a shirt service on the internet, at <a href=\"http://www.eshirts.com.hk\">www.eshirts.com.hk</a>, which offers shirts with a more remote service. </p> <p>\"This is our twentieth time here in two years,\" says Daswani, who shows no sign of fatigue or boredom at his life on the move. \"We leave here on Sunday and we're fully booked. We'd love to stay, but we've got to go and clothe the other people in the world.\" </p> <p> Additional reporting: Hadley Freeman </p> <p>\u0095 Raja Fashions will be at London's Sheraton Park Tower hotel (020-7235 8050) on December 4-10 and Birmingham's Hyatt Regency hotel (0121 643 1234) on December 11 and 12.

He aimed as much at a non- specialist audience as at fellow academics.</p> <p>For Runciman, the crusades were the last of the barbarian invasions; their disaster was their failure to understand Byzantium. \"High ideals were besmirched by cruelty and greed, enterprise and endurance by a blind and narrow self-righteousness,\" he wrote, \"and the holy war itself was nothing more than a long act of intolerance in the name of God, which is a sin against the holy ghost.\"</p> <p>Runciman was the second son of the 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford, who was descended from the mid 18th- century Scottish painter, Alexander Runciman. His father was a member of Asquith's cabinet and his mother was MP for St Ives. He himself always welcomed the fact that, as the younger son, he was not obliged to go either into politics or the family's shipping business.

His school friends included Cyril Connolly, George Orwell and \"Puffin\" Asquith, the prime minister's son.</p> <p>In 1921, a further scholarship took him to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he began to demonstrate an elegant and fashionable aestheticism by papering his rooms with a French grisaille wallpaper depicting Cupid and Psyche, and being photographed by his friend, Cecil Beaton, with a parrot poised on his ringed finger. Through his school friend George Ry lands, he was introduced to John Maynard Keynes, Lytton Strachey and Virginia and Leonard Woolf, and got to know the Bloomsbury group.</p> <p>After taking a first in history, Runciman became a research student of the notoriously elusive JB Bury, the first British historian to take Byzantium seriously. He artfully discovered the regius professor's regular habit of taking an afternoon walk along the Backs, and was thus able to manoeuvre Bury into giving him unofficial tutorials.</p> <p>Following an attack of pleurisy - and his doctor's prescription that his best chance of recovery would come from a long sea voyage - he went to China, arriving in the middle of the civil war.

On his return to Cambridge, he concentrated on his fellowship thesis, with pioneering investigations into Armenian and Syriac sources, which, in 1929, resulted in his first book, The Emperor Romanus Lecapenus. After that, in quick succession, came The First Bulgarian Empire and Byzantine Civilisation.</p> <p>Runciman had gone back to Trinity in 1927 to teach and hold a fellowship until 1938. His first pupil had been Guy Burgess, whom he remembered for his intellectual brilliance and his dirty fingernails. His last pupil was Donald Nicol, who became Koraes professor of modern Greek and Byzantine history at London University. Meantime, his travels had taken him to Jerusalem and Thailand, with several more visits on foot and muleback to Greece and Turkey.</p> <p>When his grandfather died in 1938, Runciman could afford to give up his fellowship, and take George Trevelyan's advice to leave Cambridge and concentrate on his writing. By a happy chance, the war took him back to the countries of his choice, first as press attach\u00e9 in Sofia in 1940, then to Cairo and Jerusalem for the Ministry of Information, and finally to Istanbul for three years as professor of Byzantine art and history.

During the next two years, assisted by Paddy Leigh Fermor and Rex Warner, this remarkable triumvirate endeared themselves to the Greeks in a manner that has never been rivalled. In Athens, Runciman became a well-known figure in the smart Kolonaki set (\"the good bandit families\", as he characteristically called the descendants of the leaders of the Greek war of independence) and was a friend of George Sepheriades, the diplomat whose poetry, under the name of Sepheris, later won a Nobel prize. In his spare time, he improved his collection of icons, tanagras (figurines) and Edward Lears.</p> <p>A fter the publication, in 1947, of The Medieval Man- ichee, a still unchallenged study of the Christian dualist heresy, Runciman returned to Britain to start work on the crusades, dividing his time between his house in St John's Wood, London, and the isle of Eigg, off the Scottish coast, which his father had bought in 1926. From 1951 to 1967, he was chairman of the Anglo-Hellenic League, which he nicknamed \"the Anglo-Hell\".</p> <p>His reputation was triumphantly established when A History Of The Crusades was published in three volumes, between 1951 and 1954.

      "bodyText": "Sir Steven Runciman, the historian, aesthete and traveller, who has died aged 97, was the pre-eminent British specialist of the Byzantine empire and of the crusades. His three-volume A History Of The Crusades, published between 1951 and 1954, set out to exemplify his belief that the main duty of the historian was \"to attempt to record, in one sweeping sequence, the greater events and movements that have swayed the destinies of man,\" and show that history's aim was to give a deeper understanding of humanity. He aimed as much at a non- specialist audience as at fellow academics. For Runciman, the crusades were the last of the barbarian invasions; their disaster was their failure to understand Byzantium. \"High ideals were besmirched by cruelty and greed, enterprise and endurance by a blind and narrow self-righteousness,\" he wrote, \"and the holy war itself was nothing more than a long act of intolerance in the name of God, which is a sin against the holy ghost.\" Runciman was the second son of the 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford, who was descended from the mid 18th- century Scottish painter, Alexander Runciman. His father was a member of Asquith's cabinet and his mother was MP for St Ives. He himself always welcomed the fact that, as the younger son, he was not obliged to go either into politics or the family's shipping business. Indeed, an academic career was foreshadowed by his precocious ability to read French at three, Latin at six, Greek at seven and Russian at 11.

Foodoo.com, the recipe website in which the chefs all have equity, has shut up shop. A statement on the site, which launched in May, admitted it had been unable to secure further funding and was talking to creditors about voluntary liquidation. The news comes less than a week after Foodoo incubator Eos Internet Ventures was forced to admit defeat and wind down its operations after failing to find a cash injection. Foodoo's demise should come as a wake-up call to other fledgling dot.coms which believed that the magic ingredients - celebrity backing, former management consultants and a regular newspaper column in Sunday Business - would see them through the shake-out. The celebrity chefs all were given sections on the site that were meant to reflect their own personality. Foodoo.com was co-founded by former management consultants Chris Reohr and Martin Murphy, along with television producer Red Johnson and former head of PR and marketing at the Conran Restaurant Group, Victoria Parnis. Funding came through Eos, which was believed to have taken a 40% stake in Foodoo. Cracks begin to appear in Foodoo as early as July this year when it was disclosed that the website needed to raise \u00a310m to enable it to move into selling food, wine and cooking equipment. Other than tentative e-commerce plans, Foodoo's only revenue stream was from advertising on the website, which didn't kick in properly until the end of July, and content distribution deals with the likes of Amazon. When trying to raise start-up money, Mr Worrell Thompson was quoted as saying: \"There have been cock-ups in the past with food and drink sites where people have gone too far too soon. We have a much more sensible approach to running a dot.com site.\" Famous last words.",

      "body": "<p>The advertising industry is up in arms after the government made veiled threats to impose new limits on car adverts.</p> <p>A furious row erupted between the Advertising Association and the Department of Environment, Transport &amp; the Regions after the DETR said new research showed a possible correlation between speed scenes in car ads and the number of fatalities on the roads.</p> <p>The research, due to be made public at the end of the month, will show a link between the images that people see in advertising and their attitudes and desires about driving.</p> <p>Sara Price, head of public affairs at the AA, said: \"Antony Allsworth [head of road safety publicity at the DETR] is responsible for commissioning the government's road safety campaign. He is the driving force behind it and he's got to find a scapegoat.</p> <p>\"The DETR is worried that its own advertising has not had the right impact. Commercial advertising is always the easy target - they have to be seen to be doing something,\" she added.</p> <p>\"But there is a total lack of evidence. If advertising made the kind of claims they are making you'd expect to be hauled up in front of the ASA. It's easy to pick one or two ads and say the whole industry is wrong but show me how legislation would be any better.\"</p> <p>The government spends \u00a312m a year on road safety ads concerning everything from speed, drink driving, use of mobile phones and the wearing of seat belts.</p> <p>Many of them have used shockingly graphic images including the current \"belt-up\" campaign in which a child is hurled from the back seat to the front, killing his mother.</p> <p>A senior spokesperson at the DETR admitted that a single viewing of an advertisement would not influence behaviour and added that he had no evidence that people watch ads and then immediately act upon what they've seen.</p> <p>But he added that \"ads showing speeding cars can reinforce existing opinions and an ingrained tendency to want to go fast.</p> <p>\"If an ad shows a car going fast around corners viewers may think 'yes, I'd like a car like that so I can test it to the ultimate'.\"</p> <p>The spokesman would not say whether the DETR would seek to ban such car advertising altogether.</p> <p>\"What the DETR are saying to the ad industry is 'you will do what we say under the threat of legislation',\" said Ms Price.</p> <p>\"It's like putting a picket fence around a flock of birds and expecting them to stay there,\" said Rupert Howell, president of the IPA. </p> <p>\"If you don't want people to speed, don't make cars that are capable of doing more than 50mph or start paying more attention to what's going in film. It's pathetic. The government needs to stop with all this gesture politics.\"</p> <p>Figures from the DETR show that fatalities on the road are falling. In 1981 to 1985 the figure was 5,598 while today it stands at 3,423.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The advertising industry is up in arms after the government made veiled threats to impose new limits on car adverts. A furious row erupted between the Advertising Association and the Department of Environment, Transport &amp; the Regions after the DETR said new research showed a possible correlation between speed scenes in car ads and the number of fatalities on the roads. The research, due to be made public at the end of the month, will show a link between the images that people see in advertising and their attitudes and desires about driving. Sara Price, head of public affairs at the AA, said: \"Antony Allsworth [head of road safety publicity at the DETR] is responsible for commissioning the government's road safety campaign. He is the driving force behind it and he's got to find a scapegoat. \"The DETR is worried that its own advertising has not had the right impact. Commercial advertising is always the easy target - they have to be seen to be doing something,\" she added. \"But there is a total lack of evidence. If advertising made the kind of claims they are making you'd expect to be hauled up in front of the ASA. It's easy to pick one or two ads and say the whole industry is wrong but show me how legislation would be any better.\" The government spends \u00a312m a year on road safety ads concerning everything from speed, drink driving, use of mobile phones and the wearing of seat belts. Many of them have used shockingly graphic images including the current \"belt-up\" campaign in which a child is hurled from the back seat to the front, killing his mother. A senior spokesperson at the DETR admitted that a single viewing of an advertisement would not influence behaviour and added that he had no evidence that people watch ads and then immediately act upon what they've seen. But he added that \"ads showing speeding cars can reinforce existing opinions and an ingrained tendency to want to go fast. \"If an ad shows a car going fast around corners viewers may think 'yes, I'd like a car like that so I can test it to the ultimate'.\" The spokesman would not say whether the DETR would seek to ban such car advertising altogether. \"What the DETR are saying to the ad industry is 'you will do what we say under the threat of legislation',\" said Ms Price. \"It's like putting a picket fence around a flock of birds and expecting them to stay there,\" said Rupert Howell, president of the IPA. \"If you don't want people to speed, don't make cars that are capable of doing more than 50mph or start paying more attention to what's going in film. It's pathetic. The government needs to stop with all this gesture politics.\" Figures from the DETR show that fatalities on the road are falling. In 1981 to 1985 the figure was 5,598 while today it stands at 3,423.",

However, the informal bilateral meeting will have symbolic significance. The sight of an Irish government minister sitting down with Sinn Fein and SDLP ministers - less than a week after Mr Trimble's veto threat - will demonstrate the resolve of nationalist Ireland. The talks will provide graphic proof of the gulf separating republicans and unionists, which bodes ill for efforts to save the peace process.</p> <p><b> Sinn Fein</b><br></p> <p>Sinn Fein is adamant that today's meeting had to go ahead to make clear that republicans do not sit in government courtesy of unionist \"patronage\". The presence of Ms de Brun also shows that Sinn Fein remains deeply committed to making the Good Friday agreement work although the party has deep reservations about the state of the peace process, principally over the Ulster Unionists' commitment to the agreement.</p> <p>Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's education minister, accepts that Mr Trimble has faced down hardliners - at least until last Saturday.

Mr Trimble's provocative move will therefore have guaranteed that progress on disarmament has at best been set back, if not killed off altogether. In its recent statements the IRA has offered its usual support to Sinn Fein. However, security sources have suggested that there is unease among many IRA members at the sight of two Sinn Fein \"ministers of the crown\". The Real IRA appears to be growing in strength. Until now, it has not attracted a well-spread base of disaffected provisionals. The slow pace of the peace process could change that. The IRA leadership is particularly frustrated because it believes that it is living up to its commitment on disarmament.</p> <p><b> SDLP</b><br></p> <p>John Hume's Social Democratic and Labour party shares many of the frustrations of the republican movement, but the party believes that the IRA should make further gestures on disarmament.

The prime minister, Bertie Ahern, believes that Mr Trimble's ban on Sinn Fein has seriously destabilised the peace process because it undermines the one area of the agreement which was tailor-made for nationalists.</p> <p>The north south ministerial council has huge significance in the Irish republic. Many members of Mr Ahern's Fianna Fail party were sceptical about renouncing Dublin's territorial claim to the north, a key element of the agreement. They set aside their reservations on the basis of the north south body. Dublin is also frustrated with the British government over the Patten reforms and for what it sees as slow progress on scaling down security measures. Republicans have not been let off the hook by Dublin which wants to see progress on the arms issue.</p> <p><b> British government</b><br></p> <p>Peter Mandelson has been working frantically all week to navigate a middle way through the present crisis which allows all sides to save face. The Northern Ireland secretary bluntly told Mr Trimble that he must lift his ban on Sinn Fein ministers attending meetings of the cross border body. At the same time, however, the IRA should re-establish contact with the disarmament body to reassure unionists.</p> <p>\"It is not a matter of one or the other,\" Mr Mandelson said yesterday. \"It is both.\" His plans received a boost yesterday when the international arms inspectors said that the IRA was committed to the peace process.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson knows, however, that he has his work cut out because Dublin, republicans and unionists are deeply angered by the police bill. He rejects republican claims that he has watered down the Patten report, insisting that he has kept to its core principles. For unionists, however, the report is all too much.</p> <p><b> Ulster Unionists</b><br></p> <p>David Trimble has been described as the Houdini of British and Irish politics after he faced down his hardline colleague, Jeffrey Donaldson. But his victory came at a high price which may eventually be seen as the death knell of the peace process. The Ulster Unionist leader is deeply committed to the Good Friday agreement and relishes his role as first minister.</p> <p>Mr Trimble has no qualms about the core elements of the deal - power sharing with nationalists and co-operating with the Irish republic. However, he has barely any room for manoeuvre, thanks to Mr Donaldson who is stalking his every move.</p> <p>The optimists say that the Donaldson faction is slowing buying into the process which it initially rejected. Mr Donaldson is now an enthusiastic supporter of the assembly and its committee system, something he initially opposed.</p> <p>However, Mr Donaldson has drawn a line in the sand which Mr Trimble is unlikely ever to cross: without real disarmament Sinn Fein should not be in government.</p> <p>The hardliners will have another chance to challenge Mr Trimble in January. If there has been no movement on arms and the police bill has received royal assent, the future of the peace process will look distinctly uncertain.</p> <p><b>Reforming the RUC: Patten's blueprint, and the reality</b><br></p> <p>The future of policing has become one of the most contentious issues in the peace process since the publication of Chris Patten's report. Nationalists claim that the police bill, implementing the Patten reforms, has been diluted to appease unionists. Unionists claim that the bill dismantles the RUC.</p> <p><b>The main differences between the bill and the Patten proposals are:</b><br></p> <p>Force's name</p> <p><b> Patten said:</b> The Royal Ulster Constabulary should remain but change its name to Northern Ireland Police service.</p> <p><b> Bill says:</b> The RUC will remain but be called Police Service of Northern Ireland (incorporating the RUC).</p> <p>Badge</p> <p><b> Patten said:</b> The new police service should adopt a new badge and symbols free from any association with either the British or Irish states.</p> <p><b> Bill says:</b> The secretary of state may make regulations prescribing the design of an emblem for the police and regulating the use of that or any other emblem.</p> <p>Flag</p> <p><b>Patten said:</b> The union flag should no longer be flown from police buildings.</p> <p><b>Bill says:</b> Secretary of state will make decision in consultation with police board.</p> <p>Oath</p> <p><b>Patten said:</b> New oath, which does not mention crown, should be sworn by all members of police force, including existing RUC officers.</p> <p><b>Bill says:</b> Only new recruits will swear oath. But existing officers will be bound by new code of ethics which incorporates commitment in oath to uphold human rights.</p> <p>Police board</p> <p><b> Patten said:</b> Policing board should have the power to follow up any report from the chief constable by initiating an inquiry into any aspect of the police service or police conduct. Limitations on matters of \"national security, sensitive personnel matters and cases before the courts\".</p> <p><b> Bill says:</b> Secretary of state can block an inquiry if it would \"prejudice the prevention or detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders\".</p> <p><b> Other contentious issues include:</b><br></p> <p>District police partnerships</p> <p><b>Patten said:</b> DPPs should be able to contribute up to 3p in the pound to local policing costs.</p> <p><b> Bill says:</b> No mention of this in the bill.

However, he has barely any room for manoeuvre, thanks to Mr Donaldson who is stalking his every move. The optimists say that the Donaldson faction is slowing buying into the process which it initially rejected. Mr Donaldson is now an enthusiastic supporter of the assembly and its committee system, something he initially opposed. However, Mr Donaldson has drawn a line in the sand which Mr Trimble is unlikely ever to cross: without real disarmament Sinn Fein should not be in government. The hardliners will have another chance to challenge Mr Trimble in January. If there has been no movement on arms and the police bill has received royal assent, the future of the peace process will look distinctly uncertain. Reforming the RUC: Patten's blueprint, and the reality The future of policing has become one of the most contentious issues in the peace process since the publication of Chris Patten's report. Nationalists claim that the police bill, implementing the Patten reforms, has been diluted to appease unionists. Unionists claim that the bill dismantles the RUC. The main differences between the bill and the Patten proposals are: Force's name Patten said: The Royal Ulster Constabulary should remain but change its name to Northern Ireland Police service. Bill says: The RUC will remain but be called Police Service of Northern Ireland (incorporating the RUC). Badge Patten said: The new police service should adopt a new badge and symbols free from any association with either the British or Irish states. Bill says: The secretary of state may make regulations prescribing the design of an emblem for the police and regulating the use of that or any other emblem. Flag Patten said: The union flag should no longer be flown from police buildings. Bill says: Secretary of state will make decision in consultation with police board. Oath Patten said: New oath, which does not mention crown, should be sworn by all members of police force, including existing RUC officers. Bill says: Only new recruits will swear oath. But existing officers will be bound by new code of ethics which incorporates commitment in oath to uphold human rights. Police board Patten said: Policing board should have the power to follow up any report from the chief constable by initiating an inquiry into any aspect of the police service or police conduct. Limitations on matters of \"national security, sensitive personnel matters and cases before the courts\". Bill says: Secretary of state can block an inquiry if it would \"prejudice the prevention or detection of crime or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders\". Other contentious issues include: District police partnerships Patten said: DPPs should be able to contribute up to 3p in the pound to local policing costs. Bill says: No mention of this in the bill. Government says the issue will be reviewed. Oversight commissioner Thomas Constantine, former head of US drug enforcement agency Patten said: \"An eminent person, from a country other than the UK or Ireland, should be appointed... with responsibility for supervising the implementation of our recommendations.\" Nationalists are angry because the commissioner will oversee government's recommendations, rather than Patten's. Linking of anti-terrorist special branch with CID Patten said: \"We recommend that, as a first step, special branch and crime branch be brought together under the command of a single assistant chief constable.\" Bill says: Recommendation not in police bill because it is not a matter for legislation. Nationalists angry because government says it is commmitted to proposal only when security allows.",

      "bodyText": "Hopes among Britain's fuel protestors that yesterday's record profits by energy giant Shell will prompt deep cuts in the cost of petrol will be dashed by the chancellor, Gordon Brown, next week. Mr Brown is expected to forecast a budget surplus for this year far lower than the City is expecting. News from Shell that the tripling of the cost of crude oil since the start of 1999 had resulted in an 80% surge in profits in the third quarter prompted calls from campaigners for a windfall tax on oil companies. But the government - which was alarmed by reports that the public finances could be \u00a316bn or more in the black in the current financial year - was last night desperately seeking to massage down expectations of the size of the budget surplus. It is understood that the chancellor will adopt a deliberately cautious stance in next Wednesday's pre-budget report and predict a budget surplus that is likely to be in the region of \u00a310bn. Although that would still be twice as high as the \u00a35bn surplus predicted in the Budget, the chancellor is determined to quash any speculation of any massive pre-election giveaway. The Treasury shares Shell's view that the recent oil price is unsustainably high, and also believes that the severity of global and domestic competition will lead to a squeeze on profits and corporation tax receipts. \"We have no intention of repeating the mistakes of the late 1980s, when a temporary improvement in the public finances was wrongly thought to be permanent,\" one source said last night. The Anglo-Dutch oil company yesterday sought to defuse mounting anger over its profits by warning that crude oil prices could fall steeply next year. The company insisted that it made no money from its 11,000 UK petrol forecourts. Shell said its profits in the third quarter of this year were up to $3.25bn (\u00a32.1bn), a rate of around \u00a325m a day. But the company said this was almost entirely due to much higher oil and gas prices. Fuel protesters said the profits were \"scandalous\" and \"obscene\", and one called for a windfall tax on oil companies, including BP Amoco, which is set to disclose its own record earnings next week. But Mark Moody-Stuart, Royal Dutch-Shell chairman, said: \"These are exceptional results driven by an exceptional oil price. \"I have no doubt there will be leaner periods in the future just as there were in the past. \"After all, it is less than two years ago since Brent crude [the oil market's benchmark] fetched $10 a barrel.\" Brent fetched $30.45 a barrel in the third quarter, compared with $20.60 a year earlier. But Mr Moody-Stuart helped spark a fall in Shell's share price by warning that increased oil output by Opec producers and larger stock-piles could force prices down next year once this winter's peak of demand had passed. The City had already taken issue with Shell's $35m a day profits, arguing that they should have been higher and marking the group's shares down nearly 4% to 542p, the day's third-biggest blue chip mover. Analysts had expected profits of up to \u00a32.5bn. Shell said its exploration and production business had contributed more than 70% of its profits, partly driven by a $4bn cost cutting programme which is ahead of schedule. The group said 20% of its profits came from refining and marketing oil products, including its forecourt business which made no money - and had not for several years.",

      "body": "<p>A billion pounds worth of stock changed hands at lightening speed. The price slumped more than 8%, dragging the rest of the London market with it. Dealers speculated on how the collateral damage might be felt across Europe later today. </p> <p>The trigger for this selling frenzy? A \"strong buy\" note on Vodafone, Britain's biggest company, of course - issued by the research team at its house stock broker, UBS Warburg. </p> <p>Daniel Stillit and his team reckon that shares in the mobile phone group are headed towards 460p, but the rest of the market decided 253p was a more appropriate figure yesterday - down 23p - after the Warburg man realised he had to adjust his profit projections for Vodafone to take into account the amortisation of the cost of the group's third generation mobile licences. </p> <p>No matter that Mr Stillit's adjustments shaved less than 2% off his previous numbers. Word went round that Vodafone was massaging down expectations on profits ahead of its interim figures, which are less than two weeks away - a hanging offence about which chief financial policeman Howard Davies warned just a week ago. </p> <p>Of course, Vodafone was doing nothing of the sort. Shrewder market participants had simply noticed figures from Deutsche Telekom earlier this week, which showed that sales in Germany were rising at such a pace that the company was having to pump money into subsidising new customers, squeezing margins in the short term. </p> <p>In Vodafone's case, the assumption is that its Mannesmann business is suffering, if that is the right word, similar financial pressures. Hence analysts over here are tweaking their numbers in the run up to the formal half-time figures. </p> <p>Knocking \u00a315bn off the value of a \u00a3165bn entity because its business is growing more quickly than previously thought sounds a tad perverse. But setting jittery markets aside, the affair highlights once again the dangers associated with trying to control the flow of information in and around the City. </p> <p>Vodafone is in its \"closed period\" - the six week run-up to its figures when it cannot discuss anything about its trading or finances with anyone without making a full and very formal announcement. And if it did make an announcement during this period, the investment community would be jump ing up and down, noting how unusual the move was and speculating endlessly on what might be \"behind\" it. </p> <p>There must also be questions about who has a right to the research produced by investment banking analysts. If Mr Stillit can provoke an 8% run on the country's biggest company, at what stage do the regulators step in and demand that this expensively produced analysis is immediately shared with everyone, rather than restricted to the Warburg clients who are paying for it?

      "bodyText": "A billion pounds worth of stock changed hands at lightening speed. The price slumped more than 8%, dragging the rest of the London market with it. Dealers speculated on how the collateral damage might be felt across Europe later today. The trigger for this selling frenzy? A \"strong buy\" note on Vodafone, Britain's biggest company, of course - issued by the research team at its house stock broker, UBS Warburg. Daniel Stillit and his team reckon that shares in the mobile phone group are headed towards 460p, but the rest of the market decided 253p was a more appropriate figure yesterday - down 23p - after the Warburg man realised he had to adjust his profit projections for Vodafone to take into account the amortisation of the cost of the group's third generation mobile licences. No matter that Mr Stillit's adjustments shaved less than 2% off his previous numbers. Word went round that Vodafone was massaging down expectations on profits ahead of its interim figures, which are less than two weeks away - a hanging offence about which chief financial policeman Howard Davies warned just a week ago. Of course, Vodafone was doing nothing of the sort. Shrewder market participants had simply noticed figures from Deutsche Telekom earlier this week, which showed that sales in Germany were rising at such a pace that the company was having to pump money into subsidising new customers, squeezing margins in the short term. In Vodafone's case, the assumption is that its Mannesmann business is suffering, if that is the right word, similar financial pressures. Hence analysts over here are tweaking their numbers in the run up to the formal half-time figures. Knocking \u00a315bn off the value of a \u00a3165bn entity because its business is growing more quickly than previously thought sounds a tad perverse. But setting jittery markets aside, the affair highlights once again the dangers associated with trying to control the flow of information in and around the City. Vodafone is in its \"closed period\" - the six week run-up to its figures when it cannot discuss anything about its trading or finances with anyone without making a full and very formal announcement. And if it did make an announcement during this period, the investment community would be jump ing up and down, noting how unusual the move was and speculating endlessly on what might be \"behind\" it. There must also be questions about who has a right to the research produced by investment banking analysts. If Mr Stillit can provoke an 8% run on the country's biggest company, at what stage do the regulators step in and demand that this expensively produced analysis is immediately shared with everyone, rather than restricted to the Warburg clients who are paying for it? A regulatory dogs' dinner is in the making. Aussies advance Be prepared for a fresh wave of takeover speculation in the banking sector if National Australia Bank sets about trying to satisfy its appetite for a much bigger presence on this side of the world. The Australian bank, listed on the Sydney stock exchange, already owns Clydesdale and Yorkshire and is now preparing the ground for a new listing in London. On the way, City sources believe that NAB might be tempted to sweep up another bank. The prey being lined up by corporate finance matchmakers include Alliance &amp; Leicester and Bank of Scotland. The former is on the list because it offers a mix of businesses - branches in the south and middle of England and a link with the Post Office - which would fit snugly alongside NAB's operations in the north of England and Scotland. Paradoxically, the later is being touted because of its failed attempt to takeover NatWest a year ago and the fact it might complement NAB's business in Scotland, although a bell or two might go off at the competition authorities. BoS also owns part of Bank West in Australia, which could also be attractive to NAB. The BoS's highly regarded chief execu tive, Peter Burt, might even secure himself a bigger job as a result.

She started with her intensely personal care for the sick, disabled, or otherwise suffering survivors of Nazi concentration camps and their children.</p> <p>She was born into a happy Yorkshire family and planned to farm and breed prize cattle. But \"she always wanted to help people\", according to the mother, from whom she derived so much. Educated at Benenden school, in 1939 she gave a false age to join the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry, then went to work for the Special Operations Executive, that strange secret world into which members half-disappeared from their own families. At 18, she was married for a few weeks to a young naval officer, soon killed.</p> <p>In SOE, she lived and worked with men and women of different nations, who were smuggling themselves into occupied Europe as allied agents to probable capture, torture and death. She knew their greatest fears - whether they would be able to endure Nazi torture in interrogation; she knew the heroism of the resistance, in Poland and elsewhere, of ordinary people volunteering to help agents and allied prisoners-of-war, completely aware of what they faced.</p> <p>Thus she acquired a vast new family, and her life's course was set. She crossed into Europe in 1944 and, in 1945, saw - in the newly- liberated concentration camps - the living, dead and dying, the price that she had already known from afar, and the children they left.</p> <p>She joined relief organisations, and worked in the displaced persons camps, where, amid the ruins of Germany, people waited for permits to go to a new country. The young and strong could go, but the old, sick and disabled were regarded as wreckage. The relief organisations withdrew in 1952. Ryder stayed on, working alone.</p> <p>That year, she took some for a holiday to Norway and Denmark, with the help of former Norwegian and Danish resistance friends. Soon after, she obtained permission to bring camp survivors and former re sistance fighters to England for short holidays and treatment. She went on to establish homes for sick and disabled survivors in the European countries where hospitals had been destroyed, and holiday homes in England for people who had not known a holiday since before the war. For all this, she trusted in God and human love for funds and voluntary workers. Both came.</p> <p>In 1956, she founded the Sue Ryder Forgotten Allies Trust. Always, she felt fiercely about that forgetting, making her own work a living memorial to the millions of dead from the camps. The West German government initially refused compensation to national persecutees, resistance members, and those in the eastern European countries with which it had no diplo matic relations. In 1956, too, she made over her own home to become the centre of the work: the Old Rectory at Cavendish, Suffolk, a 16th-century house set in gardens.</p> <p>In 1959, World Refugee Year, Ryder won British government permission to bring 30 disabled survivors as permanent residents to Cavendish, on condition that she guaranteed their complete support for life. By 1965, she had established 30 homes in England, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece and Germany, and had plans for one in Israel. Each was truly a home - some with family bungalows or flats, and no regulations.</p> <p>Ryder's firm rule for her \"bods\", her affectionate term for her life guests or workers, was designed to reverse all camp regulations. There was chintz and flowers everywhere, privacy respected, and occupation for those able to undertake work. These were all attempts to restore personality and dignity to people bearing, with other wounds, their camp tattoo numbers. Through her, \"I learned to trust people again,\" was a constant refrain.</p> <p>Ryder travelled 50,000 miles a year, often driving herself in a van, carrying medical and other supplies over Europe, directing the erection of new homes, visiting each and everyone in them, sending Christmas presents and cards, each inscribed in the recipient's own language.</p> <p>She alone remembered the \"jail birds\" - boys, Russian or Polish especially, released from the camps in 1945, their families dead, homes destroyed, flung into grim postwar Germany to live on their wits. Some stole, others took vengeance, when chance came, on SS men. Many were executed by British and American courts; others were given life sentences in German prisons.</p> <p>For lesser criminals, no provision was made for education, rehabilitation, help to employment on release, or even citizenship. Like so many, they landed on Ryder's lap. In 1955, she had founded the St Christopher Kreis to aid them, and the St Christopher Settlement in Hanover, where they could be received and helped on release.</p> <p>She got a little help from a very few Germans - notably in Hesse - and from the German Red Cross, but, generally, met obstruction from authority. She drove regularly to visit, in different prisons, men, now grown up, who had not seen a woman for years until she came and fought for them, appeared in court for them, and sought amnesties or jobs overseas.</p> <p>I n 1959, she married Group Captain (later Lord) Leonard Cheshire, VC, a meeting and marriage of common dedication to suffering humanity. Besides his work in founding the Cheshire Homes for the chronic sick, and hers for Nazi victims, together they founded the Mission for the Relief of Suffering and the Ryder-Cheshire International Centre, called Raphael, at Dehra Dun in India, for children and adults, lepers, mentally sick, orphans and others in need. Working with them was Mother Teresa.</p> <p>The two Cheshire children, Jeremy and Elizabeth, completed the happy family atmosphere at Cavendish. There was amazing normality and laughter there, although men and women lived (and died) there suffering from unique physical and nervous damage.</p> <p>In her adolescence, Ryder was a typically fair English girl, with wavy hair and a small slender figure. Her frequent light smile was indescribable, flashing against grim backgrounds, illuminating her face, shadowed, when still, with her experience. When appealing for her survivors, she could look like the woman carrying the world's sorrows. Her brilliant blue, hooded eyes blazed from under striking eyebrows. By contrast, when she turned suddenly and lifted her daughter in her arms, her smile showed the natural joy that might have been hers completely, in a different world.</p> <p>She was without fear, moral or physical, ate little, slept little, was completely indifferent to her own comfort and often looked exhausted, yet she seemed, borne on by some inner fire of strength.

On Thursday October 5, as Serbs stormed the parliament in Belgrade, waving flags from its burning windows, and seized the headquarters of state television, which an opposition leader had once christened \"TV Bastille\", it looked like a real, old-fashioned European revolution. The storming of the Winter Palace! The fall of the Bastille!</p> <p>Now, surely, the last east European ruler to have remained in power continuously since the end of communism, the \"butcher of the Balkans\", would go the way of all tyrants. There were fevered reports that three planes were carrying Slobodan Milosevic and his family into exile. Or that he was holed up, Hitler-like, in his bunker. Would he be lynched? Or executed like Ceausescu? Or commit suicide, as both his parents had done?</p> <p>Instead, late on the evening of October 6, Milosevic appeared on another national television channel to make the kind of gracious speech conceding election defeat that one expects from an American president or a British prime minister. He had just received the information, he said, that Vojislav Kostunica had won the presidential election. (This from the man who had spent the last 11 days trying to deny exactly that, by electoral fraud, intimidation, and manipulation of the courts.) He thanked those who voted for him, but also those who did not. Now he planned \"to spend more time with my family, especially my grandson, Marko\". But then he hoped to rebuild his Socialist Party as a party of opposition. \"I congratulate Mr Kostunica on his victory,\" he concluded, \"and I wish all citizens of Yugoslavia every success in the next few years.\"</p> <p>Neatly dressed, as always, in suit, white shirt and tie, he stood stiffly beside the Yugoslav flag, with his hands crossed very low in front of him, like a schoolboy who had been caught cheating. It was incongruous, surreal, ridiculous in the pretence that this was just an ordinary, democratic change of leader.</p> <p>Yet that is exactly what the new president also wanted to pretend. President Kostunica told me later that Milosevic had telephoned him to ask if it was all right to make the broadcast, and he was delighted, because he wished to show everyone in Serbia that a peaceful, democratic transfer of power was possible. Earlier that same evening, Kostunica had appeared on the \"liberated\" state television, grey-suited and sober as ever, fielding phone-in questions from the public and talking calmly about voting systems, as if this were the most normal thing in the world.</p> <p>Yes, I found young people celebrating in front of the parliament building that night, blowing whistles and dancing. But most of the friends I talked to - people who had been working against Milosevic for years - expressed neither ecstasy nor anger, but a blend of wry delight and residual disbelief. Was he really finished?</p> <p>That was nothing to the bemusement of the world's journalists. Heck, wasn't this supposed to be a revolution? But the revolution seemed to have started on Thursday night and stopped on Friday morning. No more heroic scenes. No bloodshed. The Serbs had failed to deliver. They had disappointed CNN, and ABC, and NBC. The Palestinians and Israelis were more obliging. They were killing each other. So half the camera crews left for Israel the next day. Those who stayed went on wrestling with the question: what is this?</p> <p>First there was the election. Already on the night of Sunday September 24, a sophisticated and independent election monitoring group had told the opposition that Kostunica had won, and people danced in the streets of Belgrade until the early hours. But everyone knew that Milosevic would not concede defeat. He would probably try to \"steal the election\" fraudulently claiming extra votes from Montenegro and Kosovo. This was only the end of the beginning.</p> <p>Sure enough, Milosevic had the Federal Election Commission declare that Kostunica had won more votes than he had, but not enough to secure victory in the first round. There would have to be a run-off second round on October 8. The opposition now took a giant gamble, against the advice of many western politicians and supporters. They said no, we will not go to the second round. Instead, by orchestrating peaceful popular protest, they would force Milosevic to concede that he had lost the election. And they set a deadline: 3pm on Thursday October 5.</p> <p>The election campaign already had elements of revolutionary mobilisation, like that of the Solidarity election campaign in Poland in the summer of 1989. Revelection, so to speak. But now things developed more clearly toward a new-style peaceful revolution. People came out on the streets of Belgrade and other towns for large demonstrations. The opposition knew that would not be enough. After all, in 1996-97 Milosevic had survived three months of large demonstrations. So they called for a general strike. And they appealed to all the citizens of Serbia to come to Belgrade on Thursday October 5, for the demonstration to end all demonstrations.</p> <p>The general strike was very patchy at first. But in one central place it took hold: in the great opencast coalfields of Kolubara, some 30 miles south of Belgrade, which provide the fuel to generate more than half of Serbia's electricity. It was inevitably compared to the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, birthplace of the Polish revolution in 1980. Here, as there, one of the massive fortresses of communist industrialisation - some 17,500 people are employed in the Kolubara complex - was finally turning against its makers. Here, as there, a vital role was played by the more skilled workers and technical staff, who had connections to the democratic opposition: the semiconductors of revolution. People like Alexander Karic, a 36-year-old engineer who was dubbed the Lech Walesa of Kolubara. \"But there are many Lech Walesas,\" he said. \"We are all Lech Walesas.\"</p> <p>Sitting in a cafe, he wore blue overalls and a bright orange baseball cap proclaiming \"1+1=2\" - the slogan of Orwell's hero in 1984. The strike at Kolubara had great symbolic significance. It increased the revolutionary momentum and broke down the barriers of fear. What followed was purely Serbian.</p> <p>Early on the morning of Thursday October 5, great columns of cars and trucks set out from provincial towns, from Cacak and Uzice, from Kragujevac and Valjevo, from the rich plains of the Vojvodina in the north and the Serbian heartland of Sumadija in the south. The convoy from Cacak, headed by its longtime opposition mayor, Velimir Ilic, had a bulldozer, an earthmover and heavy-duty trucks loaded with rocks, electric saws and, yes, guns. They literally bulldozed aside the police cars blocking the road.</p> <p>Many of those who went to Belgrade were ordinary people from opposition-controlled cities, sometimes better informed than their counterparts in the capital, because of the local independent television and radio stations, but often materially worse off than the Belgraders, and so more angry. However, among them were also former policemen and soldiers, veterans of the Serbian campaigns in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo - tough, with shaved heads and guns under their leather jackets. Men who knew how to fight, and were determined to win this day.</p> <p>From north and south, east and west, they converged on Belgrade. They joined with the Belgraders who had come out in hundreds of thousands, further infuriated by the latest absurd verdict of the constitutional court, which declared the presidential election null and void. So there they stood, massed with flags, and whistles, and banners which read \"He's Finished\", in front of the impressive parliament building where the Federal Election Commission was also based.</p> <p>It was three o'clock - deadline for the revolution. Then it was just past three, and someone in the crowd turned to Professor Zarko Korac, a member of the opposition leadership which had set the deadline, and said: \"Well, professor, it's seven past...\"</p> <p>No one knew what would happen next. Or did they? What happened between about three and seven o'clock on the afternoon of October 5 changed everything. Led by a man in a red shirt, defying police batons and tear gas, a crowd stormed the parliament. Soon thereafter, the nearby state television headquarters was trashed and set alight. A handful of other key media outlets, including the state television studio and transmission centre and the formerly independent B92 radio station, seized at the start of the Kosovo war, were more peacefully taken over. Kostunica cried, \"Good evening, liberated Serbia\", to an ecstatic crowd, and they celebrated in the streets.</p> <p>These events invite a moment's reflection on the relationship between image and reality. Those who stormed the parliament created an unforgettable image of liberation - an image that CNN and the BBC sent around the world. This image then became reality. Taking over the state television was itself another compelling television image: the \"TV Bastille\" in flames. But it also meant that the opposition now controlled the place that made the images. And that, not the army or police, is the very heart of power in modern politics.</p> <p>I remember Jacek Kuron, the Polish opposition leader, saying in Warsaw in 1989 that if he had to choose between controlling the secret police and television, he would choose television. Our democracies are television democracies. Milosevic's dictatorship was a television dictatorship. And television was equally central to the revolution. This was a coup de theatre that had the effect of a coup d'etat . Who was responsible for it?</p> <p>I collected at least a dozen eyewitness accounts of the storming of the parliament, and they differ greatly. Success has many fathers. The ranks of those who did the heroic deed, or planned it, grow like relics of the true cross. About such events, the whole, exact, and sober truth will never be known but there is ample evidence that, besides much spontaneity, there was a strong component of deliberately planned, revolutionary seizure of power.</p> <p>Velimir Ilic, the mayor of Cacak, described to me how he and his group prepared their trip to Belgrade as if it were a military operation. When I asked one of his vanguard, a burly former paratrooper from the elite 63rd Parachute Regiment, what the object of the operation was, he said crisply: \"That Vojislav Kostunica should appear on state television at 7:30pm.\"</p> <p>Before they left, Ilic told them: \"Today, we will be free or die.\"</p> <p>There is doubtless some retrospective self-glorification in these accounts, but other witnesses agree that the boys from Cacak were there in the front line, and well equipped to fight the police. A Belgrade friend who was there recalls a youth of 15 or 16 standing before the parliament and taunting the crowd: \"Do you people from Belgrade need us from Cacak to show you how to take your own town hall?\"</p> <p>Cacak was not alone; there were many angry men from other provincial towns. When the first, heavy waves of tear gas were launched by the police, the intelligentsia of Belgrade mostly fled to nearby apartments, or offices, or cafes. Another friend met an acquaintance who said: \"This is the biggest funeral ever.\" She thought the rising was defeated. But the hard men from the provinces came back into the square. They had no nearby apartments to go to, and they were here to finish the job.</p> <p>The honour of Belgrade was saved by fans of the city's leading soccer club, Red Star. They were, by all accounts, also fighting in the front line. They had practised already in their soccer stadium, taunting the police with chants of \"Save Serbia, Kill Yourself Slobodan\". And they knew all about police tactics. Afterwards, the new mayor of Belgrade, Milan St Protic, thanked them for their heroic role. It must be the only time that a city mayor has thanked his soccer hooligans for going on the rampage.</p> <p>There are dozens more pieces of the jigsaw to fit into place: retrospective claim and counterclaim about planned and spontaneous action. But the essential point is established. There was, after Serbia's 1989 and its 1980, a brief moment of 1917: a deliberate yet limited use of revolutionary violence. But the remarkable thing is how limited it was, and how quickly the country returned to new-style, peaceful revolution.</p> <p>The question remains why the army, and the powerful police and state security special forces built up under Milosevic, did not intervene, instead leaving the ordinary police to throw some tear gas and then give up. For those forces, well-equipped and battle-hardened, could easily have caused a bloodbath in central Belgrade - although it would probably only have precipitated a far bloodier end of the regime.</p> <p>Here we enter the murkiest waters. Among the claims made about the army are that its chief, General Pavkovic, previously known as an arch-ally of Milosevic, refused to order his tanks to roll; or, rather more plausibly, that, on consulting with his senior commanders, Pavkovic discovered that they were not willing to risk using their largely conscripted forces against their own people. Zoran Djindjic, the Democratic Party leader, told me that the feared \"red berets\", formally the Special Operations Unit of the State Security Service under the Serbian Interior Ministry, received a direct order to bomb and retake the parliament and television. They did not carry out the order. Instead, two days later, those same \"red berets\", commanded by one General \"Legend\" Zemovic (recognisable by the red rose tattooed on the back of his neck), took over the Interior Ministry for - or at least, in cahoots with - Djindjic.</p> <p>Belgrade being Belgrade, there are even darker speculations. For as long as I have been travelling here, people have been telling me fantastic tales about conspiracies - internal, but also western, especially American ones. This is the world capital of conspiracy theories. But in this case, I think there may just be some truth in them.</p> <p>The speculation is that disaffected former members of the army, secret police and special forces, who had earlier been wondering about trying to overthrow Milosevic, now helped to ensure that he was misinformed and that the forces were unresponsive. In the case of the army, there is little secret.</p> <p>Two very senior former Milosevic generals, Momcilo Perisic (dismissed as chief of staff in 1998) and Vuk Obradovic, were now leaders of the opposition, and had publicly and privately appealed to their former comrades not to act against the people. But the most important figure mentioned is the former secret police chief, Jovica Stanisic, who was fired by Milosevic in 1998, but is still believed to wield much influence on those shadowy Belgrade frontiers where secret police, paramilitaries, businessmen, politicians and mafia-style gangsters intermingle.</p> <p>The motives of such men in the shadows? First, \"just to screw Milosevic\", as the political analyst Bratislav Grubacic put it to me. Those that Milosevic used and then cast aside were taking their revenge. Second, as a source once close to Milosevic explained: \"To save their lives. And their money - you know, a lot of money. Perhaps to keep their freedom too.\"</p> <p>I was struck by the fact that when I asked Djindjic why there was not a popular march on the secret police headquarters, like the East German storming of the Stasi, he hastily replied: \"No, we think there is valuable equipment there, which every state would need.\"</p> <p>This is all, I repeat, no more than informed speculation. But Belgrade is a city where people do have the most curious connections. And something more than just the patriotic restraint of the armed forces, and the velvet power of peaceful popular protest, does seem to be required to explain the absence of any serious attempt at repression.</p> <p>On that afternoon of October 5, one woman was crushed under the wheels of a truck. An old man died of a heart attack. The chief editor of state television and a number of policemen and demonstrators were beaten up. There are unconfirmed reports of two police deaths. That was about it. Little short of a miracle in a country still ostensibly ruled by Milosevic, and stashed full of guns and men well accustomed to using them.</p> <p>\u0095 Timothy Garton Ash is the author of History of the Present: Essays, Sketches and Dispatches from Europe in the 1990s (Penguin).

Alfred Page, now 12, survived but the fire stripped the skin from 70% of his body. He will be permanently scarred. A 12-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, went on trial at Southwark crown court, in south London, charged with causing grievous bodily harm with intent. The jury heard that the boys had been playing with home-made petrol bombs in the woods near Gillingham, Kent. They had been throwing bottles filled with fuel and sealed with rags. The alleged attack took place as Alfred, known as Podge, was climbing a fence in the company of the defendant and three other boys, in May this year. Prosecution counsel Robin Johnson said one of the boys, told police that Alfred and the defendant had been arguing by the fence. \"He heard the words 'it's dripping off me. It's running down me'.\" The witness described seeing Alfred being set alight by the defendant, using a cigarette lighter. \"Then he saw Podge being engulfed in flames. (The defendant) was laughing and then ran away.\" The witness sent another boy to phone for an ambulance and tried to pat the flames out, burning himself as he did so. \"(Alfred) said he felt stiff, and his skin was cracking.\" All of his clothes had been burned off. Metal buttons from his clothing were burning into his skin and his friend tried to pick them off. The witness tried to lift his friend up but was in such shock that he kept vomiting. The two children went to a social club where an adult onlooker saw Alfred \"walking straight-legged in a zombie style\" to the ambulance, draped in a friend's coat. By this time, the defendant had run to the home of Alfred's aunt Debbie, knocking on her door and telling her: \"Can you go and get Podgy. He's on fire.\" The defendant then went to Alfred's home, the court heard, and told his sister Marsha that \"Podgy\" was on fire. Mr Johnson said: \"He said interestingly 'someone just chucked petrol over him'. \"That is significant... because (the defendant) said the whole thing was an accident and there wasn't any question of anyone chucking petrol over Alfred.\" The young defendant, who looked confused as he sat beside his mother, claims Alfred caught his trousers on the fence and asked him to burn off the snagged material. He told police: \"All of a sudden big flames went whoomph. The boys said Podgy is on fire.\" Earlier that day some of the boys, including Alfred, had been playing with petrol bombs until their faces were black and they reeked of petrol. They were returning to the woods with more bombs made in the garage of the defendant's home and concealed under their jumpers, the court heard. Mr Johnson said the group of five boys were probably all carrying bombs. The jury was told that the defendant has admitted a charge of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm. He denies causing grievous bodily harm with intent, and another charge of unlawfully causing grievous bodily harm. Mr Johnson told the jury that they had to decide whether it was \"a childish prank or actually intended to do him grievous bodily harm\". The judge and barristers in the trial are sitting without wigs or gowns while the number of reporters in court has been restricted to avoid intimidating the young defendant. Alfred has undergone extensive surgery to replace his lost skin with grafts and was not in court. The trial continues.",

      "bodyText": "Three boys pointed a fake gun at the head of a millionaire and robbed him of \u00a3400 in a raid planned between school lessons, a Manchester court heard yesterday. John Reynard was attacked at his \u00a3750,000 mansion near Middleton, in Manchester, in February by the schoolboys, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Detectives discovered that other boys from the school had been unwittingly recruited to help make a fake police warrant card so they could trick their way into Mr Reynard's home. Three boys, aged 16 and 17 pleaded guilty to robbery when they appeared at Minshull Street crown court. A 17-year-old admitted assisting an offender and handling \u00a320 stolen in the robbery. A fifth sixth former is accused of supplying a gun to the other boys. He denies aiding and abetting the robbery and is on trial. Kate Blackwell, for the prosecution, said it was a bizarre and unusual case hatched against a background of bravado. One of the boys, known as child B, told the court: \"We started talking about the robbery in my classroom. We had heard from other people that this man kept large sums of money in his house. The idea was to break in. But we heard he has people there protecting the house. \"We initially thought about getting a knife, but then thought if there was a break in and there was a struggle, someone might get seriously hurt. So we decided we would get a toy gun instead.\" Mr Reynard, who was not in court, said in a statement: \"Though this incident frightened me, I got the impression the thieves were amateurish and clueless.\" The trial continues.",

The members of the cross-party committee, all appointed by the prime minister, say MI5 and MI6 should adopt even stricter vetting procedures than those they are already planning. There should be more interviews of serving officers in their own homes, as part of the positive vetting process, to detect \"lifestyle mismatches and the possession of unexplained wealth\", says the committee. It also makes clear that MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, as well as the Defence Intelligence Staff, are not doing enough to fight organised crime, including drug traffickers and illegal immigration rings. \"The briefest study of Dover and Heathrow reveals immediately how fragile our present defences are, and without intelligence they would be virtually non-existent,\" Mr King tells Tony Blair in his introduction to the report.

As his behaviour deteriorates, he abandons his writing and takes up instead with a local woman, who may or may not be a prostitute, before falling in love with a dog. </p> <p>So far did the film stray from the Soviet-era glorification of Russia's classical writers on film that the committee tried to block it. Only a last-minute intervention from the film minister, who loved the script, saved the project and provided the necessary funding. </p> <p>Since its premiere in Moscow last month, His Wife's Diary has been hailed as the most important film to come out of Russia this year and has been put forward as the country's entry for the best foreign film Oscar. Dunya Smirnova's screenplay has already won an award at the American Hartley-Merrill international screenwriting competition. </p> <p>But loud voices in the Russian press have also expressed outrage at the breaking of a taboo, accusing Uchitel of muckraking disrespect to the writer. A sneering review in the liberal daily newspaper Sevodnya concludes that His Wife's Diary is the inevitable first step down a slippery slope which will see the private lives of the nation's creative heroes recycled as soap operas. \"Pushkin, Dostoevsky and Tchaikovsky are next in the queue,\" writes critic Victoria Nikiforova. \"They are being transformed from classical writers into pop stars.\" Another critic warns: \"Many will no doubt be shocked by the themes in this film.\" </p> <p>Uchitel was bemused by their response, explaining: \"The finance commission voted to turn it down - objecting to what they described as hanging out the dirty linen of a great man. They asked, 'Was it really necessary to touch on this side of him? Did you have to drag out the details of his love life? Do viewers really need to see this?' I was astonished. I thought that era was long over. </p> <p>\"A lot of the people on the committee - made up of film directors and scriptwriters as well as civil servants - have been working in the film ministry for 30 or 40 years and their thinking was guided by an old Soviet mentality. There was a great tradition of Soviet biographical films, where if they mentioned the hero's private life at all, they would portray everything as wonderful. The committee saw Bunin as an icon who shouldn't be touched.\" </p> <p>From a western perspective, it is indeed hard to see what the fuss was about. Far from being a tabloid expos\u00e9, this is a sensitive account of the emotions that overwhelmed the writer in his last years, loosely based on documentary evidence from Bunin's memoirs and the diary kept by his wife, Vera, as a form of escapism. Bunin's Nobel prize in 1933, the onset of the second world war, unsettling reports from Stalin's new regime in the Soviet Union - all these are background events, overshadowed by the writer's infatuation with the young poet Galina Plotnikova (actually Galina Kuznetsova, whose name has been changed to spare the feelings of surviving relatives). She arrives as Bunin's student, but remains his lover until abandoning him for another woman, the singer Marga Kovtun. Meanwhile his wife is wooed by another \u00e9migr\u00e9 Russian writer. </p> <p>After a French co-production deal fell through (mainly, Uchitel says, because it came with the bizarre condition that Omar Sharif should play the lead), the film was beautifully shot in the run-down, seaside towns and villas of the Crimea, convincingly transformed into a pre-war Cote d'Azur. The film shows Bunin in his 60s and 70s, when he was writing his last volume of stories, Dark Alleys - all of which focus on love and most of which end unhappily. Published in Paris in 1946, the stories were dismissed by many of his readers as sordid accounts of sexual encounters. </p> <p>Uchitel argues that far from providing his viewers with gratuitous sensationalism, he is offering them an insight into the experiences that inspired this work. \"You need to show how someone lives, what kind of stresses they are experiencing, what kind of romantic drama they are caught up in. Only then do you begin to understand that the writer did not simply sit down at his desk and dream up these wonderful stories. Those old films that showed the writer as utterly happy, his life very tidy, were so stupid. You need to show that his creation only came about because of the life he was living.\" </p> <p>Nevertheless, Uchitel clearly has some residual guilt about his treatment of Bunin. Both he and the actor Andrei Smirnov, who plays the lead role, plan to visit the writer's grave in France - to ask his forgiveness. </p> <p> \u0095 His Wife's Diary is screened in the Regus London film festival next Friday at 6.15pm and November 11 at 4pm.

She arrives as Bunin's student, but remains his lover until abandoning him for another woman, the singer Marga Kovtun. Meanwhile his wife is wooed by another \u00e9migr\u00e9 Russian writer. After a French co-production deal fell through (mainly, Uchitel says, because it came with the bizarre condition that Omar Sharif should play the lead), the film was beautifully shot in the run-down, seaside towns and villas of the Crimea, convincingly transformed into a pre-war Cote d'Azur. The film shows Bunin in his 60s and 70s, when he was writing his last volume of stories, Dark Alleys - all of which focus on love and most of which end unhappily. Published in Paris in 1946, the stories were dismissed by many of his readers as sordid accounts of sexual encounters. Uchitel argues that far from providing his viewers with gratuitous sensationalism, he is offering them an insight into the experiences that inspired this work. \"You need to show how someone lives, what kind of stresses they are experiencing, what kind of romantic drama they are caught up in. Only then do you begin to understand that the writer did not simply sit down at his desk and dream up these wonderful stories. Those old films that showed the writer as utterly happy, his life very tidy, were so stupid. You need to show that his creation only came about because of the life he was living.\" Nevertheless, Uchitel clearly has some residual guilt about his treatment of Bunin. Both he and the actor Andrei Smirnov, who plays the lead role, plan to visit the writer's grave in France - to ask his forgiveness. \u0095 His Wife's Diary is screened in the Regus London film festival next Friday at 6.15pm and November 11 at 4pm.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I first met Anita Page in 1994, at a party in Beverly Hills. She sounded like Mae West and, in a long blonde wig, looked like a cross between Baby Jane Hudson and Barbara Cartland. She appeared uninterested in everyday life. All she really cared about was her Hollywood heyday, the era of the first talkies. She couldn't believe her fame had gone. </p> <p>A couple of years later, my brother and I began making a film about early Hollywood and got to know her rather better. She lives the life of Norma Desmond, rising at noon, when one of her assistants gets her dressed for the day ahead. Her wardrobe largely consists of remodelled dresses she wore in the 20s, to which she will add accessories once bought by male suitors. The furs are all a little moth-eaten, her long fingernails look like scarlet talons. The remainder of the day she spends watching herself in old movies. In her own mind, there is only ever one real star. The most famous, the most sought after Anita Page. </p> <p>She phones about once a month now to ask what we are up to, and to tell me of her latest projects (although she is in her 90s, she still acts, but not in movies that many will see) and what she and her entourage - a ragbag of assistants, nurses and hangers-on - are doing. She lives between her two houses in Pasadena and Beverly Hills, and says she wants to come to England and take the Eurostar to Paris. </p> <p>Listening to her is like listening to a radio that slips between frequencies, but her recollection of her movie career is crystal clear. She gossips to me about her rivalry with Garbo, who pushed her into second place in a most popular actress poll in 1929, and her hatred of Joan Crawford, with whom she starred Our Dancing Daughters in 1928. And about the parties she attended at William Randolph Hearst's mansion, San Simeon, with William Powell, Jean Harlow, Buster Keaton, Norma Talmadge and Marlene Dietrich. </p> <p>In one of our conversations, in 1998, she mentioned another name to me. \"I knew so many nice men,\" she said. \"I knew Mussolini. He used to write to me.\" Although she had told me many extraordinary stories, she had never before mentioned the Italian dictator. I pressed her further, she was not prepared to say more and I wrote it off as being too difficult, or inconsequential, for her to recall. </p> <p>Two weeks ago, however, I received another phone call. As usual when she rings me, it was 2am in the UK and I was asleep. The television was on full volume in the Californian background. \"Have I gotten you up,\" she asked. \"Yes,\" I said. \"There is a German woman on my TV.\" It was Leni Riefenstahl, in the news for a press conference she had given at the Frankfurt Book Fair to publicise a new biography. \"She knew a friend of mine in Italy.\" </p> <p>She went on: \"Leni was an intimate friend of Adolf Hitler, or so they say.\" She talked about Riefenstahl as if they were once rivals, though in fact they were worlds apart. Where Riefenstahl was making propaganda films for the Nazi leadership, Page was a hedonist whose principal concern was finding the next glass of champagne. </p> <p>I asked her why she is interested in the 98-year-old German film-maker. \"Well, it is just that Leni had Hitler and I had Mussolini. Maybe Leni and I should get together, you know, girls comparing notes.\" She laughed. \"I got the sweetest letters from Mussolini, real nice.\" And she started to tell me about the day they began to arrive - and about how, in the end, they would contribute to her being dropped by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. </p> <p>Anita Page, born Anita Pomares, signed for MGM in 1928. During the tail end of the silent era, she starred in a number of hit films, including Telling the World, While the City Sleeps and Our Modern Maidens. Broadway Melody, which was the first all-sound movie, won the best picture Oscar in 1929. \"I took MGM into the sound era,\" she takes great pride in telling me, \"and made them a huge buck.\" </p> <p>She specialised in playing amoral, hard-drinking floozies. That, combined with her looks, brought her a string of male admirers. She dated Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers, Douglas Fairbanks Jr, Prince Louis Ferdinand and Clark Gable, who wrote of Page: \"She was a unique beauty. When I worked with Grace Kelly and looked into her eyes I remembered Anita Page.\" And she received bags and bags of correspondence. </p> <p>\"Between movies I signed fan mail,\" she said. \"Or I modelled, or went on publicity tours. I received so much fan mail.\" To cope with it, she hired help in the form of her mother, Helen Pomares. She employed her father, John, as a chauffeur and her brother Mario as her gym instructor. \"I loved my family and they loved me right back,\" she said. </p> <p>But Anita would still open some of her own mail. She recalls finding the first letter from Mussolini in mid-1929. \"I was so excited. I was so thrilled, to open this beautiful adoring letter,\" she said. A second followed, which was opened by her secretary. Recognising the handwriting, Anita opened a third. </p> <p>In one week, Page found eight letters from Mussolini. Where other fans just asked for an autograph, Page says Mussolini's missives were more obsessive, more those of a connoisseur. As well as detailing every move she made in the film, he enclosed pictures of himself and begged her for a signed portrait in return. \"Oh, honey, his letters were so gooey, so sweet and actually so touching. He obviously loved what he saw on the screen - me.\" </p> <p>What did Mussolini actually write? </p> <p>\"Well, you English and Europeans are so romantic. I think Ram\u00f3n Navarro said, 'Why kiss the hand when the lips are in view?' I'm trying to think now what Mussolini said about my hands. </p> <p>\"He liked the films first, then me. Or maybe my appearance in the films made him want to watch them in the first place. My hair seemed to be a big deal - it may have seemed messy, but that was the look. He even wanted a slice of it once. I remember my mother wanted to send him a picture of me playing tennis. She may well have done - mother sent all sorts of pictures to my fans. My mother and father had to come over and put my photos in envelopes, you know, people wanted to own a part of me, I was big!\" </p> <p>Anita's mother kept a keen eye on Page's male suitors. She vetted them heavily, separating the eligible from undesirables such as Ram\u00f3n Navarro and William Haines - both known homosexuals. Each offered Anita their hand in marriage, but Pomares refused them. </p> <p>MGM was tolerant of Anita's flings, up to a point. But the studio's vice president, Irving Thalberg, was in love with Page and often made his feelings very clear. \"He like me to call him Daddy,\" she says. \"Nothing happened. I said to Irving, 'Admire me from afar, darling, and that will be just fine for the both of us.'\" Thalberg was married to the actress Norma Shearer at the time. </p> <p>Page had other problems with her studio bosses. Her rivalry with the sexually voracious Joan Crawford caused increasing tension at MGM. \"I ended up loathing Joan,\" says Page. \"For one thing she tried to hit on me several times. Let me tell you, when my mother saw the sex aids in various shapes and colours that Joan kept in her medicine cabinet, she refused my ever seeing Joan again - apart from on a film set.\" </p> <p>When the studio learnt that piles of letters were arriving from Mussolini simply addressed to \"Film star Anita Page, MGM Hollywood\", they started to get nervous. In part, says Page, this was because of Thalberg. \"Irving was jealous of any attention,\" she says. \"Of that I am certain.\" She says he refused to give her the role of Red Andrews in Red-Headed Woman (1932) because she wouldn't have sex with him. \"He kept saying to me, 'The film is yours but what are you going to do for Daddy?' I saw his manhood was growing in his pants. I became uneasy, as I turned and walked out of his office I knew I would not get the picture.\" </p> <p>She recalls a furious Thalberg reading out one of Mussolini's letters to her. \"I asked him, 'Why are you so mad?' I am a famous movie star at your studio and have an enormous worldwide following. I didn't think it so odd that someone like theItalian should love me.\" </p> <p>Studio head Louis B Mayer thought it would be a mistake to leak even a hint of information about Mussolini's love letters. Frightened of a scandal, Mayer ordered Page not to respond. Even sending him a signed portrait was strictly forbidden. </p> <p>Then another letter arrived at MGM from Mussolini thanking Anita for a signed print of her by the celebrity photographer George Hurrell. As she often did, Anita's mother had forged Page's sig nature. The star and her mother were called into Mayer's office where he and Thalberg questioned them about the thankyou note. Mrs Pomares said that a fan is a fan and her daughter never said no to a request, especially from such a prominent foreigner. </p> <p>\"Oh brother, I think Mussolini thought I'd opened the door into my affections. He wrote of my gorgeous lips and my hands.\" He also sent her gifts - she remembers perfume and a food parcel - but MGM sent them back with typed notes saying thanks, but no thanks. </p> <p>I ask Anita if she still had any copies of the letters. She said she would look. </p> <p>Over the next four evenings I telephone to try to establish if anyone in the house has located Mussolini's letters. Randy Malone is Anita's number one assistant and also notable for his appearances on the American TV show Singled Out, where he dresses in drag and mimics Hollywood actors. Malone was a teenager when he first met Anita at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Over the years their relationship has gone from strength to strength. Although he is gay, Anita has proposed to him dozens of times. </p> <p>The rest of the Page household consists of a nurse called Carol and a small crowd of gay men, all jobbing actors and all infatuated with Page. </p> <p>The house has been turned upside-down. Randy has organised a search party. The former child actress Margaret O'Brien, now in her 60s and another of Anita's entourage, has joined in. Randy whispers to me that he has to keep Margaret and Anita apart, as they are jealous of each other for spending time with him. Margaret has also asked Randy to marry him. Randy's partner, Mickey, is apparently unaware of the actress's feelings. </p> <p>In 1934, Anita married Nacio Herb Brown, but the marriage was short-lived. Two years after they divorced, Anita met and married an American admiral, Hershal House. They had two daughters, Sarah and Linda. Linda, who is an artist who also runs an escort agency, is in daily contact with Anita and her assistants. </p> <p>It is Linda who calls me next. She is visiting the house to help locate the letters. \"Mother is so pleased to talk to you,\" she says. \"She loves England. I'm helping the cause here right now. I did see one of the photographs Mussolini sent her in the old house, but since she has been here with Randy I haven't seen it.\" </p> <p>Like her mother, Linda lives in a time warp. In the 60s Linda's looks were reminiscent of Jayne Mansfield's. Today, at almost 60, she wears her hot pants bright and extremely tight. Her platinum wig has seen so much hairspray over the years that the strands are clumped together in a sticky mess. Her make-up is heavy and her eyelashes extremely long. </p> <p>I ask Linda why Mussolini fell for Anita over so many other movie stars. \"Stop there, honey,\" Linda says. \"Mussolini wrote to mom because quite simply she is beautiful. I say this because she still has her looks. Yes, they are still there, she like fell into the fountain of youth. You remember when you came out here to see mom and took her picture with a flash gun in your camera. Well, she didn't blink once. Now how's that for a star. She never went in for much make-up either; Constance Bennett hated her for that. Constance detested natural beauty like mom's. I have been blessed with mom's good looks too. How fortunate am I?\" </p> <p>I try to get Linda back on track: \"Did Mussolini write about how attractive he found Anita?\" </p> <p>Linda goes quiet on the end of the phone. \"Let's think. His letters had little or no formalities to them; he addressed her as his darling sweetheart dearest and called her talented and tremendous. Honey, Mussolini had it bad. He detailed every move she made in the movies he saw her in. He commented on every twist and turn she made. I personally think he liked the fact that mom was so vital. I mean she did all her own stunts, fell down flights of stairs... she could sing, too. She still does. Anita did all kinds of stuff. Mom was a beauty, yes, but I think he saw her being gutsy, too. I think I'm right in saying that Broadway Melody was his favourite. Later on when Mussolini hooked up with Hitler, Grandma Pomares got upset and felt guilty about the time she pretended to be Anita. </p> <p>\"Mom never spoke about Mussolini to my daddy [Hershal House]. Actually she didn't mention Mussolini at all until recently. It's too bad that Randy and the boys couldn't locate anything he wrote to Anita for you to read... </p> <p>\"What else can I tell you? Mussolini wrote in longhand and had pretty good penmanship. His English was all over the place but that didn't matter; the essence came through. The letter I read was quite tame, although mom did say he wrote of her bosom on one occasion. Isn't it crazy that my mom got stuff like that from Mussolini? Oh, he also wrote in green ink. I have to say that mom had no idea of what kind of man Mussolini was or how he treated his people.\" </p> <p>Anita's posse keeps her isolated from the real world. My interest in her correspondence with Mussolini has fired their egos. Each inhabitant has his or her own motive for hanging out at the Page house. All of them want to be in the movies. </p> <p>I have received five phone calls in one evening. It appears Anita is getting irritated with the contents of drawers and cupboards being scattered about the floor. Randy has found a solution. \"We have all told Anita that she is going to a premiere so she is now upstairs in the back room all dressed up watching herself and Buster Keaton in Free and Easy (1930). We will dig up the back yard if we have to, but we can't find anything yet.\" </p> <p>Getting desperate for hard evidence, I contact a former MGM secretary named Buck, in case he can throw any light on the Mussolini ephemera. \"Gee, that was some time ago,\" he says. \"I remember how mad Mayer got with Anita and her mother. He could handle her feud with Joan Crawford but found Anita's other baggage an irritation. When Anita's mother was sending that stuff to Mussolini, that was really the last straw for those two.\" I ask him if he ever sees Anita. \"Are you kidding? She's out every night. The big guy [Randy] gets invites to all the parties in town, even the Oscars. When they're out all dressed up they look like the Addams Family at Christmas and in full Technicolor.\" </p> <p>Next I turn to actress Marion Shilling. Page's junior by several years, she knows Anita from her MGM days - and afterwards, when the pair freelanced at minor studios in Hollywood. </p> <p>\"I was invited to Anita's 21st birthday party at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel,\" she recalls. \"It was a big party - Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, William Haines, Lili Damita and William Powell were there. Her date was Robert Young, she wore this frilly dress - pink, I think. </p> <p>\"Robert seemed a bit nervous: he stood on the dance floor, rigid, while Anita danced around the floor like a wild cat. She told Mona Rico and I about getting six letters from a gentleman called Mussolini. I only remembered the story when the war broke out and you heard about him and Hitler. I didn't think she knew who Mussolini was, though of course she knew he was important and most of all he hadn't sent a letter to Joan Crawford, so Anita was one up on her. It is strange how memories come flooding back. </p> <p>\"To Anita, fame was everything. I see her out at parties now. The poor darling, she's still on stage and cannot let go of the fact that she was once a star. But she was always charming to me and extremely well-liked on set.\" </p> <p>Finally I call the actor David Rollins, an other contemporary of Anita's at MGM. He too remembers the fuss over Mussolini. \"She was pretty open about telling everyone that Mussolini was in love with her. Basically I don't think she realised who he was. Until 1933, few people really knew who he was in the States. But Anita knew he was important enough to make a big fuss over the fan mail.\" He remembers Thalberg being so annoyed that Anita wouldn't go with him that he would have done anything to get rid of her at this point. \"What better way of getting rid of her than this stuff?\" </p> <p>A combination of events led to an end to the letters. MGM had done well out of Anita Page's movies, but she was increasingly being asked to pose for risqu\u00e9 photographs showing her in revealing gowns, and she baulked at the studio's request that she appear in public with men they picked for her. When she complained to Mayer about her treatment and asked for a pay increase, he flatly refused. Mayer bragged that he could make Page shine in three pictures - and that he could break Garbo in the same number. Mayer knew Anita had turned Thalberg down. He punished her by loaning her out to other studios for the remainder of her contract at MGM. </p> <p>Anita says: \"I'm sure where I feared to tread Joan Crawford, Constance Bennett and maybe even Jean Harlow didn't give it a second thought. Joan called him Papa. Irving was obviously so mad with me he ruined my career.\" </p> <p>After Anita left MGM in 1932 she did a series of tests for Fox and it appeared she would be offered a contract. Later she learned that the head of Fox had lunch with Mayer the day she was called to sign a contract, and the contract never materialised. Anita thought after she left MGM that Mussolini had given up on her too, but later she discovered over a four-year period that her mother had sent Mussolini a further 20 autographed pictures that she had signed. A mailroom employee at MGM told her that he sent her more than 100 letters. </p> <p>\"I never met Mussolini,\" she says, \"though I sure would have liked to. Honey I'm not saying that I'd have married him.\" She says he asked her twice. \"My father never liked the whole business. When my brother said he was frightened in case Mussolini came over and kidnapped me, father reassured us that Mussolini wouldn't get as far as Beverly Hills before being noticed. </p> <p>\"Mussolini may have liked me and I know I was real pleased with all the attention but really I think he was a bit of a pig. After all, his people were not allowed freedom. People should be able to speak their minds. If he wrote to me today I would tell him that people should see films, going to see a film opens your mind and gets you thinking. They give you inspiration. I hope I entertained and inspired someone.\" </p> <p>A few nights later I received another call from the house. Still nothing had surfaced. It seems unlikely now that anything will.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I first met Anita Page in 1994, at a party in Beverly Hills. She sounded like Mae West and, in a long blonde wig, looked like a cross between Baby Jane Hudson and Barbara Cartland. She appeared uninterested in everyday life. All she really cared about was her Hollywood heyday, the era of the first talkies. She couldn't believe her fame had gone. A couple of years later, my brother and I began making a film about early Hollywood and got to know her rather better. She lives the life of Norma Desmond, rising at noon, when one of her assistants gets her dressed for the day ahead. Her wardrobe largely consists of remodelled dresses she wore in the 20s, to which she will add accessories once bought by male suitors. The furs are all a little moth-eaten, her long fingernails look like scarlet talons. The remainder of the day she spends watching herself in old movies. In her own mind, there is only ever one real star. The most famous, the most sought after Anita Page. She phones about once a month now to ask what we are up to, and to tell me of her latest projects (although she is in her 90s, she still acts, but not in movies that many will see) and what she and her entourage - a ragbag of assistants, nurses and hangers-on - are doing. She lives between her two houses in Pasadena and Beverly Hills, and says she wants to come to England and take the Eurostar to Paris. Listening to her is like listening to a radio that slips between frequencies, but her recollection of her movie career is crystal clear. She gossips to me about her rivalry with Garbo, who pushed her into second place in a most popular actress poll in 1929, and her hatred of Joan Crawford, with whom she starred Our Dancing Daughters in 1928. And about the parties she attended at William Randolph Hearst's mansion, San Simeon, with William Powell, Jean Harlow, Buster Keaton, Norma Talmadge and Marlene Dietrich. In one of our conversations, in 1998, she mentioned another name to me. \"I knew so many nice men,\" she said. \"I knew Mussolini. He used to write to me.\" Although she had told me many extraordinary stories, she had never before mentioned the Italian dictator. I pressed her further, she was not prepared to say more and I wrote it off as being too difficult, or inconsequential, for her to recall. Two weeks ago, however, I received another phone call. As usual when she rings me, it was 2am in the UK and I was asleep. The television was on full volume in the Californian background. \"Have I gotten you up,\" she asked. \"Yes,\" I said. \"There is a German woman on my TV.\" It was Leni Riefenstahl, in the news for a press conference she had given at the Frankfurt Book Fair to publicise a new biography. \"She knew a friend of mine in Italy.\" She went on: \"Leni was an intimate friend of Adolf Hitler, or so they say.\" She talked about Riefenstahl as if they were once rivals, though in fact they were worlds apart. Where Riefenstahl was making propaganda films for the Nazi leadership, Page was a hedonist whose principal concern was finding the next glass of champagne. I asked her why she is interested in the 98-year-old German film-maker. \"Well, it is just that Leni had Hitler and I had Mussolini. Maybe Leni and I should get together, you know, girls comparing notes.\" She laughed. \"I got the sweetest letters from Mussolini, real nice.\" And she started to tell me about the day they began to arrive - and about how, in the end, they would contribute to her being dropped by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Anita Page, born Anita Pomares, signed for MGM in 1928. During the tail end of the silent era, she starred in a number of hit films, including Telling the World, While the City Sleeps and Our Modern Maidens. Broadway Melody, which was the first all-sound movie, won the best picture Oscar in 1929. \"I took MGM into the sound era,\" she takes great pride in telling me, \"and made them a huge buck.\" She specialised in playing amoral, hard-drinking floozies. That, combined with her looks, brought her a string of male admirers. She dated Charles \"Buddy\" Rogers, Douglas Fairbanks Jr, Prince Louis Ferdinand and Clark Gable, who wrote of Page: \"She was a unique beauty. When I worked with Grace Kelly and looked into her eyes I remembered Anita Page.\" And she received bags and bags of correspondence. \"Between movies I signed fan mail,\" she said. \"Or I modelled, or went on publicity tours. I received so much fan mail.\" To cope with it, she hired help in the form of her mother, Helen Pomares. She employed her father, John, as a chauffeur and her brother Mario as her gym instructor. \"I loved my family and they loved me right back,\" she said. But Anita would still open some of her own mail. She recalls finding the first letter from Mussolini in mid-1929. \"I was so excited. I was so thrilled, to open this beautiful adoring letter,\" she said. A second followed, which was opened by her secretary. Recognising the handwriting, Anita opened a third. In one week, Page found eight letters from Mussolini. Where other fans just asked for an autograph, Page says Mussolini's missives were more obsessive, more those of a connoisseur. As well as detailing every move she made in the film, he enclosed pictures of himself and begged her for a signed portrait in return. \"Oh, honey, his letters were so gooey, so sweet and actually so touching. He obviously loved what he saw on the screen - me.\" What did Mussolini actually write? \"Well, you English and Europeans are so romantic. I think Ram\u00f3n Navarro said, 'Why kiss the hand when the lips are in view?' I'm trying to think now what Mussolini said about my hands. \"He liked the films first, then me. Or maybe my appearance in the films made him want to watch them in the first place. My hair seemed to be a big deal - it may have seemed messy, but that was the look. He even wanted a slice of it once. I remember my mother wanted to send him a picture of me playing tennis. She may well have done - mother sent all sorts of pictures to my fans. My mother and father had to come over and put my photos in envelopes, you know, people wanted to own a part of me, I was big!\" Anita's mother kept a keen eye on Page's male suitors. She vetted them heavily, separating the eligible from undesirables such as Ram\u00f3n Navarro and William Haines - both known homosexuals. Each offered Anita their hand in marriage, but Pomares refused them. MGM was tolerant of Anita's flings, up to a point. But the studio's vice president, Irving Thalberg, was in love with Page and often made his feelings very clear. \"He like me to call him Daddy,\" she says. \"Nothing happened. I said to Irving, 'Admire me from afar, darling, and that will be just fine for the both of us.'\" Thalberg was married to the actress Norma Shearer at the time. Page had other problems with her studio bosses. Her rivalry with the sexually voracious Joan Crawford caused increasing tension at MGM. \"I ended up loathing Joan,\" says Page. \"For one thing she tried to hit on me several times. Let me tell you, when my mother saw the sex aids in various shapes and colours that Joan kept in her medicine cabinet, she refused my ever seeing Joan again - apart from on a film set.\" When the studio learnt that piles of letters were arriving from Mussolini simply addressed to \"Film star Anita Page, MGM Hollywood\", they started to get nervous. In part, says Page, this was because of Thalberg. \"Irving was jealous of any attention,\" she says. \"Of that I am certain.\" She says he refused to give her the role of Red Andrews in Red-Headed Woman (1932) because she wouldn't have sex with him. \"He kept saying to me, 'The film is yours but what are you going to do for Daddy?' I saw his manhood was growing in his pants. I became uneasy, as I turned and walked out of his office I knew I would not get the picture.\" She recalls a furious Thalberg reading out one of Mussolini's letters to her. \"I asked him, 'Why are you so mad?' I am a famous movie star at your studio and have an enormous worldwide following. I didn't think it so odd that someone like theItalian should love me.\" Studio head Louis B Mayer thought it would be a mistake to leak even a hint of information about Mussolini's love letters. Frightened of a scandal, Mayer ordered Page not to respond. Even sending him a signed portrait was strictly forbidden.

He wrote of my gorgeous lips and my hands.\" He also sent her gifts - she remembers perfume and a food parcel - but MGM sent them back with typed notes saying thanks, but no thanks. I ask Anita if she still had any copies of the letters. She said she would look. Over the next four evenings I telephone to try to establish if anyone in the house has located Mussolini's letters. Randy Malone is Anita's number one assistant and also notable for his appearances on the American TV show Singled Out, where he dresses in drag and mimics Hollywood actors. Malone was a teenager when he first met Anita at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Over the years their relationship has gone from strength to strength. Although he is gay, Anita has proposed to him dozens of times. The rest of the Page household consists of a nurse called Carol and a small crowd of gay men, all jobbing actors and all infatuated with Page. The house has been turned upside-down.

Two years after they divorced, Anita met and married an American admiral, Hershal House. They had two daughters, Sarah and Linda. Linda, who is an artist who also runs an escort agency, is in daily contact with Anita and her assistants. It is Linda who calls me next.

      "bodyText": "Lancashire county cricket club was yesterday found guilty of direct sexual discrimination against a woman executive who was turned down for a job because her gender was seen as \"unacceptable\" to traditionalists. Maria Grant, 45, a former executive director of the Women's Cricket Association, received \u00a315,000 compensation, agreed by the Lancashire cricket board. Ms Grant had applied for the \u00a324,000 job of assistant secretary and development coordinator in July last year. She felt overqualified, but it was a step towards her goal of becoming the first woman chief executive of an English county club. She was not shortlisted, but eight men were. An employment tribunal in Manchester found the Lancashire board marked Ms Grant down in selection because traditional club members would not want meetings chaired by a woman. Announcing the panel's decision, the chairman, Peter Russell, said the criteria for selection were largely subjective and had led to bias. He said judging by the evidence of the former assistant secretary of the club, Kenneth Standring, it appeared Lancashire cricket board had failed to follow the equal opportunity guidelines set down by the England cricket board and the equal opportunities commission and that some selection committee members had not read the guidelines. Under the selection criterion of \"acadamic qualifications\", Ms Grant, who has a masters degree and is completing a PhD at Manchester University, was awarded fewer points than a man with a degree from Oxford and the same score as a man with a city and guilds qualification in auto-engineering. Mr Russell added: \"Mr Standring said, if appointed, [Ms Grant] would have to deal with some league chairmen and secretaries. That would be difficult as she was a woman ... It would be difficult disciplining people and chairing committees, as she was a woman.\" After the verdict, Ms Grant said: \"This verdict sends a clear message to sports organisations, which are made up of so-called traditional members, to examine their attitudes and policies for recruitment and employment. \"In standing up to the club, I have scuppered any chance I had of becoming the first woman to head a county cricket club.\" Lancashire county cricket club said: \"We are disappointed but we accept the decision of the tribunal with dignity ...

      "bodyText": "Voters in America's battleground states cannot turn on their television this week without exposing themselves to a bombardment of increasingly aggressive election adverts as election day nears. The George W Bush campaign may be all sweetness and light on the surface, but its latest ad accuses Al Gore of \"bending the truth\". The Gore campaign, meanwhile, has just launched a new ad which attacks Mr Bush's record in his home state, Texas, and warns that his tax cuts \"hurt the many\". But that is just the start. The real nastiness in the battle of the airwaves is waged not by the campaigns themselves, but by their surrogates; the organisations and special interest groups which say the things that the candidates desperately want said - provided it's by someone else. Yesterday, a Texas-based group called Aretino Industries began airing an ad targeting Mr Gore as weak on defence and a puppet in the hands of communist China. The commercial, which deliberately echoes a famous anti-Barry Goldwater ad from the 1964 election, shows a girl pulling the petals off a daisy as a nuclear explosion begins. \"China has the ability to threaten our homes with long range nuclear warheads,\" the commentary says, as the words \"Vote Republican\" appear on the screen. From the other side, two ads by the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People urge black American voters to support the Democrats by invoking the racial murder of James Byrd, who was dragged to his death behind a truck in Mr Bush's state two years ago. One of the ads features a pick-up truck pulling a heavy chain like the one to which Byrd was tied, with a commentary by Byrd's daughter Renee Mullins. The other, also featuring Ms Mullins but without the picture of the truck and chain, says: \"We will not be dragged away from our future. Vote on November 7. Please.\" An ad from the Reform party's presidential candidate, Pat Buchanan, is not for the faint-hearted, either. It features a mock auction in which the two main candidates are for sale. Mr Gore is bought by \"Red China\" while Mr Bush is purchased by \"the drug lobby\". At local level, the ad war has been just as fast and furious. Early research suggests that the Democrats, who have officially pledged to ban the \"soft money\" that supports the ads by independent groups, are making much greater use of the system than their Republican rivals. A New York University report this week said that pro-Democratic groups' spending on television advertising totalled more than $9m (\u00a36.2m), compared with less than $500,000 spent by pro-Republican groups. Negative campaigning of this kind is universally condemned by politicians and the public. But as long as it works - and it seems to - neither party is prepared to disarm itself of such an effective weapon.",

      "bodyText": "While the attention of the national electorate may be focused on the presidential campaign, voters in Alabama are being asked to go to the polling stations on election day to remove from their constitution a ban on inter-racial marriage, dating from the slavery era. Alabama is the last state to have such a clause on its statute books, and the campaign to remove it is generating both anger and embarrassment. A local radio station held an on-air inter-racial marriage to highlight the issue, and civil rights and Confederate heritage groups have clashed over the vote. Section 102 of the state constitution says: \"The legislature shall never pass any law to authorise or legalise any marriage between any white person and a Negro or descendant of a Negro.\" Legislators seeking to update the constitution's arcane language came across the clause, and although constitutional lawyers say it no longer has legal force, its existence is an embarrassment to those who have put the issue on the ballot. Alvin Holmes, the Democratic congressman leading the campaign, said it would be a \"black mark\" if the proposition was not passed. To draw attention to the issue Walter Peavy, a DJ on the Huntsville radio station WDJL, conducted the marriage of a mixed-race couple, Ronnie David and Amanda Holt, on air. A spokeswoman for the station said the listeners' response has been largely positive. \"It [the section of the constitution] is an embarrassment and what we were doing was giving a human face to an outdated situation.\" The campaign against the change is led by Mike Chappell of the Confederate Heritage political action committee in Montgomery. He said that about a third of the state was opposed to inter-racial marriage and the issue had enabled him to reach and activate a large pro-Confederacy constituency which he hoped would become active in other campaigns. \"A lot of people have said to me not to get involved, that the more you stir it the stinkier it gets,\" he said. \"But I can't just sit down and let it happen.

      "body": "<p>&lt;UL\"Making a little winter love in a dark corner.\" </p> <p>Ben Jonson.</p> <p> Once upon a time older folk in soaps were happy with a small port and lemon or a nice, tight perm. Not any more. I must say, between ourselves, I find it an encouraging trend. </p> <p>But there can be glitches with either passion or a nice tight perm. In <strong> Coronation Street</strong> (ITV) Fred's dream of Audrey cooking him a full English breakfast every day, always optimistic, was dashed. In <strong> EastEnders</strong> (BBC1) Pat and Frank parted with a noise like Velcro. Something about their doomed love (possibly the nicely matched size of the combatants) reminded you of the worst excesses of Wagner. \"Pat, I love you!\" \"Frank! Frank!\" And the rain bucketed down on the pair of 'em. </p> <p>The d\u00e9nouement was in the bar of The Queen Vic. This is classically correct. Nobody leaves the cast of EastEnders, usually propelled by the boot of a dear one, unless an audience of drunks is hanging on every word. It's more like a Western in this respect. As the old song goes... </p> <p> \"The doors swing in and the doors swing out </p> <p>And some pass in and others pass out.\" </p> <p>Frank, the jovial landlord of The Queen Vic, has been panting after Pat for some time, like a bloodhound eyeing a Bonio. She swore she would not have him if he turned up in the buff with a revolving bow tie. This, it turned out, was untrue. They ran away together, though, of course, not very fast or very far. Last night Frank's wife, Peggy, and Pat's husband, Roy, caught up with them. </p> <p>Peggy's Stone Age son, Phil, is a man of few words - and most of those offensive - but, when asked what happened, he showed an unsuspected gift for pellucid pr\u00e9cis. \"Roy shouted at Frank. Pat shouted at Roy. Frank shouted at Mum. Mum shouted back at Frank. There was a bit more shouting between Mum and Frank, and that was about it, really.\" That's about it any night in EastEnders. I could crochet round the edges a bit and say that Mum slapped Frank and Pat and Roy punched Frank on the nose and Frank, running out of thumpable options, knocked Guy Fawkes' head off. But basically, yes. that was about it. </p> <p>What Roy shouted at Pat will bear repetition. For a storm-tossed moment it looked as if their leaky marriage might make it to land. Roy was laying down the ground rules. \"This is year zero. No more lies. No more deceit and, if we're unhappy about something, we come right out and say it. Right, I'll start. I don't like your earrings. None of them. I never have.\" </p> <p>\"Pardon?\" said Pat. </p> <p>She had plenty to beg pardon for but this was the first time she'd said the word, and it didn't sound like an apology. Pat's earrings are a constant in an uncertain world, like Piccadilly Circus - with much the same candlepower. They swing like a pendulum. I have never seen her without them. She could inflict a nasty flesh wound by just by shaking her head. Fortunately, she is a girl who can't say no. </p> <p>This is probably the parting of the ways for Roy and Pat. It's one thing to ask a woman to give up the love of her life. It's another to criticise her dress sense. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in Coronation Street, Fred's long-running love for Audrey is in sight of the finishing post. He has fancied her since they attended a black pudding bonanza together (\"I brushed a bit of pork fillet off her blouse with me napkin. She said - you know how she talks - 'You're very sensitive for a butcher', and that were it. I were under her spell.\") On a trip to France he seized the bull by the horns, asked her again to marry him. She said yes, then, on sober reconsideration, er, no. \"I've been floating on air. Don't being me crashing down,\" begged Fred, who, now you mention it, bears a striking resemblance to the Hindenburg airship. Assuming the Hindenburg was standing up in a suit or Fred lying down naked. It may have been the latter consideration which changed Audrey's mind. </p> <p>Winter love - nothing to do with the season and everything to do with age - gets a mixed press. \"I think it's dead romantic,\" said Fred's son, a kindly if simple soul. \"I think it's dead weird,\" said his daughter-in-law. Either way, it's better than dead.</p>",

Thank you, once again, for your support.\" Websites devoted to women have also been hit by the bear market for internet companies. News.com, a technology site, cited Beautyjungle.com and Eve.com as two sites which had closed in the past month as funding dried up. Hopes for TheMan.com were high when it opened, however, because of the relatively limited competition from websites targeted at sophisticated male readers.",

      "body": "<p>It was a lovely idea, a 117p per share cash offer for airports operator <strong>TBI</strong> from a consortium of overseas investors fronted by the Irish financier behind London City Airport. </p> <p>But by the close of play yesterday the advice of one or two of the market's more mature brokers was: \"Sell TBI now.\" </p> <p>It was a predictable line. Since TBI received a bid approach from an unnamed suitor in August, its share price has been prone to periodic spikes. </p> <p>The last, in October, coincided with speculation that TBI, the world's largest owner of regional airports, had received a second and much more serious offer worth around \u00a3500m. </p> <p>The problem with the TBI tales are twofold. First, they seem to crop up when the share price starts to drift - in the past month it has slipped 10p and second, the valuations are always remarkably high. With a question mark still hanging over last year's acquisition of Airports International Group and a share price which has not been above 106p, is an offer of 117p really likely? </p> <p>Nevertheless, TBI shares closed up 4.75p at 79.5p in reasonably heavy volume but then it was the sort of day when supposedly well sourced stories were springing up all over the place. </p> <p>Ports operator <strong> Powell Duffyrn</strong> rose 10.5p to 605p on talk it will receive a 650p bid this morning. </p> <p> <strong> Carphone Warehouse </strong>, up 9.5p to 189.5p, was said to be in the process of setting up a lucrative airtime deal with one of the big mobile phone operators. The news, it is claimed, will be come alongside interim figures on Monday. </p> <p>But the most alarming tale of the day, and the one that induced panic in the wider market, involved the UK's biggest quoted company, <strong>Vodafone</strong>. </p> <p>Towards the close of trading the stock went into freefall - it finally settled 23.75p, or 8.58%, lower at 253p, after an amazing 446m shares changed hands - on word that the company had been busy guiding analysts' forecasts down. With Vodafone in its quiet period ahead of interim figures this month that would be in breach of market rules so there had to be another explanation, and sure enough one was found. </p> <p>Apparently UBS Warburg, Vodafone's house broker, has lowered its earnings forecasts for the year to March 2001. UBS would only say that it had made a downward adjustment to its earnings figures. Whatever the true nature of the downgrade, coming hard on the heels of the Worldcom profit warning it was enough to destroy the market's fragile confidence. \"If there are problems at Vodafone, then you can kiss goodbye to this market,\" was how one dealer put it. </p> <p>At the close the FTSE 100 was 65.6 points lower at 6,392, with a weak performance from oil heavyweights <strong> Shell</strong> and <strong> BP</strong> compounding the misery. Shell fell 20p to 542p after posting disappointing third quarter figures. It seems that an 80% rise in earnings is not enough for City analysts. </p> <p>A weakening oil price did not help matters either, and was behind in the fall in BP, down 15p to 582p. </p> <p>There were some bright spots among the leaders. <strong>British Airways</strong>, for the second time this week, stood out with a gain of 21.75p to 333.75p, helped by the weakening oil price and buying ahead of Monday's interim figures. </p> <p>The banking sector was also firm, with <strong> Bank of Scotland</strong> putting on 32p to 676p on news National Australia Bank is looking to beef up its operations in Britain. </p> <p>The FTSE 250 rose 29.6 points to 6,712.7 with set-top box maker <strong>Pace Micro</strong> adding 73.5p to 595.5p after CSFB raised its earnings forecasts. Talk of 200p per share bid drove <strong> Cantab Pharmaceuticals</strong> up 25p to 140p. </p> <p>Dealers were telling clients to keep an eye on building materials firm <strong> Heywood Williams.</strong> Although its shares fell 23p to 159.5p after a profit warning, they reckon a predator might now be tempted to strike.</p>",

Nevertheless, TBI shares closed up 4.75p at 79.5p in reasonably heavy volume but then it was the sort of day when supposedly well sourced stories were springing up all over the place. Ports operator Powell Duffyrn rose 10.5p to 605p on talk it will receive a 650p bid this morning. Carphone Warehouse , up 9.5p to 189.5p, was said to be in the process of setting up a lucrative airtime deal with one of the big mobile phone operators. The news, it is claimed, will be come alongside interim figures on Monday. But the most alarming tale of the day, and the one that induced panic in the wider market, involved the UK's biggest quoted company, Vodafone. Towards the close of trading the stock went into freefall - it finally settled 23.75p, or 8.58%, lower at 253p, after an amazing 446m shares changed hands - on word that the company had been busy guiding analysts' forecasts down. With Vodafone in its quiet period ahead of interim figures this month that would be in breach of market rules so there had to be another explanation, and sure enough one was found. Apparently UBS Warburg, Vodafone's house broker, has lowered its earnings forecasts for the year to March 2001. UBS would only say that it had made a downward adjustment to its earnings figures. Whatever the true nature of the downgrade, coming hard on the heels of the Worldcom profit warning it was enough to destroy the market's fragile confidence. \"If there are problems at Vodafone, then you can kiss goodbye to this market,\" was how one dealer put it. At the close the FTSE 100 was 65.6 points lower at 6,392, with a weak performance from oil heavyweights Shell and BP compounding the misery. Shell fell 20p to 542p after posting disappointing third quarter figures. It seems that an 80% rise in earnings is not enough for City analysts. A weakening oil price did not help matters either, and was behind in the fall in BP, down 15p to 582p. There were some bright spots among the leaders. British Airways, for the second time this week, stood out with a gain of 21.75p to 333.75p, helped by the weakening oil price and buying ahead of Monday's interim figures. The banking sector was also firm, with Bank of Scotland putting on 32p to 676p on news National Australia Bank is looking to beef up its operations in Britain. The FTSE 250 rose 29.6 points to 6,712.7 with set-top box maker Pace Micro adding 73.5p to 595.5p after CSFB raised its earnings forecasts. Talk of 200p per share bid drove Cantab Pharmaceuticals up 25p to 140p. Dealers were telling clients to keep an eye on building materials firm Heywood Williams. Although its shares fell 23p to 159.5p after a profit warning, they reckon a predator might now be tempted to strike.",

      "body": "<p>When I began a relationship with Rob three years ago he had just started attending Alcoholics Anonymous after many years of heavy drinking, which had resulted in the break-up of his marriage. When he and his wife separated, their two teenage sons remained with him. His relationship with the boys was often difficult but he always provided for them materially (hot meals, tidy house). However, he is the first to admit that he probably provided them with little emotional support. In the past three years he has remained sober and, through hard work, he has been rewarded with promotion and a large increase in salary. You would think that this prosperity and atmosphere of calm sobriety would unite the family, but it has only alienated the elder son. He has moved in with his mother, calling only to make financial demands. It's as if he feels that the only way Rob can make it up to him is to buy him things. Rob is willing to spend time with him but this isn't what his son wants. It's obvious that the boy has been damaged by Rob's drinking, but surely throwing money at him won't help. How have other readers coped?</p> <p><b> It's all about fear</b></p> <p>You should accept that your letter is likely not be an accurate account of what is happening between Rob and his son. I experienced very similar circumstances to those you describe when my mother and father divorced.</p> <p>Rob's son grew up in an environment where there were constants: mum, dad, brother and heavy drinking. Younger children do not understand the impacts of dependency on a marriage and family, so the drinking would have been a normal part of what would appear to him to be a stable family unit.</p> <p>When Rob's marriage failed and he stopped drinking, moved away from the home, started getting promotions, a better salary and, most importantly, a new relationship, the father that Rob's son had known all his life suddenly disappeared, replaced by a different person with different values and priorities.</p> <p>I tried to reacquaint myself with my \"new father\" over a period of 18 years, and many of my attempts to begin to familiarise myself with him took the form of asking for assistance in some way. I thought that because he had rejected drinking, my mother, our family home and his old lifestyle, changing himself into someone different, there was no reason why he would not reject me as well. The only way I could see to overcome this was to ask for help, because surely no father could refuse to assist one of his own children.</p> <p>These attempts failed, and as an adult I understand why. But in the process of my father trying to stop these requests for money, I felt alienated from my father as if he had rejected me along with the rest of his previous life.</p> <p>How you cope with the situation has no clear-cut formula. If Rob's son is old enough to sit down and talk with his father about what has happened and how they would like their relationship to progress, then all well and good.

It is likely that for a while the relationship will demand a lot of give and not much take on Rob's part until his son has seen that Rob's change of lifestyle makes no difference to his commitment to his sons.</p> <p>On the other hand, in my case, I realised that I had nothing in common with my father and that the changes in his life had made him a different person.

      "bodyText": "The government should introduce a system of graded fuel pricing determined by the distance of the fuel supply from urban centres or, rather, by population density (Blair takes fight to fuel protesters, November 2). Customers buying fuel in densely populated urban areas - where there is (or should be) a well-developed public transport system, where traffic congestion and pollution are problematic, and where resources are easily accessible - would then pay a high premium. Those in isolated rural areas - where public transport is limited and resources are further afield - would pay a reduced price. The government would be seen to be acting green while not penalising the countryside - and addressing some of the protesters' concerns. Charlie McCallum London So Tony Blair tells the protesters that fuel taxes must be maintained at their present levels because they are essential for funding the wholesome public services like health and education. In effect this means that health and education funding is dependent on continued road vehicle use. Could anyone enlighten me as to what implications such a taxation policy will have for global warming? Melvin Goldsmith Chelmsford, Essex Melvgold@aol.com Does Mr Prescott seriously believe we can do anything in the short term about the perceived climate crisis? The enhanced global warming phenomenon is something which stems from the middle ages. Blaming it on the increase in car use and suggesting that we must all do something about it now is misguided. We have never given much credence to the idea of global conservation, certainly not if it involves making an effort to do something that may result in southern England getting a little less rain in 300 years' time.

      "bodyText": "George W Bush's campaign admitted last night that the Republican presidential candidate had pleaded guilty to a drink-driving charge nearly a quarter of a century ago that has been kept secret until now. \"It's not something he's proud of,\" a campaign spokeswoman said last night, after copies of the police report on the arrest were faxed to news organisations in the state of Maine. In the 1976 incident, Mr Bush was arrested by police near the family summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, during the Labour Day weekend, which falls in early September. He was said to be driving with friends, whose identity has not been revealed. The incident took place the year before Mr Bush married his wife Laura. Police patrols pulled Mr Bush over after he was seen to be driving too slowly. Mr Bush pleaded guilty to driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and was fined $150. His right to drive in Maine was revoked for \"a period of time\", but Mr Bush's Texas driving licence was not affected. With just four days to go before the presidential election, the Bush campaign team moved into instant damage control mode late yesterday after the Fox News Channel broke the story on its early evening bulletin. Mr Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, called a special briefing at Chicago airport, speaking to travelling reporters at the foot of the steps beneath the Bush campaign plane as the Republican candidate prepared to fly to Milwaukee for a rally last night. \"I hope this mistake the governor made 24 years ago would not have an impact in the final days of this election,\" Ms Hughes said. \"The timing of this information coming out about something that happened 24 years ago and about which his daughters didn't even know before the election is questionable.\" Expectations have been rife that some sort of revelation about Mr Bush's past might see the light of day during the campaign, but the Republican nominee had managed to get to within four days of the presidential election before last night's news. Mr Bush has not made any secret of his struggle with the bottle before he finally gave up drinking a decade ago, before he began his meteoric political career. But the revelation of an arrest, plus the fact he had concealed it not just from the voting public but also from his daughters, is unlikely to win him any admirers and could conceivably cost him votes if the issue begins to fester in the final days of the close-fought campaign.",

      "body": "<p>Barbarous acts perpetrated on Iraqi political prisoners and women persist under Saddam Hussein's regime in spite of a decade of international economic sanctions engineered by the west to topple him, according to restricted Foreign Office documents obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>These state that in the last few weeks President Saddam and members of his inner circle have signed orders for executions and other acts of brutality.</p> <p>The material in the documents is said to have come directly from informants in Baghdad and, indirectly, from exiles. It will help Britain and the US in their efforts to shore up the sanctions - imposed on Iraq for igniting the Gulf war by invading Kuwait in 1990, but now under challenge.</p> <p>They will argue that the world must go on trying to force such a monstrous regime out. Opponents will argue that the abuses show how ineffective sanctions have been in weakening the dictatorship.</p> <p>The Foreign Office papers, classified as restricted, provide details of the extensive prison network in Baghdad and on individual cases that confirm the regime's reputation as one of the cruellest in the world.</p> <p>Among many incidents, the documents say that:</p> <p>\u0095More than 50 mental health patients were executed in place of prisoners with the means to bribe their way out.</p> <p>\u0095Eight prisoners were executed in October for defacing murals of Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>\u0095Thirty prostitutes were beheaded in a \"clean-up\" during the last month and their heads were left on the doorsteps of their homes.</p> <p>\u0095A man's tongue was cut off in September under a new decree making slander of President Saddam an amputation crime.</p> <p>While the international debate has gone on in recent years about the sanctions imposed on Iraq, and the bomb ing of its capital and missile sites by Britain and US, the regime's abuses have tended to be overlooked, partly because information is so hard to get.</p> <p>One of the Foreign Office papers says that the Iraqi government is obsessive about cataloguing its abuses. \"Each execution or torture order is signed by an immediate member of Saddam Hussein's family or his closest advisers.\" It adds: \"The orders allow the signatory to record how they want the victim to be tortured or to die.\" The tor ture and execution orders are said to be held on the eighth floor of the ministry of interior's main building in Baghdad. \"None of the normal lifts in the building stop at the eighth floor. This is only accessible by its own special lift.\"</p> <p>Among the signatories are President Saddam, his two sons, Uday and Qusay, and various relatives including the president's half-brothers. A former minister of the interior, Watban Ibrahim al-Hassan, is said to have \"had every execution videoed. Copies of the videos were kept in a vault in Hassan's office on the second floor of the ministry\".</p> <p>Among the many prisons dotted round Baghdad, the Mahjar (Sanctuary), near Palestine Street, holds about 600-700 political prisoners, according to the documents. To maintain the fear factor, and give an impression to the public of impartiality, the president has imprisoned relatives of his inner circle there to show that no one is immune.</p> <p>\"These high-level prisoners were held in the cells for detainees rather than in the prison itself and were only there for a number of days,\" one document says. Among those held was Ziyad Aziz, son of the deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz. The document de scribes the layout of the prison in detail. \"The execution area, the hadiqa (garden) is located near the women's [part of the] prison. The hadiqua is an open area with a sandbank covered by an awning\" where prisoners were killed by machine gun. Between 1993 and 1998 about 3,000 prisoners were executed there, it says.</p> <p>At another Baghdad prison, Abu Gharaib, death-row inmates are said to have been able to buy their freedom from the governor for $5,000: \"To meet the quota of people executed, and to avoid this scam being uncovered, someone would need to be executed.

      "bodyText": "Barbarous acts perpetrated on Iraqi political prisoners and women persist under Saddam Hussein's regime in spite of a decade of international economic sanctions engineered by the west to topple him, according to restricted Foreign Office documents obtained by the Guardian. These state that in the last few weeks President Saddam and members of his inner circle have signed orders for executions and other acts of brutality. The material in the documents is said to have come directly from informants in Baghdad and, indirectly, from exiles. It will help Britain and the US in their efforts to shore up the sanctions - imposed on Iraq for igniting the Gulf war by invading Kuwait in 1990, but now under challenge. They will argue that the world must go on trying to force such a monstrous regime out. Opponents will argue that the abuses show how ineffective sanctions have been in weakening the dictatorship. The Foreign Office papers, classified as restricted, provide details of the extensive prison network in Baghdad and on individual cases that confirm the regime's reputation as one of the cruellest in the world. Among many incidents, the documents say that: \u0095More than 50 mental health patients were executed in place of prisoners with the means to bribe their way out. \u0095Eight prisoners were executed in October for defacing murals of Saddam Hussein. \u0095Thirty prostitutes were beheaded in a \"clean-up\" during the last month and their heads were left on the doorsteps of their homes. \u0095A man's tongue was cut off in September under a new decree making slander of President Saddam an amputation crime. While the international debate has gone on in recent years about the sanctions imposed on Iraq, and the bomb ing of its capital and missile sites by Britain and US, the regime's abuses have tended to be overlooked, partly because information is so hard to get. One of the Foreign Office papers says that the Iraqi government is obsessive about cataloguing its abuses. \"Each execution or torture order is signed by an immediate member of Saddam Hussein's family or his closest advisers.\" It adds: \"The orders allow the signatory to record how they want the victim to be tortured or to die.\" The tor ture and execution orders are said to be held on the eighth floor of the ministry of interior's main building in Baghdad. \"None of the normal lifts in the building stop at the eighth floor. This is only accessible by its own special lift.\" Among the signatories are President Saddam, his two sons, Uday and Qusay, and various relatives including the president's half-brothers. A former minister of the interior, Watban Ibrahim al-Hassan, is said to have \"had every execution videoed. Copies of the videos were kept in a vault in Hassan's office on the second floor of the ministry\". Among the many prisons dotted round Baghdad, the Mahjar (Sanctuary), near Palestine Street, holds about 600-700 political prisoners, according to the documents. To maintain the fear factor, and give an impression to the public of impartiality, the president has imprisoned relatives of his inner circle there to show that no one is immune. \"These high-level prisoners were held in the cells for detainees rather than in the prison itself and were only there for a number of days,\" one document says. Among those held was Ziyad Aziz, son of the deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz. The document de scribes the layout of the prison in detail. \"The execution area, the hadiqa (garden) is located near the women's [part of the] prison. The hadiqua is an open area with a sandbank covered by an awning\" where prisoners were killed by machine gun. Between 1993 and 1998 about 3,000 prisoners were executed there, it says. At another Baghdad prison, Abu Gharaib, death-row inmates are said to have been able to buy their freedom from the governor for $5,000: \"To meet the quota of people executed, and to avoid this scam being uncovered, someone would need to be executed. The prison governor devised a scheme whereby he would take a patient from al-Sha ma'eel mental hospital to be executed in place of the released prisoner.\" About 50-60 people died in this way until both the governor and the director of the hospital were transferred in July, it is alleged. One of the groups carrying out the recent drive against prostitutes - the Fedayeen Saddam militia set up by Uday - is said to have \"beheaded about 30 prostitutes in Baghdad, Basra and other major cities. The ... heads were left on the front doorsteps of the prostitutes' homes as a deterrent.\" Another paper reveals that last month \"the Iraqi authorities executed eight prisoners on charges of forming an opposition organisation and defacing several murals depicting Saddam Hussein. \"Muhammed al-Naji, an engineer from Baghdad province, was the first to be charged with leading the organisation. His body, together with those of three of his companions, were handed on to their families on October 2.\" When in September the authorities began cutting off the tongue of anyone slandering the president or his family, an early victim is said to have been driven around his home suburb, New Baghdad, \"with a loudspeaker announcing the crime and the punishment\".",

      "bodyText": "The government is seeking to speed up the granting of licences for experiments on animals in the wake of scientists' warnings that red tape is holding back British science. In a move which will enrage animal rights lobbyists, who fear it will lead to more experiments, the Home Office is to assess the effectiveness of its ethical review process which was intended to safeguard animal welfare but increasingly has been seen by scientists as an extra bureaucratic layer. While the Home Office says it is motivated by a desire to improve animal welfare, sources privately admit it has been spurred into action by the anxiety of scientists. The review, which will consult scientists and animal welfare organisations, comes four months after 100 scientists, including five Nobel laureates and 38 Royal Society fellows, wrote to the science minister, Lord Sainsbury, warning that Britain was in danger of being left behind other nations because of its increasingly \"lengthy, complex, bureaucratic and inflexible\" system for regulating the use of animals. The average length of time taken to gain a licence for a specific project in Britain is eight months, compared to four weeks in the US. Last night Colin Blakemore, professor of neuroscience at Oxford University, said such relative intransigence was proving \"catastrophic\" for British scientists. \"The worry is, it's simply driving high quality research, and people, abroad,\" he said. Prof Blakemore said the problem was that the Home Office had failed to stipulate just how thorough the \"ethical review process\" - conducted by individual research institutions - should be. While drug companies addressed the issue swiftly, universities often became embroiled in a five-month assessment of not only this but the merits of the research. Last night scientists welcomed the review, which was suggested when the process was launched in April 1999. They denied it would lead to an increase in experiments on animals or to a decline in their welfare. \"It's not about making it easier to carry out experiments on animals,\" added Nancy Rothwell, professor of neuroscience at Manchester University. \"It's about making it quicker and more efficient.\" But animal rights lobbyists were unconvinced. \"We are very concerned about any move to allow scientists to get access to animals and to allow more of this,\" said Wendy Higgins, campaigns director of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection.",

Police said last night that the woman blown apart in the blast, Ayelet Hashahar Levy, was moving into her home, and confirmed that she was the daughter of the leader of Israel's National Religious Party. \"I started running as soon as I heard the blast,\" said Yakov Hasson, who owns a shop nearby. \"I tried to pull the woman out, but then I saw to my sorrow that she was in pieces. Her legs were gone, and she was dead.\" His trousers were spattered with her blood. Yesterday's explosion came one hour after the time originally set for Mr Barak and Mr Arafat to announce a ceasefire. But with the announcement delayed for \"technical reasons\", this agreement - the fifth ceasefire in as many weeks - seems still-born. Officials from Mr Barak's office said the Israeli army would still honour its promise to roll back the tanks from Palestinian cities in the West Bank and Gaza. For Mr Arafat, Palestinian officials reaffirmed their commitment to return to talks should Israeli troops stop shooting their young people and lift their siege of Palestinian cities. But their peoples are no longer thinking of peace. Minutes after the blast at Mahane Yehuda, angry crowds gathered near the police cordons chanting: \"death to Arabs\" and \"Arabs get out of our land\", and one Arab man was severely beaten. A few miles south of Jerusalem, in the Palestinian village of al-Khadir which was rocketed by Israeli helicopter gunships and tanks on Wednesday, there was also little faith that peace could take root here. \"I don't believe in these agreements. I never do. The facts we live with have nothing to do with the lives of our leaders. We are living through the middle of a war, and they are meeting and laughing, having their pictures taken and eating nice food,\" said Malak Othman, sifting through the charred remains of her house, which took two direct hits. \"They don't feel what I am feeling, neither Barak or Arafat.\" Within hours of the blast, a Palestinian man was shot through the heart in the same town, and there were reports of gun battles from the nearby towns of Bethlehem and Gilo, a Jewish settlement on the southern fringes of Jerusalem. A second Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli troops in Hizme, north of Jerusalem.

      "bodyText": "Radioactive contamination of rivers around a top-secret Russian nuclear weapons complex in Siberia has reached \"staggering\" levels, the worst ever monitored, and is out of \"rational control\", a joint team of Russian and American radiation monitors said yesterday. Following a monitoring expedition in July and August to the closed plutonium complex at Seversk, near Tomsk in western Siberia, the Russian and American nuclear watchdogs said they had registered alarming levels of radioactivity in tributaries of the River Ob, a key Siberian waterway. \"We've never encountered such radiation. It's the worst contamination we've found,\" said Sergei Pashchenko, a Novosibirsk professor and atmospheric pollution expert who headed the Russian side of the survey carried out by Siberian Scientists for Global Responsibility and Government Accountability Project. The director of the American watchdog, Tom Carpenter, said: \"We were shocked at the levels of contamination.\" The environmentalists said they found levels of caesium and strontium-90 vastly exceeding safety levels in the rivers Tom and Romashka close to the \"Siberian Chemical Complex\", a sprawling facility established by the former Soviet Union in the 1950s to make weapons-grade plutonium for warheads. But even more disturbingly, said Mr Pashchenko, plant life in the rivers contained high levels of phosphorus-32 which decays within a couple of weeks, meaning that the radioactive effluent was of very recent origin whereas the strontium and the caesium could date back to the 1960s. \"The phosphorus-32 is a very short-lived isotope and this means they are very fresh,\" said Mr Pashchenko. The closed nuclear town of Seversk is effectively a suburb of Tomsk, a city with a population of half-a-million in western Siberia. Seversk was born in 1949, at the very onset of the superpowers' nuclear arms race. It ranked among the top three sites for the manufacturing of weapons-grade plutonium and uranium enrichment for the Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal throughout the cold war. The plutonium was manufactured from five nuclear reactors commissioned between 1955 and 1967. \"They are very old reactors and very unsafe,\" said Igor Forofontov, radiation specialist with Greenpeace in Moscow. The three oldest reactors were closed between 1990 and 1992, and, under a 1992 agreement between Moscow and Washington aimed at halting plutonium production, all five reactors should have been closed down by this year. But two reactors are still operating, providing heating and electricity to Tomsk. \"The authorities have no intention of closing them,\" Mr Forofontov said. An explosion ripped through the plant in 1993 which resulted in large amounts of radioactivity being emitted. Mr Forofontov also said lethal amounts of radioactivity were leaking into the soil and the water in the region because of the practice of storing waste from the reactors in liquid form which is then pumped deep below ground. Last summer, the Russian monitors spent two months touring the most sensitive nuclear materials production installations - one of the most dangerous legacies of the Soviet era - at Chelyabinsk, Krasnoyarsk, Novosibirsk, and Tomsk. But the environmentalists' findings in Tomsk were the most alarming. \"The nuclear waste is being piped straight into the environment,\" said Norm Buske, one of the American researchers and an oceanographer and physicist. \"This has not been done anywhere in the world since the cold war.\" The monitors were unable to pinpoint the source of the pollution because they were not granted access to the secret plant.

      "body": "<p>After a month of bloody chaos there were two competing claims of responsibility yesterday for the market bombing in Jerusalem, raising fresh fears of a new wave of bombing.</p> <p>One of them is the Revolutionary Guards of the al-Aqsa Saints, which takes its name from the Muslim holy place at the core of this conflict. It was unheard of until Monday when in a statement from Beirut it claimed responsibility for shooting two Israeli security guards at a social security office in Arab East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since 1967.</p> <p>However, there was a rival claim yesterday from Damascus, where the Jerusalem Squadrons, claiming to be the armed wing of the Islamic Jihad, said they carried out the market bombing in retaliation for crimes against the Palestinian people.</p> <p>The competing claims are bound to discomfit Israeli officials who assumed within minutes of the explosion that it was the work of local Palestinians, Islamic Jihad or Hamas militants freed in recent weeks from jails in the West Bank and Gaza.</p> <p>Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, said in a statement yesterday that he also held Mr Arafat indirectly responsible, because he has freed dozens of militants.</p> <p>\"The prime minister demands the Palestinian Authority return to jail all the prisoners it released over the last weeks and to fight terror again,\" a statement from Mr Barak's office said.</p> <p>It said yesterday's attack \"stems from a loosening of the reins by the Palestinian Authority and the release of Hamas and Islamic Jihad prisoners\".</p> <p>Israel has repeatedly accused Mr Arafat of giving a \"green light\" to terror by releasing dozens of Islamist militants on October 12, the day its helicopter gunships attacked police installations in the West Bank and Gaza.</p> <p>Palestinian officials argue that most of the prisoners were moved to other jails, or placed under house arrest for their protection. They and Hamas leaders add that many of the prisoners were later re-arrested.</p> <p>Yesterday, Hamas leaders offered only cryptic comments on the attack. In Gaza, the wheelchair-bound Hamas leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, said: \"This is a retaliation for Israeli behaviour. When they bombard women, old people and children in their houses, they should expect that people want to defend themselves.\"</p> <p>There was no immediate response from the local wing of the Islamic Jihad which claimed last week's suicide bombing in Gaza, in which a lone cyclist, wearing a backpack with at least five kilos of explosives, pedalled up to an Israeli army post and blew himself up, slightly injuring one soldier.</p> <p>In the last two weeks, leaders of Mr Arafat's Fatah organisation said they were trying to limit casualties in the pitched battles between stone-throwing teenagers and Israeli machine-gunners by saving their energies for attacks on settlements or army command posts.</p> <p>That is not the case for Hamas, however, which preaches that any Israeli, civilian or soldier, in the West Bank or Gaza or inside the borders of the Jewish state, is fair game.</p> <p>\"From our point of view this is a popular military intifada. Anyone who carries a gun, and shoots at an Israeli target can do it on his own, and at a suitable time for him,\" said Ismail Abu Shanab, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza.</p> <p>Yesterday's attack was the second in Jewish West Jerusalem after a pipe bomb exploded near the city's main theatre, injuring one man. No group has claimed that attack.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\" target=\"_new\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\" target=\"_new\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.moledet.org.il/moleng.htm\" target=\"_new\">Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party) <br></a><a href=\"http://www.iris.org.il/\" target=\"_new\">Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3188/\" target=\"_new\">Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.virtual.co.il/orgs/orgs/ichud/irindex.htm\" target=\"_new\">Organisation of Rabbis for the People of Israel</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\" target=\"_new\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\" target=\"_new\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Hamas</a></p>",

One of them is the Revolutionary Guards of the al-Aqsa Saints, which takes its name from the Muslim holy place at the core of this conflict. It was unheard of until Monday when in a statement from Beirut it claimed responsibility for shooting two Israeli security guards at a social security office in Arab East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel since 1967. However, there was a rival claim yesterday from Damascus, where the Jerusalem Squadrons, claiming to be the armed wing of the Islamic Jihad, said they carried out the market bombing in retaliation for crimes against the Palestinian people. The competing claims are bound to discomfit Israeli officials who assumed within minutes of the explosion that it was the work of local Palestinians, Islamic Jihad or Hamas militants freed in recent weeks from jails in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, said in a statement yesterday that he also held Mr Arafat indirectly responsible, because he has freed dozens of militants. \"The prime minister demands the Palestinian Authority return to jail all the prisoners it released over the last weeks and to fight terror again,\" a statement from Mr Barak's office said. It said yesterday's attack \"stems from a loosening of the reins by the Palestinian Authority and the release of Hamas and Islamic Jihad prisoners\". Israel has repeatedly accused Mr Arafat of giving a \"green light\" to terror by releasing dozens of Islamist militants on October 12, the day its helicopter gunships attacked police installations in the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinian officials argue that most of the prisoners were moved to other jails, or placed under house arrest for their protection. They and Hamas leaders add that many of the prisoners were later re-arrested. Yesterday, Hamas leaders offered only cryptic comments on the attack. In Gaza, the wheelchair-bound Hamas leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, said: \"This is a retaliation for Israeli behaviour. When they bombard women, old people and children in their houses, they should expect that people want to defend themselves.\" There was no immediate response from the local wing of the Islamic Jihad which claimed last week's suicide bombing in Gaza, in which a lone cyclist, wearing a backpack with at least five kilos of explosives, pedalled up to an Israeli army post and blew himself up, slightly injuring one soldier. In the last two weeks, leaders of Mr Arafat's Fatah organisation said they were trying to limit casualties in the pitched battles between stone-throwing teenagers and Israeli machine-gunners by saving their energies for attacks on settlements or army command posts. That is not the case for Hamas, however, which preaches that any Israeli, civilian or soldier, in the West Bank or Gaza or inside the borders of the Jewish state, is fair game. \"From our point of view this is a popular military intifada. Anyone who carries a gun, and shoots at an Israeli target can do it on his own, and at a suitable time for him,\" said Ismail Abu Shanab, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza. Yesterday's attack was the second in Jewish West Jerusalem after a pipe bomb exploded near the city's main theatre, injuring one man. No group has claimed that attack.

He kicked the issue of monetary union into the long grass shortly after arriving at the CBI last year, and there it will stay until the government clarifies its position. No, what worries the CBI is that Labour's idea of government \"by the people and for the people\" in the run up to the election will mean the unions calling the shots. </p> <p>\"In the UK we have labour market flexibility which is the envy of the world, but business has been swamped by 16 pieces of employment legislation in two years.

He wants regulations which are \"a waste of time and money\" scrapped, and for officialdom to show rather less zeal in policing directives from Brussels - one area where he says the UK acts like exemplary Europeans. But Europe is not Jones's real concern. He kicked the issue of monetary union into the long grass shortly after arriving at the CBI last year, and there it will stay until the government clarifies its position. No, what worries the CBI is that Labour's idea of government \"by the people and for the people\" in the run up to the election will mean the unions calling the shots. \"In the UK we have labour market flexibility which is the envy of the world, but business has been swamped by 16 pieces of employment legislation in two years. This is legislation attuned to helping those already in work rather than those who are out of it. We are saying to the government: no more legislation.\"",

Well, now they do. Ridley Scott's modern-day epic has the sweep and confidence of the old days and, in Russell Crowe, an effortlessly convincing action man fit to fill the sandals of Charlton Heston and Kirk Douglas. </p> <p>It's deeply old-fashioned too in giving us a hero as utterly unflawed as Crowe's Maximus and a villain without a hint of a redeeming feature in Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus. A little more human nature would have made it more interesting, but most of the time Ridley Scott sweeps you away with confidently mounted action scenes, a great sense of scale - this may be a CGI ancient Rome but it looks solid - and some interesting minor characters.

Well, now they do. Ridley Scott's modern-day epic has the sweep and confidence of the old days and, in Russell Crowe, an effortlessly convincing action man fit to fill the sandals of Charlton Heston and Kirk Douglas. It's deeply old-fashioned too in giving us a hero as utterly unflawed as Crowe's Maximus and a villain without a hint of a redeeming feature in Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus. A little more human nature would have made it more interesting, but most of the time Ridley Scott sweeps you away with confidently mounted action scenes, a great sense of scale - this may be a CGI ancient Rome but it looks solid - and some interesting minor characters. None of these is better than Oliver Reed as a wily ex-gladiator, though it's also nice to see Derek Jacobi back in a toga for those whose Roman history begins with I, Claudius and David Hemmings as a sort of fight MC. His role reminds you that while the original epics were made to lure lapsed cinemagoers back to the big screen it's probably the success of TV's Gladiators and WWF wrestlers that made DreamWorks think the time could be right for a return to the Colosseum.

      "body": "<p>Ismail Merchant and James Ivory's attempt at The Golden Bowl - the K2 of period adaptation - coincides with a fortuitous little burst of Henry James jokes in the movies. In Woody Allen's Small Time Crooks, our bespectacled hero's attention is directed to The Master's elegant townhouse in New York, and he muddles him up with Harry James, the band leader. And in David Mamet's State and Main, William H Macy, in a tiny, delirious moment, toys with the idea that Henry James is the third brother in a trio of Old West robbers, along with Frank and Jesse. And it is diverting to think of the massive dome of Henry James's head crowned with a stetson with six-guns at his hips, or grinning on a bandstand with a trumpet. </p> <p>There are laughs to be had in putting James at odds with his own Americanness, and indeed his own prototypical modernity. But that is arguably nothing other than an extrapolation of his own life and work - and nowhere is this theme sounded more emphatically, or with more solemnity and grandeur, than in The Golden Bowl, in which American innocence once again finds itself gazing into the abyss of European experience. </p> <p>Is it possible to find a cinematic equivalent for James's extraordinary sentences? For the looping, meandering phrases and thickets of syntax in which vital meanings and narrative points are concealed? If it is not, then the Merchant Ivory team, and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, who wrote the screenplay, have at least the satisfaction of knowing that they have made a very honourable and intelligent stab at filming one of the greatest, as well as one of the most difficult books of the 20th century. The result is a sophisticated drama for grown-ups, handsomely designed, sumptuously furnished, and featuring a really stunning performance from Uma Thurman, for whom The Golden Bowl might well turn out to be her finest hour. </p> <p>Jeremy Northam plays Prince Amerigo, an Italian nobleman with a baroque and gamey lineage of plotters, intriguers and cardinals. To rescue his flagging fortunes, he makes a brilliant engagement in 1903 to Maggie Verver (Kate Beckinsale), the lovely, innocent young daughter of America's first billionaire, widower Adam Verver (Nick Nolte), a man concerned with amassing a gigantic collection of European art for a huge museum he is building back home. But Amerigo has a secret: a former mistress - although their relationship is never described so tactlessly - in the form of beautiful Charlotte Stant (Thurman), a childhood friend of Maggie's. Charlotte is passionately unwilling to surrender her relationship with the prince, and so with the prince's covert encouragement, pursues Adam and marries him. </p> <p>And so the ambiguous foursome is able to continue its strange, unwholesome proximity: the prince with Charlotte, and Adam with his daughter, to whom he is fiercely attached. Each pair is aware of its own infidelity: Amerigo's with Charlotte, and Maggie's, in a sense, with Adam, a deeply loved paterfamilias whose primacy in her life she is reluctant to dissolve or supplant. It is a subtle, delicate web of deception and self-deception, in which the participants know and do not know what is going on under their noses. </p> <p>The symbol for this enigma is the golden bowl itself, which Charlotte picks out as a wedding present for Maggie, and which, due to some slightly strained plot twists, finally reveals the adultery. The bowl has a secret flaw: a crack somewhere in the gilt. It is invisible, and yet the knowledge that the flaw is there spoils it as a present, and makes it an ill augury and presentiment of shame hidden within outward perfection. </p> <p>It is a very Jamesian motif, faithfully preserved in spirit by James Ivory here: a baffling and even exasperating puzzle. In the film, as in the book, none of the principals ask to see where the bowl's flaw actually is, and we are never shown it in close-up, despite the air of fastidious aesthetic connoisseurship that saturates the movie. In the elusive spider's web of hinted-at emotion that James spins, the bowl does a good deal of metaphorical work in symbolising all the mysteries of the human heart. In the movie, with its explicit kisses and embraces, the bowl is less important. This is a pity. </p> <p>But Uma Thurman gives a dazzling performance as Charlotte, glorying at first in her victory at appearing to have secured wealth, status and renewed access to her lover - and then increasingly distraught as these things crumble. Jeremy Northam is elegant and sinuous, but Kate Beckinsale and Nick Nolte give rather reticent, even pallid performances in comparison. That, however, is a consequence of this movie making emotional transgression so explicit, and so the wicked European and his paramour will inevitably seem more vivid. </p> <p>This is a film that demands a good deal from a modern audience. They must understand its profound and mysterious sense of sin; they must understand its moral sense of marriage yet share its appreciation that adultery, if managed with sufficient discretion and taste, is not the end of the world and, indeed, that marriage and adultery can peacefully co-exist for long periods. If Nietzsche went beyond good and evil, then Henry James can be said to have gone beyond fidelity and adultery in The Golden Bowl. </p> <p>In the end, James Ivory does not inhabit the book as fully as Terence Davies managed with Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth and his \"five years later\" captions are a little jarring. But this is still a very enjoyable and perceptive film. The big Merchant Ivory costume extravaganza may be very unfashionable at the moment, but as the merit of this excellent movie dawns on everyone, I predict that the pendulum will swing back.</p>",

If not a captain's innings, it was certainly that of a stand-in. </p> <p>An innings from Hick could be transposed from one match to the next with no one much the wiser. As ever when he scores well, he was massively efficient, carving the ball away on the off-side, driving solidly, hooking occasionally, playing the off-spinner Munir Ansari, a jerky Muralitharan lookalike, with quizzical humour and twice lofting the brisk Kumble-style leg-spin of Mohammad Shafiq ramrod-straight for effortless sixes to go with 10 further boundaries in his unbeaten 77. The 111th century of his career is on the cards this morning. </p> <p>The pair were together for 42 overs after a lively opening burst from the Test bowler Mohammad Akram and the teenager Mohammad Sami had removed Marcus Trescothick, Michael Vaughan and Mike Atherton for 52. Atherton went in lackadaisical fashion, playing pat-a-cake with point. </p> <p>At 212 for four when the sun disappeared rosily into the Rawalpindi smog with two overs remaining, England are 25 runs adrift. </p> <p>Earlier the England bowlers had utilised the damp morning conditions and a new ball to take the remaining five wickets for 49. As far north as this, where it is cool at night and the sun's heat fails to have any impact until mid-morning, heavy dew makes the wicket clammy and first Matthew Hoggard, then Dominic Cork took advantage. Hoggard, in fact, struck with the opening delivery of the day, having the left-handed Qaisar Abbas leg-before, and followed that in his next over by pegging back Javed Qadeer's off- stump to give him his fifth wicket. </p> <p>To this point Hoggard had bowled impeccably, maintaining a wonderfully consistent line on off-stump with seven fielders on the off-side. It is always difficult not to seek the comfort zone too far outside off-stump. </p> <p>Then, however, the Yorkshireman lost his discipline, indulging in some machismo short bowling against Shafiq, who took it on and carved the main part of an eighth-wicket stand of 36 before Cork had him caught at long-leg. He should have been prised out for fewer than 32 by orthodox means. Hoggard's five for 62, nevertheless, remains a worthy effort.</p>",

Spotlit and sequinned, it drips with a glamour straight out of the American dream. </p> <p>Inspired by the slick of Las Vegas and the Liberace sound and shine, it ends the evening on a high, high heel. This is a very fast, tricky composition. Hips swivel, feet strut, piano keys ripple like perfect pecs, all at once. It is balletic and then showgirl. It is swinging loose and then uptight. It is stagey and then for real. What is going on is anybody's guess.

Spotlit and sequinned, it drips with a glamour straight out of the American dream. Inspired by the slick of Las Vegas and the Liberace sound and shine, it ends the evening on a high, high heel. This is a very fast, tricky composition. Hips swivel, feet strut, piano keys ripple like perfect pecs, all at once. It is balletic and then showgirl. It is swinging loose and then uptight. It is stagey and then for real. What is going on is anybody's guess. Glamour is at the heart of it, but both music (Le Tombeau de Liberace by Michael Daugherty, played lusciously live by London Musici) and dance melt so quickly from frame to frame that you're taken from 50s film to snake-charming chant in the time it takes to say \"Sunset Strip\".

      "body": "<p>The Marquis de Sade seems to be in mode this season, what with the recent re-release of Pasolini's Salo, and now two festival screenings of films about French literature's leading reprobate. Benoit Jacquot's Sade has Daniel Auteuil as a Byronic and rather benign philosopher, casting a chilly eye on the excesses of the revolutionary terror going on around him. Where Jacquot's sober study primarily addresses history and ideas, Philip Kaufman's very different Quills is a flamboyant pantomime farce that portrays Sade as both pornographer and political dissident, and writer above all. </p> <p>Where Jacquot's film has the Marquis as the inmate of an aristocratic clinic - a pampered refuge for protected nobs - Quills, adapted by Doug Wright from his own play, is set in Charenton asylum. Sade (Geoffrey Rush) busily pumps out scandalous texts from his cell, smuggled out by laundress Madeleine (Kate Winslet). His activity is tolerated by the hospital's idealistic young director, the Abb\u00e9 Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix), but a corrupt new enforcer (Michael Caine) is soon brought in to shut off his flow of lascivious outpourings. </p> <p>The film's robust, sometimes near-hysterical gusto places it somewhere between Fellini, Hogarth and a Carry On film. In fact, you can just imagine Jim Dale as the blushing Coulmier, and Geoffrey Rush looks gnarled enough to be mistaken for Sid James.

      "bodyText": "The Marquis de Sade seems to be in mode this season, what with the recent re-release of Pasolini's Salo, and now two festival screenings of films about French literature's leading reprobate. Benoit Jacquot's Sade has Daniel Auteuil as a Byronic and rather benign philosopher, casting a chilly eye on the excesses of the revolutionary terror going on around him. Where Jacquot's sober study primarily addresses history and ideas, Philip Kaufman's very different Quills is a flamboyant pantomime farce that portrays Sade as both pornographer and political dissident, and writer above all. Where Jacquot's film has the Marquis as the inmate of an aristocratic clinic - a pampered refuge for protected nobs - Quills, adapted by Doug Wright from his own play, is set in Charenton asylum. Sade (Geoffrey Rush) busily pumps out scandalous texts from his cell, smuggled out by laundress Madeleine (Kate Winslet). His activity is tolerated by the hospital's idealistic young director, the Abb\u00e9 Coulmier (Joaquin Phoenix), but a corrupt new enforcer (Michael Caine) is soon brought in to shut off his flow of lascivious outpourings. The film's robust, sometimes near-hysterical gusto places it somewhere between Fellini, Hogarth and a Carry On film. In fact, you can just imagine Jim Dale as the blushing Coulmier, and Geoffrey Rush looks gnarled enough to be mistaken for Sid James. But the boisterous, salty larking - at its height when Sade writes a scabrous stage satire - has a serious point. This is very much a debate on censorship, presenting Sade as a sexual and ideological refusenik deprived of his right to expression. But neither he nor his work is idealised, and the grand guignol climax awkwardly poses the question of the author's responsibility for his writing's effect. The least you can say about Quills is that it tackles contentious material with which Hollywood wouldn't dirty its hands.

There were hilarious stories of being dumped by his girlfriend, as well as a merciless and very funny trashing of boybands, girlbands, indeed any bands who aren't heavy metal (hence his long hair). </p> <p>A shrewd look at homophobia received laughs of recognition, and Byrne mocked his own puniness to good effect in sending up martial arts, sex appeal (or lack of it), and his passionate aversion to scales: \"I maybe Irish, but I'm not a jockey.\" Despite the lack of alcohol, the audience was soon won over by Byrne's big-laugh blend of Irish coyness and eye-bulging, honest-bloke wit.
