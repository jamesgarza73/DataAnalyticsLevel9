It's where Donald Trump sloped off with Marla Maples, where Goldie Hawn, Michael Douglas, Kevin Kostner, Don Johnson, Sally Field, the Murdochs and the Eisners, the Lauders and the 'big swinging dicks' of Wall Street have their other homes. Aspen is snow and glitz, furs and jewels, swanky restaurants, hideaway spreads for the rich and famous. Aspen is all of that but it is also - and this may surprise you - an eco-friendly resort. </p> <p>The charm of Aspen is that it is all the clich\u00e9s you ever imagined - and then something more besides. Hidden away, deep in the Rockies, it was once a little silvermining town, a western outpost, and round the sweet Victorian houses and wide streets there still clings something of the old pioneer spirit. Ever since the bottom dropped out of the silver market and skiing eventually took its place, it has always made room for the ski-bums and left-over hippies, the schoolteachers and the dreamers of this world. </p> <p>Turn up in Aspen as a stranger and you soon run into high-minded little local projects and forceful groups who are determined that the voices of the people who live there year-round will be heard. This is more than a town grown rich on the fur-clad set, they'll have you know - it's a community with a vibrant life of its own and it isn't going to have its interests and its life-blood drained by the extravagant desires of the fly-in-fly-out high-spenders. </p> <p>Anybody who doubts this should try reading the letters pages of the local newspapers, filled with passionate exchanges on everything from beavers and elks to the evils of the construction industry. This is where the Aspen Skiing Company comes in. This privately owned business which runs the slopes and ski-lifts of the four mountains that make up the resort recently won the long-haul section of the British Airways Tourism for Tomorrow Awards for sustainable developments. Its chief executive, Pat O'Donnell, came from that most eco-conscious of companies, the Patagonia Clothing Company. He loves mountains and skiing but says the important thing is to get the balance between 'economic viability and environmental responsibility' right. </p> <p>But it takes two to tango and none of O'Donnell's ideals would matter a row of pins if he did not work for a company that was prepared to put some money behind the ethos. This means, says O'Donnell: 'We don't have to worry about short-term profits and can look instead to the long term.' </p> <p>Hence the company has decided that it will not build any new ski areas - a strategy that most other ski resorts would think amounted to economic suicide. 'We think enough is enough. We're upgrading what we've already got, we're linking some ski areas together but we're not going to open up any new ones.' </p> <p>O'Donnell has brought a handful of hard-core environmentalists from the Roaring Fork Valley (a militant group, judging by their vociferous letters) on to various committees of the Aspen Skiing Company. 'They're all experts on water and trees and creeks and they make sure we toe the environmental line while we try to get them to understand that we also have to make money and bring in the tourists which help provide jobs and incomes.' </p> <p>The environmental strategy revolves around recycling and making the best use of existing resources. In the old days when they pulled down a hotel they would take the rubble to the landfill pit; these days it is recycled and the demolition department is now a profit centre. And to ensure that apartments don't lie empty for most of the year they have come up with the idea of a private ownership club which gives regular visitors a permanent stake in a property. </p> <p>However, the company's most novel contribution to its environmental ideals, and the one that caught the attention of the Tourism for Tomorrow judges, is its wind-powered lift, the Cirque. High up on Snowmass, one of the world's great skiing mountains, it is the only wind-powered ski lift in the state and over a full year it would keep 192,000lb of carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, out of the atmosphere and some 80,000lbs of coal in the ground. So as not to disturb local wildlife it was built between animal mating and nesting periods and to protect the delicate tundra it was built by hand, with every single piece of equipment being carried up the 12,510ft mountain on foot and every piece of rubble being carried down. The result is that skiers can now ski over a pristine area which used to be closed to them - but when the wind is wrong or the elk are mating, then the lift is closed. Animals and the habitat come first. </p> <p>Though we all like to think it matters to us, few skiers choose a resort simply because of its eco-friendly policies: there have to be other reasons why people return year after year, in spite of the jetlag and the high prices. There are. We go because the air is crisper, the snow is drier and lighter than powder, the pistes are never crowded, American skiers mind their manners, on top of the mountain there is free hot apple juice, coffee and muffins, and Aspen is always thinking of new ways to please the skier. There is a constant stream of free buses round the town and between the mountains which are funded by the Aspen Ski Company because they not only cut down on pollution but are a huge help to the visitor. There are free tissues at every lift station.

There are (very expensive) day excursions on snow-cats which will find you the fresh snow. And we go, above all, because there are four amazing mountains to explore. Because of poor early snow-falls Aspen has had a run of not very special seasons and so it tries harder. </p> <p>But after all that is added up it still is nice to know that you are skiing in a place where people mind about things that matter.

      "body": "<p>Being whipped on the bottom by a 65-year-old man would normally be considered far too kinky and embarrassing to talk about in public. But when this little ritual occurs at the top of an alp it is regarded as perfectly normal. </p> <p>The peak in question is Mount Triglav, the highest point in Slovenia and its mountain range, the Julian Alps. The guidebook had mentioned that those reaching the summit for the first time were likely to be birched, but it sounded like a myth. </p> <p>Not so. On a sunny September morning, I found myself clambering up Triglav on a hiking holiday in this lush and lovely country, which escaped the Balkan conflict that engulfed neighbouring Croatia and Bosnia in the Nineties. I was one of a motley threesome that had teamed up spontaneously to bag the mountain: the others were Ralph, an unemployed German economist in his thirties, and 65-year-old Milan, a Slovenian psychologist from the capital Ljubljana. </p> <p>We arrived at the top just in time to see an Austrian being whacked on the backside with a climbing rope, watched by clusters of jovial Slovenes applauding and singing a folk song in approval. Before we could even take a picture of the fabulous view or nibble a celebratory muesli bar, Milan had borrowed the rope and put first me and then Ralph over his knee for a ritual Triglav thrashing. </p> <p>Can you imagine such behaviour in Snowdonia or the Lake District? Outrageous. </p> <p>In Slovenia it was just another casual laugh to contribute to the genial, party atmosphere that prevails on top of Triglav most mornings in good weather as dozens of Slovenes, and usually a handful of tourists, follow the well-worn route to the top. </p> <p>Climbing Triglav is something of a Slovenian tradition and akin to a patriotic rite of passage for the young - the downside is the presence of small memorials dotting the route, marking the point at which teenagers climbing alone or in groups have been swept off by avalanche or stumbled to their deaths. </p> <p>The Slovenes dubbed the mountain 'Old Mr Three Heads' centuries ago when its lumpy summit was thought to represent a triple-headed deity that ruled the sky, the earth and the underworld. Its 2,863-metre peak was first scaled in 1778 and features prominently on the national flag. </p> <p>Milan was ascending for the 49th time, having first made the summit at 13. Ralph and I had met the night before in the spartan mountain hostel three-quarters of the way up the mountain over goulash with macaroni and sausages - perfect examples of the culinary influences of Slovenia's neighbours, Hungary, Italy and Austria. </p> <p>Most people trying for Triglav stay at the hostel after a day's steep trek up from lush pasture, through pine woods, past scree and sheer limestone to the little hut offering food and a bunk. </p> <p>We set off for the top at 6.30 the following morning, heading into clear blue sky with the rising sun. Milan, a veteran of Mont Blanc, Kilimanjaro and 49 previous assaults on Triglav went first. We hauled ourselves up by a series of metal spikes and cables, embedded in the rock by the army on military exercises years ago. Milan stopped for us to rest and survey the spectacular surrounding peaks, blue in the early morning with traces of snow. The sunlight reflected off the beautiful Lake Bled in the valley miles below, resembling a shining, silver penny. </p> <p>'Amazing,' I said. </p> <p>'Amazing Grace!' he said eccentrically and started whistling it. He held his arms out as if to embrace his homeland. 'I feel like the Queen! Call me Elizabeth!' he shouted from under his purple bobble hat. </p> <p>A gasping Ralph brought up the rear. He had already moaned about his beer gut holding him back and a lack of sleep on account of all the blokes in his dormitory snoring. He looked rough. 'I'm hanging in there... like a boxer,' he panted, leaning heavily on the cables. 'I think this is the first time I climb Triglav - and the last.' </p> <p>Milan tutted as we precariously picked our way up the steep rock past the memorials. 'These shouldn't be up here, they should be down in the valley,' he said. The mountain is a pimple compared with the likes of Mont Blanc, which is almost 2,000 metres higher. But people still die on Triglav each year. </p> <p>The Julian Alps were named for Julius Caesar, after the Romans annexed Slovenia from Trieste in the second century.

      "bodyText": "Being whipped on the bottom by a 65-year-old man would normally be considered far too kinky and embarrassing to talk about in public. But when this little ritual occurs at the top of an alp it is regarded as perfectly normal. The peak in question is Mount Triglav, the highest point in Slovenia and its mountain range, the Julian Alps. The guidebook had mentioned that those reaching the summit for the first time were likely to be birched, but it sounded like a myth. Not so. On a sunny September morning, I found myself clambering up Triglav on a hiking holiday in this lush and lovely country, which escaped the Balkan conflict that engulfed neighbouring Croatia and Bosnia in the Nineties. I was one of a motley threesome that had teamed up spontaneously to bag the mountain: the others were Ralph, an unemployed German economist in his thirties, and 65-year-old Milan, a Slovenian psychologist from the capital Ljubljana. We arrived at the top just in time to see an Austrian being whacked on the backside with a climbing rope, watched by clusters of jovial Slovenes applauding and singing a folk song in approval. Before we could even take a picture of the fabulous view or nibble a celebratory muesli bar, Milan had borrowed the rope and put first me and then Ralph over his knee for a ritual Triglav thrashing. Can you imagine such behaviour in Snowdonia or the Lake District? Outrageous. In Slovenia it was just another casual laugh to contribute to the genial, party atmosphere that prevails on top of Triglav most mornings in good weather as dozens of Slovenes, and usually a handful of tourists, follow the well-worn route to the top. Climbing Triglav is something of a Slovenian tradition and akin to a patriotic rite of passage for the young - the downside is the presence of small memorials dotting the route, marking the point at which teenagers climbing alone or in groups have been swept off by avalanche or stumbled to their deaths. The Slovenes dubbed the mountain 'Old Mr Three Heads' centuries ago when its lumpy summit was thought to represent a triple-headed deity that ruled the sky, the earth and the underworld. Its 2,863-metre peak was first scaled in 1778 and features prominently on the national flag. Milan was ascending for the 49th time, having first made the summit at 13. Ralph and I had met the night before in the spartan mountain hostel three-quarters of the way up the mountain over goulash with macaroni and sausages - perfect examples of the culinary influences of Slovenia's neighbours, Hungary, Italy and Austria. Most people trying for Triglav stay at the hostel after a day's steep trek up from lush pasture, through pine woods, past scree and sheer limestone to the little hut offering food and a bunk. We set off for the top at 6.30 the following morning, heading into clear blue sky with the rising sun. Milan, a veteran of Mont Blanc, Kilimanjaro and 49 previous assaults on Triglav went first. We hauled ourselves up by a series of metal spikes and cables, embedded in the rock by the army on military exercises years ago. Milan stopped for us to rest and survey the spectacular surrounding peaks, blue in the early morning with traces of snow. The sunlight reflected off the beautiful Lake Bled in the valley miles below, resembling a shining, silver penny. 'Amazing,' I said. 'Amazing Grace!' he said eccentrically and started whistling it. He held his arms out as if to embrace his homeland. 'I feel like the Queen! Call me Elizabeth!' he shouted from under his purple bobble hat. A gasping Ralph brought up the rear. He had already moaned about his beer gut holding him back and a lack of sleep on account of all the blokes in his dormitory snoring. He looked rough. 'I'm hanging in there... like a boxer,' he panted, leaning heavily on the cables. 'I think this is the first time I climb Triglav - and the last.' Milan tutted as we precariously picked our way up the steep rock past the memorials. 'These shouldn't be up here, they should be down in the valley,' he said. The mountain is a pimple compared with the likes of Mont Blanc, which is almost 2,000 metres higher. But people still die on Triglav each year. The Julian Alps were named for Julius Caesar, after the Romans annexed Slovenia from Trieste in the second century. Milan declared that the relaxed and friendly atmosphere among the area's people was evidence of the warming social and climatic influence of the nearby Mediterranean over naturally conservative and somewhat chilly alpine instincts. Tourists see the locals' ready smiles and enjoy the slow pace of life which belie the fact that Slovenia, as an associate member of the European Union, is desperately trying to modernise. Small family farms and vineyards are already in decline. Milan, who retrains the unemployed, said many farmers worked in factories in the morning and on their land in the afternoons to make ends meet. His dream was to see Slovenia follow in the footsteps of the Irish Republic, whose electronics and software industries had boomed under EU assistance but had still kept its farming traditions.

      "byline": "Michael Freedland",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Five stars, says the brochure. 'Nonsense,' I say to my staff as I begin my tour of duty as manager of the hotel. 'Make that five smiles.' Much more important, I think. I am going to be tough and this is a good time to start. The guests at Chewton Glen have to know who is boss. </p> <p>'Clock in,' says the managing director. </p> <p>'Clock in? Me? I'm supposed to be the manager.' </p> <p>'Clock in,' he says. </p> <p>It is a gesture of equality that doesn't fit in with the air of \u00e9litism that goes with the name, one of those hotels far more people know about than have ever visited - an establishment nestling in the Hampshire countryside eight or nine miles from Bournemouth. </p> <p>I decide not to alter the clocking-in rule. This is a place brimful with tradition and I have to be careful. But there are going to be changes all right. I'm the governor, after all. If only for a day. </p> <p>The idea of being boss goes hand in hand with that word 'manager'. Everyone who has ever stayed at a top hotel knows that the manager is king. Or, at least, Crown Prince to the owner of the establishment. </p> <p>He may come round to see if you're enjoying his hospitality, but there's something foreboding about his presence along the corridors, in the entrance lobby or talking to the guests at dinner. If he's doing his job properly, it should be you who hopes that he's happy. If he is, then it's probably a pretty good hotel. </p> <p>It's that smile factor, I mention at my first meeting in the job. If you think that the porters , waiters or chambermaids really mean it when they say they hope you're having a good time, they'll smile a lot. </p> <p>'We have to exploit that,' I declare at the meeting. 'We have to let people know that our staff are smiling.' It is my first executive decision. </p> <p>I did know that I had left it late for a career change. There wasn't a lot of time to go the usual route - starting as a pantry boy, rising to a room-service waiter, having a go at the reception desk, taking my turn as a food and beverage manager. I have to cover a lot of ground in 12 hours. </p> <p>It isn't all glamour. At least, not at 7.30am, a time with which I am not overly familiar. But this rather lovely 60-bedroom hotel standing in its own grounds - golf course and croquet pitch included - needs looking after and I realise that sacrifices have to be made. </p> <p>I put on my regulation manager's blue suit, polish my shoes - the footwear of Peter Crome, the managing director, who is, in effect, general manager, are somewhat bigger, so I decide not to step into them for too long - and set to work on behalf of all those needy people who booked into Chewton Glen. </p> <p><strong> 7.30am</strong> is precisely the time I am expected to clock-in - along with the deputy manager, the chef, the doorkeeper, the chamber maids. </p> <p>It is, says Crome, only right. 'You can't tell people off for being late if you don't do yourself what they are expected to do.' I am not planning to tell anyone off. Honest. But this is a democracy after all (which hotels decidedly are not, but that's beside the point). </p> <p>The clock adjoins the massive, sparkling kitchens. 'The heart of the hotel,' says my mentor. There are pictures of all the employees - including Crome. A quick look over the kitchen, watch the breakfasts being prepared and then to... </p> <p><strong> 8am: </strong> The office. The computer is switched on. There are emails to be gone through. Nothing very significant, I note (thinks: hope Crome feels the same way). There are people booking for next year's summer holidays, a note from a man in Canada wanting a job, a sales report from the firm in London who go visiting prospective customers on my behalf - good results, I note. </p> <p>It's all interrupted at... </p> <p><strong> 9am</strong> (a time of which I have more personal experience): I see new guests arriving. </p> <p>'My' office is situated behind french doors leading on to the elegant flower-draped drive, down which the arrivals come. A porter is there to welcome them. But I have to be there, too, if I can. </p> <p>I dash over. 'Welcome,' I say. 'How are you? I hope you had a good journey.' Astonishing, I think, how quickly I master the lines. Crome, of course, has rather more experience and knew the words better. He remembers to say, 'I hope you have a very enjoyable stay with us.' Gee, I wish I'd said that. </p> <p>Then I get worried. The porter has vanished. Crome offers to show them to their room. That, I could have done. 'Let me take your cases.' I didn't wish I'd said that. Clocking in is one thing. Carrying luggage, surely not. 'Oh yes,' says Crome, who was previously manager at the Savoy and at St Andrews. 'No manager should regard that as beneath him.' I was about to succumb after muttering another question to the guests who had driven in their Bentley from Belgium. Fortunately, the porter arrives in time to take the bags. </p> <p><strong> 9.15am:</strong> I go with the couple to their room - so large, neither realises the other one is in there at the same time. Two balconies. Bathroom, twin sinks, big bath and, in a gesture of togetherness I'd never seen before, twin showers. They say they are satisfied. If they hadn't been, I'd have been tempted to roll up my sleeves and invite the gentleman outside, but managers in five-star (sorry five-smile) hotels are not expected to do that. Chewton Glen is decidedly not Fawlty Towers. </p> <p><strong> 9.30am: </strong> I escape in time for a meeting. Discuss the arrival of new guests, including the lady and gentleman from Belgium and five new unrelated people called Smith and four called Day. I hazard the thought that those names might not be on the people's birth certificates. I am assured that they don't need to do that sort of thing any more. The Bank of Bermuda has a group in. I'm told that five are classified as VIPs (which means special service, a bottle of champagne, flowers and fruit.). There's a wedding today. The bride is in room 42. The bridegroom has not yet arrived. We're pleased to know that a couple who come for one night have cancelled their week abroad and are staying at Chewton Glen instead. Andrew, today's duty manager, promises to look after them. But what about that wedding? Stuart Van Dam, the man in charge of functions, says there's nothing to worry about. Besides, there's a wedding meeting this afternoon to discuss future wedding policy. </p> <p>Things are going well, it seems. The night before, Peter received the Conde NastBest Hotel And Spa In The UK award. My staff smile appreciatively. </p> <p>The health club manager, Clive McNash, reports nobody has actually been boiled alive in his department and that they're serving carrot soup in the restaurant overlooking the swimming pool - 4ft 6in deep throughout, but long enough to need binoculars to see the other end. We agree that every guest enjoys being met at the door. 'It's the one moment when people feel vulnerable,' says Crome. I feel distinctly vulnerable myself at this stage. </p> <p>There's a phone call from HM Customs and Excise. They want to know about the aeroplane that was seen near the golf course..I have to ask the groundsman if he has noticed anything. He says he hasn't, but one guest wants to come in his helicopter. A spot is sorted out near the car park. </p> <p>We have to talk about gifts to long-staying guests. </p> <p><strong> 10am: </strong> The others go and my secretary, Angela Day, arrives. I decide I don't want to change the pens provided in each room. A firm wants to sell me a new line. They would cost more than \u00a31 each - and since they usually check out at round about the same time as the guests, I make my second executive decision. We won't buy them. </p> <p>She asks me if I am interested in the subscription to a magazine promising funny lines for public speeches. I decide I don't need that sort of help - which may surprise the guests who recently attended my son's wedding. </p> <p><strong> 10.30am:</strong> Somebody wants to book for the year 2002. We tell them the rate may change, but here's what the bill would be today. I choose the hotel's Christmas card. The maintenance man has problems with two clocks. I tell him I have every confidence in his ability to sort that out himself. </p> <p><strong> 11.50am</strong> I go into the kitchen. The chef Peter Chevillard has justly won most of the awards for which he could possibly qualify. I ask him how he spells his name and notice it has only one 'l' on his tunic. I am shocked and demand he gets a new identification embroidered. 'Good morning, chef,' I say and smile at the 26 people waiting in the kitchen, go through the list of 56 staff actually serving the food that day. I don' take any samples, but I trust chef to serve the lunch, Chewton Glen style, which is pretty good. </p> <p>I have a few minutes to spare. Peter Crome says this is when he writes his 'jolly old things' - individual notes of welcome to all the arrivals. </p> <p><strong> 12.20pm:</strong> Walk through the hotel. Talk to guests having coffee on the terrace. I engage a party of four women who appear to be very happy. It's the fortieth birthday of one of them. </p> <p><strong> 1pm:</strong> I'd like to pop my head round the morning room door, where the wedding ceremony is proceeding, but their privacy has to be respected. When the first lap of my tour is complete, the wedding guests are sipping champers on the terrace. Time to put the morning room back to its usual position. All the chairs have to be replaced the way they were before, a table has to be moved, curtains straightened. A lampshade needs adjusting. 'Aren't there people here to do that sort of thing?' I ask Crome. 'There are,' he says reassuringly, 'but they are busy. I want it to be just right - now.' </p> <p>An American couple are planning lunch. I recommend the smoked salmon. They accept my advice. </p> <p><strong> 1.30pm: </strong> Plan a snack in the health club. But before that, there's a problem. A guest is arranging his father's birthday party that night and wants to serenade him. </p> <p>'Do we, by any chance, have a violin he could borrow?' Crome, who plays in a local orchestra, produces his own instrument as if he were offering to lend the man a plug adapter. Someone else wants some binoculars. Well, of course, Crome has these, too.We look outside. It appears that the bride herself is going round the guests, serving canap\u00e9s - 'unless it's an over-dressed waitress,' says Crome. </p> <p><strong> 2.30pm:</strong> Wedding meeting. This goes on for longer than was originally planned. There's a lot to do, including selecting a new brochure. Business is much better than it used to be - a five-fold increase in four years. </p> <p>We have to limit weddings to small functions - mustn't spoil it for our other guests - and there's no dancing allowed. The new brochure could say that. I suggest that we should emphasise only the positive aspects - which I think is my third executive decision, since nobody said otherwise. The brochure could also include details of honeymoons, but I think that was a different matter entirely. I believe the meeting agrees with that, too. </p> <p>There is another problem: you can't have little girl bridesmaids - because children under six are banned from Chewton Glen. I'm told that few weddings at the hotel have bridesmaids anyway. </p> <p>'What do we charge?' I ask. For the ceremony, \u00a3424; \u00a3125.20 a head for up to 50 guests. This takes in the cost of every item on offer, a three-course dinner or lunch, canap\u00e9s and wedding cake (costed out at the rate of \u00a32.75 a slice ) but we get back to the brochure. I suggest that the menus be displayed as they would in the restaurant, not crowded on one page. Agreed. Another executive decision. 'What do we call the brochure?' 'A Truly Memorable Wedding,' says someone. 'Aren't all weddings memorable?' I ask. I suggest 'A Chewton Glen Wedding.' Everyone agrees. Executive decision number 5. </p> <p><strong> 3.45pm: </strong> Visit laundry room. Pleased to note that all the linens are washed in-house. More economical than the previous policy of leasing them from another company. I agree that \u00a320,000 spent on what looks like a large mangle, which presses the sheets, tablecloths and napkins, is a snip at the price. </p> <p>I check supplies and note that there are vats of enough washing liquid to start a Chewton Glen supermarket, although I would rather it remain an hotel. I check on the quantity of towels in use - 300 to 400 in the health club, 300 in the rooms. </p> <p><strong> 4.15pm:</strong> See the florist. She is happy that all the flowers are in place and the orders are ready for tomorrow. </p> <p><strong> 5.15pm:</strong> Go into a couple of empty rooms (there are really just two of these; none at all tomorrow). All's well. </p> <p><strong> 5.45pm:</strong> Welcome more guests. Crome doesn't have anything to worry about from me in this respect. He's got it down to a fine art and that could be the reason people feel at home so quickly. It's very easy to look unctuous. He does it just right. Plainly his time as a pantry boy paid off </p> <p><strong> 6.15pm:</strong> Go behind the front desk. Take call from prospective guests. 'Do you have a room for Christmas?' We have one suite available. I have the feeling that the man wants to kiss me. </p> <p><strong> 7.15pm:</strong> Go into the main restaurant and into the adjoining conservatory. </p> <p><strong> 7.30pm:</strong> Welcome the first guests. Go through the menu with an elderly American gentleman, who by now has much more energy than I. </p> <p>'What about dinner?' asks Peter Crome, who I don't think ever has time to eat himself. It's the most welcome question I've been asked all day. But first I go back to my room. My wife has had her massages, reflexology and is ready for dinner. I look at the king-size bed with a longing. </p> <p>We go to dinner. I tell Crome that his job is safe. </p> <p>'Don't bother to clock off,' he says. That's a relief.

      "bodyText": "Five stars, says the brochure. 'Nonsense,' I say to my staff as I begin my tour of duty as manager of the hotel. 'Make that five smiles.' Much more important, I think. I am going to be tough and this is a good time to start. The guests at Chewton Glen have to know who is boss. 'Clock in,' says the managing director. 'Clock in? Me? I'm supposed to be the manager.' 'Clock in,' he says. It is a gesture of equality that doesn't fit in with the air of \u00e9litism that goes with the name, one of those hotels far more people know about than have ever visited - an establishment nestling in the Hampshire countryside eight or nine miles from Bournemouth. I decide not to alter the clocking-in rule. This is a place brimful with tradition and I have to be careful. But there are going to be changes all right. I'm the governor, after all. If only for a day. The idea of being boss goes hand in hand with that word 'manager'. Everyone who has ever stayed at a top hotel knows that the manager is king. Or, at least, Crown Prince to the owner of the establishment. He may come round to see if you're enjoying his hospitality, but there's something foreboding about his presence along the corridors, in the entrance lobby or talking to the guests at dinner. If he's doing his job properly, it should be you who hopes that he's happy. If he is, then it's probably a pretty good hotel. It's that smile factor, I mention at my first meeting in the job. If you think that the porters , waiters or chambermaids really mean it when they say they hope you're having a good time, they'll smile a lot. 'We have to exploit that,' I declare at the meeting. 'We have to let people know that our staff are smiling.' It is my first executive decision. I did know that I had left it late for a career change. There wasn't a lot of time to go the usual route - starting as a pantry boy, rising to a room-service waiter, having a go at the reception desk, taking my turn as a food and beverage manager. I have to cover a lot of ground in 12 hours. It isn't all glamour. At least, not at 7.30am, a time with which I am not overly familiar. But this rather lovely 60-bedroom hotel standing in its own grounds - golf course and croquet pitch included - needs looking after and I realise that sacrifices have to be made. I put on my regulation manager's blue suit, polish my shoes - the footwear of Peter Crome, the managing director, who is, in effect, general manager, are somewhat bigger, so I decide not to step into them for too long - and set to work on behalf of all those needy people who booked into Chewton Glen. 7.30am is precisely the time I am expected to clock-in - along with the deputy manager, the chef, the doorkeeper, the chamber maids. It is, says Crome, only right. 'You can't tell people off for being late if you don't do yourself what they are expected to do.' I am not planning to tell anyone off. Honest. But this is a democracy after all (which hotels decidedly are not, but that's beside the point). The clock adjoins the massive, sparkling kitchens. 'The heart of the hotel,' says my mentor. There are pictures of all the employees - including Crome. A quick look over the kitchen, watch the breakfasts being prepared and then to... 8am: The office. The computer is switched on. There are emails to be gone through. Nothing very significant, I note (thinks: hope Crome feels the same way). There are people booking for next year's summer holidays, a note from a man in Canada wanting a job, a sales report from the firm in London who go visiting prospective customers on my behalf - good results, I note. It's all interrupted at... 9am (a time of which I have more personal experience): I see new guests arriving. 'My' office is situated behind french doors leading on to the elegant flower-draped drive, down which the arrivals come. A porter is there to welcome them. But I have to be there, too, if I can. I dash over. 'Welcome,' I say. 'How are you? I hope you had a good journey.' Astonishing, I think, how quickly I master the lines. Crome, of course, has rather more experience and knew the words better. He remembers to say, 'I hope you have a very enjoyable stay with us.' Gee, I wish I'd said that. Then I get worried. The porter has vanished. Crome offers to show them to their room. That, I could have done. 'Let me take your cases.' I didn't wish I'd said that. Clocking in is one thing. Carrying luggage, surely not. 'Oh yes,' says Crome, who was previously manager at the Savoy and at St Andrews. 'No manager should regard that as beneath him.' I was about to succumb after muttering another question to the guests who had driven in their Bentley from Belgium. Fortunately, the porter arrives in time to take the bags. 9.15am: I go with the couple to their room - so large, neither realises the other one is in there at the same time. Two balconies. Bathroom, twin sinks, big bath and, in a gesture of togetherness I'd never seen before, twin showers. They say they are satisfied. If they hadn't been, I'd have been tempted to roll up my sleeves and invite the gentleman outside, but managers in five-star (sorry five-smile) hotels are not expected to do that. Chewton Glen is decidedly not Fawlty Towers. 9.30am: I escape in time for a meeting. Discuss the arrival of new guests, including the lady and gentleman from Belgium and five new unrelated people called Smith and four called Day. I hazard the thought that those names might not be on the people's birth certificates. I am assured that they don't need to do that sort of thing any more. The Bank of Bermuda has a group in. I'm told that five are classified as VIPs (which means special service, a bottle of champagne, flowers and fruit.). There's a wedding today. The bride is in room 42. The bridegroom has not yet arrived. We're pleased to know that a couple who come for one night have cancelled their week abroad and are staying at Chewton Glen instead. Andrew, today's duty manager, promises to look after them. But what about that wedding? Stuart Van Dam, the man in charge of functions, says there's nothing to worry about. Besides, there's a wedding meeting this afternoon to discuss future wedding policy. Things are going well, it seems. The night before, Peter received the Conde NastBest Hotel And Spa In The UK award. My staff smile appreciatively. The health club manager, Clive McNash, reports nobody has actually been boiled alive in his department and that they're serving carrot soup in the restaurant overlooking the swimming pool - 4ft 6in deep throughout, but long enough to need binoculars to see the other end. We agree that every guest enjoys being met at the door. 'It's the one moment when people feel vulnerable,' says Crome. I feel distinctly vulnerable myself at this stage. There's a phone call from HM Customs and Excise. They want to know about the aeroplane that was seen near the golf course..I have to ask the groundsman if he has noticed anything. He says he hasn't, but one guest wants to come in his helicopter. A spot is sorted out near the car park. We have to talk about gifts to long-staying guests. 10am: The others go and my secretary, Angela Day, arrives. I decide I don't want to change the pens provided in each room. A firm wants to sell me a new line. They would cost more than \u00a31 each - and since they usually check out at round about the same time as the guests, I make my second executive decision. We won't buy them. She asks me if I am interested in the subscription to a magazine promising funny lines for public speeches. I decide I don't need that sort of help - which may surprise the guests who recently attended my son's wedding. 10.30am: Somebody wants to book for the year 2002. We tell them the rate may change, but here's what the bill would be today. I choose the hotel's Christmas card. The maintenance man has problems with two clocks. I tell him I have every confidence in his ability to sort that out himself. 11.50am I go into the kitchen. The chef Peter Chevillard has justly won most of the awards for which he could possibly qualify. I ask him how he spells his name and notice it has only one 'l' on his tunic. I am shocked and demand he gets a new identification embroidered. 'Good morning, chef,' I say and smile at the 26 people waiting in the kitchen, go through the list of 56 staff actually serving the food that day. I don' take any samples, but I trust chef to serve the lunch, Chewton Glen style, which is pretty good. I have a few minutes to spare. Peter Crome says this is when he writes his 'jolly old things' - individual notes of welcome to all the arrivals. 12.20pm: Walk through the hotel. Talk to guests having coffee on the terrace. I engage a party of four women who appear to be very happy. It's the fortieth birthday of one of them. 1pm: I'd like to pop my head round the morning room door, where the wedding ceremony is proceeding, but their privacy has to be respected. When the first lap of my tour is complete, the wedding guests are sipping champers on the terrace. Time to put the morning room back to its usual position. All the chairs have to be replaced the way they were before, a table has to be moved, curtains straightened. A lampshade needs adjusting. 'Aren't there people here to do that sort of thing?' I ask Crome. 'There are,' he says reassuringly, 'but they are busy. I want it to be just right - now.' An American couple are planning lunch. I recommend the smoked salmon. They accept my advice. 1.30pm: Plan a snack in the health club. But before that, there's a problem. A guest is arranging his father's birthday party that night and wants to serenade him.

Duty Free may have gone, and the price of cross-Channel travel may have risen, but bargain hunters have adapted; they travel less but shop more to compensate for the rise in fares, and even trade up on the quality of the wine they buy. The reasons are compelling: there are no longer any limits (other than the customs and excise advisory guidelines) on the amount of alcohol and tobacco that can be brought back for personal use. Champagne averages \u00a36.50 a bottle cheaper. Wine costs between \u00a31.50 and \u00a33 per bottle less. Beer too, especially continental brands, can be as little as 12p for a 25cl bottle.

No, not Roy Keane's latest sneer at Manchester United's corporate supporters, but misplaced wit advertising a Vodafone competition in the match programme. </p> <p>'Fancy watching a game from a hospitality box,' ran the copy under a most topically arresting headline. 'If you want the chance to cheer on the Reds with a posh pie in one hand and a bottle of bubbly in the other, you'd better get hold of a Man Utd mobile.' </p> <p>And stay away from a cer tain volatile Irishman, though Keane is partly off-beam in blaming gentrification for the lack of backing against Kiev. For one thing United did not play well, as Sir Alex Ferguson has admitted, and several fans have pointed out that it's hard to sing and bite your nails at the same time. </p> <p>Secondly, it is seating that has turned down the terrace volume. To judge by some comments this week, one might imagine United audiences were now indistinguishable from those at Glyndebourne or Twickenham. Be reassured that this is emphatically not the case. </p> <p>Predictably the crowd were in better voice here, at least until Christian Karembeu's first goal in English football gave Middlesbrough an unlikely lead. The extent of the visitors' attacking ambitions up to that point appeared to be nil, best exemplified when Phil Stamp dis possessed Nicky Butt 30 yards out but wasted his good position with a shot that did not even require a save. </p> <p>United's own attempts on goal did not amount to much more, however, despite Keane's exhortations. Boro seemed to arrive at the conclusion they were not playing superhumans but a side going through a rough patch of their own. United also began with player of the month Teddy Sheringham on the bench, and by the time he came on for the injured Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, they were chasing the game. </p> <p>Once more Butt was caught in possession 30 yards out, this time by Karembeu, who played a neat ball out to Hamilton Ricard on the right and advanced to meet the return with a shot coolly lifted over United's keeper Fabien Barthez. </p> <p>Mikael Silvestre had the best chance of equalising before half-time but headed into the ground from six yards, and United's situation hardly improved when Wes Brown failed to appear for the second half. </p> <p>Peter Taylor will not be surprised to learn he will be unavailable to England on Wednesday, and as the prob lem concerns the knee that was operated on for cruciate ligament damage last season, even Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson ought to be concerned. 'He couldn't continue,' Ferguson said. 'There was no point taking risks.' Keane also withdrew from the Ireland squad with a tight hamstring. </p> <p>For the record, the supporters got behind United before they got back in the game. It was beginning to look as if it might be a luckless day when the normally reliable Scholes missed two clear opportunities in quick succession, but the home side had a let-off when Andy Campbell shot narrowly wide after 54 minutes. </p> <p>United are not in the habit of worrying about single-goal deficits until injury time at least. Fittingly it was the tireless Keane who laid on the equaliser, crossing sharply from the right to pick out Butt in front of goal. </p> <p>Three minutes later United were in front and you wondered what all the fuss had been about, Sheringham inevitably finding himself in the right place to beat Mark Schwarzer when Yorke's shot was blocked. </p> <p>'United are without doubt the best side in the country at chasing a game,' Boro manager Bryan Robson admitted. He can again take some comfort from a narrow defeat by a top-three side, but knows the crux comes with the next two games, at home against Leicester and Bradford. </p> <p>'We should have most of our players back then,' he said. 'We just need to carry on working this hard.'</p>",

United also began with player of the month Teddy Sheringham on the bench, and by the time he came on for the injured Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, they were chasing the game. Once more Butt was caught in possession 30 yards out, this time by Karembeu, who played a neat ball out to Hamilton Ricard on the right and advanced to meet the return with a shot coolly lifted over United's keeper Fabien Barthez. Mikael Silvestre had the best chance of equalising before half-time but headed into the ground from six yards, and United's situation hardly improved when Wes Brown failed to appear for the second half. Peter Taylor will not be surprised to learn he will be unavailable to England on Wednesday, and as the prob lem concerns the knee that was operated on for cruciate ligament damage last season, even Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson ought to be concerned. 'He couldn't continue,' Ferguson said. 'There was no point taking risks.' Keane also withdrew from the Ireland squad with a tight hamstring. For the record, the supporters got behind United before they got back in the game. It was beginning to look as if it might be a luckless day when the normally reliable Scholes missed two clear opportunities in quick succession, but the home side had a let-off when Andy Campbell shot narrowly wide after 54 minutes. United are not in the habit of worrying about single-goal deficits until injury time at least. Fittingly it was the tireless Keane who laid on the equaliser, crossing sharply from the right to pick out Butt in front of goal. Three minutes later United were in front and you wondered what all the fuss had been about, Sheringham inevitably finding himself in the right place to beat Mark Schwarzer when Yorke's shot was blocked. 'United are without doubt the best side in the country at chasing a game,' Boro manager Bryan Robson admitted. He can again take some comfort from a narrow defeat by a top-three side, but knows the crux comes with the next two games, at home against Leicester and Bradford. 'We should have most of our players back then,' he said. 'We just need to carry on working this hard.'",

The Chancellor may not have walked around St James's Park in the spring daffodils or waved his red box to the cameramen as he left Number 11, but this was no stocktaking or consultation exercise. This was the full Monty, deploying \u00a35.7 billion in tax cuts and spending increases, as much as in a typical recent British budget.</p> <p>Of course giving \u00a32.25bn to the fuel lobby and another \u00a32.5bn to pensioners was a political act, but that is only a term of abuse for the Government's enemies and for those who believe policy should be determined by technocrats operating a definition of the public interest that they make up themselves.</p> <p>Strategically, the Government had to draw the sting from the petrol protesters in the short term while drawing up plans in the medium term that would better insulate the country from the effects of further picketing of fuel depots. As for pensioners, there is every reason that they should share in the rise in general living standards and, given the extent of the budget surplus, have a proper claim on the Government's largesse. The same principle should extend to all those on income support.</p> <p>However, the big point stands. Elected governments, not unelected interest groups, must determine policy. It is better to make some concessions now to preserve that principle, at the price of partly validating the charge that you give in to whoever shouts loudest, than take a position which you might have to abandon, thus putting the principle at risk. The chances are that public support for the protesters is diminishing, but in a volatile climate nobody can be certain. It is better for the Government to take one step back and secure its position for moving forwards than to lose ground through intransigence.</p> <p>The question remains as to whether the Government could have shaped its concessions better to protect the long-term public interest. The correct transport policy surely has to be to raise the capital cost of car and lorry ownership, to tax congestion, to provide high-quality public transport and to tilt fuel taxation to favour low pollutant fuels while not making the overall burden excessive. The Government is on firm ground on the last two elements. Public transport is to receive huge investment over the coming three years and on Wednesday the Chancellor focused his duty cuts on low-sulphur fuels. So far so good.</p> <p>However, proposing to more than halve lorry excise duties while doing nothing to advance the cause of congestion charging was surely wrong, leading to a situation where an already over- large road-haulage industry will become larger, with nothing to deter lorry use of roads at peak times.</p> <p>This was a bribe too far. It would have been better for the Chancellor to have spent the cash on cutting fuel duties further and to have held the line on vehicle excise duty if he felt that talking congestion charges at the moment (which I guess was the reason for avoiding the subject) was too inflammatory.</p> <p>But on pensions, the Government has developed an almost unassailable interim position, closing down the argument for the time being from internal critics and the Tories alike. The increases in the basic state pension are long overdue, and lifting the minimum income guarantee (MIG) substantially while pledging to index its growth to earnings over the next parliament is hardly contestable. Pension incomes next year for the poorest 10 per cent who claim MIG (most do not, on principle, because it is means-tested) will rise by 8 per cent in real terms.</p> <p>And this is the rub. Pensions, like the Schleswig-Holstein question, are understood by almost nobody - pensioners, policy-makers and commentators alike. For example, there is little recognition, even in the Treasury and the Department of Social Security, that individual saving for retirement has recently become a disaster. Returns on the equity market over the past three years have been derisory while annuity rates have plummeted, a conjunction that most actuaries expect to continue and which is dramatically lowering pension incomes from saving. In other words, every citizen has not only a right to expect a solid, easily understood, universal, protected-from-government-discretion, non-means-tested income in retirement ( the basic pension indexed to earnings growth ), but in future most pensioners will need it more rather than less. The argument will return again, but given the scale of the increases this year and next in the basic pension, not until after the next election.</p> <p>As for the rest of the budget, it is full of small good things. SureStart has more cash. There are some innovative twists to employment policy, including more focus on coaching and mentoring the unemployed and a new agency to help them find and stay in work, two initiatives that the Industrial Society (I declare an interest as its chief executive) has been recommending. And there is a raft of useful interventions aimed at urban regeneration, notably exempting property from stamp duty in rundown areas and accepting the idea that there should be a tax credit for investment in depressed communities.</p> <p>And yet. As you pick your way through the welter of well-intentioned initiatives and accompanying logos, you long for something that captures the imagination and is informed by an overarching idea of what the good society might be. 'Urban renewal' is a classic example. The new agency and coaching for the unemployed, the stamp duty exemption, the proposed tax credit - all are useful intermediate policy instruments. But they are not joined up in practice, nor informed by an inspirational vision. We need, as Richard Rogers and Anne Power argue in Cities For a Small Country, to revolutionise our entire conception of what urban life might mean. If we wanted, we could reinvent how we live in cities, how we associate, how we travel and how we work, a step-change in what urban life means, and which the budget's measures might serve. Instead, the measures seem micro and crabby, passing a sceptical Treasury official's test but not a citizen's. Equally, if you take some of the other great issues - the rise of corporate power or the need to reinvent the notion of public service - the Government has little to say.</p> <p>But we should celebrate the good. What we are now witnessing economically is unique. Investment is the highest it has been for 30 years. Unemployment is set to drop below a million.

This company uses complicated instruments called derivatives to protect investors' capital and provide the return. The change in performances of the two indices over five years will be added together and divided by two. This figure will be multiplied by 75 per cent to produce the amount paid out to investors. The start level of each index will be its closing level on 13 December. To guard against a sudden fall in the stock markets as the investment nears maturity in December 2005, HSBC will calculate the final levels by taking the average of the closing levels of each index over the last 12 months. Investors who withdraw money early may not get the full amount back. </p> <p><strong> Minimum:</strong> \u00a33,000 to a maximum of \u00a37,000. </p> <p><strong> Charges: </strong> Built in to the product. </p> <p><strong> Tax: </strong> Tax-free returns through HSBC's mini or maxi Isa. </p> <p><strong> Risk: </strong> Low </p> <p><strong> Should you buy it?: </strong> Ian Beestin of Nottingham based ISA Shop says: 'We think you should invest in something you can understand, and it's difficult to quantify the risk here.

Donna Bradshaw of London-based Fiona Price &amp; Partners agrees: 'This type of investment is popular with nervous investors dipping their toes in the equity market, but there are better ways to fulfil their need for security.' </p> <p><strong> Points out of 10: </strong> Beestin - 3, Bradshaw - 4.</p>",

Bells &amp; whistles: The lowest average return for the two indices over any five-year period since December 1991, when the Dow Jones Eurostoxx 50 index was introduced, is 66.74 per cent, while the highest has been 211.43 per cent. How it works: Investors' money is used to buy shares in a Dublin-listed investment company, HSBC International Equity Plus 8. This company uses complicated instruments called derivatives to protect investors' capital and provide the return. The change in performances of the two indices over five years will be added together and divided by two. This figure will be multiplied by 75 per cent to produce the amount paid out to investors. The start level of each index will be its closing level on 13 December. To guard against a sudden fall in the stock markets as the investment nears maturity in December 2005, HSBC will calculate the final levels by taking the average of the closing levels of each index over the last 12 months. Investors who withdraw money early may not get the full amount back. Minimum: \u00a33,000 to a maximum of \u00a37,000. Charges: Built in to the product. Tax: Tax-free returns through HSBC's mini or maxi Isa. Risk: Low Should you buy it?: Ian Beestin of Nottingham based ISA Shop says: 'We think you should invest in something you can understand, and it's difficult to quantify the risk here. There's no opportunity to time your exit and 25 per cent of the return is a high price for capital protection. You would be better off with a cash Isa and a mini Isa tracking the FTSE All Share.' Donna Bradshaw of London-based Fiona Price &amp; Partners agrees: 'This type of investment is popular with nervous investors dipping their toes in the equity market, but there are better ways to fulfil their need for security.' Points out of 10: Beestin - 3, Bradshaw - 4.",

      "body": "<p>Robert Redford enters the Manhattan hotel room smiling, blond, trim, casual, a bit craggy at 63 but pretty much as you expect. The legendary mystique is intact. His cultivated superstardom has made the actor-director-producer a kind of totem in the annals of Hollywood stereotyping. Redford, after all, always has been Redford - the way Gable was Gable, Cooper was Cooper, William Powell was William Powell. </p> <p>Redford is his own man, and his own model, too - and he does not deviate from it much. Younger stars push the envelope: Tom Cruise has done Magnolia and Eyes Wide Shut, Brad Pitt 12 Monkeys and even Matt Damon - seemingly the most Redfordian of them all - was in The Talented Mr. Ripley, although his sexually ambivalent homicidal maniac was the most sympathetic sociopath you had ever seen. </p> <p>Damon, not coincidentally, is the star of The Legend of Bagger Vance (pictured), Redford's sixth film as a director - the area of Redford's career where he has stretched himself. In the Oscar-winning Ordinary People (1980) or the much-honoured Quiz Show ( 1994) or even his last, The Horse Whisperer (1998), Redford exhibits more daring than he ever did in his choice of movie roles, although nobility, or a grasping for nobility, is afoot in all his work. </p> <p>In Bagger Vance, a Jazz Age golden boy (Damon), a golfing sensation, goes off to the First World War, has his ideals shot out from under him and returns a broken man. With the aid of a mysterious caddie named Bagger (Will Smith), he strives to regain his swing, his soul and his girl (Charlize Theron). </p> <p>Redford did fly fishing in A River Runs Through It ( 1992). Maybe a movie about golf is not so strange. And maybe golf isn't the attraction at all. 'No, that would not interest me,' he says. 'First of all, it's everywhere. It's ubiquitous. You turn on the Golf Channel. Airlines. It's everywhere.' </p> <p>Some would suggest that's just the reason to do it. 'Yeah, but it wouldn't be mine,' he says. 'But golf as a metaphor for life does interest me.' </p> <p>Bagger Vance is based on a novel by Steven Pressfield (screenplay by Jeremy Leven) and what Redford found in it was the way to create a story in a classic form: the hero's fall into darkness and his struggle to return to the light. Pressfield, Redford says, borrowed heavily from the Bhagavad-Gita and other Eastern sources, as well as Western mythology 'and the part that interested me was the part that related to the character's battle with himself, the idea of focus, concentration, centre, what we now hear of as \"the zone\" - the way an athlete gets into the zone. </p> <p>'I was intrigued by that. And I saw that the book was full of wonderful raw material. That's how I saw it. I don't know that I would ever be so interested in doing a book verbatim. I'd have to make it my own somehow.' </p> <p>He also needed a break after the gravity of The Horse Whisperer . 'I was looking for something uplifting, as much for myself as anything else. Because that was a heavy trip. Even though it had some positive aspects to it, it was about healing, it involved damaged animals, children, and was a hard, heavy movie to make. </p> <p>'So I thought next time, I'd like to do something quirky. Entertaining but quirky... And also, the whole atmosphere up there at the festival, I could see things were getting darker and darker, more and more cynical. I thought, maybe it's not a bad idea to do something kind of uplifting.' </p> <p>The festival, of course, is Sundance, with which Redford has been involved since the mid-Eighties, when his Sundance Institute (he was, after all, the Sundance Kid) took over the existing US Film Festival. His presence there has been erratic, almost shadowy; in an effort not to eclipse the filmmakers, he has become its resident phantom. </p> <p>'It would be nice, just for my ego, for people to know how hard I work on it,' Redford says. 'I spend a lot of time on it, preparing for it every year, and we always have a post-mortem afterwards, taking a hard look at what went wrong, or what could have been better. Refining it. </p> <p>'And, of course, starting it was not an easy thing,' he adds. 'For three years, nobody was even interested. For those years, I would literally stand out on the corner and collar people to get them into theatres. I remember going to David Puttnam when he was at Columbia and saying, \"I want you to come see The Big Easy\". I just liked [director] Jim McBride's early work and I knew McBride had had a really rough go, hadn't made a film in a few years. So I dragged Puttnam in there, literally forced him into the theatre.' </p> <p>Puttnam bought the movie. 'And that was the first big buy at the festival,' he says. And almost immediately, Redford started taking a backseat 'because I thought, \"If it's going to go it'll go on its own\". And when it did I was really thrilled. I thought, \"This is great. I can just go watch the movies\". 'It's a great chance for me to watch movies, meet the filmmakers. That's the biggest joy for me.' </p> <p>Redford is himself, of course, an independent filmmaker, one with carefully wrought ideas and a genuine cinematic palette: The opening sequence in Horse Whisperer, for example, is an elegiac daydream of half-tones and impressionism; Quiz Show recreates its era of early TV with effortless grace. </p> <p>In Bagger Vance, the mood and tones change as fast and furiously as the story elements, which set up the film with a kind of ragtime staccato that suggests The Sting. </p> <p>'I didn't think The Sting,' but you're right,' Redford says. 'I wanted to do it like an old Thirties movie, high-energy, fast-paced, full of life, very Chekhovian, the rug being pulled out constantly from people. \"Oh, we're going this way? No, we're goin' that way...\" That's fun for me and I wanted to do something with more humour. </p> <p>'So I thought, \"I have a hell of a deal here. I have to set up Bagger Vance, set up the narrator looking back on himself as a boy, the townsfolk, the conditions under which the hero falls into darkness, the First World War - can't spend much time there 'cause it's not about the war, but you have to have it.\" I thought, \"How am I going to do it?\" And I thought the only way was to compress it and have it almost like a title sequence, like a preface, where you say to the audience, we're not going to stop anywhere very long.' </p> <p>The war sequence? 'Well, with [cinematographer] Michael Ballhaus, I shot in 8mm, step-frame, 16mm, 35mm, slow-mo. I threw everything in there to create an impressionistic feel for that war in one minute, which is all it lasts in the film.' </p> <p>He also had to set up the characters of Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill), two of the greatest golfers of their age and polar opposites in temperament - Jones the Righteous, Hagen the Moral Reprobate, both of whom are pressganged into playing a benefit match for the Depression-besieged golf resort owned by Adele Invergordon (Theron). Under pressure from the town fathers, Adele also has to include a local entry in her tournament, Rannulph Junuh, Damon's tarnished golden boy, Adele's ex and a golfer who, according to Bagger, has lost his 'authentic swing'. </p> <p>'What really got me, when I heard the story being told, was the phrase \"the authentic swing\",' Redford says. 'Somehow, it's this quirky thing, how you approach a piece of work: sometimes it's just a word, a phrase; sometimes it's the turning of a corner.' </p> <p>Bagger Vance, Redford says, was a chance to get even more into visual storytelling, using single images that would carry a lot of story, like the comic strips he followed when he was a kid, growing up in Santa Monica, the son of a milkman. 'That was one of the few entertainments I had,' Redford says. 'Well, I had radio. But we were a pretty working, lower-class family where there wasn't a lot. We were in a Mexican neighbourhood. It was fairly grim. There were no class distinctions, because we were united by the war effort. These weren't happy times; nobody had much. The library's where I got into this mythology. But how the people came together was radio, or the funny papers. Sunday was a huge deal. You'd go racing for the funnies. Without knowing it, I was very connected to them.' </p> <p>Redford has directed a few films, starred in scores more. But if you had to guess it would be directing that has his heart. </p> <p>'Originally,' he says, 'when I first got involved in Bagger Vance I thought of it as something I would be in. But quickly I decided against that because when I started to read the book it had too many parallels to The Natural . I've sort of been there. And I was more interested in a younger cast because it might be more affecting to have this happen to a very young person. It reminded me of A.E. Housman's poem 'A Shropshire Lad', an ode to an athlete who dies young. I remembered being moved by the fact that this guy goes out in a moment of glory, and maybe that was the best time to go out, 'cause after that it's all downhill...' </p> <p><strong>Redford, the director</strong></p> <p><strong> ORDINARY PEOPLE (1980)</strong> <br> Redford's directorial debut, a sombre drama about a grief-stricken family, won him an Oscar. It also marked him out as a major player behind the camera following a decade as one of Hollywood's biggest box-office draws. </p> <p><strong> A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992)</strong> <br>Brad Pitt looked suspiciously like the young Redford in this tale of fraternal friendship and fly fishing set in picturesque Montana. Pitt played the small-town rebel destined for a tragic end. </p> <p><strong> QUIZ SHOW (1994)</strong> <br>An intelligent morality tale based on the infamous Fifties' US television quiz scandals. Ralph Fiennes played the handsome patrician who cheated his way to fame and fortune before falling from grace. </p> <p><strong> THE HORSE WHISPERER (1998)</strong> <br>An epic melodrama based on Nicholas Evans's bestseller. Redford starred as the laconic cowboy with healing hands who is hired to help a horse and its traumatised teenage owner.</p>",

I have to set up Bagger Vance, set up the narrator looking back on himself as a boy, the townsfolk, the conditions under which the hero falls into darkness, the First World War - can't spend much time there 'cause it's not about the war, but you have to have it.\" I thought, \"How am I going to do it?\" And I thought the only way was to compress it and have it almost like a title sequence, like a preface, where you say to the audience, we're not going to stop anywhere very long.' The war sequence? 'Well, with [cinematographer] Michael Ballhaus, I shot in 8mm, step-frame, 16mm, 35mm, slow-mo. I threw everything in there to create an impressionistic feel for that war in one minute, which is all it lasts in the film.' He also had to set up the characters of Bobby Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill), two of the greatest golfers of their age and polar opposites in temperament - Jones the Righteous, Hagen the Moral Reprobate, both of whom are pressganged into playing a benefit match for the Depression-besieged golf resort owned by Adele Invergordon (Theron). Under pressure from the town fathers, Adele also has to include a local entry in her tournament, Rannulph Junuh, Damon's tarnished golden boy, Adele's ex and a golfer who, according to Bagger, has lost his 'authentic swing'. 'What really got me, when I heard the story being told, was the phrase \"the authentic swing\",' Redford says. 'Somehow, it's this quirky thing, how you approach a piece of work: sometimes it's just a word, a phrase; sometimes it's the turning of a corner.' Bagger Vance, Redford says, was a chance to get even more into visual storytelling, using single images that would carry a lot of story, like the comic strips he followed when he was a kid, growing up in Santa Monica, the son of a milkman. 'That was one of the few entertainments I had,' Redford says. 'Well, I had radio. But we were a pretty working, lower-class family where there wasn't a lot. We were in a Mexican neighbourhood. It was fairly grim. There were no class distinctions, because we were united by the war effort. These weren't happy times; nobody had much. The library's where I got into this mythology. But how the people came together was radio, or the funny papers. Sunday was a huge deal. You'd go racing for the funnies. Without knowing it, I was very connected to them.' Redford has directed a few films, starred in scores more. But if you had to guess it would be directing that has his heart. 'Originally,' he says, 'when I first got involved in Bagger Vance I thought of it as something I would be in. But quickly I decided against that because when I started to read the book it had too many parallels to The Natural . I've sort of been there. And I was more interested in a younger cast because it might be more affecting to have this happen to a very young person. It reminded me of A.E. Housman's poem 'A Shropshire Lad', an ode to an athlete who dies young. I remembered being moved by the fact that this guy goes out in a moment of glory, and maybe that was the best time to go out, 'cause after that it's all downhill...' Redford, the director ORDINARY PEOPLE (1980) Redford's directorial debut, a sombre drama about a grief-stricken family, won him an Oscar. It also marked him out as a major player behind the camera following a decade as one of Hollywood's biggest box-office draws. A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT (1992) Brad Pitt looked suspiciously like the young Redford in this tale of fraternal friendship and fly fishing set in picturesque Montana. Pitt played the small-town rebel destined for a tragic end. QUIZ SHOW (1994) An intelligent morality tale based on the infamous Fifties' US television quiz scandals. Ralph Fiennes played the handsome patrician who cheated his way to fame and fortune before falling from grace. THE HORSE WHISPERER (1998) An epic melodrama based on Nicholas Evans's bestseller. Redford starred as the laconic cowboy with healing hands who is hired to help a horse and its traumatised teenage owner.",

So instead we're going to work with the customers we've already got,' said Tom Hartley, marketing director with 9Feet.com, the outdoor wear e-tailer. </p> <p>It is a familiar lament up and down e-tail land. In the run-up to Christmas, scores of e-tailers are having to confront an ugly dilemma. With money running out and little enthusiasm from banks or venture capitalists to give them more, e-tailers are having to choose between a big, expensive marketing push, a final blitzkrieg designed to suck in large volumes of consumers, or a low-key affair that will at least ensure they have cash in the bank for next year. </p> <p>Hartley's company is selling around 100 items a day at an average price of \u00a350-\u00a370. In the run-up to Christmas, the company, which has halved its staff, is looking to double its sales. </p> <p>If it doesn't pull this off, 9Feet, like many other e-tailers, faces huge problems. 'If we have a reasonable Christmas and can satisfy enough consumers, we'll be around this time next year,' Hartley said. 'We've got enough cash to last a few more months.' </p> <p>'Christmas will be make or break time for many online businesses,' said Murray Hennessy, chief executive officer of Buy.com Europe, the e-tailer that specialises in selling computer equipment. The cake is huge. The Gartner Group is predicting that global online shopping in the run-up to Christmas will total nearly $20 billion this year. Considering the group is predicting that online e-tail sales will total $29bn for the whole of this year, the need to make a success of the Christmas period is paramount. </p> <p>Having seen a number of high-profile failures such as Boo and Boxman, many e-tailers are now following 9Feet's example and cutting back, on both staff and marketing, in an attempt to hit the profitability mark sooner. But this approach also brings problems. </p> <p>'We've heard time and again how dotcoms are reducing costs in order to become profitable. But what we've learned is that, rather than help the company, cost-cutting reduces sales growth so drastically that profitability becomes nearly impossible,' said Brian Mittman, vice-president of Getzler &amp; Co, a New York-based turnaround firm. </p> <p>Getzler's firm compared the performances of dotcom firms which pared back their spending with those that continued with their original strategies. The growth rate for those that cut costs was 19 per cent year on year. But those that continued to spend enjoyed a growth rate of nearly 150 per cent. </p> <p>The rewards for the e-tailers that make the right call are huge as more and more people gain the confidence to shop online. According to research firm eStats, 14 per cent of internet users bought something online in 1998. Two years on and this figure has risen to 45 per cent. </p> <p>To put this into a UK context, the number of people visiting internet retail sites in the UK has increased by 72 per cent since the start of this year, according to MMXI Europe. The number of unique visitors to retail sites has increased from around 2.4 million in January to nearly 4.5 million in September. </p> <p>But this explosion in the number of customers has brought new problems. The simple fact is that more e-tailers are now competing for custom. A report by research firm Jupiter suggested that there are now a staggering 1.4 million websites dedicated to e-commerce in the UK alone. </p> <p>The result: squeezed margins or faster burn rates as e-tailers look to spend their way out of trouble. </p> <p>Unfortunately the e-tailers don't have the deep pockets of their 'clicks and mortar' counterparts - those high street firms that have an online presence - and are suffering as a result. </p> <p>The e-tailers now find themselves having to cut their prices faster than the established re-tailers just to stay in the game. </p> <p>The Goldfish e-tail price index, issued last week, showed that pure e-tailers cut their prices by 2 per cent in September. In contrast the clicks and mortar firms reduced prices by 1.4 per cent over the same period. This means that the pure dotcom firms are now undercutting their established rivals by 4 per cent on average. </p> <p>Of course, this model works only if the e-tailers can sell in such huge volumes that they can afford to cut their prices. And it is clear that many online firms are now finding the move to get big fast - like Amazon - impossible. Some, like online cosmetics firm ClickMango, simply disappear; others sell themselves for a song to a high street firm looking for a bit of dotcom kudos. Electrical e-tailer Jungle went to GUS and online music firm AudioStreet is now majority- owned by Woolworths. </p> <p>'The market has shaken out a lot this year. The number of independent companies has greatly reduced. They've found out that you need big volumes and a big product range,' said David Windsor-Clive, a director of Boxman.com, the pan-European music e-tailer which ceased trading last month. </p> <p>But, in addition, it is vital that the e-tailers sort out their fulfilment systems - the boring old backroom stuff that ensures you can order easily and that what you order gets to you on time. </p> <p>During the previous two Christmases the sector was heavily criticised for failing to deliver on its promises. It cannot afford to get it wrong this time. </p> <p>'After two online holiday-buying seasons of lost orders, late deliveries and broken promises, consumers have little patience for late or lost orders and poor customer service,' said Geri Spieler, research director for Gartner's e-Business Services. </p> <p>But the sector is still failing to address this issue. A global study released last week by AT Kearney, the management consultancy, found that an astonishing 80 per cent of online purchases abort because consumers are bombarded with too many requests for information, are scared to enter credit card de-tails, or encounter problems with the website. </p> <p>The consultancy estimates that firms are missing out on an extra $6.1bn in sales as a result. </p> <p>In addition, the smaller e-tailers are having difficulties scaling up their businesses in response to increased demand before Christmas. 'A lot of dotcoms will run into problems with fulfilment. They're trying to meet demand but the end result is horror stories such as the MD driving the forklift or bringing in his family to package the products,' Hennessy said. </p> <p>The irony is that, despite these problems, online customers can be far more attractive to retailers than those who shop in the high street. 'Once you've taken the time to give details such as your address and your credit card numbers you will come back - if the company fulfils your order. Online shoppers are far more loyal than offline,' said Joe Dickinson, a partner at AT Kearney. But only a few dotcom retailers are going to benefit from this loyalty. Many e-tailers are just for Christmas, not for life.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Everyone knows buying Christmas presents is expensive. E-tailers are discovering how costly it is to sell them. 'We were going to be in FHM with a double-page spread but it would have cost us \u00a320,000. So instead we're going to work with the customers we've already got,' said Tom Hartley, marketing director with 9Feet.com, the outdoor wear e-tailer. It is a familiar lament up and down e-tail land. In the run-up to Christmas, scores of e-tailers are having to confront an ugly dilemma. With money running out and little enthusiasm from banks or venture capitalists to give them more, e-tailers are having to choose between a big, expensive marketing push, a final blitzkrieg designed to suck in large volumes of consumers, or a low-key affair that will at least ensure they have cash in the bank for next year. Hartley's company is selling around 100 items a day at an average price of \u00a350-\u00a370. In the run-up to Christmas, the company, which has halved its staff, is looking to double its sales. If it doesn't pull this off, 9Feet, like many other e-tailers, faces huge problems.

Both countries have had a turbulent brewing history: Prohibition stopped beer making in its tracks for more than a decade in the US, while war, revolution and state control closed many Chinese breweries and drove out the gweilos or foreigners who had built and run most of them.</p> <p>Now the gweilos are back and the likes of Anheuser-Busch - the brewer of American Budweiser - Beck's, Carlsberg, Foster's, Guinness, Heineken, Holsten, Miller, San Miguel, South African Breweries, Tennents from Scotland, and the Japanese giants Asahi, Kirin and Suntory are either building breweries or running existing ones in partnership with the locals. Rising living standards are leading to greater consumption and soon the 1,300 breweries in the US will pale into insignificance as China surges into the lead.</p> <p>Chinese breweries are so busy feeding the internal market that few of their products are exported. The only regular beer to appear in Britain is China's oldest and biggest brand, Tsingtao. The pale lager (4.2 per cent) was first brewed by Germans in 1903 in the town of the same name in Shantung province. The Tsingtao brewing company has around 20 plants throughout the country and has enjoyed considerable investment from Anheuser-Busch. Its main product has a malty aroma and more character than most beers in the Far East.</p> <p>Guinness is popular in China, where the colour black signifies quality. The Anglo-Irish giant brews a version of its ubiquitous Foreign Extra Stout there. For the Irish in Britain, along with other lovers of the 'dry Irish' style, ethnic beer shops often sell the African, Caribbean and Belgian versions of Foreign Extra Stout. All foreign versions of FES, as it's known, are based on the bottled Dublin original - a palpable link with porter and stout brewing in the late-18th century, when dark beers were a blend of young and mature or 'stale' brews.</p> <p>On sale in Britain, FES is highly complex at 7.5 per cent, with roasted barley giving colour and character to a beer that has a toasted, winey and woody aroma, a full bittersweet palate with great hop character, and a finish that becomes dry and hoppy with hints of bitter chocolate, licorice and sour fruit. Guinness is brewed under licence in the West Indies, where stouts are popular not only for their taste but also for their alleged ability to enhance sexual performance. Dragon Stout, brewed by Desnoes &amp; Geddes in Jamaica, promises 'to put it back', though at 7 per cent it's more likely to send drinkers to sleep. This sweetish, full-flavoured beer with a heavy, yellowish head, is available in Britain, as is the quenching Carib lager (5.2 per cent) from Trinidad. The biggest-selling beer from the region, Red Stripe from Jamaica, is brewed under licence here by Charles Wells of Bedford and doesn't count as a true ethnic beer. The same problem confronts India's two leading beers, Kingfisher and Cobra. Kingfisher has been brewed for years by Kent brewer Shepherd Neame. Cobra was imported until recently, but is now brewed here by the energetic Charles Wells.</p> <p>On the American mainland, Mexico is a brewing giant, best known in Britain for Corona and Sol lagers. The 4.6 per cent beers are often derided as 'cheapies', but this overlooks the fact that they are made with large amounts of rice as well as barley to cut costs and bring them within the reach of poor peasants. American tourists turned the beers into fad drinks sold at exorbitant prices. Both breweries produce dark lagers, Negro Modelo (5.3 per cent) and Dos Equis (4.8 per cent).</p> <p>France and Italy have both seen a rebirth of brewing. In France, the revival is due to the determination of people in the Flanders region to emphasise their traditions. The beer style known as bi\u00e8re de garde - 'keeping beer' - has enjoyed spectacular growth in recently, as any visitor to the bars of Lille can testify.</p> <p>The best-known brewer of bi\u00e8re de garde is Jenlain in a village of the same name, south of Valenciennes. In common with many brewers in the region, the brewery, run by the Duyck family, started life on a farm and produced strong ales for the family and farm labourers. It is represented in Britain by Jenlain Blonde (6 per cent) which bursts with rich malt and perfumy hop character.</p> <p>In Italy, beer drinking has been fuelled by a young generation anxious to distance itself from the wine-drinking habits of its parents. You will find not only British beers on sale in Italy, but English-style pubs as well. The mainstream lagers of Italy's biggest producers, Moretti and Peroni, are available in Britain and are pleasant if undemanding beers. Look out for Peroni's Gran Riserva (6.6 per cent), based on the strong Bavarian style known as Bock. Launched to mark 150 years of brewing, this flagship brand has a malty/nutty aroma with a good dash of Saaz hops in the rich, warming finish.</p> <p>\u0095 Most of the beers mentioned are available from The Beer Shop, 14 Pitfield Street, London N1 (020 7739 3701). Sol and Moretti are on sale at Oddbins. Peroni and Guinness FES are available from Tescos. Charles Wells can be contacted on 01234 272 766</p>",

      "body": "<p>Ours is a world which finds it hard to respect boundaries, where supermarkets sell pension plans, football clubs have their own credit cards and the Pope has a website (no doubt with a link to www.supremebeing.com). What price specialism in such an age? Most wine merchants are generalists these days, with lists that run the gamut from Australia to Uruguay (they draw the line, quite sensibly, at Yugoslavia and Zimbabwe). But there are a few companies out there who dare to be 'ethnic', who import all or most of their wines from a single country. These are my favourites. </p> <p> <strong> Australian Wine Club (020 8538 0718)</strong> </p> <p> An operation which promises 'a better class of insult', the customer-friendly AWC is the mail-order offspring of the original Australian Wine Centre beneath the Strand. Craig Smith, brilliantly assisted by office cat and human resources director Mr F Luff, imports wine from some of the best operations Down Under, including Torbreck, St Hallett, Chapel Hill, Tim Adams and Primo Estate. Smith, the self-styled founder of the 'Australian Pinot Noir: Why do they bother? Society' is mad about Rhne varieties, which makes this the place to come for a glass of Shiraz, Grenache or Mourv\u00e8dre. And the odd insult, of course. </p> <p> <strong> 1997 The Willows Vineyard Shiraz, Barossa Valley </strong> (\u00a39.99). <br>A dark, plummy, spicy, tobaccoey red with silky tannins and considerable elegance for a wine with 14.5 per cent alcohol. This wine will age for at least a decade. </p> <p> <strong> Fine Wines of New Zealand (020 7482 0093)</strong> </p> <p> Master of Wine Margaret Harvey was working as a hospital pharmacist when she decided to set up Fine Wines of New Zealand in 1985. Originally from Auckland, she reckoned New Zealand had 'the potential to make people sit up and think', long before anyone had heard of Cloudy Bay. She still goes home once a year to source new wines and 'keep abreast of what's hot'. The result is a small, but extremely well-chosen list from some of the country's best estates, including brilliant wines from Ata Rangi, Te Motu, Rippon, Stonyridge and Kumeu River. The most interesting Kiwi wine list in the country. </p> <p> <strong> 1998 Ata Rangi C\u00e9l\u00e8bre, Martinborough </strong> (\u00a314). <br>An intense, blackberry and cassis-like blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah from the stunning 1998 vintage. This is a wine that has real class, balance and length. </p> <p> <strong> Moreno Wines (020 7286 0678)</strong> </p> <p> Moreno Wines was originally set up by two refugees from the Spanish Civil War. Today, the company is run by their son, Manuel, who started life as a sociology lecturer before deciding that he preferred Rioja to Max Weber. A self-confessed 'regionalist eccentric', Moreno has assembled a brilliant Spanish (and South American) list with particular strengths in out-of-the-way areas and fine wines, especially in Rioja, Priorato and Ribera del Duero. A favourite with hispanophiles, Moreno Wines runs its own popular wine club, with tastings- cum-fiestas on a regular basis.

      "bodyText": "Ours is a world which finds it hard to respect boundaries, where supermarkets sell pension plans, football clubs have their own credit cards and the Pope has a website (no doubt with a link to www.supremebeing.com). What price specialism in such an age? Most wine merchants are generalists these days, with lists that run the gamut from Australia to Uruguay (they draw the line, quite sensibly, at Yugoslavia and Zimbabwe). But there are a few companies out there who dare to be 'ethnic', who import all or most of their wines from a single country. These are my favourites. Australian Wine Club (020 8538 0718) An operation which promises 'a better class of insult', the customer-friendly AWC is the mail-order offspring of the original Australian Wine Centre beneath the Strand. Craig Smith, brilliantly assisted by office cat and human resources director Mr F Luff, imports wine from some of the best operations Down Under, including Torbreck, St Hallett, Chapel Hill, Tim Adams and Primo Estate. Smith, the self-styled founder of the 'Australian Pinot Noir: Why do they bother? Society' is mad about Rhne varieties, which makes this the place to come for a glass of Shiraz, Grenache or Mourv\u00e8dre. And the odd insult, of course. 1997 The Willows Vineyard Shiraz, Barossa Valley (\u00a39.99). A dark, plummy, spicy, tobaccoey red with silky tannins and considerable elegance for a wine with 14.5 per cent alcohol. This wine will age for at least a decade. Fine Wines of New Zealand (020 7482 0093) Master of Wine Margaret Harvey was working as a hospital pharmacist when she decided to set up Fine Wines of New Zealand in 1985. Originally from Auckland, she reckoned New Zealand had 'the potential to make people sit up and think', long before anyone had heard of Cloudy Bay. She still goes home once a year to source new wines and 'keep abreast of what's hot'. The result is a small, but extremely well-chosen list from some of the country's best estates, including brilliant wines from Ata Rangi, Te Motu, Rippon, Stonyridge and Kumeu River. The most interesting Kiwi wine list in the country. 1998 Ata Rangi C\u00e9l\u00e8bre, Martinborough (\u00a314). An intense, blackberry and cassis-like blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Syrah from the stunning 1998 vintage. This is a wine that has real class, balance and length. Moreno Wines (020 7286 0678) Moreno Wines was originally set up by two refugees from the Spanish Civil War. Today, the company is run by their son, Manuel, who started life as a sociology lecturer before deciding that he preferred Rioja to Max Weber. A self-confessed 'regionalist eccentric', Moreno has assembled a brilliant Spanish (and South American) list with particular strengths in out-of-the-way areas and fine wines, especially in Rioja, Priorato and Ribera del Duero. A favourite with hispanophiles, Moreno Wines runs its own popular wine club, with tastings- cum-fiestas on a regular basis. The ideal place to order something to go with your tapas or leg of lamb. 1998 Guelbenzu Navarra (\u00a36.99). New wave Navarra at its best, this is a blend of Tempranillo, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, showing sweet oak and notes of raspberry, mulberry and nutmeg spice. The South African Wine Centre (020 7903 8311) Run by ex-pat South African Michael Shevelu, who is 'sole buyer and writes every page in the list', the South African Wine Centre has assembled the best selection of Cape wines this side of Earls Court. Shevelu describes the SAWC as a 'one-stop shop for all the best private winery and estate wines, with no identikit, mass-produced products', and it's hard to disagree with him. If you want to drink something from traditional wineries like Meerlust or Kanonkop, or from modernists such as Thelema, Grangehurst or Mulderbosch, this is the place to come. 1998 Clos Malverne, Pinotage Basket Pressed (\u00a37.49). From a winery with a reputation for producing stylish, modern Pinotages, this is a sweet, sensuous wine with flavours of liquorice, vanilla and summer pudding. The Vine Trail (0117 9211770) Nick Brooks was a reluctant chartered accountant who always wanted to follow his father into the wine trade.

      "body": "<p>This week alone, I have managed to consume Chinese dim sum, Japanese sushi (albeit from Marks &amp; Spencer), Italian-made mushroom tortelloni and a Vietnamese noodle salad. I drank French water, Italian and American wine and Belgian beer. And, of course, I cooked in metric. </p> <p>Before I am lynched by the little-Englanders, I should add that, except for some pink grapefruits, all the fruit and vegetables I munched, baked or juiced were grown within a few miles of home, as was some of the cheese, the chocolate and a heavenly, ozone-scented crab. Even so, the score goes something like England 2, the rest of the world 10. Which, I suspect, sums up most open-minded Brits' diets. </p> <p>Culinary kleptomaniacs we may be, but what about the treasure that gets left here by those who visit or settle. Those who found themselves living and cooking here have enriched our national diet more than we have theirs. We can only thank the Indians, Bangladeshis, Spanish and Turks who have set up shop here and brought their recipes with them for adding a bit of spice and sunshine to our warming but ultimately bland cold-weather food. </p> <p>As much as we like to think the world links us with roast beef and apple hat, the truth is more mundane. To the Indians, Americans and Europeans, the British are linked with nothing more strongly than the potato. Forget our fruit puddings and our stately roasts, gloss over our heritage of meat pies and top-notch tracklements: we are, in most people's eyes, a spud culture. We roast, mash, boil, bake, fry and steam our beloved potato, and to those who will have no truck with 'foreign muck', a meal is not a meal without a reassuring tattie on the side. </p> <p>With the exception of the Chinese, who seem not to have taken much of a shine to our Solanum tuberosum, almost every culture's cooks have left their culinary calling card: the humble spud. </p> <p>The Spanish, who set up their tapas bars - now often run by wide boys born much closer to home - put patatas bravas on our culinary map. On the rare occasion it is properly made, patatas bravas are crisp, light chips with a tomato sauce made interesting by chilli and vinegar. A more devilish version of our chips and tomato ketchup, this classic tap has become a bit of soak-up-the-beer special here. A shame, because it can be a true pepper and potato treat. The Spanish omelette, if made with love and understanding, can become a quivering, tender slice of tiny yellow potatoes and sweet onions rather than the familiar fridge-cold wedge of cold egg and spuds. </p> <p>The Turkish community who have opened up restaurants here will almost certainly offer us potato fritters as part of our mezzo. Cypriot chefs, too, will hopefully have brought with them their own mezzo recipe for potatoes antinaktes - new potatoes lightly smashed then fried in hot oil with red wine, coriander root and its lush green leaves. While neither of these ideas has become staple fare in British kitchens, they are secrets waiting to get out. </p> <p>Every Indian restaurant flier that falls through my letterbox pedals its sag or Bombay alto - spuds with spinach or spice - but Indian cooks have a formidable collection of potato recipes. Batata dada, the fritters flavoured with turmeric, coriander and chilli, have opened up British cooks to the possibilities of spicing their potatoes and potato cakes. The classic British recipe for roasting potatoes is unlikely to feature anything spicier than the knee-jerk 'salt and freshly ground black pepper', yet the Indian way of roasting potatoes with turmeric, chilli and cumin is a recipe that deserves to be better known. </p> <p>The most famous Indian potato import must be the samosa. In my experience, this is a recipe which does not travel. Peas, diced potato, ginger, coriander, mint and chillies wrapped in wafer-thin pastry sound like they could win anyone over, yet this triangular pasty is invariably more akin to eating cumin-flavoured cardboard. The Indians who brought the recipe here seem to have for- gotten the first rule of samosa eating - that of the straight-from-the pan crispness that makes the whole thing worth eating. </p> <p>Irish cooks have taught us a thing or two when dealing with our staple ingredient, the most famous of which is to make Colcannon, where mashed potato is given a bit of interest with chopped cabbage or kale, spring onions and plenty of pepper. </p> <p>Moroccan potato stews, French gratins, American hashes and Portuguese caldo verde are recipes that we are more likely to have met on our culinary pillages and make on occasion in our own kitchens. The rest we should see as gifts. Presents brought to us by those who set up their kitchens here and have shown us that there is more to a potato than peeling and boiling it. </p> <p><strong> Spiced roast potatoes with yogurt and mint </strong><br> </p> <p>When Indians bake potatoes, they tend to add spices and some liquid such as water or yogurt, but I see no reason why you cannot add the yogurt afterwards, which allows the potatoes to crisp nicely. A moderate heat is needed to stop the spices from burning in the oven. Serves 4 as a side dish. </p> <p>4 medium-sized potatoes </p> <p>vegetable or groundnut oil </p> <p>2 fresh red chillies, as hot as you like </p> <p>2 cloves of garlic, peeled and crushed </p> <p>tsp cumin seeds </p> <p>tsp ground turmeric </p> <p><strong> to finish</strong><br> </p> <p> 4 tbsp natural yogurt </p> <p>a little ground, mild chill </p> <p>a palmful of young mint leaves </p> <p>Peel the potatoes, cut them into the sort of pieces you would for normal roasting, then bring them to the boil in deep water. Add salt to the pot and simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, until the potatoes are approaching tenderness. You should be able to slide a knifepoint through them with almost no pressure. Drain them thoroughly, then very gently shake the potatoes in their pan, so the edges fluff and 'bruise'. Set the oven at 180 C/gas mark 4. </p> <p>Heat enough oil to make a thin film in the bottom of a roasting tin. The thicker the base, the less likelihood there is of the spices burning. As the oil warms, add the chopped chillies, garlic and cumin and let the m warm through, stirring (and watching like a hawk) so they do not burn. Add the potatoes to the hot oil, add the turmeric, then slowly stir and toss the potatoes so they are covered with the seasoned oil. </p> <p>Roast the potatoes in the preheated oven until they have started to crisp (30 to 35minutes or so). You don't want them to be as brown as classic roast potatoes. They should be golden and flecked with spice. As the potatoes come from the oven, grind over a seasoning of salt, then spoon over the yogurt and sprinkle with a very little mild ground chilli and scatter with the chopped mint leaves. </p> <p><strong> Patatas bravas</strong><br> </p> <p>You could use a home made tomato sauce or, if you prefer, a ready-made one from the supermarket chiller cabinet. The bottled stuff tends to have too much tomato pur\u00e9e in it. Traditionally this is served as tapas - here, it is what I call a Monday evening dish. Just the job for brightening up Sunday's leftovers. Serves 4 as a side dish. </p> <p>3 large to medium potatoes </p> <p>olive oil </p> <p>250ml tomato sauce </p> <p>2 tbsp white-wine vinegar (to taste) </p> <p>several shakes of Tabasco sauce </p> <p>Peel the potatoes, then cut them into thick chips or, as I have eaten them in Bilbao, small cubes. Pour 2 or 3 tbsp olive oil into a large frying pan and cook the potatoes in it till they are lightly coloured. This will take less time if you take the cube route. </p> <p>Meanwhile, heat 1 tbsp of the oil in a deeper pan, add the tomato sauce, vinegar and Tabasco - check for seasoning, adding salt, pepper and more vinegar or chilli sauce as you think fit. </p> <p>Pour a little of the sauce into the pan with the potatoes and toss gently to cover with the sauce. To be at their best, the potatoes need only a little tomato sauce - the rest can be served in a dish for those who want more. </p> <p><strong> Colcannon</strong><br> </p> <p>An Irish way. Enough for 4 as side dish. </p> <p>500g large potatoes </p> <p>half a small January King cabbage </p> <p>a little hot milk for mashing the potatoes </p> <p>50g butter </p> <p>Peel the potatoes and boil in salted water. When they are tender, drain them and mash them with the butter and enough hot milk to make a creamy mash, stiff enough to stand in peaks. </p> <p>While the potatoes are boiling, wash, shred and boil the cabbage. Drain, then season with pepper and salt. When the potatoes are ready, fold the cabbage into the mashed potatoes, pile into a warm bowl, and - this is important - serve with a lump of melting butter in the middle.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A couple of years ago, I published a novel about the rise and fall of a great Anglo-Jewish restaurant and hotel business. As trade flourishes, the two partners find themselves craving acceptance beyond the confines of the Jewish community from which they sprang, and so they rewrite their menus. Accordingly, chicken soup becomes consomm\u00e9 de poulet. Because, of course, putting it in French makes it glamorous and refined, and if it's glamorous and refined it ain't too Jewish. </p> <p>Here's the thing: it was a joke. Not the best joke in the world, perhaps, but a joke all the same. And yet, just a couple of years later, I am sitting in Six-13, Britain's 'first-ever kosher-fusion restaurant' - like we needed one - and there, listed among the starters, is chicken consomm\u00e9. Apparently it's the same as chicken soup, only it costs \u00a35 a bowl. Next time I attempt to make jokes about the pretensions of Anglo-Jewry, I'll have to aim a little lower. </p> <p>Before the arrival of Six-13 (named after the 613 commandments the observant Jew must follow), if you had asked me to define kosher-fusion I'd have said it's what would happen if Vanessa Feltz and Jerry Seinfeld ever ended up in bed together. As far as the management is concerned, however, it simply means that religious Anglo-Jewry - the ones who keep kosher - should not be locked away in some mittel-European culinary ghetto of salt beef and lockshen pudding while the rest of the nation pleasures itself at the global larder. They, too, should have the right to eat crispy ginger and coriander pesto. Except, of course, if they happen to like salt beef and lockshen pudding because, significantly, both are on the menu here. </p> <p>Regardless of the grand claims that Six-13 makes for its concept, its core audience seems to like it. The roads leading from Hendon to the sleek, modern premises on London's Wigmore Street must have been bumper to bumper with Volvos on the week night we visited. It was packed. I hadn't seen this many Jews in one place in London since my Bar Mitzvah. </p> <p>As for the food, given the constraints it must work to, there's not much to kibitz* about - which is a shame, because it's what Jews do best in restaurants. As well as the obvious things such as no pork or shellfish, the most striking limitation on a kosher restaurant is that milk and meat must never be mixed. Those kosher restaurants that do use dairy products will serve only fish; Six-13 goes the other way, serving meat but no dairy. We went with Jonny, who keeps kosher, and his wife Sarah. Jonny took one look at the menu and said, 'Almost no one will be ordering the fish here. Fish they can eat at home. They'll all be eating the beef.' He was right. Platefuls of red meat were piling out of the kitchen as quickly as the waiters could schlep** them. </p> <p>For my starter, I tried to order the pan-fried foie gras, but the waiter told me it was off. Actually, he said, it hadn't yet come on. The Beth Din, the rabbinical court that passes foodstuffs as kosher, had thrown a broigus*** and refused to approve their supplier of liver. He gave a big 'what can you do' shrug. Instead I went for the seared tuna with pickled vegetables, at \u00a37.50. The fish had barely been on nodding terms with the heat and was, to all intents and purposes, a great, purple chunk of sashimi. That was fine by me. It was fresh and the pickled ginger on the side suitably sharp. Pat's grilled proven\u00e7al vegetables with salsa verde (\u00a35.50) was well executed. But the chicken soup - sorry, consomm\u00e9 - got the thumbs down from Jonny and Sarah: it was, they said, a rather polite affair. You could barely tell a chicken had died for it. In short, nothing like any of our mothers could make. </p> <p>For our main courses we all had the meat. Here, as we had begun to suspect it would be, the fusion thing was suddenly forgotten. There is nothing controversial about steak and chips, or roast rack of lamb, or roast duck breast with pickled red cabbage. But they were all fine cuts of meat, despite the kosher law requiring flesh to be drained of blood before cooking. At an average of \u00a318 a shot for each, though, they were damned expensive. </p> <p>It was in the puddings that the absence of dairy really showed itself. My pavlova was crying out to be smothered in cream, Jonny's tarte tatin came with a scoop of very strange-tasting ice cream, and Pat's coconut rice pudding, clearly made with coconut milk, was simply odd. But that was OK, because finally we got to kibitz about them and that made us very happy. </p> <p>Six-13 is rather less than it claims to be. It's a modern and expensive take on the kosher restaurant which proclaims innovation and yet does absolutely nothing that might frighten its target audience. And its target audience seems to love it. </p> <p>*kibitz - like complaining, but with much more shrugging. <br>**schlep - carrying things around while kibitzing about it. <br>***broigus - an angry outburst, often occasioned by being asked to do too much schlepping.</p> <p>\u0095 Six-13, 19 Wigmore Street, London W1 (020 7629 6133).

Had it been shot in black and white by Path\u00e9 it could not have looked more like a relic from an earlier age.</p> <p>There were the Socialist Workers' Party placards. There were the fluttering union banners and the votes of support from striking health workers from distant corners of the nation. And there, too, were the rousers of the rabble with their rhythmic call-and-response chants by megaphone and their insistence that the solution was to 'Tax the rich. Make them pay'.</p> <p>This is the borough described by one resident as 'Britain's North Korea. It's the place modern politics forgot'. The protesters' chants at least had the virtue of simplifying the situation down to a failure of leftist will by local councillors. But it is not that straightforward, however much you might wish it to be so. True, the crisis is down to a failure on the part of councillors but, as with everything in this deprived corner of East London, there are lots of other people more than deserving of blame.</p> <p>Last month the Borough Treasurer, George Jenkins, announced that Hackney did not have enough money to meet the commitments it had made up to the end of this financial year. In short, like New York in the Seventies, it was going bust. Under the terms of local government legislation Jenkins was forced to issue a Section 114 order, which immediately barred the council from spending any money until it had agreed budget cuts, which means finding savings of around \u00a34.5 million this year and \u00a318m next.</p> <p>Coming in the same week as Chancellor Gordon Brown was opening up his bulging exchequer to buy off pensioners and fuel protesters, the proposed cuts made Hackney look like the council that New Labour had left behind.</p> <p>The effect of the 114 order was almost immediate. Headteachers across the borough passed a vote of no confidence in their education service - already part-privatised due to previous failures - and wrote to parents informing them that, because they would not be able to employ supply teachers, their children might not have classes to go to. Parks and gardening trucks ran out of fuel and were told not to fill up. Council work men were given orders to do the minimum work possible.</p> <p>In one instance, a council tenant had a new bath fitted but was told he couldn't have any taps because that would mean extra expense. Another was told they could fix the stopcock in his toilet cistern but not the leaking pipe to it, leaving him unable to flush.</p> <p>Wetherell Day Nursery closed because of a leaking roof nobody could afford to fix. Then a manager in the council's waste service dismissed all the temporary staff, and rubbish collections, always erratic, stopped. This weekend the streets overflow with rotting garbage. The rats, at least, are getting fatter.</p> <p>It was supposed to be so different. In June, Hackney gained a new managing director, Max Caller, former chief executive of Barnet council, who answered an advert looking for somebody willing to take on 'the job from hell'. It was by no means underselling the challenge: there had been damning Ofsted reports on Hackney schools and part of the social services department had already come under direct central government control.</p> <p>The month Caller started work, proclaiming a commitment to give the people of Hackney 'a better deal and a joined-up council doing the right things for them', the District Auditor issued a report that uncovered widespread mismanagement and inadequate accounting on a vast scale. Last week, just as the council was meeting to discuss the latest cuts, there was yet another damning report, this time by the new Best Value Inspection Service set up under recent local government legislation.</p> <p>'Hackney is not a well-run council and is letting down the people who live in the borough,' said Wendy Thomson, director of inspection at the Audit Commission. 'It is simply not delivering best value in council tax collection, payment of housing benefit, refuse collection, street sweeping or children's services.' No fewer than 17,000 people, she said, were awaiting payment of housing benefit.</p> <p>At the same time, Caller issued his own report, stuffed full of staggering allegations. Almost nothing at all, he said, was known about who was spending what. Local managers would hide the true costs of their services or would tell democratically elected members what they thought they wanted to hear instead of the truth. As a result, a \u00a35m contract with a private company for rubbish collection had to be delayed when it emerged that the cost of running the service was double that. Managers were also ignoring orders.</p> <p>When the council passed a resolution insisting no more permanent staff be employed, managers simply employed temporary ones, who turned out to cost more. It was clear, Caller announced, 'that the various moratoriums that were imposed were either not understood, ignored or subverted'.</p> <p>Ask the political classes of Hackney how it got to be this way and they will sigh and tell you it is a very long story. Partly, they will say, it is simple economics. The borough has few pockets of wealth and receives the fourth-highest central government grant in the country - \u00a31,220 per head of population. There are deep, dark pools of unemployment and poverty and areas where crime and drug abuse are rife.</p> <p>It was not always like this. Though there has long been poverty here, it was once a thriving borough with big department stores on the high streets and fine Georgian and Regency Squares now left isolated in the midst of dilapidated council estates.</p> <p>Throughout its history, those with money who have soaked up its rich diverse culture have eventually moved out. (In the Eighties, for example, a young married couple with promising careers as barristers lived in the Mapledene area of Hackney. In time they, too, decided to move to up-and-coming Islington and never looked back. Their names were Tony and Cherie Blair.)</p> <p>But economic deprivation does not explain all or, at least, not the most recent problems. 'There's simply been a failure of political culture in Hackney,' says Jules Pipe of the Labour Group who, with his Tory colleague Eric Ollerenshaw, now leads the council. He points at a split in Labour in 1996, when more than a dozen Labour members left the party. 'You will never get to the bottom of that split. It was just two groups of people who mutually hated each other. But the moment it became a hung council the idea of an administration with a scrutinising opposition went out the window. In short, there was an absence of administration.'</p> <p>Councillors busied themselves with feverish infighting to such a degree that the then chief executive, Tony Eliston, said he would install traffic lights in the council chamber to control floor-crossing by members. (One councillor, David Phillips, has sat as Labour, Hackney New Labour - nothing to do with the Blair-Mandelson version - Conservative, Independent, LibDem and now Green Party.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, without any scrutiny by councillors to trouble them, unelected managers set about creating fiefdoms within the council.</p> <p>In 1997 a new plan, 'Transforming Hackney', placed budgets in the hands of individual managers in an attempt to get council services closer to residents. Without any central financial management at all, Hackney council was at the mercy of legions of incompetent council officials.</p> <p>The question Hackney residents are now asking themselves is whether the severe cuts announced last week - up to 500 jobs may go, employees are being given new working terms and conditions, council trading units are being closed down, services are being withdrawn - are merely a symptom of the chronic disease or the cure.</p> <p>Pipe is in no doubt they are curing their ills. Labour and the Conservatives have decided to co-operate - shoving the Lib Dems into opposition - and so there is now a form of political stability for the first time in four years. 'Under Max Caller and his new team we also have management in place which has finally been able to identify the problems,' he says.</p> <p>Caller agrees. 'We have been able to take the decision that needed to be taken. We have introduced management controls which make it possible to handle the finances. I am determined to get best value for the people of Hackney.' Budget cuts, he says, are not necessarily the same as cuts in services. 'We simply need to improve efficiency and productivity.' How that will be done, he does not say.</p> <p>Whether the cuts agreed last Monday night will achieve all of this is open to question. Several are in complete contradiction to central government policy. For example, next year Hackney will cut more than \u00a3600,000 from its budget for early education at the same time as the Government is shoving it to the top of its agenda.</p> <p>Likewise, the borough has cut 48 beds from its residential care services for people coming out of hospital and slashed away at the budget for home care. The most likely outcome is that, because there will be nowhere to discharge them to, patients will lock up hospital beds, thus lengthening waiting lists.</p> <p>Even Caller admitted, in his report to the council, that this will have 'immediate repercussions on health, particularly through the winter period'. Likewise he admitted the changes he was proposing to the social services would mean cutting back on preventative work, even though it is a statutory requirement of all councils.</p> <p>Despite all of this, Whitehall will not be intervening to bail out Hackney.</p> <p>'I'm horrified by the position there,' said Local Government Minister Hillary Armstrong. 'It's a position no council should have got itself into. It's a position no residents should have to experience. But throwing money at the problem is not the solution. They have to get their own house in order.'</p> <p>So is she abandoning Hackney? 'Far from it. We will back them all the way. We just have to hope that they've got to the bottom of the deficit and that nobody's hiding any more debt.'</p> <p>Perhaps most worrying for the people of Hackney is that, technically, the borough is still bust. Despite the cuts, the budget is in no way balanced and it is only because of loan facilities agreed with central government late on Friday that the council can continue to spend money at all.</p> <p>Should there be any problems at all with these loans and the budget falls short, the Borough Treasurer will be forced to issue another Section 114 order. All spending will cease immediately.</p> <p>Toilets will remain unfixed. Roofs will leak. Rubbish will go uncollected. For the long-suffering people of Hackney, it will be business as usual.</p>",

It was just two groups of people who mutually hated each other. But the moment it became a hung council the idea of an administration with a scrutinising opposition went out the window. In short, there was an absence of administration.' Councillors busied themselves with feverish infighting to such a degree that the then chief executive, Tony Eliston, said he would install traffic lights in the council chamber to control floor-crossing by members. (One councillor, David Phillips, has sat as Labour, Hackney New Labour - nothing to do with the Blair-Mandelson version - Conservative, Independent, LibDem and now Green Party.) Meanwhile, without any scrutiny by councillors to trouble them, unelected managers set about creating fiefdoms within the council. In 1997 a new plan, 'Transforming Hackney', placed budgets in the hands of individual managers in an attempt to get council services closer to residents. Without any central financial management at all, Hackney council was at the mercy of legions of incompetent council officials. The question Hackney residents are now asking themselves is whether the severe cuts announced last week - up to 500 jobs may go, employees are being given new working terms and conditions, council trading units are being closed down, services are being withdrawn - are merely a symptom of the chronic disease or the cure. Pipe is in no doubt they are curing their ills. Labour and the Conservatives have decided to co-operate - shoving the Lib Dems into opposition - and so there is now a form of political stability for the first time in four years. 'Under Max Caller and his new team we also have management in place which has finally been able to identify the problems,' he says. Caller agrees. 'We have been able to take the decision that needed to be taken. We have introduced management controls which make it possible to handle the finances. I am determined to get best value for the people of Hackney.' Budget cuts, he says, are not necessarily the same as cuts in services. 'We simply need to improve efficiency and productivity.' How that will be done, he does not say. Whether the cuts agreed last Monday night will achieve all of this is open to question. Several are in complete contradiction to central government policy. For example, next year Hackney will cut more than \u00a3600,000 from its budget for early education at the same time as the Government is shoving it to the top of its agenda. Likewise, the borough has cut 48 beds from its residential care services for people coming out of hospital and slashed away at the budget for home care. The most likely outcome is that, because there will be nowhere to discharge them to, patients will lock up hospital beds, thus lengthening waiting lists. Even Caller admitted, in his report to the council, that this will have 'immediate repercussions on health, particularly through the winter period'. Likewise he admitted the changes he was proposing to the social services would mean cutting back on preventative work, even though it is a statutory requirement of all councils. Despite all of this, Whitehall will not be intervening to bail out Hackney. 'I'm horrified by the position there,' said Local Government Minister Hillary Armstrong. 'It's a position no council should have got itself into. It's a position no residents should have to experience. But throwing money at the problem is not the solution. They have to get their own house in order.' So is she abandoning Hackney? 'Far from it. We will back them all the way. We just have to hope that they've got to the bottom of the deficit and that nobody's hiding any more debt.' Perhaps most worrying for the people of Hackney is that, technically, the borough is still bust. Despite the cuts, the budget is in no way balanced and it is only because of loan facilities agreed with central government late on Friday that the council can continue to spend money at all. Should there be any problems at all with these loans and the budget falls short, the Borough Treasurer will be forced to issue another Section 114 order. All spending will cease immediately. Toilets will remain unfixed. Roofs will leak. Rubbish will go uncollected. For the long-suffering people of Hackney, it will be business as usual.",

      "body": "<p>Well, it's certainly turned out to be an exhausting year. My worries that I'd find myself at a very loose end having given up my regular arts show on television proved unfounded. Instead, I've been incredibly busy, devoting myself to the dumbing down of two great British institutions: the Booker Prize and the BBC's Panorama . </p> <p> <strong> March</strong> </p> <p> It was early March when I got a call from a publisher friend warning me that I'd be receiving a letter from the Booker Prize committee asking me to join this year's judging panel. Obviously, I laughed down the line and demanded to know what medication he was on. A further five minutes of conversation convinced me that this was not a joke at my expense. </p> <p>It was an exciting moment, I must admit, and marked a personal triumph after years of having my hair colour dictate the sort of work I was offered. It was also the beginning of an at times torturous eight months during which I was to read 120 novels in my spare time. </p> <p>My first encounter with this year's chairman, the charming and - as I was to discover - inspirationally diplomatic Simon Jenkins proved less intimidating than I'd imagined. Simon and I dined in a small Greek restaurant in Regent's Park and discovered we had much in common, including favourite books. In fact, so convivial was lunch that I left besotted. Lunch with the Booker's administrator, Martin Goff, was a more glamorous affair in the Meridian Piccadilly but proved equally enjoyable and both left me feeling confident that I was capable of rising to the task ahead. </p> <p>It was lucky that they were so encouraging, because while I set about cancelling all social engagements until November and organising to spend as much time as possible buried in books down in Sussex, the papers had a field day. First, Jerry Hall is brought in to judge the Whitbread, they thundered, and then Mariella Frostrup is asked to sit on the Booker jury. Armageddon must surely be just around the corner. Pencil sharpeners were working overtime. The furore was as outdated and misogynistic as it was hilarious. </p> <p>What on earth was the world coming to? I mean, Jerry Hall and I were women who were seen out and about at 'parties', had probably never worn a tweed skirt in our lives and might possibly be interested in 'popular music' and fashion. What on earth could we possibly know and understand about literature? </p> <p> <strong> May</strong> </p> <p> The books started arriving weekly in boxes of 10 and by early summer I was floundering in a murky pool of despair. First of all, there were none of my favourite authors like Jackie Collins and Jilly Cooper. But frankly neither would have been much worse than some of the initial entries and I took to phoning Simon Jenkins on a daily basis to express my fears that we were never going to find one good book, let alone a shortlist of six. He dealt with my panicky whingeing with a mixture of fatherly reassurance and practical good sense. 'Better books will come' became his catchphrase and luckily they did. </p> <p> <strong> June</strong> </p> <p> I was away for the social meeting set up for the judges so my initial encounter with the rest of the panel was at the first in a series of whittling-down sessions suggested by Simon. I arrived filled with trepidation at his Albany apartment, having spent all morning trying to decide what a 'Booker judge' should wear. I reluctantly put my ra-ra skirt and sequinned bodice aside until after 7 November and set out, neutrally dressed, stomach churning. </p> <p>Putting a defiant face on for the media was all very well, but for these members of the intelligentsia I was surely going to be a bite-sized snack. My fears couldn't have been less justified. The rest of the panel - Caroline Gascoigne, Rose Tremain, and Roy Foster - were delightful and we spent a fascinating lunchtime tiptoeing through each other's literary likes and dislikes. Indeed, during the first months we tended to concur on the same books and I frequently wondered how so many Booker years had ended in catfights. </p> <p> <strong> July</strong> </p> <p> The reading may have been going well but it was playing havoc with my private life. Reading has become such an obscure hobby that declining invitations because you've got to 'finish a book' appears the least convincing of excuses. I heard rumours of friends saying I'd obviously fallen out with them, my phone gradually stopped ringing and by July only my nearest and dearest were prepared to brave the ranting hysteric they invariably found on the end of the receiver. 'I can't talk now I've got 12 books left from the last shipment and another box has just arrived,' I'd screech before slamming down the phone. Eventually, they, too, decided to leave me to my own devices. </p> <p> <strong> August</strong> </p> <p> The request to front the Edinburgh Festival shows on BBC2 throughout August came as a relief. Unlike the thousands of others who descend on the Scottish capital for its annual celebration of arts and comedy, I find relocating to Edinburgh a wonderful opportunity to cut myself off from the world. In a lovely flat in the city centre, I took up daily yoga classes, visited the shows I was reviewing for the programme and hunkered down for some serious reading. By the end of August, I was enjoying a period of relative calm and feeling that finally I was actually ahead of the game. I'd finished about two-thirds of the books I had to read and had taken September and October off to complete the task. </p> <p> <strong> Early September</strong> </p> <p> Then came the second offer of this millennium year that I just couldn't turn down. A request from Panorama , following the publication of a diary I'd written on the subject in the Spectator , to front a show on the phenomenon of reality TV as evidenced by the nation's mass addiction to Channel 4's Big Brother . Knowing that yet again I was laying my neck on the chopping block, I had my hair cut shorter in preparation and did what anyone would have done in my position - said yes. </p> <p>The press was once again outraged, or at least the Daily Mail was. I was quivering with nerves by the time I arrived for my first meeting in the Panorama offices. Not only had the new controller of BBC1 been quoted in the Mail as viewing my appointment as 'a joke' but a mysterious Panorama 'insider' was said to be 'horrified' at my appointment. It seemed I embodied the rot at the heart of public service broadcasting. </p> <p>When I slunk in to meet the acting editor Clive Edwards and the team I would be working with, I tried to distinguish my enemy's face from a sea of welcoming ones. Despite my emerging investigative talents, I failed to locate Deep Throat. I presumed he was off in some war zone doing his manly thing. Instead, I met with my producer Toby Sculthorp and assistant producer Judith Ahern who informed me that they would expect me to work like any other reporter, ie coming into the office, writing the script, doing my own research. Surely some mistake. We all know that TV presenters are the living embodiment of ventriloquists' dummies. We're not supposed necessarily even to understand what we're given to read on autocue, let alone write it, unless of course we read the news. </p> <p>After the meeting, Toby offered to walk me around the offices and I must say I was relieved. The dumbing-down process seemed already to be in full swing. The walls were covered with pictures of Brad Pitt, there were Beatles screensavers in evidence and even a comic strip attached to the noticeboard. In the distance, I could hear a football discussion getting very heated. This was going to be a lot easier than I'd imagined. A collection of serious news-hounds who actually knew what was going on in the world of popular culture: unthinkable. </p> <p> <strong> Late September</strong> </p> <p> Florida was the first spot we were to hit in our pursuit of the makers and victims of 'reality TV'. It was clear we'd landed in real America. Anything edible came in a bun, the beer was weak and tasteless and shopping malls spread like a virulent fungus across the towns. This was the world of obesity, anorexia and dysfunction that provides the human fodder for the US's endless steam of 'reality entertainment' shows. The 'entertaining' element proved hard to uncover while interviewing the drug addicts and tragic freaks from whom Jerry Springer and his ilk make their millions. </p> <p> <strong> Early October</strong> </p> <p> Back in London, I tried desperately to hide my suntan from Panorama colleagues working undercover and risking their lives in Northern Ireland. As I headed out to interview Nasty Nick, the most 'evil' man in Britain, whose life was apparently in danger as a result of his Big Brother antics, the reporter on the adjoining desk was receiving death threats from the Real IRA. Nobody was offering to take messages. I felt vindicated in my suspicion that the national addiction to 'reality TV' had got dangerously got out of hand. The most 'evil' man in Britain? Who says serious journalism is under threat? </p> <p>The Booker judging process was racing toward its first hurdle; the shortlist nominations. My dumbing-down was going so well that we had actually started to tell jokes at judging meetings. While we all agreed on four of the books on the shortlist, we were totally divided on Matthew Kneale's English Passengers and Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin . I pleaded Kneale's cause as passionately as I could. In the end, Simon's skilful arbitration resulted in both books making it on to the list and all of us claiming victory. I wondered if those would be the self-same books that would cause the greatest dissent when we reconvened to select a winner. </p> <p> <strong> Late October</strong> </p> <p> Still the jibes continued to flow about my 'dumbing-down' crusade. At Nigella Lawson's book launch, a female journalist stuck a tape-recorder into my face and said: 'I suppose you're off to the West Bank next?' 'No, the Left Bank's more my scene,' I retorted before being made part of a paparazzi sandwich with Nicola Formby and Penny Smith. They just love those blonde shots. I'd wanted to say South Bank but I didn't want to make Lord Bragg nervous. </p> <p>On Panorama , things were getting a little fraught. We'd interviewed a very disgruntled participant from BBC1's Castaway and it seemed the corridors of TV Centre were awash with angry controllers. We were supposed to be wagging the finger at commercial television, not going for our own jugular. Faced with the gathering storm Judith and I were happy to escape and head for Chicago where we'd managed to obtain an interview with the king of tabloid TV, Jerry Springer. </p> <p> Jerry's producer, Richard, informed me during a preparatory chat that, given the opportunity, he'd leap at being able to include on-screen executions in the show. Still reeling from that encounter, I listened while a slightly sweaty Jerry insisted that his programme was 'pure entertainment' and then popped into the studio to make a show about an incestuous father and daughter. What a laugh, eh? I couldn't wait to get out of the NBC studios and back on the plane. I just wished I'd been able to shower off the residual slime from my encounter en route to the airport. </p> <p> <strong> November</strong> </p> <p> Tuesday the 7th. The Booker judging has reached its conclusion. The five of us, along with Martin Goff, sat closeted in an intimidating mayoral room in London's Guildhall with just three hours to the announcement. As my favourites fell like skittles before Atwood's Blind Assassin my heart sank. I was disappointed that with such an unusual shortlist we were going to end up with a regular Booker name stealing the prize. Also, I'd grown incredibly attached to my two personal favourites - English Passengers and The Keepers of Truth by Michael Collins. </p> <p>Nevertheless, democracy rules and taking comfort in the fact that we'd already decided to look on the shortlist as our Booker winners I reluctantly went with the otherwise unanimous vote. We toasted the conclusion of our endeavours and then Caroline, Rose and I set off for a tiny room on the fourth floor to change into our finery. The good news for me was that we spent 30 minutes discussing make-up, our outfits and the benefits of a touch of hairspray. I'd triumphed at last and brought Rose and Caroline down to my level. All that reading had been worthwhile. </p> <p>Now, as the week draws to a close, there's only Panorama left to worry about. Have I succeeded in dumbing it down? Well, I did catch two researchers reading the tabloids yesterday afternoon. As a final test, I've left a couple of copies of Hello! and OK! magazine hidden in the office between the broadsheets. If I find them well thumbed when I rise early today - my thirty-eighth birthday - to put the finishing touches to tonight's show, my mission will be complete. </p> <p>\u0095 Panorama is on BBC1 at 10.15 tonight.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There's a saying about Jeff Randall. He's the guy who wakes up in the morning, wonders what dream job he's going to next and promptly lands it. But the BBC? Has Sunday Business's editor gone barking mad? He loathes woolly liberals, loves free markets, hates the BBC's business-bashers and hardly craves a gong for services to public broadcasting. </p> <p>Yet last Monday, Randall took the plunge: from March he will become the BBC's first-ever business editor, with a seat at the news and current affairs top table and a six-figure salary to match. </p> <p>'I've been a Sunday journalist now for 15 years,' Randall says. 'We all like a new challenge. If I can get the BBC to treat business more seriously, it will be a job well done. I'll have made my contribution.' </p> <p>The prospect already had the suits fretting long before Randall, sipping a quiet beer on Spain's Costa Blanca 10 days ago, decided to take up new director-general Greg Dyke's offer after six months of talking. How would the stuffy Corporation cope with the outspoken, 46-year-old Essex market trader's son, who'd debunked them all as 'patronising, middle class, guilt-ridden, do-gooders' in an excoriating editorial six months ago? </p> <p>What the BBC bureaucrats had barely reckoned with, however, was Dyke's own personal indictment of the BBC's business coverage - and that of the rest of British television - which he delivered to the Confederation of British Industry's annual conference last week. </p> <p>'Last month, on a busy day, on what was then the Nine O'clock News, we did something unusual: we produced an informative piece on what was happening at British Telecom,' Dyke told Britain's business elite. 'Editors of our general news and current affairs programmes will have to find space to make sure we improve further_ Up to now we thought it was good enough to have the economics editor also being responsible for business coverage on the side. It was wrong.' </p> <p>Charged with finding the real stories and boardroom personalities behind the glib headlines, Randall will split economics editor Peter Jay's empire at Television Centre. But Jay, the UK's former ambassador to the US and one-time bag carrier for Robert Maxwell, is not long for the BBC. 'Barely disguised contempt' is how insiders sum up Dyke's attitude to his economics pontificator-in-chief. The antipathy dates back to 1983, when Dyke rescued TV-am from its founding intellectuals, led by Jay, with a little help from his furry friend Roland Rat. After a decade with the Corporation, 63-year-old Jay's contract will not be renewed when it ends next year. </p> <p>Randall's appointment means three of the BBC's five specialist editors now have a definite print background. Andrew Marr, brought in as political editor to shunt out the affable Robin Oakley, edited the Independent, and Niall Dixon, social affairs editor, ran the Nursing Times . </p> <p>Auntie's public broadcasting types may sniff, but the print bias is hardly shocking. Dyke, who made his reputation and his millions in TV, is a former tabloid journalist. Also, TV news often feeds off newspapers' exclusives - nowhere more so than in business. The BBC's new economics and business unit, brought under one roof last year, employs 100 journalists, yet insiders are hard-pushed to recall a single big scoop. </p> <p>'When you look at the firepower we have, a lot of our output is purely on-diary,' one critical BBC insider said. 'The business world is as much about exclusives as any other. Jeff lives and breathes scoops. ITV is even worse, and we really must do better.' </p> <p>A devourer of 24-hour business channels such as CNBC and Bloomberg News, Dyke is already putting licence-payers' money where his mouth is. Last month, the BBC's 30-year-old business flagship, The Money Programme , switched from a formulaic, presenter-led magazine on a Sunday night to a single-issue format broadcast in midweek. In December, BBC2's Working Lunch, will trial a 60-minute midday slot, against half-an-hour now. BBC Online , fighting umpteen internet news rivals, is about to double its business staff. </p> <p>Next autumn, the Beeb launches its new BBC3 and BBC4 digital TV channels. 'BBC4 will be current affairs, arts and definitely a daily business programme - a sort of Radio 4 agenda for TV,' one BBC executive said. 'BBC3's 18-35 audience will also have youngsters aspiring to be internet zillionaires. But the real battleground is getting more into the Rolls-Royce: the bulletins on BBC1.' </p> <p>The combative Randall is hardly classic Beeb material. A tough taskmaster, though said to be fun to work for, he won't stand for meetings about meetings, paranoid navel-gazing or the 'on the one hand, on the other' school of dull reporting. He made his name as City editor of the Sunday Times under Andrew Neil in the Eighties, cultivating personalities - self-made tycoons such as Gerald Ronson, Alan Sugar and George Walker - to produce a string of business scoops. </p> <p> Sunday Business , where Neil is again his boss and the secretive Barclay brothers his paymasters, has been a sur prising success since Randall relaunched maverick publisher Tom Rubython's discredited title three years ago. On sales of 60,000 a week, losses have fallen sharply and the paper is now heading for the black, insiders say. </p> <p>But Randall is not just a reporter in the business game; he is now very much a player. He was instrumental, for example, in the \u00a3550 million break-up of the Sears retail empire, which included Warehouse and Miss Selfridge: he persuaded the Barclays to stump up the cash for his pal Philip Green. And he used his contacts with Rupert Murdoch last year to broker a settlement of Belize billionaire Michael Ashcroft's libel suit against the Times. </p> <p>There's no doubt that the straight-talking, sports-mad Dyke and Randall hit it off like a stadium on fire. 'It's all part of Greg getting his team around him: all blokes, all mates and no bullshit,' said one BBC insider. But, like Terry Venables with the Football Association, can Randall resist the player within and put up with stuffed shirts at the BBC for the full five years of his contract? </p> <p><strong> Four big business stories the BBC screwed up</strong></p> <p><strong>Vodafone/Mannesmann:</strong> </p> <p>Worth a record \u00a390 billion, the mobile phone bid - creating Britain's biggest company - was missed by BBC News when it was announced before Christmas last year. </p> <p><strong> The supermarket inquiry:</strong> </p> <p>The BBC led its news bulletin on the DTI's whitewash of 'Rip Off Britain' last month. But its coverage - with reporters filling grocery baskets at checkouts around Europe - was lazy, missed the point, and embarrassed Dyke. </p> <p>The BBC treated Rover's divorce from BMW like a 1970s industrial relations story, even dragging out 'Red Robbo' for his views. The crippling effect of Rover on its German parent and the bust-ups throughout at BMW received scant emphasis. </p> <p><strong> Ford's price cuts</strong> </p> <p>The BBC gave great play to Ford's discounting this summer from a consumer angle. But, typically, it failed to give any perspective on Ford's tough market position, low UK profits and the growing pressure on the car giant in the US.</p>",

'Barely disguised contempt' is how insiders sum up Dyke's attitude to his economics pontificator-in-chief. The antipathy dates back to 1983, when Dyke rescued TV-am from its founding intellectuals, led by Jay, with a little help from his furry friend Roland Rat. After a decade with the Corporation, 63-year-old Jay's contract will not be renewed when it ends next year. Randall's appointment means three of the BBC's five specialist editors now have a definite print background. Andrew Marr, brought in as political editor to shunt out the affable Robin Oakley, edited the Independent, and Niall Dixon, social affairs editor, ran the Nursing Times . Auntie's public broadcasting types may sniff, but the print bias is hardly shocking. Dyke, who made his reputation and his millions in TV, is a former tabloid journalist. Also, TV news often feeds off newspapers' exclusives - nowhere more so than in business. The BBC's new economics and business unit, brought under one roof last year, employs 100 journalists, yet insiders are hard-pushed to recall a single big scoop. 'When you look at the firepower we have, a lot of our output is purely on-diary,' one critical BBC insider said. 'The business world is as much about exclusives as any other. Jeff lives and breathes scoops. ITV is even worse, and we really must do better.' A devourer of 24-hour business channels such as CNBC and Bloomberg News, Dyke is already putting licence-payers' money where his mouth is. Last month, the BBC's 30-year-old business flagship, The Money Programme , switched from a formulaic, presenter-led magazine on a Sunday night to a single-issue format broadcast in midweek. In December, BBC2's Working Lunch, will trial a 60-minute midday slot, against half-an-hour now. BBC Online , fighting umpteen internet news rivals, is about to double its business staff. Next autumn, the Beeb launches its new BBC3 and BBC4 digital TV channels. 'BBC4 will be current affairs, arts and definitely a daily business programme - a sort of Radio 4 agenda for TV,' one BBC executive said. 'BBC3's 18-35 audience will also have youngsters aspiring to be internet zillionaires. But the real battleground is getting more into the Rolls-Royce: the bulletins on BBC1.' The combative Randall is hardly classic Beeb material. A tough taskmaster, though said to be fun to work for, he won't stand for meetings about meetings, paranoid navel-gazing or the 'on the one hand, on the other' school of dull reporting. He made his name as City editor of the Sunday Times under Andrew Neil in the Eighties, cultivating personalities - self-made tycoons such as Gerald Ronson, Alan Sugar and George Walker - to produce a string of business scoops. Sunday Business , where Neil is again his boss and the secretive Barclay brothers his paymasters, has been a sur prising success since Randall relaunched maverick publisher Tom Rubython's discredited title three years ago. On sales of 60,000 a week, losses have fallen sharply and the paper is now heading for the black, insiders say. But Randall is not just a reporter in the business game; he is now very much a player. He was instrumental, for example, in the \u00a3550 million break-up of the Sears retail empire, which included Warehouse and Miss Selfridge: he persuaded the Barclays to stump up the cash for his pal Philip Green. And he used his contacts with Rupert Murdoch last year to broker a settlement of Belize billionaire Michael Ashcroft's libel suit against the Times. There's no doubt that the straight-talking, sports-mad Dyke and Randall hit it off like a stadium on fire. 'It's all part of Greg getting his team around him: all blokes, all mates and no bullshit,' said one BBC insider. But, like Terry Venables with the Football Association, can Randall resist the player within and put up with stuffed shirts at the BBC for the full five years of his contract? Four big business stories the BBC screwed up Vodafone/Mannesmann: Worth a record \u00a390 billion, the mobile phone bid - creating Britain's biggest company - was missed by BBC News when it was announced before Christmas last year. The supermarket inquiry: The BBC led its news bulletin on the DTI's whitewash of 'Rip Off Britain' last month. But its coverage - with reporters filling grocery baskets at checkouts around Europe - was lazy, missed the point, and embarrassed Dyke. The BBC treated Rover's divorce from BMW like a 1970s industrial relations story, even dragging out 'Red Robbo' for his views. The crippling effect of Rover on its German parent and the bust-ups throughout at BMW received scant emphasis. Ford's price cuts The BBC gave great play to Ford's discounting this summer from a consumer angle. But, typically, it failed to give any perspective on Ford's tough market position, low UK profits and the growing pressure on the car giant in the US.",

      "body": "<p>To a Geordie working-class boy growing up in the Fifties, knowing a man who had been on the Jarrow March was the equivalent of a Sloane Ranger knowing a man who once knew a girl who danced with the Prince of Wales.</p> <p>I was fortunate enough to know Sammy Rowan, the man with the cigarette in the foreground of that defining picture taken as the rain-soaked marchers arrived in London in 1936, after 291 miles and three weeks on the road.</p> <p>My father, who was a friend of Sammy, took me to meet him when I left school in Hebburn-on-Tyne hoping to get into journalism. For someone who had been the administrator on a crusade to find work for 8,000 men in the year I was born, Sammy was in an appropriate job when I met him in 1952. He was the youth employment officer for Jarrow and Hebburn.</p> <p>He couldn't help me directly, for his skills were deployed mainly in placing boys in the shipyards or engineering factories that were then booming on Tyneside. But he was a kind man, and his knowledge of how the press worked - gleaned from the hours he had spent briefing them during the march - enabled him to give me some good advice. I should write to the news editor, not the editor, of the local newspaper, and I should enrol in evening classes for shorthand and typing so that I could mention it in my letter.</p> <p>His advice must have helped, for I got the job and I'm now able to pay tribute to the late Sammy Rowan. I want to put on record that he would be dismayed and angered at the way the ethos of the Jarrow March has been hijacked and traduced by the hauliers and the farmers who set out on their drive from his town on Friday.</p> <p>Sitting in the warm cab of a lorry with country and western on the radio and a Yorkie on the dashboard is so far removed from the ideals and experiences of the Jarrow marchers that it's almost obscene.</p> <p>The haulier is not leaving behind him children who have rickets or who are so undernourished that they don't have the stamina for a full day at school. I doubt, too, if he leaves behind a wife getting thin, unintentionally, because she apportions more food to her man and her children than she does to herself.</p> <p>The farmer in his four-wheel-drive has never known the humiliation of spending 15 years without work, unable to support his family, which was the experience of many Jarrow workers who joined that march in 1936.</p> <p>Even if every haulier and every farmer went bankrupt, the Government they vilify would not let them go hungry. Many people in Jarrow did go hungry in the Thirties, though the organisers of the march went to great lengths to stress that it was a crusade to bring work to the town and not a hunger march.</p> <p>Seebohm Rowntree, the leading social scientist of the day, and founder of the Rowntree Trust, calculated that the bare necessity for survival for a man with a wife and three children required an income of 53 shillings a week (\u00a32. 65 in today's money).

      "bodyText": "To a Geordie working-class boy growing up in the Fifties, knowing a man who had been on the Jarrow March was the equivalent of a Sloane Ranger knowing a man who once knew a girl who danced with the Prince of Wales. I was fortunate enough to know Sammy Rowan, the man with the cigarette in the foreground of that defining picture taken as the rain-soaked marchers arrived in London in 1936, after 291 miles and three weeks on the road. My father, who was a friend of Sammy, took me to meet him when I left school in Hebburn-on-Tyne hoping to get into journalism. For someone who had been the administrator on a crusade to find work for 8,000 men in the year I was born, Sammy was in an appropriate job when I met him in 1952. He was the youth employment officer for Jarrow and Hebburn. He couldn't help me directly, for his skills were deployed mainly in placing boys in the shipyards or engineering factories that were then booming on Tyneside. But he was a kind man, and his knowledge of how the press worked - gleaned from the hours he had spent briefing them during the march - enabled him to give me some good advice. I should write to the news editor, not the editor, of the local newspaper, and I should enrol in evening classes for shorthand and typing so that I could mention it in my letter. His advice must have helped, for I got the job and I'm now able to pay tribute to the late Sammy Rowan. I want to put on record that he would be dismayed and angered at the way the ethos of the Jarrow March has been hijacked and traduced by the hauliers and the farmers who set out on their drive from his town on Friday. Sitting in the warm cab of a lorry with country and western on the radio and a Yorkie on the dashboard is so far removed from the ideals and experiences of the Jarrow marchers that it's almost obscene. The haulier is not leaving behind him children who have rickets or who are so undernourished that they don't have the stamina for a full day at school. I doubt, too, if he leaves behind a wife getting thin, unintentionally, because she apportions more food to her man and her children than she does to herself. The farmer in his four-wheel-drive has never known the humiliation of spending 15 years without work, unable to support his family, which was the experience of many Jarrow workers who joined that march in 1936. Even if every haulier and every farmer went bankrupt, the Government they vilify would not let them go hungry. Many people in Jarrow did go hungry in the Thirties, though the organisers of the march went to great lengths to stress that it was a crusade to bring work to the town and not a hunger march. Seebohm Rowntree, the leading social scientist of the day, and founder of the Rowntree Trust, calculated that the bare necessity for survival for a man with a wife and three children required an income of 53 shillings a week (\u00a32. 65 in today's money). But unemployment benefit for such a family was 32 shillings (\u00a31.60) a week. 'There is no escape anywhere from the prevailing misery,' wrote J.B. Priestley, visiting Jarrow for his book, An English Journey. 'Wherever we went there were men hanging about, not scores of them, but hundreds and thousands of them. The whole town looked as if it had entered a penniless bleak Sabbath.' Yet Jarrow had been one of the greatest industrial centres in the world. The Palmer steelworks and shipyard could take in iron ore at one end of its river frontage and turn out battleships and liners at the other. When Palmer's closed in the world slump between 1920 and 1931, 74 per cent of all the workers in Jarrow became unemployed. Grass grew over the launching ways. The enforced idleness of the men on the street corners was like an indefinite prison sentence. To try to end this despair the whole town got together behind the idea of the march on London - a unique initiative, for it was organised by the town council and had the support of all the political parties in Jarrow, and all the churches. It was truly a town march, to present a petition to Parliament asking for work. And just in case anyone doubted this, two of the 200 men on the march were chosen each day to carry the box containing the petition, slung reverentially between them on silken cords as if it were the Ark of the Covenant. In thinking of the late Sammy Rowan and what the Jarrow marchers did then compared with what the fuel protesters are doing now, I'm reminded of David Dougan's definition in his history of the march: 'It did not represent a faction or a dissatisfied segment of society. It represented all the people of Jarrow, irrespective of political party, religion or position, acting together for their common good.'

Will the 'green' car idea finally have its day and, first and foremost, does it actually exist? </p> <p>Nick Reilly, chief executive of UK-based carmaker Vauxhall, says: 'Nations are making commitments to reduce carbon dioxide levels and I am sure once we reach those levels, further targets will be set. There is only so far you can go with the internal combustion engine, and it is very important that we explore different directions.' </p> <p>The good news is that whereas five years ago these issues were hardly on the industrial radar screen, now all the world's major motor manufacturers have huge 'green' programmes and boast senior executives with titles such as 'vice-president, environment'. </p> <p>The prize for the company that cracks the formula for the green car of the future before its rivals will be measured in trillions of dollars. The prize for the human race will be cleaner air. </p> <p>The bad news is that those same companies have found that solving the technology problem of alternative fuels is taking more time and money than they expected. </p> <p>And Britain has a poor track record for both running green cars, and for subsidising green schemes and encouraging wind and wave power. This is despite the UK having some of the worst congestion and pollution, the highest level of car dependency - and more wind and waves than anywhere in Europe. </p> <p>But while the most obvious alternatives to the car are still public transport, two-wheelers or working from home, alternative-fuel vehicles are moving up the agenda - especially with the railways in chaos. </p> <p>Leading car makers such as Ford, General Motors (Vauxhall's parent), Honda, Toyota and Daimler-Chrysler are all busy researching what they see as the most likely future alternatives to petrol and diesel - and some are greener than others. </p> <p>Most agree that the long-term solution will be cars powered by fuel cells that run on the electrical current generated when you combine hydrogen and oxygen through a catalytic membrane. It's likely to be the winning technology because it is the most efficient and will give the most power for the lowest emissions. </p> <p>But fuel cells are proving devilishly difficult to perfect at anything like an affordable price, and are some way off entering the mainstream. </p> <p>Other avenues of exploration are battery power, bio-diesel made from vegetable oil and methanol, liquid petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas, compressed natural gas and hybrid engines that supplement fossil fuel power with electric power. Prototype vehicles running on any of these alternatives are already in evidence here and there around the globe. </p> <p>Matthew Spencer, energy campaign director for environmental group Greenpeace, says: 'Until these vehicles are delivered to car showrooms, you have to remain a bit sceptical about the manufacturers' claims to have seen the light. We don't want prototypes any more; we want the real thing. But these companies are much keener to sell huge, gas-guzzling off-road cars and people-carriers than the smallest, most fuel-efficient cars.' </p> <p>At the British Motor Show in Birmingham last month, Japan's Honda claimed it would have fuel cell cars on sale by 2003, narrowly beating Ford and GM to market. </p> <p>Honda's general manager of car sales in the UK, Mark Davies, says: 'That's a pretty steep target. It is not so much the technology that's hard to crack; it is making it cost- effective. At the moment a fuel-cell Honda Civic would cost \u00a3150,000, and no one is going to buy that.' </p> <p>But Honda has made something to bridge the gap. In September it launched the hybrid-engined Civic, which so far has sold about 60 in the UK. Each one costs \u00a324,000 to make but has a retail price tag of \u00a317,000. If they were more popular this would be a substantial loss but with the price of a regular Civic averaging \u00a314,000, the company is forced to subsidise the hybrid. Even at that price, it is only for the dedicated. </p> <p>The hybrid looks like a regular Civic except that half of the boot space is taken up by a battery. The four-cylinder engine has effectively had one of its cylinders chopped off and replaced by an electric motor that supplements the normal engine power. </p> <p>When the car decelerates, the frictional energy that creates is drawn off the engine and stored in the battery. When the car speeds up that stored energy is released to boost the power of the petrol engine - giving the three-cylinder, 1,000cc engine the equivalent power of 1,600cc and four cylinders. </p> <p>Honda claims it feels like a normal car to drive and gives a typical 83 miles per gallon, compared with its regular Civic cousin's 42mpg. </p> <p>Davies says: 'I drove one for two weeks during the last fuel crisis and thought it would feel like a milk float, but it was nippy and enormous fun to drive.' </p> <p>It must have been particular fun to drive past the filling station queues. </p> <p>Davies says: 'I believe that fossil fuels will be firmly with us for the next 10 to 15 years while we are developing the fuel cell and experimenting with electricity. I still believe the internal combustion engine will be around, but we must strive for virtually zero-emissions vehicles.' </p> <p>Some leading car makers have contracted out the work of researching alternative fuels to smaller, specialist companies, or have formed partnerships with those companies. </p> <p>Westport Innovations, based in Vancouver, is working for Ford on switching diesel engines to run on natural gas, which is half the price of diesel and about one- twentieth as 'dirty'. It is focusing its research on Ford's diesel engine plant at Dagenham, Essex, and with German truck maker Mann. </p> <p>Westport chief executive David Demers says the rewards for the companies that produce the most successful alternatives to petrol and diesel vehicles for the future are enormous. The worldwide annual sale of new vehicles is worth about $1 trillion, and sale of fuel to power them around $2 trillion. </p> <p>Demers says: 'I think the majority of new car sales will still be powered by traditional methods in 20 years' time, although they will be much more efficient and probably totally recyclable. But even if that means almost half the market is taken up by alternative-fuel vehicles, that is huge potential.' </p> <p>The motor manufacturers have based their business on petrol engines for more than 100 years and it is hardly surprising that they and the big oil companies have been reluctant to sing from the green song sheet. </p> <p>Demers concludes: 'All the innovations are very exciting, but I do not think we will be getting away from the internal combustion engine for at least another 50 years.' </p> <p><strong>The speech in full</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394543,00.html\">Part 1: the economy</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394550,00.html\">Part 2: the fiscal stance</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394552,00.html\">Part 3: families and pensioners</a></p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/politics/story/0,3604,394223,00.html\">8 November 2000: Pensioners call at No 10 - Guardian</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394362,00.html\">8 November 2000, explained: the pre-budget report </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,394122,00.html\">8 November 2000, analysis: My friends the truckers - Leanda de Lisle</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/welfare/\">Related special report: welfare reform</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">Related special report: New Labour in power</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/petrol/\">Related special report: the petrol war</a></p>",

This is despite the UK having some of the worst congestion and pollution, the highest level of car dependency - and more wind and waves than anywhere in Europe. But while the most obvious alternatives to the car are still public transport, two-wheelers or working from home, alternative-fuel vehicles are moving up the agenda - especially with the railways in chaos. Leading car makers such as Ford, General Motors (Vauxhall's parent), Honda, Toyota and Daimler-Chrysler are all busy researching what they see as the most likely future alternatives to petrol and diesel - and some are greener than others. Most agree that the long-term solution will be cars powered by fuel cells that run on the electrical current generated when you combine hydrogen and oxygen through a catalytic membrane. It's likely to be the winning technology because it is the most efficient and will give the most power for the lowest emissions. But fuel cells are proving devilishly difficult to perfect at anything like an affordable price, and are some way off entering the mainstream. Other avenues of exploration are battery power, bio-diesel made from vegetable oil and methanol, liquid petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas, compressed natural gas and hybrid engines that supplement fossil fuel power with electric power. Prototype vehicles running on any of these alternatives are already in evidence here and there around the globe. Matthew Spencer, energy campaign director for environmental group Greenpeace, says: 'Until these vehicles are delivered to car showrooms, you have to remain a bit sceptical about the manufacturers' claims to have seen the light. We don't want prototypes any more; we want the real thing. But these companies are much keener to sell huge, gas-guzzling off-road cars and people-carriers than the smallest, most fuel-efficient cars.' At the British Motor Show in Birmingham last month, Japan's Honda claimed it would have fuel cell cars on sale by 2003, narrowly beating Ford and GM to market. Honda's general manager of car sales in the UK, Mark Davies, says: 'That's a pretty steep target. It is not so much the technology that's hard to crack; it is making it cost- effective. At the moment a fuel-cell Honda Civic would cost \u00a3150,000, and no one is going to buy that.' But Honda has made something to bridge the gap. In September it launched the hybrid-engined Civic, which so far has sold about 60 in the UK. Each one costs \u00a324,000 to make but has a retail price tag of \u00a317,000. If they were more popular this would be a substantial loss but with the price of a regular Civic averaging \u00a314,000, the company is forced to subsidise the hybrid. Even at that price, it is only for the dedicated. The hybrid looks like a regular Civic except that half of the boot space is taken up by a battery. The four-cylinder engine has effectively had one of its cylinders chopped off and replaced by an electric motor that supplements the normal engine power. When the car decelerates, the frictional energy that creates is drawn off the engine and stored in the battery. When the car speeds up that stored energy is released to boost the power of the petrol engine - giving the three-cylinder, 1,000cc engine the equivalent power of 1,600cc and four cylinders. Honda claims it feels like a normal car to drive and gives a typical 83 miles per gallon, compared with its regular Civic cousin's 42mpg. Davies says: 'I drove one for two weeks during the last fuel crisis and thought it would feel like a milk float, but it was nippy and enormous fun to drive.' It must have been particular fun to drive past the filling station queues. Davies says: 'I believe that fossil fuels will be firmly with us for the next 10 to 15 years while we are developing the fuel cell and experimenting with electricity. I still believe the internal combustion engine will be around, but we must strive for virtually zero-emissions vehicles.' Some leading car makers have contracted out the work of researching alternative fuels to smaller, specialist companies, or have formed partnerships with those companies. Westport Innovations, based in Vancouver, is working for Ford on switching diesel engines to run on natural gas, which is half the price of diesel and about one- twentieth as 'dirty'. It is focusing its research on Ford's diesel engine plant at Dagenham, Essex, and with German truck maker Mann. Westport chief executive David Demers says the rewards for the companies that produce the most successful alternatives to petrol and diesel vehicles for the future are enormous. The worldwide annual sale of new vehicles is worth about $1 trillion, and sale of fuel to power them around $2 trillion. Demers says: 'I think the majority of new car sales will still be powered by traditional methods in 20 years' time, although they will be much more efficient and probably totally recyclable. But even if that means almost half the market is taken up by alternative-fuel vehicles, that is huge potential.' The motor manufacturers have based their business on petrol engines for more than 100 years and it is hardly surprising that they and the big oil companies have been reluctant to sing from the green song sheet. Demers concludes: 'All the innovations are very exciting, but I do not think we will be getting away from the internal combustion engine for at least another 50 years.'

      "body": "<p>The conservatives were right to dub Gordon Brown's Pre-Budget Report a 'Post-Budget Report' - post-Budget 2000, that is, rather than pre-Budget 2001 (as New Labour likes to call these things.) Last March the Chancellor had no intention of making concessions to pensioners. He was aware of the pensioners' history, Lady Barbara Castle and Jack Jones, but dismissive of it. </p> <p>The trick he missed at the time was to emphasise that it was because of the Government's success in controlling inflation that the adjustment for prices was only 75p. But the mere fact that the rise was so low would in any case have drawn attention to how low the basic state pension is - at the lower end of the cost of dinner for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown at Islington's Granita restaurant. </p> <p>The Chancellor's new 'pensioners' package' is a recognition of political reality - of the fact that the pensioners' lobby gathered strength during the spring and summer, turning up in force at the Labour Conference. The 'short-termism' of boasting that he is 'giving away' more than would be required by indexing pensions to earnings is pretty barefaced. There is no long-term commitment to indexing pensions to earnings, except for those qualifying for the minimum income guarantee and 'low- and modest-income pensioners'. Qualifying requires filling in vast forms, whose complexity has been known to defeat doctors of philosophy. </p> <p>When Brown came to office, he promised the biggest welfare reforms since Beveridge and the 1945-50 inception of the welfare state under the Attlee government. The whole idea of the welfare state was that it offered decent state provision when necessary 'from cradle to grave'. It was a system of national insurance under which people paid their contributions and got their legitimate reward in time of sickness and in old age. </p> <p>Despite the electoral goodies being offered to pensioners in the Pre-Budget Report - and the money is certainly a lot more generous than originally envis aged - New Labour has now basically accepted the Conservative plan to erode the value of the state pension over time and make private pensions a necessary precaution of old age. </p> <p>There is no doubting Brown's good intentions, nor his and his strategists' desire to do as much as they can within the narrow confines of what they think their focus groups will permit, to 'redistribute' income and heal the poor. But it is interesting that it took a pensioners' revolt to push them this far, and the fact is that after all these years, there is a lot of ground to make up. Nevertheless, all pensioners do well in the short term, and the Conservative plan to remove their perks is just bad politics. </p> <p>Which brings us to the other revolt, that of the fuel protesters. Despite the scorn that has been poured on the Chancellor from all sides, it is pretty obvious that in the world of practical politics he had little alternative but to demonstrate that, while not being prepared to cave in completely to their demands, he had to show he was listening. What happened during the protesters' first revolt gave the Government a bigger fright than it was ever prepared to admit. Ironically, it had been on to the general movement for some time; indeed the last Budget demonstrated that it knew the point of resistance to fuel taxes had been reached. It was the degree of resistance that took Ministers unawares. So more concessions had to be made. </p> <p>Chancellors are sometimes credited with inventing new taxes; to judge from the reactions, Brown has almost been credited with inventing a new fuel. Few people seemed even to have heard of 'low-sulphur petrol' on 'Budget day'. Now, no doubt in return for a distinct absence of a windfall levy on their profits, the oil companies will be serving it to all and sundry by Easter. </p> <p>Contrary to what some sceptics have claimed, there is indeed an environmental aspect to the fiscal incentive to shift to low-sulphur fuels. Scientific research indicates that sulphurous emissions can damage your health and your forests. On the other hand there appears to be precious little connection with that great concern of our time, global warming. This is not a Budget to eliminate or even reduce floods. </p> <p>The pensioners' package and the relief for road hauliers were the main constituents of what it is fair to describe as a 'mini-Budget'. When Brown came to office he tended to deride the old-fashioned practice of 'mini-Budgets'; but he has deemed it judicious, rightly in my view, to bow to 'events, dear boy, events'. </p> <p>But this is not a mini-Budget in the old sense of being introduced in an economic emergency to boost or rein back demand and economic activity. It is a mini-Budget because of a political emergency. The cost of the pensions and road haulage packages is put at \u00a34 billion a year; but it so happens that because of the buoyancy of the economy, income and other tax receipts are running at over \u00a34bn a year more than expected at the time of the March Budget. There is very little change in fiscal balance. </p> <p>This is in accord with the Chancellor's philosophy, which is to leave economic management almost entirely to the Bank of England, once he has set out his spending priorities. These have been simple: to freeze and save in the early years of his chancellorship - to gain a reputation for fiscal prudence; and to increase public spending more rapidly than gross domestic product during the second phase - to do something about the nation's obvious discontents. </p> <p>Time and time again the Chancellor has emphasised that he has a 'golden rule' for the nation's finances. To quote the Pre-Budget Report: 'The Government will borrow only to invest and not fund current spending.' Many observers are under the impression that he aims to balance the current Budget over the economic cycle. But he goes further than that. The report states that 'it [the golden rule] is met when, over the economic cycle, the current budget is in balance or surplus '. </p> <p>Contrary to the popular impression, he cannot 'spend' much of any surplus at a time of near full employment without prompting the Bank of England's monetary policy committee to raise interest rates to keep the economy in balance. There was careful consideration between Treasury and Bank before the Pre-Budget Report was launched, and the committee made its no-change decision on interest rates last week. </p> <p>But over the next few years the current surplus is forecast to halve from 1.5 per cent of GDP this financial year to 0.7 per cent in 2004-05, while the overall finances move from a surplus of 0.8 per cent of GDP in 2000-01 to a deficit of 1.1 per cent in 2004-05 (as measured by what the Treasury calls cyclically adjusted public-sector net borrowing). This reflects the fact that public spending is due to rise at some 3.5 per cent a year, against an estimated 2.5 per cent average growth rate for the economy as a whole. </p> <p>The Chancellor's report takes pride in the state of the finances, buoyancy of the economy, approach to full employment and low level of inflation. But it reflects a continuing concern with the UK's low levels of productivity, and once again many of the proposed micro tax measures are aimed one way or another at improving productivity. </p> <p>Beneath the upbeat pre-election tone of much of the presentation lie other sources of unease. The report notes that 'business investment has decelerated significantly since early 1999' - from 7.5 per cent growth to a mere 1.75 per cent this year. </p> <p>This reflects 'weaker output growth and declining profitability'. It says firms 'have responded to sterling's overall strength by cutting export prices significantly'. Even so there has been a loss of market share. </p> <p>What prevented the overvaluation of the pound from having a much greater impact than it has had so far was a dramatic doubling in the rate of the world trade growth between 1999 and this year, to 11 per cent. Our export markets are estimated to have grown at 9.25 per cent, but exports at only 8 per cent, while 'import penetration has risen significantly'. The Pre-Budget Report forecasts, on present trends, a rising trade deficit in goods and services, reaching a cumulative \u00a3112 bn. over the five years 1999-2003 inclusive. </p> <p>It is difficult to see how a trade deficit of this magnitude can be sustained indefinitely, but this will be a problem for the next parliament. The Chancellor has done everything he can to make sure he personally inherits that crisis. </p> <p><strong>The speech in full</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394543,00.html\">Part 1: the economy</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394550,00.html\">Part 2: the fiscal stance</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394552,00.html\">Part 3: families and pensioners</a></p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/politics/story/0,3604,394223,00.html\">8 November 2000: Pensioners call at No 10 - Guardian</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394362,00.html\">8 November 2000, explained: the pre-budget report </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,394122,00.html\">8 November 2000, analysis: My friends the truckers - Leanda de Lisle</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/welfare/\">Related special report: welfare reform</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">Related special report: New Labour in power</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/petrol/\">Related special report: the petrol war</a> </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.peoples-fuel-lobby.co.uk/\">Campaign - People's Fuel Lobby</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.rha.net/fairplay2000/\">Key player - the Road Haulage Association</a><br><a href=\"http://www.freighttaxes.com/\"> Key player - Freight Taxes.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.natpencon.org.uk/index.html\">Key player - National pensioners convention</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/1999/index.html\">Budgets and pre-budgets since 1994 - HM Treasury</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The conservatives were right to dub Gordon Brown's Pre-Budget Report a 'Post-Budget Report' - post-Budget 2000, that is, rather than pre-Budget 2001 (as New Labour likes to call these things.) Last March the Chancellor had no intention of making concessions to pensioners. He was aware of the pensioners' history, Lady Barbara Castle and Jack Jones, but dismissive of it. The trick he missed at the time was to emphasise that it was because of the Government's success in controlling inflation that the adjustment for prices was only 75p. But the mere fact that the rise was so low would in any case have drawn attention to how low the basic state pension is - at the lower end of the cost of dinner for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown at Islington's Granita restaurant. The Chancellor's new 'pensioners' package' is a recognition of political reality - of the fact that the pensioners' lobby gathered strength during the spring and summer, turning up in force at the Labour Conference. The 'short-termism' of boasting that he is 'giving away' more than would be required by indexing pensions to earnings is pretty barefaced. There is no long-term commitment to indexing pensions to earnings, except for those qualifying for the minimum income guarantee and 'low- and modest-income pensioners'. Qualifying requires filling in vast forms, whose complexity has been known to defeat doctors of philosophy. When Brown came to office, he promised the biggest welfare reforms since Beveridge and the 1945-50 inception of the welfare state under the Attlee government. The whole idea of the welfare state was that it offered decent state provision when necessary 'from cradle to grave'. It was a system of national insurance under which people paid their contributions and got their legitimate reward in time of sickness and in old age. Despite the electoral goodies being offered to pensioners in the Pre-Budget Report - and the money is certainly a lot more generous than originally envis aged - New Labour has now basically accepted the Conservative plan to erode the value of the state pension over time and make private pensions a necessary precaution of old age. There is no doubting Brown's good intentions, nor his and his strategists' desire to do as much as they can within the narrow confines of what they think their focus groups will permit, to 'redistribute' income and heal the poor. But it is interesting that it took a pensioners' revolt to push them this far, and the fact is that after all these years, there is a lot of ground to make up. Nevertheless, all pensioners do well in the short term, and the Conservative plan to remove their perks is just bad politics. Which brings us to the other revolt, that of the fuel protesters. Despite the scorn that has been poured on the Chancellor from all sides, it is pretty obvious that in the world of practical politics he had little alternative but to demonstrate that, while not being prepared to cave in completely to their demands, he had to show he was listening. What happened during the protesters' first revolt gave the Government a bigger fright than it was ever prepared to admit. Ironically, it had been on to the general movement for some time; indeed the last Budget demonstrated that it knew the point of resistance to fuel taxes had been reached. It was the degree of resistance that took Ministers unawares. So more concessions had to be made. Chancellors are sometimes credited with inventing new taxes; to judge from the reactions, Brown has almost been credited with inventing a new fuel. Few people seemed even to have heard of 'low-sulphur petrol' on 'Budget day'. Now, no doubt in return for a distinct absence of a windfall levy on their profits, the oil companies will be serving it to all and sundry by Easter. Contrary to what some sceptics have claimed, there is indeed an environmental aspect to the fiscal incentive to shift to low-sulphur fuels. Scientific research indicates that sulphurous emissions can damage your health and your forests. On the other hand there appears to be precious little connection with that great concern of our time, global warming. This is not a Budget to eliminate or even reduce floods. The pensioners' package and the relief for road hauliers were the main constituents of what it is fair to describe as a 'mini-Budget'. When Brown came to office he tended to deride the old-fashioned practice of 'mini-Budgets'; but he has deemed it judicious, rightly in my view, to bow to 'events, dear boy, events'. But this is not a mini-Budget in the old sense of being introduced in an economic emergency to boost or rein back demand and economic activity. It is a mini-Budget because of a political emergency. The cost of the pensions and road haulage packages is put at \u00a34 billion a year; but it so happens that because of the buoyancy of the economy, income and other tax receipts are running at over \u00a34bn a year more than expected at the time of the March Budget. There is very little change in fiscal balance. This is in accord with the Chancellor's philosophy, which is to leave economic management almost entirely to the Bank of England, once he has set out his spending priorities. These have been simple: to freeze and save in the early years of his chancellorship - to gain a reputation for fiscal prudence; and to increase public spending more rapidly than gross domestic product during the second phase - to do something about the nation's obvious discontents. Time and time again the Chancellor has emphasised that he has a 'golden rule' for the nation's finances. To quote the Pre-Budget Report: 'The Government will borrow only to invest and not fund current spending.' Many observers are under the impression that he aims to balance the current Budget over the economic cycle. But he goes further than that. The report states that 'it [the golden rule] is met when, over the economic cycle, the current budget is in balance or surplus '. Contrary to the popular impression, he cannot 'spend' much of any surplus at a time of near full employment without prompting the Bank of England's monetary policy committee to raise interest rates to keep the economy in balance. There was careful consideration between Treasury and Bank before the Pre-Budget Report was launched, and the committee made its no-change decision on interest rates last week. But over the next few years the current surplus is forecast to halve from 1.5 per cent of GDP this financial year to 0.7 per cent in 2004-05, while the overall finances move from a surplus of 0.8 per cent of GDP in 2000-01 to a deficit of 1.1 per cent in 2004-05 (as measured by what the Treasury calls cyclically adjusted public-sector net borrowing). This reflects the fact that public spending is due to rise at some 3.5 per cent a year, against an estimated 2.5 per cent average growth rate for the economy as a whole. The Chancellor's report takes pride in the state of the finances, buoyancy of the economy, approach to full employment and low level of inflation. But it reflects a continuing concern with the UK's low levels of productivity, and once again many of the proposed micro tax measures are aimed one way or another at improving productivity. Beneath the upbeat pre-election tone of much of the presentation lie other sources of unease. The report notes that 'business investment has decelerated significantly since early 1999' - from 7.5 per cent growth to a mere 1.75 per cent this year. This reflects 'weaker output growth and declining profitability'. It says firms 'have responded to sterling's overall strength by cutting export prices significantly'. Even so there has been a loss of market share. What prevented the overvaluation of the pound from having a much greater impact than it has had so far was a dramatic doubling in the rate of the world trade growth between 1999 and this year, to 11 per cent. Our export markets are estimated to have grown at 9.25 per cent, but exports at only 8 per cent, while 'import penetration has risen significantly'. The Pre-Budget Report forecasts, on present trends, a rising trade deficit in goods and services, reaching a cumulative \u00a3112 bn. over the five years 1999-2003 inclusive. It is difficult to see how a trade deficit of this magnitude can be sustained indefinitely, but this will be a problem for the next parliament. The Chancellor has done everything he can to make sure he personally inherits that crisis.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>While Americans were glued to the climax of the election last week, with presidential hopefuls jabbing and sparring in soundbites, the most magnetic candidate was on movie screens, not on the campaign trail. But in an added twist, the movie has led to a heated dispute among the filmmakers that threatens to upstage its success. </p> <p>The candidate was the fictional Senator Laine Hanson, a Democrat from Ohio, and, as played by Joan Allen in The Contender, she personalises the hot issues, including abortion, religion in schools, adultery, and pre-marital sexual shenanigans. Yet Allen, one of today's most talented and respected actresses, did not want her first leading role to be overly preachy. </p> <p>'I wanted Laine to be real, to be grounded and multi-dimensional,' says Allen. 'I didn't want her to be sanctimonious; maybe she did have a sex scandal, maybe not; maybe she did steal her friend's husband away, as her rivals claim. I liked the flaws.' </p> <p>In the film, written and directed by Rod Lurie, Laine is chosen by the President (Jeff Bridges) as his deputy after the Vice-Presi dent dies unexpectedly. But amid backroom machinations and Washington wheeling and dealing, her confirmation hearings quickly go negative. A fire-and-brimstone Republican congressman, Shelly Runyon (Gary Oldman, also one of the film's executive producers, effecting a perfect Midwest accent), dislikes Laine from the start and when sexually explicit pictures from her college days turn up, they give him ammunition. The problem is, Laine refuses to open her life up for dissection. </p> <p>The synopsis may sound like a Movie of the Week but Lurie, a former Los Angeles film critic with a taste for Seventies political films like The Candidate and All the President's Men, wisely keeps Allen's quiet dignity at the heart of the engrossing drama. She has unsurprisingly emerged as an early Oscar favourite. </p> <p>'I have a certain paranoia that people might be so fed up with politics they don't want to see a political film, but I think [the elections] feed into it,' says Allen. 'We all know how politicians conduct themselves. Having a sense of that, it was important to make the character as human as we could, by sticking a camera inside her life, almost in a documentary way.' </p> <p>Despite being played by Oldman, she says the congressman is not necessarily the villain. 'There will be people who come down on his side of the debate. It's not his politics, but his method of undoing her that is his flaw.' </p> <p>Two such people would be Oldman and his manager and co-producer, Douglas Urbanski. Oldman has been at the centre of a bitter row about the film's political soul, which has almost overshadowed the film's positive critical reception. It began with a magazine interview in which he implied that Lurie altered the political tone of the film while editing to appease Dreamworks, the studio that distributed it, and its Democrat-supporting co-chairmen Steven Spielberg, David Geffen, and Jeffrey Katzenberg. </p> <p>Oldman believes Runyon, the film's villain, was presented much more sympathetically in the original script and Lurie subsequently betrayed the film's principles after Dreamworks agreed to distribute the film. Since Dreamworks, the studio behind American Beauty and Gladiator , is often praised for its laissez faire attitude towards filmmakers, the accusations have caused a stir in Hollywood especially after Oldman failed to appear at the movie's premiere. </p> <p>Oldman says: 'I am a little disappointed that you have a company that waves the flag for artists and champions filmmakers such as Woody Allen, and it can't honour something that actually doesn't cost them anything.' Hollywood's liberal bias is hardly new. Election year has seen a procession of starry Democrats backing and funding Gore so Oldman's stance against such powerful figures seems brave and anomalous. </p> <p>He also complained that Lurie wrongheadedly called his character the villain in press material, and disputed Lurie's theory that he had experienced a type of 'Stockholm syndrome', supposedly oversympathising with his role. </p> <p>Urbanski has been more forthright, referring to the film as 'almost a Goebbels-like piece of propaganda', posing and answering what he regards as the crucial question. 'Would a publicly left-leaning company, which has made its politics an issue, release a left-leaning film?' he says. 'That's a fair question, but it's loaded. Gary and I stand behind the film; we've never said anything else. But the politics of the film as it ends up are quite different from the film we set out to make. But that's not down to Dreamworks - that's Rod Lurie. </p> <p>He adds: 'Neither Gary or I saw Runyon as the heavy of the film. Joan's character is an atheist and Gary's is the bad guy? But we were making a film that was in shades of grey, a Rorschach test; in the marketing and press material, Rod became contradictory. Was he influenced? I believe he just morphed. And he developed diarrhoea of the mouth. He began to talk about heroes and villains. He made a horrible comment about Stockholm syndrome, implying that one had to have a mental disorder to see a conservative as sympathetic. That's horrible. </p> <p>'And he reopened this idea from many years ago that Gary is cantankerous. Gary's a wonderful actor, and a terribly sweet man. He isn't cantankerous - he produced the film!' </p> <p>Lurie has held his corner but concedes: 'If this was an anti-Clinton film, I don't know if it would have ended up in Dreamworks.' But he stresses that nobody put pressure on him to change the political tone. 'I am a liberal. I have always been a liberal. Douglas thinks all intelligent people must be conservative.' </p> <p>Lurie may have changed how he saw Oldman's character, but he reportedly wrote the title character specifically with Allen in mind. She joined Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre Company in 1977, working alongside actors such as John Malkovich and Gary Sinise. She won a 1988 Best Actress Tony Award co-starring with Malkovich on Broadway in Burn This, and early roles in films including Tucker: A Man and His Dream and Ethan Frome led to back-to-back Best Supporting Actress Oscar nominations for Nixon (1995) and The Crucible (1996), and critically lauded performances in The Ice Storm and Pleasantville. In the latter, she adroitly played a Fifties TV sitcom character who discovers desire and sensuality. </p> <p>'There's always a subtext to everything Joan plays,' says Gary Ross, the writer and director of Pleasantville. 'A depth to the character that isn't in a moment or in a line, it's something that she creates underneath. That's what makes her such a remarkable actress. Joan not only finds the big idea, but the depth and the resonance in that idea. </p> <p>'For Pleasantville , she had to experience things as if they were entirely new. This was a character who was really more Eve in the garden than June Cleaver. So I needed someone with incredible acting chops, and she was my first and only choice. I begged her to do it, I didn't know anyone else who could bring that complexity.' </p> <p>Though she's direct and polite with a Middle-American blonde prettiness, one of Allen's specialities is women whose tough sexual and moral choices drive the plot. In addition to Pleasantville , she played a principled woman accused of witchcraft in The Crucible, a wife struggling with changing social mores in The Ice Storm and now she's The Contender, who won't play public games at the expense of her private life. </p> <p>'One commonality seems to be that they're the moral centre of the films,' says Allen. 'There is a sexuality operating, yes, though it's not overt. In The Contender, Laine has a confidence in herself that you don't ordinarily see; I mean, there's not much sexuality oozing out of female politicians. Laine believes that sex has no place in the political arena, but she is not unaware of its power.' </p> <p>Despite the fact that Lurie wrote the screenplay with her in mind, Allen, 44, knows that as far as power in Hollywood goes, actresses in their forties still have little of it. 'The older you get, the more difficult it is to find good roles,' she says. </p> <p>'I might have, I hope, a little easier time of it because I'm basically a character actress, and The Contender has now taken me into the central role. But when Rod shopped the script around to some studios, they wouldn't go along if I was attached. It's not that they don't respect my work - I do feel that I'm respected - it's about bankability. Rod raised the money independently. Maybe after The Contender it'll change, but it is frightening. There's a short list, and I'm not quite on it yet.' </p> <p>Allen, who lives in New York with her husband, actor Peter Friedman, and their six-year-old daughter Sadie, says that going back to the stage doesn't appeal to her at this point. 'I'm just not hungry for it,' she says. 'I keep hoping I'm going to get hungry for it again, but I'm not.' </p> <p>Is she hungry for a Best Actress nomination? Asked if she thinks she'll be the contender to beat at next year's Oscars, Allen smiles, looks skyward and shrugs. 'We'll see. People have mentioned it. If there's talk about nominations, it's a nice reflection that the performance is working and that the whole film is working.' </p> <p>Whether she gets an Oscar nod or not, Allen doesn't kid herself about the lack of good roles for women. Considering that, she says she might be hungry for something different. She'll next be seen as the sorceress Morgause in the TV mini-series The Mists of Avalon about the women in King Arthur's Camelot. </p> <p>'I liked playing John Travolta's wife in Face/Off because it was so different, though I didn't have any action scenes,' says Allen. 'In Mists of Avalon I got to cast spells! So it might be fun to do an Alien -type movie.'Whichever type of movie she chooses, Allen will surely be voted one of the best things in it. </p> <p>\u0095 The Contender screens at the Regus London Film Festival (020 7928 3232) next week, before going on general release.</p>",

      "byline": "Peter Standford",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The Sound of Music industry seems to grow in inverse proportion to the careers of the film's stars. Contrast the fortunes of Julie Andrews, now unable to sing and languishing on Hollywood's D-list, or Christopher Plummer, eking out a living in straight-to-video releases, with the cult status enjoyed by the celluloid tale of the von Trapps. The latest in a long line of renaissances has been The Sing-a-Long Sound of Music, a karaoke version doing brisk business in London, Dublin and New York.</p> <p>The film has developed a life of its own but, in the process, has devoured its cast. Plummer now speaks scathingly of 'the Sound of Mucus', while some of the minor characters are permanently trapped in their alter egos of 1965.</p> <p>Dan Truhitte, the Nazi telegram boy, Rolf, still reprises his 15 minutes of fame on the American cabaret circuit, complete with blond wig, and is currently trying to find a record label for Gazebo Songs, a shameless play on the location where he sang 'I am Sixteen Going on Seventeen' with the oldest von Trapp child, Liesl. Truhitte is a tragi-comic figure. His opposite number in that scene, Charmian Carr, is harder to place. Now in her late fifties, this week she publishes her autobiography, Forever Liesl. As the title suggests, 99 per cent of it is about the movie, as well it might be since she has had no acting career to speak of since and instead has taken on the mantle of a global ambassador for the film. Wherever there has been a Sound of Music festival in the intervening 35 years, Charmian Carr has been the guest of honour.</p> <p>Despite innumerable Christmas viewings of the film over the years, I fail to pick Carr out from the half-a-dozen middle-aged women in the dining room of the hotel where we have arranged to meet. The maitre d' has to direct me. Even as I sit down, I am not convinced. My recollection of Liesl is as a strapping lass in a pinafore dress. In front of me is Nancy Reagan's younger sister - tiny, bird-like and trussed up in tight-fitting clothes. It is only when she speaks that I am sure. Her voice is instantly recognisable as the one that announced to Fraulein Maria early in the film: 'I am 16 and I don't need a governess.'</p> <p>'They made me put on weight to play the part,' she explains. 'I was 21 playing 16 anyway and they thought if I was heavier it would make me look younger.' As she relives those few weeks of shooting almost four decades ago, there is no hint that she ever wearies of a story that she must have told a thousand times before. Commercially such an attitude undoubtedly makes sense. Her warm, sincere, self-deprecating style hits the perfect note, but there is, I sense, something more. For in talking about those times in Salzburg (where 70 per cent of the city's visitors now come to see the Sound of Music sights), she is also recounting her coming of age.

'He was terribly handsome and dashing, and as flirtatious with me as I was with him. If I was too old to be Liesl, he was only 34 and too young to be the Captain.'</p> <p>Carr has a sure touch in tapping into the on-going public affection for the film. Her book brims with anecdotes: Plummer turning up in tights and ballet shoes for rehearsals of the folk dance he performs with Andrews on the night of the ball; Plummer (again) refusing to carry Gretl as they set out for the hills because child actress Kymmie Karath was too heavy; Nicholas Hammond who played Kurt growing so fast during the filming that he shot up past his father; and Marni Nixon (Sister Sophia) revealing that she had dubbed Audrey Hepburn's singing in My Fair Lady.</p> <p>Of her own role, Carr tells how, just before she filmed the gazebo scene with Rolf, she fell and sprained her ankle. It had to be wrapped in a bandage that had been dyed the same colour as her tights.</p> <p>To the millions of people who have seen the film more times than is probably good for them, such stories will be manna from heaven, but for a wider audience Carr manages cleverly to bring the whole thing to life by including both personal revelations and rather acid asides, albeit sweetly wrapped.</p> <p>The question she's asked most often, she says, is what was Julie Andrews like. The answer appears to be not very nice. For all her love of children on screen, she had little to do with them off camera. 'Julie didn't go to Salzburg to make friends,' says Carr, 'she went there to make a movie.' </p> <p>She seems unsurprised by The Sound of Music's staying power with audiences. The Sing-a-Long Sound of Music has, she says, outed a camp, gay element amongst its fans. 'At another event in New York, I had to judge who had the best costume. There was one guy who was wearing a small gazebo over his face. When he turned one way, he was made up as Liesl. When he turned the other, he was Rolf.' </p> <p>Given the reverence with which she talks about her own experiences - the film, she writes, has made her 'wealthy spiritually' - I wonder whether she ever takes offence at such efforts. 'Not at all. Its not sacrilegious. If they didn't love the film so much, they wouldn't go to all that trouble.' And how does she feel about suddenly finding herself a gay icon? 'I feel great. I think of Judy Garland and I think of Bette Midler and then I think, gee that's good company to be in.' </p> <p>Another major fan of the film is the singer Michael Jackson.

One day she was contacted for professional advice by the singer whose Neverland Ranch was nearby. 'He came by and recognised me at once as Liesl. We became good friends. Michael and I were very close. I picked him up from hospital when he'd had his skin bleached, although he now denies he had that done. And I took him there when he had his first nose job.

      "bodyText": "The Sound of Music industry seems to grow in inverse proportion to the careers of the film's stars. Contrast the fortunes of Julie Andrews, now unable to sing and languishing on Hollywood's D-list, or Christopher Plummer, eking out a living in straight-to-video releases, with the cult status enjoyed by the celluloid tale of the von Trapps. The latest in a long line of renaissances has been The Sing-a-Long Sound of Music, a karaoke version doing brisk business in London, Dublin and New York. The film has developed a life of its own but, in the process, has devoured its cast. Plummer now speaks scathingly of 'the Sound of Mucus', while some of the minor characters are permanently trapped in their alter egos of 1965. Dan Truhitte, the Nazi telegram boy, Rolf, still reprises his 15 minutes of fame on the American cabaret circuit, complete with blond wig, and is currently trying to find a record label for Gazebo Songs, a shameless play on the location where he sang 'I am Sixteen Going on Seventeen' with the oldest von Trapp child, Liesl. Truhitte is a tragi-comic figure. His opposite number in that scene, Charmian Carr, is harder to place. Now in her late fifties, this week she publishes her autobiography, Forever Liesl. As the title suggests, 99 per cent of it is about the movie, as well it might be since she has had no acting career to speak of since and instead has taken on the mantle of a global ambassador for the film. Wherever there has been a Sound of Music festival in the intervening 35 years, Charmian Carr has been the guest of honour. Despite innumerable Christmas viewings of the film over the years, I fail to pick Carr out from the half-a-dozen middle-aged women in the dining room of the hotel where we have arranged to meet. The maitre d' has to direct me. Even as I sit down, I am not convinced. My recollection of Liesl is as a strapping lass in a pinafore dress. In front of me is Nancy Reagan's younger sister - tiny, bird-like and trussed up in tight-fitting clothes. It is only when she speaks that I am sure. Her voice is instantly recognisable as the one that announced to Fraulein Maria early in the film: 'I am 16 and I don't need a governess.' 'They made me put on weight to play the part,' she explains. 'I was 21 playing 16 anyway and they thought if I was heavier it would make me look younger.' As she relives those few weeks of shooting almost four decades ago, there is no hint that she ever wearies of a story that she must have told a thousand times before. Commercially such an attitude undoubtedly makes sense. Her warm, sincere, self-deprecating style hits the perfect note, but there is, I sense, something more. For in talking about those times in Salzburg (where 70 per cent of the city's visitors now come to see the Sound of Music sights), she is also recounting her coming of age. 'It was my first time away from home, when I became an adult and drank my first champagne.' With Plummer, in particular, there was sexual chemistry as he tinkled on the hotel's piano late at night and poured her brandies. 'He was terribly handsome and dashing, and as flirtatious with me as I was with him. If I was too old to be Liesl, he was only 34 and too young to be the Captain.' Carr has a sure touch in tapping into the on-going public affection for the film. Her book brims with anecdotes: Plummer turning up in tights and ballet shoes for rehearsals of the folk dance he performs with Andrews on the night of the ball; Plummer (again) refusing to carry Gretl as they set out for the hills because child actress Kymmie Karath was too heavy; Nicholas Hammond who played Kurt growing so fast during the filming that he shot up past his father; and Marni Nixon (Sister Sophia) revealing that she had dubbed Audrey Hepburn's singing in My Fair Lady. Of her own role, Carr tells how, just before she filmed the gazebo scene with Rolf, she fell and sprained her ankle. It had to be wrapped in a bandage that had been dyed the same colour as her tights. To the millions of people who have seen the film more times than is probably good for them, such stories will be manna from heaven, but for a wider audience Carr manages cleverly to bring the whole thing to life by including both personal revelations and rather acid asides, albeit sweetly wrapped. The question she's asked most often, she says, is what was Julie Andrews like. The answer appears to be not very nice. For all her love of children on screen, she had little to do with them off camera. 'Julie didn't go to Salzburg to make friends,' says Carr, 'she went there to make a movie.' She seems unsurprised by The Sound of Music's staying power with audiences. The Sing-a-Long Sound of Music has, she says, outed a camp, gay element amongst its fans.

Given the reverence with which she talks about her own experiences - the film, she writes, has made her 'wealthy spiritually' - I wonder whether she ever takes offence at such efforts. 'Not at all. Its not sacrilegious. If they didn't love the film so much, they wouldn't go to all that trouble.' And how does she feel about suddenly finding herself a gay icon? 'I feel great. I think of Judy Garland and I think of Bette Midler and then I think, gee that's good company to be in.' Another major fan of the film is the singer Michael Jackson.

      "body": "<p>As a film-maker, an influence and a physical presence (the only non-acting director to be recognisable the world over), Alfred Hitchcock has loomed over moviegoers for 70 years. The fascination with his life and work shows no signs of abating. When he was 60, there was just one book about him, written in French by Claude Chabrol and Eric Rohmer. There were half-a-dozen or so by the time of his death in 1980, and there's now a little library of studies, with extra space to be found on the shelves each year. </p> <p>The massive publicity attending the centenary of his birth in 1999 did little to stem the flow of interest. Last month saw the publication by the BFI of Susan Smith's Hitchcock: Suspense, Humour and Tone, and the release of Robert Zemeckis's What Lies Beneath, a homage to Rear Window. </p> <p>Later this month Faber will publish Peter Conrad's perceptive The Hitchcock Murders, and this week Dominik Moll's thriller Harry, He's Here to Help arrives in our cinemas, confirming that Hitchcock's legacy is in good hands down in the Auvergne. </p> <p>The film begins with an edgy casualness. One hot summer day, the 34-year-old Michel Pape (Laurent Lucas), a good-looking teacher of French to Japanese students, is driving south from Paris in his clapped-out saloon with his sensible wife, Claire (Mathilde Seigner), and three fractious little daughters. Their destination is the dilapidated old farmhouse on the foothills of the Monts du Cantal that they've bought with the help of his overbearing dentist father and his querulous mother and are doing up a little at a time. </p> <p>Like various Hitchcock characters, their lives are inviting intervention. In the men's lavatory at a motorway caf\u00e9, a good-looking, slightly flashy man introduces himself to Michel as an old friend he's not met for 20 years and who remembers their schooldays in astonishing detail. This stranger by a drain is called Harry Balestrero (Sergi Lopez), a name designed to set off alarm bells in the viewer's mind. Balestrero is the name of the innocent victim in The Wrong Man; Harry is the corpse that causes trouble in Vermont in Hitchcock's most extended exercise in rural mayhem in The Trouble With Harry. </p> <p>Harry, like Bruno in Strangers on a Train, is idle, aesthetically poised and independently wealthy, having inherited large sums from a despised father. Accompanied by his simple, sexy, patronised girlfriend (Sophie Guillemin), he insinuates himself into the lives of Michel, Claire and their children, sensing faultlines in their relationships and creating new ones. It begins with lollies for the kids, a lift in his air-conditioned Mercedes and a flattering concern for Michel having given up on the literary career that seemed to lie before him as a precocious schoolboy. </p> <p>Harry's one of those people who knows more about you than you know yourself and is solicitous to an embarrassing degree. He believes 'every problem has a solution' and sets about reorganising Michel's life with advice and manipulative acts. Because Michel and Claire don't present a united front, he's able to become a murderous cuckoo in their nest. </p> <p>As with Hitchcock and Fritz Lang, there's a deadly logic in the way one act leads plausibly to another on the escalator of will and desire, and with considerable subtlety Moll draws us into Harry's scheming mind. In the way he coolly thinks the unthinkable, Harry is as insidious and seductive as Patricia Highsmith's psychopathic Tom Ripley. </p> <p> Harry, He's Here to Help is superbly performed by its central quartet, and by the actors playing Michel's somewhat disagreeable parents and his louche brother. A profoundly disturbing work, it's the best European movie in a Hitchcockian vein since George Sluizer's The Vanishing and is made with a confident grace and ironic wit. It also has one of the best mobile phone jokes, which will remind many viewers of a famous scene involving a corpse in Frenzy. </p> <p>Two other motifs that Conrad's book draws attention to turn up in the film. Hitchcock found eggs abhorrent, but Harry eats them raw to improve his orgasms and Michel, when he resumes writing, produces a story called 'Les Oeufs'. Hitch also had a thing about teeth and Henry Fonda's troubles in The Wrong Man begin with his dental bills. The bridge Harry needed as a schoolboy after a sporting collision with Michel was fitted by Michel's father and had to be replaced in America after turning black.</p>",

In the men's lavatory at a motorway caf\u00e9, a good-looking, slightly flashy man introduces himself to Michel as an old friend he's not met for 20 years and who remembers their schooldays in astonishing detail. This stranger by a drain is called Harry Balestrero (Sergi Lopez), a name designed to set off alarm bells in the viewer's mind. Balestrero is the name of the innocent victim in The Wrong Man; Harry is the corpse that causes trouble in Vermont in Hitchcock's most extended exercise in rural mayhem in The Trouble With Harry. Harry, like Bruno in Strangers on a Train, is idle, aesthetically poised and independently wealthy, having inherited large sums from a despised father. Accompanied by his simple, sexy, patronised girlfriend (Sophie Guillemin), he insinuates himself into the lives of Michel, Claire and their children, sensing faultlines in their relationships and creating new ones. It begins with lollies for the kids, a lift in his air-conditioned Mercedes and a flattering concern for Michel having given up on the literary career that seemed to lie before him as a precocious schoolboy. Harry's one of those people who knows more about you than you know yourself and is solicitous to an embarrassing degree. He believes 'every problem has a solution' and sets about reorganising Michel's life with advice and manipulative acts. Because Michel and Claire don't present a united front, he's able to become a murderous cuckoo in their nest. As with Hitchcock and Fritz Lang, there's a deadly logic in the way one act leads plausibly to another on the escalator of will and desire, and with considerable subtlety Moll draws us into Harry's scheming mind. In the way he coolly thinks the unthinkable, Harry is as insidious and seductive as Patricia Highsmith's psychopathic Tom Ripley. Harry, He's Here to Help is superbly performed by its central quartet, and by the actors playing Michel's somewhat disagreeable parents and his louche brother. A profoundly disturbing work, it's the best European movie in a Hitchcockian vein since George Sluizer's The Vanishing and is made with a confident grace and ironic wit. It also has one of the best mobile phone jokes, which will remind many viewers of a famous scene involving a corpse in Frenzy. Two other motifs that Conrad's book draws attention to turn up in the film. Hitchcock found eggs abhorrent, but Harry eats them raw to improve his orgasms and Michel, when he resumes writing, produces a story called 'Les Oeufs'. Hitch also had a thing about teeth and Henry Fonda's troubles in The Wrong Man begin with his dental bills. The bridge Harry needed as a schoolboy after a sporting collision with Michel was fitted by Michel's father and had to be replaced in America after turning black.",

      "body": "<p>When I saw two poems by Ted Hughes on the front of the Times in January 1998, I was as surprised as any other reader. These were trailers from Birthday Letters, a cycle of poems addressed to his long dead first wife, Sylvia Plath. Irrespective of the poems' literary merit (and they were very fine), their publication was a sensation, an unexpected finale to an infamous romantic tragedy. </p> <p>There was another reason for my surprise. One of the poems, 'St Botolph's', an account of the first, intense encounter between Hughes and Plath, was dense with astrological imagery, impenetrable to anyone unversed in deciphering a horoscope. 'The conjunction combust my natal Sun/ Venus pinned exact on my midheaven,' it chattered, commenting on the planetary positions that attended that fateful meeting, before concluding, remarkably, that the two poets had that night been 'married by the solar system'. Other poems in Birthday Letters - 'Horoscope', '18 Rugby Street' - likewise suggested that a writer celebrated principally for his nature poetry had an unsuspected life as a star-gazer. The poet laureate had outed himself as an astrologer! </p> <p>As much was confirmed by Hughes's publishers, Faber and Faber, who informed me that Hughes always stipulated the exact publication dates of his books. Birthday Letters, it turned out, was published on the day of a new moon, 29 January 1998. Its US edition followed on the next new moon. </p> <p>What would the literary establishment make of Ted the planeteer? Disappointingly little, it transpired. Out of embarrassment or indifference, the critics avoided comment on the astrological references. There was the odd remark about the poet's 'dottier beliefs', and Seamus Heaney described Hughes and Plath as 'mythopoetic' writers, but otherwise nothing. Ariel's Gift, a 'comprehensive guide' to Birthday Letters by Times critic Erica Wagner, managed to avoid addressing astrology anywhere in its 200 pages. </p> <p>I was not altogether surprised. Astrology, for all the popularity of newspaper sun sign horoscopes, remains beyond respectability, the province of the potty. Look at the derision heaped on Ronald Reagan and Princess Diana when their consultations with astrologers became public knowledge. The case of Hughes and Birthday Letters is a paradigm of the way astrology and kindred 'irrationalist' systems help shape culture while going unacknowledged or belittled. </p> <p>Over the last century, astrology has seeped into poetry, music, film, psychology and even science, and enchanted titans such as Yeats and Jung, yet it remains a renegade and ridiculed subject. Remarking on Yeats's passion for esoteric ideas, W.H. Auden wondered: 'How on earth could a man of Yeats's gifts take such nonsense seriously?' His question can as justly be inverted; if a man of Yeats's gifts took this nonsense seriously, maybe it has something to tell us. It is a delicious irony that Yeats is the favourite poet of astrology's fiercest and most eminent critic, Richard Dawkins, whose last book, Unweaving the Rainbow, included a thunderous attack on Keats, Blake, Yeats and other poets of genius for their lack of scientific rigour and 'prejudice against reason'. Dawkins certainly knows about prejudice. For him, astrology is a wicked fraud, 'an aesthetic affront' whose 'pre-Copernican dabblings demean and cheapen astronomy'. Astrologers, whom he 'detests', should be prosecuted. 'We should learn to see the debauching of science for profit as a crime,' rasps Dawkins, transformed from Beacon of Reason to Chief of Thought Police. </p> <p>The scientific model of the universe upheld by Dawkins does, indeed, present astrologers with a problem. There is simply no known mechanism which might link human character and behaviour to the movement of planets and the position of stars, though the 'holographic universe' posited by quantum physicist David Bohm, an associate of Einstein, offers one explanation of how such a link might function. </p> <p>Such objective proof as exists to support the astrologers' age-old adage 'as above, so below' is patchy and contested. The exhaustive research of French statistician Michael Gauquelin, who found, for example, a powerful correlation between sports champions and the position of Mars in their birth charts, remains the subject of bitter disputes. Here, the prevailing scientific attitude to Gauquelin's findings was summed up by psychologist Hans Eysenck as: 'Don't confuse me with facts when my mind is made up.' </p> <p>Proof, however, comes in many shapes, not least in the guise of personal experience. Symbols are, in their way, just as 'real' (a favourite Dawkins adjective) as the constructs of hardhat science. Symbolism challenges consciousness and nourishes imagination, inviting us to uncover deeper levels of meaning. Astrology's richly symbolic language, resonating with the myths of the ancients, is a major part of its appeal, not least for artists and others seeking to understand what Jung termed the 'archetypes' of the human psyche. </p> <p>Among poets, it occurs in the work of Ted Hughes, Louis MacNeice (who wrote a book on astrology), and Rudyard Kipling (who perhaps learnt something of it through his freemasonry). Then there is Yeats himself, whose most famous poem, 'The Second Coming', has part of its genesis in the astrological concept of the 'great ages'. I suspect Yeats's 'rough beast, slouching towards Bethlehem to be born' was in part his 'new age', a version of 'the Age of Aquarius' which had become a fashionable catchphrase in astrological circles at the time he wrote the poem. </p> <p>While Yeats was writing 'The Second Coming', Gustav Holst was composing The Planets . Holst based his masterpiece on the astrological meanings of the heavenly bodies, though he kept this concealed at the time, no doubt mindful that the astrologer on whose work his suite was modelled, Alan Leo, had recently been prosecuted for 'fortune-telling'. </p> <p>Later musicians felt able to express their interests more openly. Jazz colossus John Coltrane wrote several works with astrological themes late in his life, among them 'Saturn', 'Jupiter', 'Venus' and 'Leo', and according to his widow, Alice, used a scheme 'with 12 tones correlating to the 12 zodiac signs'. Pop music is littered with cosmic references, whether you want to 'Breakfast on Pluto' with Sinatra or were 'Born Under a Bad Sign' with Albert King. </p> <p>More surprising was the realisation that the century's most celebrated love story, Gone With the Wind, is a thinly disguised astrological allegory. Margaret Mitchell based the characters of her torrid epic on the zodiac, leaving a blatant trail of clues which were only picked up in 1978 when US astrologer Darrell Martinie was shown photocopies of notes from Mitchell's library. </p> <p>Scarlett O'Hara proves to be a dashing Aries, named after the colour of her ruling planet Mars. Her father is a Taurus who owns a farm in earthy Taurean fashion, the Tara plantation. Scarlett's twittering aunts, Prissy and Pitty Pat, are a pair of Geminis whose names comply with the sign's love of wordplay. Rhett Butler is a passionate Leo. Bonnie is the third fire sign, Sagittarius. Being born under the sign of the centaur, she meets her end in a horse-riding accident. The list goes on ...</p> <p>In the Harry Potter books, our hero is reluctantly learning star lore from cranky professor of divination, Sybill Trelawney, and this turns out to be a refreshingly accurate reflection of real-life astrology. Is Joanna Rowling another secret stargazer? </p> <p>Such outcrops of influence in popular and high culture alike testify to astrology's vigorous, unruly character. Having survived the edicts of emperors and popes, it is not surprising that it continues to defy scientific rationalism today. Accordingly, it comes in many guises; as newspaper horoscopes, as psychology, as agony aunt, as adviser to the rich and powerful. Charles de Gaulle, seemingly a model of the man of will, is the latest president to be named as taking astro-advice ,though contrary to popular legend, Adolf Hitler was uninterested in the subject. </p> <p>If science and astronomy really do want to win popular respect, as their champions claim, they might begin by admitting astrology's role in their own history. Instead, science airbrushes out the interests of astronomical pioneers like Johannes Kepler, who wrote exten sively on the links between numbers, music and astrology, and whose ideas on reforming astrology reveal an approach strikingly akin to that of modern astrologers, disliking predictions and favouring character analysis. </p> <p>Galileo, hailed as the first man of modern astronomy, had a lifelong interest in astrology, and even science's most potent figurehead, Sir Isaac Newton, while no astrologer, was a closet alchemist. Robert Boyle, one of the founding fathers of modern chemistry, was also fascinated by alchemy. </p> <p>Astrology has flourished in recent decades partly because it offers an escape from a cold, purposeless cosmos into a universe charged with symbolic meaning and individual significance.

Saul Bellow (born 1915, Nobel Laureate 1976, triumphant producer of both a novel and a child this year) was bound to seem a rich prospect to a biographer whose parents came from the northwest-side Jewish Chicago milieu that was Bellow's human material ('he was experience-near'). </p> <p>Atlas has aspired to the unslavish penetration of Boswell on Johnson, Ellmann on Joyce, biographies 'imbued with profound sympathy for their subjects' foibles and failings - imbued, to put it plainly, with love'. </p> <p>The resulting book, though, without quite being a blot on the biographer's art, makes a mockery of that high intention. If anything can be said to imbue it, it is an admiration mysteriously shot through with rancour. </p> <p>Saul Bellow, like any biographical subject, has feet of clay, knees of clay, hips of clay, but there is an incongruous element of resentment in Atlas's recording of his flaws. Balanced literary judgments alternate with a sort of character assassination by degrees. </p> <p>Bellow's third novel, The Adventures of Augie March (1953), is recognised as having brought a particular appetitious vitality into American fiction. That vitality could be claimed as distinctively Jewish in its earthy sublimity, but Bellow was no more in a hurry to be defined than his hero. </p> <p>This was a founding father who refused to become an institution: his preferred formulation was (to quote the title of one of his talks) 'Americans Who Are Also Jews'. It argues against a narrow agenda that his novels should have for their protagonists (as Philip Roth has pointed out) physically large and confident Wasps and smaller, less forceful Jews, more or less in alternation, much as Alfred Hitchcock cast assured Cary Grant and vulnerable James Stewart in roles that represented different intensities of wish-fulfilment. </p> <p>Bellow's private life is spectacularly messy, with four failed marriages, three compromised relationships with sons, periods of cranky therapy and plentiful adulteries. A fair-sized volume could be compiled exclusively from his vengeful fictional versions of ex-wives. His most successful book commercially, Herzog (1964), based on his third wife's affair with his best friend, had the grace to include his self-portrait in the satire.</p> <p>Atlas has a simple explanation for his subject's failures as a husband: the early death of Bellow's mother, before he had achieved independence from her, prevented him from forging mature relationships. This is a peculiarly reductive analysis, quite apart from the fact that the death of a boy's parent when he's 17 doesn't exactly qualify as childhood trauma. </p> <p>It requires that Bellow learn absolutely nothing from his entanglements, until things go mysteriously right with Janis Freedman, whom he married in 1989. The other part of the picture is that Bellow was driven to such prodigies of literary effort by the need to prove himself to his worldly elder brothers. </p> <p>In his acknowledgements, Atlas thanks his assistant, Adam Kirsh, for having 'laboured to make my somewhat impressionistic citations credible'. 'Impressionistic' in a biography sits next to 'citations' as comfortably as 'juggling' next to 'nitroglycerine'. And if this is after the labour, it's hard to imagine before - how much labour would it take to check if T. S. Eliot really described himself as a Roman Catholic?</p> <p>It's often hard to tell how far Atlas is paraphrasing someone's opinion, and how far he is drowning it out with his own: 'To Adam Bellow [son of the second wife], Janis Freedman was the last in a succession of mother figures, the legacy of his father's overly dependent relationship with a mother who died before he achieved independence from her. \"My father needed to be taken care of,\" said Adam - and that need accounted for his many marriages.' Without a reference of any kind, it's impossible to verify if Adam Bellow said more than the eight quoted words (or even those) - unsurprising testimony from a man whose father has married at the age of 74. </p> <p>Bellow's 1970 novel Mr Sammler's Planet (or 'dramatic essay,' as he once described it) marked a turning point. By opting for a hero older than himself, a Holocaust survivor, he treated the culture of the 1960s as a problem in itself, rather than engaging with the issues that bedevilled the decade. His sense of grievance remained constant - he seems to have needed to feel embattled - but he metamorphosed from an unpredictable radical (once a Trotskyite) into an entrenched conservative. His hostility to the spread of free love was perhaps puzzling in someone who had so long claimed that privilege for himself. </p> <p>Early and late he mined other people's lives for material, from Augie March (where he borrowed from a Saturday Evening Post article about training eagles in Mexico) to Ravelstein, published this year, whose hero was closely modelled on Bellow's flamboyant friend and colleague Allan Bloom. Atlas has some damaging points to make about this practice: when Bellow dramatised two notorious Chicago crimes for The Dean's December, they merely became part of his cultural indictment, and he came close to blaming the victim in each case. </p> <p>Atlas has objections to the general legitimacy of appropriating the lives of others (oddly, since so much of his own book is devoted to tracing the originals of portraits). He quotes in full a 1974 letter of Bellow's to Dave Peltz, an old friend from whose experiences he had lifted an incident for Humboldt's Gift, and describes its 'condescension' and 'total lack of empathy'. </p> <p>In fact, there is something magnificent about what is almost a literary credo: 'The name of the game is Give All. You are welcome to all my facts. You know them, I give them to you. If you have the strength to pick them up, take them with my blessing. Touch them with your imagination and I will kiss your hands.' </p> <p>How else is an artist to attempt the portrait of his neighbourhood and his age?

Not 'big' simply in the sense of 'a big voice that belts them out', but big because she was a transcendent and versatile performer. </p> <p>Her latest biographer, Gerald Clarke, reminds us of the words of James Mason, Garland's funeral eulogist in 1969 and her co-star in A Star is Born. Mason said at the graveside that posterity did not remember entertainers, but Clarke disagrees. Garland is still everywhere, he argues, and he is probably right. While some of the sordid details have been blurred, her voice has permanently informed the idea of how a popular song should be sung. </p> <p>Back in 1951, when she arrived in Plymouth by boat for one of her first 'comeback' dates at the London Palladium, her British fans were aware of the support she would require. Thousands of them turned up to welcome her, Clarke tells us, while all the ships in the harbour spelled out her name in nautical signals. </p> <p>And the singer really did need her public. She had no inner resources at all. Her ambitious mother, Ethel Gumm, had fed her youngest daughter Frances, or Baby, on pep pills from the age of 10 - the gruelling studio schedule demanded it. The MGM starlet grew up in front of the cameras, taking school lessons with Deanna Durbin on the lot in between takes for the series of teen movies she was making with Mickey Rooney. </p> <p>By the time she was a young woman, Garland had learned to judge herself by the harsh standards of screen beauty. Like her daughter, she always had trouble believing she was attractive. David Shipman's earlier biography of the star, Garland, has the producer Joseph Pasternak comment tellingly: 'She wanted to be Lana Turner and it didn't occur to her that Lana Turner might have liked to be Judy Garland.' </p> <p>In spite of this insecurity, or perhaps because of it, Garland married five times and had many affairs. She felt complete, she said, only when she was in love, yet her titanic emotional demands exhausted all-comers. 'She lives in four dimensions,' complained one boyfriend. Garland also tended to choose men who were bisexual, if not actually gay. Possibly it was a na\u00efve search for the kind of sanitised romance that her musicals portrayed. </p> <p>The most glamorous of these lovers was the darkly beautiful matin\u00e9e idol Tyrone Power. Clarke has more information on this affair than previous biographers and describes how their intense passion faltered only when Power signed up for military service. Like Garland's later marriage to Liza's father, film director Vincente Minnelli, the relationship was marred by Power's attraction to men. </p> <p>The enduring male figures in Garland's life were altogether more macho. The early death of her father, Frank Gumm, had thrown a long shadow, and although he had been secretly homosexual too, for Garland tough guys such as the producers Sidney Luft and Joseph L. Mankiewicz seemed to be cast in his capable mould. A recent book by Lorna Luft, Garland's daughter by the producer, has claimed that he was the only man her mother ever truly loved, but here Clarke decides to stick to an older story. According to him, it was the married and charismatic Mankiewicz of whom Garland continued to dream whenever she sang the Gershwin/Arlen ballad 'The Man That Got Away'. </p> <p>The fall into barbiturate and amphetamine dependency was quick. She managed to abstain during pregnancy in 1946, and two years later, while working on The Good Old Summertime - in which the baby Liza makes a first screen appearance - Garland responded well to the tender care of cast and crew. As a result, the film confounded expectations and came in on time. But by now the star's hair had started to fall out and she was unceremoniously dropped from Annie Get Your Gun.</p> <p>At this point, MGM actually administered electric shocks to try to arrest the eclipse of one of their brightest stars. As the film roles dried up, Garland ricocheted from one 'caretaker' to another. Even her elder daughter was pushed into this role. Clarke notes that Liza was the only little girl in Hollywood with her own stomach pump. More than once, she saved her mother's life with it. </p> <p>The title of this biography is taken from Garland's memorable screen number, 'Get Happy', one of the original 'let's do the show right here!' routines from Summer Stock, in which she starred with Gene Kelly and Phil Silvers. It turns out that this great celluloid moment, now central to the Garland cult, nearly didn't happen. Filming was postponed at the last minute because the star was incapable. Unexpectedly, though, Garland dragged herself to the set on time the next morning and her performance earned her an immortal place as a kitsch siren of the screen. </p> <p>For Clarke, Garland is a genius, but a genius who, for most of her life, knew she was an addict. He tells us that as a child, Liza had secretly studied her mother's extraordinary singing technique by watching from the top of the stairs as she entertained at parties. Sadly, the daughter seems to have picked up more than performance tips.

      "body": "<p><strong>Promises, Promises: Essays on Literature and Psychoanalysis</strong><br>Adam Phillips<br>Faber \u00a310, pp240</p> <p>It seems only five minutes since Adam Phillips published his last book: there's no stopping him. Promises, Promises is a collection of reviews, essays and lectures, but if it looks more mixed and patched than some earlier books, then that's part of the point.</p> <p>Promises, Promises relishes the miscellaneous; characteristically, and appealingly, it avoids dogma, certitudes and authority. But it does have a strong and absorbing theme, which is the relation of psychoanalysis and literature. Which is better? Or, which is better for you? What are their languages good for? And, what good might they do you? 'Words alone are certain good,' Phillips quotes Yeats. But whose words and what is 'certain good'? The words good, better, best run through this book like a plot, or an obsession. </p> <p>Psychoanalysis, though it is a science, often uses or invokes literature, especially poetry. Why? Because psychoanalysis has to work in and with language, and the language of poetry demonstrates the 'best' possibilities of language, and thereby sustains confidence in the value of words. But there may also be unease and ambiguity in this relationship, and Phillips explores this with interest, care, and considerable scepticism. </p> <p>(He spends his own writing life in a balancing act between the two. Some of his heroes - Jonathan Lear, Leslie Farber, Lacan, Winnicott - are analysts, but you often feel he would rather be reading T.S. Eliot, John Clare or Hart Crane. As he says at the end of this book: 'Why have an analysis when you can read?') </p> <p>As if putting his dual allegiance to the test, he asks, are psychoanalysis and literature in competition, or collaboration? You could describe the analyst as a kind of poet.

      "bodyText": "Promises, Promises: Essays on Literature and Psychoanalysis Adam Phillips Faber \u00a310, pp240 It seems only five minutes since Adam Phillips published his last book: there's no stopping him. Promises, Promises is a collection of reviews, essays and lectures, but if it looks more mixed and patched than some earlier books, then that's part of the point. Promises, Promises relishes the miscellaneous; characteristically, and appealingly, it avoids dogma, certitudes and authority. But it does have a strong and absorbing theme, which is the relation of psychoanalysis and literature. Which is better? Or, which is better for you? What are their languages good for? And, what good might they do you? 'Words alone are certain good,' Phillips quotes Yeats. But whose words and what is 'certain good'? The words good, better, best run through this book like a plot, or an obsession. Psychoanalysis, though it is a science, often uses or invokes literature, especially poetry. Why? Because psychoanalysis has to work in and with language, and the language of poetry demonstrates the 'best' possibilities of language, and thereby sustains confidence in the value of words. But there may also be unease and ambiguity in this relationship, and Phillips explores this with interest, care, and considerable scepticism. (He spends his own writing life in a balancing act between the two. Some of his heroes - Jonathan Lear, Leslie Farber, Lacan, Winnicott - are analysts, but you often feel he would rather be reading T.S. Eliot, John Clare or Hart Crane. As he says at the end of this book: 'Why have an analysis when you can read?') As if putting his dual allegiance to the test, he asks, are psychoanalysis and literature in competition, or collaboration? You could describe the analyst as a kind of poet. When he (though Phillips often uses 'she') makes a 'good interpretation' of the patient's material, he changes the punctuation and the form: 'The patient's sonnets are turned into free verse, his limericks are turned into elegies.' Or you could say that the analyst turns the patient into a better writer, the 'good-enough poet of his own life'. (But then, how does the analyst arrive at his sense of 'what a good life for a person is'? 'How do we know what is good for ourselves and someone else?') Or you could see psychoanalysis in rivalry with the poets. For Freud, creative writers are, enviably, the ones who get away with it, who can make their shameful desires acceptable in public.

Urged by his mother, he wrote about these things, in short stories that were published in a multitude of literary magazines, including Esquire.

Seven hundred years of language, distilled into its sharpest and brightest forms, are here to be discovered. The poems, like jewels, have to be reset for new admiration. </p> <p>The reader is very much at the centre of Paul Keegan's enterprise. He has chosen to arrange the poems not by date of composition, or by the order of their authors' births, but as they were first published in volume form. As Keegan points out in his preface, his method of structuring an anthology makes quite a difference to how we view the poems. What a year 1819 was for the reader, for instance. He or she might first have encountered Scott's The Bride of Lammermoor, Keats's The Eve of St Agnes, the first Canto of Byron's Don Juan, Shelley's The Mask of Anarchy or Blake's To the Accuser Who is the God of This World. A reader in 1611 might have looked into Chapman's Homer for the first time, as well as the Authorised Version of the Bible.</p> <p>Keegan's decision on chronology is justified by the vibrancy of communication between one poem or the next. It is fascinating, for example, that two poems that make such deep but different appeals to public emotion as Kipling's 'Recessional' and Wilde's 'The Ballad of Reading Gaol' were published within a year of each other, and are set side by side in this anthology.</p> <p>Kipling and Wilde, strangers in many things, share a confident sense of audience which today's poets can only wonder at, and perhaps envy. Both poets believe in their hold on the public, and that poetry must use this hold to enlighten and instruct. 'By each let this be heard,' urges Wilde, as he forces his readers to contemplate their own kinship with the condemned man in prison. Kipling, too, warns against insular complacency as he addresses the British Empire at its zenith: </p> <p> Far called, our navies melt away; </p> <p>On dune and headland sinks the fire: </p> <p>Lo, all our pomp of yesterday </p> <p>Is one with Ninevah and Tyre! </p> <p> Again and again, the reader comes across such thoughtful, thought-provoking juxtapositions of poems. </p> <p>Keegan's respect for the contemporary reader's experience of these poems as they were published has also led him to leave spelling and punctuation unmodernised. The risk that this may make some poems more difficult is balanced by the gain of a certain frisson of strangeness, as the rind of familiarity is stripped away: </p> <p> They fle from me that sometyme did me seke </p> <p>With naked fote stalking in my chambre. </p> <p>I have seen theim gentill tame and meke </p> <p>That nowe are wyld and do not remembre </p> <p>That sometyme they put theimself in daunger </p> <p>To take bred at my hand... </p> <p>(Sir Thomas Wyatt) </p> <p> Such a well-known poem can only gain from this slight linguistic estrangement. The royal court Wyatt describes here is no haven of trundling Germanic protocol, but the court of Henry VIII, foreign by more than four centuries, a place of danger, rumour and execution. </p> <p>Keegan follows tradition in calling this a book of verse, rather than a book of poetry. Hymns, carols, street cries, epitaphs, ballads, adages, nonsense verse and rhymes thicken the brew. The plangent, poignant voice of Anonymous is among the strongest. Here again, Keegan's emphasis on chronology comes into its own. It's easier to appreciate the influence of the traditional ballad on Coleridge, for instance, when 'Dejection, An Ode' faces 'The Wife of Usher's Well', which was published the same year in Scott's edition of Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border. </p> <p>The delight of any poetry anthology lies not only in finding new facets to well-known poems, but also in being introduced to less familiar work. John Davidson's 'Thirty Bob a Week' describes the grind of a clerk's life in the 1890s. At first it seems conventional enough in its touching detail, but then the voice grows stronger. Suddenly the poem takes fire from the defiant sweep of this clerk's imagination, and his claim for justice: </p> <p> It's a naked child against a hungry wolf; </p> <p>It's playing bowls upon a splitting wreck; </p> <p>It's walking on a string across a gulf </p> <p>With the millstones fore-and-aft about your neck; </p> <p>But the thing is daily done by many and many a one; </p> <p>And we fall, face forward, fighting, on the deck. </p> <p> When it comes to the twentieth century, Keegan makes clear that his coverage is not inclusive. Poets born later than the outset of the 1950s do not qualify. This seems reasonable, bearing in mind that the poems and the reputations of younger poets are still very much in the making.</p> <p>But there are other exclusions which are more surprising and more questionable. Keegan devotes 279 pages, out of 1,100-odd, to twentieth-century poetry. Fewer than 30 poems by women feature on these pages, and none is a long poem. There is nothing by Fleur Adcock, U. A. Fanthorpe, Liz Lochhead, Selima Hill, E. J. Scovell, Elizabeth Jennings, Wendy Cope, Gillian Clarke, Anne Stevenson, Carol Rumens, Ruth Padel, Pauline Stainer, Kathleen Raine, Patricia Beer, Elaine Feinstein, Ruth Fainlight, Vicki Feaver, Penelope Shuttle, Gillian Allnut; many other fine women poets born well before 1950 come to mind. You will not find Jenny Joseph's 'Warning' here; it has been much anthologised, it's true, but surely no more than Heaney's 'Personal Helicon', which is included. </p> <p>All this is such a loss to the reader.

It's an opening that's textbook attention-grabbing, but also one to cause a sigh of anxiety that the reader's in for a heavy dose of whimsical, magic-realist adventures.</p> <p>In this case, however, such anxiety proves profoundly misplaced. Moses Isegawa's opening does set the tone for some of what's to follow: the unfamiliar quirks of a country full of snakes, crocodiles and scorpions and a culture combining tribal traditions and superstitions with fanatical Catholicism, Protestantism, despotism and Islam. But it can't begin to hint at the scope and ambition of his bewitching bildungsroman, set in Uganda over the past 30 years. </p> <p>In the tradition of Tristram Shandy, Isegawa's narrator, Mugezi, has no hesitation in offering intensely detailed descriptions of incidents that precede his own existence. He describes the childhood of his father, Serenity, who was the son of the local clan chief and a mother who ran off with a shopkeeper. Serenity's faith in women remains extremely shaky until the day he learns that the blushing ex-nun he has picked as a bride has, after 'nine consecutive novenas to St Jude Thaddeus' agreed to go ahead and marry him. </p> <p>Mugezi's account of his parents' wedding is extremely funny, packed with layer upon layer of vivid detail: the virgin bride's prudish horror at the deeply suggestive pelvic gyrations of the dancers; the near-disastrous wedding night, in which Serenity finds that erections 'seemed to be manufactured in a factory far away', but is baled out by the helpful interventions of a bridal aunt who subsequently becomes his mistress; the rivers of vomit and diarrhoea flooding the village after the wedding feast. It's all done in a verbose, polysyllabic style, teeming with colourful and at times far-fetched similes and metaphors, but is rescued from pomp by a gentle, pervasive irony and regular disarming doses of the abruptly colloquial and down-to-earth. </p> <p>In this vein, Mugezi spends his early years 'in the baby business' with his great-aunt 'as a midwife's mascot-cum-assistant'. Following her death in a fire at just the time Idi Amin seizes power, he joins his parents at their bungalow in the city and finds that he has 'become the family shitman. Every morning,' he confides, 'my olefactory glands were bombarded with a string of scatological blasts, my eyes smothered with scatalogical disasters in different gradations of colour and sordidity.' His mother, whose nickname appears to have switched from Virgin to Padlock, delegates all the washing, wiping and nappy-laundering to her eldest son. For the rest of the book, Mugezi refers to his siblings only as 'the shitters'. </p> <p>Mugezi's excremental duties are an apt metaphor for the punishing regime in which he finds himself trapped. Padlock proves more power-crazed than any dictator, forcing Mugezi to kneel before her for hours on end and rewarding every minor and imagined misdemeanour with savage thrashings. Serenity colludes in the despotism, only rarely emerging from his silent communion with Dickens or Waiting for Godot to add his own words of chastisement.</p> <p>When his childhood fantasy comes true, and the nation's shopkeepers, indeed all Indians, are expelled by Amin, he wins his bet that the West won't intervene. All are delighted that these agents of British colonial oppression have been forced out. As Mugezi struggles to survive the parental dictatorship, he finds his admiration for Amin swelling by the day. 'Amin had exhorted every citizen to walk tall, to act proud and not to let anyone deny them their rights, their dignity or their self-worth.' </p> <p>Mugezi eventually engineers his own expulsion from the family home and into another dictatorial regime, that of a Catholic seminary. Here he discovers the age-old cycle of bullying, how the victims become the perpetrators. He is mesmerised by the power machinations of a rich, white European priest and adept at making his own Machiavellian manoeuvres in order to prosper and survive. </p> <p>As Uganda lurches into the horrific aftermath of the Amin regime, he realises that he had 'dammed his disgust' with the reality of the political situation 'just to keep fighting in my corner'. Mugezi finds his grandfather's maimed body on a street corner, hears that his Aunt Kasawo has been gang-raped and witnesses his Aunt Lwandeka's excruciating, lingering death from Aids. Wrung out by the sufferings of his country, he flees to Amsterdam and embarks on a whole new life as a black man in the land of the colonisers. </p> <p>Abyssinian Chronicles is, in every sense, a big book, exploding with big themes and a rich cast of colourful characters. Giles Foden's superb 1998 novel The Last King of Scotland offered a convincing glimpse of Amin's torturous regime, but Isegawa's work suggests a passionate immersion in his country's history that few Europeans could match.

      "bodyText": "Abyssinian Chronicles Moses Isegawa Picador \u00a316, pp462 Buy it at BOL Not many novels begin with the narrator's father disappearing into the jaws of a crocodile. It's an opening that's textbook attention-grabbing, but also one to cause a sigh of anxiety that the reader's in for a heavy dose of whimsical, magic-realist adventures. In this case, however, such anxiety proves profoundly misplaced. Moses Isegawa's opening does set the tone for some of what's to follow: the unfamiliar quirks of a country full of snakes, crocodiles and scorpions and a culture combining tribal traditions and superstitions with fanatical Catholicism, Protestantism, despotism and Islam. But it can't begin to hint at the scope and ambition of his bewitching bildungsroman, set in Uganda over the past 30 years. In the tradition of Tristram Shandy, Isegawa's narrator, Mugezi, has no hesitation in offering intensely detailed descriptions of incidents that precede his own existence. He describes the childhood of his father, Serenity, who was the son of the local clan chief and a mother who ran off with a shopkeeper. Serenity's faith in women remains extremely shaky until the day he learns that the blushing ex-nun he has picked as a bride has, after 'nine consecutive novenas to St Jude Thaddeus' agreed to go ahead and marry him. Mugezi's account of his parents' wedding is extremely funny, packed with layer upon layer of vivid detail: the virgin bride's prudish horror at the deeply suggestive pelvic gyrations of the dancers; the near-disastrous wedding night, in which Serenity finds that erections 'seemed to be manufactured in a factory far away', but is baled out by the helpful interventions of a bridal aunt who subsequently becomes his mistress; the rivers of vomit and diarrhoea flooding the village after the wedding feast. It's all done in a verbose, polysyllabic style, teeming with colourful and at times far-fetched similes and metaphors, but is rescued from pomp by a gentle, pervasive irony and regular disarming doses of the abruptly colloquial and down-to-earth. In this vein, Mugezi spends his early years 'in the baby business' with his great-aunt 'as a midwife's mascot-cum-assistant'. Following her death in a fire at just the time Idi Amin seizes power, he joins his parents at their bungalow in the city and finds that he has 'become the family shitman. Every morning,' he confides, 'my olefactory glands were bombarded with a string of scatological blasts, my eyes smothered with scatalogical disasters in different gradations of colour and sordidity.' His mother, whose nickname appears to have switched from Virgin to Padlock, delegates all the washing, wiping and nappy-laundering to her eldest son. For the rest of the book, Mugezi refers to his siblings only as 'the shitters'. Mugezi's excremental duties are an apt metaphor for the punishing regime in which he finds himself trapped. Padlock proves more power-crazed than any dictator, forcing Mugezi to kneel before her for hours on end and rewarding every minor and imagined misdemeanour with savage thrashings. Serenity colludes in the despotism, only rarely emerging from his silent communion with Dickens or Waiting for Godot to add his own words of chastisement. When his childhood fantasy comes true, and the nation's shopkeepers, indeed all Indians, are expelled by Amin, he wins his bet that the West won't intervene. All are delighted that these agents of British colonial oppression have been forced out. As Mugezi struggles to survive the parental dictatorship, he finds his admiration for Amin swelling by the day. 'Amin had exhorted every citizen to walk tall, to act proud and not to let anyone deny them their rights, their dignity or their self-worth.' Mugezi eventually engineers his own expulsion from the family home and into another dictatorial regime, that of a Catholic seminary. Here he discovers the age-old cycle of bullying, how the victims become the perpetrators. He is mesmerised by the power machinations of a rich, white European priest and adept at making his own Machiavellian manoeuvres in order to prosper and survive. As Uganda lurches into the horrific aftermath of the Amin regime, he realises that he had 'dammed his disgust' with the reality of the political situation 'just to keep fighting in my corner'. Mugezi finds his grandfather's maimed body on a street corner, hears that his Aunt Kasawo has been gang-raped and witnesses his Aunt Lwandeka's excruciating, lingering death from Aids. Wrung out by the sufferings of his country, he flees to Amsterdam and embarks on a whole new life as a black man in the land of the colonisers. Abyssinian Chronicles is, in every sense, a big book, exploding with big themes and a rich cast of colourful characters. Giles Foden's superb 1998 novel The Last King of Scotland offered a convincing glimpse of Amin's torturous regime, but Isegawa's work suggests a passionate immersion in his country's history that few Europeans could match. Now living, like his narrator, in Amsterdam, he has clearly been called on to explain to white Europeans at parties the violence, starvation, civil wars and corruption of Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Sudan. This funny, gripping, angry epic is his response, a snapshot of a tiny corner of Africa and its complex history: the impossible legacy of colonial powers who 'had parcelled out Africa among themselves at the Berlin Conference in 1884 without even stepping foot on the continent'. Isegawa's novel is, as some American reviews have pointed out, reminiscent of Rushdie and Marquez. It is also reminiscent of another recent debut, Zadie Smith's White Teeth. Smith famously attacked her own work for self-indulgence and excess, criticisms which could be judiciously applied here. Isegawa does have a tendency to overwrite, use two or three metaphors where one might do and a slightly irritating fondness for certain words and phrases: 'die-hard', 'hydra', 'gobbled virginity' and even 'locusts in the thorax'. He occasionally lapses into clumsiness and some of his rhetorical devices - such as repeating a phrase throughout an entire paragraph - can get a little tedious. These minor flaws do not detract from the vibrancy and power of a spectacular debut, and one which makes a significant contribution to the literature of Africa.",

It must have been hard to endure for such a man that again and again over the years there have been those in Israel who have called him a traitor. </p> <p>Fearless in taking up the cause of Arabs and the Palestinians when he believed they were right, Amos Oz has played a pivotal role in the peace movement. He has cultivated friendships and alliances with writers from 'the other side', although his love of his own country was never in doubt. </p> <p>Like many friends of Israel, and like many Jews and Israelis, I have found the information about the current state of the conflict, particularly as presented on television, to be both confusing and disturbing. And I am aware that coming to Oz as if he were a touchstone could be thought na\u00efve. Political commentators in the Middle East enormously more informed than I am make their judgments on a mass of material and experience which I do not possess. But I have followed the history of Israel for more than 50 years, followed it with admiration. I have ranged over the place, read its writers, spoken about it with those who live there and those living here in the UK who feel connected historically and by kin. This does not earn me an informed opinion but it does, I hope, explain why, like so many others, I feel a need to get to the root of what is happening, to find a way through the clutter. </p> <p>I do not think that 'need' is too dramatic a word. The fate of Israel matters beyond its borders. The country has an infinite attraction for those like myself whose childhood was saturated in Christianity and part of whose adolescence was defined in the battle against it. For Christians, Israel is some sort of home. </p> <p>This I think helps me to understand the passion Israelis have for their land. But this is the rub. Is it theirs? I agree with Amos Oz here when he says that we have a case of two rights - the Palestinians have a right to be there and so do the Israelis. That, Oz hoped, could have been the basis for unity. Instead it has proved the trigger for tragedy. The fundamental point made by Oz in recent weeks is that sooner or later there will be a recognition of these two rights. There are more than five million Israelis and almost three and a half million Palestinians. Neither population is going anywhere and talk of pushing the Israelis into the sea or sending the Palestinians elsewhere is unrealistic madness. </p> <p>As Oz sees, it a line will now be drawn. The attempt, which he worked for, to be 'one happy family' (his phrase) is lost. And as he sees it Arafat is the man to blame for the end of a unity which seemed within sight. </p> <p>There are commentators who believe that the offer made to Arafat was unacceptable. They even say that had he taken it back to the Palestinians he would have been killed. The view of Amos Oz, which I share, is that Israel's Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, went further even than the peace movement dared hope. Barak gave, gritted his teeth, and gave again, testing the democratic support of his constituency beyond any previous limit. Arafat spurned him. </p> <p>It was then that Amos Oz wrote a passionate attack on the Palestinian leader and argued, convincingly I think, that the Israelis could not in real terms at this stage do anything more than Barak had offered. That was the limit and Arafat knew it. </p> <p>Oz still retains an extraordinary roundedness about these confrontations - deploring the casualties, wry about the media's power to organise events here as in other conflicts, keeping his lines open to his friends 'on the other side'. But he has nailed his colours to, ironically once again, an unfashionable mast. </p> <p>It is easy to lash the Israelis. Partly because they seem so impregnable - though the armour without may not reflect the insecurity within, as we know from Freud - and partly because Israel is a democratic society like our own and we are very good at skinning our own. Fundamentalist societies leave us rather baffled and we tend to stand off from them. </p> <p>For years I have regarded Amos Oz as the conscience of Israel. After our talk in the desert I am once again gladly reinforced in that conviction.</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.secretary.state.gov/index.html\">Madeleine Albright's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.p-p-o.com\">Yasser Arafat's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pmo.gov.il/english\">Ehud Barak's office</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.index.gov.il/eng\">Israeli government</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.moledet.org.il/moleng.htm\">Moledet - Land of Israel Loyalty Party (Torah-based religious party)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.iris.org.il/\">Iris - Information Regarding Israel's Security (promoting Israeli security)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/3188/\">Zo Artzeinu (Israeli settlers' group)</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.virtual.co.il/orgs/orgs/ichud/irindex.htm\">Organisation of Rabbis for the People of Israel</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.pna.org\">Palestinian National Authority</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.presidency.gov.eg\">Egyptian presidency</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.palestine-info.net/hamas/index.htm\">Hamas</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>When he was 17 Dennis Malamatinas spent Christmas alone in a strange city. It was 1972 and the teenager had arrived in Chicago from Greece a few months earlier with $300 in his back pocket - cash earned from working on building sites over the previous two years. </p> <p>'My dream was always America. I loved to play basketball. I still do. America to me was a dreamland. I had a problem convincing my parents who at first wouldn't let me go,' Malamatinas says with more than a hint of flamboyance. </p> <p>On his first day in the Windy City, Malamatinas knocked on restaurant doors. Eventually he was taken on as a kitchen hand, starting at 5am. It was the start of a long career in the food and drink industry. Indeed, at the start of this year Malamatinas was still in the restaurant business. Only by then he was the boss of Burger King, having cut his teeth working for the likes of Procter &amp; Gamble, Pepsico and Smirnoff. </p> <p>But sitting by his dormitory bed during the festive season 28 years ago, a lonely Malamatinas was close to throwing in the towel. 'I thought \"what am I doing here?\" I went through a period of about six months when I thought I'd make some money and then just go back. It was depressing - when you're a young kid on your own.' </p> <p>But he hung on and earned enough cash to help fund his way through two university courses, ending up with an MBA from the University of Chicago School of Business. </p> <p>Malamatinas enjoys talking about his humble origins. 'I'm very proud of my background. You name it - I've done it. It makes you a better person - you appreciate people from all walks of life. You get a different perspective.' </p> <p>Malamatinas boasts a truly cosmopolitan background. Born to Greek parents who owned a plantation in Tanzania, he ended up moving back to Greece at a few years old. As well as the US, his work has taken him to Italy, France, Asia and the Soviet Union. Somewhere along the line he lived in Switzerland. As a result Malamatinas speaks four languages and has Greek and Swiss passports. The English accents of his three children vary according to which country they were brought up in. </p> <p>So what nationality is he now? 'I'm Mediterranean, a southern European,' he says in an accent which is a fusion of Greek and Italian. 'I think that's what the world is moving to. The internet is eliminating those barriers, those mental blocks. Who cares what nationality you are?' </p> <p>It is a revealing comment, one which helps explain why Malamatinas, having risen to being Ronald McDonald's public enemy number one, shocked the business world this year by suddenly jacking everything in to launch an internet venture. </p> <p>News that Priceline, the name-your-price internet company, had managed to secure the services of Burger King's head honcho, came as a surreal surprise - even in the weird world of the web. Admittedly, Malamatinas signed up to head Priceline's European operations in March - just before the bubble started to deflate so dramatically ('My timing may not have been that good'. </p> <p>Burger King's owner, Diageo, was in the middle of floating off the company, giving Malamatinas a massive new challenge and a chance to make a global impact. His position had already earned him an audience with the Pope and a job advising Bill Clinton as a founding member of the President's Welfare to Work initiative. And besides, what did he know about the wired world? </p> <p>What he did know about was branding. 'You ask the same questions: What does my brand stand for? What are its core values? What is my creative strategy? How do we communicate with consumers? You build teams - that's what I've done all my life. I understand consumers.' </p> <p>When he took the job, Priceline had a market capitalisation of around $10 billion, having dropped from a high of $17bn. The company was seen as one of the best examples of a dotcom company, a business which used the internet intelligently to bring huge new benefits to consumers. Users would click on the site and have the chance to say just how much they were prepared to pay for things like car rental or air tickets. The more flexible consumers were prepared to be, the greater the savings. Mala matinas, having met the company's founder, Jay Walker, was hooked. </p> <p>'The power of allowing the customer to name their own price is, I think, fantastic. It's unique. It benefits both suppliers and customers. Consumers enjoy significant savings, while the suppliers - the airlines or the car rental companies - regenerate significant revenues.' </p> <p>Today, however, Priceline.com is worth less than $1bn, and many wonder whether its business model is sustainable. Earlier this month the company's chief financial officer, Heidi Miller, resigned. At the same time an investor filed a lawsuit against three of the firm's directors, alleging that they used inside information to sell shares before the company issued a raft of bad news. </p> <p>Priceline Europe, which soft-launched last month but will go on a PR blitz in the new year, is understandably keen to distance itself from the financial shenanigans of its transatlantic sibling. The company is a joint venture, backed by its US namesake and venture capital firm General Atlantic Partners. </p> <p>But the European operation is Malamatinas's baby. He is responsible for the site's launch, its look, everything. This was certainly one of the main attractions of the job. </p> <p>'I've been fascinated by the world of the new economy. The fact is that the internet is here to stay and it's going to fundamentally change our lives. I wanted to be part of that. I didn't want to be a 50-year-old businessman looking back and thinking \"wow, how did I miss this revolution?\".' </p> <p>He says it was the challenge of nurturing a start-up that attracted him when he was approached in March. By then he was already sick of the mad commute between his London home and Burger King's Miami HQ. </p> <p>Having made enough money to ensure he would no longer have to worry about it, Malamatinas, who says he intends to stay with Priceline for 'about five years', felt he could afford a gamble in keeping with his entrepreneurial streak. 'The number one rule in life is to have fun. I'm a self-made man. I didn't have my daddy paying for school. A lot of people joined the new economy to make a fast buck. I don't believe in fast bucks. I've worked hard enough in my life to get where I am.' </p> <p>But 'fun' will not be a byword for dotcom excess. 'There's a lot of bullshit, a lot of hype. People create this myth about the dotcom sector. As far as I'm concerned the same disciplines and processes apply to any business. I dearly want to create a culture which is a nice blend of the old economy and the new: the processes and disciplines of the old economy, but the speed of the new. I'm impatient - I move fast.' </p> <p>Which is no more than you would expect from a burger king.</p>",

You get a different perspective.' Malamatinas boasts a truly cosmopolitan background. Born to Greek parents who owned a plantation in Tanzania, he ended up moving back to Greece at a few years old. As well as the US, his work has taken him to Italy, France, Asia and the Soviet Union. Somewhere along the line he lived in Switzerland. As a result Malamatinas speaks four languages and has Greek and Swiss passports. The English accents of his three children vary according to which country they were brought up in. So what nationality is he now? 'I'm Mediterranean, a southern European,' he says in an accent which is a fusion of Greek and Italian. 'I think that's what the world is moving to. The internet is eliminating those barriers, those mental blocks. Who cares what nationality you are?' It is a revealing comment, one which helps explain why Malamatinas, having risen to being Ronald McDonald's public enemy number one, shocked the business world this year by suddenly jacking everything in to launch an internet venture. News that Priceline, the name-your-price internet company, had managed to secure the services of Burger King's head honcho, came as a surreal surprise - even in the weird world of the web. Admittedly, Malamatinas signed up to head Priceline's European operations in March - just before the bubble started to deflate so dramatically ('My timing may not have been that good'. Burger King's owner, Diageo, was in the middle of floating off the company, giving Malamatinas a massive new challenge and a chance to make a global impact. His position had already earned him an audience with the Pope and a job advising Bill Clinton as a founding member of the President's Welfare to Work initiative. And besides, what did he know about the wired world? What he did know about was branding. 'You ask the same questions: What does my brand stand for? What are its core values? What is my creative strategy? How do we communicate with consumers? You build teams - that's what I've done all my life. I understand consumers.' When he took the job, Priceline had a market capitalisation of around $10 billion, having dropped from a high of $17bn. The company was seen as one of the best examples of a dotcom company, a business which used the internet intelligently to bring huge new benefits to consumers. Users would click on the site and have the chance to say just how much they were prepared to pay for things like car rental or air tickets. The more flexible consumers were prepared to be, the greater the savings. Mala matinas, having met the company's founder, Jay Walker, was hooked. 'The power of allowing the customer to name their own price is, I think, fantastic. It's unique. It benefits both suppliers and customers. Consumers enjoy significant savings, while the suppliers - the airlines or the car rental companies - regenerate significant revenues.' Today, however, Priceline.com is worth less than $1bn, and many wonder whether its business model is sustainable. Earlier this month the company's chief financial officer, Heidi Miller, resigned. At the same time an investor filed a lawsuit against three of the firm's directors, alleging that they used inside information to sell shares before the company issued a raft of bad news. Priceline Europe, which soft-launched last month but will go on a PR blitz in the new year, is understandably keen to distance itself from the financial shenanigans of its transatlantic sibling. The company is a joint venture, backed by its US namesake and venture capital firm General Atlantic Partners. But the European operation is Malamatinas's baby. He is responsible for the site's launch, its look, everything. This was certainly one of the main attractions of the job. 'I've been fascinated by the world of the new economy. The fact is that the internet is here to stay and it's going to fundamentally change our lives. I wanted to be part of that. I didn't want to be a 50-year-old businessman looking back and thinking \"wow, how did I miss this revolution?\".' He says it was the challenge of nurturing a start-up that attracted him when he was approached in March. By then he was already sick of the mad commute between his London home and Burger King's Miami HQ. Having made enough money to ensure he would no longer have to worry about it, Malamatinas, who says he intends to stay with Priceline for 'about five years', felt he could afford a gamble in keeping with his entrepreneurial streak. 'The number one rule in life is to have fun. I'm a self-made man. I didn't have my daddy paying for school. A lot of people joined the new economy to make a fast buck. I don't believe in fast bucks. I've worked hard enough in my life to get where I am.' But 'fun' will not be a byword for dotcom excess. 'There's a lot of bullshit, a lot of hype. People create this myth about the dotcom sector. As far as I'm concerned the same disciplines and processes apply to any business. I dearly want to create a culture which is a nice blend of the old economy and the new: the processes and disciplines of the old economy, but the speed of the new. I'm impatient - I move fast.' Which is no more than you would expect from a burger king.",

      "body": "<p>Daniel, a small-time petty criminal from Kent was drinking in his local pub when he felt a tap on his shoulder. 'I know you, you're a drug dealer,' said a man behind him.</p> <p>Daniel turned and recognised a local police detective: 'He had this stupid smirk on his face,' he said. 'He knew he had me bang to rights, but I didn't know what he wanted. I just denied it and walked away.</p> <p>'A couple of days later he phoned me at home and told me my house was under surveillance from the drug squad and that I was about to be raided. He read out some details from a note on their operations board. I started to panic because I had a load of puff in the house and I was worried I'd end up back in prison. He said he'd see what he could do. Then he told me I owed him a big favour.'</p> <p>And so Daniel agreed to become a police informant. Within two weeks he had collected a reward of \u00a3400 for 'grassing up' the location of a small cannabis shipment. After that he found it difficult to turn back. 'For the most part it was just a question of keeping my eyes and ears open,' he says. 'Because I was moving around in that circle, people were always coming up to me and asking if I wanted a cheap video or some designer clothes. You'd soon learn that they'd knocked off a lorry load or some warehouse, and I'd just pass it all on. Sometimes it would end in a couple of arrests, sometimes not. No one ever suspected anything. People get caught all the time. That's just the risk anyone involved in crime takes.'</p> <p>In a world where tens of millions of pounds of drugs, stolen goods and stolen cash are changing hands on a regular basis, informants are often the only people consistently managing to make crime pay. Last week's attempt to stage the world's biggest robbery and steal \u00a3350 million of diamonds from the Millennium Dome may have ended in dramatic failure for the gangsters, but the shady underworld character who provided the tip-off is set to be rewarded handsomely.</p> <p>In the case of major robberies, rewards average 10 per cent of the value of the goods involved in the theft - often amounting to tens of thousands of pounds or more. But according to John Wagstaff, of the Association of British Insurers, the amount can vary enormously. 'As a rule, insurance companies don't like paying rewards,' he says. 'Imagine if we offered a \u00a3200 reward for every car stolen and recovered, we would have people queuing up.'</p> <p>Like insurance companies, the police do not encourage large rewards, but Customs routinely pay up to \u00a31,000 per kilo of heroin or cocaine recovered. Payments of \u00a3250,000 or more are relatively common. 'It sounds an enormous sum of money,' says one seasoned investigator, 'but a good tip-off will tell you when the drugs are coming in, who is picking them up and where they are taking them to. The amount of manpower, the number of hours and the huge cost of the operation you would have to put in place to find all that information on your own makes even a quarter of a million pounds seem like a bargain.'</p> <p>Despite controls being introduced to clamp down on the practice, a number of professional villains still manage to make a respectable income by informing on colleagues and twisting the system to their best advantage. Law enforcement officials are well aware that the only people with access to information about who has been involved in the planning of a crime, or who is helping to dispose of the proceeds, are the criminals themselves.</p> <p>Every bank raid of more than a few thousand pounds will generate the offer of a substantial cash reward which can often outweigh the cut a low-ranking member of the gang could expect to earn. The pages of Trace, a monthly magazine covering valuable stolen goods, are filled with details of rewards offered for rare items of furniture, clocks and other objets d'art which amount to far more than an unsophisticated thief could ever hope to make by selling the item on the black market. According to a spokesman for Lloyd's insurance, high-value paintings stolen from country homes will never find buyers at serious prices. Rewards of \u00a350,000 or so can prove tempting at least to one member of the gang.</p> <p>Although the pitfalls are many, the Audit Commission has repeatedly recommended that police increase their use of informants, as the most cost-effective method of tackling crime. Indeed, without information being provided by criminals and, to a lesser extent, members of the public, a phenomenal amount of crime would go unsolved. Between January and September this year, the charity Crimestoppers received 43,000 calls and provided information leading to nearly 4,000 arrests and the recovery of \u00a32.5 million of property, and in September alone \u00a33 million worth of drugs were recovered. Although rewards of \u00a35,000 are regularly paid out by the charity, only 6 per cent of those eligible bother to claim them.</p> <p>The informant network is able to operate because real-life criminal gangs are nothing like those portrayed in film or on television. There are few families or firms where every single member will be willing and able to take part in every venture that crops up. Sometimes one key team member will be in prison or simply unconvinced about the viability of the job. On other occasions they will not have the necessary skills to ensure the operation can run smoothly.</p> <p>It is then that those in charge of the forthcoming job will put the word out among underworld pubs and clubs that they are looking for a getaway driver, a fork-lift truck operator or someone with inside knowledge of telecoms or a specific building. It is during these inquiries that informants gather as much information as they can, hoping for a big pay day or simply to store up credit should they themselves be arrested. The man responsible for grassing up the Dome raid gang is believed to have been offered a role in the robbery but declined, choosing to pass on the information instead.</p> <p>Although informants and grasses are despised throughout the underworld, few of the villains at the top of the criminal tree can operate effectively unless they are also working as registered informants. Not only does such status give them access to hints about what activities the police are most keenly looking at, but it also provides a handy element of mitigation should they ever find themselves before the courts.</p> <p>Few can resist. According to documents obtained by The Observer, even David, the son of Mad Frankie Fraser - the notorious gangland legend famed for his hatred of grasses - has provided information to the police as an informant. 'All self-respecting villains in the underworld find such people contemptible,' Mad Frankie said on numerous occasions, yet during the mid-Nineties his 52-year-old son held dozens of meetings with members of the South-East Regional Crime squad, often close to his home in Streatham, south London, during which he provided tip-offs about Ecstasy and cannabis imports.</p> <p>Double killer Kenneth Noye, a man linked to the Brink's-Mat bullion robbery who once stabbed a policeman to death and was more recently convicted of the road-rage murder of Stephen Cameron, also had a long career as a police informant. He collected large sums for pointing the Flying Squad in the direction of villains, many of whom were rivals he simply wanted out of the way.</p> <p>The history of informers is littered with cases of detectives getting too close, often with messy results. Nurturing an informant requires a close relationship between detective and criminal open to abuse by both sides. Detectives have been known to give informants free rein in their criminal careers, so long as the information continues. Others insist on splitting rewards. Many informants, Kenneth Noye for example, use the system as a way of getting rid of the competition.</p> <p>The temptations and opportunities for corrupt practices are everywhere. In the early Nineties, finance company American Express was asked by officers from the Midlands Regional Crime Squad to provide upfront rewards of up to \u00a3100,000 to be paid to informants who had provided information about the forging of \u00a317 million worth of travellers' cheques.</p> <p>In fact, at the time the first payments were made, no cheques had been produced: The money was needed by the crooks and their police counterparts to purchase the printing equipment.</p> <p><b>Inside facts</b></p> <p>On average, each of Britain's 43 police forces pays out \u00a320,000 to informants each year. There are around 1,200 active registered informants in the country at any one time. A survey of CID officers found that 43 per cent had no registered informants, 22 per cent had one and 17 per cent had five or more.</p> <p>One of the most notorious informants of recent times was David Norris, a petty criminal who passed information about literally thousands of crimes during the Eighties. He was so prolific that many crooks attempted to use a 'Norris defence' to get themselves out of trouble, claiming in court that Norris had set them up. The use of this defence came to an abrupt halt in April 1991 when Norris, then 49, was shot dead outside his south London home.</p> <p>Attempts by police to utilise Jamaican informants to penetrate Yardie gangs backfired badly. One, Eaton Green, received money for information, but continued to commit vicious robberies. In one he held up 400 people in a Nottingham nightclub and robbed them one by one, shooting one man in the leg when he tried to resist.</p> <p>In 1988 Roy Garner, at the time one of the three most important gangland figures in London, earned more than \u00a3250,000 by informing on his colleagues and rivals.</p>",

People get caught all the time. That's just the risk anyone involved in crime takes.' In a world where tens of millions of pounds of drugs, stolen goods and stolen cash are changing hands on a regular basis, informants are often the only people consistently managing to make crime pay. Last week's attempt to stage the world's biggest robbery and steal \u00a3350 million of diamonds from the Millennium Dome may have ended in dramatic failure for the gangsters, but the shady underworld character who provided the tip-off is set to be rewarded handsomely. In the case of major robberies, rewards average 10 per cent of the value of the goods involved in the theft - often amounting to tens of thousands of pounds or more. But according to John Wagstaff, of the Association of British Insurers, the amount can vary enormously. 'As a rule, insurance companies don't like paying rewards,' he says. 'Imagine if we offered a \u00a3200 reward for every car stolen and recovered, we would have people queuing up.' Like insurance companies, the police do not encourage large rewards, but Customs routinely pay up to \u00a31,000 per kilo of heroin or cocaine recovered. Payments of \u00a3250,000 or more are relatively common. 'It sounds an enormous sum of money,' says one seasoned investigator, 'but a good tip-off will tell you when the drugs are coming in, who is picking them up and where they are taking them to. The amount of manpower, the number of hours and the huge cost of the operation you would have to put in place to find all that information on your own makes even a quarter of a million pounds seem like a bargain.' Despite controls being introduced to clamp down on the practice, a number of professional villains still manage to make a respectable income by informing on colleagues and twisting the system to their best advantage. Law enforcement officials are well aware that the only people with access to information about who has been involved in the planning of a crime, or who is helping to dispose of the proceeds, are the criminals themselves. Every bank raid of more than a few thousand pounds will generate the offer of a substantial cash reward which can often outweigh the cut a low-ranking member of the gang could expect to earn. The pages of Trace, a monthly magazine covering valuable stolen goods, are filled with details of rewards offered for rare items of furniture, clocks and other objets d'art which amount to far more than an unsophisticated thief could ever hope to make by selling the item on the black market. According to a spokesman for Lloyd's insurance, high-value paintings stolen from country homes will never find buyers at serious prices. Rewards of \u00a350,000 or so can prove tempting at least to one member of the gang. Although the pitfalls are many, the Audit Commission has repeatedly recommended that police increase their use of informants, as the most cost-effective method of tackling crime. Indeed, without information being provided by criminals and, to a lesser extent, members of the public, a phenomenal amount of crime would go unsolved. Between January and September this year, the charity Crimestoppers received 43,000 calls and provided information leading to nearly 4,000 arrests and the recovery of \u00a32.5 million of property, and in September alone \u00a33 million worth of drugs were recovered. Although rewards of \u00a35,000 are regularly paid out by the charity, only 6 per cent of those eligible bother to claim them. The informant network is able to operate because real-life criminal gangs are nothing like those portrayed in film or on television. There are few families or firms where every single member will be willing and able to take part in every venture that crops up. Sometimes one key team member will be in prison or simply unconvinced about the viability of the job. On other occasions they will not have the necessary skills to ensure the operation can run smoothly. It is then that those in charge of the forthcoming job will put the word out among underworld pubs and clubs that they are looking for a getaway driver, a fork-lift truck operator or someone with inside knowledge of telecoms or a specific building. It is during these inquiries that informants gather as much information as they can, hoping for a big pay day or simply to store up credit should they themselves be arrested. The man responsible for grassing up the Dome raid gang is believed to have been offered a role in the robbery but declined, choosing to pass on the information instead. Although informants and grasses are despised throughout the underworld, few of the villains at the top of the criminal tree can operate effectively unless they are also working as registered informants. Not only does such status give them access to hints about what activities the police are most keenly looking at, but it also provides a handy element of mitigation should they ever find themselves before the courts. Few can resist. According to documents obtained by The Observer, even David, the son of Mad Frankie Fraser - the notorious gangland legend famed for his hatred of grasses - has provided information to the police as an informant. 'All self-respecting villains in the underworld find such people contemptible,' Mad Frankie said on numerous occasions, yet during the mid-Nineties his 52-year-old son held dozens of meetings with members of the South-East Regional Crime squad, often close to his home in Streatham, south London, during which he provided tip-offs about Ecstasy and cannabis imports. Double killer Kenneth Noye, a man linked to the Brink's-Mat bullion robbery who once stabbed a policeman to death and was more recently convicted of the road-rage murder of Stephen Cameron, also had a long career as a police informant. He collected large sums for pointing the Flying Squad in the direction of villains, many of whom were rivals he simply wanted out of the way. The history of informers is littered with cases of detectives getting too close, often with messy results. Nurturing an informant requires a close relationship between detective and criminal open to abuse by both sides. Detectives have been known to give informants free rein in their criminal careers, so long as the information continues. Others insist on splitting rewards. Many informants, Kenneth Noye for example, use the system as a way of getting rid of the competition. The temptations and opportunities for corrupt practices are everywhere. In the early Nineties, finance company American Express was asked by officers from the Midlands Regional Crime Squad to provide upfront rewards of up to \u00a3100,000 to be paid to informants who had provided information about the forging of \u00a317 million worth of travellers' cheques. In fact, at the time the first payments were made, no cheques had been produced: The money was needed by the crooks and their police counterparts to purchase the printing equipment. Inside facts On average, each of Britain's 43 police forces pays out \u00a320,000 to informants each year. There are around 1,200 active registered informants in the country at any one time. A survey of CID officers found that 43 per cent had no registered informants, 22 per cent had one and 17 per cent had five or more. One of the most notorious informants of recent times was David Norris, a petty criminal who passed information about literally thousands of crimes during the Eighties. He was so prolific that many crooks attempted to use a 'Norris defence' to get themselves out of trouble, claiming in court that Norris had set them up. The use of this defence came to an abrupt halt in April 1991 when Norris, then 49, was shot dead outside his south London home. Attempts by police to utilise Jamaican informants to penetrate Yardie gangs backfired badly. One, Eaton Green, received money for information, but continued to commit vicious robberies. In one he held up 400 people in a Nottingham nightclub and robbed them one by one, shooting one man in the leg when he tried to resist. In 1988 Roy Garner, at the time one of the three most important gangland figures in London, earned more than \u00a3250,000 by informing on his colleagues and rivals.",

'For decades people have focused on pre-school children and older teenagers but they have forgotten about the primary school years.' Studies by Guildford University researchers had shown children who had been through the Pyramid increased their social skills, and also produced better creative work.

      "bodyText": "Britain could face huge compensation claims from families of French victims of the human form of mad cow disease as doctors predict that thousands might die across the Channel. Last month Tony Blair announced a multi-million pound no-fault compensation package for families of victims but set no guidelines as to who would be eligible. With most British and French experts agreeing that BSE was a disease 'exported' from the UK to France, lawyers believe there would be a case for French families of variant CJD victims to sue the British government. The French organisation offering support to CJD victims' families - the Association for the Struggle Against Prion-related Diseases - said: 'It is not inconceivable legal action could be taken against the British government.' The association said it would be contacting David Body, the lawyer representing families of British victims, who has said that he believes there is a case that they could be eligible for compensation. Frances Hall, of the Human BSE Foundation which supports variant CJD victims in Britain, said: 'The early cases in France seem to come from the same source as those in Britain and I think it would be morally difficult for the government to rule out compensation for families just because they are not British.' A Department of Health spokeswoman did not rule out paying families of non-British victims but said it was 'too early to say'. So far, only three French people have contracted variant CJD compared with 82 in the UK, but this weekend some French doctors predicted the figures could soar to several thousand. Two French victims have already died, and last week French television screened a documentary about a third victim, Arnaud, 19. The family is taking action against the French state but legal experts believe Britain could be held responsible. In the past fortnight, the number of cases of BSE in French herds has tripled, but so far the epidemic is concentrated around Normandy and Brittany - the region that imported animal feed from Britain. The Philips BSE report published last month confirmed that the spread of the disease was most probably caused by animal feed made from meat and bone meal which contained infected cattle. Britain banned the practice in July 1998, but figures from Customs and Excise reveal that in 1989 France imported more than 15,000 tonnes of meat and bone meal (MBM). By 1990, the amount had dropped to just over 1,000 tonnes and to practically zero the year after. Several cases of BSE in Switzerland are also thought to have come from contaminated British animal feed. French health secretary Dominique Gillot said: 'With the rise of the number of cases of mad cow disease in France it is probable that we will have several tens of cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.' But doctors such as Dr Martine P\u00e9rez believe that there could be a much larger epidemic of variant CJD in France.

It's been pretty intense.'</p> <p>The major smoothes his moustache with a thumb and forefinger, raising binoculars towards the mountain peaks ahead of him, where 'he' has his positions.</p> <p>'He' is the way Indian officers describe the Pakistan army, whose mountain positions surround the major's post on three sides at this point on the line of control, above Uri, in Indian-controlled Kashmir.</p> <p>Rarely a day goes by without an exchange of shelling across the line, the de facto border dividing the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pande says he's never known the shelling to be so heavy, increasing sharply since the collapse in August of a short-lived ceasefire by the main insurgent group fighting Indian rule.</p> <p>The major's post is a warren of tunnels, trenches and bunkers. As we spoke, it was bathed in warm afternoon sunshine. By the end of the month it will be under 10ft of snow, and the men on the frontier will hunker down for the winter.</p> <p>In the valley below, the major's sentiments are echoed by his boss, General John Mukherjee, the commander of Indian forces in Kashmir: 'All our intelligence reports indicate that Pakistan under [General Pervez] Musharraf's orders is trying to upgrade the level of violence.'</p> <p>Even by Kashmir's grisly standards, this month has been particularly violent: more than 60 people have died in clashes with the army, most described as Pakistan-backed 'infiltrators'. A senior Shia Muslim cleric - a supporter of Indian rule - has been assassinated. 'The number of terrorists killed in encounters is approaching the highest ever this year. It's an indication of Pakistan's efforts,' says the general. With a hint of pride, he calls up a colourful bar chart on a computer, drawing deeply on his cigarette.</p> <p>To the general, the Kashmir conflict is now little more than a proxy war waged by Pakistan. But that's not the way it's seen among many of Kashmir's Muslims. Outside the army's fortified Srinagar headquarters, the city is saturated with edgy security forces. Grenade attacks have become an almost daily occurrence. Any youngster is regarded as a potential bomber or gunman. There are reckoned to be between 200,000 and half a million security personnel in Indian-controlled Kashmir - about the highest soldier/civilian ratio in the world. About 50,000 people are estimated to have been killed in a decade of insurgency.</p> <p>In a rundown part of old Srinagar, close to one of the countless army bunkers, two sisters meet and embrace. One wears a burqa, the black veil, the other a colourful scarf. They laugh and kiss. But the story of these two strong-willed women is one of tragedy and struggle. They, like most of the Muslims of the Kashmir Valley, will never accept Indian rule.</p> <p>Parveena, in the colourful scarf, has become a thorn in the side of the Indian authorities for her struggle on behalf of families whose sons have disappeared. In 1990, soldiers took her 18-year-old son away for questioning. Even though she named the soldiers, there has been little sign of justice, or information.</p> <p>She now has 350 cases. She says that earlier this year a government official offered her 1,000 rupees (about \u00a31,500) to drop her case and persuade others to do likewise. 'I'm not going to give in to the government. We don't want any money. If they've been killed, give us their bodies back. I will fight to my last breath. As a mother I have to do this. I shall not rest until I get my revenge on India.'</p> <p>Her sister, who uses the codename Madam Bakhtavar, heads a women's separatist group that agitates in villages and provides support to families whose sons have been killed or arrested by the security forces. She has been arrested four times, and wears her burqa partly out of religious conviction, partly to give her anonymity.</p> <p>'We've suffered a lot at the hands of the security forces,' she says. 'Being a Muslim country, Pakistan's our sympathiser and brother. But we want to be separate. We want independence.'</p> <p>Nevertheless, the sisters were among the millions of Kashmir's brutalised and exhausted people who welcomed July's ceasefire by the Hizbul Mujahideen, the biggest of the armed groups fighting Indian rule. But those hopes were dashed when it collapsed amid an orgy of bombings and shootings after India refused demands that Pakistan be included in any peace talks.</p> <p>Yet the desire for dialogue remains stronger than at any time in the past decade. Indian officials have continued to talk informally with recently released leaders of the Hurriyat Conference, the umbrella organisation of separatist groups, and those leaders have accepted that talks are the only way forward.</p> <p>'If we are genuinely interested in peace, we've got to engage,' says Abdul Ghani Bhat, the chairman of the conference. 'We have to put the past behind us.'</p> <p>Even India's new military chief said on taking office that only a political solution could ultimately solve the Kashmir problem. But what sort of solution? India remains opposed to any Pakistani role in talks, at least to begin with. Hurriyat leaders, many of them no friends of Musharraf, say Pakistan has to be included because it is involved. Islamabad is unlikely to rein in the militants if it is not at the table.</p> <p>One Hurriyat leader said that Indian officials had again raised the possibility of a three-way split of the state between the Muslim Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-dominated Jammu, and the Buddhist-inclined Ladakh.</p> <p>American politics is another factor. Pressure from Washington helped gain the release of Hurriyat leaders and played a part in the summer's ceasefire. But American attention is likely to remain elsewhere for a while.</p> <p>Ian Williams is Asia Correspondent of Channel 4 News</p>",

      "bodyText": "Major Rahul Pande's moustache is as carefully clipped as his accent. 'He's desperate. He wants to infiltrate more and more men before the snow comes. It's been pretty intense.' The major smoothes his moustache with a thumb and forefinger, raising binoculars towards the mountain peaks ahead of him, where 'he' has his positions. 'He' is the way Indian officers describe the Pakistan army, whose mountain positions surround the major's post on three sides at this point on the line of control, above Uri, in Indian-controlled Kashmir. Rarely a day goes by without an exchange of shelling across the line, the de facto border dividing the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pande says he's never known the shelling to be so heavy, increasing sharply since the collapse in August of a short-lived ceasefire by the main insurgent group fighting Indian rule. The major's post is a warren of tunnels, trenches and bunkers. As we spoke, it was bathed in warm afternoon sunshine. By the end of the month it will be under 10ft of snow, and the men on the frontier will hunker down for the winter. In the valley below, the major's sentiments are echoed by his boss, General John Mukherjee, the commander of Indian forces in Kashmir: 'All our intelligence reports indicate that Pakistan under [General Pervez] Musharraf's orders is trying to upgrade the level of violence.' Even by Kashmir's grisly standards, this month has been particularly violent: more than 60 people have died in clashes with the army, most described as Pakistan-backed 'infiltrators'. A senior Shia Muslim cleric - a supporter of Indian rule - has been assassinated. 'The number of terrorists killed in encounters is approaching the highest ever this year. It's an indication of Pakistan's efforts,' says the general. With a hint of pride, he calls up a colourful bar chart on a computer, drawing deeply on his cigarette. To the general, the Kashmir conflict is now little more than a proxy war waged by Pakistan. But that's not the way it's seen among many of Kashmir's Muslims. Outside the army's fortified Srinagar headquarters, the city is saturated with edgy security forces. Grenade attacks have become an almost daily occurrence. Any youngster is regarded as a potential bomber or gunman. There are reckoned to be between 200,000 and half a million security personnel in Indian-controlled Kashmir - about the highest soldier/civilian ratio in the world. About 50,000 people are estimated to have been killed in a decade of insurgency. In a rundown part of old Srinagar, close to one of the countless army bunkers, two sisters meet and embrace. One wears a burqa, the black veil, the other a colourful scarf. They laugh and kiss. But the story of these two strong-willed women is one of tragedy and struggle. They, like most of the Muslims of the Kashmir Valley, will never accept Indian rule. Parveena, in the colourful scarf, has become a thorn in the side of the Indian authorities for her struggle on behalf of families whose sons have disappeared. In 1990, soldiers took her 18-year-old son away for questioning. Even though she named the soldiers, there has been little sign of justice, or information. She now has 350 cases. She says that earlier this year a government official offered her 1,000 rupees (about \u00a31,500) to drop her case and persuade others to do likewise. 'I'm not going to give in to the government. We don't want any money. If they've been killed, give us their bodies back. I will fight to my last breath. As a mother I have to do this. I shall not rest until I get my revenge on India.' Her sister, who uses the codename Madam Bakhtavar, heads a women's separatist group that agitates in villages and provides support to families whose sons have been killed or arrested by the security forces. She has been arrested four times, and wears her burqa partly out of religious conviction, partly to give her anonymity. 'We've suffered a lot at the hands of the security forces,' she says. 'Being a Muslim country, Pakistan's our sympathiser and brother. But we want to be separate. We want independence.' Nevertheless, the sisters were among the millions of Kashmir's brutalised and exhausted people who welcomed July's ceasefire by the Hizbul Mujahideen, the biggest of the armed groups fighting Indian rule. But those hopes were dashed when it collapsed amid an orgy of bombings and shootings after India refused demands that Pakistan be included in any peace talks. Yet the desire for dialogue remains stronger than at any time in the past decade. Indian officials have continued to talk informally with recently released leaders of the Hurriyat Conference, the umbrella organisation of separatist groups, and those leaders have accepted that talks are the only way forward. 'If we are genuinely interested in peace, we've got to engage,' says Abdul Ghani Bhat, the chairman of the conference. 'We have to put the past behind us.' Even India's new military chief said on taking office that only a political solution could ultimately solve the Kashmir problem. But what sort of solution? India remains opposed to any Pakistani role in talks, at least to begin with. Hurriyat leaders, many of them no friends of Musharraf, say Pakistan has to be included because it is involved. Islamabad is unlikely to rein in the militants if it is not at the table. One Hurriyat leader said that Indian officials had again raised the possibility of a three-way split of the state between the Muslim Kashmir Valley, the Hindu-dominated Jammu, and the Buddhist-inclined Ladakh. American politics is another factor. Pressure from Washington helped gain the release of Hurriyat leaders and played a part in the summer's ceasefire. But American attention is likely to remain elsewhere for a while. Ian Williams is Asia Correspondent of Channel 4 News",

      "bodyText": "Robert Kiley, the world-renowned US transport guru appointed by London mayor Ken Livingstone to run the capital's Underground, now recognises that the Government's Public Private Partnership (PPP) financing system for the Tube is 'unworkable'. The news will spark a furious war of wills between Livingstone and the Government over how the Tube is financed - a war that could end in the High Court. 'Kiley came to London with an open mind,' said a source close to the former chief executive and chairman of New York's Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 'But he now thinks it's unworkable. It's not ideological; it's on a pure operational basis. He says it's impossible to run a railway in such a fragmented way. You can't split operations and maintenance. And you can't have such a fragmented management structure.' Last week, it emerged that deputy prime minister John Prescott had refused to allow Kiley, who rescued the New York subway, access to PPP contractual information. Conservative shadow transport minister Bernard Jenkin will tomorrow open a debate in parliament demanding that Kiley be given access to all PPP financial information. Last week Kiley and Livingstone met with PPP representatives for the first time. The bidders were said to 'have sat in silence' while Kiley and Livingstone outlined their position. Privately, many companies within competing PPP consortia know they will gain huge revenue streams if Liv ingstone succeeds in implementing his bond-financed structure. London's mayor wants to inject more than \u00a310 billion into the capital's transport system. PPP consortia will submit their bids to run the Underground in eight days. PPP allows private sector consortiums to carve up the network into three bundles and run it for 30 years.",

      "body": "<p>If you take the Pre Budget Report as your model, UK inflation is spiralling out of control. Its price and its size have increased by a frankly unsustainable 20 per cent over the past year. On current trends the PBR may become bigger than the Budget itself. </p> <p>The PBR may now be Giant Economy Size, but it does not do exactly what it says on the box. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown flagged up talk of 'tax relief on intellectual property'. </p> <p>'Fantastic!' exclaimed advertising executives in coffee bars all over Soho. They get not only tax credits for research and development, but 'relief' on their intellectual property (IP) investments. As some brands, patents, and media rights are worth billions of pounds, tax relief on the acquisition or development of IP could represent a significant fillip to the UK's new economy. </p> <p>But on closer inspection the moves seem to be aimed at reforming tax accounting. Hardly the stuff to divert creatives from their cappuccinos. Indeed the possibility that IP companies may lose out in any reforms should have them choking on their lattes. </p> <p>It used to be simple. Businesses invested in machines. Those machines manufactured good. Governments keen to encourage investment in modern machines devised capital allowances and tax relief against companies' tax to help businesses think long term. </p> <p>But vast investments in the world of intellectual property - brands, trademarks, sports media rights and patents - have complicated the matter. There is nothing much to show for these assets other than pieces of paper or information and, as intangibles, they do not qualify for tax concessions. Nor, given their classification as capital, can their cost be written off against current spending. Intangibles tend to get the worst of both worlds. There are exceptions - tax allowances are made for certain types of patent, for films and industrial know-how, for example - but the system is a hotchpotch of individual measures, rife with disincentives to invest in intangibles. </p> <p>The mobility of intangible capital also leads to a high degree of sensitivity to different international tax regimes. In the US, relief for the cost of investment in such intangibles is available over 15 years. Multinationals that have bought British brands or patents can purchase through a US subsidiary and license back to the UK to take advantage of this relief. Not only does this reduce the tax take for the Inland Revenue; it also pushes income flows and R&amp;D out of the UK. </p> <p>Step in the Government in 1998 with a first stab at reform. Last week a third consultation paper was released, having taken on board representations from companies. The net result is that: 'intellectual property' has been defined to include goodwill; relief will be based on accounts-based depreciation rather than capital allowances; and special relief for films and science research will remain separate. </p> <p>The spirit of any new legislation has been seen this year. Special laws were passed for companies buying 3G mobile phone licences. Standard UK practice grants no relief for the purchase of such intangible assets. The new measures will result in a total of \u00a37bn relief on any corporation tax paid by the licence holders over the 20-year lifetime of the licences. </p> <p>Similarly, the thrust of reform seems to allow tax relief based on allocating an annual value to IP over a specific lifetime. So if a company buys 10-year football broadcast rights for \u00a31 billion, it would, under current proposals, be amortised at \u00a3100 million a year and receive relief against corporation tax of \u00a330m a year. </p> <p>So is this an overlooked tax bonanza for weightless industries? Possibly. But we won't know until March's Budget. The main thrust of the reforms was on simplification. By more closely attaching relief to the appropriate investments, investors may be better informed about returns. 'Because tax relief is not given to IP, there is no need to separate it out, and it tends to be wrapped up with other things in the balance sheet,' says David O'Keeffe of KPMG. </p> <p>Some intellectual property companies feel that these moves are more important than sorting out share options. 'Handling intellectual property from the accounting perspective is a tangible recognition of the value of biotechnology, and of IP,' says Paul Murphy, chief executive of Cambridge-based Gemini Genomics. 'If the appropriate moves are made, this would be by far and away the greatest financial benefit.' </p> <p>Originally the Inland Revenue insisted that any changes would be revenue-neutral - any bonanzas would be offset by capital gains tax on companies that sell IP assets. That provision has been quietly dropped. </p> <p>Costing such measures is extremely difficult, and this is a reflection of the more general complications inherent in measuring intellectual property. Brand valuation, for example, is the most developed form of IP valuation, but a contro versial issue. So assessing who will lose out if current proposals are implemented is a tricky question. </p> <p>'There may well be losers in moving from the old system of capital gains,' says O'Keeffe. Those companies that benefit from tapering, relief from inflation effects, and the rollover relief for goodwill may suffer.. </p> <p>The Revenue would gain from companies selling their IP assets to other companies. Profits on disposals of IP would be subject to tax as income, and the question is whether, for individual companies, such new taxes would be balanced off by the new reliefs. </p> <p>The Treasury is very sensitive about the possibility of these new measures exacerbating the perennial problem of companies depressing profits to pay less tax. But tax specialists point out that listed companies do at least have to prove their profitability to the stock market and would have few reasons to make such moves. </p> <p>Potentially more worrying for the Treasury is the fact that some analysts doubt whether the changes will make much difference to entrepreneurial culture. Startups are more likely to be making losses, and therefore would not benefit from tax relief; R&amp;D tax credits on the other hand, can be cashed if companies are making losses. </p> <p>Perhaps the Treasury should consider a similar system for IP, but that would cost money. That, as one might suspect, is not the Government's plan. </p> <p> <strong>The speech in full</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394543,00.html\">Part 1: the economy</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394550,00.html\">Part 2: the fiscal stance</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394552,00.html\">Part 3: families and pensioners</a></p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/politics/story/0,3604,394223,00.html\">8 November 2000: Pensioners call at No 10 - Guardian</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/budget2000/article/0,2763,394362,00.html\">8 November 2000, explained: the pre-budget report </a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,394122,00.html\">8 November 2000, analysis: My friends the truckers - Leanda de Lisle</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/welfare/\">Related special report: welfare reform</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Labour/\">Related special report: New Labour in power</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/petrol/\">Related special report: the petrol war</a> </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong> <br><a href=\"http://www.peoples-fuel-lobby.co.uk/\">Campaign - People's Fuel Lobby</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.rha.net/fairplay2000/\">Key player - the Road Haulage Association</a><br><a href=\"http://www.freighttaxes.com/\"> Key player - Freight Taxes.com</a><br><a href=\"http://www.natpencon.org.uk/index.html\">Key player - National pensioners convention</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/1999/index.html\">Budgets and pre-budgets since 1994 - HM Treasury</a></p>",

Two poachers, handcuffed to each other amid the seized remains of a giraffe, two eland and a kudu, seem resigned to their fate after being arrested by game scouts. The police will be along 'shortly' - as soon as they have found a lift.</p> <p>'We are only finding about a third of what is being poached,' says a weary Hulme, chairman of the Chiredzi Wildlife Conservancy. 'Sometimes we find snared animals which have been dead for months.'</p> <p>The conservancy's land and animals are being targeted by President Robert Mugabe's war veterans, by squatters and by what he refers to as 'opportunists' taking advantage of the new lawlessness which has swept the Zimbabwe countryside.</p> <p>According to Hulme, poaching in the 250,000-acre conservancy area, in the low veld south of Harare, has hit critical proportions. A handful of unarmed game scouts are sent out daily, but with such a vast area to patrol their efforts are often in vain. 'We find the snares, the snared animals, but rarely the poachers,' he says.</p> <p>It is an uphill battle, as more and more squatters arrive each day, buoyed by Mugabe's anti-white rhetoric and illegal land seizures, bringing further wanton destruction to a fragile eco-system. The police are of little use, seemingly reluctant to be drawn into the war of attrition between landowners and government-backed squatters.</p> <p>'It's a free-for-all and if it carries on there won't be much left to save. As it is now, it will take three to four years to get things back to normal. But only if it stops now,' says Hulme, who has been with the conservancy for 15 years.</p> <p>Fourteen of the 16 member farms within the conservancy were gazetted for acquisition in 1997, since when members have conducted a legal battle to have them delisted.

      "bodyText": "George Hulme surveys the dead animal booty, spread at his feet like some ghoulish picnic in the hot morning sun. Two poachers, handcuffed to each other amid the seized remains of a giraffe, two eland and a kudu, seem resigned to their fate after being arrested by game scouts. The police will be along 'shortly' - as soon as they have found a lift. 'We are only finding about a third of what is being poached,' says a weary Hulme, chairman of the Chiredzi Wildlife Conservancy. 'Sometimes we find snared animals which have been dead for months.' The conservancy's land and animals are being targeted by President Robert Mugabe's war veterans, by squatters and by what he refers to as 'opportunists' taking advantage of the new lawlessness which has swept the Zimbabwe countryside. According to Hulme, poaching in the 250,000-acre conservancy area, in the low veld south of Harare, has hit critical proportions. A handful of unarmed game scouts are sent out daily, but with such a vast area to patrol their efforts are often in vain. 'We find the snares, the snared animals, but rarely the poachers,' he says. It is an uphill battle, as more and more squatters arrive each day, buoyed by Mugabe's anti-white rhetoric and illegal land seizures, bringing further wanton destruction to a fragile eco-system. The police are of little use, seemingly reluctant to be drawn into the war of attrition between landowners and government-backed squatters. 'It's a free-for-all and if it carries on there won't be much left to save. As it is now, it will take three to four years to get things back to normal. But only if it stops now,' says Hulme, who has been with the conservancy for 15 years. Fourteen of the 16 member farms within the conservancy were gazetted for acquisition in 1997, since when members have conducted a legal battle to have them delisted. 'This is an arid, low-rainfall area, totally unsuitable for dry-land resettlement schemes. That's something the squatters will discover in due course,' says Hulme. Fellow conservancy member Barry Style, director of Buffalo Range, a game reserve founded by his grandfather in the Fifties, says poaching has risen tenfold in the past six months. 'There has always been a poaching problem, but nothing on this scale,' says Style, whose farm was served a compulsory acquisition order in August.

      "body": "<p>Had it not been for the long queue for tickets at St Petersburg's central railway station, Lara Matveyeva might never have found herself working in a German brothel - one of hundreds of thousands of East European women unwittingly sold into prostitution in the West.</p> <p>As it was, the slow movement of the queue provided an ideal forum for recruitment. The tedium of waiting was lifted by the appearance of a friendly, well-dressed woman behind her.</p> <p>Enticed into conversation, Lara told her that she was returning home to a job and a town that bored her. The woman replied that she had a friend in Germany who was looking for help with the housework for a few months, and that if Lara was eager for a change she could put them in touch. The money would be bad, but she would be required to do little except water the plants and feed the pets; most importantly, it would be a chance to travel.</p> <p>Only mildly surprised by this stranger's desire to be kind, Lara accepted. A few days later she was travelling by bus to Hamburg. A Russian woman was there to meet her at the bus stop, accompanied her to a flat nearby and took her passport from her - for safekeeping. After three days she told Lara, then 24, that there was no housework to be done, so she would have to work as a prostitute.</p> <p>Intelligent and well-educated, it nevertheless took her six months to escape from imprisonment in a series of bars and nightclubs in Hamburg and its suburbs. Most of the other Russians she met there had given up even trying to return home. Even now that she is back in her small provincial town on the southern border with Ukraine, she remains so anxious about reprisals from the people who organised her trip that she refuses to reveal her real name.</p> <p>Her horror at her own experience and at the scale of the problem in Russia motivated her - in spite of the dangers - to start tackling the problem. She was one of the participants at a conference of 43 anti-trafficking organisations from 25 regions of Russia and six former Soviet republics that finished last week.</p> <p>These groups hope to combat a phenomenon that, according to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, has swept up something like 500,000 Russian women in the past decade (although the trade's clandestine nature makes it impossible to estimate accurately the numbers). Activists say that, despite its scale, human trafficking is still not treated seriously by the Russian government.</p> <p>'There is a great reluctance to recognise and address this problem,' said one of the conference organisers, who also requested anonymity.

      "bodyText": "Had it not been for the long queue for tickets at St Petersburg's central railway station, Lara Matveyeva might never have found herself working in a German brothel - one of hundreds of thousands of East European women unwittingly sold into prostitution in the West. As it was, the slow movement of the queue provided an ideal forum for recruitment. The tedium of waiting was lifted by the appearance of a friendly, well-dressed woman behind her. Enticed into conversation, Lara told her that she was returning home to a job and a town that bored her. The woman replied that she had a friend in Germany who was looking for help with the housework for a few months, and that if Lara was eager for a change she could put them in touch. The money would be bad, but she would be required to do little except water the plants and feed the pets; most importantly, it would be a chance to travel. Only mildly surprised by this stranger's desire to be kind, Lara accepted. A few days later she was travelling by bus to Hamburg. A Russian woman was there to meet her at the bus stop, accompanied her to a flat nearby and took her passport from her - for safekeeping. After three days she told Lara, then 24, that there was no housework to be done, so she would have to work as a prostitute. Intelligent and well-educated, it nevertheless took her six months to escape from imprisonment in a series of bars and nightclubs in Hamburg and its suburbs. Most of the other Russians she met there had given up even trying to return home. Even now that she is back in her small provincial town on the southern border with Ukraine, she remains so anxious about reprisals from the people who organised her trip that she refuses to reveal her real name. Her horror at her own experience and at the scale of the problem in Russia motivated her - in spite of the dangers - to start tackling the problem. She was one of the participants at a conference of 43 anti-trafficking organisations from 25 regions of Russia and six former Soviet republics that finished last week. These groups hope to combat a phenomenon that, according to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, has swept up something like 500,000 Russian women in the past decade (although the trade's clandestine nature makes it impossible to estimate accurately the numbers). Activists say that, despite its scale, human trafficking is still not treated seriously by the Russian government. 'There is a great reluctance to recognise and address this problem,' said one of the conference organisers, who also requested anonymity. 'The reality is that it is a modern slave trade, just as profitable as it was 200 years ago.' The trade stems from a mixture of poverty, naivety, a weak legal system and a prevalence of well-organised criminal groups. Ignorance lies at the heart of the problem. According to MiraMed, the charity that organised this month's conference, around 90 per cent of the women trafficked abroad are unaware that they are headed for a career in the sex industry. The small ads columns of provincial newspapers are filled with adverts encouraging young, attractive women to apply for work as waitresses in Italy or barmaids and nannies in Germany. With the economy in Russia's remote regions deeply depressed, many women are desperate for an escape. The novelty of travel in the West remains high, while awareness about life there is low. Not suspecting any possible threat, the women - mostly in their teens or early twenties - are easy prey. For the groups organising the trafficking there are few obstacles. Compared with selling drugs or weapons abroad, trade in women is highly profitable and relatively risk-free. Unlike guns or drugs, women can be sold over and over again, acting as a regular, long-term source of income. And, crucially, in Russia there is still no specific legislation which decrees illegal the trade in humans . The few women who make their way back to Russia have no recourse to the law. Even now, two years after her return, she has told none of her friends or family about what happened in Germany; they believe she spent an uneventful few months as an au pair.

The spaniel trots along behind, sniffing lampposts.</p> <p>The man's name is Robert Bourne - millionaire, Labour donor, friend to the rich and influential. He has just faced one of the toughest weeks of his life. For the past five days Bourne has been locked in delicate negotiations with the Government over the most significant deal Labour will ever have to secure. If this goes wrong, the Prime Minister, and the whole New Labour project, will be horribly damaged.</p> <p>Bourne is the head of Legacy plc, the company bidding to run the Millennium Dome after 31 December.

The other option is to level the structure to the ground. But that would take months and cost millions of pounds, a lengthy reminder of the Government's failure. If the Prime Minister calls an election in May as expected, the last pieces of the failed attraction would still be standing at Greenwich. The metaphor would be clear.</p> <p>Last week the National Audit Office's report on the financial management of the Dome was a scathing analysis of a project that has lurched from one mismanaged crisis to another. The Government hoped that would be the end of the matter, the last negative blow. But this week will see another chapter in the crisis. Lord Falconer, the Cabinet Office Minister in charge of the Dome, has ignored calls for him to resign. If the Government fails to sell the Dome to Bourne, those calls will become louder.</p> <p>Bourne is starting to lose patience. He has just given the Government a deadline - if he and English Partner ships, the official agency charged with selling the Dome, have not completed the deal by Friday, he's off.</p> <p>Senior Government sources have told The Observer the settlement is very close. One other thing is close: the end of the year, just seven weeks away. If the Government doesn't succeed with Bourne, then Plan B is rightly seen as the 'nuclear option'. The thing is, all this could have been sorted out more than a year ago.</p> <p>Bourne was brought up in Kensington, west London, the son of a cloth dealer who had a shop called Tracy in Bond Street. He made his fortune from property - providing affordable office space to small firms struggling to get a toehold in the capital.</p> <p>He is married to Sarah Greene, the former actress who runs the Old Vic Theatre. The couple make regular appearances in the Court and Social columns of the Times. Greene over lunch persuaded Kevin Spacey to become a director of Old Vic Productions and Lord Attenborough to be its chairman. Dame Judi Dench and Jeremy Irons are also investors.</p> <p>It was through acting that Bourne and Greene first came across Chris Smith, now Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the government department responsible for the Dome. Smith is also chairman of the Millennium Commission, which has overseen the running of the attraction.</p> <p>This most useful of friendships began before the last general election. Greene was interested in launching a new theatre in north London, a redevelopment of the old Collins Music Hall on Islington Green. Smith was the local MP and keen to support the project. Bourne donated \u00a32,000 to Smith's constituency funds. The two have been friends ever since.</p> <p>It was the start of Bourne's close relationship with Labour. Reports say he has given at least \u00a366,000 to the party and some estimate it is more like \u00a31 million.</p> <p>In December last year the first reports about his involvement with the Dome appeared. The attraction had not even opened, but Ministers were already concerned about what to do with the structure on its closure 12 months later.</p> <p>Bourne announced that he was offering an initial fee of \u00a350 million to take the Dome off the Government's hands. He was one of nine consortia interested in buying into Greenwich.</p> <p>His idea was for an environmentally friendly 'knowledge park' - a vast expanse of e-business offices separated by an indoor forest of trees and hedges. Holes would be cut in the roof to let in more daylight for the 10,000 people he predicted would work in the high-tech casbah. It would be London's very own Silicon Valley, a place where entrepreneurs could hone their skills and pop out for a quick sushi between multi-million-pound deals.</p> <p>'What we are looking at here is the possibility of nurturing tomorrow's wealth and of creating the next Bill Gates,' he said.</p> <p>His arrival on the scene produced cries of cronyism. Peter Ainsworth, the Opposition spokesman for culture, said the announcement that Bourne had been shortlisted along with Japanese banking conglomerate Nomura to bid for the Dome earlier this year had a 'tediously familiar air about it'.</p> <p>'Finding a significant donor to the Labour Party on the shortlist is exactly the kind of thing we have come to expect,' he said.</p> <p>Bourne denies the charges, pointing out that in the Eighties he was very close to the Thatcher-supporting Saatchi brothers and still plays tennis with Charles Saatchi every Sunday. Lord Bell, the Thatcher-supporting public relations figure, advised him on defeating Nomura and Lord McAlpine, the Conservative donor, and is a friend and supporter of the Old Vic.</p> <p>When Bourne was told in July he had lost out to Nomura, he was desperately disappointed. Guy Hands, who led Nomura's bid, said he would still run it as a visitor attraction, something the Government was keen on.</p> <p>Bourne went away to lick his wounds. But the fight was not over. Hands became increasingly worried at the messy state of the Dome's finances. In a private letter to Falconer, he said the Dome's management had repeatedly misled him and that trust had been 'severely undermined'.</p> <p>'We have been misled on the visitor figures,' Hands said. 'Misled on ticket price reductions, misled on properties owned by NMEC (the company that runs the Dome) . . . and on safety and repairs and on the state of the contracts.' Financial information provided to Hands, he said, was 'materially incorrect'.</p> <p>In the first week of September, Hands wrote to Falconer again, saying the deal was effectively off. Four days later Nomura officially withdrew.</p> <p>Falconer was desperate. What the hell could the Government do now to save the Dome? He rang Bourne and asked him to a meeting. Falconer was blunt: he would like Legacy to re-enter the process.</p> <p>Such was the importance of Falconer's message a meeting was set up between Blair and Bourne.

Asked in April if they were interested in visiting the attraction, 61 per cent of the public said they were not. That figure rose to 68 per cent in August.

The paranoia, violence and crime associated with the drug - crack users can easily get through \u00a3500-worth of 'rocks' in a day - causes huge, and well-documented, damage.</p> <p>But the 'white-collar crackheads' are a new and different phenomenon. Many can finance their habit without recourse to theft, fraud or prostitution and are often unapologetic about their habits. Paul, an Oxbridge arts graduate, is a 37-year-old corporate communications manager with a major company in London. He has held down a successful career, married and become a father, all the while maintaining what he calls 'a recreational class-A drug habit'.</p> <p>'I started smoking heroin about nine or 10 years ago with two friends, because I liked the feeling it gave me. Other people were dabbling with Ecstasy and cocaine, but I preferred something which eased my mind, not sent it racing. I didn't want to be a babbling idiot,' he said.</p> <p>'I switched to crack because my regular dealer did last year. People think you have to be an addict, but that is nonsense. I have a pipe, but it comes out once every few weeks. This is something I enjoy and I have the money to indulge myself, so why the hell not?'</p> <p>Such use is increasingly common. Smoked in cigarettes or with cannabis, crack is difficult to detect in a crowded nightclub.</p> <p>Aidan Gray, national co-ordinator of Focus, a specialist crack research and support agency, said crack is now the drug of choice for many clubbers. In central London, smaller 'clubbing rocks', half the price and half the size of normal, are sold for around \u00a310 each. 'Crack is more and more popular on the dance scene,' Gray said. 'There are clubs in London - and elsewhere in Britain - which are known for crack use.'</p> <p>Gray said that the vast bulk of recreational crack use is undetected. 'The statistics don't reflect the scale of it at all. If wealthy people are in trouble, they will usually go to private clinics or doctors. Or they just keep using and no one ever knows.'</p> <p>Nor is the problem restricted to London, Manchester and Merseyside. In the North-West, there has been a tenfold increase in cocaine use - mainly crack - in the past 10 years. In Scotland, according to some reports, the number of new crack addicts has risen twelvefold in the past four years. The police say they have detected people travelling into London from throughout the Home Counties to buy crack.</p> <p>Many fear that, with the numbers of affluent crack users growing every day, the drug may lose its stigma and its dangers will be forgotten.</p> <p>'You can go into work on a Monday and say you took a lot of Ecstasy last night, and these days your colleagues may not give you any grief,' said Tim Bottomley, manager of a drugs project in Manchester. 'Currently you can't do the same with crack. If crack becomes acceptable, that's when it will be most dangerous.'</p> <p>Some names have been changed in this article.</p> <p><br><a href=\"mailto:jason.burke@observer.co.uk\">jason.burke@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

The paranoia, violence and crime associated with the drug - crack users can easily get through \u00a3500-worth of 'rocks' in a day - causes huge, and well-documented, damage. But the 'white-collar crackheads' are a new and different phenomenon. Many can finance their habit without recourse to theft, fraud or prostitution and are often unapologetic about their habits. Paul, an Oxbridge arts graduate, is a 37-year-old corporate communications manager with a major company in London. He has held down a successful career, married and become a father, all the while maintaining what he calls 'a recreational class-A drug habit'. 'I started smoking heroin about nine or 10 years ago with two friends, because I liked the feeling it gave me. Other people were dabbling with Ecstasy and cocaine, but I preferred something which eased my mind, not sent it racing. I didn't want to be a babbling idiot,' he said. 'I switched to crack because my regular dealer did last year. People think you have to be an addict, but that is nonsense. I have a pipe, but it comes out once every few weeks. This is something I enjoy and I have the money to indulge myself, so why the hell not?' Such use is increasingly common. Smoked in cigarettes or with cannabis, crack is difficult to detect in a crowded nightclub. Aidan Gray, national co-ordinator of Focus, a specialist crack research and support agency, said crack is now the drug of choice for many clubbers. In central London, smaller 'clubbing rocks', half the price and half the size of normal, are sold for around \u00a310 each. 'Crack is more and more popular on the dance scene,' Gray said. 'There are clubs in London - and elsewhere in Britain - which are known for crack use.' Gray said that the vast bulk of recreational crack use is undetected. 'The statistics don't reflect the scale of it at all. If wealthy people are in trouble, they will usually go to private clinics or doctors. Or they just keep using and no one ever knows.' Nor is the problem restricted to London, Manchester and Merseyside. In the North-West, there has been a tenfold increase in cocaine use - mainly crack - in the past 10 years. In Scotland, according to some reports, the number of new crack addicts has risen twelvefold in the past four years. The police say they have detected people travelling into London from throughout the Home Counties to buy crack. Many fear that, with the numbers of affluent crack users growing every day, the drug may lose its stigma and its dangers will be forgotten. 'You can go into work on a Monday and say you took a lot of Ecstasy last night, and these days your colleagues may not give you any grief,' said Tim Bottomley, manager of a drugs project in Manchester. 'Currently you can't do the same with crack. If crack becomes acceptable, that's when it will be most dangerous.' Some names have been changed in this article. jason.burke@observer.co.uk",

As the recount continues in Florida, politicians in Dublin and Belfast are waking up to the fact that, whoever wins, Northern Ireland is unlikely to be a priority on the new President's agenda.</p> <p>Bill Clinton's departure from the White House will mean an end to the late-night phone calls to Belfast, urging politicians on both sides to make the necessary compromises for peace.</p> <p>The annual celebrations for St Patrick's Day, when the White House has been decked out in all shades of orange and green, will be more low-key next year. It's been suggested that the party may be moved to New York where Hillary Clinton, who has visited Northern Ireland five times, has just been elected a US senator.</p> <p>Before Clinton rides off into the sunset, the British and Irish Governments hope that he may be able to work one last bit of magic for the peace process. The President is to make a trip to Ireland next month, visiting Belfast and Dublin.</p> <p>It will be primarily a lap of honour recognising the contribution he has made. But Northern Ireland's politicians are once again in difficulties over the decommissioning of IRA weapons. An appeal by President Clinton could provide an opportunity for the IRA to move on the issue by re-establishing contact with General John de Chastelain's commission. This will allow David Trimble to lift the ban which he has placed on Sinn Fein members of the power-sharing Executive attending meetings of cross-border bodies.</p> <p>Such a resolution of the present impasse will get the Belfast Agreement back on track; it would also be a graceful recognition of Clinton's involvement in the process. It is an achievement of which he himself is keenly aware. Earlier this month at a fundraising event for his wife's campaign in New York, the President told the Irish-American audience: 'I want to tell you how grateful I am that somehow, some way when I first started running for President the Irish found me.'</p> <p>In return the Irish-American community has stood loyally with him through all the scandals.

      "bodyText": "Power is slipping away, admittedly rather slowly, from Bill Clinton. As the recount continues in Florida, politicians in Dublin and Belfast are waking up to the fact that, whoever wins, Northern Ireland is unlikely to be a priority on the new President's agenda. Bill Clinton's departure from the White House will mean an end to the late-night phone calls to Belfast, urging politicians on both sides to make the necessary compromises for peace. The annual celebrations for St Patrick's Day, when the White House has been decked out in all shades of orange and green, will be more low-key next year. It's been suggested that the party may be moved to New York where Hillary Clinton, who has visited Northern Ireland five times, has just been elected a US senator. Before Clinton rides off into the sunset, the British and Irish Governments hope that he may be able to work one last bit of magic for the peace process. The President is to make a trip to Ireland next month, visiting Belfast and Dublin. It will be primarily a lap of honour recognising the contribution he has made. But Northern Ireland's politicians are once again in difficulties over the decommissioning of IRA weapons. An appeal by President Clinton could provide an opportunity for the IRA to move on the issue by re-establishing contact with General John de Chastelain's commission. This will allow David Trimble to lift the ban which he has placed on Sinn Fein members of the power-sharing Executive attending meetings of cross-border bodies. Such a resolution of the present impasse will get the Belfast Agreement back on track; it would also be a graceful recognition of Clinton's involvement in the process. It is an achievement of which he himself is keenly aware. Earlier this month at a fundraising event for his wife's campaign in New York, the President told the Irish-American audience: 'I want to tell you how grateful I am that somehow, some way when I first started running for President the Irish found me.' In return the Irish-American community has stood loyally with him through all the scandals. On the night that Ken Starr delivered the impeachment document to Congress, 800 Irish-Americans gathered at the White House. Not a word of criticism was heard, and this was something for which Clinton thanked his supporters earlier this week. Niall O'Dowd, editor of the New York-based Irish Voice newspaper,was one of a small group of Irish-Americans who sought out Bill Clinton when he was running for President in 1992.

      "body": "<p>The rest of the world's traditional joke about democracy in the United States, a crack of both mockery and admiration, is that Americans even elect their dog catchers. The rest of the world's new joke about democracy in the United States is that Americans can't even elect a President.</p> <p>In the best home-grown quip of the night, Bill Clinton remarked that the people had spoken, but it would take a while to decide what they had said. Actually, so long as you are not a politician, a TV anchor or a lawyer, it is really quite easy to name the man who should become the most powerful person on the planet. I know who has won the election. So do you. My six-year-old daughter can figure it out. She may be no electoral expert, but she has a firm grasp of fairness and natural justice. Elections are won by the man with the most votes. Al Gore has won the American election.</p> <p>Block your ears against the cacophonous cascade of blither and blather about the convolutions of the American constitution and voting papers apparently designed to test for membership of Mensa, that wall of noise which has bludgeoned our senses since they began bungee-jumping for the White House. Shut out that din. Fix your compass by a simple fact, the one straightforward thing to emerge from this tragi-farcical morass which transfixes the world. On the latest count across America, George W. Bush has some 48,890,000 votes. Al Gore has some 49,110,00 votes. Al Gore has won the American election, by a narrow margin for sure, but emphatically win it he did. Ignore all that tosh saying that whoever emerges as the next President will lack a mandate. It is true that Bush will not have a mandate - he lost. Gore has a mandate - he won.</p> <p>In fact, the Vice-President has won more votes, whether you are counting ballots or counting share, than Clinton did in either 1992 or 1996. In a smoothly organised democracy, George Bush would already have made a pretty little speech from Texas gracefully accepting defeat and Al Gore would be in Washington preparing to take office.</p> <p>There would be no room to wrangle but for the arcanities of the antique electoral college, the workings of which, even the existence of, were a mystery to many Americans until the closeness of Tuesday night's results suddenly made an issue of its curious mechanics. It turns out that the world's only superpower and proudest democracy has a Heath Robinson contraption for a constitutional engine.</p> <p>Now, I have read the learned disquisitions which have been rolling out from the professors and the pundits. I understand that the Founding Fathers, who enjoy a demigod status in the United States and whose constitution is still treated as if it were a tablet that Moses returned with from Mount Sinai, wanted to protect the rights of the states. Less nobly, they designed the electoral college as a filter against the possibility that the vulgar masses might do something wild. Remember, this system was constructed in 1787, a time when you would be marked as a lunatic for suggesting that women should have the vote, never mind blacks. Even so, the intention of the Founding Fathers never seems to have been to deny office to the man who had won and confer power on the man who had lost.</p> <p>That is the perverse outcome that threatens to happen in the United States. Should George Bush be awarded the 25 electoral college votes of Florida - and he gets every one of those votes, however close and contested the result in that state - then he will have a majority in the national electoral college even though he lacks a majority from the people. It is highly suspect whether he even deserves to carry the votes of the Sunshine State. Bad smells are wafting from the Florida swamps. Thanks to a ballot paper which was an eyesight test cum brainteaser, thousands of votes in Palm Beach County, almost certainly more than enough to make the difference, were either spoilt or accidentally cast for Pat Buchanan. That Hitler-admiring right-winger cheerfully says that he got votes from elderly liberal Jews that were meant for Al Gore. The real and present danger for Americans is that they will be landed with a President whom the majority did not want as a result of rotten ballots in a crucial state and a malfunctioning mechanism giving the first prize to the runner-up.</p> <p>There are those who say that, however eccentric and perilous its effects, the letter of a constitution must always be followed. This misses the bigger picture. The most important element of any constitution is its spirit. And the animating spirit of America is supposed to be democracy. No one can exactly predict the reverberations for an advanced country of making the loser the leader. But I think it is a pretty sure guess that the consequences are all going to be bad.</p> <p>The shockwaves will be first felt in America itself. Government there already suffers from a crisis of legitimacy as less and less of the public can be bothered to engage with a political process that seems to mean and do nothing for huge swathes of the electorate. All the mature democracies are diseased by this. In America, it is pandemic. This election was accounted a good one because, after the tightest of races upon which the candidates blew a cool one billion dollars, they managed to attract just over half of the potential electorate to a polling station. If the result is to give the White House to the man who came second, the payback from the voters is not hard to imagine. Greater still will be bitter cynicism about the system, and angry alienation from it. George Bush will be an unPresident.</p> <p>This will be a woeful outcome for the cause of democracy in the rest of the world. America is not the paragon republic of its self-conceit. The shining city on the hill is built on quagmires of corruption and besmirched with special interests. For all that, America has had a better idea of freedom and justice than most other nations for most of history. The enemies of liberty gloat already. Those to whom America preached the virtues of democracy are returning the sermons to sender. The foreign minister of Cuba, making delicious mischief at the expense of those who have long lectured the Castro regime about its abuses, says he will send observers to the Florida count. A similar suggestion comes from that byword for human rights, Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe. Vladimir Putin, the old KGB hand, makes a sarcastic offer of Russian assistance in conducting elections. The Moscow method is to choose the President before they have the vote. We are now just waiting for Baghdad to dispatch to Washington a team of independent Iraqi scrutineers.</p> <p>This isn't fair on America, but it is inevitable. If George Bush becomes President, he will be seen to have seized the position on the back of a murky vote in a state governed by his brother. The truth may be more complex, but that is how it will look in the eyes of the world. President Dubya will be barren of legitimacy at home and devoid of moral authority abroad. The Saddam Husseins of the planet, every petty, vicious dictator around the world, will scoff in the face of America.</p> <p>Anyone who cares about the wider cause of democracy has to hope that the United States can find an exit off this freeway to disaster. Fortunately, their arrangements do provide time to untangle the impasse. Talk of a constitutional crisis, talk of America without a President, talk promoted by the acolytes of George Bush to bounce Al Gore into surrendering his claim to the White House - all that talk is specious. America has a President. Bill Clinton remains Chief Executive until the date when he is scheduled to hand the seals of power to his successor. That date is 20 January, more than two months away.

      "bodyText": "The rest of the world's traditional joke about democracy in the United States, a crack of both mockery and admiration, is that Americans even elect their dog catchers. The rest of the world's new joke about democracy in the United States is that Americans can't even elect a President. In the best home-grown quip of the night, Bill Clinton remarked that the people had spoken, but it would take a while to decide what they had said. Actually, so long as you are not a politician, a TV anchor or a lawyer, it is really quite easy to name the man who should become the most powerful person on the planet. I know who has won the election. So do you. My six-year-old daughter can figure it out. She may be no electoral expert, but she has a firm grasp of fairness and natural justice. Elections are won by the man with the most votes. Al Gore has won the American election. Block your ears against the cacophonous cascade of blither and blather about the convolutions of the American constitution and voting papers apparently designed to test for membership of Mensa, that wall of noise which has bludgeoned our senses since they began bungee-jumping for the White House. Shut out that din. Fix your compass by a simple fact, the one straightforward thing to emerge from this tragi-farcical morass which transfixes the world. On the latest count across America, George W. Bush has some 48,890,000 votes. Al Gore has some 49,110,00 votes. Al Gore has won the American election, by a narrow margin for sure, but emphatically win it he did. Ignore all that tosh saying that whoever emerges as the next President will lack a mandate. It is true that Bush will not have a mandate - he lost. Gore has a mandate - he won. In fact, the Vice-President has won more votes, whether you are counting ballots or counting share, than Clinton did in either 1992 or 1996. In a smoothly organised democracy, George Bush would already have made a pretty little speech from Texas gracefully accepting defeat and Al Gore would be in Washington preparing to take office. There would be no room to wrangle but for the arcanities of the antique electoral college, the workings of which, even the existence of, were a mystery to many Americans until the closeness of Tuesday night's results suddenly made an issue of its curious mechanics. It turns out that the world's only superpower and proudest democracy has a Heath Robinson contraption for a constitutional engine. Now, I have read the learned disquisitions which have been rolling out from the professors and the pundits. I understand that the Founding Fathers, who enjoy a demigod status in the United States and whose constitution is still treated as if it were a tablet that Moses returned with from Mount Sinai, wanted to protect the rights of the states. Less nobly, they designed the electoral college as a filter against the possibility that the vulgar masses might do something wild. Remember, this system was constructed in 1787, a time when you would be marked as a lunatic for suggesting that women should have the vote, never mind blacks. Even so, the intention of the Founding Fathers never seems to have been to deny office to the man who had won and confer power on the man who had lost. That is the perverse outcome that threatens to happen in the United States. Should George Bush be awarded the 25 electoral college votes of Florida - and he gets every one of those votes, however close and contested the result in that state - then he will have a majority in the national electoral college even though he lacks a majority from the people. It is highly suspect whether he even deserves to carry the votes of the Sunshine State. Bad smells are wafting from the Florida swamps. Thanks to a ballot paper which was an eyesight test cum brainteaser, thousands of votes in Palm Beach County, almost certainly more than enough to make the difference, were either spoilt or accidentally cast for Pat Buchanan. That Hitler-admiring right-winger cheerfully says that he got votes from elderly liberal Jews that were meant for Al Gore. The real and present danger for Americans is that they will be landed with a President whom the majority did not want as a result of rotten ballots in a crucial state and a malfunctioning mechanism giving the first prize to the runner-up. There are those who say that, however eccentric and perilous its effects, the letter of a constitution must always be followed. This misses the bigger picture. The most important element of any constitution is its spirit. And the animating spirit of America is supposed to be democracy. No one can exactly predict the reverberations for an advanced country of making the loser the leader. But I think it is a pretty sure guess that the consequences are all going to be bad. The shockwaves will be first felt in America itself. Government there already suffers from a crisis of legitimacy as less and less of the public can be bothered to engage with a political process that seems to mean and do nothing for huge swathes of the electorate. All the mature democracies are diseased by this. In America, it is pandemic. This election was accounted a good one because, after the tightest of races upon which the candidates blew a cool one billion dollars, they managed to attract just over half of the potential electorate to a polling station. If the result is to give the White House to the man who came second, the payback from the voters is not hard to imagine. Greater still will be bitter cynicism about the system, and angry alienation from it. George Bush will be an unPresident. This will be a woeful outcome for the cause of democracy in the rest of the world. America is not the paragon republic of its self-conceit. The shining city on the hill is built on quagmires of corruption and besmirched with special interests. For all that, America has had a better idea of freedom and justice than most other nations for most of history. The enemies of liberty gloat already. Those to whom America preached the virtues of democracy are returning the sermons to sender. The foreign minister of Cuba, making delicious mischief at the expense of those who have long lectured the Castro regime about its abuses, says he will send observers to the Florida count. A similar suggestion comes from that byword for human rights, Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe. Vladimir Putin, the old KGB hand, makes a sarcastic offer of Russian assistance in conducting elections. The Moscow method is to choose the President before they have the vote. We are now just waiting for Baghdad to dispatch to Washington a team of independent Iraqi scrutineers. This isn't fair on America, but it is inevitable. If George Bush becomes President, he will be seen to have seized the position on the back of a murky vote in a state governed by his brother. The truth may be more complex, but that is how it will look in the eyes of the world. President Dubya will be barren of legitimacy at home and devoid of moral authority abroad. The Saddam Husseins of the planet, every petty, vicious dictator around the world, will scoff in the face of America. Anyone who cares about the wider cause of democracy has to hope that the United States can find an exit off this freeway to disaster. Fortunately, their arrangements do provide time to untangle the impasse. Talk of a constitutional crisis, talk of America without a President, talk promoted by the acolytes of George Bush to bounce Al Gore into surrendering his claim to the White House - all that talk is specious. America has a President. Bill Clinton remains Chief Executive until the date when he is scheduled to hand the seals of power to his successor. That date is 20 January, more than two months away. Resolution could come within a week if the votes from overseas put Florida into the Vice-President's column. In the event they don't, Gore should fight on. He has a right to challenge the dodgy balloting in the state, as have those who were cheated of their choice. I'd say he has more than a right. He has a duty. For the contest to go to court, perhaps all the way to the Supreme Court, will not be edifying. It would, though, be an appropriate denouement for the most litigious nation on Earth. There is an alternative and more elevated way out of this mayhem which is both consistent with the will of the people and the oddities of the US constitution.

      "body": "<p>\"America,\" said George W. Bush in the garden of his Governor\"s mansion in Austin, Texas, last Wednesday afternoon, \"has a long tradition of uniting once elections are over.\" He promised that an administration led by him would \"reach out\" to \"supporters of Al Gore\", as part of his much-vaunted pledge to \"put an end to partisanship\" in Washington.</p> <p>But everyone knows that his victory in this election (and the hegemony of his party in both the Senate and the House) would be a sticking plaster which barely conceals a bitterly and evenly divided nation. There is a glaring abyss between rival campaign programmes from ideas on social security and healthcare to education and foreign policy with little room for compromise between a tax-cut policy - Bush\"s - that sets aside $1.3 trillion (of which 43 per cent goes to the top one per cent of earners earning more than $319,000 a year) and its rival - Gore\"s - worth a third of that, which gives no tax break to anyone earning more than $100,000. But the rift over policies masks others that run far deeper.</p> <p>The map of election results, county by county, is stark and astonishing: great tranches of Republican blue across what appears to be the entire country, punctuated by streaks and patches of Democrat red. And yet Gore won the popular vote.</p> <p>America is divided between concrete and either farmland or wilderness. Where voters are packed into cities, they are Democrats; where they live on or close to the land, they are Republican. Gore won the popular vote by taking three coastal states by vast majorities - New York by 1.5 million, California by 1.2 million and New Jersey by 400,000. He also split the big-city suburbs with the Republicans - unusually for a Democrat candidate.</p> <p>Voters in cities with populations greater than half a million handed Gore a landslide of 71 per cent to 25; urban areas between 50,000 and 500,000 favoured him by three votes to two. Meanwhile, six in every ten voters living in small towns under 50,000 opted for Bush. Voters living in rural areas voted for Bush by a ratio of seven to one; the only exceptions were those populated by huge majorities of black or Hispanic voters (the Mississippi Delta and the border counties of Texas and Arizona), the diehard liberal Scandinavian belt across the mid-northern plains and the chic white areas of New Mexico.</p> <p>The suburbs were evenly contested territory, usually reflecting the size of the urban areas they serve (small-town suburbs voting for Bush, big-city suburbs for Gore). Chicago was a tiny speck of Democrat red surrounded by hard, conservative suburbs. The election was the first fought on an entirely new American map, in which huge swaths of new \"Major Metro\" areas swung some states for the Democrats that were once contested or even Republican, while former bastions of rural and small-town liberalism turned to the right.</p> <p>Bush\"s father won 61 per cent of knife-edge Florida in 1988, which now hangs on fewer voters than it takes to fill an aeroplane. New Jersey, once a key \"swing\" state, went safely to Gore. California, once Ronald Reagan\"s state, was the banker on which Gore depended to keep his hopes alive. These are states of urban and suburban sprawl where issues such as abortion choice and gun control are popular among the \"waitress Moms\" and their families.</p> <p>Meanwhile Gore had to fight hard for rural states easily won by Democrat Michael Dukakis in 1988 - Iowa and Minnesota - and suffered the humiliation of losing a crucial handful of Democrat strongholds won by Bill Clinton: the President\"s home state of Arkansas, Ohio, Arizona, Missouri, West Virginia and, probably, Oregon.</p> <p>The phenomenon was most painfully illustrated by the loss of Gore's home-farm state of Tennessee - for which both he and his father were Senators - and with it the 11 electoral college seats that would have won him the presidency without Florida.</p> <p>These are no longer rural states in which voters are loyal to the immigrant values of their grandparents; they are church-going, gun-loving states, hostile to government and regulation, independent and bloody-minded, and they were morally offended by the Clinton administration. With the two demographic groups now evenly numbered, sociologists are trying to establish which has peaked - and tend to agree on bad news for the Democrats. Gore won only a quarter as many counties as Bush, with indications that populations are growing in Gore counties by an average of five per cent over the past decade, while those in Bush counties are increasing by 14 per cent, as immigrants move into the cities while \"natives\" move out in search of better housing.</p> <p>America is further divided between Venus and Mars. \"If men alone had voted,\" said Patricia Ireland, director of the National Organisation of Women, \"Bush would have won the presidency hands down.\" Bush is, indeed, the President of men (with 54 per cent against 42 for Gore) and Gore of women (52 per cent as opposed to 43 for Bush). The total, combined voting gap is 21 per cent; never before has there been such a dichotomy between the male and female vote. The right-wing commentator Chris Matthews described (in mocking terms) the Democrat party as the \"Mommy party\" and the Republicans as the \"Daddy party\" - and he is objectively right. Gore\"s policies this election engaged with (and were tailored to engage with) the concerns of women who are more likely than men to be what the Americans call \"care givers\" to the young and elderly, and who believe that their dependants may one day need the government safety net.</p> <p>Women respondents at the exit polls gave policy priorities which dovetailed into Gore\"s programmes for healthcare, prescription subsidies and social security pensions, as well as the traditional womens\" priorities of public education and abortion. Women too, as shown by the summer\"s \"Million Mom March\", are staunchly in favour of gun controls. Bush\"s policies, meanwhile, appealed to traditionally \"male\" values. He used the mantra \"personal responsibility\" to underwrite a planned social security system with an enhanced role for the private sector, market-oriented medical and prescription coverage and an education policy that subsidises private school places.</p> <p>The gender gap becomes complicated, however, when men and women are grouped by other defining characteristics such as race and work status. Bush narrowly carried the white female vote, by 49 to 48 per cent, and comfortably won the support of women who do not work outside their own home, by 52 per cent to 44.</p> <p>The factors behind these shifts combine geography and race - the latter, now more than ever, a political dividing line. African-Americans account for some 10 per cent of the electorate, but only 10-18 per cent of them vote. This year, the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People and Jesse Jackson embarked on a campaign to rectify this pitifully low turnout - to significant effect. Before the election, a poll by the Zogby organisation found 70 per cent of blacks planning to vote for Gore, while 17 per cent said they would vote Bush. In the event, 90 per cent of the black vote went to Gore - and in places where it mattered.</p> <p>In Florida, the black vote totals 13 per cent, 10 per cent of whom turned out to vote in 1996. This year, that figure jumped to 16 per cent. In another state targeted by the NAACP, Missouri, the black turnout increased from 5 per cent in 1996 to 12 per cent - even though the state went to Bush.</p> <p>In New York, which has the highest black population in the US, the turnout lifted from nine to 11 per cent, crucial to Hillary Clinton\"s success but to little effect for Gore. In Tennessee, the black vote soared from 13 to 20 per cent - almost all of it Democrat, but not enough to rescue Gore. Hispanic voters, constituting 7 per cent of the electorate, up on five from 1996, went to the polls in record high numbers. But the effect was muted, since about 75 per cent of the Hispanic vote is cast in two states, Texas and California.</p> <p>In the end, the ethnic map reads: 52 per cent of whites voted for Bush, 42 for Gore; 33 per cent of Hispanics for Bush, 62 for Gore; 38 per cent of Asians for Bush, 57 for Gore.</p> <p>The income map is complicated and the only one that does not show a fundamental rift between the candidates. Of those earning under $15,000, 58 per cent voted for Gore, only 37 for Bush. The solid middle class (between $30,000 to $49,000) also backed Gore, by 49 per cent to 37. But the lower middle class ($15,000 to $29,000) backed Bush by 53 per cent to 41. Above $50,000, Bush voters beat Gore voters, but only by between three and four per cent - until the magic figure of $100,000, after which 53 per cent backed Bush and 43 went for Gore.</p> <p>The cultural rift is a harder one to measure, although everyone knows what it means - the end of the \"Clinton era\" in which a certain approach to moral issues had its time in the White House. Al Gore was of course at pains to create as great a distance from the Lewinsky scandal as his opponent, but apparently failed to convince a crucial slice of the electorate for whom the scandal was an important, and prohibitive, factor.</p> <p>In election terms, \"Clinton values\" are no more than a metaphor for specific behaviour aligning with one party rather than another. Exit polls showed Bush as the champion of people who go to church at least once a week, and who think it is more important that a President be a \"moral leader\" than a \"good government manager\".</p> <p>These views form part of an increasingly congealed, job-lot package of \"traditional\" values in American society, whereby there is almost a chain reaction between apparently separate issues: firebrand religious observance, pride in the right to bear arms without a child-proof lock, opposition to abortion and gay marriage and hostility towards federal government and public spending.</p> <p>Gore, for all his caging of President Clinton and his own deep religious faith (as well as the appointment of prime moralist Joe Lieberman), failed to court the self-consciously \"moral\" constituency, tied as it was to the accompanying baggage.</p> <p>He did, however, score well among those whom the conservatives regard as standard bearers for Sodom and Gomorrah: pro-choice women, gays, those who rarely or never attend church. The exception to this pattern was Gore\"s overwhelming support among Jews and black churchgoers; Catholics (which in America usually means Hispanic, Irish, Italian or Polish) were split between the candidates, with a majority for Gore, despite his position on abortion.</p> <p>This group has its own \"liberal\" chain reaction, which entails support for stricter gun laws, belief in the notion of government as benign, that a bad public school should be fixed rather than its children encouraged to move to private schools, and - according to the wording of some exit polls - \"caring about people like me\". Among this group the priority for a President is \"competence to handle complex issues\".</p> <p>Despite criticism - not least from his own party chairman - that Gore had erred in cutting the President out of his campaign, the statistics on the great moral divide seem to prove him right.

      "bodyText": "\"America,\" said George W. Bush in the garden of his Governor\"s mansion in Austin, Texas, last Wednesday afternoon, \"has a long tradition of uniting once elections are over.\" He promised that an administration led by him would \"reach out\" to \"supporters of Al Gore\", as part of his much-vaunted pledge to \"put an end to partisanship\" in Washington. But everyone knows that his victory in this election (and the hegemony of his party in both the Senate and the House) would be a sticking plaster which barely conceals a bitterly and evenly divided nation. There is a glaring abyss between rival campaign programmes from ideas on social security and healthcare to education and foreign policy with little room for compromise between a tax-cut policy - Bush\"s - that sets aside $1.3 trillion (of which 43 per cent goes to the top one per cent of earners earning more than $319,000 a year) and its rival - Gore\"s - worth a third of that, which gives no tax break to anyone earning more than $100,000. But the rift over policies masks others that run far deeper. The map of election results, county by county, is stark and astonishing: great tranches of Republican blue across what appears to be the entire country, punctuated by streaks and patches of Democrat red. And yet Gore won the popular vote. America is divided between concrete and either farmland or wilderness. Where voters are packed into cities, they are Democrats; where they live on or close to the land, they are Republican. Gore won the popular vote by taking three coastal states by vast majorities - New York by 1.5 million, California by 1.2 million and New Jersey by 400,000. He also split the big-city suburbs with the Republicans - unusually for a Democrat candidate. Voters in cities with populations greater than half a million handed Gore a landslide of 71 per cent to 25; urban areas between 50,000 and 500,000 favoured him by three votes to two. Meanwhile, six in every ten voters living in small towns under 50,000 opted for Bush. Voters living in rural areas voted for Bush by a ratio of seven to one; the only exceptions were those populated by huge majorities of black or Hispanic voters (the Mississippi Delta and the border counties of Texas and Arizona), the diehard liberal Scandinavian belt across the mid-northern plains and the chic white areas of New Mexico. The suburbs were evenly contested territory, usually reflecting the size of the urban areas they serve (small-town suburbs voting for Bush, big-city suburbs for Gore). Chicago was a tiny speck of Democrat red surrounded by hard, conservative suburbs. The election was the first fought on an entirely new American map, in which huge swaths of new \"Major Metro\" areas swung some states for the Democrats that were once contested or even Republican, while former bastions of rural and small-town liberalism turned to the right. Bush\"s father won 61 per cent of knife-edge Florida in 1988, which now hangs on fewer voters than it takes to fill an aeroplane. New Jersey, once a key \"swing\" state, went safely to Gore. California, once Ronald Reagan\"s state, was the banker on which Gore depended to keep his hopes alive. These are states of urban and suburban sprawl where issues such as abortion choice and gun control are popular among the \"waitress Moms\" and their families. Meanwhile Gore had to fight hard for rural states easily won by Democrat Michael Dukakis in 1988 - Iowa and Minnesota - and suffered the humiliation of losing a crucial handful of Democrat strongholds won by Bill Clinton: the President\"s home state of Arkansas, Ohio, Arizona, Missouri, West Virginia and, probably, Oregon. The phenomenon was most painfully illustrated by the loss of Gore's home-farm state of Tennessee - for which both he and his father were Senators - and with it the 11 electoral college seats that would have won him the presidency without Florida. These are no longer rural states in which voters are loyal to the immigrant values of their grandparents; they are church-going, gun-loving states, hostile to government and regulation, independent and bloody-minded, and they were morally offended by the Clinton administration. With the two demographic groups now evenly numbered, sociologists are trying to establish which has peaked - and tend to agree on bad news for the Democrats. Gore won only a quarter as many counties as Bush, with indications that populations are growing in Gore counties by an average of five per cent over the past decade, while those in Bush counties are increasing by 14 per cent, as immigrants move into the cities while \"natives\" move out in search of better housing. America is further divided between Venus and Mars. \"If men alone had voted,\" said Patricia Ireland, director of the National Organisation of Women, \"Bush would have won the presidency hands down.\" Bush is, indeed, the President of men (with 54 per cent against 42 for Gore) and Gore of women (52 per cent as opposed to 43 for Bush). The total, combined voting gap is 21 per cent; never before has there been such a dichotomy between the male and female vote. The right-wing commentator Chris Matthews described (in mocking terms) the Democrat party as the \"Mommy party\" and the Republicans as the \"Daddy party\" - and he is objectively right. Gore\"s policies this election engaged with (and were tailored to engage with) the concerns of women who are more likely than men to be what the Americans call \"care givers\" to the young and elderly, and who believe that their dependants may one day need the government safety net. Women respondents at the exit polls gave policy priorities which dovetailed into Gore\"s programmes for healthcare, prescription subsidies and social security pensions, as well as the traditional womens\" priorities of public education and abortion.

William Hague, attempting reverse engineering, has tried to rebuild the Tories with body parts donated by the Republicans.

It will look less like an era, and more like a brief interruption of right-wing rule, if the Democrats lose the White House. One of the Prime Minister's closest advisers, speaking to me from Washington, expressed the combination of anger and distress common among Blairites. 'No one can be sure, but you've got to think that Bush is going to be President. It's deeply shocking.

In the long term, a Bush Presidency could usefully goad Europe to take proper responsibility for its own backyard. In the short term, American disengagement is alarming, not least to the British. Bush's determination to press ahead with an anti-missile umbrella for the United States, an enthusiasm not shared by Gore, would present the Government with a choice that it would prefer not to make. Providing British facilities for the system will be inflammatory within the Labour Party and set Britain against many of its European partners.</p> <p>Blair likes to portray Britain - and himself - as 'the bridge' across the Atlantic. Bridging a social democratic Europe and a Republican American would stretch even this Prime Minister's legendary suppleness to the limit. As the world waits for the identity of the next US President, few are monitoring developments more anxiously than Blair. When he is finally in a position to make that congratulatory call, the Prime Minister clings to the hope that he might yet be dialling Al Gore while fearing that next time he really will have to pick up the phone to George W. Bush.</p>",

In the long term, a Bush Presidency could usefully goad Europe to take proper responsibility for its own backyard. In the short term, American disengagement is alarming, not least to the British. Bush's determination to press ahead with an anti-missile umbrella for the United States, an enthusiasm not shared by Gore, would present the Government with a choice that it would prefer not to make. Providing British facilities for the system will be inflammatory within the Labour Party and set Britain against many of its European partners. Blair likes to portray Britain - and himself - as 'the bridge' across the Atlantic. Bridging a social democratic Europe and a Republican American would stretch even this Prime Minister's legendary suppleness to the limit. As the world waits for the identity of the next US President, few are monitoring developments more anxiously than Blair. When he is finally in a position to make that congratulatory call, the Prime Minister clings to the hope that he might yet be dialling Al Gore while fearing that next time he really will have to pick up the phone to George W. Bush.",

      "body": "<p>On the night of 7 November, 1876, the chairman of the Republican Party, one Zack Chandler, retired to his bed at the Fifth Avenue hotel in New York bitterly disappointed. He believed that the Democratic candidate, a New York millionaire called Samuel Tilden, had been elected President.</p> <p>Some time after midnight, however, the Democrats sent a message to the New York Times, then a partisan Republican paper, to check its record of the vote. Alerted to the possibility of discrepancies, the paper's editor, John Reed, hurried round to the Fifth Avenue hotel.</p> <p>There, in the middle of the night, he roused Chandler and persuaded him that the Democratic victories in Louisiana, South Carolina and Florida could be challenged. At the crack of dawn, emissaries were packed off by train, well-furnished, a contemporary recorded, with \"the sinews of war\": money.</p> <p>In due course, with the help of money and legal challenges, the \"carpetbagger\" Republican regimes in the South, installed by the Union army a dozen years earlier, succeeded in overturning the Democrat victories in those three states.</p> <p>The election was thrown into doubt. After three months of legal wrangles and political intrigue (Presidents were not inaugurated until March in those days) the election was finally decided by a partisan vote in the House of Representatives.</p> <p>At the last possible moment before the inauguration, the House voted 184 for Tilden, 185 for Rutherford B. Hayes, the Republican, who duly became the President of the United States, widely known as \"Rutherfraud\". Even in those days, the journalists and the lawyers had parts to play in operating the complex rigidities of the constitutional mechanism.</p> <p>Even then, money counted for a good deal. But the most relevant lesson of 1876 is perhaps that, once the result enters the dark realm of serious doubt, it can be a long and politically dangerous business to resolve it.</p> <p>There are at least three stages that a challenge by Al Gore and his advisers to George W. Bush's apparent victory must go through. The first is a legal challenge in individual Florida counties, most promisingly in Palm Beach.</p> <p>It is possible, but on balance not likely, that they will succeed. The situation would then be further confused by the absentee ballots, which may or may not go in the main to Bush.</p> <p>Next there is the Electoral College. Most Americans assume the President is elected by the popular vote. In fact, he is elected by the Electoral College. This eighteenth-century device reflects the \"Great Compromise\" negotiated by the framers [of the Constitution] between big and small states.</p> <p>Each state sends a number of electors to the college corresponding to its two senators (reflecting the state's quasi-sovereign nature), and the number of its representatives, reflecting its population.</p> <p>So delegates can run from three (two senators and a single congressman), for half a dozen small states with fewer people than many English counties, to 54 for California with its 38 million people.</p> <p>However narrow the margin in the popular vote in any individual state, the state's whole tally in the college is supposed to go to the winner.</p> <p>If he holds off the Florida challenges, Bush would win with 270 votes in the college unless more than a single college member were, as the phrase goes, \"faithless\". And in fact a certain number of electors in comparatively recent times have switched, as a Richard Nixon elector switched to George Wallace in 1968 and in 1976 a Gerald Ford elector switched to Ronald Reagan, then a \"write-in\" candidate.</p> <p>Some states, however, enforce the electors' mandate, and a federal statute gives Congress the right to reject a vote not \"regularly given\". Arguably, if Gore proves to have won the popular vote, more than one elector might feel obliged to reflect the popular plurality.</p> <p>If that happened, it would trigger a mountainous constitutional and legal, as well as political, row. If, for whatever reason, the Electoral College were to fail to come up with a decisive result, then, as in 1876, the issue would go to the House of Representatives, that is, to the new House, in which the Republican majority is down to 10, with two independents and one seat undecided.</p> <p>So on the face of the constitutional rules it is unlikely, though still conceivable, that Gore could win. Politically, however, Gore could be faced with a tough decision. In 1960, there was good reason to suspect that John F. Kennedy only won the election thanks to fraud on the part of Lyndon Johnson in Texas and Mayor Richard Daley (father of Gore's campaign manager this year) in Chicago.</p> <p>However Nixon, the loser, decided not to challenge the result. In his memoirs, Nixon claimed that he did not want to bring the presidency into disrepute in the tense Cold War climate of the time.</p> <p>He probably also calculated that it would be bad for his own career to look like a bad loser. Gore has a similar calculation to make. Probably he has already decided to press the Florida challenge but, if it fails, to concede with as good grace as he can muster - probably, but no one can be certain.</p> <p>Another factor that might influence him is that, if he were to recapture Florida, the Republicans might be tempted to reopen possible issues of irregularity in other states. That would put a number of cats among some potentially messy pigeons and would do serious damage to the already fragile reputation of the US electoral system.</p> <p>The likely upshot, therefore, is that the result of the election will not be decided in a matter of hours, but will be known in a matter of weeks, and formally determined on 6 January, when the president of the Senate officially opens the Electoral College ballots.</p> <p>Such a delay of almost two months would not be entirely cost-free. Political uncertainty could conceivably set off a more or less significant market fall. And the prestige of the presidency would suffer. How much does this near dead-heat matter? Does it reflect serious flaws in the constitutional system, or any unhealthy condition in the body politic?</p> <p>Americans themselves are debating these questions, in online chat rooms, in bars, on television and in the columns of newspapers. Does it matter? Yes, it does. It has already been difficult for some years to move major legislation through Congress, essentially because party organisation counts for less and less.</p> <p>Congressmen and senators get to Washington without much help from their party. They raise their own money and they buy their own TV spots. They are individualist and often stroppy. Only the conservative ideologues of the 1994 generation have shown much cohesion, and they fight likes cats in a sack.</p> <p>What is more, they have been seriously discredited by the impeachment fiasco. Congress\"s intractability is often put down to \"divided government\", the fact that Presidents often face majorities in Congress of the opposing party.</p> <p>If either Bush or Gore had won convincingly, congressional leadership might have become easier. As it is, we should look for few bold initiatives - except perhaps on campaign finance and even electoral reform.</p> <p>Specifically, there will be voices calling for abolition of the Electoral College. With that exception, it is most unlikely that many Americans will see the election as making a case for any major constitutional reform.</p> <p>Indeed, it has been striking over the past couple of days how many politicians and officials, on television, in the very act of admitting irregularities in the working of the system, go out of their way to assert the superiority of American democracy.</p> <p>An eighteenth-century Constitution may have shortcomings in the twenty-first century. But few Americans are willing to say so. Hardest of all to say is whether the election result reflects any broad distemper in the political system.</p> <p>Many years ago Robert Kennedy pulled a stack of dog-eared three-by-five cards out of the bottom drawer of his desk to buttress his argument to me that America was so divided geographically and ethnically that it could not tolerate a party system that was also divided by class, like the politics of most European countries.</p> <p>Yet something like that is exactly what has happened. Before the civil rights movement of the Sixties, American party allegiance essentially rested on the Civil War, and on the impact of mass immigration from Eastern and Southern Europe a hundred years ago. Southern reactionaries were joined in the Democratic Party with Northern workers and liberals.</p> <p>The effect of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has been to turn the South, for the first time, into a two-party system. Southern conservatives turned into Republicans, and in the process they turned the Republican Party into the conservative party of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan, while the Democrats, shorn of much of the Southern white vote, became the liberal party.</p> <p>Yet politicians, needing to raise money from special interest groups because they depend on paid television ads to be elected, are nervous about offending business, and so they stick to the centre.</p> <p>Voters are increasingly frustrated. Half the electorate is angry that the conservative revolution initiated by Ronald Reagan has been stopped in its tracks. The other half resents the dominance of corporate business. This does not explain the statistical stasis of the 2000 elections. But it does help to explain the new mood of bitterness and intransigence that will make it hard to resolve the dead-heat.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Al Gore's limousine was pulling up at the War Memorial plaza in Nashville in the early hours of a sodden Wednesday morning, the Vice-President of the United States braced for the worst moment of his political life.</p> <p>A few thousand soaked supporters were gathered to cheer him, as best they could, through his public concession of defeat to the man who had just stolen Gore's lifelong dream, his election rival George W. Bush.</p> <p>Gore had already placed the call to Bush at the Governor's mansion in Texas, and now he had to tell the world in a short and, he was determined, gracious speech . As the limo braked, a Skytel pager belonging to an aide, Michael Feldman, vibrated in another car, several vehicles behind in the Gore motorcade.</p> <p>The message told Feldman to call Michael Whouley, a leading campaign strategist monitoring returns in Florida. Florida had caused enough tribulation for everyone already that night, thanks to a series of gaffes by the mass media, and the willingness of the real world of politics to go along with them.</p> <p>Indeed, all the emotional agony and ecstasy of the night so far among the electorate, the rival camps and even the candidates themselves had been in response not to hard-and-fast results, but to phantasmagoria, to media predictions based on scanty 'exit polls'. Florida had initially been called for Gore, sending his camp into premature celebration as a juggernaut of Democrat red apparently set out westwards across the map of America.</p> <p>Some aides were so heartened they went to get dinner in the steakhouse at the Lowes Hotel, where they could not watch television. Then to the media's shame Florida was withdrawn, undeclared.</p> <p>The withdrawal detonated a sudden surge of state victories for Bush, and a surge of blue across the map. And at 1.12am Central Time, the crucial state had been conclusively called (by those same TV networks) for Bush. At 1.20, Gore's campaign manager Donna Brazile had sent him a message on his Blackberry pager: 'Never surrender' but Gore was too downcast to give it credence; there was nothing for it but to make the speech.</p> <p>Feldman returned Whouley's message, to be told that the Florida Secretary of State's web page indicated that Bush, rather that winning the state by a 15,000 majority, led by only 5,000 votes, with precincts still to count.</p> <p>And there was a message from Bill Daley, Gore's heavy-hitting campaign manager: 'Don't let him concede. It's not over yet. 'Five minutes later, Gore was on the telephone to Austin for a second time that night. 'Circumstances,' he said, once through to the Governor of Texas, 'have changed. I need to withdraw my concession until the situation is clear'. 'Let me make sure I understand, Mr Vice-President,' said Bush. 'You're calling me back to retract your concession'. 'There's no need to get snippy about it,' said Gore. Bush replied that his brother Jeb was the Governor in charge of the Florida ballot. Gore's voice retorted: 'It may surprise you but your younger brother is not the ultimate authority on this.' 'Mr Vice-President,' said Bush\u00cds voice, 'You need to do what you have to do.'</p> <p>At 6pm that evening, the Bush family had sat down to a dinner of parmesan-crusted chicken in a private dining room at the campaign\u00cds informal headquarters, the Shoreline Grill and Bar at the Four Seasons Hotel on a bend in the slow-rolling Colorado River.</p> <p>It was a grey, damp evening, perfect for the heron which glide across the river reaches at the foot of the sweeping sawgrass lawn down which the Texas governor looked as he ate. While his rival had spent a punishing 30 hours campaigning without sleep, Bush had taken Sunday off, and was full of beans.</p> <p>His campaign aides had told him privately they expected him to win 320 electoral college seats 50 more than required. Father George and mother Barbara had come to join him for the big night, as had brother Jeb whose Florida state Bush Snr had carried in his elections of 1988 and 1992.</p> <p>Apparently George almost choked on his steak when the CBS punditocracy called Florida for Gore. Jeb got up from his seat, walked over to his brother, hugged him and said, in tears: 'I'm sorry.' Then he left the room. The dinner broke up, Bush retiring with and his wife Laura and his parents but no Jeb to the Governor's mansion.</p> <p>A proposed gathering with selected guests was cancelled. Some 20 minutes later, Bush allowed in the cameras to show his drawn, stunned face. Meanwhile, on the ninth floor of the Four Seasons, 'you could hear a pin drop', says one aide. O</p> <p>Only Karl Rove, Bush's indefatigable campaign strategist, was buoyant; he immediately spotted problems with the media forecast, and telephoned them to say so. An hour later, the Florida prediction was indeed withdrawn. And shortly after 1.10am Texas time, the networks delivered it the other way.</p> <p>Again, based on nothing more than the word of television, the street party began outside the hotel and pink marble statehouse. The phone rang shortly afterwards: it was Al Gore, conceding defeat. Dubya was just preparing to go to bed, thinking he was President of the United States, when it rang again.</p> <p>'Circumstances have changed,' said the voice on the other end. Despite the call, campaign chairman Don Wilson went to address the crowds: 'We believe we have elected the next President of the United States'. Dubya went to bed at 3.30, and when he awoke, he went downstairs, fed the cats and made Laura her coffee, as usual.</p> <p>He had a bit of a chat with one of the cats. Bush said: 'She understood.' 'I've been in politics a long time,' he said on Thursday, 'but I don't think I've had a night like this one.' The Bush brigade, albeit not the family, have since been re-visiting the Shoreline Grill, prowling the carpet and hotel reception like palace guards ready to fend off a coup d'etat.</p> <p>Be it brazen confidence or bluster the Bush entourage of Austin isready to assume power. On Friday, when Bush made his first appearance for 48 hours, the strain of the strange week was obvious. His eyes were tired, his speech was halting and faint.</p> <p>Sitting near him were Dick Cheney, his would-be Vice-President, and Andrew Card, the likely Chief of Staff in a Bush White House. Both were to meet him at his ranch near Waco over the weekend. Bush said: 'I am mindful that there are still votes to be counted.' But he added: 'I think it's up to us to prepare the groundwork for an administration that will be ready to function on day one.' Outside the mansion, a group of protesters drew attention to what Democrats have claimed were irregularities in the Florida voting. Bush was asked what he would say to those Americans who would deem his presidency illegitimate. 'I would say we have a Constitution,' he said.</p> <p>'I will live by the Constitution. We've had two vote counts already, and I'm pleased with what's happened.' Bush seemed utterly spent and got confused about the name of a reporter whom he knew well. There was a large adhesive bandage on his cheek, covering what his campaign's communications director, Karen Hughes, said was a boil-like infection but not serious.</p> <p>Bush stopped short of announcing Cabinet appointments or staging any sort of celebration. 'We're taking our time,' he said. We're in a very low-key manner.' But low-keyed or not, the entourage of Austin is poised to make the move to Washington.</p> <p>Comparisons with Bill Clinton's Little Rock are irresistible. Clinton was despised by a large slice of his state capital, by the lifelong Republicans and racists who would hound him for his eight years of office, to dramatic effect.</p> <p>Bush is similarly isolated within Austin, which is an anomaly in Texas, a liberal university town with its famous and historic Sixth Street, now home to neo-grunge rock.</p> <p>But as with Clinton, there is also a considerable segment of the population who think they know Dubya as a friend, and as with Clinton, a little empire has built up around him. Only there the comparison ends, for in Austin (and in its main power base of Houston, down the road) there is a big difference: family.</p> <p>The Bushes operate as a dynasty, its enemies use the 'M' word, with George Bush Snr as the Godfather. Every step of the way, in business and in politics, for all his cocaine frat-brat boozing, Vietnam draft-dodging and drunken driving,the son\u00cds fortunes have been nurtured by the former President.</p> <p>Austin is full of recollections of how Dubya's early ventures into his father's business, oil, were invariably bailed out of disaster by friends of the then Senator Bush, tycoons eager for influence with the older man heading for the White House.</p> <p>It was friends of George Bush Snr who opened the floodgates of money through which this most expensive campaign in all history first surged. President Bush the First has been the silent senior partner guiding his son\u00cds progress.</p> <p>He bequeathed him running mate Dick Cheney (a close member of the big oil cabal) and often consulted directly with the man last week busily motorcading to and fro under Austin\u00cds blue sky, the Merlin behind Dubya's victory if there is one: Karl Rove. Rove is the man who is meeting rock with rock against Gore\u00cds challenge.</p> <p>'In America,' he said on Thursday, 'we vote on election day. We do not go on re-voting and re-counting until we get the result Al Gore wants.' Rove is the man who has devised a strategy which could turn the election's denouement into a never-ending tit-for-tat, telling journalists on Friday he would counter the recount in Florida with demands for the same in Iowa and Wisconsin, where Gore's lead is between 5-6,000.</p> <p>In New Mexico, Rove did not have to bother, Governor Gary Johnson announced on Friday night that the race in his state, declared by the media for Gore, would recount and could go either way by one vote.</p> <p>A recount was also probable in Oregon. Rove knows the Four Seasons, and many others, well. He has run almost every Republican campaign in Texas for 20 years from here, 'bullying, bristling, laughing when he really has to', one insider told The Observer. He has known Bush for all those 20 years, but still calls him Sir.</p> <p>Now Rove waits to become the backstage Svengali, the George Stephanopoulos of the next White House. Rove's finest hour, they say on the Austin grapevine (and he has never denied it), came when he assumed a false identity to break into the Democrats' Illinois headquarters in 1970 in order to steal letterheads to print invitations to a binge featuring 'free beer, free food, girls and a good time for nothing'.</p> <p>Rove learnt his craft from Lee Atwater, the strategist who put Dubya's father in the White House. Commuting like a relay runner last week between the Governor\u00cds mansion, the Shoreline Grill, the State Capitol and the bar at the Driskill Hotel was the huge frame of Joe Allbaugh.</p> <p>'It's a flat top,' he says of his hair, which he wears in a military buzz, 'not a crew cut'. A rare and obligatory display of bombast from the usually press-shy Allbaugh, caught in the Driskill bar. He is, they say, privately dreading the glare of Washington. An 'Okie', he has been Bush's chief of staff, enforcing the Governor's will as effectively as he hopes to brand that of the next President, 'I'm the heavy,' he says, 'in the literal sense of the word'.</p> <p>The third side of the Austin 'iron triangle' is Karen Hughes, now hoarse from speaking for her boss and confidant. Hughes, an army brat born in Paris, started the campaign looking like a sprightly businesswoman on springs but has ended up by perfecting her apparatchik's robotic strut.</p> <p>And no wonder: this has been one of the most tightly managed political campaigns ever, as would be the Presidency, no paper bags on heads when she takes the White House podium. It's even said in Austin that Bush said to Hughes: 'If you're not running, 'I'm not running.' The whisper in Austin is that she and Rove do not get on, requiring frequent umpiring by Allbaugh.</p> <p>Don Evans, the campaign chairman, is the scary one: cold-eyed, hard-faced and slipping behind the curtain before anyone has time to ask the questions he will not answer about anything other than the fact that he filled the biggest election coffers of all time.</p> <p>Unlike Bush, these people owe nothing to rhetoric about 'uniting America'. As they prepare to run the White House, they owe nothing to consensus politics and have no investments anywhere other than in hard, Conservative politics as practised in the state of Texas, under the man who now seeks to elevate the values and subjects of his fiefdom to the national plane.</p> <p>For three days after Tuesday's vote, and the dramatic 3am drive to give the concession speech that wasn't, Gore stewed in the ninth floor Swan suite of Loews hotel in downtown Nashville. It was an ignominious fate: after nearly two years of campaigning and the exhausting final cross-country push, Gore and his family were virtual prisoners in a hotel ringed by the world's media in a state that he calls home but had turned against him and voted Republican.</p> <p>Aides said he spent the days on the telephone and watching news broadcasts like everyone else. In the bars and honky-tonks of Nashville, few had sympathy for their native son. 'He was an idiot,' remarked one man. 'If he hadn't lost Tennessee he would have won the election.</p> <p>And he lost because he didn't campaign here and he wouldn't let Clinton off the leash to campaign for him.' Only once did he face the press, preferring instead to direct his aides and a gathering army of lawyers into a total war of spin and counter-spin over the Florida vote unseen.</p> <p>The decision to withdraw and let others, including former Secretary of State Warren Christopher and aggrieved West Palm Beach voters, fight his battle was calculated to avoid risking the appearance that he\u00cds not abiding by the rules of the game.</p> <p>But while maintaining that as winner of the popular vote he should be President, Gore may have lost precious time in failing to counteract Bush's presumption of winning office by setting up transition teams. Asked how long the Vice-President would explore avenues to establish that he won Florida, one adviser said: \u00efHow can you put a deadline on democracy?'</p> <p>Before abandoning Nashville for his home in Washington on Thursday, Gore went out for a jog with his daughters, Kristin and Kareena.</p> <p>When a reporter asked him whether he had won the election, Gore ducked the question, saying only: 'We're having a great run here, thank you.' When he travelled from Nashville to Washington on Friday, he did not make any public comments but allowed television cameras to film him and his family playing touch football in the grounds of the Vice-President's house.</p> <p>His aides insisted they were adamant in their resolve to make sure that there were not flaws in the voting process. Daley said: 'I hope that our friends in the Bush campaign will join us in our efforts to get the fairest and most accurate vote count here in Florida.'</p> <p>There is little chance of such amity. Indeed, Gore was coming under intense pressure to concede in the interests of national unit and national stability. And the truth is that, in the words of the veteran commentator R. W. Apple, neither Bush nor Gore 'closed the deal' with the people of America. Al Gore not only won the popular vote but polled more votes than Bill Clinton in either of his victories in 1992 and 1996, running on a programme at least two steps to the left of Clinton, which recalled Truman or even Roosevelt more than it did his mentor's 'Third Way'.</p> <p>Conversely, although Bush's packaging managed to file down the sharp edges of his ideological parcel, its ultra-conservative kernel was unmistakable. He campaigned on a manifesto that was brazen in its divisiveness as his rhetoric was in its appeal to 'unite' America. Whoever assumes the highest political office in the land, he represents his half only, his half of a nation divided. Divided more evenly and, at the and of this week more bitterly, than any American can remember, politically, culturally, demographically, racially and in terms of gender.</p> <p>There seems little doubt that the celebrated 'First 100 Days, by which incoming administrations are usually measured, will be a matter of bluster by the new President and deadlock.</p> <p>On paper, Bush enjoys a hegemony that the Republicans have not enjoyed since 1953, command of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, but the drama of last week renders that hegemony a bluff.</p> <p>It seems unreal, for the moment, that a man elected on either such a slim mandate or no mandate at all could, in Bush's case, at least 'implement tax cuts so brazenly beneficial to one section for society (in his case, the super-rich), revolutionise and privatise the social security system, assail such rights as abortion and tick off the items on a shopping list left by the National Rifle Association (NRA). But Bush, if he takes office, will owe his election to the big backers of the Republican Party who desperately wanted power at any cost.</p> <p>The oil magnates will want their return, as will the NRA. Those who reap the harvest of mass health insurance will expect a consideration, likewise the tobacco giants.</p> <p>The Christian coalition and its allies will take the narrow victory not as a signal for restraint, but as occasion to demand a reward for their priceless loyalty. Already, in Austin last week, the demeanour, the bullish retorts and combative mood of the Cabinet-in-waiting suggests that conciliation will soon pass its sell-by-date.</p> <p>The only recent election remotely comparable to this was John F. Kennedy's razor-edged victory over Richard Nixon in 1960, after which Nixon made a point of not wanting to 'put America through the pain' of a contested result and recount.</p> <p>Some moderates in Al Gore's Nashville camp, and the op-ed barons of the East Coast media, who loathe any sign of combat over what the revered Founding Fathers might have meant by democracy in America, are urging Gore to behave and concede defeat.</p> <p>But we have seen many sides to polyhedron Gore of late, and it has been a blend of two which has proved most effective (indeed, if left un-spun by his team, it might have won him the election): his tough-guy Sopranos act and his 'voice-of-experience-and-respect-for-history' act.</p> <p>When he emerged to speak during Wednesday's crisis, he did so in deep, sombre tones about his respect for the sanctity of America\u00cds democracy and its institutions, including the Electoral College. Then, behind the scenes, Gore rolled his sleeves up and, with Daley, donned his gloves to face his foe.</p> <p>Additional reporting by Ed Helmore in New York</p>",

      "bodyText": "Al Gore's limousine was pulling up at the War Memorial plaza in Nashville in the early hours of a sodden Wednesday morning, the Vice-President of the United States braced for the worst moment of his political life. A few thousand soaked supporters were gathered to cheer him, as best they could, through his public concession of defeat to the man who had just stolen Gore's lifelong dream, his election rival George W. Bush. Gore had already placed the call to Bush at the Governor's mansion in Texas, and now he had to tell the world in a short and, he was determined, gracious speech . As the limo braked, a Skytel pager belonging to an aide, Michael Feldman, vibrated in another car, several vehicles behind in the Gore motorcade. The message told Feldman to call Michael Whouley, a leading campaign strategist monitoring returns in Florida. Florida had caused enough tribulation for everyone already that night, thanks to a series of gaffes by the mass media, and the willingness of the real world of politics to go along with them. Indeed, all the emotional agony and ecstasy of the night so far among the electorate, the rival camps and even the candidates themselves had been in response not to hard-and-fast results, but to phantasmagoria, to media predictions based on scanty 'exit polls'. Florida had initially been called for Gore, sending his camp into premature celebration as a juggernaut of Democrat red apparently set out westwards across the map of America. Some aides were so heartened they went to get dinner in the steakhouse at the Lowes Hotel, where they could not watch television. Then to the media's shame Florida was withdrawn, undeclared. The withdrawal detonated a sudden surge of state victories for Bush, and a surge of blue across the map. And at 1.12am Central Time, the crucial state had been conclusively called (by those same TV networks) for Bush. At 1.20, Gore's campaign manager Donna Brazile had sent him a message on his Blackberry pager: 'Never surrender' but Gore was too downcast to give it credence; there was nothing for it but to make the speech. Feldman returned Whouley's message, to be told that the Florida Secretary of State's web page indicated that Bush, rather that winning the state by a 15,000 majority, led by only 5,000 votes, with precincts still to count. And there was a message from Bill Daley, Gore's heavy-hitting campaign manager: 'Don't let him concede. It's not over yet. 'Five minutes later, Gore was on the telephone to Austin for a second time that night. 'Circumstances,' he said, once through to the Governor of Texas, 'have changed. I need to withdraw my concession until the situation is clear'. 'Let me make sure I understand, Mr Vice-President,' said Bush. 'You're calling me back to retract your concession'. 'There's no need to get snippy about it,' said Gore. Bush replied that his brother Jeb was the Governor in charge of the Florida ballot. Gore's voice retorted: 'It may surprise you but your younger brother is not the ultimate authority on this.' 'Mr Vice-President,' said Bush\u00cds voice, 'You need to do what you have to do.' At 6pm that evening, the Bush family had sat down to a dinner of parmesan-crusted chicken in a private dining room at the campaign\u00cds informal headquarters, the Shoreline Grill and Bar at the Four Seasons Hotel on a bend in the slow-rolling Colorado River. It was a grey, damp evening, perfect for the heron which glide across the river reaches at the foot of the sweeping sawgrass lawn down which the Texas governor looked as he ate. While his rival had spent a punishing 30 hours campaigning without sleep, Bush had taken Sunday off, and was full of beans. His campaign aides had told him privately they expected him to win 320 electoral college seats 50 more than required. Father George and mother Barbara had come to join him for the big night, as had brother Jeb whose Florida state Bush Snr had carried in his elections of 1988 and 1992. Apparently George almost choked on his steak when the CBS punditocracy called Florida for Gore. Jeb got up from his seat, walked over to his brother, hugged him and said, in tears: 'I'm sorry.' Then he left the room. The dinner broke up, Bush retiring with and his wife Laura and his parents but no Jeb to the Governor's mansion. A proposed gathering with selected guests was cancelled. Some 20 minutes later, Bush allowed in the cameras to show his drawn, stunned face. Meanwhile, on the ninth floor of the Four Seasons, 'you could hear a pin drop', says one aide. O Only Karl Rove, Bush's indefatigable campaign strategist, was buoyant; he immediately spotted problems with the media forecast, and telephoned them to say so. An hour later, the Florida prediction was indeed withdrawn. And shortly after 1.10am Texas time, the networks delivered it the other way. Again, based on nothing more than the word of television, the street party began outside the hotel and pink marble statehouse. The phone rang shortly afterwards: it was Al Gore, conceding defeat. Dubya was just preparing to go to bed, thinking he was President of the United States, when it rang again. 'Circumstances have changed,' said the voice on the other end. Despite the call, campaign chairman Don Wilson went to address the crowds: 'We believe we have elected the next President of the United States'. Dubya went to bed at 3.30, and when he awoke, he went downstairs, fed the cats and made Laura her coffee, as usual. He had a bit of a chat with one of the cats. Bush said: 'She understood.' 'I've been in politics a long time,' he said on Thursday, 'but I don't think I've had a night like this one.' The Bush brigade, albeit not the family, have since been re-visiting the Shoreline Grill, prowling the carpet and hotel reception like palace guards ready to fend off a coup d'etat. Be it brazen confidence or bluster the Bush entourage of Austin isready to assume power. On Friday, when Bush made his first appearance for 48 hours, the strain of the strange week was obvious. His eyes were tired, his speech was halting and faint. Sitting near him were Dick Cheney, his would-be Vice-President, and Andrew Card, the likely Chief of Staff in a Bush White House. Both were to meet him at his ranch near Waco over the weekend. Bush said: 'I am mindful that there are still votes to be counted.' But he added: 'I think it's up to us to prepare the groundwork for an administration that will be ready to function on day one.' Outside the mansion, a group of protesters drew attention to what Democrats have claimed were irregularities in the Florida voting. Bush was asked what he would say to those Americans who would deem his presidency illegitimate. 'I would say we have a Constitution,' he said. 'I will live by the Constitution. We've had two vote counts already, and I'm pleased with what's happened.' Bush seemed utterly spent and got confused about the name of a reporter whom he knew well. There was a large adhesive bandage on his cheek, covering what his campaign's communications director, Karen Hughes, said was a boil-like infection but not serious. Bush stopped short of announcing Cabinet appointments or staging any sort of celebration. 'We're taking our time,' he said. We're in a very low-key manner.' But low-keyed or not, the entourage of Austin is poised to make the move to Washington. Comparisons with Bill Clinton's Little Rock are irresistible. Clinton was despised by a large slice of his state capital, by the lifelong Republicans and racists who would hound him for his eight years of office, to dramatic effect. Bush is similarly isolated within Austin, which is an anomaly in Texas, a liberal university town with its famous and historic Sixth Street, now home to neo-grunge rock. But as with Clinton, there is also a considerable segment of the population who think they know Dubya as a friend, and as with Clinton, a little empire has built up around him. Only there the comparison ends, for in Austin (and in its main power base of Houston, down the road) there is a big difference: family. The Bushes operate as a dynasty, its enemies use the 'M' word, with George Bush Snr as the Godfather. Every step of the way, in business and in politics, for all his cocaine frat-brat boozing, Vietnam draft-dodging and drunken driving,the son\u00cds fortunes have been nurtured by the former President. Austin is full of recollections of how Dubya's early ventures into his father's business, oil, were invariably bailed out of disaster by friends of the then Senator Bush, tycoons eager for influence with the older man heading for the White House. It was friends of George Bush Snr who opened the floodgates of money through which this most expensive campaign in all history first surged. President Bush the First has been the silent senior partner guiding his son\u00cds progress. He bequeathed him running mate Dick Cheney (a close member of the big oil cabal) and often consulted directly with the man last week busily motorcading to and fro under Austin\u00cds blue sky, the Merlin behind Dubya's victory if there is one: Karl Rove. Rove is the man who is meeting rock with rock against Gore\u00cds challenge. 'In America,' he said on Thursday, 'we vote on election day. We do not go on re-voting and re-counting until we get the result Al Gore wants.' Rove is the man who has devised a strategy which could turn the election's denouement into a never-ending tit-for-tat, telling journalists on Friday he would counter the recount in Florida with demands for the same in Iowa and Wisconsin, where Gore's lead is between 5-6,000. In New Mexico, Rove did not have to bother, Governor Gary Johnson announced on Friday night that the race in his state, declared by the media for Gore, would recount and could go either way by one vote. A recount was also probable in Oregon. Rove knows the Four Seasons, and many others, well. He has run almost every Republican campaign in Texas for 20 years from here, 'bullying, bristling, laughing when he really has to', one insider told The Observer. He has known Bush for all those 20 years, but still calls him Sir. Now Rove waits to become the backstage Svengali, the George Stephanopoulos of the next White House. Rove's finest hour, they say on the Austin grapevine (and he has never denied it), came when he assumed a false identity to break into the Democrats' Illinois headquarters in 1970 in order to steal letterheads to print invitations to a binge featuring 'free beer, free food, girls and a good time for nothing'. Rove learnt his craft from Lee Atwater, the strategist who put Dubya's father in the White House. Commuting like a relay runner last week between the Governor\u00cds mansion, the Shoreline Grill, the State Capitol and the bar at the Driskill Hotel was the huge frame of Joe Allbaugh. 'It's a flat top,' he says of his hair, which he wears in a military buzz, 'not a crew cut'. A rare and obligatory display of bombast from the usually press-shy Allbaugh, caught in the Driskill bar. He is, they say, privately dreading the glare of Washington. An 'Okie', he has been Bush's chief of staff, enforcing the Governor's will as effectively as he hopes to brand that of the next President, 'I'm the heavy,' he says, 'in the literal sense of the word'. The third side of the Austin 'iron triangle' is Karen Hughes, now hoarse from speaking for her boss and confidant.

It's even said in Austin that Bush said to Hughes: 'If you're not running, 'I'm not running.' The whisper in Austin is that she and Rove do not get on, requiring frequent umpiring by Allbaugh. Don Evans, the campaign chairman, is the scary one: cold-eyed, hard-faced and slipping behind the curtain before anyone has time to ask the questions he will not answer about anything other than the fact that he filled the biggest election coffers of all time. Unlike Bush, these people owe nothing to rhetoric about 'uniting America'. As they prepare to run the White House, they owe nothing to consensus politics and have no investments anywhere other than in hard, Conservative politics as practised in the state of Texas, under the man who now seeks to elevate the values and subjects of his fiefdom to the national plane.

Only once did he face the press, preferring instead to direct his aides and a gathering army of lawyers into a total war of spin and counter-spin over the Florida vote unseen.

There seems little doubt that the celebrated 'First 100 Days, by which incoming administrations are usually measured, will be a matter of bluster by the new President and deadlock. On paper, Bush enjoys a hegemony that the Republicans have not enjoyed since 1953, command of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, but the drama of last week renders that hegemony a bluff. It seems unreal, for the moment, that a man elected on either such a slim mandate or no mandate at all could, in Bush's case, at least 'implement tax cuts so brazenly beneficial to one section for society (in his case, the super-rich), revolutionise and privatise the social security system, assail such rights as abortion and tick off the items on a shopping list left by the National Rifle Association (NRA).

But we have seen many sides to polyhedron Gore of late, and it has been a blend of two which has proved most effective (indeed, if left un-spun by his team, it might have won him the election): his tough-guy Sopranos act and his 'voice-of-experience-and-respect-for-history' act. When he emerged to speak during Wednesday's crisis, he did so in deep, sombre tones about his respect for the sanctity of America\u00cds democracy and its institutions, including the Electoral College. Then, behind the scenes, Gore rolled his sleeves up and, with Daley, donned his gloves to face his foe. Additional reporting by Ed Helmore in New York",

The facility is closed for three days. Never let the end of the world get in the way of a statutory holiday. Down the road, the veterans of wars past are preparing for their annual stiff-backed, pot-bellied march, led this year by General Alexander Haig, who never got enough votes to become President himself.</p> <p>Even further down the road, at Democratic Party headquarters, a squad of lawyers are taking affidavits from a chattering queue of the old, infirm and blue-rinsed. Across at the City Hall car park, dozens of TV vans with dishes pointed to the sky stand ready to flash the news as it happens.</p> <p>But, apart from six rota protesters on interview duty by the car park, there is no news. The news, like George W. Bush and Al Gore, will have to wait; at least until Tuesday, when a circuit judge hears the first case about befuddled balloting, and probably rather longer.</p> <p>Some people are working. The same groaning gang which brought the first count and the recount are counting again, this time a random sample of one per cent of the ballot forms plus a hand count from the three most contentious precincts.</p> <p>They, like other Florida counties staging a re-recount, will report by Tuesday (though Broward, just to the south, has been treading water because the supervisor of elections went on holiday on Thursday and didn't leave a telephone number).</p> <p>Carl Hiassen, the barbed chronicler of Florida absurdity, couldn't have invented a script like this. What is West Palm Beach? The dowdier partner, across the bay, of Glitz City. If the Palm Beach Post hadn't had the future of the White House to write about, it would have been stuck with 'Boy unhurt after riding bike into car's path' or possibly Jupiter town council's efforts to confer 'historic status' on the Burt Reynolds Dinner Theatre which, at 21, is more threatened and slightly less historic than Burt's toupee.</p> <p>The big TV boys, down from Atlanta or New York, can stage their town meetings, full of earnest confrontations, but essentially this is a sleepy little hollow of a place, a stretch of communities, Lake Worth, Boynton Beach, Delray Beach, Boca Raton, where nothing much is intended to happen because there are guards on the condominium gates and the sweltering sun drains energy away.</p> <p>'They're making us look like fools,' says Dave at the drug store counter. He's talking about the Lenos and Lettermans of the late, jokey television shows. Leno: 'Who's counting the vote down there? Don King.' Letterman: 'This is what happens when elections aren't fixed. They're this close.'</p> <p>Too many sketches about doddery OAPs holding the nation to ransom. Palm Beach County doesn't altogether like the heat. It quite enjoyed the first couple of days when Clematis Street and Banyan Boulevard were full of camera teams eager for every last soundbite, but now the thrill, like Wall Street, is subsiding.</p> <p>Something was clearly wrong last Tuesday.

      "bodyText": "Here in West Palm Beach is global crisis centre, otherwise known as the Palm Beach Judiciary Facility, a shining legal temple in beige and brown marble somewhat larger than the Palace of Westminster. This is Veterans Day weekend. The facility is closed for three days. Never let the end of the world get in the way of a statutory holiday. Down the road, the veterans of wars past are preparing for their annual stiff-backed, pot-bellied march, led this year by General Alexander Haig, who never got enough votes to become President himself. Even further down the road, at Democratic Party headquarters, a squad of lawyers are taking affidavits from a chattering queue of the old, infirm and blue-rinsed. Across at the City Hall car park, dozens of TV vans with dishes pointed to the sky stand ready to flash the news as it happens. But, apart from six rota protesters on interview duty by the car park, there is no news. The news, like George W. Bush and Al Gore, will have to wait; at least until Tuesday, when a circuit judge hears the first case about befuddled balloting, and probably rather longer. Some people are working. The same groaning gang which brought the first count and the recount are counting again, this time a random sample of one per cent of the ballot forms plus a hand count from the three most contentious precincts. They, like other Florida counties staging a re-recount, will report by Tuesday (though Broward, just to the south, has been treading water because the supervisor of elections went on holiday on Thursday and didn't leave a telephone number). Carl Hiassen, the barbed chronicler of Florida absurdity, couldn't have invented a script like this. What is West Palm Beach? The dowdier partner, across the bay, of Glitz City. If the Palm Beach Post hadn't had the future of the White House to write about, it would have been stuck with 'Boy unhurt after riding bike into car's path' or possibly Jupiter town council's efforts to confer 'historic status' on the Burt Reynolds Dinner Theatre which, at 21, is more threatened and slightly less historic than Burt's toupee. The big TV boys, down from Atlanta or New York, can stage their town meetings, full of earnest confrontations, but essentially this is a sleepy little hollow of a place, a stretch of communities, Lake Worth, Boynton Beach, Delray Beach, Boca Raton, where nothing much is intended to happen because there are guards on the condominium gates and the sweltering sun drains energy away. 'They're making us look like fools,' says Dave at the drug store counter. He's talking about the Lenos and Lettermans of the late, jokey television shows. Leno: 'Who's counting the vote down there? Don King.' Letterman: 'This is what happens when elections aren't fixed. They're this close.' Too many sketches about doddery OAPs holding the nation to ransom. Palm Beach County doesn't altogether like the heat. It quite enjoyed the first couple of days when Clematis Street and Banyan Boulevard were full of camera teams eager for every last soundbite, but now the thrill, like Wall Street, is subsiding. Something was clearly wrong last Tuesday. Pat Buchanan, the candidate of right-wing oblivion, got 3,407 votes, far more than anywhere else in Florida. That was strange, especially when most of his votes came from Jewish and black precincts. Equally mystifying, some 19,120 votes, about four per cent, were ruled invalid because the antiquated election machines had punched a vote for two candidates, not one. How could that be?

Now that the race ends up in a wonderfully chaotic period where nobody in presumed authority knows anything, we\"re finally getting a decent show. We earned this. Harry Shearer is the voice of Charles Montgomery Burns in \"The Simpsons\". He is also the voice of Waylon Smithers, Ned Flanders, Principal Skinner, Kent Brockman and Lenny (to name just a few). When not being a Simpson, he has enjoyed a long career as a comic actor and writer, including stints writing for \"Saturday Night Live\" and the part of bassist Derek Smalls in \"This Is Spinal Tap\".",

Last Wednesday, Debra Inbar's husband rose early to catch the news, eager to learn who would be the next President of the world's most powerful nation. When his wife heard how the voting was progressing she was dumbfounded. 'I suddenly came to realise that my one modest vote could, in fact, be a key decision maker,' says 42-year-old Inbar. </p> <p>An American Jew with Israeli citizenship, Inbar has lived in the northern coastal town of Haifa for more than 20 years. She was born in New York, but raised in Florida. West Palm Beach is where she calls home. Inbar is proud to think that her vital ballot paper, along with the hundreds of others at the Florida elections office, might determine whether Florida - and the Presidency - goes to Al Gore or George W. Bush. </p> <p>She had no doubts about her choice. 'I was really excited about Joe Lieberman when I heard he was Gore's running mate,' says Inbar, an executive secretary in a hi-tech company. 'Israel has had a good relationship with the Clinton administration,' she claims, and she voted for Gore in order to continue that. Strong Jewish connections link Florida, where Inbar's mother lives, and the state of Israel. Those family members who left America in search of the Promised Land can still nominate whom they want to run their country. </p> <p>Officials estimate that there could be between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans in Israel, including children. Some live here on a permanent basis, some temporarily. Political activists in America attempt to root out every potential US voter in Israel, while party supporters on the ground try to register them and coerce each citizen into completing an absentee ballot. Between 120 and 200 US citizens with Florida voting rights live in Israel, and Democratic Party activists believe the vast majority of those voting by absentee ballots chose Gore. </p> <p>Eliyahu Weinstein, a Republican spin doctor living in Israel, figures on a different number of potential voters. 'I estimate there are about 2,000 American voters here from Florida, but I have only registered 1,000 of them,' he says. 'Unfortunately, the last man that I gave a register form to posted it too late. That, I'm afraid, is a victory for Al Gore,' he sighs. In Florida, officials allow 10 days to receive and count overseas votes and a large portion of them come from military personnel who are stationed abroad. 'Voting overseas can sometimes be a complicated matter,' says David Froehlich, a political activist for the Democrats abroad. According to Inbar, the absentee ballot she received one morning was very confusing. In fact, she received two. 'The first envelope I opened had a yellow form in it,' she says. 'And although it was rather unclear, I filled it out as I saw fit and mailed it off.' </p> <p>She gave what she thought was an identical envelope to her young child who promptly tore it to shreds. Picking up the tattered pieces of paper, she was shocked to discover the second form was a different colour. 'It was bright pink and marked 'For special attention', she shrieks, 'I did not know what to do. I had already mailed the first yellow ballot. If I sent off the second ballot, my vote would have been annulled, right?' </p> <p>Miles away, in a different time zone, things were not so crystal clear either. According to Inbar, the large elderly community who live at West Palm Beach, including people like her mother, complained that the ballot was not particularly user-friendly. 'You never know! People could have made mistakes or they could have been too embarrassed to ask for explanations,' Inbar points out. 'I myself didn't know who to call when I received two different colour ballots. I felt foolish.' </p> <p>So as the agitation and confusion grows over voting irregularities, the US voters in Israel can only sit around sipping iced coffees and cringeing at America's electoral system, which has been near fatally wounded in this circus of a campaign. But it is not only Americans in Israel who will make up the equation that seems likely to settle a presidency. Several thousand ballots are expected from overseas absentees, who include a large concentration of military personnel and businesspeople. They must have their ballots postmarked by 7 November and received for counting by 17 November. </p> <p>Yesterday the absentee vote looked to be plunged into the controversy over electoral inconsistencies in the Florida vote when servicemen based in Britain claimed they had received duplicate ballot papers. Military voters have historically favoured Florida Republicans and in 1996 gave Republican nominee Bob Dole 54 per cent of their vote, compared with the 43 per cent he received statewide. Republican officials cited these trends when they predicted that Bush would take most of the overseas absentee ballots. Yet Democratic campaign officials and some other analysts noted some other facts that could make the outcome less certain. </p> <p> Florida has a heavy concentration of military personnel and installations, including seven major navy and five large air force bases. But Florida is also frequently chosen as a legal residence by military personnel who live in other states, because it lacks a state income tax. The US Air Force includes 5,200 personnel from Florida assigned in Europe and an additional 4,300 in the Pacific. Despite the suggestion that many of these may vote Republican some analysts believe the troops may be more sympathetic to Democrats than it appears. They note that the military has a disproportionately large number of minority members, who lean Democratic. About 37 per cent of the active-duty force is non-white. </p> <p> According to the LA Times, Charles Moskos, a Northwestern University sociologist who specialises in military studies, surveyed army enlisted personnel in September who were deployed in Kosovo. He found that 32 per cent described themselves as liberal, 44 per cent as 'middle of the road' and 24 per cent as conservative. Indeed one US airman from Florida at the Ramstein Air Base in Berlin - quoted in the LA Times - said that, among the airforce personnel he knew, the split was 'about 50-50.' 'The older guys are more Bush; the younger guys are more Gore,' said airman Cedric Clark.</p>",

His dependence on money from the tobacco and pharmaceutical industries and the gun lobby will keep him from taking firm action on gun control, smoking, or the high cost of healthcare. But, according to Murphy, the issue that may replace abortion as the single most important gender issue come the next election is something far larger, and far more difficult to address.

White women earn on average 74 cents for every male dollar. African-American women earn 64 cents and Latinas 54. While little was said on the issue during the election, there is, says Murphy, a growing militancy among women, an increasing number of whom have been taking their employers to court. This has led in turn to an upturn in union interest, and a nervousness in many companies that unfair wage structures might make them \"vulnerable'.</p> <p>So the groundwork has already been done. All that's needed is a politician to swoop in and take all the credit. In Murphy's view, Gore was seeking to do just this at the end of the campaign, when he began to many pointed comments about wage discrimination.

      "body": "<p>George W. Bush launched a legal battle yesterday to prevent the manual recount of votes in Florida, amid growing Republican fears that he could lose the battle raging over the deadlocked presidential election.</p> <p>James Baker, Bush's elder statesman in Tallahassee, announced that the Republi cans would now be seeking an 'emergency judge' - a Federal judge in chambers - to grant an injunction stopping the recounts. Republican lawyers will argue that the recounts are a 'public mischief'.</p> <p>The Florida vote, at present won by Bush after a recount by a majority of only 327 votes, will decide the outcome of the razor-edge election. Baker insisted a manual recount would be more sus ceptible to error than a machine tally.</p> <p>'Machines are neither Republicans nor Democrats and therefore can be neither consciously nor unconsciously biased,' he said.</p> <p>Speaking yesterday at his ranch near Crawford, Texas, Bush was weary but sombre, fielding questions about his decision to litigate and passing on the response to Baker.</p> <p>He admitted it was 'a strange time', and that 'we are all in limbo' - but insisted: 'There is a very good chance that Dick Cheney and I will be President and Vice President. We have got to be prepared'. Mr Cheney, however, added that appointments to any cabinet-in-waiting would be put on hold.</p> <p>Earlier, calling for some 'finality' to the process which has frozen American politics for five days, Baker issued the veiled threat: 'We can't just sit on our hands - we will be forced to do what might be in our personal interest.'</p> <p>He is widely taken to mean that Republicans could mount challenges to desperately narrow results in New Mexico, Oregon, Iowa and Wisconsin, where Gore is the assumed winner in at least three states, thus throwing the country into more weeks of chaos. But Democ rats here believe this is bluster, aimed at blocking the manual recounts now scheduled or under way in four key Florida counties.</p> <p>The Bush team's move to seek injunctions against the hand counts means they are quitting the high ground of 'honouring the people's verdict' for the lower ground of courtroom wrangling in a complex game of propaganda manoeuvrings. So far, American public opinion seems relatively calm - only a third of voters are 'angry' about the situation in a CNN/ Time poll - but that mood will change if the affair drags on beyond this week, with heavy penalties for the side seen as responsible.</p> <p>Gore has been under pressure from a few Democrats - including Bill Bradley, the man he beat for the nomination - not to indulge in legal warfare, but the prize of emerging as the good guy who won the ballot will help silence his critics for a time.</p> <p>Yesterday President Clinton weighed in with a radio call for time and patience. 'The important thing for all of us to remember now is that a process for resolving the discrepancies and challenges to the election is in motion. The rest of us need to be patient and wait for the results.'</p> <p>The battle for the White House became the battle of the 'hanging chad' in Florida yesterday. The chad is the tiny rectangle of paper punched out of the ballots by voters using the 50-year-old voting mechanisms in many Florida counties. If it leaves a clean hole the tabulating machinery registers a vote. If isn't fully detached and merely hangs in the slot, then the ballot may automatically be declared invalid. With Bush's lead over Gore in Florida now reckoned at a mere 327 votes, every change to the total matters.</p> <p>The Democrats are running two arguments simultaneously. One is that the possibly illegal design of the ballot form in Palm Beach County confused over 20,000 voters, some of whom voted for the maverick right-winger Pat Buchanan rather than Gore and some of whom voted accidentally for two candidates, making their ballots invalid. But resorting to hand counts - of a sampling of all the votes in the county and of every vote in three heavily Democratic precincts - has a deeper purpose.</p> <p>Hand counts are more accurate than machine counts and allow the tellers to examine the semi-detached chads and weight of indentations to interpret the voter's intention. Since Palm Beach voted heavily for Gore last Tuesday, it is a clear statistical calculation that more votes rescued from the invalid stack will be Democratic than Republican.</p> <p>Meanwhile, three other counties here, including the giant Broward and Dade counties, are preparing their own hand counts tomorrow. Volusia county, which does not punch cards, also began to recount 196,000 ballots yesterday. All four recounting counties have a Democrat majority on the local election supervisory boards.</p> <p>The gamble is that these hand recounts will produce a complete switch in the Florida total by the end of the week, making Gore the victor in both the national popular vote and the state-by-state Electoral College vote.</p> <p>There are two vital dates this week. One is Tuesday, when Florida authorities are due to certify the election result - but that may prove impossible because as many as 7,000 absentee ballots remain to be counted on Friday, 10 days after the election.</p> <p>Nor is there any sign that the manual recount battle on the ground won't turn tit-for-tat. It is reported from Jacksonville that 22,000 ballots were declared invalid, and Jacksonville is a Republican city. What's sauce for Palm Beach Democrats may yet be sauce for Jacksonville Republicans.</p>",

The Florida vote, at present won by Bush after a recount by a majority of only 327 votes, will decide the outcome of the razor-edge election. Baker insisted a manual recount would be more sus ceptible to error than a machine tally. 'Machines are neither Republicans nor Democrats and therefore can be neither consciously nor unconsciously biased,' he said. Speaking yesterday at his ranch near Crawford, Texas, Bush was weary but sombre, fielding questions about his decision to litigate and passing on the response to Baker. He admitted it was 'a strange time', and that 'we are all in limbo' - but insisted: 'There is a very good chance that Dick Cheney and I will be President and Vice President. We have got to be prepared'. Mr Cheney, however, added that appointments to any cabinet-in-waiting would be put on hold. Earlier, calling for some 'finality' to the process which has frozen American politics for five days, Baker issued the veiled threat: 'We can't just sit on our hands - we will be forced to do what might be in our personal interest.' He is widely taken to mean that Republicans could mount challenges to desperately narrow results in New Mexico, Oregon, Iowa and Wisconsin, where Gore is the assumed winner in at least three states, thus throwing the country into more weeks of chaos. But Democ rats here believe this is bluster, aimed at blocking the manual recounts now scheduled or under way in four key Florida counties. The Bush team's move to seek injunctions against the hand counts means they are quitting the high ground of 'honouring the people's verdict' for the lower ground of courtroom wrangling in a complex game of propaganda manoeuvrings. So far, American public opinion seems relatively calm - only a third of voters are 'angry' about the situation in a CNN/ Time poll - but that mood will change if the affair drags on beyond this week, with heavy penalties for the side seen as responsible. Gore has been under pressure from a few Democrats - including Bill Bradley, the man he beat for the nomination - not to indulge in legal warfare, but the prize of emerging as the good guy who won the ballot will help silence his critics for a time. Yesterday President Clinton weighed in with a radio call for time and patience. 'The important thing for all of us to remember now is that a process for resolving the discrepancies and challenges to the election is in motion. The rest of us need to be patient and wait for the results.' The battle for the White House became the battle of the 'hanging chad' in Florida yesterday. The chad is the tiny rectangle of paper punched out of the ballots by voters using the 50-year-old voting mechanisms in many Florida counties. If it leaves a clean hole the tabulating machinery registers a vote. If isn't fully detached and merely hangs in the slot, then the ballot may automatically be declared invalid. With Bush's lead over Gore in Florida now reckoned at a mere 327 votes, every change to the total matters. The Democrats are running two arguments simultaneously. One is that the possibly illegal design of the ballot form in Palm Beach County confused over 20,000 voters, some of whom voted for the maverick right-winger Pat Buchanan rather than Gore and some of whom voted accidentally for two candidates, making their ballots invalid. But resorting to hand counts - of a sampling of all the votes in the county and of every vote in three heavily Democratic precincts - has a deeper purpose. Hand counts are more accurate than machine counts and allow the tellers to examine the semi-detached chads and weight of indentations to interpret the voter's intention. Since Palm Beach voted heavily for Gore last Tuesday, it is a clear statistical calculation that more votes rescued from the invalid stack will be Democratic than Republican. Meanwhile, three other counties here, including the giant Broward and Dade counties, are preparing their own hand counts tomorrow. Volusia county, which does not punch cards, also began to recount 196,000 ballots yesterday. All four recounting counties have a Democrat majority on the local election supervisory boards. The gamble is that these hand recounts will produce a complete switch in the Florida total by the end of the week, making Gore the victor in both the national popular vote and the state-by-state Electoral College vote. There are two vital dates this week. One is Tuesday, when Florida authorities are due to certify the election result - but that may prove impossible because as many as 7,000 absentee ballots remain to be counted on Friday, 10 days after the election. Nor is there any sign that the manual recount battle on the ground won't turn tit-for-tat. It is reported from Jacksonville that 22,000 ballots were declared invalid, and Jacksonville is a Republican city. What's sauce for Palm Beach Democrats may yet be sauce for Jacksonville Republicans.",

      "body": "<p>As the presidential election collapsed into chaos, Hillary Clinton claimed her senate seat last Tuesday night in New York looking less like a hard-bitten political fighter and more like a delighted wife and mother. Flanked by her husband and daughter, the family's mantle of extraordinary power slipped away and they appeared, if only for a moment, like any family buoyed by sudden good news; Bill Clinton, beaming with pride and biting his lip as if to hold back tears, clasped the hand of Chelsea Clinton, herself alight with emotion.</p> <p>In taking centre stage, Mrs Clinton gave a victory address that at once catapulted her out of her husband's shadow where she has been for 26 years, first as an attorney general's wife in a small southern state, then as the governor's wife, and then for the past eight years as First Lady. No First Lady had ever run for elected office, much less in a newly adopted state, and emerged as her own woman in the world's most financially and culturally influential city.</p> <p>Her win marks the end of one chapter and the beginning of another. At her victory celebration, friends said they could barely fathom the events of the past few years ending up this way. \"Weird doesn't even begin to describe this,' said Clinton family lawyer David Kendall, who was the first to inform her that her husband had admitted his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.</p> <p>\"The word is vindication,' said the Rev Donald Jones, Mrs Clinton's pastor in Park Ridge, Illinois, where she grew up. \"I think the right wing conspired to knock down both Bill and Hillary, and now she gets to stand on her own two feet.'</p> <p>On 3 January, when Bill steps down and his wife is sworn in, the transition of power, both personal and political, will be complete. \"Put the politics down for a minute,' wrote NY Daily News columnist Jim Dwyer. \"Hillary Rodham Clinton is 53 years old, her daughter is grown, her husband soon to be out of a job, and it turns out that F. Scott Fitzgerald had it wrong after all: There are second acts in American life.'</p> <p>To Republicans, New York Senator Clinton is more than just a blow. Bill Clinton, like most former presidents, may fade in the background but his opponents must now learn to live with the reality of a new political torchbearer. More liberal than her husband, and just as ambitious, Mrs Clinton will keep the family name and the political style it spawned - Clintonism - in the public arena for years to come.</p> <p>Worse still for the legions of Clinton haters, they face the prospect that she will some day run for President herself, an ambition she denied she held last week - at least until her six-year term runs out. \"It's like any new job; you have to find your footing,\" she said of her new elected office. \"You have to work hard to learn the ropes and the rules.\" Still, with a Gore defeat, Hillary would immediately emerge as the Democrats\" brightest shining star and a potential walk-in for the 2004 party nomination.</p> <p>But the structures of the next stage in the expansion of Bill and Hillary's family business are still hard to predict. \"It'll be a role reversal between her and Bill,' predicts former adviser-turned-Clinton baiter Dick Morris. \"He'll run her campaigns and life just as she ran his. She becomes his major project.'</p> <p>On Tuesday, there was little evidence of the froideur that is often said to exist between the two: although she did not include him in her victory photo, she took her husband's hand as they left the stage. At a party later, co-hosted by the publisher Tina Brown, the President told his guests how proud he was of his wife, who leaned into him, nuzzling his neck as he stroked her green trouser-suited back. In her speech, she effusively thanked her husband, quelling speculation that the family would stay so only in name. \"I would not have been standing there without the support and work of my husband,\" she said.</p> <p>\"It's not so much of a power struggle as a partnership. They are no different from any other couple except they share an interest in power,' says Joe Conason, columnist for the New York Observer. \"He's the typical errant husband and she's the typical wife who hopes he'll change his ways. He's changed. She loves him. He loves her and doesn't want to lose her, and they're not going to get divorced.'</p> <p>For two highly effective, highly intelligent people, the evidence of their affection lies in Chelsea who, by all accounts, has emerged from adolescence as a charming woman with no stated interest in following her parents into politics. But Dick Morris maintains: \"President Clinton is going to stay with Hillary as her manager and consultant; that does not mean they are actively going to stay married.\" But for all the attention accorded to Bill and Hillary, it is bizarrely 20-year-old Chelsea who is the emergent star of the family. Just five years ago, when she visited the Taj Mahal with her mother, she was a shy 15-year-old struggling with her celebrity and kept firmly off limits to the press. Having taken a year off from Stanford, she's been travelling everywhere with her mother, appearing poised and confident, and sometimes introducing her at rallies.</p> <p>Friends of the family say Chelsea is the Clintons\" common interest and her father is noticeably buoyed when she is around. Friends say she's still leaning toward a career in paediatric medicine but has also expressed through her campaigning, if not directly, an interest in the family business. Asked what he would do if she said she was thinking of going into politics, Clinton has said he would encourage her.</p> <p>But he would ask her three questions first: if she was prepared to lose, if she had some higher purpose in wanting to hold office, and \"do you really want to pay the price to win, to really work hard and to take the lows? And if Chelsea can answer all three of those questions yes, then I would encourage her.'</p> <p>And now that Hillary has won her job - one that may turn out to be less fun and productive than anticipated - the question remains: what kind of life will the Clintons carve for themselves in the naked city? Some observers believe the couple do not wish to stay in Chappaqua, the small dormitory town where they bought a house last year as a campaign launching pad. During the long campaign, she has been using Steven Spielberg's apartment and friends have reportedly been hunting for an apartment overlooking Central Park on their behalf. Others believe they will simply bypass the city and find a new home in Washington. Bill Clinton has said he plans to spend time in Arkansas, overseeing the construction of his presidential library in Little Rock.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the Clintons are enamoured of the fluidity and glamour of Manhattan life. The city, fat on Wall Street profits, has experienced a resurgence in recent years and lower Manhattan has become, in effect, Europe in America. According to Newsweek, the traffic of people as well as money, ideas and culture between New York and London has created a new entity - the inelegantly named NY-LON, \"a single city inconveniently separated by an ocean'. For the internationally minded Clintons New York offers the perfect nexus of opportunity and influence in a liberal city.</p> <p>Taken under the wing of Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein and Lazard Freres's Steve Rattner, the couple have found themselves feted by Wall Street billionaires, media moguls, actors and actresses and celebrities of every description. In Florida a Weinstein-organised court of stars including Glenn Close, Robert De Niro, Ben Affleck, Jon Bon Jovi and Stevie Wonder was assembled to flank the President as he campaigned for Gore. Many of those same stars turned out for the Clintons for an election night party organised by Weinstein, Brown and financial news service chief Michael Bloomberg.</p> <p>It was a signal, if any were needed, that the Clintons hold keys to at least the most conspicuously glitzy part of the city's life. \"They like being in the spotlight and they like the artists, the entertainment and Wall Street people, those who are interested in issues but not necessarily politics,' says Conason. But, he says, there are many different levels of New York society, not all of them welcoming. \"The old waspy society of the Upper East Side doesn't like them and that socialite stratum is probably not interesting to them either.'</p> <p>Still, as much as Hillary and Bill appreciate the company of the media meritocracy, many doubt they are entirely at ease in that milieu. \"They'll be in huge demand but she's so deadly serious, earnest and calculating - in the best possible way - that she's not going to get a reputation dining with the glitzocracy,' says veteran British publisher and writer Harold Evans.</p> <p>\"She certainly gets on with film stars but she's not into small talk, the price of property, who\"s up and who\"s down.' Evans doubts that establishing a library or playing golf or going to jazz clubs in Greenwich Village will be enough to keep the ex-President busy, especially as his wife is going to be spending most of her time in Washington. For a man who thrives on interaction with people, the aftermath of the first election in 20 years in which he has not campaigned for himself and won will be strange. \"His great passion is the growing interdependence of the world. I think he'll find a position on some foreign affairs council, give speeches on Wall Street.' In an interview with Evans in Talk magazine, Clinton said that his years as President had made him more idealistic than when he was first elected. \"The trick for a former President is to trade in all the power for influence and impact over a smaller number of things that are profoundly important, and do it in a way that does not get underfoot of the next President.'</p> <p>As many have pointed out, Hillary Clinton has remained an essentially aloof and distant figure, carefully allying herself with her husband's achievements and side-stepping his failures.

      "bodyText": "As the presidential election collapsed into chaos, Hillary Clinton claimed her senate seat last Tuesday night in New York looking less like a hard-bitten political fighter and more like a delighted wife and mother. Flanked by her husband and daughter, the family's mantle of extraordinary power slipped away and they appeared, if only for a moment, like any family buoyed by sudden good news; Bill Clinton, beaming with pride and biting his lip as if to hold back tears, clasped the hand of Chelsea Clinton, herself alight with emotion. In taking centre stage, Mrs Clinton gave a victory address that at once catapulted her out of her husband's shadow where she has been for 26 years, first as an attorney general's wife in a small southern state, then as the governor's wife, and then for the past eight years as First Lady. No First Lady had ever run for elected office, much less in a newly adopted state, and emerged as her own woman in the world's most financially and culturally influential city. Her win marks the end of one chapter and the beginning of another. At her victory celebration, friends said they could barely fathom the events of the past few years ending up this way. \"Weird doesn't even begin to describe this,' said Clinton family lawyer David Kendall, who was the first to inform her that her husband had admitted his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. \"The word is vindication,' said the Rev Donald Jones, Mrs Clinton's pastor in Park Ridge, Illinois, where she grew up. \"I think the right wing conspired to knock down both Bill and Hillary, and now she gets to stand on her own two feet.' On 3 January, when Bill steps down and his wife is sworn in, the transition of power, both personal and political, will be complete. \"Put the politics down for a minute,' wrote NY Daily News columnist Jim Dwyer. \"Hillary Rodham Clinton is 53 years old, her daughter is grown, her husband soon to be out of a job, and it turns out that F. Scott Fitzgerald had it wrong after all: There are second acts in American life.' To Republicans, New York Senator Clinton is more than just a blow. Bill Clinton, like most former presidents, may fade in the background but his opponents must now learn to live with the reality of a new political torchbearer. More liberal than her husband, and just as ambitious, Mrs Clinton will keep the family name and the political style it spawned - Clintonism - in the public arena for years to come. Worse still for the legions of Clinton haters, they face the prospect that she will some day run for President herself, an ambition she denied she held last week - at least until her six-year term runs out. \"It's like any new job; you have to find your footing,\" she said of her new elected office. \"You have to work hard to learn the ropes and the rules.\" Still, with a Gore defeat, Hillary would immediately emerge as the Democrats\" brightest shining star and a potential walk-in for the 2004 party nomination. But the structures of the next stage in the expansion of Bill and Hillary's family business are still hard to predict. \"It'll be a role reversal between her and Bill,' predicts former adviser-turned-Clinton baiter Dick Morris. \"He'll run her campaigns and life just as she ran his. She becomes his major project.' On Tuesday, there was little evidence of the froideur that is often said to exist between the two: although she did not include him in her victory photo, she took her husband's hand as they left the stage. At a party later, co-hosted by the publisher Tina Brown, the President told his guests how proud he was of his wife, who leaned into him, nuzzling his neck as he stroked her green trouser-suited back. In her speech, she effusively thanked her husband, quelling speculation that the family would stay so only in name. \"I would not have been standing there without the support and work of my husband,\" she said. \"It's not so much of a power struggle as a partnership. They are no different from any other couple except they share an interest in power,' says Joe Conason, columnist for the New York Observer. \"He's the typical errant husband and she's the typical wife who hopes he'll change his ways. He's changed. She loves him. He loves her and doesn't want to lose her, and they're not going to get divorced.' For two highly effective, highly intelligent people, the evidence of their affection lies in Chelsea who, by all accounts, has emerged from adolescence as a charming woman with no stated interest in following her parents into politics. But Dick Morris maintains: \"President Clinton is going to stay with Hillary as her manager and consultant; that does not mean they are actively going to stay married.\" But for all the attention accorded to Bill and Hillary, it is bizarrely 20-year-old Chelsea who is the emergent star of the family. Just five years ago, when she visited the Taj Mahal with her mother, she was a shy 15-year-old struggling with her celebrity and kept firmly off limits to the press. Having taken a year off from Stanford, she's been travelling everywhere with her mother, appearing poised and confident, and sometimes introducing her at rallies. Friends of the family say Chelsea is the Clintons\" common interest and her father is noticeably buoyed when she is around. Friends say she's still leaning toward a career in paediatric medicine but has also expressed through her campaigning, if not directly, an interest in the family business. Asked what he would do if she said she was thinking of going into politics, Clinton has said he would encourage her. But he would ask her three questions first: if she was prepared to lose, if she had some higher purpose in wanting to hold office, and \"do you really want to pay the price to win, to really work hard and to take the lows? And if Chelsea can answer all three of those questions yes, then I would encourage her.' And now that Hillary has won her job - one that may turn out to be less fun and productive than anticipated - the question remains: what kind of life will the Clintons carve for themselves in the naked city? Some observers believe the couple do not wish to stay in Chappaqua, the small dormitory town where they bought a house last year as a campaign launching pad. During the long campaign, she has been using Steven Spielberg's apartment and friends have reportedly been hunting for an apartment overlooking Central Park on their behalf. Others believe they will simply bypass the city and find a new home in Washington. Bill Clinton has said he plans to spend time in Arkansas, overseeing the construction of his presidential library in Little Rock. There is no doubt that the Clintons are enamoured of the fluidity and glamour of Manhattan life. The city, fat on Wall Street profits, has experienced a resurgence in recent years and lower Manhattan has become, in effect, Europe in America. According to Newsweek, the traffic of people as well as money, ideas and culture between New York and London has created a new entity - the inelegantly named NY-LON, \"a single city inconveniently separated by an ocean'. For the internationally minded Clintons New York offers the perfect nexus of opportunity and influence in a liberal city. Taken under the wing of Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein and Lazard Freres's Steve Rattner, the couple have found themselves feted by Wall Street billionaires, media moguls, actors and actresses and celebrities of every description. In Florida a Weinstein-organised court of stars including Glenn Close, Robert De Niro, Ben Affleck, Jon Bon Jovi and Stevie Wonder was assembled to flank the President as he campaigned for Gore. Many of those same stars turned out for the Clintons for an election night party organised by Weinstein, Brown and financial news service chief Michael Bloomberg. It was a signal, if any were needed, that the Clintons hold keys to at least the most conspicuously glitzy part of the city's life. \"They like being in the spotlight and they like the artists, the entertainment and Wall Street people, those who are interested in issues but not necessarily politics,' says Conason. But, he says, there are many different levels of New York society, not all of them welcoming. \"The old waspy society of the Upper East Side doesn't like them and that socialite stratum is probably not interesting to them either.' Still, as much as Hillary and Bill appreciate the company of the media meritocracy, many doubt they are entirely at ease in that milieu. \"They'll be in huge demand but she's so deadly serious, earnest and calculating - in the best possible way - that she's not going to get a reputation dining with the glitzocracy,' says veteran British publisher and writer Harold Evans. \"She certainly gets on with film stars but she's not into small talk, the price of property, who\"s up and who\"s down.' Evans doubts that establishing a library or playing golf or going to jazz clubs in Greenwich Village will be enough to keep the ex-President busy, especially as his wife is going to be spending most of her time in Washington. For a man who thrives on interaction with people, the aftermath of the first election in 20 years in which he has not campaigned for himself and won will be strange. \"His great passion is the growing interdependence of the world. I think he'll find a position on some foreign affairs council, give speeches on Wall Street.' In an interview with Evans in Talk magazine, Clinton said that his years as President had made him more idealistic than when he was first elected. \"The trick for a former President is to trade in all the power for influence and impact over a smaller number of things that are profoundly important, and do it in a way that does not get underfoot of the next President.' As many have pointed out, Hillary Clinton has remained an essentially aloof and distant figure, carefully allying herself with her husband's achievements and side-stepping his failures. She may have won her own electoral identity through the long, tough New York campaign but the question remains what exactly it is she has won. As junior senator from New York in a Republican-leaning Senate, she will chair no sub-committees and be unable to hire more than a bare-bones staff. Although she has said she wants to serve on the committees on foreign relations and appropriations [giving her a chance to funnel federal dollars to New York] Republicans will do their best to stall her efforts. She will climb aboard a shuttle flight to Washington every week to do the drudge work of a senator, attending hearings, grinning through photo opportunities, standing patiently at the back of press conferences, waiting to speak. She will sit among senators who eagerly sought her husband's impeachment and she will instantly become the nation's best-known Democrat if Gore ultimately loses to Bush. \"There's no way the First Lady is going to be just another freshman. She's going to be a magnet for media attention,' says political scholar Stephen Hess. That may not only create difficulties with more senior Democrats, particularly Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, but attract the Republicans' bitter attentions. After eight, divisive years in the White House that is not new, but as an elected official she now stands to take the heat directly. \"She may well replace Ted Kennedy as the poster child for Republican fundraising,' says former Reagan chief of staff Ken Duberstein. Mrs Clinton now has her own elected platform from which to respond to criticism and has quashed accusations of being a carpetbagger. According to polls, half the voters said her lack of New York roots was of little or no consequence.

What is certain is that Al and Tipper Gore, President and First Lady or not, will not be welcome. Gore's exclusion of his boss from his election campaign deeply hurt Clinton and it's no secret that Hillary and Tipper have hardly spoken since she took such a judgmental line on Clinton's reckless dalliance, mumbling that Monica was younger than her own daughter. There are few people who do not believe Hillary Clinton's New York adventure is anything less than a prelude to her own White House run, if not in 2004 then in 2008. \"Of course she'll run,' said Senator Daniel Moynihan, the man whose senate seat she assumed - at least temporarily.",

Yet all you hear from Al Gore\"s outriders and dummy-ventriloquists is that he \"spoilt\" things for their man.</p> <p>This is a ridiculous noise, compounded of self-pity and a \"spoilt\" sense of entitlement. Here are some obvious correctives to it:</p> <p>1. In a year when the Democrats campaigned against an unpopular Republican Congress, they failed to retake either the Senate or the House. (And, in the most salient seats they did hold or take, they relied on a dead man on the ballot and on a man who spent a record $60 million of his own personal fortune.)</p> <p>The Green Party was not running for Congress. But if it had been, the Democrats would still have blamed Nader rather than themselves for the defeat.</p> <p>2. Gore lost several key states (including his own home state of Tennessee where the Nader vote was negligible) by several other \"margins\". These include:</p> <p>(a) The almost 100 million Americans he could not get to vote for him.</p> <p>(b) The number of people who are disenfranchised because of non-violent narcotics convictions (estimated in Florida and elsewhere to number 13 per cent of the adult black male population, alone).</p> <p>(c) The number of people who voted for Pat Buchanan\"s ill-named Reform Party.</p> <p>Gore could not motivate the first group. He loudly approves of the \"War on Drugs\" that incarcerates and then disenfranchises the second. And nobody - certainly no Republican - ever said Buchanan had no business running on his own programme.</p> <p>It is only in liberal circles that one hears party pluralism denounced as something akin to treason or sabotage. The Veep\"s hacks ignore all the above factors and blame the crisis on those voters who decided to think for themselves (to vote for Nader, for example, because he is the only candidate who favours decriminalising marijuana and abolishing capital punishment).</p> <p>A few months ago there was a convention of American political scientists in my home town of Washington. They unveiled a new \"model\" of the American electoral mindset, and announced confidently that in a year like this the Vice President could not be beaten.</p> <p>No Republican challenger, they said, could hope to prevail at a time of huge prosperity at home and peace overseas. I thought this might be too complacent, but not by that much. And still Gore managed to blow it, and to make himself vulnerable to one of the most mediocre candidates in US history.</p> <p>He cannot whine about this; not after failing in Tennessee. Yet in the tones of his partisans one can hear an aggrieved intolerance. On election night at a party thrown by Miramax, some were overheard by the Washington Post to say they would like to \"kill\", not Bush or Buchanan, but Ralph Nader.</p> <p>The newly anointed Senatorial First Lady, in whose honour the party was thrown, echoed the thought. I have heard the same thing, in the same words, all over the airwaves and on my email, from clapped-out liberal journos and those who hoped for a job from Gore. These types ornamented the top-dollar \"fundraising\" events and \"meet\"n\"greet\" soirees with Hollywood\"s deep thinkers; their annoyance is music to my ears.</p> <p>They thought they had bought a share in \"the process\" and found the share (and much of the process) was worthless. High time. Take one example. For eight years Gore abased himself for Clinton and uttered abject defences he knew to be untrue.</p> <p>Then on two occasions in the campaign, he announced he was suddenly \"distanced\" from all that and had miraculously become \"my own man\". Well, it\"s one thing to say it, big boy, and another thing to be it.</p> <p>Exit polls, most notably in Florida, discovered a huge number of voters who were disgusted by Clinton and Clintonism. These people have a right to vote, too. And what does Gore tell them? \"Didn\"t you hear me? I distinctly said I was \"distanced\".\" Come on.</p> <p>This would not be the only time this terrible candidate mistook his own spin for reality. After the Los Angeles convention he abruptly announced he was a foe of fat cats and big corporations and a friend of the \"people\" and the little guy.</p> <p>But the logos and the donations of corporate America were displayed all over the convention and paid for his campaign. Who did he imagine he was fooling? As with his excruciating performance in the three public \"debates\", it was enough to irritate the Republicans, but it was also enough to make people in the centre feel embarrassed and people on the left feel sick.</p> <p>And after this, to pose as if it\"s simply your turn to be President. The achievement of Nader, however, is far more than the exposure of this phoney politics. From now on two crucial matters will be established in the American mind.</p> <p>First, the Electoral College system must be reformed or abolished to give expression to the popular vote.

      "bodyText": "Here are some reasons to be glad that Ralph Nader put himself forward for the presidency: 1. He broke America\"s dirtiest and least-known secret, which is that the high-sounding \"Electoral College\" system is designed to keep the rabble from picking the President. 2. He broke America\"s second-dirtiest and best-known secret, which is that the voting process in many states - especially the state of Carl Hiassen - is tainted by corruption and manipulation. 3. He exposed the pretensions of the two major party machines, both of which covertly agree on these \"rules\" as long as they can share the spoils. 4. He showed it is still possible to run an intelligent and articulate campaign, using free and informal rather than paid media, while refusing any donation of more than $1,000 in a year when $3 billion, in so-called \"soft\" but actually illegal money, was raised and spent by the two presumptive and dynastic nominees. 5. He made a fool of the commercial media networks, all of which take the aforementioned money in advertising revenue and all of which not only misrepresented the issues in the race but messed up the one thing they are supposed to get \"right\" - the foreordained and poll-driven result.

      "body": "<p>A dazzling white, long, snaky 'S' emerged through a hole in the fence between where the herbaceous border and the compost heap used to be - followed by the rest of the swan. Magically it circled the bird table, its bilious yellow beak level with the bread platform, and then came to a dead stop. </p> <p>As idle as a painted swan upon a painted ocean. </p> <p>A bottle of Chilean chardonnay bobbed towards The Observer's canoe on the swollen Thames. This is Maidenhead, after all, so you won't find Blue Nun in the flotsam. </p> <p>A window opened. 'Do you realise you are trespassing?' said the lady of the house. </p> <p>She was right, of course. Like the swan, we were paddling in her back garden. Enter, stage right, a man with a beard, all but swimming into view, water tipping over the top of his gumboots. It was turning into a bad drawing-room farce - Waterworld meets No\u00ebl Coward. </p> <p>'This is Peter, he's come to do the lawn,' said the lady of the house. </p> <p>She looked out to where the lawn should be and saw water, water, everywhere. Faced with the surreal otherness which has transformed the most familiar thing in the world - her back garden - into a playground for passing canoes, swans and bottles, she burst into giggles. It was, indeed, thumpingly surreal. </p> <p>Not waving but wading, Britain last week was no longer a sceptred isle set in a silver sea, but an archipelago floating in an ocean of shi...well, suspiciously brown water. And yet laughter, not wailing, was the most common response to the Great Flood. </p> <p>The lady of the house then emerged and made as if to dive into the water. Her name was Elaine Batt and she is the mother of Mike, creator of the Wombles. The floods have caused financial misery, mess, despair, upheaval, inconvenience across the country. Elaine was behind her deadline to sew an Aston Villa strip for Great Uncle Bulgaria, but a neighbour's son had volunteered to wade across and transport her sewing machine to her car, so that she could finish off the job elsewhere. </p> <p>She supplied us with tea and biscuits. The swan gracefully floated in and out of people's back gardens, paying scant attention to property rights, as we paddled in its wake. A man in an upstairs bathroom goggled at the swan being pursued by our canoe, then went back to brushing his teeth, treating the ocean-going garden invasion force as the most natural thing in the world. </p> <p>The Thames proper was not navigable, its brown flow going like an express train - or, rather, trains being what they are these days, not going like an express train - but much faster, at nine knots an hour. But a few back streets of Maidenhead - if such a term as 'back street' can be used in Berkshire - parallel to the river and upstream of the bridge were awash. A BMW lay bonnet-deep in the muddy brown scum, sleek and black like a half-sunk U-boat. The temptation to laugh was irresistible. Rich people make poor victims. Maidenhead is not exactly Mozambique. </p> <p>The most arresting qualities of a flooded landscape are the enigma variations on the normal. The ordinary, even the boring, becomes remarkable when out of place. A stop sign just above the waves. A park bench, its legs sunken, its slat inches above the slop. </p> <p>For the hell of it, we lifted a couple without gumboots, Peter and Linda Jary, on to a bench for a few snaps.

      "bodyText": "A dazzling white, long, snaky 'S' emerged through a hole in the fence between where the herbaceous border and the compost heap used to be - followed by the rest of the swan. Magically it circled the bird table, its bilious yellow beak level with the bread platform, and then came to a dead stop. As idle as a painted swan upon a painted ocean. A bottle of Chilean chardonnay bobbed towards The Observer's canoe on the swollen Thames. This is Maidenhead, after all, so you won't find Blue Nun in the flotsam. A window opened. 'Do you realise you are trespassing?' said the lady of the house. She was right, of course. Like the swan, we were paddling in her back garden. Enter, stage right, a man with a beard, all but swimming into view, water tipping over the top of his gumboots. It was turning into a bad drawing-room farce - Waterworld meets No\u00ebl Coward. 'This is Peter, he's come to do the lawn,' said the lady of the house. She looked out to where the lawn should be and saw water, water, everywhere. Faced with the surreal otherness which has transformed the most familiar thing in the world - her back garden - into a playground for passing canoes, swans and bottles, she burst into giggles. It was, indeed, thumpingly surreal. Not waving but wading, Britain last week was no longer a sceptred isle set in a silver sea, but an archipelago floating in an ocean of shi...well, suspiciously brown water. And yet laughter, not wailing, was the most common response to the Great Flood. The lady of the house then emerged and made as if to dive into the water. Her name was Elaine Batt and she is the mother of Mike, creator of the Wombles. The floods have caused financial misery, mess, despair, upheaval, inconvenience across the country. Elaine was behind her deadline to sew an Aston Villa strip for Great Uncle Bulgaria, but a neighbour's son had volunteered to wade across and transport her sewing machine to her car, so that she could finish off the job elsewhere. She supplied us with tea and biscuits. The swan gracefully floated in and out of people's back gardens, paying scant attention to property rights, as we paddled in its wake. A man in an upstairs bathroom goggled at the swan being pursued by our canoe, then went back to brushing his teeth, treating the ocean-going garden invasion force as the most natural thing in the world. The Thames proper was not navigable, its brown flow going like an express train - or, rather, trains being what they are these days, not going like an express train - but much faster, at nine knots an hour. But a few back streets of Maidenhead - if such a term as 'back street' can be used in Berkshire - parallel to the river and upstream of the bridge were awash. A BMW lay bonnet-deep in the muddy brown scum, sleek and black like a half-sunk U-boat. The temptation to laugh was irresistible. Rich people make poor victims. Maidenhead is not exactly Mozambique. The most arresting qualities of a flooded landscape are the enigma variations on the normal. The ordinary, even the boring, becomes remarkable when out of place. A stop sign just above the waves. A park bench, its legs sunken, its slat inches above the slop. For the hell of it, we lifted a couple without gumboots, Peter and Linda Jary, on to a bench for a few snaps. The bench was almost underwater in the foreground; in the background the Thames zoomed by. Then a local BBC TV crew saw the 'picture' and wanted to film it. Meanwhile, the water level was rising and the Jarys were getting cold. Then ITN turned up to observe the BBC filming an Observer joke. Downstream of the bridge, three journalists from news agencies were doorstepping the riverside homes of Michael Parkinson and Rolf Harris, presumably hoping for the bloated white corpse of Parky's chequebook or a drowned didgeridoo to float by. They were out of luck. Maidenhead's tragedy is that there were too many journalists and not enough disaster victims to interview. Up north it was grim.

      "body": "<p>Gambling is as addictive as smoking or drug-taking, say researchers who have monitored hormone levels in blackjack players in a casino.</p> <p>The group - from Bremen University - discovered that games played for cash, produced a significant chemical reaction in participants. By contrast, when the same gamblers later played blackjack for points, not money, there was very little chemical response.</p> <p>The discovery is the strongest indication to date that gambling is addictive behaviour which produces chemical changes in the body, which are more than a simple psychological response to a pleasurable habit.</p> <p>News of the research comes as it was revealed that English footballers had indulged in high-stake late-night card games before big games. The German research suggests that by gambling, team members were producing chemical changes in their bodies as great as those triggered by drugs or drink. Hence their dismal record on the pitch.</p> <p>'Gambling gives a real thrill; you can detect that chemically,' said project leader Gerhard Meyer. 'You get a buzz when you put down the bet. If you win you feel great, and want to do it again. If you lose, you know you can put down another bet very quickly, and hopefully win then. That is the great thing about casinos: speed of feedback.'</p> <p>The Bremen group recruited 10 regular gamblers at a state-registered casino. Each had their heart rate monitored, and also provided saliva samples every half-hour during a two-hour gambling session. Each used their own money as stakes. 'The saliva was analysed for cortisol - a hormone released when a person comes under stress,' said Meyer. 'Gamblers' cortisol and heart rate levels both rose significantly under real casino conditions. By contrast, when we asked them to play for points, we found very little rise in heart beat or cortisol.'</p> <p>In short, gambling for real stakes seems to produce chemical reactions that parallel those induced by nicotine, alcohol or cocaine. These drugs cause the brain to release substances such as dopamine and serotonin and these stimulate other nerve cells to produce responses that are experienced as pleasurable. Gambling acts as a behavioural surrogate for these drugs, creating euphoria but also triggering a biochemical cascade through the body. Meyer 's team have now successfully measured one of the products of that cascade: raised cortisol levels in saliva.</p> <p>The team now plans to measure other hormones such as adrenaline in gamblers' blood.</p> <p>Meyer said: 'As a result, we should be able to measure drugs that are released by brains of gamblers as they win or lose. The more that we find out about these pathways, the more chance we have of developing drugs that can block, and ultimately help gamblers kick the habit.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gambling is as addictive as smoking or drug-taking, say researchers who have monitored hormone levels in blackjack players in a casino. The group - from Bremen University - discovered that games played for cash, produced a significant chemical reaction in participants. By contrast, when the same gamblers later played blackjack for points, not money, there was very little chemical response. The discovery is the strongest indication to date that gambling is addictive behaviour which produces chemical changes in the body, which are more than a simple psychological response to a pleasurable habit. News of the research comes as it was revealed that English footballers had indulged in high-stake late-night card games before big games. The German research suggests that by gambling, team members were producing chemical changes in their bodies as great as those triggered by drugs or drink. Hence their dismal record on the pitch. 'Gambling gives a real thrill; you can detect that chemically,' said project leader Gerhard Meyer. 'You get a buzz when you put down the bet. If you win you feel great, and want to do it again. If you lose, you know you can put down another bet very quickly, and hopefully win then. That is the great thing about casinos: speed of feedback.' The Bremen group recruited 10 regular gamblers at a state-registered casino. Each had their heart rate monitored, and also provided saliva samples every half-hour during a two-hour gambling session. Each used their own money as stakes. 'The saliva was analysed for cortisol - a hormone released when a person comes under stress,' said Meyer. 'Gamblers' cortisol and heart rate levels both rose significantly under real casino conditions. By contrast, when we asked them to play for points, we found very little rise in heart beat or cortisol.' In short, gambling for real stakes seems to produce chemical reactions that parallel those induced by nicotine, alcohol or cocaine. These drugs cause the brain to release substances such as dopamine and serotonin and these stimulate other nerve cells to produce responses that are experienced as pleasurable. Gambling acts as a behavioural surrogate for these drugs, creating euphoria but also triggering a biochemical cascade through the body. Meyer 's team have now successfully measured one of the products of that cascade: raised cortisol levels in saliva. The team now plans to measure other hormones such as adrenaline in gamblers' blood. Meyer said: 'As a result, we should be able to measure drugs that are released by brains of gamblers as they win or lose. The more that we find out about these pathways, the more chance we have of developing drugs that can block, and ultimately help gamblers kick the habit.'",

The museum has been accused of just about everything from dereliction of duty to bad faith in its attempts to make good the hole torn out of its heart by the departure of the British Library for St Pancras. The project used the wrong stone; the museum was playing fast and loose with planning permission by building too high. There was even, so the London Evening Standard claims, a conspiracy to unload a consignment of inferior French stone on Britain's greatest museum at a premium price, followed by a witchhunt to find the mole who had been leaking confidential documents about the story. </p> <p>With its unlikely pairing of rumpled academic Robert Anderson, as director, and the svelte City type Suzanna Taverne, as managing director, operating as a kind of dual monarchy, the museum is clearly carrying on its centuries-long tradition as a hotbed of internecine strife and intrigue. Then, last week, Jocelyn Stevens, the excitable former head of English Heritage joined the fight, calling for the resignation of Graham Greene, chairman of the trustees, over what he claimed was the failure of the museum to treat its building - Sir Robert Smirke's grade one-listed masterpiece - with sufficient respect. </p> <p>The Millennium Bridge, an equally high-profile project also designed by Norman Foster, and opened by the Queen earlier this year, faced a wave of derision when it failed to meet expectations aroused by the pre-opening publicity and stubbornly refused to stop wobbling. What had been presented as a triumph suddenly turned into yet another millennium fiasco. Pre-opening expectations for the Great Court have been so low that, short of a technical disaster in the high-tech, glass-and-steel roof, the museum must be hoping that when the Queen finally declares the project open, exactly the opposite will happen. </p> <p>From the ferocity of Stevens's attack, you could be forgiven for expecting the Great Court to turn out to be a piece of Disney-style conservation. But architecturally, the Great Court, already clearly visible to anybody who takes a stroll through the King's Library, is a triumph. As a public space, it is nothing short of magnificent. Yet with a wilful determination not to see the wood for the trees, Stevens has focused entirely on the newly constructed stone portico that is the centrepiece of the south side of the courtyard. </p> <p>He claims that the trustees knew that the stone being used was not the Portland stone specified in the contract, but was, in fact, a cheaper French substitute, which might meet the letter of the specification but wasn't what Sir Robert Smirke had selected when he designed the museum in 1823. </p> <p>Stevens wants the royal opening postponed for a year or two while the offending stone work is demolished and rebuilt using genuine Portland. Stevens is no stranger to multiple postponements. In all his years as the chairman of English Heritage, he singularly failed to resolve what he himself called the scandalous state of Britain's greatest archaeological treasure that was under his care, Stonehenge. He left behind a fiasco of abandoned architectural competitions and futile attempts at privately funded visitors' centres which were all scrapped by his successor at English Heritage. It is going to be at least another six years before the mess at Stonehenge is finally sorted out. In rather less time, the museum has raised the money to complete the huge restructuring that the Great Court has entailed. </p> <p>Sooner or later, the stone episode will join the abundant lore of colourful tales that have always been part of the museum's history. The magnificent main fa\u00e7ade, for example, was built in the 1840s by Baker and Sons, a firm that hadn't submitted the lowest tender for the job, but which, according to Jo Mordaunt Crook's riveting architectural history of the museum, did have the vital qualification of a managing director married to the architect's sister. </p> <p>The arguments about authenticity simply do not stack up. The courtyard didn't get built in one go - it took almost 25 years to finish. It would never have been entirely uniform, and it isn't now. It shows the wear and the scars of the passing of time. </p> <p>The courtyard only existed in its original state for the seven years from 1847 to 1854. Bigger than Hanover Square, at almost two acres, but according to Thomas Watts, assistant to the great librarian of the British Museum, Anthony Panizzi, 'a dead loss'. Another critic dubbed it the 'finest mason's yard in Europe'. The public were excluded from what was, by one account, 'a mere well of malaria, a pestilent congregation of vapours'. </p> <p>The original portico was hacked about to insert the Reading Room, and when the museum was subject to the tender care of the Ministry of Public Building and Works there was constant damage of bodged alterations carried out with all the tenderness of an army of occupation. There was bomb damage during the Second World War from a hail of incendiaries, missiles and water penetration. </p> <p>If you are rebuilding architecture with such a complex history, what do you restore? Smirke had wanted an open courtyard, so do you demolish the Reading Room - the cuckoo planted in the nest -in the interests of authenticity? Or do you plough it up and devote it to growing exotic botanical specimens, as Smirke had originally wanted; clearly not. Do you restore the porticoes around the courtyard to the way that they were actually built or do you rebuild them in the manner that Smirke would have built them had he got the chance and the cash? Until 1833, Smirke had intended the main quadrangle fa\u00e7ades to carry fairly elaborate porticoes. </p> <p>To get to the north wing, visitors would have come through the triumphant colonnade at the front of the museum, negotiated the entrance hall; gone out through the south portico, crossed the courtyard, and mounted an imposing flight of steps and pass through another, even more, impressive portico. Economy reduced them from the majestic to stage scenery. </p> <p>The portico as built has been attacked for its materials and its workmanship. But it seems to have escaped the critics' attention that the portico itself is not a reconstruction of Smirke; it is a completely new design by Foster that has been produced to deal with the contemporary realities. Its deep, central opening, and the square light at the upper level to give museum visitors a glimpse into the space, have no historical precedent; </p> <p>Historical accuracy has always been a two-edged sword in architectural restoration projects. In the nineteenth century, William Morris set up the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings to prevent over-enthusiastic restoration that took the form of demolishing perpendicular additions to early English gothic cathedrals, in order to reconstruct them more accurately as they ought to have been. To Morris, this would diminish the integrity of those fragments of the building that were genuine. And the strategy that he argued for was patching up, mending, but not pretending that the new work was anything but new. Perhaps, more by accident than by design, that is exactly what has happened at the British Museum. </p> <p>Foster's Great Court is not what Smirke designed, but it will give visitors the kind of spatial thrills that Smike had intended. You will be able to move from the richly painted entrance hall into a sudden explosion of light and space beyond, under a remarkable, billowing glass-and-steel roof that deals with the extraordinarily difficult task of accommodating a rectangular courtyard at the same time as allowing the circular Reading Room to poke through it. No two of the triangular panels are exactly the same. </p> <p>A mousehole entrance in the newly stone-faced Reading Room - this time it comes from Spain - takes you back a century into the most famous library in the world, its original bookstacks, desks and furniture intact. At the north side of the drum, the Reading Room sprouts a bustle to accommodate a series of curved terraces that cascade down from the top level. There are caf\u00e9s, restaurants and shops here. Then, through the second portico, you move on into the old north Reading Room, put to use as a temporary exhibition space and out into the street. It is that route that creates the other great new meaning for the museum; the project is not just a question of patching up the aftermath of wrenching out the British Library, nor is it only a matter of creating a new circulation route that allows the 5.4 million visitors each year to negotiate the museum without turning the galleries into busy corridors. </p> <p>The Great Court is a fundamentally urban project. It provides a new pedestrian route to move through London, from Bloomsbury down to Covent Garden, by way of the Great Court and the newly cleared forecourt to the museum. It gives a taste of what Foster's project for the traffic-free Trafalgar Square could be. As the museum and its architects wait with some anxiety for the public's response, it's worth remembering the reaction to the completion of the original museum. </p> <p>The Architects Journal of 1841 tore into the project: 'Sir Robert Smirke may been an excellent warehouse builder; but let him stick to that task, and not foist upon the country such a dowdy design as the one concocted for the British Museum'.

      "body": "<p><strong> Harry, He's Here To Help</strong> (117 mins, 15) <br>Directed by Dominik Moll; starring Laurent Lucas, Mathilde Seigner, Sergi Lopez, Sophie Guillemin </p> <p> As a film-maker, an influence and a physical presence (the only non-acting director to be recognisable the world over), Alfred Hitchcock has loomed over moviegoers for 70 years. The fascination with his life and work shows no signs of abating. When he was 60, there was just one book about him, written in French by Claude Chabrol and Eric Rohmer. There were half-a-dozen or so by the time of his death in 1980, and there's now a little library of studies, with extra space to be found on the shelves each year. </p> <p>The massive publicity attending the centenary of his birth in 1999 did little to stem the flow of interest. Last month saw the publication by the BFI of Susan Smith's Hitchcock: Suspense, Humour and Tone, and the release of Robert Zemeckis's What Lies Beneath, a homage to Rear Window . </p> <p>Later this month Faber will publish Peter Conrad's perceptive The Hitchcock Murders, and this week Dominik Moll's thriller Harry, He's Here to Help arrives in our cinemas, confirming that Hitchcock's legacy is in good hands down in the Auvergne. </p> <p>The film begins with an edgy casualness. One hot summer day, the 34-year-old Michel Pape (Laurent Lucas), a good-looking teacher of French to Japanese students, is driving south from Paris in his clapped-out saloon with his sensible wife, Claire (Mathilde Seigner), and three fractious little daughters. Their destination is the dilapidated old farmhouse on the foothills of the Monts du Cantal that they've bought with the help of his overbearing dentist father and his querulous mother and are doing up a little at a time. </p> <p>Like various Hitchcock characters, their lives are inviting intervention. In the men's lavatory at a motorway caf\u00e9, a good-looking, slightly flashy man introduces himself to Michel as an old friend he's not met for 20 years and who remembers their schooldays in astonishing detail. This stranger by a drain is called Harry Balestrero (Sergi Lopez), a name designed to set off alarm bells in the viewer's mind. Balestrero is the name of the innocent victim in The Wrong Man ; Harry is the corpse that causes trouble in Vermont in Hitchcock's most extended exercise in rural mayhem in The Trouble With Harry. </p> <p>Harry, like Bruno in Strangers on a Train, is idle, aesthetically poised and independently wealthy, having inherited large sums from a despised father. Accompanied by his simple, sexy, patronised girlfriend (Sophie Guillemin), he insinuates himself into the lives of Michel, Claire and their children, sensing faultlines in their relationships and creating new ones. It begins with lollies for the kids, a lift in his air-conditioned Mercedes and a flattering concern for Michel having given up on the literary career that seemed to lie before him as a precocious schoolboy. </p> <p>Harry's one of those people who knows more about you than you know yourself and is solicitous to an embarrassing degree. He believes 'every problem has a solution' and sets about reorgan ising Michel's life with advice and manipulative acts. Because Michel and Claire don't present a united front, he's able to become a murderous cuckoo in their nest. </p> <p>As with Hitchcock and Fritz Lang, there's a deadly logic in the way one act leads plausibly to another on the escalator of will and desire, and with considerable subtlety Moll draws us into Harry's scheming mind.

      "bodyText": "Harry, He's Here To Help (117 mins, 15) Directed by Dominik Moll; starring Laurent Lucas, Mathilde Seigner, Sergi Lopez, Sophie Guillemin As a film-maker, an influence and a physical presence (the only non-acting director to be recognisable the world over), Alfred Hitchcock has loomed over moviegoers for 70 years. The fascination with his life and work shows no signs of abating. When he was 60, there was just one book about him, written in French by Claude Chabrol and Eric Rohmer. There were half-a-dozen or so by the time of his death in 1980, and there's now a little library of studies, with extra space to be found on the shelves each year. The massive publicity attending the centenary of his birth in 1999 did little to stem the flow of interest. Last month saw the publication by the BFI of Susan Smith's Hitchcock: Suspense, Humour and Tone, and the release of Robert Zemeckis's What Lies Beneath, a homage to Rear Window . Later this month Faber will publish Peter Conrad's perceptive The Hitchcock Murders, and this week Dominik Moll's thriller Harry, He's Here to Help arrives in our cinemas, confirming that Hitchcock's legacy is in good hands down in the Auvergne. The film begins with an edgy casualness. One hot summer day, the 34-year-old Michel Pape (Laurent Lucas), a good-looking teacher of French to Japanese students, is driving south from Paris in his clapped-out saloon with his sensible wife, Claire (Mathilde Seigner), and three fractious little daughters.

Leo is praised for taking the rap alone and not ratting on his glamorous chum, Willie (Joaquin Phoenix), and his aunt's new husband, a prosperous manufacturer of railway equipment, (James Caan), who suggests he take a mechanical apprenticeship for two years. </p> <p>But Leo needs an immediate income to support his proud, ailing mother (Ellen Burstyn).

But he's then relentlessly pursued by the squirmingly embarrassing Buck. We anticipate acts of violence. Instead, Buck writes a fairy tale play called Hank and Frank and strikes up a benign friendship with the middle-aged Hispanic woman (Lupe Ontiveros) who produces it at a children's theatre. </p> <p> Chuck and Buck is an oddity from some very clever writers, accompanied by a 12-minute short by some other clever people. Paul Merton's The Suicidal Dog is a misanthropic comedy about the revenge enacted on a dislikeable, lower-middle-class Londoner by his neglected wife and his neutered terrier. The film is photographed by Britain's greatest Technicolor cameraman, the 86-year-old Jack Cardiff, who made his screen debut 82 years ago at the age of four and makes a fleeting appearance here at a funfair. </p> <p>After the phenomenal success of The Sixth Sense , Bruce Willis must have been looking for another mystical screenplay involving himself and a child, though his own sixth sense should have told him that <strong> Disney's The Kid </strong> wasn't what he needed. </p> <p>Presumably named to prevent confusion with Chaplin's The Kid, this whimsical comedy involves a workaholic Los Angeles image consultant being confronted by his eight-year-old self on the eve of his fortieth birthday. The plump lad has travelled through time to tell him that for all his apparent worldly success he hasn't become what his earlier self wanted to be, ie a married jet pilot with a family and a dog called Chester.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> French and Saunders - Live in 2000 </strong><br> Hammersmith Apollo until 18 November, then touring </p> <p>After a decade on television, Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders have burst out of the box. Half-way through a national tour, their stage show, French &amp; Saunders - Live in 2000, is now at the Apollo in Hammersmith. To their credit, they don't pretend, like the washed-up film stars currently busking in West End theatres, to have made the change because they crave contact with the public. French brusquely explains why they have ventured out of the tube: 'We have conservatories to pay for.' And what's a conservatory but a glazed, impenetrable shield, like a television screen? </p> <p>In the show, they appear in person only as a last resort. After introductory fanfares, a TV set is trundled on to the stage. An amoeboid French and an insect-like Saunders greet us from its insulating screen. They begin with a supercilious reminder that we're pathetically real while they enjoy the virtual existence of celebrities. 'We're on television,' snaps French, 'you're not.' Only when the TV set blows up are they hauled out of hiding, annoyed at having to confront us. </p> <p>Throughout the evening, they seem to be longing for a chance to retreat into the safety of the box, where success is guaranteed by a sycophantic track of pre-recorded laughter. Most of the sketches parody tabloid television programmes like Big Brother or Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, and the show ends with a screened anthology of clips from their BBC series, featuring routines based on films like The Exorcist or Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? The best joke of the evening is about a film, and it's shown on video. French, a gawky, giggling Hollywood reporter for a breakfast TV programme, attempts to interview the star of the sequel to Gladiator, who turns out to be Ann Widdecombe (French herself again, of course), with armoured boobs and a stentorian manner even more belligerent than Russell Crowe's. </p> <p>There's a single, brief excursion into the dangerous unpredictability of live performance, when French top-heavily clambers down into the audience, supposedly to root out illicit guzzlers of chocolate bars. Interestingly, Saunders upbraids her for breaking the rules by recognising our existence. 'Don't do this!' she barks, as her partner wobbles on the stepladder which leads to the stalls. People all around me shrank when French approached, tracked by video cameras. </p> <p>But unlike Dame Edna on her predatory sorties into our lower depths, French doesn't engage with the paying public. She removes a suitcase-sized slab of Dairy Milk from an accomplice planted on an aisle, then scurries back onto the stage, which, painted white, comfortingly resembles a television studio. </p> <p>Thanks to Simon McBurney's ingenious direction, French and Saunders are able to play a series of duets with larger-than-life video facsimiles of themselves, projected on to the set's blank walls.

      "bodyText": "French and Saunders - Live in 2000 Hammersmith Apollo until 18 November, then touring After a decade on television, Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders have burst out of the box. Half-way through a national tour, their stage show, French &amp; Saunders - Live in 2000, is now at the Apollo in Hammersmith. To their credit, they don't pretend, like the washed-up film stars currently busking in West End theatres, to have made the change because they crave contact with the public. French brusquely explains why they have ventured out of the tube: 'We have conservatories to pay for.' And what's a conservatory but a glazed, impenetrable shield, like a television screen? In the show, they appear in person only as a last resort. After introductory fanfares, a TV set is trundled on to the stage. An amoeboid French and an insect-like Saunders greet us from its insulating screen. They begin with a supercilious reminder that we're pathetically real while they enjoy the virtual existence of celebrities. 'We're on television,' snaps French, 'you're not.' Only when the TV set blows up are they hauled out of hiding, annoyed at having to confront us. Throughout the evening, they seem to be longing for a chance to retreat into the safety of the box, where success is guaranteed by a sycophantic track of pre-recorded laughter. Most of the sketches parody tabloid television programmes like Big Brother or Who Wants to be a Millionaire?, and the show ends with a screened anthology of clips from their BBC series, featuring routines based on films like The Exorcist or Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? The best joke of the evening is about a film, and it's shown on video. French, a gawky, giggling Hollywood reporter for a breakfast TV programme, attempts to interview the star of the sequel to Gladiator, who turns out to be Ann Widdecombe (French herself again, of course), with armoured boobs and a stentorian manner even more belligerent than Russell Crowe's. There's a single, brief excursion into the dangerous unpredictability of live performance, when French top-heavily clambers down into the audience, supposedly to root out illicit guzzlers of chocolate bars. Interestingly, Saunders upbraids her for breaking the rules by recognising our existence. 'Don't do this!' she barks, as her partner wobbles on the stepladder which leads to the stalls. People all around me shrank when French approached, tracked by video cameras. But unlike Dame Edna on her predatory sorties into our lower depths, French doesn't engage with the paying public. She removes a suitcase-sized slab of Dairy Milk from an accomplice planted on an aisle, then scurries back onto the stage, which, painted white, comfortingly resembles a television studio. Thanks to Simon McBurney's ingenious direction, French and Saunders are able to play a series of duets with larger-than-life video facsimiles of themselves, projected on to the set's blank walls. In the Casualty spoof, they commute between stage and screen. As a pair of extras, they huddle in the wings daubing themselves with gruesome wounds, then gatecrash a scene in the medical drama, to the consternation of the pre-recorded actors. The sketch with the gossip columnist's report from Hollywood is also an accident-prone exchange between Saunders on stage (supposedly in a TV studio) and French on screen (supposedly live in LA, though she's merely posed against a slide of palm trees). It ends as they deal with an impromptu emergency: 30 seconds of dead air, which they hadn't budgeted for. As a digital clock slowly ticks in the corner of the screen, Saunders squirms and French yawns. A good joke, but it perhaps reveals how uninterested they are in responding to momentary mischances, which ought to be the enlivening energy of stand-up comedy. The show's introversion, sealed inside its small televisual world, is confirmed by its electronic gimmickry.

In the thunderous third work, <b> La Navarraise</b>, Massenet moves into verismo territory. The setting is the Carlist wars of 1874. A large orchestra belts our noisy tunes, just heard above the sound effects of battle.

Only as he dies does he realise the truth: she's merely a murderer, not an adulterer. Oh the relief. She goes mad, laughs raucously over his corpse and collapses. This was a showpiece for Gweneth-Ann Jeffers as Anita, an exciting dramatic soprano and a name to watch. Clive Timms conducted, and the Guildhall Orchestra played with agreeably unruly verve.

That is to say, staying power. Bishop caught in brothel, politician caught taking bribe, Russian spy found in massage parlour with expired Visa card - these are over in a day. So the best way to begin is with a whopping lie, told by the politician concerned, that has to be peeled away like an onion and which discloses other scandalous things that nobody was even looking for. Watergate began with a burglary and ended with the disclosure that every conversation in Nixon's Oval Office was taped.

      "bodyText": "It must have money. It must have high-level skullduggery. It must show the powers that be as hypocritical fools. (The Reaganites had always said that they would never, but NEVER, negotiate with terrorists.) It should have sex or, if that's not possible, it should have a sex symbol. It should also have a name. The perfect name was, of course, Watergate, and since then the race has been on to add a 'gate' suffix to any old fiasco. The tactic was originally evolved by William Safire, once a Nixon speechwriter and now a columnist, who hoped to minimise his boss's crimes. So one ought to be careful. But the fact is that the 'gate' business is irresistible. And when it was discovered that Monica Lewinsky actually lived in the Watergate building, well, what can you do? A scandal should also have what journalists call 'legs'. That is to say, staying power. Bishop caught in brothel, politician caught taking bribe, Russian spy found in massage parlour with expired Visa card - these are over in a day. So the best way to begin is with a whopping lie, told by the politician concerned, that has to be peeled away like an onion and which discloses other scandalous things that nobody was even looking for. Watergate began with a burglary and ended with the disclosure that every conversation in Nixon's Oval Office was taped.

It was not entirely a culture shock because in Cairo I had been to the English School, where the Egyptian cooks gave us roast beef with gravy and Yorkshire pudding, steak and kidney pie, and jelly with custard.</p> <p>The British did not like foreign food. Lord Carnarvon had regular hampers sent over from Harrods to Egypt and the excavator Flinders Petry, who could not afford Harrods hampers, lived on tins. Because of the heat, these were dangerous. He would throw the tin at the wall, and if it exploded he would not eat it.</p> <p>When I started working on A Book of Middle Eastern Food in the late 60s, people would ask: 'Is it about sheep's eyeballs and testicles?' Looking at the first edition, I see substitutes for everything: 'If you can't find chickpeas, use beans' and explanations such as: 'Courgettes are baby marrows.' Our greatest treat then was to eat spaghetti Bolognese in Soho coffee houses, and mezze and grills in Cypriot kebab houses in Camden Town.</p> <p>Today, British tastes have changed. London is one of the food capitals of the world. Every type of restaurant and food shop is represented. Going to east London's Stoke Newington and Green Lanes is like stepping into Turkey or Cyprus. The East End, Southall and Wembley in north London are a little India and little Pakistan, and Chinatown in Soho keeps expanding its borders. You even have Japanese supermarkets in the suburbs. (It's hard to believe that only a decade ago hardly anyone here would let raw fish pass their lips.)</p> <p>Britain is the country which has, more than any other, adopted and integrated its immigrant cuisines (compare it to France and Italy, which have not integrated foreign foods). And people here are the most adventurous cooks in the world. They will attempt anything, and they carry it off very well. You can find hundreds of cookery books on every kind of food. When an ethnic dish is demonstrated on television, you'll find it at hundreds of dinner parties in the following weeks.</p> <p>From bulgur and couscous to lemon-grass, okra and all kinds of unusual pasta, our supermarkets have a huge variety of ingredients never seen before. The chilled-food range at my local Marks &amp; Spencer is like an ethnic-food emporium. Italian is the biggest seller, then comes Chinese, and Indian chicken tikka masala - chargrilled chicken in a creamy sauce - is the most popular Indian dish here, though Waitrose doesn't do it because it's not authentic. After Indian comes Middle Eastern (my mother was surprised once to find, at a friend's house, that some of the bought savouries were like hers).</p> <p>Not long ago the British found Indian cooking smells so nauseous that they would not consider living next to an Asian family. Now curry is the national dish and chicken tikka is the nation's favourite sandwich. Curry houses, balti restaurants and Indian takeaways account for \u00a32.5bn of trade. The Indian meal has become part of the British way of life, with football fans singing, 'Vindaloo! Vindaloo!'</p> <p>The Jews had an early influence on the cooking of Britain. Fish and chips is their legacy. In 1968, the National Federation of Fish Friers presented a commemorative plaque to Malin's of Bow in the East End. Joseph Malin, newly arrived from eastern Europe, was the first to sell chips with fried fish in 1860. Following his example, Jewish fish and chip shops opened all around the country. Smoked salmon was the prime Jewish delicacy in Britain at the turn of the century. It was immigrants from Russia who brought the smoking techniques to London. Soon after the Second World War, immigrants from Vienna and Hungary opened pastry shops and coffee houses that popularised apple strudel, cheesecake and Danish pastries.</p> <p>Middle Eastern, too, has become part of our own eclectic cooking, partly as a result of the Lebanese civil war and the revolution in Iran. Star chefs such as Peter Gordon, Alastair Little and the Clarks at Moro in Clerkenwell, serve Egyptian lentil soup, Lebanese tabbouleh, Moroccan pastilla, and all kinds of tagines and brik.</p> <p>Food seems to be that part of an immigrant culture that immigrants hold on to longest - when they have abandoned the traditional dress, the language, the music. Instead of marginalising it, Britain has absorbed it and made it its own. Our cooking has become a true melting pot - the joint heritage of our multicultural society.</p>",

Our greatest treat then was to eat spaghetti Bolognese in Soho coffee houses, and mezze and grills in Cypriot kebab houses in Camden Town. Today, British tastes have changed. London is one of the food capitals of the world. Every type of restaurant and food shop is represented. Going to east London's Stoke Newington and Green Lanes is like stepping into Turkey or Cyprus. The East End, Southall and Wembley in north London are a little India and little Pakistan, and Chinatown in Soho keeps expanding its borders. You even have Japanese supermarkets in the suburbs. (It's hard to believe that only a decade ago hardly anyone here would let raw fish pass their lips.) Britain is the country which has, more than any other, adopted and integrated its immigrant cuisines (compare it to France and Italy, which have not integrated foreign foods). And people here are the most adventurous cooks in the world. They will attempt anything, and they carry it off very well. You can find hundreds of cookery books on every kind of food. When an ethnic dish is demonstrated on television, you'll find it at hundreds of dinner parties in the following weeks. From bulgur and couscous to lemon-grass, okra and all kinds of unusual pasta, our supermarkets have a huge variety of ingredients never seen before. The chilled-food range at my local Marks &amp; Spencer is like an ethnic-food emporium. Italian is the biggest seller, then comes Chinese, and Indian chicken tikka masala - chargrilled chicken in a creamy sauce - is the most popular Indian dish here, though Waitrose doesn't do it because it's not authentic. After Indian comes Middle Eastern (my mother was surprised once to find, at a friend's house, that some of the bought savouries were like hers). Not long ago the British found Indian cooking smells so nauseous that they would not consider living next to an Asian family. Now curry is the national dish and chicken tikka is the nation's favourite sandwich. Curry houses, balti restaurants and Indian takeaways account for \u00a32.5bn of trade. The Indian meal has become part of the British way of life, with football fans singing, 'Vindaloo! Vindaloo!' The Jews had an early influence on the cooking of Britain. Fish and chips is their legacy. In 1968, the National Federation of Fish Friers presented a commemorative plaque to Malin's of Bow in the East End. Joseph Malin, newly arrived from eastern Europe, was the first to sell chips with fried fish in 1860. Following his example, Jewish fish and chip shops opened all around the country. Smoked salmon was the prime Jewish delicacy in Britain at the turn of the century. It was immigrants from Russia who brought the smoking techniques to London. Soon after the Second World War, immigrants from Vienna and Hungary opened pastry shops and coffee houses that popularised apple strudel, cheesecake and Danish pastries. Middle Eastern, too, has become part of our own eclectic cooking, partly as a result of the Lebanese civil war and the revolution in Iran. Star chefs such as Peter Gordon, Alastair Little and the Clarks at Moro in Clerkenwell, serve Egyptian lentil soup, Lebanese tabbouleh, Moroccan pastilla, and all kinds of tagines and brik. Food seems to be that part of an immigrant culture that immigrants hold on to longest - when they have abandoned the traditional dress, the language, the music. Instead of marginalising it, Britain has absorbed it and made it its own. Our cooking has become a true melting pot - the joint heritage of our multicultural society.",

      "body": "<p>It's a blustery morning in a Liverpool suburb and I'm accompanying the government's drugs tsar Keith Hellawell into the centre of a major international drugs organisation. It's a bit disappointing, really. A small, cramped office with four tatty desks and headache-inducing strip lighting. Here, unpaid volunteers offer phone counselling to desperate people from all over the UK and abroad. The callers tell the familiar stories of addiction. The shame. The misery. The lies to friends and family. A volunteer shows Hellawell an entry in her log detailing one addict's prodigious chemical intake, and he shakes his head. 'It's amazing what the human body can put up with.' Another - a former addict himself - talks of people committing suicide due to sudden withdrawal. </p> <p>But it isn't what you may think. This is the Council for Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction, and the mind-altering substances they deal with are perfectly legal - given by doctors to help with sleeplessness or stress. It may surprise you that the government's Anti-Drugs Coordinator sees this as part of his remit. (He hates the term 'tsar', by the way, and gently corrects anyone who uses it.) But he is clear that it is. 'We shouldn't distinguish between substances,' he says. 'Just because it's prescribed and legal doesn't make it safe.' </p> <p>Our first meeting a few days earlier hadn't gone particularly well. We'd met in his shabbily grand wood-panelled room in the Cabinet Office. Hellawell was running late, and my scheduled two hours had been whittled down to one. He was courteous, talkative, expounding on his 10-year plan for tackling drugs, but the whole thing felt like sliding on a polished surface without ever seeing what lay beneath. When I suggested following him around for a few days, he seemed almost boyishly keen. 'People are surprised at how the community takes to me. They think I sit in an office, but I'm always out.' </p> <p>In Liverpool, it's easy to see why he was so enthusiastic. Imposing without ever being intimidating, Hellawell is good at the kind of bland jokes and pleasantries that put people at ease. He asks intelligent questions and listens carefully to the answers, making notes to take back to the relevant ministers. In the car afterwards, he feels this visit went well. Sometimes when he sees small voluntary groups, frustrations bubble over and he can feel like he's under attack. 'It's as if you should have gone in wearing body armour.' </p> <p>Nonetheless, Hellawell feels that such visits are a crucial part of his job, to explain his strategies and show people that he is listening. In the media, his rather mild and sensible views are often portrayed as 'controversial'. To many in the drugs field, impatient for a more radical agenda, he's a patsy put in place by a government with no idea how to react to the fact that drugs have become just another leisure activity. 'He's the Princess Di of the chemical generation,' says one cynic, 'travelling around the country getting his picture taken and giving out sympathy.' </p> <p>Drugs. A simple five-letter word, but one of our most emotive. Put it on the cover of a youth magazine, and you sell thousands more copies. Put it in a newspaper headline, and you have a story that thrills and frightens. Shout it out at the Tory conference with a promise of new penalties, and you have them eating out of your hand. (Although recent events may have changed that.) Hellawell himself rarely uses the word, preferring the more neutral 'substances'. The education programmes he plans for schools cover everything from the solvents that kill around 80 children a year to the biggest killers, alcohol and tobacco, as well as the illegal substances most people think of when they hear the word drugs. In his strategy documents, he stresses too that not all substances are equally bad: the emphasis is firmly on what he calls 'the drugs that actually do cause the pain and harm and criminality' - heroin and cocaine. </p> <p>Hellawell recalls the first drugs deaths he saw. He was a raw young police officer then, and didn't even know what heroin was. They were a husband and wife from Huddersfield - both doctors, one of the few groups with access to the substance in the early 60s - and he remembers looking at their emaciated bodies, wondering why intelligent people might do this to themselves. We'd be wrong to read too much into it, he says; this wasn't a pivotal moment for him. Police officers see all kinds of things the rest of us don't. </p> <p>Early in his police career, the consensus was that the best way to deal with drugs was to arrest everyone for everything. 'We were very intolerant,' he says. 'We'd take the contents of somebody's handbag or pockets and even tiny grains, if it could be proved that it was cannabis we would prosecute, feeling that we could criminalise it out of the system. Clearly, we didn't. And that doesn't address the issues of attraction to drugs, of people being destroyed by drugs.' He no longer believes that locking people up is the solution. Put an addict through successful treatment, he says, and you stop them committing crimes to finance their habit. Or dealing and creating new users. You improve their lives, but also the lives of their families and the community in which they live. He's negotiated more money for treatment than ever before. So much that he claims the problem now is not lack of funds for detox projects, but a shortage of trained staff to run them. </p> <p>Sefton, Merseyside. The Independence Initiative is an innovative community detox project. As the director gives a presentation on their work, Hellawell sits on the edge of his seat, completely absorbed. Afterwards, he gives a speech. He always talks off the cuff, which worries his wife Brenda before big events. But he finds it easier that way, more natural. He stresses his continuing support for treatment but also explains new initiatives to seize drugs and the money made from selling them. As well as detecting drugs coming into the country, they've trained dogs to find large wads of money going out. In 12 weeks at Heathrow, two dogs helped customs confiscate \u00a310m. Hellawell repeats this figure gleefully. 'Twelve weeks. One airport. Two dogs. Ten million.' All I can think is how much cash must be flowing out of other airports, as well as on ferries and trains, and how it could ever be possible to halt such a lucrative trade. </p> <p>While Hellawell fields more questions about cannabis from local journalists, I talk to Dene, one of the project's successes. Until recently, he was in a wheelchair. He's been dead once - the hospital had to restart his heart. Dene was lucky. This flagship project didn't just help him detox. They encouraged him to join a gym, and build up his wasted muscles. He found an interest in photography. Before, his only friends were other junkies. But the project helped him forge a new social life, and even though his brother lived with him and was still using, he wasn't tempted back on to the gear. Now he's walking with a stick, enjoying his life, thinking of giving up cigarettes. 'My only remaining vice,' he says proudly. </p> <p>Before leaving, Hellawell makes a point of coming over to shake Dene's hand. Someone later tells me that, on his first visits to Merseyside, he caused a stir by talking more with the drug users and their families than the assembled suits. Everywhere I saw him go, he made time for the addicts and their families. He didn't judge, he didn't patronise, he didn't gush with sympathy. He talks to them as people, he shrugs. 'That's just how I am.' </p> <p>Keith Hellawell was born in Holmfirth, Huddersfield on 18 May 1942. He's uncomfortable talking about his background, though sometimes he'll mention it briefly, just to make sure people know he's not too grand. His dad was a baker, his mother a mill-worker who moonlighted as a singer. They separated when he was four, and he diplomatically describes his childhood as 'difficult'. He was left to fend for himself, and when pressured he'll describe a crowded tenement where violence and petty crime were routine, money was scarce and he learned survival skills early. </p> <p>He went down the local pit at the age of 15, leaving school with a final report that said: 'Keith excelled at sport, and little else.' Five years later, he fulfilled his childhood ambition to become a police officer and soon after married Brenda, who has clearly been a great support. In the force, he seemed to find his calling. He excelled in exams to such a degree that at first he was accused of cheating; when it became obvious that he was a natural, he was fast-tracked through the ranks. By 1965, he was the youngest sergeant in the country; a year later, the youngest inspector. He studied for a degree in law and a MSc in social policy in his own time, and his inexorable rise continued. He was deputy chief constable of Humberside by 1985; chief constable of Cleveland by 1990; chief constable of West Yorkshire by 1993. When I ask if he encountered a lot of resentment as an ex-miner rising through the ranks, he answers without hesitation. 'Yes,' he says. 'But that's life.' </p> <p>What his background seems to have given him was empathy, an understanding of those he policed. He hates what he calls 'inconsistencies', people being treated differently due to class, race or other differences. As chief constable, he closed down police-station bars, saying that if officers wanted to drink, they should go to a pub like everyone else. When the young were being demonised by a Tory government keen for scapegoats, he stated that most juvenile crime was committed by a handful of repeat offenders. He has called for the legalisation of brothels. But most of all, he has spoken about drugs. As early as 1969, he filed a report suggesting setting up a dedicated drugs squad. He spoke for the Association of Chief Police Officers on drugs issues, and was one of the first authority figures to acknowledge that most people took drugs recreationally not because they were weak or stupid, but because it was fun. </p> <p>For a long time, all controlled substances were considered equal. There is a problem with this, Hellawell points out. All drugs are clearly not the same. And legal substances can often cause comparable harm. Although saying such things can be difficult: 'It's still a very highly charged political issue.' </p> <p>But this, in the end, is the contradiction that sank Anne Widdecombe. Slurping champagne onstage after promising \u00a3100 fines for cannabis users was, perhaps, a hypocrisy too far. Hellawell will not be drawn into criticising her personally, though he says he can talk about the issues. 'The extreme zero-tolerance view just won't work.' Still, he sees the debate as a distraction from the real issues. 'Cannabis can't be legalised because the international community says it cannot.' Although some European countries are liberalising their laws, he argues that this isn't necessary in the UK. Most people now caught with cannabis here are simply cautioned. No one is sitting in prison simply for puffing a joint. </p> <p>Later in the week, we drive from his first meeting of the day in Leeds on to Stockton on Tees. In the car with no government press officer present, he seems relaxed for the first time, chatting and sharing interesting facts from his briefing papers. He's still a good-looking man, tall with an affluent tan, a well-groomed moustache, sharp cheekbones and even sharper suits. Until he was 45, he stayed fit by running marathons, but he had to give it up after suffering a severe back injury in a car accident. He often jokes about putting on weight, but although I'm with him for two full days, I never see him eat. He tends to have only an evening meal, he explains, a habit picked up in his first job. If he ate down the pit, bending to work used to make him sick. </p> <p>When the post of Anti-Drugs Coordinator was announced by the New Labour government, it seemed to have been created with Hellawell in mind. In fact, he says he didn't even apply until the last minute, and then only after long discussions with his wife. He was happy in West Yorkshire - it paid well and though the hours could be long, Brenda could accompany him to any evening social engagements he had to attend. But it seemed to both of them that if he could be of service, then he should. His critics carp about his big salary, his lack of real power. They tend to portray him as man addicted to junkets, travelling abroad at the slightest pretext, touring the country in search of publicity while waiting out his time until retirement and the inevitable knighthood. But he wearily tells me he finds the travelling tiring, and he obviously misses his home in the north. His life in London is fairly solitary - by choice, he is quick to add. He describes himself as 'reserved'. When he first took the job, he was invited to parties and functions, but he finds them difficult without his wife at his side. When he has to be in the capital he stays at his club, but whenever possible he goes home to his converted farmhouse with a swimming pool in the Yorkshire countryside. </p> <p>He was 56 when he took the job. When I ask if he's planning to see his 10-year plan through, he laughs at the absurdity of the idea. He has a new three-year contract, but seems to hint that he may not finish it. He sees his job as opening up the debate, establishing budgets, getting the various agencies to work together, setting up structures so that others can take over the work and make it their own. Hellawell serves another useful purpose for the government, of course - he distances them from a difficult issue. </p> <p>So, while the Shadow Cabinet confessed their youthful indiscretions after the Widdecombe debacle, Labour left Hellawell to do the talking. It was he who pointed out that cannabis doesn't always act as a gateway to other drugs, and he who took the resulting flak. The Sun lined up heroin addicts to say they had started on cannabis (which is a bit like an alcoholic insisting that a first sip of cider inevitably leads to meths); the Mail 's headline trumpeted his \u00a3107,000 salary and asked 'What is the point of this man?'. This kind of coverage upsets his family, he says, particularly his son, who often wonders why he doesn't just walk away. </p> <p>He regrets not having more time for his son and two daughters. School plays, parents nights, sports days - Brenda did all of those, he says wistfully, he was never there. There are seven grandchildren now, with twins on the way in two weeks' time, and you get the feeling that he'd rather not be away in London while they grow up. </p> <p>Friday. Stockton-on-Tees Town Hall. The 20 or so people clustered round the council table do not want to talk about cannabis. This area has a large number of heroin addicts, and few resources as yet to help them. 'My son has been on heroin for six years,' says one woman emotionally. 'In my extended family, there are another six on heroin. Their children are growing up now, and seeing it as a way of life. And that is where the dealers are going. They've already got our sons and daughters. Now they're going for our grandchildren.' Hellawell answers points made by GPs, councillors and police officers calmly and clearly. To the addicts' parents, all he can say is that the money is there, that treatment will come. 'It takes time. It just takes time.' </p> <p>Later we drive out to a community centre in nearby Thornaby to listen to the worries of residents. They are quiet, respectable, concerned. The stories they tell are harrowing. Heroin use is epidemic here, and few families are untouched by it. A pretty 17-year-old girl stands up to beg for residential detox. They have no access to such facilities. She quickly dissolves into tears. Painfully thin, she's been on heroin since she was 14. Her boyfriend is also a user. She cannot look after their baby any more, and her mother has had to take over. 'I feel so guilty!' she sobs. 'I don't know why my family puts up with me.' Hellawell has nothing new to offer in the face of such misery. He repeats that the money is there, that treatment is coming. And acknowledges that this is little comfort to people who are living - and dying - with these problems. While the media trawl the toilets in Parliament for grains of cocaine, argue about cannabis, or pretend that Ecstasy is killing our young in droves, this is the reason Hellawell took this post, the real problem he has to address. </p> <p>'Our children are committing slow suicide - we need more than just words,' says Tina Williams, one of the Thornaby mothers. 'Words aren't going to save a life. He might be a nice man, but he's got to deliver.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "It's a blustery morning in a Liverpool suburb and I'm accompanying the government's drugs tsar Keith Hellawell into the centre of a major international drugs organisation. It's a bit disappointing, really. A small, cramped office with four tatty desks and headache-inducing strip lighting. Here, unpaid volunteers offer phone counselling to desperate people from all over the UK and abroad. The callers tell the familiar stories of addiction. The shame. The misery. The lies to friends and family. A volunteer shows Hellawell an entry in her log detailing one addict's prodigious chemical intake, and he shakes his head. 'It's amazing what the human body can put up with.' Another - a former addict himself - talks of people committing suicide due to sudden withdrawal. But it isn't what you may think. This is the Council for Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction, and the mind-altering substances they deal with are perfectly legal - given by doctors to help with sleeplessness or stress. It may surprise you that the government's Anti-Drugs Coordinator sees this as part of his remit. (He hates the term 'tsar', by the way, and gently corrects anyone who uses it.) But he is clear that it is. 'We shouldn't distinguish between substances,' he says. 'Just because it's prescribed and legal doesn't make it safe.' Our first meeting a few days earlier hadn't gone particularly well. We'd met in his shabbily grand wood-panelled room in the Cabinet Office. Hellawell was running late, and my scheduled two hours had been whittled down to one. He was courteous, talkative, expounding on his 10-year plan for tackling drugs, but the whole thing felt like sliding on a polished surface without ever seeing what lay beneath. When I suggested following him around for a few days, he seemed almost boyishly keen. 'People are surprised at how the community takes to me. They think I sit in an office, but I'm always out.' In Liverpool, it's easy to see why he was so enthusiastic. Imposing without ever being intimidating, Hellawell is good at the kind of bland jokes and pleasantries that put people at ease. He asks intelligent questions and listens carefully to the answers, making notes to take back to the relevant ministers. In the car afterwards, he feels this visit went well. Sometimes when he sees small voluntary groups, frustrations bubble over and he can feel like he's under attack. 'It's as if you should have gone in wearing body armour.' Nonetheless, Hellawell feels that such visits are a crucial part of his job, to explain his strategies and show people that he is listening. In the media, his rather mild and sensible views are often portrayed as 'controversial'. To many in the drugs field, impatient for a more radical agenda, he's a patsy put in place by a government with no idea how to react to the fact that drugs have become just another leisure activity. 'He's the Princess Di of the chemical generation,' says one cynic, 'travelling around the country getting his picture taken and giving out sympathy.' Drugs. A simple five-letter word, but one of our most emotive. Put it on the cover of a youth magazine, and you sell thousands more copies. Put it in a newspaper headline, and you have a story that thrills and frightens. Shout it out at the Tory conference with a promise of new penalties, and you have them eating out of your hand. (Although recent events may have changed that.) Hellawell himself rarely uses the word, preferring the more neutral 'substances'. The education programmes he plans for schools cover everything from the solvents that kill around 80 children a year to the biggest killers, alcohol and tobacco, as well as the illegal substances most people think of when they hear the word drugs. In his strategy documents, he stresses too that not all substances are equally bad: the emphasis is firmly on what he calls 'the drugs that actually do cause the pain and harm and criminality' - heroin and cocaine. Hellawell recalls the first drugs deaths he saw. He was a raw young police officer then, and didn't even know what heroin was. They were a husband and wife from Huddersfield - both doctors, one of the few groups with access to the substance in the early 60s - and he remembers looking at their emaciated bodies, wondering why intelligent people might do this to themselves. We'd be wrong to read too much into it, he says; this wasn't a pivotal moment for him. Police officers see all kinds of things the rest of us don't. Early in his police career, the consensus was that the best way to deal with drugs was to arrest everyone for everything. 'We were very intolerant,' he says. 'We'd take the contents of somebody's handbag or pockets and even tiny grains, if it could be proved that it was cannabis we would prosecute, feeling that we could criminalise it out of the system. Clearly, we didn't. And that doesn't address the issues of attraction to drugs, of people being destroyed by drugs.' He no longer believes that locking people up is the solution. Put an addict through successful treatment, he says, and you stop them committing crimes to finance their habit. Or dealing and creating new users.

      "body": "<p>Perhaps I'm being oversensitive, but sometimes when I extol the virtues of trad British cooking, I feel as if I might as well be suggesting we get together on a National Front march. People are embarrassed: I see that, but frankly I have no desire to be saddled with their embarrassment. In the kitchen, at least, I think it's time we got rid of our post-colonial guilt. The recipes below are all irreproachable in their orthodox state. I haven't fiddled out of a desire to improve or to impose self-conscious modernity, but simply because other, more newly available ingredients naturally offered themselves.</p> <p><b>Whitebait with salsa</b></p> <p>When I was a child, whitebait was the restaurant starter; now it seems to have disappeared. So much is this the case that I feel I need to explain what I'm talking about. Whitebait are small fish, indeed, the original 'small fry', and it's the size rather than the genus that's significant. The cooking is minimal: the fish are dredged in flour, plunged into hot fat and piled on to a pile of deep-fried parsley (the old, curly kind), a squeeze of lemon, and bread and butter.</p> <p>The other day I substituted coriander for parsley (that's what I had in the fridge) and served a spiky, aromatic salsa alongside the fish. It works wonderfully. But using limes in place of lemon, chilli where it used to be cayenne, amplifies rather than alters the balance of the dish. Serves 2 as a main course (or 1, if am that one) or 4 as a starter.</p> <p>Oil for frying (I used about 3 litres vegetable oil) <br> 500g whitebait <br> 100g plain flour <br> salt and pepper for seasoning the flour <br> Maldon salt for sprinkling over</p> <p><b> for the salsa</b></p> <p>3 long red chillies, de-seeded and finely chopped <br> 4 spring onions, halved and finely chopped <br> 12 small vine tomatoes, preferably Vittoria, seeded and chopped <br> juice of 2 limes <br> chopped leaves from 1 bunch of coriander (some of which will be used, above, for deep-frying)<br> salt to taste</p> <p>This is a very quick operation, so get the oil on to heat up before you do anything else. I use my deep-fat fryer (heated to 190 C), but otherwise fill a suitable pan, with a basket, and put it on the hob. Meanwhile, combine all of the salsa ingredients together, and let the flavours develop while you do the fish. Remember to keep some coriander aside.</p> <p>Put the fish and seasoned flour into a freezer bag and toss everything around to coat the fish. Shake off the excess flour by turning it all out into a sieve, then plunge the fish into the hot oil. Cook for about 3 minutes or until they look crispy and tempting.</p> <p>Turn out on to kitchen towel, and while the whitebait is degreasing itself, throw a small handful of coriander into the hot fat to deep-fry. Pile the whitebait on to a plate and sprinkle over some Maldon salt. When the leaves have turned a very dark green, a mere minute or so, fish them out, drain on some kitchen towel and scatter over the whitebait . Put the salsa in a bowl on the table alongside, or else, dollop it on to the whitebait plate.</p> <p><b>Steak and kidney pudding</b></p> <p>You may think, first off, that a steak and kidney pudding made with a thick suet crust is not the sort of food you eat. All I can say is, cook it and you'll change your mind. The ridiculous thing is that one assume that anything made with suet will be dense and stodgy, but in fact it gives an almost ethereal lightness. That's only the case if it's eaten immediately - but eat fast, and you'll be safe by the time you get around to second helpings.</p> <p>I always use vegetable suet, as I don't like eating meat stuff the derivation of which I do not know. While suet crust is easy to make (just stir together flour, suet and water and roll it out; it's naturally pliable), you must make it at the last minute: this is the only pastry that shouldn't be left to rest at all.</p> <p>The stock I use is most often the fresh-tubbed sort made by Joub\u00e8re, otherwise a cube, if it's a good one, is fine, and I might then consider using a mushroom-stock cube, or a few dried mushrooms and their soaking water, instead of a beef one.</p> <p>As for equipment: life is very much easier if you buy a plastic pudding basin with a fitted lid than if you use a traditional basin, but if you are defter than I (not hard), feel free. You don't need to steam the pudding: simply immerse it in a large pan of boiling water. But if you have a steamer, then use it.</p> <p>Traditionally, oysters were added to steak and kidney puddings; I thought a little oyster sauce might be an appropriate contemporary adaptation, and it was. I found some Oyster Stout, which seemed entirely right for it, but it's hardly essential. Serves 6.</p> <p>1 medium onion, chopped <br> 25g butter <br> 2 tbsp olive oil <br> 500g stewing steak cut into 2cm pieces <br> 250g lambs kidney cut into chunks <br> 2 tbsp flour <br> tsp mustard powder <br> 150g flat mushrooms (ie 2 medium-sized) <br> 150ml Oyster Stout, or any other <br> 150ml beef stock <br> 1 scant tbsp oyster sauce</p> <p><b> for the suet crust</b></p> <p>350g SR flour <br> 175g suet <br> tsp mustard powder <br> 3 litre pudding basin with lid, both buttered</p> <p>I cook the meat filling a day or two in advance: this makes the flavours deepen and also makes the whole thing less of a performance.</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 140 /gas mark 1 and season the flour with salt, pepper and mustard powder, and put it into a freezer bag. Put the steak and kidney into the bag, and sealing the end, toss it about to get an even coating of flour. Warm the butter and oil in a casserole and brown the meat (including the kidney) in batches, removing each batch as it's done. Fry the onion in the fat left in the pan over medium to low heat until softened. Peel and slice the mushrooms and fry them briefly in the pan, adding more oil if you need it. Put all the meat back into the casserole and, over a medium heat ,add the stock, stout and oyster sauce. Bring it to the boil, scraping any floury bits off the bottom. Cover with a lid, and cook in the preheated, but barely warm, oven for 1 hours. I cook this in the oven because it's the slow cooking on such a low heat that keeps the meat so meltingly tender. When it's cooked, check the seasoning, and put aside to cool.</p> <p>About 2 to 3 hours before you want to eat, fill a large saucepan with water and bring to the boil. When it starts boiling, begin making the pastry, and not before. Mix flour, salt, suet and mustard powder in a big bowl, then, stirring with a wooden spoon, add enough cold water to make a firm dough. Roll out on a floured surface into a large circle, and cut away a segment from the circle to use as the lid. Ease the circle of pastry into your buttered pudding basin: you should have 3cm of overhang. Spoon the cold filling in, and do not let it come up higher than 2cm below the rim. Roll out the segment into a small circle to fit the top and seal it with the overhanging edges. Now clip on the basin's buttered lid and immerse in water or place in a steamer over water and leave the pudding there for 2 hours, checking water levels occasionally. Turn the pudding out on to a plate with a good lip, or a shallow bowl: there is a wonderful moment when, like a bulldozed building, your pudding crumples then cascades down; you need to make sure every thick, oozy bit of beefy liquid is safely contained.</p> <p><b>Raspberry and lemongrass trifle</b></p> <p>I came across the idea of using lemongrass for Britfood, indeed Britpud, while adapting a recipe for lemon balm and sauternes jelly (which is in How to Eat ). As always with trifles, it isn't entirely helpful to be too precise about quantities: think of layers rather than amounts - the dish you use will influence how much you need of what. Use the following, then, as a guide more than anything else. Serves 8-10.</p> <p>600ml water <br> 325g caster sugar <br> 50g lemongrass (3-4 sticks) halved lengthways <br> 16 trifle sponges (2 packets) <br> 300g raspberries <br> 3-4 tbsp vodka (to taste) <br> 600ml single cream <br> 8 egg yolks <br> 75g caster sugar <br> 500ml double cream</p> <p>Put the water and caster sugar in a saucepan over medium heat and bring to the boil . Once it's bubbling, let the syrup boil for 5 minutes. Take the pan off the heat and add the lemongrass, pressing it first with the flat side of a knife to bruise it, and let it infuse for about 30 minutes. Strain the syrup into a measuring jug, and put the lemongrass back in the saucepan and put it to one side. Take out 200ml of the syrup and put it into a pan with the raspberries. Bring it to a rolling boil and let it thicken slightly, mashing the fruit to make a jamlike consistency. Dunk the trifle sponges in the raspberry mixture and arrange them in the bottom of a glass bowl, pouring over any syrupy raspberries that remain in the pan. Add the vodka and lemongrass syrup, reserving 200-300ml of syrup, depending on how much your sponges absorb. Reserve the rest of the syrup for later.</p> <p>Meanwhile, to make the custard, heat the single cream in the syrup pan with the lemongrass until it is nearly boiling, take it off the heat and let it infuse for 15 minutes or so. Whisk the yolks and sugar and pour the cream (with the lemongrass) into the same bowl, then whisk again and put the custard back on the heat in the washed-out pan. Stir over medium heat until the custard thickens (5-7 minutes), then pour it over the trifle sponges. Leave it to cool; it is best left for 24 hours before the final stage and eating.</p> <p>So, a day later, whip the double cream until thick but not stiff, and cover the custard layer with it. Using the remaining sugar syrup, about 200ml, make a caramel by heating it in a saucepan and letting it boil away until it turns a light gold. Drizzle the sugar syrup over the cream: think Jackson Pollock.</p> <p><b>Ginger biscuits</b> Ginger biscuits are traditional enough, but we've always made them with ground ginger. Now that fresh root ginger is widely available, it seemed to make more sense to use that instead. You don't need to eat these with the syllabub that follows, but they do go immensely well. Makes about 35 biscuits.</p> <p>300g plain flour <br> 1 tsp baking powder <br> 2.5cm length root ginger <br> 125g light muscavado sugar <br> 100g butter <br> 1 egg <br> 75ml golden syrup</p> <p><b> for the icing</b></p> <p>100ml boiling water <br> 1 cm root ginger <br> 200g icing sugar, sieved, or enough to make a not-too-thick but spreadable glaze</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180 C/gas mark 4. Cream the butter and the sugar, and grate in the ginger (I recommend a fine Microplane grater which you can get by mail order from Divertimenti; call 020 7935 0689), as it gives you a juicy pur\u00e9e rather than shreds. Then beat in the flour and baking powder. Measure the golden syrup into a jug, and add the egg, whisking them together. Add this liquid to the mixture to form a dough, but do not overmix. Form it into two balls, wrap in clingfilm and put in the fridge for 20 minutes. Roll out half the dough on a floured surface to about .5cm in thickness and cut out the biscuits, using whatever cutter you like; I use a diamond-shaped cutter about 9.5cm long and 5.5cm wide. Arrange the biscuits on to non-stick or lined baking sheets and cook in the oven for 10-12 minutes, then let them harden for a few minutes on the baking sheet before transferring them to a rack. Use the second half of the dough in the same way.</p> <p>To make the icing, grate the ginger - again using the fine Microplane - into the boiling water and leave to steep for 10 minutes. Strain on to the sieved icing sugar and whisk to form a smooth icing, then ice the cooled biscuits with the back of a spoon.</p> <p><b> Whisky Mac syllabub</b></p> <p>Syllabub, again, is traditional British fare, and Whisky Mac - that is, ginger wine and whisky - is a traditional British drink. All I've done that is unorthodox is to combine the two, adding fresh, grated ginger for peppery oomph. Serves 8.</p> <p>12 tbsp ginger wine <br> 4 tbsp whisky <br> 2cm root ginger <br> 4 tbsp runny honey <br> juice of an orange <br> 600ml double cream</p> <p>Put the ginger wine, whisky, root ginger (grated finely, as above), honey and orange juice into a bowl. Let it macerate for 15 minutes or until you are ready - give or take - to eat the finished syllabub.</p> <p>Strain the liquid through a sieve and add the cream, whisking it all together until it reaches a soft peaked thickness. Spoon into 8 glasses of about 150ml capacity, letting the mixture peak bulkily over the tops, and serve with the ginger biscuits.</p> <p>\u0095 Nigella Lawson's new book, How to be a Domestic Goddess , can be ordered through The Observer CultureShop for \u00a320 (rrp \u00a325) on 0800 3168 171</p>",

People are embarrassed: I see that, but frankly I have no desire to be saddled with their embarrassment. In the kitchen, at least, I think it's time we got rid of our post-colonial guilt. The recipes below are all irreproachable in their orthodox state. I haven't fiddled out of a desire to improve or to impose self-conscious modernity, but simply because other, more newly available ingredients naturally offered themselves. Whitebait with salsa When I was a child, whitebait was the restaurant starter; now it seems to have disappeared. So much is this the case that I feel I need to explain what I'm talking about. Whitebait are small fish, indeed, the original 'small fry', and it's the size rather than the genus that's significant. The cooking is minimal: the fish are dredged in flour, plunged into hot fat and piled on to a pile of deep-fried parsley (the old, curly kind), a squeeze of lemon, and bread and butter. The other day I substituted coriander for parsley (that's what I had in the fridge) and served a spiky, aromatic salsa alongside the fish. It works wonderfully. But using limes in place of lemon, chilli where it used to be cayenne, amplifies rather than alters the balance of the dish. Serves 2 as a main course (or 1, if am that one) or 4 as a starter.

      "body": "<b> THE THAI EMPORIUM</b> <p>For those more used to frequenting Japanese or Chinese supermarkets, a Thai shop will seem reassuringly familiar, though it is easy to wander off on a culinary tangent when confronted with curiosities such as crisp slices of canned toddy palm in syrup, fresh turmeric and medicinal-tasting pennywort drinks. Daydreamers should jot down a list of the ingredients they need. </p> <p>Fresh spices such as galangal (a form of ginger), lime leaves and sweet Thai basil, along with little pots of palm sugar, fish sauce, coconut milk and packets of transparent rice noodles, perfect for laksa - all the ingredients you find you need and haven't got when halfway through a delicious-sounding Thai recipe. Buried in the fridge are unfamiliar long green nut-scented pandanus leaves (also known as screw pine) which are used to infuse scented rice or coconut puddings. Here you will also find freshly made rice noodles and Thai celery. Close by will be fresh wing beans, yard beans and, if you're lucky, green papaya for salads and curries. The latter has to be peeled, seeded and grated before you can use it. You may also find egg-sized yellow aubergine or small white and green aubergines, all begging to be grilled or stuffed and cooked. The fruit section is even better: lumpy kaffir limes and fat rambutans and, in March, peachy-tasting mangosteens. </p> <p>Anyone keen on making their own Thai curry pastes should buy blachan (very pungent, sludge-coloured dried shrimp paste). This is made from rotted sun-dried shrimp and must be cooked in minuscule quantities to prevent it from making your kitchen smell ghastly. I write from experience. Here you will also find coriander roots - far more flavour than the leaves. </p> <p>For guidance, opt for The Taste of Thailand by Vatcharin Bhumichitr (\u00a312.99, Pavillion) or scour second-hand book shops for the excellent but out-of-print Thai Cooking by Jennifer Brennan (Jill Norman &amp; Hobhouse). Alternatively, the American version, The Original Thai Cookbook (with US measurements), is available from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Amazon.com</a>. </p> <p>\u0095 Tawana, 18-20 Chepstow Road, London W2 (020 7221 6316)</p> <p><b> THE JAPANESE EMPORIUM</b> </p> <p>For the best beginner's guide to Japanese food, look no further than Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art by Shizuo Tsuji (\u00a329.99, Kodansha). This brilliant book describes every imaginable ingredient, explains the philosophy behind the cooking and includes lots of recipes. </p> <p>For the next step, the fruit and vegetable section at Oriental City - a Japanese equivalent of Tesco, in north London - will break you in gently, especially as everything is labelled in English. Little packets of lemony flavoured shiso leaves, heavenly in salads, vacuum-packed, conical bamboo shoots and long beige burdock roots are instantly tempting. The burdock should be scrubbed clean (not peeled) and added to stews or grated and tossed with soy sauce, sake and mirin - a form of sweet rice wine used solely for cooking - for a flavoursome accompaniment. </p> <p>Both sake and mirin enhance the taste of fish, poultry and meat, especially when combined with soy sauce, either as a mar- inade or as a sauce. The warming sake is sold in a separate section with beer and plum wine (gorgeous chilled with fresh oranges for pudding). </p> <p>Returning to more mundane foods, the refreshing and delicate Japanese rice vine-gar is well worth buying. You might also like to buy Sansho pepper, seven-spice powder and black sesame seeds. Sansho pepper is ground from the prickly pear pod and has a lovely lemony flavour. Seven-spice powder is like an aromatic version of cayenne pepper and should be sprinkled directly on to grilled foods or fish pt\u00e9s. You can use either as a seasoning when cooking some of the many different forms of dried Japanese noodles such as buckwheat, green tea or udon. </p> <p>Those inclined to experiment should also buy dried bonito flakes and dried kelp to make dashi, an essential stock in Japanese cooking. You can buy this ready-made, but it usually contain MSG. Even miso paste, once only made from fermented soy beans, grain and salt, now contains MSG. The only exception is shiro (white) miso. Luckily, this can be used for both soups and dressings and will live in the fridge for about a year. You will find a wide selection of dried seaweeds, ranging from nutty-flavoured arame to wavy wakame. </p> <p>The design-conscious should indulge in some of the exquisite packaging available. Perhaps a silver-flecked envelope of green tea or a chunky block-printed bag of potato starch. Rice fanatics should, of course, also buy this season's Japanese rice (grown in California). You will have to buy a small sack, but at least they give clear cooking instructions for everyone who doesn't have a rice steamer. Since you will undoubtedly have to drive to Oriental City, you might like to pick up some toothsome glutenous rice and red-bean sweets from the chill cabinet. Reminiscent of chewy pear drops, these are decidedly moreish when you're driving home. </p> <p>\u0095 Oriental City, 399 Edgware Road, London NW9 (020 8201 3819).</p> <p><b> THE CHINESE EMPORIUM</b> </p> <p>The key to shopping successfully in Chinese stores is to maintain your cool. Admittedly this is hard when you're climbing over boxes of pomelos to reach a tempting array of luscious-looking banana leaves or fat bunches of Chinese garlic chives. It is often only after you have enthusiastically filled your basket with muddy-brown water chestnuts, fresh lotus root and green mouli that you realise you don't what to do with them. Not a problem - just buy The Chinese Kitchen by Deh-Ta Hsiung (\u00a319.99, Kyle Cathie). Arranged by ingredient, this tells you everything you might need to know before giving a recipe or two. Fresh lotus root, for example, should be peeled and sliced before being eaten raw, stir-fried or candied (Hsiung also gives a useful listing of Chinese shops in Britain). </p> <p>Having extricated yourself from the boxes of Chinese greens, bypass the stacks of pot noodles and head for the fridges. Here you will find duck and chicken feet - with or without black bean sauce - along with packets of dried squid, dried prawns, fresh white noodles, won-ton wrappers and bean curd. Lurking here, too, are the 1,000-year-old eggs - preserved in wood ash, slaked lime and salt for 40 days. Soak them in water, peel, cut into sections and eat with sesame oil and soy sauce - not that I have tried. </p> <p>Squeamish shoppers may prefer to browse the shelves. There, you may find jade-green tapioca pearls or tinned grass jelly. Small packets of bitter almonds, poisonous if ingested in large quantities, are my temptation, perfect for 19th-century ice cream and pudding recipes. Then there are dried red dates (Chinese jujube) and black fungus (cloud ear) and a weird white fungus that looks like a sponge. Despite the lack of English instructions, the fungus can be washed and soaked before being added for texture to stir-fries, while the dates (according to Hsiung) can be simmered in an Oriental chicken stew. Look out for canned straw mushrooms and salted yellow or black beans. Once open, the beans will live in the fridge for months. Citrus-scented pink Sichuan peppercorns and ground licorice powder and star anise are irresistible. Beware, however, the large black and gold tins of Gourmet Powder. This is the raw form of monosodium glutamate, a pernicious taste enhancer that induces an allergic reaction in some people. </p> <p>In common with all supermarkets, there is an array of nibbles close to the till. Toasted pumpkin seeds, rainbow-coloured sweets and, near the Chinese wines, wind-dried sausages. These should be steamed for eight minutes before being sliced and eaten with rice, presumably while you contemplate what to do with the flattened squid. </p> <p>\u0095 S W Trading, 18-20 Lisle Street, London WC2 (020 7439 8325).</p> <p><b> THE INDIAN EMPORIUM</b> </p> <p>You can, if you are strong, struggle on to the bus with Chinese shopping. Indian shop-fests, however, are another matter. You are going to need a car or an entourage of willing porters. It's not just that everything is irresistibly cheap, it is the fact that even the basics of rice, dhal and chapati flour are heavy - never mind the tempting green mangos begging to be pickled, or the metal tava (griddle pan) for making Indian bread. </p> <p>The majority of Indian cash and carries concentrate on selling such dry goods and household items as stainless-steel spice boxes, huge saucepans for special-occasion curries and all the spices necessary for puja. Fresh produce is usually sold by neighbouring stores. </p> <p>If you're unsure of where to start, trust the crowd and choose the busiest shop. It's like stepping into India, with the smell of joss sticks mixed with mothballs and every conceivable bag-size of pulses, rice, flour and spices: pale green and yellow split toor dhal for light spicy lentils; large oily yellow toovar dhal for a thick, rich dhal; tiny black gram urid beans for Kali dhal, a Punjabi dish made with kidney beans; and beige urid dhal (split and skinned black gram seeds) for spicy deep-fried dumplings soaked in yogurt. For guidance on ingredients, turn to Classic Indian Cookery by Julie Sahni (\u00a320, Grub Street), otherwise turn to Madhur Jaffrey. </p> <p>Flours are equally varied, ranging from gram (chickpea), chapati (wheat) and rice flour to ground millet and sorghum. Within minutes, you will convince yourself that you need the gram flour for pakoras and bhajis and that making chapatis and South Indian rice-flour pancakes is what you've always wanted to do. Perhaps it's the Indian film music. </p> <p>The more you look, the more you find. Packets of fruity tamarind paste (better than the sour Thai variety), jaggary (a flavoursome Indian sugar made from dehydrated sugar cane juice) and fine golden threads of sev. This is a form of vermicelli, which is cooked into a milky pudding and further enriched with almonds or amazingly fresh-tasting green raisins from Afghanistan. A word of warning: before cooking any Indian dried fruit, rice or dhal, check for stones and wash thoroughly. The spice selection is alluring with its retro-looking packets of sour anardana powder, ground from wild pomegranate seeds, and mouth-puckering amchoor powder made from green mangos. There are grains of musky fenugreek and black cardamoms that look like cockroaches when added to rice. Bags of mild dry chillies from Kashmir and small hot chillies from the south for dhal.

      "bodyText": "THE THAI EMPORIUM For those more used to frequenting Japanese or Chinese supermarkets, a Thai shop will seem reassuringly familiar, though it is easy to wander off on a culinary tangent when confronted with curiosities such as crisp slices of canned toddy palm in syrup, fresh turmeric and medicinal-tasting pennywort drinks. Daydreamers should jot down a list of the ingredients they need. Fresh spices such as galangal (a form of ginger), lime leaves and sweet Thai basil, along with little pots of palm sugar, fish sauce, coconut milk and packets of transparent rice noodles, perfect for laksa - all the ingredients you find you need and haven't got when halfway through a delicious-sounding Thai recipe. Buried in the fridge are unfamiliar long green nut-scented pandanus leaves (also known as screw pine) which are used to infuse scented rice or coconut puddings. Here you will also find freshly made rice noodles and Thai celery. Close by will be fresh wing beans, yard beans and, if you're lucky, green papaya for salads and curries. The latter has to be peeled, seeded and grated before you can use it. You may also find egg-sized yellow aubergine or small white and green aubergines, all begging to be grilled or stuffed and cooked. The fruit section is even better: lumpy kaffir limes and fat rambutans and, in March, peachy-tasting mangosteens. Anyone keen on making their own Thai curry pastes should buy blachan (very pungent, sludge-coloured dried shrimp paste). This is made from rotted sun-dried shrimp and must be cooked in minuscule quantities to prevent it from making your kitchen smell ghastly. I write from experience. Here you will also find coriander roots - far more flavour than the leaves. For guidance, opt for The Taste of Thailand by Vatcharin Bhumichitr (\u00a312.99, Pavillion) or scour second-hand book shops for the excellent but out-of-print Thai Cooking by Jennifer Brennan (Jill Norman &amp; Hobhouse). Alternatively, the American version, The Original Thai Cookbook (with US measurements), is available from Amazon.com. \u0095 Tawana, 18-20 Chepstow Road, London W2 (020 7221 6316) THE JAPANESE EMPORIUM For the best beginner's guide to Japanese food, look no further than Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art by Shizuo Tsuji (\u00a329.99, Kodansha). This brilliant book describes every imaginable ingredient, explains the philosophy behind the cooking and includes lots of recipes. For the next step, the fruit and vegetable section at Oriental City - a Japanese equivalent of Tesco, in north London - will break you in gently, especially as everything is labelled in English. Little packets of lemony flavoured shiso leaves, heavenly in salads, vacuum-packed, conical bamboo shoots and long beige burdock roots are instantly tempting. The burdock should be scrubbed clean (not peeled) and added to stews or grated and tossed with soy sauce, sake and mirin - a form of sweet rice wine used solely for cooking - for a flavoursome accompaniment. Both sake and mirin enhance the taste of fish, poultry and meat, especially when combined with soy sauce, either as a mar- inade or as a sauce. The warming sake is sold in a separate section with beer and plum wine (gorgeous chilled with fresh oranges for pudding). Returning to more mundane foods, the refreshing and delicate Japanese rice vine-gar is well worth buying. You might also like to buy Sansho pepper, seven-spice powder and black sesame seeds. Sansho pepper is ground from the prickly pear pod and has a lovely lemony flavour. Seven-spice powder is like an aromatic version of cayenne pepper and should be sprinkled directly on to grilled foods or fish pt\u00e9s. You can use either as a seasoning when cooking some of the many different forms of dried Japanese noodles such as buckwheat, green tea or udon.

      "body": "<p>'You won't find food like this in an Indian restaurant,' Pushpaben Kotecha assures me as she puts two small, deep-fried dumplings on to my plate. They are straight from the pan, golden and crispy, and they smell delicious. They are called kachouri - balls of sweet and spicy crushed lentils with a samosa-like batter around the outside. Pushpaben is deftly shaping them in her hands and frying them for the next hungry guest. She does it without even thinking. </p> <p>Amandip Uppal, Pushpaben's new daughter-in-law, is savouring hers. 'I didn't know about kachouri until I met Jaimin,' she says. They are a Gujarati snack; Amandip's family is Punjabi. She married Jaimin earlier this year, and has been living in the family house in north London, with mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law ever since. Mealtimes like this unite the family, and Amandip and Pushpaben are often to be found in the kitchen late at night, experimenting with some new recipe or idea. 'I don't even attempt to make kachouri yet,' says Amandip. 'Pushpaben has years of experience.' </p> <p>Tonight is a special occasion. It's the beginning of Diwali, the Hindu Festival of Light, and the start of the new year - 2057. The day has been spent cleaning the house, and decorating it with flowers and candles. It's the family's first Diwali with their new temple, or mandir. Until recently, Pushpaben had a shrine in her bedroom. But in the summer, the family had the garage converted into their own place for prayer and meditation. The gods are all there -from Shiva and Krishna, to Laxmi, the goddess of prosperity and wealth to whom this festival is dedicated. The old shrine now forms part of a larger one -there is even space on the altar for a Mother Mary and a face of the Aga Khan. There is always a candle burning in the home-made temple. But during Diwali (which literally translates as 'row of lights'), they are every where, the first thing you see as you enter the house, twinkling away on a little shrine in the doorway. In the middle sits the elephant-headed god Ganesh, and on each side there is a tile which has been decorated with brightly coloured pigment powder. 'In India, you have to step over the shrine as you come inside,' explains Jaimin. For practical reasons, theirs is set to one side so visitors don't burn themselves on their way in. </p> <p>Outside, there are fireworks exploding all around. But in the candle-lit temple, Pushpaben leads the prayers, and the rest of the family - Jaimin, Amandip, Hemal, Situl and his girlfriend Reshma - follow her lead. Pushpaben teaches Jaimin and Amandip how to do the ceremony so that in the future, the tradition will be carried on in the family. Before the gods, they have placed an offering of sweets fresh from the Pradip Sweet Mart in Kenton. </p> <p>After prayers, the sweets will join the rest of the food on the kitchen table, ready for an informal feast. Hopefully, it will be an auspicious year for Amandip, who is launching her own business making Indian canap\u00e9s for events and parties. 'Pushpaben and I talk about food all the time,' she says. 'A lot of girls in my generation resent cooking and resent getting married. There was a time when I would never have worn an Indian outfit like this, and to cook Indian food was like letting the sisters down.' </p> <p>But Amandip, 30, is enjoying marriage and is an avid cook. 'When I first cooked for my mother-in-law, she burst into tears. She said, \"Girls your generation don't cook like this anymore.\"' Yet Amandip learned from her parents as a teenager, growing up on a farm in Yorkshire. She watched how her mother did things, and especially her father, who tended to be more experimental with his cooking. 'I still think we have an unsophisticated attitude towards Indian food in this country,' she says. 'It's all about chicken tikka masala and a pint of beer. But I think attitudes will change.' </p> <p>Recently she catered for a press day at the fashionable London clothes store, Browns of South Molton Street. When asked how many samosas she would be doing, she relished the fact that she wasn't doing samosas at all. Instead, her canap\u00e9s might include spicy sweetcorn and red pepper fritters with a red onion; pomegranate and green mango relish (you can barely say it without your mouth watering); mini spicy roast potatoes, and fenugreek and onion seed biscuits. She is constantly experimenting and adapting flavours and tastes. </p> <p>If she was to make samosas, they might be courtesy of her mother-in-law, and filled with grated carrots and nuts. Pushpaben is enthusiastic, too. 'Her strength is Gujarati food, and mine is Punjabi,' says Amandip. 'We have a meeting ground with vegetarianism. There are certain things she makes that are just perfect as they are. Indian food is not precious.' </p> <p>Tonight's feast is a perfect example. A pan of Indian tea is on the cooker. From the fridge comes a bowl of Mung bean dhal eaten cold alongside another bowl of peas and tomatoes, rice, chapatis, home-made pickles and big, crunchy crisps made from flour and spices. Everybody sits or stands around the table and tucks in, while Pushpaben carries on cooking and adding dishes to the table. </p> <p>For Amandip, a Sikh, this is her first Diwali. 'I wasn't brought up to eat like this. They combine sweet and savoury all together,' she says. 'And we wouldn't have rice - just bread.' But this is the day when sweets are eaten with abandon. As well as the brightly coloured condensed-milk based sweets bought earlier that day, there are the most delicious home-made cubes topped with grated carrot. They are made from carrot, saffron, butter, and lots of sugar - presumably one of Pushpaben's peaks of perfection.

      "bodyText": "'You won't find food like this in an Indian restaurant,' Pushpaben Kotecha assures me as she puts two small, deep-fried dumplings on to my plate. They are straight from the pan, golden and crispy, and they smell delicious. They are called kachouri - balls of sweet and spicy crushed lentils with a samosa-like batter around the outside. Pushpaben is deftly shaping them in her hands and frying them for the next hungry guest. She does it without even thinking. Amandip Uppal, Pushpaben's new daughter-in-law, is savouring hers. 'I didn't know about kachouri until I met Jaimin,' she says. They are a Gujarati snack; Amandip's family is Punjabi. She married Jaimin earlier this year, and has been living in the family house in north London, with mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law ever since. Mealtimes like this unite the family, and Amandip and Pushpaben are often to be found in the kitchen late at night, experimenting with some new recipe or idea. 'I don't even attempt to make kachouri yet,' says Amandip. 'Pushpaben has years of experience.' Tonight is a special occasion. It's the beginning of Diwali, the Hindu Festival of Light, and the start of the new year - 2057. The day has been spent cleaning the house, and decorating it with flowers and candles. It's the family's first Diwali with their new temple, or mandir. Until recently, Pushpaben had a shrine in her bedroom. But in the summer, the family had the garage converted into their own place for prayer and meditation. The gods are all there -from Shiva and Krishna, to Laxmi, the goddess of prosperity and wealth to whom this festival is dedicated. The old shrine now forms part of a larger one -there is even space on the altar for a Mother Mary and a face of the Aga Khan. There is always a candle burning in the home-made temple. But during Diwali (which literally translates as 'row of lights'), they are every where, the first thing you see as you enter the house, twinkling away on a little shrine in the doorway. In the middle sits the elephant-headed god Ganesh, and on each side there is a tile which has been decorated with brightly coloured pigment powder. 'In India, you have to step over the shrine as you come inside,' explains Jaimin. For practical reasons, theirs is set to one side so visitors don't burn themselves on their way in. Outside, there are fireworks exploding all around. But in the candle-lit temple, Pushpaben leads the prayers, and the rest of the family - Jaimin, Amandip, Hemal, Situl and his girlfriend Reshma - follow her lead. Pushpaben teaches Jaimin and Amandip how to do the ceremony so that in the future, the tradition will be carried on in the family. Before the gods, they have placed an offering of sweets fresh from the Pradip Sweet Mart in Kenton. After prayers, the sweets will join the rest of the food on the kitchen table, ready for an informal feast. Hopefully, it will be an auspicious year for Amandip, who is launching her own business making Indian canap\u00e9s for events and parties. 'Pushpaben and I talk about food all the time,' she says. 'A lot of girls in my generation resent cooking and resent getting married. There was a time when I would never have worn an Indian outfit like this, and to cook Indian food was like letting the sisters down.' But Amandip, 30, is enjoying marriage and is an avid cook. 'When I first cooked for my mother-in-law, she burst into tears. She said, \"Girls your generation don't cook like this anymore.\"' Yet Amandip learned from her parents as a teenager, growing up on a farm in Yorkshire. She watched how her mother did things, and especially her father, who tended to be more experimental with his cooking. 'I still think we have an unsophisticated attitude towards Indian food in this country,' she says. 'It's all about chicken tikka masala and a pint of beer. But I think attitudes will change.' Recently she catered for a press day at the fashionable London clothes store, Browns of South Molton Street. When asked how many samosas she would be doing, she relished the fact that she wasn't doing samosas at all. Instead, her canap\u00e9s might include spicy sweetcorn and red pepper fritters with a red onion; pomegranate and green mango relish (you can barely say it without your mouth watering); mini spicy roast potatoes, and fenugreek and onion seed biscuits. She is constantly experimenting and adapting flavours and tastes. If she was to make samosas, they might be courtesy of her mother-in-law, and filled with grated carrots and nuts. Pushpaben is enthusiastic, too. 'Her strength is Gujarati food, and mine is Punjabi,' says Amandip. 'We have a meeting ground with vegetarianism. There are certain things she makes that are just perfect as they are. Indian food is not precious.' Tonight's feast is a perfect example. A pan of Indian tea is on the cooker. From the fridge comes a bowl of Mung bean dhal eaten cold alongside another bowl of peas and tomatoes, rice, chapatis, home-made pickles and big, crunchy crisps made from flour and spices. Everybody sits or stands around the table and tucks in, while Pushpaben carries on cooking and adding dishes to the table. For Amandip, a Sikh, this is her first Diwali. 'I wasn't brought up to eat like this. They combine sweet and savoury all together,' she says. 'And we wouldn't have rice - just bread.' But this is the day when sweets are eaten with abandon. As well as the brightly coloured condensed-milk based sweets bought earlier that day, there are the most delicious home-made cubes topped with grated carrot. They are made from carrot, saffron, butter, and lots of sugar - presumably one of Pushpaben's peaks of perfection. And she's absolutely right: you don't find food like this in a restaurant. \u0095 For information about Amandip Uppal's canap\u00e9s, call 020 8427 9955",

      "body": "<b> Abalone </b> The chic, Oriental answer to cockles and whelks, this millionaire's mollusc is also known as ormer in the Channel Islands. Californians pretend to be fond of it; Japanese will pay anything for it. (Oriental grocers; usually dried or canned.) <p> <b> Akee </b> Caribbean fruit which looks like a peach, but tastes disappointingly of scrambled eggs. (Caribbean grocers.) </p> <p> <b> Ancho chilies </b> The days when 'chilli' was an abbreviation for the student slop 'con carne' are over. In fact, you not only have to be able to spell 'chili' correctly, you have to be able to distinguish between different varieties. Ancho chilies are essential to the famous mole poblano. (Bobby Flay's pure ancho chili powder, \u00a33.85, Harvey Nichols.) </p> <p> <b> Anchovies </b> No matter how tiny, anchovies pack such a punch, it's not surprising they turn up in everything from patum peperum (gentlemen's relish) to pissaladi\u00e8res (onion, anchovy and olive tarts from Nice.) </p> <p> <b> B antam </b> A dwarf chicken, much prettier than regular hens and therefore favoured by armchair farmers. They produce tiny eggs, which are cute, but cost the same as chicken's eggs. (Farm shops/butchers.) </p> <p> <b> Barley </b> Ancient cereal once used extensively for bread-making until leavened bread became common, as it doesn't respond well to the action of yeast. Now in vogue for risotto and other dishes usually reserved for rice, it makes a change, but incompetent cooking leads to a slimy texture. </p> <p> <b> Beans </b> Cheap foodstuff raised to gourmet status by the proliferation of Lebanese cuisine. (Middle Eastern grocers; canned.) </p> <p> <b> Bottarga </b> Like beluga and s\u00e9vruga (caviar), a product made from roe, in this case of the grey mullet. (Food halls.) </p> <p> <b> Buffalo </b> Vague reference to various bovines, including the American bison and the Asian water buffalo, both of which are now raised in the UK. Bison is useful for making the South African speciality, biltong, a chewy dried meat often given to children as a weaning device - but the flesh of almost any game animal can be used, including zebra. Water buffalo are usually used as dairy cattle to produce fresh mozzarella di bufala, though some meat will be available locally. (Biltong, Marcus Fine Foods.) </p> <p> <b> Bulgur wheat </b> Cracked wheat, used for the famous Middle Eastern herb, tomato-and-cucumber salad tabbouleh. </p> <p> <b> Butternut squash </b> Along with kabocha and spaghetti squashes, one of the most widely available cucurbits, and the tastiest. Don't believe everything you read on supermarket cooking-advice labels, however: boiling is for school dinners, roasting is for grown-ups. (Waitrose, \u00a31.69 per kg.) </p> <p> <b> C allaloo </b> Caribbean soup made from all sort of greens which are also commonly referred to as callaloo. Canned versions look like pondweed. (Caribbean grocers.) </p> <p> <b> Cardamom </b> Fragrant seedpod used in the Middle East to turn coffee into heavenly elixir, in Indian desserts and masala chai (spiced tea), and in Scandinavia for baking biscuits, such as kardemuma kekse. </p> <p> <b> Cauliflower </b> Mark Twain said cauliflower was just cabbage with a college education, so who knows what he would have thought of the new red or green (Romanesco) varieties. The latter has intricate spirals on the flower reminiscent of a Buddhist temple, but it still tastes like cauliflower. </p> <p> <b> Cavolo nero </b> Funny how food tastes better in Italian. Cavoli are cabbages, and this one isn't black, it's dark green, with long leaves like rabbit ears. (Waitrose, 99p for 200g.) </p> <p> <b> Clamato </b> Not an Italian condiment, but Mott's cult clam and tomato drink from Canada, which never seems to go out of style. (\u00a31.09, Trustin The Foodfinders.) </p> <p> <b> D hal </b> Simple Indian dish of lentils, split peas or chickpeas (channa dhal) with spices which anyone can make, but which posh people like to buy ready mixed. (Tiger Lily instant dhal mix, \u00a32.25 for 200g, Harvey Nichols.) </p> <p> <b> Dim sum </b> Cantonese hors d'oeuvres served in bamboo baskets for lunch (but never for dinner), nearly always including the westerner's favourite, pork dumplings. </p> <p> <b> Durian </b> Also known as the stinkfruit, and not widely available outside Asian markets probably for this reason. </p> <p> <b> Eel </b> Now so rare due to over-fishing that its price has risen to around \u00a328 per kg, despite the popular contention that they are slimy and horrible. In fact, they are neither, but they are fatty, a quality best countered by smoking. </p> <p> <b> Ewe's milk </b> Enjoying a renaissance after centuries of neglect due to higher yields of milk from dairy cows. (Cows produce 40 litres daily; goats 14; ewes 4.) Containing twice as much protein and more vitamins and minerals than cow's milk, and not known to produce the same allergic reactions, ewe's milk is the authentic ingredient of cheeses such as Wensleydale. </p> <p> <b> Exotic fruits </b> We now expect fresh fruit from any part of the world at any time of the year (though they may not taste as good as they do in their native lands). Newcomers include kiwano (also known as horned cucumber or jelly melon) - a spiky, mottled orange fruit with edible seeds and a jelly-like flesh, and tomatillos - little green Mexican husk tomatoes required for authentic guacamole. </p> <p> <b> Filbert </b> A name often used to refer to the freshly picked version of the cob or hazelnut, which to my mind ought to be left to dry, then roasted and concealed in a chocolate brownie; but the green sort have passionate admirers. </p> <p> <b> Goat </b> Used to be only available in Caribbean grocers. It makes a festive Jamaican curry; uninitiated dinner guests will assume it's lamb. </p> <p> <b> Green tea </b> Contains important antioxidants, perfect with oriental food, and non-alcoholic besides. Yamamotoyama green tea even comes complete with haiku and brown rice - so good for you, it makes you wince (\u00a32.30 for 40g, Harvey Nichols.) </p> <p> <b> Harissa </b> Fiery Moroccan pimento paste well known from couscous and now a popular British store- cupboard ingredient; not to be confused with Harira, the national bean soup served throughout Ramadan. </p> <p> <b> Horchata de chufa </b> An as yet little known but irresistible Spanish drink made from pressed tigernuts, which is milky white and sweet, a little like drinking liquid marzipan. It is served by the ladle in Spanish caf\u00e9s, or can be bought bottled. (P de la Fuente.) </p> <p> <b> I nsects </b> Several bold aficionados have been trying to popularise insects as a food item recently, but they stubbornly show no sign of gaining true gourmet status. Still, ants dipped in chocolate would be a good start. (Harrods.) </p> <p> <b> Jalape\u00f1o </b> Possibly the best known chilies in the world, now trapped in a lovely, golden jalape\u00f1o pepper jelly by Tabasco. (\u00a33.45 for 283g, Harvey Nichols.) <b> Jerusalem artichoke </b> Tasty root with unfortunate social effects. </p> <p> <b> Jujube </b> A fruit often taken to be a date. </p> <p> <b> Kaffir lime leaves </b> Wonderfully scented leaf, a little like lemon grass, used in oriental cooking. <b> Kimch'i </b> Korean fermented cabbage and fish sauce, eaten with almost everything, which smells putrid in the bottle but tastes pleasant on food. (Oriental grocers.) </p> <p> <b> Latke </b> Polish potato cakes also adopted by kosher cuisine. <b> Lavender </b> One of the few flowers we now tolerate as a food flavouring, largely derived from Proven\u00e7al cooking. </p> <p> <b> Lingonberry </b> A Scandinavian berry found mostly as juice. </p> <p> <b> Macadamia </b> After pine kernels, these Australian nuts are the most expensive in the world. (Trustin the Foodfinders.) </p> <p> <b> Manna </b> A honey-like substance that comes, mysteriously, not from Heaven, but through the agency of insects on certain plants. It may be a secretion of the infested leaf, or a secretion of the insects themselves; grateful Kurds often make it into a sort of halva. </p> <p> <b> Mostarda di frutta </b> A curious sweet fruit pickle with mustard available from Italian delis. For an excellent version, try the Chatsworth Farm Shop. </p> <p> <b> Nasturtium </b> Wasted in the garden, though its flowers are jolly; the leaves make good salad and the buds can be pickled, like capers. </p> <p> <b> Ol\u00e9 chimichurri </b> A brand of potent chimichurri salsa made in Ecuador. Consumers might want to mix it with tomatoes and cucumber to avoid the sensation of their throat being ripped out. (\u00a31.99, Sainsbury's.) </p> <p> <b> Panettone </b> It's light, it keeps for ever, it has a heavenly aroma and you can eat it for breakfast; panettone is a Christmas cake for modernists. (\u00a310.95 for 1kg, Harvey Nichols.) </p> <p> <b> Pasteis de nata </b> Swoon inducing, super creamy Portuguese custard tarts. (Lisboa deli.) </p> <p> <b> Pickled lemons </b> You may use only one of these Moroccan/Egyptian condiments once a year, but they look great on the kitchen shelf. (Ryad Halalway deli.) </p> <p> <b> Porcini </b> The prince of wild mushrooms, also known as ceps and pennybuns. Their flavour is strongest when dried; they make such good stock that Knorr has brought out porcini cubes. Though, as the mushroom content is 1 per cent, you might try bricioloni (broken pieces of mushroom) from your local Italian deli, which should be half the price of whole pieces. (Knorr funghi porcini stock cubes, \u00a31.40 for 110g, Harvey Nichols.) </p> <p> <b> Pink fir apple </b> The most spectacular of all the newly revived, gourmet potatoes; pink and knobbly as a mandrake, with a delicate, nutty flavour - but hard to scrub. (Waitrose.) </p> <p> <b> Quince </b> Ancient fruit overtaken by the apple (the golden apple given by Paris to Aphrodite was probably a quince), but now making a comeback, not so much as sweet jelly, but as quince paste to accompany cheese, known as membrillo. (Harvey Nichols, \u00a39.95 per kg; food halls; specialist cheese stores.) </p> <p> <b> Quinoa </b> Andean cereal used to make tortillas etc, which has a high protein value. </p> <p> <b> Rascasse </b> A fish whose venom gives bouillabaisse its special flavour. <b> Robiola 3 latti </b> A much-admired, soft, white Italian cheese which aims to cover all bases with its blend of cow, sheep and goat's milk. (\u00a35.90, Villandry.) </p> <p> <b> Saba </b> Comes from the cooked grape juice of Modena. It's a sweet, thick juice good for desserts, savoury sauces and even cordial. (Fattorie Giacobazzi saba, \u00a32.99 for 375ml, Sainsbury's.) </p> <p> <b> Sardines </b> Apparently being bought by foodies in ever greater numbers, but only in the right tins, of course. (Conn\u00e9table sardines, \u00a31.80, Villandry; Sainbury's.) </p> <p> <b> Seaweed </b> Has largely been a foodstuff of health nuts and sushi junkies in the past, but now Eco-Zone, a UK-based company, is packaging the fruit of the ocean in an way designed to appeal to western sensibilities. Seaweed salads come fresh instead of dried, and seaweed tartare, to spread on toast or over fish, is a tasty mix of seaweeds with olive and walnut oils, gherkins, capers, garlic. (Eco-Zone/Villandry.) </p> <p> <b> Tahini </b> An oily paste made from crushed sesame seeds for use in hummus and other mezze. <b> Tamarind </b> Acidifying agent supplied as a sticky cake made from the pods of the tamarind tree, used in Indian cookery. </p> <p> <b> Tisane </b> Herbal tea, an infusion much adulterated by health food companies and put into bags; but the real thing is much cheaper and better - ask for whole camomile flowers, vervain (lemon verbena leaves), tilleul (lime blossom), etc. </p> <p> <b> Turtle soup </b> Sometimes modern farming techniques do us a favour. Take Real Turtle Soup by John Lusty (as opposed to Mock Turtle Soup, as sung about in Alice in Wonderland ), a lovely broth made with the meat of green turtles raised in California - the return of a Victorian luxury. </p> <p> <b> Udo </b> A Japanese plant used much like parsley by the English, but rarely seen here, having been replaced in bento boxes by the more convenient plastic grass strip. </p> <p> <b> Verjuice </b> More useful than saba, verjuice is another grape juice product, this time used as an acidulant which is milder than lemon juice or red wine vinegar and doesn't kill the flavours of the food. De-glazing a pan in which a sauce is to be made for an intensively reared chicken will, for example, elevate the humble bird to the status of festive fowl. In short, verjuice is said to be the new balsamic, and Aussie chef Maggie Beer's is the best. (Maggie Bare Verjuice, \u00a33.99 for 250ml, Sainsbury's.) </p> <p> <b> Water lilies </b> If you have ever wondered what those curious bulbs are outside Chinese grocers', they are probably water lilies, whose rhizomes, seeds, and stems are all eaten avidly. No need to scoff; after all, enviable waif Audrey Hepburn subsisted on tulip bulbs during the war years in Holland. </p> <p> <b> Wattleseed </b> A rare spice from the wattle tree, which grows in the Australian outback. It tastes of coffee, hazelnuts and vanilla rolled into one and makes a great sauce for ice cream. (\u00a32.69 for 30g, Sainsbury's.) </p> <p> <b> X'cutti </b> Pronounced 'shakuti', this complex blend of spices in a base of coconut paste, based on a Goan recipe, it is an exceptional slop-on curry sauce (or marinade if you have time). One of the best I've ever found in a jar. (Geeta's, \u00a31.99 for 275g, Sainsbury's.) </p> <p> <b> Yabby </b> The sizeable Australian crayfish, whose name is derived from the Aboriginal yapp\u00e9e. <b> Yam </b> Almost any root vegetable you can find in a Caribbean shop, including taro, sweet potatoes, etc. </p> <p> <b> Yogurt </b> Now gone the full loop in the western mind, from plain, to a thousand different fruit flavours, to plain again. It is appreciated for its individual lactic cultures and subtle taste - hence the artisanal return to terracotta pots and glass jars. </p> <p> <b> Za'atar </b> A Middle Eastern spice allegedly based on wild thyme, but in many versions, such as the Al Wadi brand from Beirut, its principle ingredient is oregano, along with roasted sesame seeds, sumac and salt. Sprinkled on flatbreads or labne (strained yogurt). In the jar it smells like dessicated manure. </p> <p> <b> Zampone </b> Italian pork sausage, for which the casing is made by boning out a pig's trotter; zampone means 'great paw'. (\u00a310.95 per kg, Italian delis/salumerias.) </p> <p> <b> Zulu Fire Sauce </b> Finally, a lesson for all of us foodies easily seduced by pretty packaging. This mediocre, yet expensive, chili sauce comes in a corked glass bottle decorated with wire neck rings and tribal beads, 'handmade in Cape Town by the people of South Africa' on the label, not to mention a romantic tale about the origins of the recipe. In fact, Zulu Fire Sauce is one of four such products made and marketed by a company called Jock'n'Doris, in Mamble, UK. (\u00a35.49 for 490ml, Sainsbury's.)</p>",

      "bodyText": "Abalone The chic, Oriental answer to cockles and whelks, this millionaire's mollusc is also known as ormer in the Channel Islands. Californians pretend to be fond of it; Japanese will pay anything for it. (Oriental grocers; usually dried or canned.) Akee Caribbean fruit which looks like a peach, but tastes disappointingly of scrambled eggs. (Caribbean grocers.) Ancho chilies The days when 'chilli' was an abbreviation for the student slop 'con carne' are over. In fact, you not only have to be able to spell 'chili' correctly, you have to be able to distinguish between different varieties. Ancho chilies are essential to the famous mole poblano. (Bobby Flay's pure ancho chili powder, \u00a33.85, Harvey Nichols.) Anchovies No matter how tiny, anchovies pack such a punch, it's not surprising they turn up in everything from patum peperum (gentlemen's relish) to pissaladi\u00e8res (onion, anchovy and olive tarts from Nice.) B antam A dwarf chicken, much prettier than regular hens and therefore favoured by armchair farmers. They produce tiny eggs, which are cute, but cost the same as chicken's eggs. (Farm shops/butchers.) Barley Ancient cereal once used extensively for bread-making until leavened bread became common, as it doesn't respond well to the action of yeast. Now in vogue for risotto and other dishes usually reserved for rice, it makes a change, but incompetent cooking leads to a slimy texture. Beans Cheap foodstuff raised to gourmet status by the proliferation of Lebanese cuisine. (Middle Eastern grocers; canned.) Bottarga Like beluga and s\u00e9vruga (caviar), a product made from roe, in this case of the grey mullet. (Food halls.) Buffalo Vague reference to various bovines, including the American bison and the Asian water buffalo, both of which are now raised in the UK. Bison is useful for making the South African speciality, biltong, a chewy dried meat often given to children as a weaning device - but the flesh of almost any game animal can be used, including zebra. Water buffalo are usually used as dairy cattle to produce fresh mozzarella di bufala, though some meat will be available locally. (Biltong, Marcus Fine Foods.) Bulgur wheat Cracked wheat, used for the famous Middle Eastern herb, tomato-and-cucumber salad tabbouleh. Butternut squash Along with kabocha and spaghetti squashes, one of the most widely available cucurbits, and the tastiest. Don't believe everything you read on supermarket cooking-advice labels, however: boiling is for school dinners, roasting is for grown-ups. (Waitrose, \u00a31.69 per kg.) C allaloo Caribbean soup made from all sort of greens which are also commonly referred to as callaloo. Canned versions look like pondweed. (Caribbean grocers.) Cardamom Fragrant seedpod used in the Middle East to turn coffee into heavenly elixir, in Indian desserts and masala chai (spiced tea), and in Scandinavia for baking biscuits, such as kardemuma kekse. Cauliflower Mark Twain said cauliflower was just cabbage with a college education, so who knows what he would have thought of the new red or green (Romanesco) varieties. The latter has intricate spirals on the flower reminiscent of a Buddhist temple, but it still tastes like cauliflower. Cavolo nero Funny how food tastes better in Italian. Cavoli are cabbages, and this one isn't black, it's dark green, with long leaves like rabbit ears. (Waitrose, 99p for 200g.) Clamato Not an Italian condiment, but Mott's cult clam and tomato drink from Canada, which never seems to go out of style. (\u00a31.09, Trustin The Foodfinders.) D hal Simple Indian dish of lentils, split peas or chickpeas (channa dhal) with spices which anyone can make, but which posh people like to buy ready mixed. (Tiger Lily instant dhal mix, \u00a32.25 for 200g, Harvey Nichols.) Dim sum Cantonese hors d'oeuvres served in bamboo baskets for lunch (but never for dinner), nearly always including the westerner's favourite, pork dumplings. Durian Also known as the stinkfruit, and not widely available outside Asian markets probably for this reason. Eel Now so rare due to over-fishing that its price has risen to around \u00a328 per kg, despite the popular contention that they are slimy and horrible. In fact, they are neither, but they are fatty, a quality best countered by smoking. Ewe's milk Enjoying a renaissance after centuries of neglect due to higher yields of milk from dairy cows. (Cows produce 40 litres daily; goats 14; ewes 4.) Containing twice as much protein and more vitamins and minerals than cow's milk, and not known to produce the same allergic reactions, ewe's milk is the authentic ingredient of cheeses such as Wensleydale. Exotic fruits We now expect fresh fruit from any part of the world at any time of the year (though they may not taste as good as they do in their native lands). Newcomers include kiwano (also known as horned cucumber or jelly melon) - a spiky, mottled orange fruit with edible seeds and a jelly-like flesh, and tomatillos - little green Mexican husk tomatoes required for authentic guacamole. Filbert A name often used to refer to the freshly picked version of the cob or hazelnut, which to my mind ought to be left to dry, then roasted and concealed in a chocolate brownie; but the green sort have passionate admirers. Goat Used to be only available in Caribbean grocers. It makes a festive Jamaican curry; uninitiated dinner guests will assume it's lamb. Green tea Contains important antioxidants, perfect with oriental food, and non-alcoholic besides. Yamamotoyama green tea even comes complete with haiku and brown rice - so good for you, it makes you wince (\u00a32.30 for 40g, Harvey Nichols.) Harissa Fiery Moroccan pimento paste well known from couscous and now a popular British store- cupboard ingredient; not to be confused with Harira, the national bean soup served throughout Ramadan. Horchata de chufa An as yet little known but irresistible Spanish drink made from pressed tigernuts, which is milky white and sweet, a little like drinking liquid marzipan. It is served by the ladle in Spanish caf\u00e9s, or can be bought bottled. (P de la Fuente.) I nsects Several bold aficionados have been trying to popularise insects as a food item recently, but they stubbornly show no sign of gaining true gourmet status. Still, ants dipped in chocolate would be a good start. (Harrods.) Jalape\u00f1o Possibly the best known chilies in the world, now trapped in a lovely, golden jalape\u00f1o pepper jelly by Tabasco. (\u00a33.45 for 283g, Harvey Nichols.) Jerusalem artichoke Tasty root with unfortunate social effects. Jujube A fruit often taken to be a date. Kaffir lime leaves Wonderfully scented leaf, a little like lemon grass, used in oriental cooking. Kimch'i Korean fermented cabbage and fish sauce, eaten with almost everything, which smells putrid in the bottle but tastes pleasant on food. (Oriental grocers.) Latke Polish potato cakes also adopted by kosher cuisine. Lavender One of the few flowers we now tolerate as a food flavouring, largely derived from Proven\u00e7al cooking. Lingonberry A Scandinavian berry found mostly as juice. Macadamia After pine kernels, these Australian nuts are the most expensive in the world. (Trustin the Foodfinders.) Manna A honey-like substance that comes, mysteriously, not from Heaven, but through the agency of insects on certain plants. It may be a secretion of the infested leaf, or a secretion of the insects themselves; grateful Kurds often make it into a sort of halva. Mostarda di frutta A curious sweet fruit pickle with mustard available from Italian delis. For an excellent version, try the Chatsworth Farm Shop. Nasturtium Wasted in the garden, though its flowers are jolly; the leaves make good salad and the buds can be pickled, like capers. Ol\u00e9 chimichurri A brand of potent chimichurri salsa made in Ecuador. Consumers might want to mix it with tomatoes and cucumber to avoid the sensation of their throat being ripped out. (\u00a31.99, Sainsbury's.) Panettone It's light, it keeps for ever, it has a heavenly aroma and you can eat it for breakfast; panettone is a Christmas cake for modernists. (\u00a310.95 for 1kg, Harvey Nichols.) Pasteis de nata Swoon inducing, super creamy Portuguese custard tarts. (Lisboa deli.) Pickled lemons You may use only one of these Moroccan/Egyptian condiments once a year, but they look great on the kitchen shelf. (Ryad Halalway deli.) Porcini The prince of wild mushrooms, also known as ceps and pennybuns. Their flavour is strongest when dried; they make such good stock that Knorr has brought out porcini cubes.

Robiola 3 latti A much-admired, soft, white Italian cheese which aims to cover all bases with its blend of cow, sheep and goat's milk. (\u00a35.90, Villandry.) Saba Comes from the cooked grape juice of Modena. It's a sweet, thick juice good for desserts, savoury sauces and even cordial. (Fattorie Giacobazzi saba, \u00a32.99 for 375ml, Sainsbury's.)

One 73-year-old paid tribute to '65 years of service to this country'. The funeral is on Tuesday. War crime suspect Karadzic's wife votes The wife of Bosnia's war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic cast her ballot in the country's third national election since the end of the Bosnian war five years ago. She refused to say whether she voted for candidates of the Serb Democratic Party, which her husband once led. He remains at large despite the presence of 20,000 international peacekeepers. Protest sparks deaths A memorial service in honour of the Nigerian author Ken Saro-Wiwa, hanged five years ago, ended in a clash in Ogoniland with three people killed and three wounded. Fighting broke out when supporters excluded from the event began an angry protest march. Veterans honoured Five of the last French survivors of the First World War, all aged 103 or 104, attended Armistice Day ceremonies in Paris.

      "bodyText": "UP TO 170 people were killed yesterday when fire engulfed an Austrian funicular train carrying skiers - many of them children - through a three-kilometre Alpine tunnel. Downing Street said last night that it feared that a number of British holidaymakers were among the dead, after Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke to Austria's Chancellor, Wolfgang Schuessel, yesterday by phone. News of possible British fatalities came as Austria declared an official two day period of mourning and announced a criminal investigation into the tragedy. There was speculation that the blaze may have been started by an electrical fault. The inferno, which reached temperatures of more than 1000 C, virtually vaporised the train. Up to 180 people were on board, but the exact death toll was not known last night in Europe's worst Alpine disaster. The funicular was carrying people from the resort of Kaprun, near Salzburg, for a weekend of early season skiing and snowboarding. Many of the young people who died had been travelling to a snowboarding competition. Hospital staff in the town of Zell am See said they had treated up to 18 survivors, including a number who had managed to escape thanks to the heroic efforts of an unidentified man who managed to smash a rear window on the train with a ski pole. The passengers perished when the train transporting them to a glacier skiing area caught fire, trapping them inside the smoke-filled tunnel. Rescue co-ordinators said last night that many of the victims had apparently managed to escape from the compartment, but were quickly overcome by acrid smoke as they tried to flee by running upward on narrow stairs leading out of the tunnel. Manfred Muller, head of cable car technical operations, said those who survived apparently ran the opposite way, thus evading most of the smoke being blown upward by strong drafts pushing through the tunnel. Rescuers say the narrowness and steepness of the tunnel - which is used by tens of thousands of skiers from across Europe, including British holidaymakers - transformed it into a 'giant chimney', sucking in air to fuel the flames. The resulting fire was so intense that when rescuers finally reached the site, only the train's twisted metal base remained. 'Two railway workers came directly from the tunnel and told us all they had found was the metal base of the train,' said state governor Franz Schuasberger. 'Everything else was burnt out. We have to deduce the sad news that none of the passengers survived.' Three skiers who were waiting in a passenger area at the top of the tunnel also died from smoke inhalation. Also among the dead was the cable car attendant in the otherwise empty car returning down the mountain. The tragedy raises serious questions about fire safety in Europe's road and rail tunnels. Last year, 40 people died in an inferno in the Mont Blanc road tunnel between France and Italy that started when a truck caught fire. Again the ferocity of the fire was blamed on the tunnel's ventilation. Yesterday's fire is believed to have started in the front section of the train after one of the cables that pull the train up the mountain snapped, apparently starting the blaze beneath the train. Mueller, the head of technical operations for the underground cable car system, said the car operator was told to open all doors in the five to 10 minutes that elapsed between the sounding of an alarm and the sudden break of radio contact with the cable car attendant. He said he was mystified by how a fire could have started. The funicular had been inspected in September by safety inspectors who gave it a clean bill of health. Salzburg Red Cross commander Gerhard Huber said there were between 150 and 170 victims, of whom half were Austrians. Among those missing were 23 Americans, including two children, from a ski club at the US military's Leighton Barracks in W\u00fcrzburg, Germany. 'The fire engulfed two carriages in the middle of the tunnel,' said Huber. 'It was impossible for rescuers to reach them quickly. This is a truly shocking and horrific disaster.' An unidentified employee of the cable car system spoke of choking 'beastly smoke' that forced him and others to run from their office at the mouth of the tunnel. 'Most of them [the dead] were teenagers,' a clearly shocked state governor Schausberger said. 'Today is a day of mourning.' Austria's president Thomas Klestil also expressed condolences. Kitzsteinhorn glacier has long been a popular ski resort. Located 60 miles south of Salzburg at the end of an Alpine valley, the area serves many day skiers from neighbouring Germany. As the full horror of Austria's worst peacetime disaster emerged, authorities were asking how an allegedly 'fireproof' train had burst into flames. Engineer Klaus Eisenkolb, who has inspected the train in the past, said that it was fitted with safety systems to bring the vehicle to an immediate halt if one of the cables snapped. 'It is not supposed to burn because the materials used are fire-resistant,' he added. But burn it did, releasing poisonous fumes which quickly overcame the trapped skiers as temperatures soared to several hundred degrees. Eyewitness Christian Wakolbinger described how the smoke had even affected people in the mountain station at the top of the railway, which is where three of the fatalities are believed to have occurred. 'The smoke swept up the tunnel so quickly that some people in the Alpine Centre were affected by smoke poisoning,' he said. The tunnel was opened in 1974 with the present train installed in 1994. Austrian chancellor Wolfgang Schussel told Tony Balir last night that he believed that Britons were among the dead. The Foreign Office has issued two hotline numbers for concerned relatives on 0043 654 720 000 and 0043 662 8144 300.",

      "body": "<p>Martin Bell, the former British Olympic skier, spoke yesterday of his fears for former schoolfriends and racing colleagues who may have died in the tragedy.</p> <p>Bell, who spent much of his teenage years and twenties in the Austrian resort of Kaprun, said that the funicular railway may well have been carrying dozens of ski racers and their coaches up to the Kitzsteinhorn glacier for a day of early season training. After years spent in the resort, Bell says he knows many of those working in the Austrian skiing world. 'My first thought when I heard the news was were any of my friends in there?' he told The Observer yesterday.</p> <p>'I am very worried about them. If it was early in the morning there would have been a lot of professional skiers on the train.'</p> <p>Bell said he first took the train in 1976 - only two years after it opened - when training with the Kandahar ski club at the age of 11.</p> <p>'It was the first such lift I had been on and I remember thinking it was amazing. It was all shining and metal and really futuristic,' he said.</p> <p>Bell said that as he got older and saw other similar trains, the Kitzsteinhorn funicular seemed smaller and slower, and he was never worried about its safety. 'I can honestly say that I never thought \"What would happen if the train caught fire?\",' he said.</p> <p>'I remember wondering what would happen if the cable broke but I was never concerned.

      "bodyText": "Martin Bell, the former British Olympic skier, spoke yesterday of his fears for former schoolfriends and racing colleagues who may have died in the tragedy. Bell, who spent much of his teenage years and twenties in the Austrian resort of Kaprun, said that the funicular railway may well have been carrying dozens of ski racers and their coaches up to the Kitzsteinhorn glacier for a day of early season training. After years spent in the resort, Bell says he knows many of those working in the Austrian skiing world. 'My first thought when I heard the news was were any of my friends in there?' he told The Observer yesterday. 'I am very worried about them. If it was early in the morning there would have been a lot of professional skiers on the train.' Bell said he first took the train in 1976 - only two years after it opened - when training with the Kandahar ski club at the age of 11. 'It was the first such lift I had been on and I remember thinking it was amazing. It was all shining and metal and really futuristic,' he said. Bell said that as he got older and saw other similar trains, the Kitzsteinhorn funicular seemed smaller and slower, and he was never worried about its safety. 'I can honestly say that I never thought \"What would happen if the train caught fire?\",' he said. 'I remember wondering what would happen if the cable broke but I was never concerned. When you are training as a racer you have better things to worry about. You just see time on the lift as wasted, like commuting.' Nigel Lloyd, The Observer's skiing correspondent, first took the train 15 years ago. 'It was quite an impressive sight. This was in 1985 and it was the first time I had been on one of these things. 'We filed on and I remember feeling a little apprehensive. It was obviously a wonderful piece of engineering but it was pretty claustrophobic.

It was a wonderful change to get out of the thing. 'We transferred on to the drag and chair lifts and had a great day's skiing. But then, of course, we had to get it back down again.' Lloyd wrote at the time: 'At the end of the day you have to queue and crowd into the standing room-only mountain train to get back down. 'As it is a funicular, you often find yourself standing, unable to shift your position, with one ski boot on one step and the other cramped down about a foot below.'",

As they fought their way through the smoke, they discovered that all that was left of the train was its steel frame.</p> <p>'The whole train has melted,' said one rescue worker. Helicopters flew hundreds of rescue workers from other parts of Austria and Germany to the scene within minutes but it was almost five hours before the fire was finally put out. Fire experts said that the tunnel had functioned like a chimney, making survival almost impossible. By the time paramedics reached the train, the victims had been burnt beyond recognition.</p> <p>Experts were last night investigating the cause of the fire but most agreed that the highly flammable ski clothing worn by the young passengers probably helped the fire to spread as quickly as it did.

'It is not supposed to burn because the materials used are fire-resistant,' he said.</p> <p>The rescue operation was still under way last night with 13 helicopters flying overhead. Police asked motorists to avoid roads in the area to keep them free for ambulances and fire engines.</p> <p>As emergency numbers were set up in Austria and Germany, the 2000 young snowboarders in the area were evacuated and asked to report details of any friends who were missing. Norbert Karlsboeck, mayor of the nearby village of Kaprun, said it remained unclear how many people were on board the train but he feared that at least 170 had died.</p> <p>'It was probably full because it was a beautiful day for skiing,' he said.</p> <p>Yesterday's disaster was the second tragedy to hit Kitzsteinhorn this year.

Just 100 km south-west of Salzburg, the mountain is one of the most popular ski resorts in Austria and attracts visitors all year round.</p> <p>Along with the neighbouring resort of Zell am See, it is billed to travellers as the 'Europa-Sportregion,' 130 km of slopes spread across the Hohe Tauern mountain range.</p> <p>Kaprun's streets are lined by traditional stucco and wood chalet-style houses and hotels, their overhanging roofs iced in winter with a thick layer of snow.</p> <p>The area is also a popular site for weekend skiers from Germany - the region is just a three-hour drive from Munich.</p> <p>Many tourists are drawn to the area, which was made famous by the film The Sound of Music by the prospect of combining a ski holiday with a visit to Mozart's birthplace in Salzburg.

This combination of cable and track, allied with its emergency braking mechanism, has given the cable train an unrivalled reputation for safety.</p> <p>Two new trains were added in 1994, reducing the journey time from the valley to the Alpine centre to just 12 minutes. The resort is used as a training area for Austria's junior national ski team but snowboarders have accounted for an ever greater number of the resort's visitors in recent years.

Last night relatives and friends began to gather below the tunnel's entrance, fearing the worst as emergency crews tried to determine who was dead and who was only unaccounted for. Ashen-faced and crying, friends and relatives waited for word of where their loved ones were. On an Alpine slope in the heart of the Austrian Alps south of Salzburg, or dead inside a cable car demolished by fire as it was being pulled up to the glacier skiing area. Road access to the tunnel was blocked by police, with even friends and relatives unable to get access to the site. Instead, down the valley, in the resort town of Kaprun, they gathered in a sports hall to wait for lists to be produced of where who was: on the slopes; in hotels and hostels - or unaccounted for. 'It became very hot in the tunnel very quickly and a thick fog of smoke appeared,' according to Ulrich Cimolino, an expert in tunnel fires at the Duesseldorf fire service. The two openings of the tunnel created the effect of an oven, raising the temperature inside close to 1000C. Eight German passengers at the back of the carriage used their ski equipment to smash through the rear window and clambered out to safety.

      "body": "<p>The chance of becoming a Lottery millionaire is very slim - one in 14 million - although 1,053 have been created since the first draw, six years ago next weekend. But the sight of ordinary people winning enormous prizes has spurred a large proportion of the population to try every week. </p> <p>Ticket sales for the Saturday Lottery alone over the past six years are more than \u00a324.7 billion, and some 458,798,590 tickets have won prizes for their owners. Camelot, the company running the Lottery, estimates that there are 4 million winning tickets every week. Sixty-five per cent of the UK's adults play the Lottery at least once a month, and the average bet is \u00a33. </p> <p>The Lottery has managed what all other forms of gambling previously failed to achieve - to make gambling acceptable. It has crossed all social and economic barriers - the Daily Mirror speculated that the Queen Mother had bought a ticket, while one jackpot winner was found to be living out of the back of his car. </p> <p>The Lottery initially hit the sales of other gaming and gambling institutions by attracting the money of their regular customers. But although very few of those people gambling for the first time through the Lottery have moved on to other 'harder' forms of gambling, many have been happy to bet on other lotteries and number-based games. Chris Butcher, leisure consultant for market research company Mintel, says: 'People don't view number-based games as hardcore betting; it's seen very much as 'soft' gambling, and some don't regard it as gambling at all.' </p> <p>Betting shops and bingo halls have responded by playing the Lottery at its own game. Graham Sharpe, a spokesman for William Hill says: 'The Lottery made our business scatty for the first year or two, but it gave us a kick up the backside to compete more aggressively. We launched number-based games offering better odds, concentrating on getting three numbers. The payments for lower numbers are better - for three numbers you can win about \u00a3500. It's worked well for us.' </p> <p>Custom &amp; Excise figures show that although taxes levied on the pools have slumped from \u00a3342 million in the year the Lottery was launched to \u00a369.8m in the 1998/99 tax year, taxes generated by most other forms of gambling have increased over the same period. Duty paid on fruit machines has grown from \u00a3106.1m to \u00a3156.5m; bingo duty has increased from \u00a384.4m to \u00a3105m; and general betting duty from off-course bookmakers has increased from \u00a36,563m to \u00a37,109m. </p> <p>Camelot has found that punters are more influenced by the size of the prize on offer, rather than the chances of winning it. Although people have a much better chance of winning the \u00a3250,000 Thunderball jackpot - one in 3,895,584 - only 16 per cent of those questioned by Mintel bought Thunderball tickets in the 12 months to November 1999, compared with 76 per cent taking part in the main Saturday draw. In contrast National Savings anticipated the launch of the Lottery by introducing a monthly \u00a31m Premium Bond prize in April 1994 and the amount spent on bonds has increased from \u00a3831m in the first half of 1995 to \u00a31,485m in the first half of this year. </p> <p>But while bingo halls, betting shops, arcades and the Chancellor are doing nicely from this new enthusiasm, some punters are faring less well. Gamblers' Anonymous reports telephone inquires up 10 per cent year on year since the advent of the Lottery. A spokesman said: 'People's perception of gambling has changed. It's socially acceptable now because it's advertised on TV.' </p> <p><strong>A bet that let's you cut your losses? Spread's the word</strong></p> <p>Spread betting is a relatively new form of gambling for those who are really fanatical about numbers. Spread bets can be made on virtually anything, from the number of goals in a football match to the percentage share of votes for theUS President. They can also be made on any UK share, where the company has a market capitalisation of more than \u00a330m, on any leading stock market index, on interest rates and bonds, exchange rates, commodities and options. For this reason spread betting has been most popular in the City. </p> <p>Spread bets can be made either up or down. Take as an example the number of runs England skipper Nasser Hussein would make in a three-match one-day cricket series against Pakistan. The bookmaker may quote a spread of 80-90 for Hussein's runs. You make an imaginary \u00a31-a-run up-bet from 90, gambling on Hussein enjoying a good series. After the third match ends, Hussein has scored a total of 135 runs. Your profits are \u00a345 (135 minus 90, times \u00a31). However, if Hussein scored just 45 runs, you would lose \u00a335 (80 minus 45, times \u00a31). </p> <p>But spread bets can be much more complicated, with spreads moving during the course of the bet. Angus McCrone, an economics and financial journalist who has recently launched a spread betting information website - Onewaybet.com - says it can also prove a very flexible and exciting way to bet. </p> <p>'Unlike traditional fixed-odds bets, spread bets can be 'closed out' or stopped at any time. This means the gambler can limit his losses, or take his profits while he's ahead. </p> <p>'It's more exciting than traditional betting because you take a view based on your judgment, and if you are very right, you can make a lot more money than if you are a little right.' </p> <p>The biggest win through financial spread betting is reputed to be \u00a35 million, won by one punter betting on the sterling-French franc exchange rate in the late Nineties. However, Mc-Crone warns that losses can be hefty too, although bookmakers tend to close out bets if they think a client is going to be unable to pay the even tual losses. Bookmakers require a deposit upfront. McCrone recommends that only those with several thousand pounds in cash that they can afford to lose try this form of betting. </p> <p>Details of bookmakers specialising in spread betting are provided on McCrone's website at <a href=\"http://www.onewaybet.com\">www.onewaybet.com</a>.</p> <p><strong>Ernie's nice little earner</strong></p> <p>Premium bonds must be the safest way to gamble. The scheme is run by the Government: your stake - the capital you spend on buying bonds - is entered into the prize draw every month and you can withdraw it whenever you want. The only risk you take is that you won't win any prizes, effectively losing out on any returns that you could have earned by investing your money elsewhere. </p> <p>Each bond is worth \u00a31 and the minimum purchase is \u00a3100. The maximum purchase allowed is \u00a320,000. </p> <p>Nearly 700,000 prizes are distributed by Ernie - the Electronic Random Number Indicator Equipment - every month. Most of these are \u00a350 and \u00a3100 payments, but there are also nearly 2,000 payments worth \u00a31,000, 160 of \u00a35,000, about 80 of \u00a310,000, 16 of \u00a350,000, eight of \u00a3100,000 and the jackpot of \u00a31m. Prize payouts are free of tax, and the average yield is 4.25 per cent, equal to 7.07 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer. Bond holders can elect to have small wins - anything up to \u00a31,000 - reinvested in further bonds. </p> <p>As with any prize draw, the odds of winning depend on how many bonds you own. If you have just one bond (as people who have held bonds for many years may), you have a one in 23,721 chance of winning \u00a350. But if your stake is worth \u00a35,000, the odds are reduced to one in 5.3. The odds for the top prize are much longer - one in 712,995 if you have the full \u00a320,000 invested, and one in 14.26 billion if you have just one premium bond. </p> <p>Premium bonds may seem a staid way of gambling - the sort of thing that grandparents buy at Christmas and birthdays when they are short of ideas. But for those who have won big prizes they are anything but dull. Robert, a retired telecoms engineer who won \u00a3100,000 a few months ago, says: 'At first I thought it was one of my ex-colleagues winding me up, then I checked the letter again and found details that no one could possibly know. At this point I was ecstatic.' </p> <p><strong>Backing that winner made me a loser</strong></p> <p>Most people think the occasional bet is quite harmless, and that including their children in family-oriented occasions such as the Grand National and the Lottery is all part of the fun. But it can have devastating consequences. </p> <p>George made his first bet when he was 11, backing the 1969 Grand National winner Highland Wedding: 'I felt wonderful. My horse won while my parents' and sisters' horses hadn't even got around.' </p> <p>The following two years his horses came second and third - and it all seemed harmless and innocent. But by the time George moved to London to go to college, he thought he could be a success at gambling, and his visits to the bookies became more regular. </p> <p>Like many gamblers, he started lying to his family and friends about what he was up to: 'I would nip into the bookies for half an hour on the way home and tell my girlfriend that the trains were held up.' </p> <p>But his problems escalated after he started work as a company accountant. He began to use the company's petty cash to pay for bets, some weeks paying back what he owed, other weeks leaving a deficit. But after one particularly bad day, he ended up owing \u00a33,200 that he could not repay. </p> <p>'I rang up the company on the Saturday to tell them that money was missing. On the Monday when I arrived for work, the police were waiting.' </p> <p>George was lucky: his parents paid his court fine. Even then he had to have one last gambling session. 'I had to cash my giro, and it lasted for all of half an hour,' he says.</p>",

The next trip is likely to be within five years: 'I think the children will benefit from experiencing different cultures but when they become teenagers we would want to come back to the UK or have a base in a big city where there is schooling.' While abroad, they will rent out their house. </p> <p>Their finances have not been so well planned: 'We both had gaps in employment and basic irresponsibility means we do not have many years of pension contributions built up.' Now they are putting that right. </p> <p>Nic has been a member of the Teachers' Pension Scheme for 10 years and Helen has contributed to the University Superannuation Scheme for two. Both make Additional Voluntary Contributions but cannot continue these while abroad. </p> <p>They want to know whether they should buy more life insurance. Nic has a Scottish Amicable endowment policy costing \u00a354 a month which is no longer needed for the mortgage and is thought to be worth about \u00a330,000. For the past five years, they have both paid \u00a320 a month into a Pearl endowment saver plan. They now have a couple of hundred pounds to spare each month: 'We would like to start saving for cars and things.'

' </p> <p><strong>Adviser 1: Carolyn Corless</strong></p> <p>Plans to work abroad mean Helen and Nic's finances must be flexible. To work out how much life insurance they need, they should draw up a budget taking into account where and how they would work if one of them died. Because insurance is required only while the children are financially dependent, they should consider term assurance. Many insurers provide cover for expats, but intentions to work abroad should be disclosed at the outset. </p> <p>As they have no substantial retirement plans, they should obtain forecasts from the DSS (form BR19) to see the state pension they might get. Any shortfall should be made up. </p> <p>Paying AVCs is a sensi ble way of boosting retirement benefits. Stakeholder pensions are open to members of occupational pensions earning less than \u00a330,000. As they include tax-free cash at retirement, unlike AVCs, this may be an attractive alternative for Nic. </p> <p>The endowment policies should be retained as part of their retirement planning.

So people pay no tax until they reach double the normal allowance of \u00a34,385. The extra allowances are discovered only at the end of the tax year, when the unsuspecting person may face a hefty demand for back taxes. Acca is urging those who think they may be affected to look closely at their PAYE codings to ensure they are paying the correct tax. If they are not, they should contact their tax office.

      "body": "<p>Football's top brass say England's national football stadium will be the 'world's greatest venue for the world's most popular sport'. </p> <p>With its futuristic design, and horizon-grabbing illuminated arch, the new Wembley will certainly look spectacular. At \u00a3660 million, it will also be the most expensive sports complex the world has ever seen. But fears are growing that this controversial project could turn into a financial disaster. </p> <p>Parallels with the Millennium Dome are strong. At Greenwich, over-optimistic visitor projections undermined the finances. At Wembley, assumptions about match-day attendances and revenue from corporate hospitality are key to paying back a \u00a3410m bank loan. </p> <p>A growing army of financiers and Football Association personnel now believe that Wembley National Stadium Limited, the wholly owned subsidiary of the FA, will be not be able to make ends meet, leaving the stadium reliant on regular cash injections to keep it afloat. </p> <p>'It may be English football's new home, but it's also football's biggest headache,' said a senior football figure who helped develop the plans. 'People just don't understand why it's costing so much. The price sticks in the throat. Where are they going to get all this money from? And how are they going to make it pay?' </p> <p>So far, omens for the new national stadium have not been good. Costs have rocketed from an initial \u00a3240m, demolition of the old stadium has been delayed by several months and the project is already running a year behind schedule. In addition, there is an ongoing row about whether Wembley could host the Olympic Games if they ever returned to Britain. </p> <p>But it is the combination of rising costs and question marks over meeting loan repayments that is causing most concern. One Wembley insider admitted that some of the figures given by Wembley National Stadium Limited seemed worryingly optimistic. 'I'm amazed WNSL is forecasting profits of up to \u00a370m a year,' he said. </p> <p>One figure nobody disputes is the \u00a330m a year clear profit WNSL will need simply to repay interest on the \u00a3410m it is now trying to borrow in the City. </p> <p>'I see \u00a330m as achievable if everything goes well,' said the Wembley insider. 'But I would have thought \u00a315m, Wembley's current profit, is a more likely guide to how much they will make.' </p> <p>WNSL insists its business plan is 'astonishingly conservative' and says it will 'comfortably' hit its targets. But even financiers doubt whether WNSL's figures add up. </p> <p>'I can't see the venue performing well beyond match days as a corporate hospitality venue,' said a source at one of the banks that Chase Manhattan - Wembley's lead banker - has approached to provide part of the \u00a3410m. </p> <p>He believes that despite the historic appeal of Wembley, its location in an unglamorous, north London suburb with poor transport links may prove to be its Achilles' heel: 'If I was asked to go to a dinner at the new stadium, I wouldn't want to schlep all the way over there. They are being too optimistic about that facet of the business plan.' </p> <p>One reason why Wembley is causing such jitters is the fact that the new stadium is planned to be far more than just a 90,000-seat sports and concert venue. It will also incorporate a 200-bed four-star hotel, an office block, three restaurants, three banqueting/conference halls and a museum. </p> <p>WNSL spokesman Chris Palmer said: 'Yes, income from these additional facilities is integral to our business plan.' </p> <p>Income from non-event days is expected to generate 10 per cent, or up to \u00a37m, of the new Wembley's annual profit. But while London needs more good conference facilities, Wembley's location is far from ideal. In addition, the number of offices already lying empty around Wembley raises questions about whether WNSL's offices will suffer a similar fate. </p> <p>WNSL admits the complex's viability relies on it selling 11,800 top-price seats to corporate clients. This seat category currently provides 10-15 per cent of Wembley's income. It has historically split corporate hospitality revenues with event managers. </p> <p>But WNSL admits that it is expecting to make 50 per cent of its income from this source. Any miscalculations or underperformance in this area will jeopardise Wemb ley's viability. But Palmer says that the 50 per cent target should be easy to hit. </p> <p>'Wembley now has only 1,500 corporate seats, whereas we will have 4,000 hospitality seats, 6,000 premium \"club\" seats and 1,800 seats in boxes. Crucially, we will keep all the income from these seats.' That is expected to work out at an average \u00a3120 per seat per event. </p> <p>But this heavy reliance on football fatcats could prove unwise. Are there enough of them to justify 11,800 top-price seats? And while the FA Cup Final and England games will probably be over-subscribed, how many will fancy the Auto Windscreens Shield Final? An economic downturn, or football's bubble finally bursting, could leave many of these seats looking too expensive. </p> <p>The only place in Britain where anything like the new multi-purpose Wembley has been tried before is the Chelsea Village complex off London's Fulham Road. It is run by Chelsea's pugnacious chairman Ken Bates. Bates is also the driving force behind the new Wembley. But Bates' Chelsea Village model does not inspire confidence. Only three of its 17 boxes on offer to blue chip firms at \u00a31m a season have so far been sold. </p> <p>Other projected revenue streams for WNSL are already petering out. The FA was meant to pay rent to Wembley by moving its HQ to the stadium's offices; it opted for Soho instead. And the hotel, which WNSL has always said was crucial to its overall profitability, may never happen. Hilton Hotels, which has exclusive rights to develop it, looks likely to take the cheaper option of redeveloping its existing Wembley Plaza instead. </p> <p>Government officials now claim the Wembley development has become 'bloated, grandiose and alarmingly costly'. Leeds United recently abandoned plans to build a \u00a365m indoor leisure arena, hosting sports events and concerts, next to its Elland Road ground. </p> <p>If WNSL's predictions do prove misplaced, and it becomes insolvent, WNSL's bankers could end up owning the UK's national stadium - a humiliating prospect. Or the FA may have to bail Wembley out. It has already agreed to provide \u00a3100m in 'contingent support' if needed. </p> <p>Alternatively, the Government may feel obliged to shore up what would be another Dome-sized national embarrassment, probably using Lottery money - as it has in Greenwich. </p> <p><strong> Wembley, London</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Cost</strong> \u00a3660m and rising </p> <p><strong> Funding</strong> \u00a3120m Lottery cash to buy the site; \u00a3410m loan from the City; \u00a3100m fallback funding from the Football Association; \u00a330m share of FA television deal </p> <p><strong> Capacity</strong> 90,000 </p> <p><strong> Features</strong> Hotel, offices, museum, three restaurants and three banqueting/conference halls </p> <p><strong> Events</strong> FA Cup Final, England games, concerts </p> <p><strong> Stade de France, Paris</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Cost</strong> \u00a3260m </p> <p><strong> Funding </strong> 40 per cent from French government and the rest from private consortium which has control until 2025 </p> <p><strong> Capacity </strong> 80,000 </p> <p><strong> Features</strong> Restaurants, shops, conference facilities </p> <p><strong> Events</strong> 1998 World Cup; bidding for 2008 Olympic Games </p> <p><strong> Stadium Australia, Sydney</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> C ost</strong> \u00a3260m but land provided free by the government </p> <p><strong> Funding</strong> Private consortium, which has 30 years to make a profit </p> <p><strong> Capacity</strong> 110,000 </p> <p><strong> Features</strong> Two banqueting halls but no hotel </p> <p><strong> Events</strong> 2000 Olympics </p> <p><strong> Millennium Stadium, Cardiff</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Cost</strong> \u00a3120m </p> <p><strong> Funding</strong> \u00a347m from the Lottery and \u00a373m from the Welsh Rugby Union </p> <p><strong> Capacity </strong> 72,500 </p> <p><strong> Features</strong> 'No hotel or offices, nothing like Wembley,' says spokesman </p> <p><strong> Events</strong> 1999 Rugby World Cup, Wales soccer matches </p> <p><strong>Ground-breaking deal scores for Gunners</strong></p> <p>The cost of Arsenal's 60,000- seater stadium turns out - like Wembley - to be much greater than expected. </p> <p>When plans were unveiled last week, it was reported that the stadium would cost \u00a3100 million.

      "body": "<p>There's a saying in the US: 'What's good for Detroit is good for America.' </p> <p>But William Clay Ford Jr turns that kind of logic on its head. For him, what's good for America, and indeed the planet, is good for Detroit. </p> <p>Ford is an unlikely person to have his feet under the top table of the second-biggest car manufacturer in the world - even if his great-grandfather was Henry, the man who started it all with the Model T. </p> <p>Despite the sharp grey suits, gleaming manicure and soft boyish looks that shout thrusting corporate high-flyer, Ford Motor Company's iconoclastic 43-year-old chairman has more in common with Greenpeace activists than Wall Street analysts. His great-grandfather was a major cog in the industrial revolution, he says; what's needed this century is a 'clean' revolution. </p> <p>'I believe very strongly that corporations could and should be a major force for resolving social and environmental concerns in the twentyfirst century,' he told a Greenpeace conference last month. 'As chairman of one of the world's largest corporations I am in a unique position to be a catalyst for change.' </p> <p>Not your usual mission statement from a car company boss, but Bill Ford is not your usual car company boss. 'There are people who think I'm a Bolshevik, and this is all a major distraction at best and heresy at worst,' he has said. 'But I really don't care. I'm in this for my children [he has four] and my grandchildren. I want them to inherit a legacy they're proud of. I don't want anybody, whether it's my grandchildren or any of our employees' grandchildren, to have to apologise for working for Ford Motor Company. In fact, I want the opposite. I want them to look and say, \"What a difference we made!\".' </p> <p> Fortune magazine said Ford was blazing new ground at the steering wheel of an old-economy company: 'Here comes an entirely new old-economy boss. A nice guy with a politician's keen instinct.' </p> <p>And a nice guy he plainly is.

      "bodyText": "There's a saying in the US: 'What's good for Detroit is good for America.' But William Clay Ford Jr turns that kind of logic on its head. For him, what's good for America, and indeed the planet, is good for Detroit. Ford is an unlikely person to have his feet under the top table of the second-biggest car manufacturer in the world - even if his great-grandfather was Henry, the man who started it all with the Model T. Despite the sharp grey suits, gleaming manicure and soft boyish looks that shout thrusting corporate high-flyer, Ford Motor Company's iconoclastic 43-year-old chairman has more in common with Greenpeace activists than Wall Street analysts. His great-grandfather was a major cog in the industrial revolution, he says; what's needed this century is a 'clean' revolution. 'I believe very strongly that corporations could and should be a major force for resolving social and environmental concerns in the twentyfirst century,' he told a Greenpeace conference last month. 'As chairman of one of the world's largest corporations I am in a unique position to be a catalyst for change.' Not your usual mission statement from a car company boss, but Bill Ford is not your usual car company boss. 'There are people who think I'm a Bolshevik, and this is all a major distraction at best and heresy at worst,' he has said. 'But I really don't care. I'm in this for my children [he has four] and my grandchildren. I want them to inherit a legacy they're proud of. I don't want anybody, whether it's my grandchildren or any of our employees' grandchildren, to have to apologise for working for Ford Motor Company. In fact, I want the opposite. I want them to look and say, \"What a difference we made!\".' Fortune magazine said Ford was blazing new ground at the steering wheel of an old-economy company: 'Here comes an entirely new old-economy boss. A nice guy with a politician's keen instinct.' And a nice guy he plainly is. When news reached the company of a catastrophic explosion at the Rouge factory in Dearborn, Michigan in February 1999, Ford immediately went to the scene, despite strenuous advice not to do so by lieutenants, who warned he could be eaten alive by the media. Without an entourage he visited the injured and dying in hospital until late into the night (six people died), and was on television describing it as the 'worst day of my life'. Three months later Ford ordered an environmental makeover of the plant, which his great-grandfather built, vowing to turn it into the world's first closed-loop car production facility - producing cars whose component parts are so many 'technical nutrients' that will be recy cled one day in new cars. A self-described 'life-long environmentalist' who began fraternising with environmental groups during his student days at Princeton and MIT, Ford has painted the executive suite an electrifying shade of green since he became chairman two years ago. Ford Motor Company has since become the first and only car maker to certify all 140 plants around the world under ISO 14001, the international management standard that audits environmental performance. Bill Ford also courted controversy on Wall Street by pulling his company out of the Global Climate Coalition and lobbying for higher petrol taxes. Last summer he initiated discussions between environmental groups and senior Ford managers.

When Tony Blair visited the Worcestershire town of Bewdley to console its drenched residents, he was setting foot in a place that has not only become renowned for the regular soakings it receives from the River Severn, but one that is likely to become a miserable yardstick for the effects of climate change in Britain. </p> <p>Severn Trent, the water giant responsible for the Midlands and South West region that has taken such a beating, is working with the Meteorological Office to try to predict the effect of future rainfall patterns on floods. </p> <p>Bewdley is central to what it has found - the Severn could break its banks there an average 6.4 times by 2020, compared with 5.5 now. </p> <p>The research indicates that the severe storms currently occuring every five years will soon be hitting us every two. It has also found that the 15-minute cloudbursts that can overcome drainage systems will intensify - from an average 12mm to 19mm of rain now to an average 15mm to 24mm in five years' time. </p> <p>This chimes with Environment Agency research that says storms bad enough to happen once a century will happen once a decade instead. </p> <p>But what is a water company doing researching flooding, a problem the industry has spent the best part of a month saying is not its fault? After all, the problems of the past few weeks - largely caused by rivers invading houses built close to their banks or on flood plains - cannot be blamed on water companies. </p> <p>Nevertheless, companies admit that when sewerage systems become filled to capacity in a flood, a number of difficulties exacerbate the situation. Brian Duckworth, managing director of Severn Trent, says: 'We are seeing massive changes in weather events. We are relying on nineteenth-century systems to deal with new millennium weather conditions. The pipelines are simply not wide enough to deal with these amounts of water.' </p> <p>John Reynolds of the department of civil engineering at Portsmouth University, who has studied the UK sewer system, says there are two distinct problems caused by different types of system. Newer systems, which operate on about 20 per cent of the network, have separate pipes for surface and foul water. Surface water sewers drain into nearby rivers. But when a river rises it covers the overflow outlets, and the river can flow back up the pipes and into the streets. This means that the area hit by flooding is extended along the sewerage network. </p> <p>Older systems combine surface and foul water sewers. These also have emergency overflows into rivers, which can become backed up, pushing sewage back into homes. </p> <p>Some companies have already acted. Anglian Water, for example, had to deal with catastrophic floods in Northampton in 1998. It installed flaps on river overflows to prevent water flooding back into the town - at minimal cost. </p> <p>But such simple solutions are of a different order to the massive renewal and infrastructure work some in the industry are saying will be needed if global warming continues to wreak havoc. </p> <p>Industry experts say there is a need for radical engineering answers. Reynolds says massive tanks could contain sewer overflows. Once floods pass and river levels drop, these tanks could be released into the rivers. </p> <p>Anglian recently spent \u00a320m on a 5-metre wide emergency sewer under Ipswich. Southern Water has a 3km tunnel between Brighton and Hove. Southern, which experiences a lot of flooding, says new infrastructure does work. For example, in Folkestone, a \u00a3120m new pumping station introduced as part of its beach scheme has protected parts of the town from the recent floods. </p> <p>But for such schemes to play an effective part in helping water companies cope with floods, they will have to be far more common. The problem is they are expensive. Which is why the water companies are trying to make their case publicly. </p> <p>They are no strangers to bad publicity - taking the brunt of the fat cat headlines in the Nineties - and are in no mood to be blamed for environmental disasters. </p> <p>This may be what lies behind their enlistment of the riverside dwellers of Bewdley - whose plight, ironically, is probably beyond rescue by improved sewerage - to make their point. </p> <p>The companies will need to recoup investment for better sewers from somewhere - which, they claim, means from customers' bills. That will require the permission of regulator Ofwat, whose attention has been concentrated on ensuring household bills go down, not up. Without such a concession, there is little evidence that the companies will pay for work themselves. </p> <p>Reynolds's work at Portsmouth University shows that the industry spent an average of \u00a3169m a year on maintaining the 301,400 km of sewers in England and Wales from 1991 to 1999 - about an eighth of what is required. </p> <p>Work progressed at 213 km a year - at which rate it will take 1,400 years to replace the network. Interestingly, Reynolds also finds that the state of the network has deteriorated since privatisation while water bills have risen. </p> <p>Barrie Clarke of Water UK, the body representing the water industry, admits: 'We have carried out research which shows that expenditure is not as good as it should be.' </p> <p>Water UK says the regulator has not allowed companies to pass on to their customers as much maintenance spending as they would like for the next five-year period. </p> <p>During last year's review, companies proposed total maintenance and enhancements of \u00a38.3 billion and were allowed \u00a36.4bn. Of the proposed figure \u00a34 .06bn was for sewerage - both below-ground infrastructure and above-ground facilities. Of this, \u00a33.02bn was allowed. For actual underground spending on sewers \u00a3890m was granted of a requested \u00a31.05bn - barely above Reynolds's \u00a3169m a year average. </p> <p>Companies and Ofwat point out that the EU has directed that they must spend most of their maintenance budget on improving drinking water systems and beaches, rather than on upgrading sewers. </p> <p>But Ofwat also wants efficiencies. So while most companies have lists of streets or houses that are regularly flooded by sewage - a problem they have a duty to remedy - Ofwat allowed \u00a3137m for work on 4,500 sites, while companies asked for \u00a3370m to cover 7,200 </p> <p>Duckworth insists flooding is only one half of the problem. Remember that five years ago the problem was drought. Dry summers and wetter winters mean the excess needs to be stored for use during scarcity. And that means a new programme of reservoirs - environmentally contentious and taking years to build - which can also help deal with overflows. </p> <p>Companies indicate that getting the billions needed will be a major priority next time they negotiate with the regulator over prices. But Water UK says last time round the regulator did not consider such schemes. Ofwat says if companies put a case, it will be considered. </p> <p>Opponents of privatisation would say that shareholders have gorged on double-digit dividend growth for a decade and should now stump up. Water companies point to the collapse in water stocks since the last price review, and say the break-up of the industry into mutuals, as is happening in Wales, is a consequence of this. The mutuals, they argue, will never be able to fund the work. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the residents of Bewdley are living upstairs.</p>",

John Reynolds of the department of civil engineering at Portsmouth University, who has studied the UK sewer system, says there are two distinct problems caused by different types of system. Newer systems, which operate on about 20 per cent of the network, have separate pipes for surface and foul water. Surface water sewers drain into nearby rivers. But when a river rises it covers the overflow outlets, and the river can flow back up the pipes and into the streets. This means that the area hit by flooding is extended along the sewerage network. Older systems combine surface and foul water sewers. These also have emergency overflows into rivers, which can become backed up, pushing sewage back into homes. Some companies have already acted. Anglian Water, for example, had to deal with catastrophic floods in Northampton in 1998. It installed flaps on river overflows to prevent water flooding back into the town - at minimal cost. But such simple solutions are of a different order to the massive renewal and infrastructure work some in the industry are saying will be needed if global warming continues to wreak havoc. Industry experts say there is a need for radical engineering answers. Reynolds says massive tanks could contain sewer overflows. Once floods pass and river levels drop, these tanks could be released into the rivers. Anglian recently spent \u00a320m on a 5-metre wide emergency sewer under Ipswich. Southern Water has a 3km tunnel between Brighton and Hove. Southern, which experiences a lot of flooding, says new infrastructure does work. For example, in Folkestone, a \u00a3120m new pumping station introduced as part of its beach scheme has protected parts of the town from the recent floods. But for such schemes to play an effective part in helping water companies cope with floods, they will have to be far more common. The problem is they are expensive. Which is why the water companies are trying to make their case publicly. They are no strangers to bad publicity - taking the brunt of the fat cat headlines in the Nineties - and are in no mood to be blamed for environmental disasters. This may be what lies behind their enlistment of the riverside dwellers of Bewdley - whose plight, ironically, is probably beyond rescue by improved sewerage - to make their point. The companies will need to recoup investment for better sewers from somewhere - which, they claim, means from customers' bills. That will require the permission of regulator Ofwat, whose attention has been concentrated on ensuring household bills go down, not up. Without such a concession, there is little evidence that the companies will pay for work themselves. Reynolds's work at Portsmouth University shows that the industry spent an average of \u00a3169m a year on maintaining the 301,400 km of sewers in England and Wales from 1991 to 1999 - about an eighth of what is required. Work progressed at 213 km a year - at which rate it will take 1,400 years to replace the network. Interestingly, Reynolds also finds that the state of the network has deteriorated since privatisation while water bills have risen. Barrie Clarke of Water UK, the body representing the water industry, admits: 'We have carried out research which shows that expenditure is not as good as it should be.' Water UK says the regulator has not allowed companies to pass on to their customers as much maintenance spending as they would like for the next five-year period. During last year's review, companies proposed total maintenance and enhancements of \u00a38.3 billion and were allowed \u00a36.4bn. Of the proposed figure \u00a34 .06bn was for sewerage - both below-ground infrastructure and above-ground facilities. Of this, \u00a33.02bn was allowed. For actual underground spending on sewers \u00a3890m was granted of a requested \u00a31.05bn - barely above Reynolds's \u00a3169m a year average. Companies and Ofwat point out that the EU has directed that they must spend most of their maintenance budget on improving drinking water systems and beaches, rather than on upgrading sewers. But Ofwat also wants efficiencies. So while most companies have lists of streets or houses that are regularly flooded by sewage - a problem they have a duty to remedy - Ofwat allowed \u00a3137m for work on 4,500 sites, while companies asked for \u00a3370m to cover 7,200 Duckworth insists flooding is only one half of the problem. Remember that five years ago the problem was drought. Dry summers and wetter winters mean the excess needs to be stored for use during scarcity. And that means a new programme of reservoirs - environmentally contentious and taking years to build - which can also help deal with overflows. Companies indicate that getting the billions needed will be a major priority next time they negotiate with the regulator over prices. But Water UK says last time round the regulator did not consider such schemes. Ofwat says if companies put a case, it will be considered. Opponents of privatisation would say that shareholders have gorged on double-digit dividend growth for a decade and should now stump up. Water companies point to the collapse in water stocks since the last price review, and say the break-up of the industry into mutuals, as is happening in Wales, is a consequence of this. The mutuals, they argue, will never be able to fund the work. Meanwhile, the residents of Bewdley are living upstairs.",

If firms are more valuable to someone else than the market, a bid or management buyout will inevitably come. Cash therapy A fortnight ago, Stockwatch emerged from its 'old economy' shell to take a punt on biotech firm Biocompatibles. At 383p then, the shares have done nicely since, closing at 421p on Friday. Buoyed by this success, this week we recommend you take look at PPL Therapeutics, which has recently been awarded a $1.9m US government grant for stem cell research. PPL is a world leader in 'transgenics', producing human proteins in other animals such as pigs. German drugs giant Bayer is partnering its lead compound, AAT, as a possible treatment for emphysema and cystic fibrosis. Under the deal, PPL receives stage payments of up to $25m; Bayer has also taken a $15m equity stake at 215p a share. At 173p, the stock has slipped back of late. However, broker Seymour Pierce, for one, is a strong supporter and reckons the company is 'significantly undervalued'.",

And, unlike with the technology stocks that have managed the same feat, there has been almost no turbulence on the way. </p> <p>Last week's interim results to September go some way to explaining why. Sales rose by 51 per cent to \u00a3217m, and its operating profits all but doubled, to \u00a316.1m.

It is, of course, also benefiting from the explosive growth in the telecoms and data-processing markets, where sales doubled in the six-month period. </p> <p>But even if, as some predict, demand here slows, Volex should still benefit from the continued move to global suppliers - Lucent, for example, is cutting its supplier base from 142 to 30 - of which Volex is one. Many companies still make power cords themselves but Dom-inic Molloy, Volex's chief executive, says the move to outsourcing such products is moving at a 'breathtaking pace'. Nokia, for example, uses outside suppliers for only 10 per cent of its components. </p> <p>As cost pressures on these businesses grow, so the trend to outsourcing should accelerate. In the meantime, Volex continues to win market share in the more traditional areas of its business, such as consumer and electrical, which also enjoyed respectable growth in the first half. </p> <p>The higher volumes pushed margins up from 7.3 to 8.3 per cent, despite continual pressure to cut prices. Molloy believes that can continue, and expects to be able to keep margins at around the current level. </p> <p>The sharp rise in its shares has pushed Volex's rating well ahead of the average for its engineering sector. Based on forecasts of \u00a333.5m profit before tax for the full year, it stands on a rating of about 25 times expected earnings. That sounds high but it is not expensive compared with some of its international rivals and is justified for a company that should be increasing profits by about 20 per cent a year for at least the next couple of years.

      "body": "<p>For many people, Do It Yourself are the three most dreaded words in the English language but, for the City, DIY spells major growth opportunity. </p> <p>While most retailers battle to survive cutthroat competition and falling prices, big DIY businesses are thriving. </p> <p>This year, consumer trends company Mintel forecasts that the UK will spend \u00a310.4 billion on home improvements - up \u00a32.26bn on last year's estimated figure. The increase can be explained by a booming housing market, expansion by retailers into 'soft goods' for the kitchen and bathroom, big profits from garden products and high margins for electrical tools and lawn mowers. </p> <p>Television programmes such as Home Front and Changing Rooms, which regularly attract 11 million viewers, fire the market by persuading an increasingly style- conscious population to feather their nests more adventurously - and more regularly. In addition, analysts say an ageing homeowning population who do not move house often is a recipe for fat DIY profits. </p> <p>As the UK becomes more obsessed with power tools and parquet flooring, the City is driving the creation of big ger DIY operations that can carry larger numbers of products under one roof, yielding increased cost efficiencies through stronger buying power and enabling the giants to compete in a global market. </p> <p>'In 1995, there were seven big DIY retailers,' said Mike Godliman, a director with retail analyst Verdict Research. 'Now there are essentially just three. It's about scale and buying power: this enables them to have the huge stores that attract more customers.' Last September, Wickes, the country's third-largest DIY retailer, was bought by Focus Do It All, with backing from Duke Street Capital, for \u00a3289m. The deal was worth 495p per share. </p> <p>The agreed merger represented a triumph for Wickes' former chief executive, biker Bill Grimsey. Earlier this year Grimsey successfully fought off a hostile bid from Focus worth 430p per share. </p> <p>Duke Street Capital, headed by Edmund Truell, is now poised to buy Great Mills - a trade hardware outfit with 96 stores based mainly in provincial towns - for around \u00a3260m. RMC, the current owner, wants to focus on heavy building materials. </p> <p>If Duke Street completes the deal, it will have invested more than \u00a3544m and at a stroke become the UK's second-biggest DIY operation, overtaking Homebase. </p> <p>Owned by Sainsbury's, Homebase is itself up for sale as part of chief executive Sir Peter Davis's drive to focus the UK's second-largest supermarket on its core food retailing business. </p> <p>But over the past three months, a host of bidders have pulled out of the auction. These include Duke Street; a consortium led by Jim Hodkinson - the man sacked earlier this year by clothing retailer New Look for sexual harassment but credited with building B&amp;Q into the UK's biggest DIY chain; US leveraged buyout group KKR; and French DIY group LeRoy Merlin. </p> <p>LeRoy Merlin wants a joint venture with Sainsbury's, but this would be as unwelcome as peeling wallpaper in the City, which wants Davis to use sale proceeds to invest in its supermarkets. </p> <p>Other bidders have not been prepared to pay more than \u00a3900m for the 297-store business, which during the last financial year generated sales of \u00a31.43bn - up \u00a3130m on last year. Bidders are said to be concerned at the contracts to open 25 large stores over the next four years, at a cost of \u00a3300m. </p> <p>It is understood that Sains bury's adviser, investment bank UBS Warburg, is in negotiations with just one financial buyer prepared to pay more than \u00a31bn. </p> <p>Rumours in the City suggest that buyer is Phildrew Ventures, the London-based venture capital arm of UBS, but this has been roundly denied by Phildrew. Sainsbury's is refusing to confirm or deny the rumours. </p> <p>B&amp;Q, with a 23 per cent market share, is by far the biggest player in the market, and it is also heading for a period of change. Parent company Kingfisher is aiming to split B&amp;Q and Comet early next year from its other companies, which include Superdrug and Woolworths. </p> <p>The move will interest the biggest DIY company in the world, Home Depot of the US. It is the Wal-Mart of DIY: the buying power provided by its 930 stores, which last year generated \u00a325.6bn, allows it to force down suppliers' prices. </p> <p>Despite issuing third- and fourth-quarter profits warnings in the US - brought about by cheaper lumber prices and a slowing of consumer demand - Home Depot is intent on expanding into South America and Europe. </p> <p>'Europe is an area we're definitely looking at,' said Home Depot's Jerry Shields. 'It's a long-term aspiration, and the profit warnings we've issued do not affect our long-term business model.' </p> <p>B&amp;Q would be an ideal fit. The Kingfisher company has modelled itself on Home Depot. B&amp;Q's store opening programme will give it 17 new 150,000 sq ft warehouses by February 2002 - exactly the same size as a standard Home Depot store. By 2003, there will be 430 B&amp;Qs. </p> <p>But the Americans need to wait for the demerger to avoid a messy deal. If they were to make a move prior to demerger they would have to sell on all the other Kingfisher outlets. </p> <p>On the basis that Kingfisher's latest results showed that B&amp;Q achieved total sales of \u00a32.59bn, Home Depot would have to pay close to \u00a33bn for it. Add in Kingfisher's French DIY giant, Castorama, and that figure will have to rise by another billion. </p> <p>But while DIY executives are sealing their consolidation and expansion plans, the next three months are expected to see disappointing sales for the sector. </p> <p>'The housing market and big-ticket consumer demand have dropped off,' said Nick Bubb, influential retail analyst at SG Securities.

      "bodyText": "For many people, Do It Yourself are the three most dreaded words in the English language but, for the City, DIY spells major growth opportunity. While most retailers battle to survive cutthroat competition and falling prices, big DIY businesses are thriving. This year, consumer trends company Mintel forecasts that the UK will spend \u00a310.4 billion on home improvements - up \u00a32.26bn on last year's estimated figure. The increase can be explained by a booming housing market, expansion by retailers into 'soft goods' for the kitchen and bathroom, big profits from garden products and high margins for electrical tools and lawn mowers. Television programmes such as Home Front and Changing Rooms, which regularly attract 11 million viewers, fire the market by persuading an increasingly style- conscious population to feather their nests more adventurously - and more regularly. In addition, analysts say an ageing homeowning population who do not move house often is a recipe for fat DIY profits. As the UK becomes more obsessed with power tools and parquet flooring, the City is driving the creation of big ger DIY operations that can carry larger numbers of products under one roof, yielding increased cost efficiencies through stronger buying power and enabling the giants to compete in a global market. 'In 1995, there were seven big DIY retailers,' said Mike Godliman, a director with retail analyst Verdict Research. 'Now there are essentially just three. It's about scale and buying power: this enables them to have the huge stores that attract more customers.' Last September, Wickes, the country's third-largest DIY retailer, was bought by Focus Do It All, with backing from Duke Street Capital, for \u00a3289m. The deal was worth 495p per share. The agreed merger represented a triumph for Wickes' former chief executive, biker Bill Grimsey. Earlier this year Grimsey successfully fought off a hostile bid from Focus worth 430p per share. Duke Street Capital, headed by Edmund Truell, is now poised to buy Great Mills - a trade hardware outfit with 96 stores based mainly in provincial towns - for around \u00a3260m. RMC, the current owner, wants to focus on heavy building materials. If Duke Street completes the deal, it will have invested more than \u00a3544m and at a stroke become the UK's second-biggest DIY operation, overtaking Homebase. Owned by Sainsbury's, Homebase is itself up for sale as part of chief executive Sir Peter Davis's drive to focus the UK's second-largest supermarket on its core food retailing business. But over the past three months, a host of bidders have pulled out of the auction. These include Duke Street; a consortium led by Jim Hodkinson - the man sacked earlier this year by clothing retailer New Look for sexual harassment but credited with building B&amp;Q into the UK's biggest DIY chain; US leveraged buyout group KKR; and French DIY group LeRoy Merlin. LeRoy Merlin wants a joint venture with Sainsbury's, but this would be as unwelcome as peeling wallpaper in the City, which wants Davis to use sale proceeds to invest in its supermarkets. Other bidders have not been prepared to pay more than \u00a3900m for the 297-store business, which during the last financial year generated sales of \u00a31.43bn - up \u00a3130m on last year. Bidders are said to be concerned at the contracts to open 25 large stores over the next four years, at a cost of \u00a3300m. It is understood that Sains bury's adviser, investment bank UBS Warburg, is in negotiations with just one financial buyer prepared to pay more than \u00a31bn. Rumours in the City suggest that buyer is Phildrew Ventures, the London-based venture capital arm of UBS, but this has been roundly denied by Phildrew. Sainsbury's is refusing to confirm or deny the rumours. B&amp;Q, with a 23 per cent market share, is by far the biggest player in the market, and it is also heading for a period of change. Parent company Kingfisher is aiming to split B&amp;Q and Comet early next year from its other companies, which include Superdrug and Woolworths. The move will interest the biggest DIY company in the world, Home Depot of the US. It is the Wal-Mart of DIY: the buying power provided by its 930 stores, which last year generated \u00a325.6bn, allows it to force down suppliers' prices. Despite issuing third- and fourth-quarter profits warnings in the US - brought about by cheaper lumber prices and a slowing of consumer demand - Home Depot is intent on expanding into South America and Europe. 'Europe is an area we're definitely looking at,' said Home Depot's Jerry Shields. 'It's a long-term aspiration, and the profit warnings we've issued do not affect our long-term business model.' B&amp;Q would be an ideal fit. The Kingfisher company has modelled itself on Home Depot. B&amp;Q's store opening programme will give it 17 new 150,000 sq ft warehouses by February 2002 - exactly the same size as a standard Home Depot store. By 2003, there will be 430 B&amp;Qs. But the Americans need to wait for the demerger to avoid a messy deal. If they were to make a move prior to demerger they would have to sell on all the other Kingfisher outlets. On the basis that Kingfisher's latest results showed that B&amp;Q achieved total sales of \u00a32.59bn, Home Depot would have to pay close to \u00a33bn for it. Add in Kingfisher's French DIY giant, Castorama, and that figure will have to rise by another billion. But while DIY executives are sealing their consolidation and expansion plans, the next three months are expected to see disappointing sales for the sector. 'The housing market and big-ticket consumer demand have dropped off,' said Nick Bubb, influential retail analyst at SG Securities. 'The transport crisis means it's harder to get anywhere, and the weather has clearly dampened outdoor activity.' This is bad news according to one former Wickes board member: 'It couldn't have come at a worse time: B&amp;Q wants to look good ahead of its demerger; Duke Street has spent nearly \u00a3600m on becom ing number two; and Sainsbury's wants to get shot of Homebase. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the market. It's just that this blip may cause a few headaches.' And when you consider that 30 years ago, despite the Black and Decker 'Workmate' and the Dulux dog, DIY retailing scarcely existed, short-term fears should probably be glossed over. Pots and pots of essentials In one year, Homebase, the UK's second-largest DIY retailer, sells: \u0095 About 1.2 million garden chairs - equivalent to 16 Wembley Cup Final crowds \u0095 Enough ceramic tiles to cover 190 football pitches \u0095 Sufficient paint to paint a line 6 inches wide around the world \u0095 Miles of electric cable - enough to go around the Crystal Palace running track 15,000 times In one year, B&amp;Q, the UK's largest DIY retailer, sells: \u0095 Enough laminate flooring to cover 1,000 football pitches. If the laminate sheets were laid end to end, they would cover 25,000 miles \u0095 Last Easter, B&amp;Q sold 100,000 lawnmowers \u0095 In one year, B&amp;Q sells a mountain of toilet seats that if stacked one on top of each other would be three times the height of Ben Nevis \u0095 Enough masking tape to wrap around the world twice \u0095 More than 5 million paving slabs \u0095 Around 2.3 million shelving kits",

Which they clearly haven't. They played a storming set - and they made it look easy. For some of the numbers, Jimi and Andy, a decent vocalist and no mean harmonica player, effortlessly swapped roles and places. </p> <p>The music is a hybrid of mournful (and, in the studio at least, mellow) indie and psychedelia, new-wave rock and pop. Jimi and Andy's vocals sit on a rich bed of guitar and non-yob-rock drumming, betraying the band's roots in the early Nineties house scene. The already full sound was complemented by occasional sequenced beats and atmospheric samples. </p> <p>If anything, the set had more power than the group's self-produced album, an understated affair which taps a bleak vein only Mancunian bands seem able to mine. By the time the mid-set rocker 'Catch the Sun' kicked in, the crowd were jumping in jubilation; one individual even managed a stage-dive. It's not the kind of response I had expected, given set opener 'Firesuite', a loose cousin to the Smiths' 'The Draize Train', and the melancholic 'Break Me Gently'; nor had the band, who said this home-turf gig had been the best on the tour. </p> <p>I was impressed to hear the audience singing along to 'A House', which hints at the night the group's studio (containing all their master tapes) was destroyed by fire in 1995. The crowd stopped short of holding lighters aloft, but only just. </p> <p>After the gig, I talked to the group about their meeting as devotees of house at the Hacienda and their number three chart success as Sub Sub in 1993 with the anthemic 'Ain't No Love [Ain't No Use]'. We talked about the state of the British music scene: 'It's healthy, it's vibrant - there's loads of good bands out there,' argued Jimi. 'Maybe we should be questioning more what's being played over the airwaves,' countered Jez. 'It's all getting a bit one-sided - crap, basically. The charts are shit [Doves' new single, 'The Man Who Told Everything', charted at number 32 last week] but people have been fed it and soon they start to digest it.' </p> <p>Not that Doves disapprove of pop; they insist they're a pop band too, and, as Jimi said: 'There's a place for it - if you're 12 years old. We've all been there, so I can't diss Britney - it's just irrelevant to me.' </p> <p>Irrelevant, too, perhaps, to the 100,000 people who have bought the band's album since its release. Doves' nomination for the Mercury Music Prize alongside fellow thirtysomething Mancunian Badly Drawn Boy - and the latter's triumph at the award ceremony - might seem a good omen for such talent. According to Jimi: 'The record companies are signing bands like us, who are in it for the long haul.' It's just, they say, a question of A&amp;R departments leaving well alone.

Who would take an episode from the career of a drama reviewer and put it on the stage?

Lounging in the heat of Santa Monica. Where was I when I set off to write about Tynan? Crawling through a north of England sodden with lakes of floodwater. </p> <p><strong> Smoking With Lulu</strong> brings to dramatic life the New Yorker profile that Tynan wrote about Brooks 40 years after she'd made her last movie. When they met, Brooks was in her seventies, bedridden with osteoarthritis and emphysema. Tynan was 51, a torrent of opinion, evocation and wordplay; he was also a stammerer: 'You hardly notice it when I write.' He was to die six years later - of emphysema. </p> <p>The play floats on Brooks's wit as well as Tynan's: she dismissed Dietrich as 'that contraption' and wanted to call her autobiography Naked on My Goat (a quote from Goethe's Faust).

Prancing and bouncing wither an audience's capacity to collude in any dream. And no news is broken by this: Tynan's bottom-spanking tendencies, much diarised by the spanker, are less of a surprise than his breast-beating. </p> <p>The play scores as a sketch of what it is to feel glamorous, and threatened. Thelma Barlow, once Mavis in Coronation Street, makes the most unlikely career change since Shirley Temple became an ambassador. She's always enticing and intelligent, but not yet hard-boiled enough for the wilful talent who wanted to be a 'writer's moll'. </p> <p>It's Peter Eyre who provides the crucial moment of the evening when he appears, puffing on a cigarette, glowering down a nose that he seems eerily to have elongated for the occasion, and discoursing fluently, with little breaks for a stammer, on the allure of the burning stick which ends up as ash. Just as you're deciding whether to write this up as brilliance or off as pretentiousness, he pauses, and nods: 'I'm creating... atmosphere.' At its best, that's what Smoking With Lulu supplies. </p> <p>It's been a week of wits and dandies and strange meetings. The National kicked off a round of Oscar Wilde celebrations with a double bill featuring the playwright before and after his downfall. First, Corin Redgrave presents Wilde the fastidious aesthete - grey suit, languorous speech, neck arched like a cat's - in <strong> In Extremis</strong>, a short, two-hander by Neil Bartlett. Then, in <strong> De Profundis</strong>, he becomes the prisoner and lover, passionate in a crumpled brown uniform, delivering a shortened version of the rollercoaster love-letter Wilde wrote to Lord Alfred Douglas from Reading jail. </p> <p>The occasion has an Edwardian flavour: sedate and melancholy, with a reproving biographical arc. Redgrave's performance in De Profundis , by turns Bosie-blaming and self-condemning, is impressive, though his Irish cadences see-saw repetitively. But the production has a whiff of recitation. Tasteful evocative touches - a distant clanging of metal doors, a picture of sky and clouds dangling over the bare stage (the 'tent of blue' described by Wilde) - give an air not of claustrophobic terror but of artfulness. </p> <p>Bartlett's In Extremis is an intriguing sliver, a reconstruction of a meeting between Wilde and a palm-reader he described as 'the Sybil of Mortimer Street... whom mortals term Mrs Robinson'. Wilde consults Mrs R, a nicely canny Sheila Hancock, shortly before he's due to stand trial, when friends are urging him to leave the country. She provides a carefully catch-all prediction; he interprets this as a promise that things will go well. </p> <p>All this is plausible; some of it took place. There was such a meeting, and Wilde was cheered, though puzzled, by what he heard: 'Why did the Sybil say fair things?' he asked Ada Leverson, whom he called his 'Sphinx'. Well, presumably it was, as Bartlett suggests, more than her job was worth to do otherwise. More interesting questions are provoked, but not tackled. Was Wilde's belief in palmistry tinged with irony? And why was he compelled to think of women as riddling oracles? </p> <p>The great wave of Irish talent that has hit the London stage since Wilde has been largely Catholic, rural and funny-lyrical. But there's an odd man out. Gary Mitchell is Protestant, urban and casts his plays in the form of thrillers. He's not so much a phrase-maker as a trail-blazer. His plays are set alight by their urgency. You sometimes see the bones sticking through the plot, but you always feel the dramatist racing to map another new area of the territory he's made his own. </p> <p>In the case of <strong> The Force of Change</strong>, which galvanised the Royal Court Upstairs in the spring, this area is the RUC under pressure: pressure from the peace process and pressure from UDA sympathisers; pressure to reform, and pressure not to cave in. </p> <p>Three officers - one a woman, one corrupt, one (the superb Stuart Graham) harsh and effective - interrogate two suspects, and each other, to explosive effect. In Simon Higlett's original design, the play was staged in a long strip, with the actors pacing like laboratory animals in a cage; the audience, banked on either side, were the walls of the trap. </p> <p>This sensation is lost in the larger, less malleable space of the Theatre Downstairs: at preview, the voltage dropped slightly. But, under Robert Delamere's direction, the prickly complications of the constabulary's psychology are still forcefully projected. And this makes The Force of Change a minor revelation.</p>",

Thelma Barlow, once Mavis in Coronation Street, makes the most unlikely career change since Shirley Temple became an ambassador. She's always enticing and intelligent, but not yet hard-boiled enough for the wilful talent who wanted to be a 'writer's moll'. It's Peter Eyre who provides the crucial moment of the evening when he appears, puffing on a cigarette, glowering down a nose that he seems eerily to have elongated for the occasion, and discoursing fluently, with little breaks for a stammer, on the allure of the burning stick which ends up as ash. Just as you're deciding whether to write this up as brilliance or off as pretentiousness, he pauses, and nods: 'I'm creating... atmosphere.' At its best, that's what Smoking With Lulu supplies. It's been a week of wits and dandies and strange meetings. The National kicked off a round of Oscar Wilde celebrations with a double bill featuring the playwright before and after his downfall. First, Corin Redgrave presents Wilde the fastidious aesthete - grey suit, languorous speech, neck arched like a cat's - in In Extremis, a short, two-hander by Neil Bartlett. Then, in De Profundis, he becomes the prisoner and lover, passionate in a crumpled brown uniform, delivering a shortened version of the rollercoaster love-letter Wilde wrote to Lord Alfred Douglas from Reading jail. The occasion has an Edwardian flavour: sedate and melancholy, with a reproving biographical arc. Redgrave's performance in De Profundis , by turns Bosie-blaming and self-condemning, is impressive, though his Irish cadences see-saw repetitively. But the production has a whiff of recitation. Tasteful evocative touches - a distant clanging of metal doors, a picture of sky and clouds dangling over the bare stage (the 'tent of blue' described by Wilde) - give an air not of claustrophobic terror but of artfulness. Bartlett's In Extremis is an intriguing sliver, a reconstruction of a meeting between Wilde and a palm-reader he described as 'the Sybil of Mortimer Street... whom mortals term Mrs Robinson'. Wilde consults Mrs R, a nicely canny Sheila Hancock, shortly before he's due to stand trial, when friends are urging him to leave the country. She provides a carefully catch-all prediction; he interprets this as a promise that things will go well. All this is plausible; some of it took place. There was such a meeting, and Wilde was cheered, though puzzled, by what he heard: 'Why did the Sybil say fair things?' he asked Ada Leverson, whom he called his 'Sphinx'. Well, presumably it was, as Bartlett suggests, more than her job was worth to do otherwise. More interesting questions are provoked, but not tackled. Was Wilde's belief in palmistry tinged with irony? And why was he compelled to think of women as riddling oracles? The great wave of Irish talent that has hit the London stage since Wilde has been largely Catholic, rural and funny-lyrical. But there's an odd man out. Gary Mitchell is Protestant, urban and casts his plays in the form of thrillers. He's not so much a phrase-maker as a trail-blazer. His plays are set alight by their urgency. You sometimes see the bones sticking through the plot, but you always feel the dramatist racing to map another new area of the territory he's made his own. In the case of The Force of Change, which galvanised the Royal Court Upstairs in the spring, this area is the RUC under pressure: pressure from the peace process and pressure from UDA sympathisers; pressure to reform, and pressure not to cave in. Three officers - one a woman, one corrupt, one (the superb Stuart Graham) harsh and effective - interrogate two suspects, and each other, to explosive effect. In Simon Higlett's original design, the play was staged in a long strip, with the actors pacing like laboratory animals in a cage; the audience, banked on either side, were the walls of the trap. This sensation is lost in the larger, less malleable space of the Theatre Downstairs: at preview, the voltage dropped slightly. But, under Robert Delamere's direction, the prickly complications of the constabulary's psychology are still forcefully projected. And this makes The Force of Change a minor revelation.",

      "body": "<p><strong> William Blake</strong><br>Tate Britain, London SW1 until 11 February </p> <p> William Blake has been seen - in our time, if not his - as the patron saint of outsiders: an idealist working in complete defiance of establishment tastes who would rather cut off his hand than accept tainted money. He is born in Soho, refuses to go to church or school and never leaves the inner city except for a single trip during which he is charged with sedition. </p> <p>An autodidact, trained only as a hack engraver, he develops the most original fusion of word and image in the history of art. Yet nobody comes to his first and last show - at the age of 53 - and his reputation is mainly for madness. Critics deride him as a lunatic, libertarian and nudist. Even fans like Wordsworth pity his afflicted visions, launching the myth of the Cockney nutcase. </p> <p>The visions, of course, are amazing. Saints diving through the firmament, devils skating on water, angels backcrawling through seas of gossamer cloud. Blake imagined insects reincarnated as titans, tulips making love, Newton doing his maths at the bottom of the ink-blue ocean. </p> <p>In his cosmos, the Queen of Heaven might hold an admiring mirror to her face and God might turn out a tyrant, wrenching Adam like a weed from the earth. To say that Blake turned the world upside down is no more than an understatement. That he persisted for more than 50 years, with no bosses and very few patrons, buried at 69 in an unknown grave: this is the crux of his heroism. </p> <p>Tate Britain does not attempt to dislodge this popular image. How could it? With over 500 works, its Blake show is the largest ever mounted and the biggest event ever held at the Tate. </p> <p>The sheer scale of Blake's reputation will make it almost impossible to get up close to the paintings - often no bigger than playing cards - and the punishing \u00a38 entry fee means that most people won't be able to go twice. But these paper dreams are so fragile that there may never be another chance to see Blake at full stretch - and to see him anew as an artist. </p> <p>Everything familiar is here: God in his chariot of fire, the Ancient of Days with his compasses, the Tyger, Newton, Jerusalem, the Songs of Innocence and Experience. There are the streaming bodies - words made flesh - the long hair, loose robes, rainbows and stars that made Blake such a hit with the hippies. But right away things start to look a little different. It's not just that Newton turns out to be fully as large as the Athena poster he became in the Seventies; nor that the Tyger, beneath Blake's burning words, is the size of a postage stamp. Two items in the very first room should scupper for good the clich\u00e9 of Blake as a sky-gazing dreamer forever tripping over the curb. </p> <p>The first is a tiny engraving from 1820, made around the time of his disastrous show. It's a drawing of an ancient sculpture: Laocoon and his sons tangled in a knot of serpents. Blake has tendentiously renamed the figures Jehovah, Adam and Satan. More than that, he has imprisoned them in a dense graffiti of slogans - 'Christianity is art: money its curse', 'Science is the tree of death' and so forth. </p> <p>It's a full-scale rant, put there to remind you that Blake could be a denunciatory scourge. The text seems religious, but is planted with anti-enlightenment gibes against Newton and Locke, sly stabs at Joshua Reynolds, president of the RA, whose death Blake applauded in gleeful verse. Proud, sardonic, spiky, Blake held record grudges and regarded himself as the equal of Raphael and D\u00fcrer. Look at his illustrations to The Divine Comedy and you see Dante reproved, time and again. </p> <p>The figures in those great watercolours are dressed appropriately in medieval robes, but the same garb looks shockingly anachro nistic when Blake is imagining revolutionary America or France. That's why the other object in that first room - a replica of Queen Eleanor's tomb in Westminster Abbey - is crucial. Blake made it the origin of his faux-Gothic figures with their hieratic faces, super-long bodies and drapes. He is a radical antiquarian, ransacking the past for the spirit of a better future. Skip a century and you see the same ambition in the Statue of Liberty. </p> <p>Liberty, with her spiked diadem and triumphant arms, would be the woman for Blake if she wasn't so massy. His bodies are lithe, liable to levitate or fly. To see so many together is to realise just how far Blake departs from reality: prehensile toes, supernatural limbs, fingers that touch distant planets. Shape-shifters who can look like wraiths, sky-divers, even Spiderman, their every tendon is revealed beneath transparent robes and skin. The look is strenuous, never Romantically effete; yet each figure is airy, a figment of outline and wash that lives in the page.</p> <p>Blake pioneered a printing technique - relief etching, in which everything but his images and words (written backwards) was corroded from the plate. Even this was a dig at Locke, whose concept of the mind as a tabula rasa waiting to be inscribed like a conventional engraving, disgusted Blake, who believed in innate ideas. The texts are handwritten, the images hand-touched so that they look more like watercolours. Blake freed his art from the tyranny of printers and typeface. </p> <p>No matter where they're set - 1,000 leagues beneath the sea or outer space - his scenes are all choreographed in terms of the illuminated page. The figures merge with the words, sometimes passing over them in fireballs or spiral gusts. Pose is personality. Apollo performs an arabesque, Satan an Egyptian schmooze; Death takes a bow, arms imperiously outstretched. Blake can be corny: David delivered from the waves is like some Cecil B. DeMille finale. He can also be comic, tipping the damned into a tank of winking fish. </p> <p>But you always know what's happening in these extreme, dynamic ballets. Or do you? Take Newton. Does anyone now interpret this superb figure, hunched over his sums, as a massive attack on Sir Isaac and all his works? Or recognise the Ancient of Days, with his wind-blown beard and lightning dividers, as Urizen, Blake's satirical personification of Reason? The later poems, with their druidical, Swedenborgian, occultist mythology, are as incomprehensible now as they probably ever were. </p> <p>Tate Britain's attempts at interpretation are brave, but futile. Blake wasn't interested anyway: 'That which can be made explicit to the idiot is not worth my care.' The more obscure his texts, as this marvellous show reveals, the stronger the images - Urizen adrift, his beard floating across the waters; Albion rising in a blaze of glory; Jerusalem and Albion conceived as lovers, their twined embrace one of the supreme images of sexual love in art. 'The eye,' as Blake said, 'sees more than the heart knows.' </p> <p>Apart from the occasional Regency curl and sideburn, these figures are timeless, their context eternal. To see them is to be taken out of yourself, removed to a fearless, liberated world. </p> <p>If Blake was no more than official stenographer to the saints, as he mischievously claimed, then his best self-portrait is the late Recording Angel, pen in hand and seated, visions sparking above his head in a halo of stars. </p> <p><strong>What to focus on if you've only got an hour to spare</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Nebuchadnezzar </strong> (1795) King Nebuchadnezzar, architect of Babylon, is a warning to the proud: 'those that walk in pride, the Lord can abase.' Blake's king crawls like a beast on the earth, beard trailing, toes turning to talons, naked skin like matted hide. </p> <p><strong> Newton</strong> (1805) Newton, a naked muscleman bent over his diagram, is so deeply absorbed that he doesn't notice the wonders of the coral-reefed ocean in which he is plunged. One of the 12 so-called large prints. </p> <p><strong> The Ghost of a Flea</strong> (1819) The flea is reincarnated as a creepy titan, holding the bowl in which he collects blood. Supposedly a vision transcribed for Blake's friend, the astrologer John Varley; possibly a tease at the credulous Varley. </p> <p><strong> The Tyger</strong> (1794) The poem from Songs of Innocence and Experience, famous as Wordsworth's 'Daffodils', with the big cat painted in fearful miniature below: religion, revolution and animal grandeur. </p> <p><strong> Jerusalem</strong> (1821) Not the national football anthem, later given that title, but the long poem in 100 magnificent plates. See especially the last, in which Jerusalem and Albion are united in erotic love within the petals of a lily. </p> <p><strong> Oh! Flames of Furious Desires</strong> (1796) From the First Book of Urizen, one of Blake's made-up mythologies. Incredibly tensile drawing of a figure leaping like Nijinsky through a veil of fire. Bear in mind Blake's belief that 'All is not sinful that Satan calls so'. </p> <p><strong> Capaneus the Blasphemer </strong> (1824) From Blake's illustrations to Dante's Divine Comedy. Capaneus, nude but still coiffed like a Regency dandy, reclines in the third circle of hell. His face is lit from beneath by flames, lightning strikes at his molten body. </p> <p><strong> The Ancient of Days</strong> (1824) The divine, reaching down from his burning disc, to measure the earth below with his lightning-bright dividers. Despite the force, and the white, windswept beard, this is not God but Blake's Urizen, the despised personification of Reason and Science.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 smooths his luxuriant Asterix moustache, lights his rustic pipe and walks up to the TV cameras. He looks like a peasant, but he talks like a well-briefed government Minister. The rest of France may be in a panic about mad cow disease, but he at least is calm, convincing, coolly analytical.</p> <p>The real problem, he says, is this: Between 1993 and 1996, unscrupulous people in France illegally imported diseased animal feed from Britain. That's why France has a BSE problem. More than 14,000 tonnes of feed was smuggled into the country and entered the alimentary chain, poisoning France's livestock and threatening the health of her people. All this despite the fact that British meat and bone meal was banned in France as long ago as August 1989.</p> <p>So it's all Britain's fault? Bov\u00e9 glances at me dismissively. 'Not at all. It goes far beyond apportioning blame to the British. It was an aberrant system, and those who are responsible for it should be brought to book. That's happening in Britain, but in France no one has been brought to account yet.'</p> <p>The leader of the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Paysanne, a militant French anti-globalisation group that represents the interests of many of France's more environmentally-conscious small farmers, is standing outside the opulent Justice Ministry in the Place Vend\u00f4me in Paris. He and some colleagues have just been in to see the Justice Minister Marylise Lebranchu and her officials to protest against government and judicial inaction over the scandal of illegally imported feed.</p> <p>He didn't have an appointment, but that didn't matter: when Bov\u00e9 arrives unannounced at the heart of French government these days, diaries are juggled, apologetic phone calls made and a scruffily dressed small man with a big dossier is ushered briskly into the corridors of power.</p> <p>The French press has called him the Robin Hood of peasants, fighting against multinational agro-industry Sheriffs of Nottingham, but the laborious comparison is bogus: there is nothing like Jose Bov\u00e9 in Britain, and there never has been.</p> <p>Rather, he is an utterly French symbol who has appropriated the facial hair of the country's most famous ancient Gaul and the bucolic manner of a true Gallic peasant. He's been hailed by the National Front and the Gaullists, the Socialists and the Greens. He has managed to achieve this remarkable appeal not only because of his ability to develop a critique of globalisation, but because his image and his lifestyle evoke a nostalgic vision of rural France. His is a France of wonderful cheeses, thumping great red wines and starry skies seen from rolling fields. All this, plus the fact that he vandalised a McDonald's burger joint - that icon of soulless Anglo-Saxon grub and destructive farming methods - has made him a French hero.</p> <p>The son of two university researchers, Bov\u00e9 was a child of May 1968 - left-wing, hairy, and committed to overthrowing the capitalist order. But even when he and his future wife, Alice, dropped out of Bordeaux university after the student riots, he was, as he recalls now, 'more Gandhi than Guevara'. Appropriately, in 1972 he refused to do military service and holed up at the farm of a market gardener in the Gironde.</p> <p>By now a member of the radical back-to-the-land movement, Bov\u00e9 went to the beautifully rugged Larzac plateau in the South-West of France to join a fight against the extension of a military camp. 'The peasants of the plateau had decided to install young farmers around the perimeter,' he remembers. 'And I became one of them.' In this way, they hoped to stop a firing range being built.</p> <p>Bov\u00e9, then, put himself on the front line against the military-industrial complex. There was no road to his house, no electricity, no water. There was, however, a baby to look after. But he knew he had found his spiritual home, and there he settled to raise sheep and make Roquefort cheese from their milk. 'When I arrived at the Larzac, I immediately sensed a coherence between the place and my aspirations. I had seen too many extreme left-wing militants blow a gasket. But at the Larzac I have something concrete. I'm not a bird on a branch, I am in the real world.'</p> <p>Bov\u00e9 is a great champion of community spirit in an age of individualism. 'The opposition to the military camp created an extraordinary solidarity. Zapata, Cesar Chavez or even the Chouans [the Breton peasants who fought against the French Revolution] - the struggles of the peasants throughout history and throughout the world have always been a collective adventure.' That adventure put him at the forefront of every left-wing militant battle in France for 30 years, from nuclear tests to highway extensions.</p> <p>But he became internationally known last year when he was imprisoned for leading a commando raid on a McDonald's under construction in the town of Millau, not far from his farm. The United States government, incensed that Europe had banned its hormone-injected beef, had slapped huge duties on French food imports - including Roquefort, such as that made by Bov\u00e9.

For the cheesemakers, goat farmers, fruit growers and poultry raisers of rural South-West France, McDonald's exemplified the grim march of globalisation. Bov\u00e9 was jailed, but hundreds of well-wishers from around France paid his \u00a310,500 bail.</p> <p>'For 20 years now, we've been fighting for a peasant, non-polluting agriculture,' Bov\u00e9 told TV cameras on his triumphant release in September last year. 'Today, for the first time, there's a national consensus about bad food.

But now he is an international figure who has taken his campaigns to Seattle and to Brazil, a cunning media manipulator and the author of two best-selling books. He's only spent about a month on his farm all year, he says.</p> <p>Some people in France want him to stand for president and, given the unpopularity of the leading contenders Jospin and Chirac in the opinion polls, it's not an entirely barmy suggestion. True, in the New Year an appeal court in Montpellier may confirm his jail sentence for the McDonald's attack. True, his wife denounced him earlier this year in the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Paysanne magazine as a 'macho' man who had left her for another woman. But today he is a respected figure and Bov\u00e9's intervention in France's BSE scandal had been eagerly awaited. And here it is. Bov\u00e9 brandishes a dossier before the TV cameras that contains the Confederation Paysanne's report based on information procured from the customs officers in Toulouse. It demonstrates, he argues, the culpability not only of certain French beef farmers, but of successive Agriculture Ministers and administrators in illegally importing infected animal feed. The authorities had all this information in 1996, he says angrily.</p> <p>'Since then, though, nothing has been done. An investigating magistrate appointed to look into the affair in 1996 still hasn't opened the file and the Minister of Agriculture has covered up outrageous practices.

But they must be protected, because they could be menaced.'</p> <p>It's a brilliant coup de th\u00e9tre, to go to one part of the government to indict another, and to stand up for the little guys on the receiving end of a corrupt and inhuman international conspiracy. But it would be trite to suggest Bov\u00e9 is merely a silver-tongued media manipulator. That said, there aren't many peasants who could command the attention of Ministers and journalists alike, without diluting his radical message.</p> <p>'What must we do?', pipes up one journalist. 'There are three things,' says Bov\u00e9 quick as a flash. 'First, meat and bone meal must be banned immediately. Second, M. Jospin [the French Prime Minister] must work to get a European-wide policy on how to feed our animals. Third, beef farmers must be indemnified against the catastrophic fall in beef sales in France. Instead of producing a panic about beef, we must ensure that all cows more than two years old should be tested for the disease when sent for slaughter. Otherwise, we are going to destroy our beef farmers.'</p> <p>Clear stuff, and policies which the French President, Jacques Chirac, endorsed last week. Admittedly, there is a slight problem and one that Le Monde seized on last week. If meat and bone meal were banned, a vegetable-based replacement would have to be imported to replace it. But, according to the Blair House accords signed in 1992, European Community member states are obliged to buy a great deal of soya-based feeds from the US, most of which are made from genetically modified crops. It's a solution that Bov\u00e9 detests and which for him typifies the mess of unsustainable farming.</p> <p>'This is why we have to see the Prime Minister to get a new European policy on these matters.

      "bodyText": "Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9 smooths his luxuriant Asterix moustache, lights his rustic pipe and walks up to the TV cameras. He looks like a peasant, but he talks like a well-briefed government Minister. The rest of France may be in a panic about mad cow disease, but he at least is calm, convincing, coolly analytical. The real problem, he says, is this: Between 1993 and 1996, unscrupulous people in France illegally imported diseased animal feed from Britain. That's why France has a BSE problem. More than 14,000 tonnes of feed was smuggled into the country and entered the alimentary chain, poisoning France's livestock and threatening the health of her people. All this despite the fact that British meat and bone meal was banned in France as long ago as August 1989. So it's all Britain's fault? Bov\u00e9 glances at me dismissively. 'Not at all. It goes far beyond apportioning blame to the British. It was an aberrant system, and those who are responsible for it should be brought to book. That's happening in Britain, but in France no one has been brought to account yet.' The leader of the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration Paysanne, a militant French anti-globalisation group that represents the interests of many of France's more environmentally-conscious small farmers, is standing outside the opulent Justice Ministry in the Place Vend\u00f4me in Paris. He and some colleagues have just been in to see the Justice Minister Marylise Lebranchu and her officials to protest against government and judicial inaction over the scandal of illegally imported feed. He didn't have an appointment, but that didn't matter: when Bov\u00e9 arrives unannounced at the heart of French government these days, diaries are juggled, apologetic phone calls made and a scruffily dressed small man with a big dossier is ushered briskly into the corridors of power. The French press has called him the Robin Hood of peasants, fighting against multinational agro-industry Sheriffs of Nottingham, but the laborious comparison is bogus: there is nothing like Jose Bov\u00e9 in Britain, and there never has been. Rather, he is an utterly French symbol who has appropriated the facial hair of the country's most famous ancient Gaul and the bucolic manner of a true Gallic peasant. He's been hailed by the National Front and the Gaullists, the Socialists and the Greens. He has managed to achieve this remarkable appeal not only because of his ability to develop a critique of globalisation, but because his image and his lifestyle evoke a nostalgic vision of rural France. His is a France of wonderful cheeses, thumping great red wines and starry skies seen from rolling fields. All this, plus the fact that he vandalised a McDonald's burger joint - that icon of soulless Anglo-Saxon grub and destructive farming methods - has made him a French hero. The son of two university researchers, Bov\u00e9 was a child of May 1968 - left-wing, hairy, and committed to overthrowing the capitalist order. But even when he and his future wife, Alice, dropped out of Bordeaux university after the student riots, he was, as he recalls now, 'more Gandhi than Guevara'. Appropriately, in 1972 he refused to do military service and holed up at the farm of a market gardener in the Gironde. By now a member of the radical back-to-the-land movement, Bov\u00e9 went to the beautifully rugged Larzac plateau in the South-West of France to join a fight against the extension of a military camp. 'The peasants of the plateau had decided to install young farmers around the perimeter,' he remembers. 'And I became one of them.' In this way, they hoped to stop a firing range being built. Bov\u00e9, then, put himself on the front line against the military-industrial complex. There was no road to his house, no electricity, no water. There was, however, a baby to look after. But he knew he had found his spiritual home, and there he settled to raise sheep and make Roquefort cheese from their milk. 'When I arrived at the Larzac, I immediately sensed a coherence between the place and my aspirations. I had seen too many extreme left-wing militants blow a gasket. But at the Larzac I have something concrete. I'm not a bird on a branch, I am in the real world.' Bov\u00e9 is a great champion of community spirit in an age of individualism. 'The opposition to the military camp created an extraordinary solidarity. Zapata, Cesar Chavez or even the Chouans [the Breton peasants who fought against the French Revolution] - the struggles of the peasants throughout history and throughout the world have always been a collective adventure.' That adventure put him at the forefront of every left-wing militant battle in France for 30 years, from nuclear tests to highway extensions. But he became internationally known last year when he was imprisoned for leading a commando raid on a McDonald's under construction in the town of Millau, not far from his farm. The United States government, incensed that Europe had banned its hormone-injected beef, had slapped huge duties on French food imports - including Roquefort, such as that made by Bov\u00e9. In revenge, he and group of local peasants descended on the McDonald's with hammers and screwdrivers, after warning the local police what they were up to. It was a highly symbolic target. For the cheesemakers, goat farmers, fruit growers and poultry raisers of rural South-West France, McDonald's exemplified the grim march of globalisation. Bov\u00e9 was jailed, but hundreds of well-wishers from around France paid his \u00a310,500 bail.

'Today, for the first time, there's a national consensus about bad food.

      "body": "<p>Imagine a world designed by Disney, marketed by Nike, and described by Franz Kafka. When you wake up in this world, you think you are putting your clothes and shoes on, grabbing a coffee, getting in your car and filling it up with petrol; you think you are switching on your computer when you get to work and maybe having a cigarette or a soft drink at about 11. But you are sadly mistaken.</p> <p>What you are actually doing is buying into a lifestyle, having a 'deep emotional connection' with fitness or coffee. Of course, the clothes, the car, etc. really exist, but the plane on which you are experiencing them is a higher one, of ideas and aspirations. And behind the scenes of this enclosed, almost sci-fi universe of concepts and intangibilities is another, horrific one, in which you are exploiting people in sweatshops as you put on your shoes, working them to their deaths, and you are supporting the murder of a Nobel Peace Prizewinner as you fill up your car. We are all already living in this world. And for many the only way out seems to be to listen to Naomi Klein.</p> <p>Klein is the 30 year-old author of No Logo, a book which came out in Britain at the beginning of this year to rapturous reviews, and which has since developed a life of its own. It has been called a manifesto, 'the Das Kapital of the growing anti-corporate movement', and it set out to document the aims and rationale of the group that demonstrated at Seattle and Prague, before those events had even happened. Over the course of this year, No Logo has had a burgeoning, massive success, recommended by word of mouth; all over the world, people are sending loop emails to their friends, telling them how it has changed their life, how something they had felt but not understood has suddenly become clear. Klein now gives talks so often she jokes that she'll 'never write again', though she has a regular column in Canada's national newspaper, The Globe and Mail . This week she is in England, and speaking publicly every night. However, she rejects the idea that No Logo is a manifesto.</p> <p>'There is no Das Kapital for the anti-corporate movement,' she says. 'One of the best things about this movement is that no one is handing down a manifesto from on high.' Klein is extremely articulate both in writing and in conversation, but even so, in order to understand her and understand what's going on, you have to be able to embrace anarchy, to see how the chaos is organised. None of the old rules apply, and this is instantly in evidence when we meet.</p> <p>We have coffee at a private club in London, where Klein has been put up by her publisher. 'Are you part of this scene?' she whispers, still looking slightly dazed from last night's performance at the bar: Robbie Williams swanning around with paparazzi at his feet. 'No,' I mutter, 'I object to private clubs on principle.' She smiles sympathetically, and I interpret a tinge of pity for my unsophisticated view of left and right. As she makes clear in her book, we have to redefine our enemies, and, obviously, no one's going to change the world by not joining the Groucho Club.</p> <p>Klein is poised. She has a soft, pretty face and a sweet, unstrident Canadian voice. She wears glasses some of the time, and can look studious or glamorous, very noticeable or usefully hidden. You can imagine her travelling the world for her book, interviewing sweatshop workers in South-east Asia and schoolchildren in Canada; but you can see just as easily that she is the person you've read, who knows her Marx and her Guy Debord, and the person you've seen on stage, voicing the beliefs of an international political movement.</p> <p>No Logo is exhaustively researched - it's full of facts and figures, it contains tables and diagrams - but it's not dry. Klein illustrates points with her own experiences, and has conducted what must be hundreds of interviews. What the book does best, I think, is to conjure up a world view that seems paranoid but is in fact appropriately worried.</p> <p>In the 1980s, Klein explains, there was a shift in focus from manufacturing to marketing. The goods themselves became unimportant, and branding was what mattered. As production moved to the Third World, thousands of jobs were lost in the First, and meanwhile, the power of the brand was unstoppable. In 1998, Coca-Cola ran a competition in American schools to see who could come up with the best marketing strategy for distributing Coke coupons: one school staged an official Coke day, and when a rebel turned up in a Pepsi T-shirt, he was suspended.</p> <p>Klein quotes advertising executives, whose language is dizzyingly illogical: at Nike, for example, the product is nothing but 'the most important marketing tool'; Polaroid made the fatal marketing mistake of 'thinking they were a camera' (sic) - really, Polaroid is a 'social lubricant'. 'Products are made in the factory,' one adman says, 'but brands are made in the mind.'</p> <p>It is this mind-play that is so frightening. Exploitation of workers in sweatshops is bad enough, but when big corporations are promoting a lifestyle, it is all the more horrendous that the 'lifestyle' of production, behind the branding curtain, is no life at all. And perhaps the canniest corporate technique is the appropriation of politically aware language. At Nike, Tiger Woods blares from billboards: 'There are still courses in the US where I am not allowed to play, because of the color of my skin'. The revolution of identity politics has come to serve capitalism: what better mask for corruption could there be than an apparent battle against corruption? Corporations, as the anti-corporate movement is saying, are more powerful than governments, and they can turn anything to their advantage.</p> <p>For instance, 'culture jammers' replace billboard ads with scathing parodies of the same. 'A good jam,' Klein explains, 'is an X-ray of the subconscious of a campaign, uncovering not an opposite meaning but the deeper truth hiding beneath the layers of advertising euphemisms.'</p> <p>But then the advertisers see these adaptations as good jokes in themselves, and in a nightmarishly post-modern move adopt the idiom of the culture jam for their own ends. Over time, it seems barely noticeable: what was Situationist in the Sixties is Absolut Vodka in the Nineties. Marketing continues to absorb its opposition, and, as one activist in the book puts it, 'this generation wants their brains back'.</p> <p>Klein, however, tells me that 'this is not a youth movement. There's a great deal of co-operation going on - for instance, in the States, college-age students against sweatshops are working with labour leaders their parents' age. There isn't that vanguardist, don't-trust-anyone-over-30 bullshit that was so much a part of the Sixties'.</p> <p>But although Klein claims that the movement is not about a generation, a large number of those who have found guidance in her book are of a particular age. Many of us now in our twenties and thirties feel left behind by the political movements of the past century, too late for everything. It's become a clich\u00e9 to say that the Left has lost its way and that there is nothing to fight for. (Perhaps it's just that, as she puts it, 'it's a classic symptom of teenage narcissism to believe that the end of history coincides exactly with your arrival on Earth'.) Her book undoubtedly appeals to many more, but this is the group to whom it has given direction.</p> <p>And Klein seems perfectly placed to offer answers, since the history of her family is like a history of the Left. Philip Klein, her grandfather, was an animator at Disney, and organised the first strike there, as a result of which he was sacked and blacklisted. He taught her to 'always look for the dirt behind the shine'. Her parents left the United States in protest against the Vietnam war, and Naomi grew up in Canada, a child enamoured of the shiny symbols of capitalism: Barbie, Shell, McDonald's. Her mother made a controversial and influential documentary in 1980 called Not A Love Story, an anti-porn film about the life of a stripper. The backlash, or just the ordinary course, of her teenage life was to love the brands.</p> <p>But now, she says, 'what we're finding out is that our parents raised a bunch of really radical kids'. Although she says she can see a line, or rather many lines, from then to now, this movement is not inherited in quite the way the family story implies. 'You know,' she tells me, 'I object to any characterisation of this movement as somehow emerging from scratch. But I also equally object to characterisations that it's just the same old thing - you know, the Socialist Workers Party line, which is sort of, \"finally, the kids have realised the revolution is nigh\".'</p> <p>This movement (it is usually just 'this movement', without a longer name) is, Klein says, 'reserving the right to come up with solutions that are new. And that basically means taking a little bit from Marxism, a little bit from socialism, from environmentalism, from anarchism, and also a lot of inspiration is coming from even older places, and more indigenous theories about self-determination.</p> <p>'For example, the Zapatistas in Chiapas [Mexico] have been a real source of inspiration. But people often compare the movement to the Sixties, and I think that's not the right comparison - I think a much more interesting and appropriate parallel is with the Thirties, when there was a cross-generational, cross-sectoral, strong coalition.</p> <p>'The difference between then and now is that this is happening at a time of great prosperity. So I think it's somewhere in the middle,' she concludes. 'This is part of a history, but it is new, and the reason I think it's new is that I don't think it has articulated yet where it's going to go.'</p> <p>The unarticulated aims of the movement are, surely, what leaves it open to criticism, though? Klein responds by referring to the World Bank and the IMF: 'One thing to say to that is that an extraordinarily coherent vision can be really dangerous, and people get so attached to it and seduced by it that they force the world into it. And the other thing is that some of the people who have criticised this movement from the left don't remember how disorganised they were in their heyday.'</p> <p>When Klein wrote No Logo , she wasn't sure what the issues she was writing about would turn into. Now she is being hailed as a prophet. 'I wrote the book because I thought there was a movement, but it was an act of faith - I wanted there to be, but I knew at every stage that I could very well be wrong, that these little pockets that I was following could just be that. So I was surprised by Seattle - I'm constantly surprised. I was surprised that despite 11,000 police officers in Prague, protesters still made it into the conference centre and danced on the walls!'</p> <p>Things have changed since then, and she has clear views on what should be done next. 'I do a lot of speaking on university campuses and at activist gatherings and what I find now is that there is an amazing consensus - that we had the mass demonstrations, we've proved we exist, and in some ways we got a little bit ahead of ourselves, and this is a moment to take a step back and do some of that communications work and theoretical work. Which doesn't mean writing a movement manifesto that everybody's going to agree to. It means identifying what the core shared beliefs are across borders, and then organising it based on that.</p> <p>'I believe that the most fundamental core belief of this movement is self-determination, which actually means that the whole idea of coming up with a one-size-fits-all theory of how to run the world is completely antithetical to the process. So what you do is you think about mechanisms for real self-determination to take place.</p> <p>'You know, we hear about the militancy of Seattle or Prague but there's also a wave of direct action in native communities all over the place. Not just Chiapas, but where - rather than seeing their natural resources being depleted by logging companies or commercial fisheries - people are taking it into their own hands and creating blockades. It's happening more and more, and it's part of the same process of reclaiming things.'</p> <p>It's interesting to see the way Klein says 'we' when she refers to the movement. When she wrote her book, she set out to document something, and yet it has been received as a call to arms by those who were ready for one. What exactly is her relationship with her subject, I wonder?</p> <p>'Well,' she reflects, 'I do think it's strange that sometimes people call it a manifesto, because it's not. But I didn't do it purely as an act of journalism. I did it knowing how I'd become involved in it. I did understand my own relationship to politics, which is that the thing that sways me most is argument. I wanted it to be a journey where at the end you would be onside, and you would think it was inevitable.'</p> <p>The evening after our conversation, Klein gives a talk at a meeting of the World Development Movement, to launch the campaign against Gats (the General Agreement on Trade in Services), an agreement of the World Trade Organisation; 1,000 people are in attendance, and more than a hundred others are turned away. She speaks with great lucidity about how they should not see themselves as anti-trade, only as against the damaging conditions and strings attached to trade. She refers to the movement's roots in colonialism and resistance, and comes back, again and again, to the concept of self-determination. No jargon is resorted to, no issues are fudged.</p> <p>At one point, a Bolivian woman stands up to ask a question. 'Our services have been privatised.' she says. 'Is a riot enough to get our water back?' Klein looks straight at her and leans into the mike. 'No. It's not enough,' she admits, and offers other strategies for getting organised. 'Can we agree on what we're for?' Klein finally asks. 'How can we move from symbolic victories to deeper, more long-lasting change?'</p> <p>Over the course of the evening it becomes clear that Klein can and has made a difference because she is commentator, activist, and guide all at once. 'Our task is not to create a movement from scratch,' she proclaims to a rapt audience. 'Our task is to recognise the movement we already have.'</p> <p>Like the good witch in the Wizard of Oz who tells Dorothy that, in the form of ruby slippers, she has been wearing the means to her end all along, Klein is a prophet who sees the present. She just sees it better than anyone else.</p> <p>\u0095 Naomi Klein will be speaking at the V&amp;A in London today. For tickets call 020 7942 2209.

      "bodyText": "Imagine a world designed by Disney, marketed by Nike, and described by Franz Kafka. When you wake up in this world, you think you are putting your clothes and shoes on, grabbing a coffee, getting in your car and filling it up with petrol; you think you are switching on your computer when you get to work and maybe having a cigarette or a soft drink at about 11. But you are sadly mistaken. What you are actually doing is buying into a lifestyle, having a 'deep emotional connection' with fitness or coffee. Of course, the clothes, the car, etc. really exist, but the plane on which you are experiencing them is a higher one, of ideas and aspirations. And behind the scenes of this enclosed, almost sci-fi universe of concepts and intangibilities is another, horrific one, in which you are exploiting people in sweatshops as you put on your shoes, working them to their deaths, and you are supporting the murder of a Nobel Peace Prizewinner as you fill up your car. We are all already living in this world. And for many the only way out seems to be to listen to Naomi Klein. Klein is the 30 year-old author of No Logo, a book which came out in Britain at the beginning of this year to rapturous reviews, and which has since developed a life of its own. It has been called a manifesto, 'the Das Kapital of the growing anti-corporate movement', and it set out to document the aims and rationale of the group that demonstrated at Seattle and Prague, before those events had even happened. Over the course of this year, No Logo has had a burgeoning, massive success, recommended by word of mouth; all over the world, people are sending loop emails to their friends, telling them how it has changed their life, how something they had felt but not understood has suddenly become clear. Klein now gives talks so often she jokes that she'll 'never write again', though she has a regular column in Canada's national newspaper, The Globe and Mail . This week she is in England, and speaking publicly every night. However, she rejects the idea that No Logo is a manifesto. 'There is no Das Kapital for the anti-corporate movement,' she says. 'One of the best things about this movement is that no one is handing down a manifesto from on high.' Klein is extremely articulate both in writing and in conversation, but even so, in order to understand her and understand what's going on, you have to be able to embrace anarchy, to see how the chaos is organised. None of the old rules apply, and this is instantly in evidence when we meet. We have coffee at a private club in London, where Klein has been put up by her publisher. 'Are you part of this scene?' she whispers, still looking slightly dazed from last night's performance at the bar: Robbie Williams swanning around with paparazzi at his feet. 'No,' I mutter, 'I object to private clubs on principle.' She smiles sympathetically, and I interpret a tinge of pity for my unsophisticated view of left and right. As she makes clear in her book, we have to redefine our enemies, and, obviously, no one's going to change the world by not joining the Groucho Club. Klein is poised. She has a soft, pretty face and a sweet, unstrident Canadian voice. She wears glasses some of the time, and can look studious or glamorous, very noticeable or usefully hidden. You can imagine her travelling the world for her book, interviewing sweatshop workers in South-east Asia and schoolchildren in Canada; but you can see just as easily that she is the person you've read, who knows her Marx and her Guy Debord, and the person you've seen on stage, voicing the beliefs of an international political movement. No Logo is exhaustively researched - it's full of facts and figures, it contains tables and diagrams - but it's not dry. Klein illustrates points with her own experiences, and has conducted what must be hundreds of interviews. What the book does best, I think, is to conjure up a world view that seems paranoid but is in fact appropriately worried. In the 1980s, Klein explains, there was a shift in focus from manufacturing to marketing. The goods themselves became unimportant, and branding was what mattered. As production moved to the Third World, thousands of jobs were lost in the First, and meanwhile, the power of the brand was unstoppable. In 1998, Coca-Cola ran a competition in American schools to see who could come up with the best marketing strategy for distributing Coke coupons: one school staged an official Coke day, and when a rebel turned up in a Pepsi T-shirt, he was suspended. Klein quotes advertising executives, whose language is dizzyingly illogical: at Nike, for example, the product is nothing but 'the most important marketing tool'; Polaroid made the fatal marketing mistake of 'thinking they were a camera' (sic) - really, Polaroid is a 'social lubricant'. 'Products are made in the factory,' one adman says, 'but brands are made in the mind.' It is this mind-play that is so frightening. Exploitation of workers in sweatshops is bad enough, but when big corporations are promoting a lifestyle, it is all the more horrendous that the 'lifestyle' of production, behind the branding curtain, is no life at all. And perhaps the canniest corporate technique is the appropriation of politically aware language. At Nike, Tiger Woods blares from billboards: 'There are still courses in the US where I am not allowed to play, because of the color of my skin'. The revolution of identity politics has come to serve capitalism: what better mask for corruption could there be than an apparent battle against corruption? Corporations, as the anti-corporate movement is saying, are more powerful than governments, and they can turn anything to their advantage. For instance, 'culture jammers' replace billboard ads with scathing parodies of the same. 'A good jam,' Klein explains, 'is an X-ray of the subconscious of a campaign, uncovering not an opposite meaning but the deeper truth hiding beneath the layers of advertising euphemisms.' But then the advertisers see these adaptations as good jokes in themselves, and in a nightmarishly post-modern move adopt the idiom of the culture jam for their own ends. Over time, it seems barely noticeable: what was Situationist in the Sixties is Absolut Vodka in the Nineties. Marketing continues to absorb its opposition, and, as one activist in the book puts it, 'this generation wants their brains back'. Klein, however, tells me that 'this is not a youth movement. There's a great deal of co-operation going on - for instance, in the States, college-age students against sweatshops are working with labour leaders their parents' age. There isn't that vanguardist, don't-trust-anyone-over-30 bullshit that was so much a part of the Sixties'. But although Klein claims that the movement is not about a generation, a large number of those who have found guidance in her book are of a particular age. Many of us now in our twenties and thirties feel left behind by the political movements of the past century, too late for everything. It's become a clich\u00e9 to say that the Left has lost its way and that there is nothing to fight for. (Perhaps it's just that, as she puts it, 'it's a classic symptom of teenage narcissism to believe that the end of history coincides exactly with your arrival on Earth'.) Her book undoubtedly appeals to many more, but this is the group to whom it has given direction. And Klein seems perfectly placed to offer answers, since the history of her family is like a history of the Left. Philip Klein, her grandfather, was an animator at Disney, and organised the first strike there, as a result of which he was sacked and blacklisted. He taught her to 'always look for the dirt behind the shine'. Her parents left the United States in protest against the Vietnam war, and Naomi grew up in Canada, a child enamoured of the shiny symbols of capitalism: Barbie, Shell, McDonald's. Her mother made a controversial and influential documentary in 1980 called Not A Love Story, an anti-porn film about the life of a stripper. The backlash, or just the ordinary course, of her teenage life was to love the brands. But now, she says, 'what we're finding out is that our parents raised a bunch of really radical kids'. Although she says she can see a line, or rather many lines, from then to now, this movement is not inherited in quite the way the family story implies. 'You know,' she tells me, 'I object to any characterisation of this movement as somehow emerging from scratch. But I also equally object to characterisations that it's just the same old thing - you know, the Socialist Workers Party line, which is sort of, \"finally, the kids have realised the revolution is nigh\".' This movement (it is usually just 'this movement', without a longer name) is, Klein says, 'reserving the right to come up with solutions that are new. And that basically means taking a little bit from Marxism, a little bit from socialism, from environmentalism, from anarchism, and also a lot of inspiration is coming from even older places, and more indigenous theories about self-determination. 'For example, the Zapatistas in Chiapas [Mexico] have been a real source of inspiration. But people often compare the movement to the Sixties, and I think that's not the right comparison - I think a much more interesting and appropriate parallel is with the Thirties, when there was a cross-generational, cross-sectoral, strong coalition. 'The difference between then and now is that this is happening at a time of great prosperity. So I think it's somewhere in the middle,' she concludes. 'This is part of a history, but it is new, and the reason I think it's new is that I don't think it has articulated yet where it's going to go.' The unarticulated aims of the movement are, surely, what leaves it open to criticism, though? Klein responds by referring to the World Bank and the IMF: 'One thing to say to that is that an extraordinarily coherent vision can be really dangerous, and people get so attached to it and seduced by it that they force the world into it. And the other thing is that some of the people who have criticised this movement from the left don't remember how disorganised they were in their heyday.' When Klein wrote No Logo , she wasn't sure what the issues she was writing about would turn into. Now she is being hailed as a prophet. 'I wrote the book because I thought there was a movement, but it was an act of faith - I wanted there to be, but I knew at every stage that I could very well be wrong, that these little pockets that I was following could just be that. So I was surprised by Seattle - I'm constantly surprised. I was surprised that despite 11,000 police officers in Prague, protesters still made it into the conference centre and danced on the walls!' Things have changed since then, and she has clear views on what should be done next. 'I do a lot of speaking on university campuses and at activist gatherings and what I find now is that there is an amazing consensus - that we had the mass demonstrations, we've proved we exist, and in some ways we got a little bit ahead of ourselves, and this is a moment to take a step back and do some of that communications work and theoretical work. Which doesn't mean writing a movement manifesto that everybody's going to agree to. It means identifying what the core shared beliefs are across borders, and then organising it based on that. 'I believe that the most fundamental core belief of this movement is self-determination, which actually means that the whole idea of coming up with a one-size-fits-all theory of how to run the world is completely antithetical to the process. So what you do is you think about mechanisms for real self-determination to take place. 'You know, we hear about the militancy of Seattle or Prague but there's also a wave of direct action in native communities all over the place. Not just Chiapas, but where - rather than seeing their natural resources being depleted by logging companies or commercial fisheries - people are taking it into their own hands and creating blockades. It's happening more and more, and it's part of the same process of reclaiming things.' It's interesting to see the way Klein says 'we' when she refers to the movement. When she wrote her book, she set out to document something, and yet it has been received as a call to arms by those who were ready for one. What exactly is her relationship with her subject, I wonder? 'Well,' she reflects, 'I do think it's strange that sometimes people call it a manifesto, because it's not. But I didn't do it purely as an act of journalism. I did it knowing how I'd become involved in it. I did understand my own relationship to politics, which is that the thing that sways me most is argument. I wanted it to be a journey where at the end you would be onside, and you would think it was inevitable.' The evening after our conversation, Klein gives a talk at a meeting of the World Development Movement, to launch the campaign against Gats (the General Agreement on Trade in Services), an agreement of the World Trade Organisation; 1,000 people are in attendance, and more than a hundred others are turned away. She speaks with great lucidity about how they should not see themselves as anti-trade, only as against the damaging conditions and strings attached to trade. She refers to the movement's roots in colonialism and resistance, and comes back, again and again, to the concept of self-determination. No jargon is resorted to, no issues are fudged. At one point, a Bolivian woman stands up to ask a question. 'Our services have been privatised.' she says. 'Is a riot enough to get our water back?' Klein looks straight at her and leans into the mike. 'No. It's not enough,' she admits, and offers other strategies for getting organised. 'Can we agree on what we're for?' Klein finally asks. 'How can we move from symbolic victories to deeper, more long-lasting change?' Over the course of the evening it becomes clear that Klein can and has made a difference because she is commentator, activist, and guide all at once. 'Our task is not to create a movement from scratch,' she proclaims to a rapt audience. 'Our task is to recognise the movement we already have.' Like the good witch in the Wizard of Oz who tells Dorothy that, in the form of ruby slippers, she has been wearing the means to her end all along, Klein is a prophet who sees the present. She just sees it better than anyone else. \u0095 Naomi Klein will be speaking at the V&amp;A in London today. For tickets call 020 7942 2209.

The aim will be to ensure that no single person has an income below \u00a3100 a week in 2003 (\u00a35,200 a year), and no couple will have less than \u00a3154 a week (\u00a38008 a year). </p> <p>Those without savings or private pensions will receive no further state income, although they will usually be entitled to other state help, such as housing benefit. </p> <p>The second top-up will come from the new Pension Credit, for pensioners with savings. But even so, there will be no extra state money for those with incomes of more than \u00a3135 a week (\u00a37,020 a year). For couples, the cut-off level for state assistance will be \u00a3201 a week, or \u00a310,452. </p> <p>Many pensioners are now denied means-tested supplements to their basic pensions because they have modest private incomes. They may be only a couple of pounds better off than a neighbour supported entirely by the state who has saved nothing. </p> <p>For those who qualify for Pensions Credit, every \u00a31 of savings will earn a credit of 60p. Pensioners' entitlement will not be affected by the amount of capital they have; the capital limits that govern today's means testing will be abolished. Nor will the Government assume - as it does now when means testing - that pensioners' savings earn 20 per cent interest. However, it has not yet been decided how pensioners' income from savings will be calculated. </p> <p>Under the new Pension Credit, a single man on the basic state pension of \u00a377, the level projected by the Government for 2003, plus \u00a320 from part-time work, will have an income of \u00a397 a week. The Government will top this up to \u00a3100, its minimum income guarantee. The pensioner will then receive an extra \u00a312 from the pension credit (20 x 60p), so his total income will be \u00a3112 a week. </p> <p>A single woman on the basic state pension receiving \u00a323 a week from a former employer, would already have a large enough income to meet the Government's \u00a3100 minimum income level. But she would receive a top-up because of her private pension. This would work out at \u00a313.80 a week (23 x 60p). </p> <p>The new system will continue to require that pensioners claim for top-ups to the basic state pension. </p> <p>To help pensioners before the introduction of the new system, the Government is planning a series of significant increases to the basic state pension and the minimum income guarantee. </p> <p>Copies of the Government's paper on the Pension Credit are available by calling 020 8867 3201.

Under the new Pension Credit, a single man on the basic state pension of \u00a377, the level projected by the Government for 2003, plus \u00a320 from part-time work, will have an income of \u00a397 a week. The Government will top this up to \u00a3100, its minimum income guarantee. The pensioner will then receive an extra \u00a312 from the pension credit (20 x 60p), so his total income will be \u00a3112 a week. A single woman on the basic state pension receiving \u00a323 a week from a former employer, would already have a large enough income to meet the Government's \u00a3100 minimum income level. But she would receive a top-up because of her private pension. This would work out at \u00a313.80 a week (23 x 60p). The new system will continue to require that pensioners claim for top-ups to the basic state pension. To help pensioners before the introduction of the new system, the Government is planning a series of significant increases to the basic state pension and the minimum income guarantee. Copies of the Government's paper on the Pension Credit are available by calling 020 8867 3201. The paper is also available on the internet at www.dss.gov.uk.",

      "body": "<p>Planning to be faithful for the rest of your life to just one bank? Don't be surprised if your bank doesn't feel obliged to reciprocate. The major banks long ago abandoned the idea that they had anything more than a business relationship with their customers. Unfortunately, it's taken time for most of us to realise that the rules have changed and that these days, sadly, loyalty counts for little. </p> <p>Take interest rates, for example. When interest payments on credit balances were first introduced, the step was seen as a major advance for consumers. But interest payments have been all but abolished. Barclays, NatWest, HSBC and Lloyds have all reduced the interest on standard current accounts to a pitiful 0.1 per cent before tax. </p> <p>Why blame the banks, however, when customers seem prepared to stay put? A recent Consumers Association survey of 10,000 Which? readers found, for example, that NatWest customers on average had held their accounts for 22 years. Yet only 15 per cent said they would choose the same bank a second time, giving their own bank the worst report of the 14 banks surveyed. </p> <p>According to Melanie Green, CA senior researcher , only a small percentage of people actually get round to moving accounts. 'People's perception is that there is not that much difference between banks. It's a lot of effort to move accounts, so what's the point? But there is quite a lot of difference, in terms of both costs and customer satisfaction,' she says. </p> <p>The logic of the banking industry today is that we should probably consider changing our bank accounts about as frequently as we change our cars. This won't happen. Nevertheless, the major banks are anxiously aware that they will not be able to rely indefinitely on customer inertia. </p> <p>Competition is intensifying, and there is increasing pressure among banks to merge. Mergers can lead to reduced competition - but not always. Had merger talks between Bank of Scotland and Abbey National succeeded, the combined group could have been in a better position to attack the current account custom of the big four. The Abbey/Bank of Scotland deal may have faltered, but there will be more to come in this crowded industry. </p> <p>Halifax's announcement last month that it would be increasing the standard interest rate from 0.25 per cent to 4 per cent from January for many of its current account customers may prove to be the start of a new battle for customers. The Halifax has about 5 per cent of the British current account market, and its sights are set on doubling this within five years. The traditional big four, with 80 per cent of the current account market, are the target. </p> <p>The Halifax initiative anticipates a radical change in the way the industry will handle the transfer of standing orders and direct debits when customers decide to move banks. This remains for many people the biggest single obstacle to switching, as Don Cruickshank pointed out in his damning report on the banking industry, which was published last spring. </p> <p>The banks, which have hardly rushed in the past to tackle this issue, now plan to introduce an automated direct debit transfer system through the bank clearing system, Bacs - but not until the end of next year. </p> <p>In the meantime, under the revised voluntary banking code of conduct, banks are supposed to co-operate to ensure their customers can move their accounts as smoothly as possible. Some, but not all, banks are going a step further and, under a Bacs-sponsored pilot programme, are offering to handle the transfer arrangements for direct debits and standing orders for new customers. </p> <p>The Bacs pilot, which is based on the old-fashioned exchange of paper-based records, initially involved the Abbey National, Co-op, Halifax, Nationwide, RBS, Ulster Bank, Virgin One and Woolwich, and has more recently been joined by Barclays, Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale/Yorkshire/Northern group. However, in some cases only particular branches are participating. 'It's fiddly to move accounts, especially if you've got a busy current account with lots of standing orders and direct debits,' says Green of the CA. However she adds: 'Those who do it generally say that it wasn't as bad as they'd thought.' </p> <p>The main problem is not standing orders, which are relatively straightforward, but direct debits, since these allow other organisations the right to dip into individual bank accounts to remove money. On the positive side, changing banks does allow you the chance to review your existing arrangements, checking whether they all remain appropriate to your needs. </p> <p>Splitting up with your existing bank is all very well, but how do you decide where to move to? The past 10 years has seen increasing segmentation as banks attempt to identify their more profitable customers and spend proportionately less effort on the rest. The segmentation process is being extended downwards by the introduction (initially by NatWest and Lloyds TSB) of basic bank accounts and the proposed creation of a Post Office-based universal bank account service, primarily designed for the estimated 3.5 million people without a current account. </p> <p>Leaving aside both basic bank accounts and, at the other end of the scale, the bespoke personal bank services available for the seriously rich, there are broadly four choices of bank account now available. </p> <p>One is the packaged bank account, where standard current account facilities are bundled together with other financial and non-financial services. A typical packaged bank account is likely to offer such things as automatic card protection insurance, discounts on car hire and insurance and possibly other travel and shopping special offers. </p> <p>However, these extra services cost money (sometimes dressed up as a 'membership subscription'): \u00a34 a month for Lloyds' Select account, for example, \u00a36 a month for Barclays Additions and \u00a39 a month for RBS's Royalties Gold. The number of packaged bank accounts, which appear to appeal par ticularly to middle-aged professionals, has doubled to an estimated 3 million since 1998. </p> <p>For the best interest rates, however, look to the new online bank accounts. Abbey National's e-bank, Cahoot, is currently ahead of the field, paying 4.9 per cent gross on all credit balances (Cahoot pays even more if you are prepared to do without a cheque book). The Irish-based First-e pays 4.88 per cent, while the Co-op's Smile bank is close behind, offering 4.75 per cent. </p> <p>Some of the industry's enthusiasm for internet banking subsidiaries has disappeared in recent months, partly as a result of well-publicised security problems and partly because of the general fall from favour of new dotcom businesses. It is also not as easy to set up a standalone internet bank as some people thought initially, as the Halifax's teething problems in launching Intelligent Finance (IF) testify. </p> <p>Nevertheless, the extremely low costs involved in administering online transactions mean that Internet-based banks should continue to be able to offer good rates of interest. </p> <p>Halifax's IF straddles two categories of bank account, copying the Virgin One idea of combining a bank account and mortgage loan in a single product. The idea is an enticing one: why pay a high rate of interest on your mortgage and, separately, receive a low rate of interest on your current account balances? By combining what you owe with what you are lending back to your bank via your current account, the theory is that you can pay interest only on the net amount you are borrowing. </p> <p>Combined bank and mortgage accounts are offered by a number of other institutions, including the Woolwich, Yorkshire Bank and First Active. </p> <p>Moving to a combined account does, however, limit your choice of mortgage borrower and locks you into a very close relationship with your chosen company. In practice, these sorts of accounts are likely to remain niche products. </p> <p>The vast majority of us, it seems, are still happy to make do with a traditional branch-based current account, operating in the usual way. </p> <p>The Halifax's decision to attack the big four banks' dominance of this market next January is a tacit recognition of this fact. By increasing the interest rate to 4 per cent and reducing the overdraft rate to 10 per cent, the Halifax is also looking to squeeze considerably the traditional profit margins enjoyed on current account banking business </p> <p>However the Halifax's Shane O'Riordain argues that the rates are sustainable. 'Current accounts, together with credit cards and personal loans, are the areas in personal banking with the most generous margins, and they're also the least competitive ones,' he says. </p> <p>'Traditional banks make more than twice as much on current accounts as we do on mortgages. Our own research suggests that people are becoming more price-sensitive, and that there is a major shift in the way people are looking at current accounts.' </p> <p>The Halifax's 4 per cent headline rate takes it substantially above the current high street market leader, the Nationwide, which pays 1.45 per cent on balances up to \u00a35,000, and tiered rates up to 2.75 per cent above that. </p> <p>However, the Halifax's new rates will only apply automatically where at least \u00a31,000 is credited each month to the account. Less well-off customers will find the account terms less generous. </p> <p>Arguably, too, high interest on credit balances is not necessarily the most important feature of a current account - canny customers with money in their accounts should transfer any excess into a higher-rate savings account at the first opportunity. </p> <p>Green from the Consumers' Association also advises caution when comparing overdraft interest rates. </p> <p>'The really big difference on overdraft costs is whether an overdraft fee is charged,' she says. Some banks add a usage fee, typically \u00a35 a month (though \u00a37 at Northern Rock and \u00a38 at the Co-operative), even when overdrafts have been authorised in advance. Others charge an arrangement fee when overdraft facilities are first set up. </p> <p>Among the big players, Nationwide, Abbey National, Halifax, Lloyds TSB, and Yorkshire Bank commendably make only interest charges on arranged overdrafts. However, the situation changes markedly for unauthorised overdrafts, where almost all banks maintain the right to impose swingeing penalties. </p> <p>Less easy to assess than interest rates and overdraft charges are the customer service on offer. There has been a move away from the centrality of the local branch in customer relations with banks. Branches have been redefined as primarily marketing centres; routine administration has been removed to centralised back-offices; and telephone calls from customers are routed to call-handling centres. </p> <p>In its recent Which? survey, the Consumers Association reported an astonishing contrast between First Direct and Nationwide customers, two-thirds of whom said they would definitely choose the same bank again, and those people banking with Clydesdale, the Halifax and NatWest, where less than one in five said they would stay loyal. </p> <p>Also near the bottom of the table were Lloyds TSB, Barclays and Abbey National. The moral, according to Green, is that changing your bank really can make a difference. </p> <p><strong>Forty years - and not a backwards glance</strong></p> <p>John Fletcher was a loyal Barclays customer for over 40 years, with an affection for the company based on a family connection: his father had been employed as an assistant branch manager with Barclays. But his link with Barclays has now gone. Earlier this year, John and his wife Sylvia took the major step of moving their current account away from Barclays, in their case choosing to go to the Halifax. </p> <p>The immediate impetus for change was Barclays' announcement that they were closing the Fletchers' nearest branch, at Roade near Northampton. But the Fletchers had other dissatisfactions. </p> <p>'They didn't seem interested in you as a customer,' John says. 'Also I took exception to some of the things they were doing, such as the excessive salaries being paid to the chairman and chief executive. I decided there was no point writing to anyone - the only thing I could do was to move.' </p> <p>As he explains, however, the idea of moving current accounts was not one he was relishing. A past career move had meant that he had transferred his Barclays account from a branch in Derbyshire to one in Northants, and this internal transfer, he says, had not been without problems. The idea of moving banks altogether caused him some apprehension. </p> <p>In practice, however, his worries were unfounded. 'The Halifax asked us to sign a form and they then sorted out all the direct debits and standing orders. Everything slipped into place, and as far as we were concerned it was painless.' </p> <p>How do you decide where to take your custom if, like the Fletchers you have remained with one bank for many years? John and Sylvia did not pore over interest rate comparison tables or weigh up competing overdraft deals; instead they opted for the old-fashioned personal approach, the plan being to shop around in Northampton to see which bank seemed competent in handling the transfer. They began, and ended, at the Halifax, where they already held an investment. </p> <p>John remains irritated by his treatment at the hands of Barclays. 'What has really annoyed me is that, after 40 years, Barclays never asked me why I moved. They never approached me at all. And there's another thing: I was never offered interest in my current account before. </p> <p>'I knew some Barclays customers did get interest, but I was never offered it,' he says. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, he is looking forward to the 4 per cent interest promised by the Halifax after January. </p> <p>Barclays has admitted that its recent branch closure programme and its Big Bank advertising has lost it friends, and has announced that it will be more sensitive to public opinion in future. But other big clearing banks may need to take note of people like the Fletchers, if they are to keep their current strong customer base. </p> <p>It's not only current account business that's at stake: the big four also dominate credit cards in Britain on the back of their personal banking business. </p> <p>'I changed my credit card from Barclays at the same time as moving my account,' John says.</p> <p><strong>What's on offer</strong></p> <p><strong> Interest paid </strong><br> Internet banks pay the best interest. But there is movement on traditional accounts. From January, the Halifax's 4 per cent will be highly competitive, but only for accounts receiving \u00a31,000 a month (or other accounts when the balance is above \u00a31,000.) Best of the rest is the Nationwide. </p> <p><strong> Overdraft arrangements </strong><br> Only of concern if you expect to be in the red. Choose a bank which only charges interest, not fees. Fee-free overdraft 'buffers' are normally available to customers from, among others, Smile (\u00a3500), First Direct (\u00a3500), Cahoot (\u00a3250), Co-op (\u00a3250), HSBC (\u00a350), Woolwich (\u00a350) and NatWest (\u00a350). Barclays offers a paltry \u00a320 buffer, Lloyds TSB \u00a310. (Information from Moneyfacts). </p> <p><strong> Online banking </strong><br> With HSBC offering internet banking as an option this summer, almost all the major banks have online facilities. Telephone banking is also routinely available. No internet option at Yorkshire Bank, RBS, Northern Rock or Clydesdale. </p> <p><strong> Branch location </strong><br> Three-quarters of bank customers continue to rely on high street branches. Lloyds TSB has the largest number of branches, thanks to its takeover of TSB, with just over 2,200 branches at the end of last year. Barclays was in second place at 1,899 before its unpopular branch closure programme this year. The trend is firmly downwards. Do not assume that existing branches in small towns, estates or inner-cities will necessarily survive much longer. </p> <p><strong> ATMs </strong><br> British cash machines are now effectively all linked, but not every bank offers free use of all machines. Government pressure earlier this year forced banks such as Barclays, which had considered imposing ATM charges on non-customers, to think again. The best bet for continuing free use of the network looks most likely at those institutions which have taken a principled stand: try Nationwide and RBS. </p> <p><strong> Travelling abroad </strong><br> The best deal is from the Nationwide, which offers commission-free access to cash abroad, through all Visa branded cash machines.</p>",

The major banks long ago abandoned the idea that they had anything more than a business relationship with their customers. Unfortunately, it's taken time for most of us to realise that the rules have changed and that these days, sadly, loyalty counts for little. Take interest rates, for example. When interest payments on credit balances were first introduced, the step was seen as a major advance for consumers. But interest payments have been all but abolished. Barclays, NatWest, HSBC and Lloyds have all reduced the interest on standard current accounts to a pitiful 0.1 per cent before tax. Why blame the banks, however, when customers seem prepared to stay put? A recent Consumers Association survey of 10,000 Which? readers found, for example, that NatWest customers on average had held their accounts for 22 years. Yet only 15 per cent said they would choose the same bank a second time, giving their own bank the worst report of the 14 banks surveyed. According to Melanie Green, CA senior researcher , only a small percentage of people actually get round to moving accounts. 'People's perception is that there is not that much difference between banks. It's a lot of effort to move accounts, so what's the point? But there is quite a lot of difference, in terms of both costs and customer satisfaction,' she says. The logic of the banking industry today is that we should probably consider changing our bank accounts about as frequently as we change our cars. This won't happen. Nevertheless, the major banks are anxiously aware that they will not be able to rely indefinitely on customer inertia. Competition is intensifying, and there is increasing pressure among banks to merge. Mergers can lead to reduced competition - but not always. Had merger talks between Bank of Scotland and Abbey National succeeded, the combined group could have been in a better position to attack the current account custom of the big four. The Abbey/Bank of Scotland deal may have faltered, but there will be more to come in this crowded industry. Halifax's announcement last month that it would be increasing the standard interest rate from 0.25 per cent to 4 per cent from January for many of its current account customers may prove to be the start of a new battle for customers. The Halifax has about 5 per cent of the British current account market, and its sights are set on doubling this within five years. The traditional big four, with 80 per cent of the current account market, are the target. The Halifax initiative anticipates a radical change in the way the industry will handle the transfer of standing orders and direct debits when customers decide to move banks. This remains for many people the biggest single obstacle to switching, as Don Cruickshank pointed out in his damning report on the banking industry, which was published last spring. The banks, which have hardly rushed in the past to tackle this issue, now plan to introduce an automated direct debit transfer system through the bank clearing system, Bacs - but not until the end of next year.

Some, but not all, banks are going a step further and, under a Bacs-sponsored pilot programme, are offering to handle the transfer arrangements for direct debits and standing orders for new customers. The Bacs pilot, which is based on the old-fashioned exchange of paper-based records, initially involved the Abbey National, Co-op, Halifax, Nationwide, RBS, Ulster Bank, Virgin One and Woolwich, and has more recently been joined by Barclays, Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale/Yorkshire/Northern group.
