      "bodyText": "A \"virtual Commons\" where voters can debate issues and quiz MPs online should be set up in a bid to fight voter apathy, an influential thinktank claimed today. The specially commissioned report by Citizens Online and the Institute for Public Policy Research also calls on local councils to install kiosks where people can log on and give their views on issues affecting their town or region. John Fisher, the chief executive of Citizens Online, said: \"This is an opportunity to realise democracy online and should be at the heart of the modernising government agenda. \"This is not just about emailing the prime minister or watching a video stream of the budget - it's about creating a new and innovative component for representative governance in the 21st century.\" The document, titled \"Realising Democracy Online; A civic Commons in cyberspace\", criticises the mass media for \"sucking both the substance and spirit out of the politics it projects.\" It warns that this reliance on newspapers, TV and radio makes people sceptical about the quality of the information they are getting, and forces politicians to use soundbites to get a message across rather than spelling out their ideas in detail. The report goes on to suggest that the internet has the potential for creating more of a dialogue between those governed and those in government. \"We feel that the needs of the citizen and democracy are not very well served by the present mainstream, mass media-based communication system,\" said Jay Blumler, emeritus professor of public communications at the University of Leeds. He is co-author of the report with Stephen Coleman, the director of the Hansard Society's e-democracy programme. The report makes the point that the chancellor produces a pre-budget consultation paper which is only circulated in the City - it adds that if this was opened up to the web, more people and professions would be represented in the thinking behind treasury decisions. It goes on to contrast an \"inert and sulky\" concept of citizenship where an ill-informed public switches off from political life, or an empowering dialogue between elected representatives and the people. Prof Blumler said the age in which people were happy for politicians to make decisions without consulting them was coming to an end. So far, politicians have done little to tap this surge of opinion, few MPs are contactable via email and even fewer have their own website.

      "body": "<p>Is Jack Straw a widely-popular and successful home secretary? Or is he an authoritarian opponent of freedom of information and trial by jury, as painted by civil libertarians? The answer to these questions may decide whether he is a contender for the top job if Tony Blair stands down and Gordon Brown fails to unite the cabinet behind him.</p> <p>The real answer is that Mr Straw, widely seen as a decent man in politics, is a sure-footed, practical improver and cunning tactician. Nowhere was this clearer than in his handling of the Pinochet imbroglio from October 1998 onwards. The Tory right were seeking to canonise the Chilean ex-dictator while leftwing MPs hoped to crucify him. Mr Straw successfully got Pinochet off his hands and handed him back to Chile.</p> <p>Part of his reputation as an authoritarian is hardly his fault. The short-lived Cabinet Office minister David Clark's liberating freedom of information white paper, published in 1998 and subsequently watered down, could never have got by the restrictive lord chancellor, Derry Irvine. But Mr Straw took the blame. He also brought in his own much more restrictive version, getting it on the statute books in 2000.</p> <p>Mr Straw has shown similar determination in his effort to limit trial by jury for petty criminals who, he argues, are \"playing the system\" very expensively. He sees this as a practical reform, not a betrayal of principle. He took the same view about legislation allowing the security services to intercept private emails.</p> <p>Mr Straw has been just as pragmatic in accepting cabinet decisions which run against his sympathies. Nobody who knows him doubts he still fervently supports first-past-the-post and had doubts about the closed list system of proportional representation. But he accepted this in Scotland and Wales as part of Tony Blair's \"project\" to cosy up with the Liberal Democrats, for whom he himself has no time.</p> <p>He is not in the Blairites inner-circle but bides his time on its outer soft-left fringe. His views derive from a practical, pragmatic examination of his own experience and those of his constituents.</p> <p>When Gordon Brown was worrying about the danger of a skills shortage, as made fashionable by US president Bill Clinton's adviser Robert Reich, Mr Straw privately pointed to the tens of thousands of skilled workers sacked in two recessions.</p> <p>His ability to identify with his Blackburn constituents troubled by \"neighbours from hell\" on their council estates came from his own experience as a child on a council estate in Loughton, Essex. His father, Arthur, was an insurance clerk and conscientious objector who had met his mother, a teacher, in the peace pledge union. They were divorced when he was ten and he was brought up by a single mother. \"We had very little money. There were five children and no father but we didn't get into trouble.\"</p> <p>If he is strong on anti-racism, announcing an immediate inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence case, it is partly because of his experience at Brentwood school where he became deputy head boy but was bullied.</p> <p>An Aldermaston marcher at 12, a Labour party member by 15, he started on the sensible left as president of Leeds student union and the national union of students. His ambition for political office was whetted on Islington borough council.</p> <p>He gave up the bar to become, at 27, special adviser to Barbara Castle at the Department of Social Security. He also met his wife Alice Perkins during his time there. She was a high flying junior civil servant, and is currently deputy to Richard Wilson, the cabinet secretary. The Straws are the most formidable power couple in Whitehall.</p> <p>His time with Barbara Castle left him not only with a wife but also a deep-rooted Euroscepticism. This continued when she was sacked by James Callaghan in 1976. Mr Straw swiftly became adviser to Peter Shore, the Europhobe environment secretary.</p> <p>With Mr Shore, he helped found the Labour common market safeguards committee, urging withdrawal from the EEC at Labour's 1980 Wembley conference. He was on Mr Shore's leadership campaign team too in 1980 and again in 1983.</p> <p>When Barbara Castle decided to retire from safe Blackburn, she recommended Jack Straw, who had already contested hopeless Tonbridge, as her parliamentary successor, which he became in 1979.</p> <p>His party loyalism is of long standing. He tried to dissuade Tony Benn from contesting the deputy leadership against Denis Healey in 1981. He attacked both the SDP deserters and the radicals who provoked them into deserting. When Militant tried to unseat him at Blackburn, he secured 70% backing for the long procedure to expel the Blackburn Six. After Labour's 1983 defeat he warned that a majority of voters opposed its anti-nuclear defence policies. He later advised that London's loony-left councils were making the party unelectable.</p> <p>As Labour's education spokesman 1987-92, Mr Straw increasingly fought a two-front war against Kenneth Baker and the Tories facing him and against the Bennite hard-left \"flat earthers\" behind him. It was then that he formed an alliance with Gordon Brown and Tony Blair in opposition to a joint slate for the shadow cabinet linking the soft-left Tribune group and the hard-left Campaign group of Tony Benn.</p> <p>As education spokesman, he kept the teachers' unions at arms' length and insisted on frequent testing, high educational standards, quality control and consumer choice. He was, after all, a teacher's son.</p> <p>He was the first in the \"reform Clause IV\" field with his 1993 pamphlet, 'Policy and Ideology', angering Labour's leader, John Smith, who thought it was a dead issue. He also advocated downgrading the monarchy to Scandinavian proportions.</p> <p>When Tony Blair succeeded to the leadership in 1994, he handed over to Jack Straw his portfolio of shadow home secretary. Famously, Mr Straw attacked aggressive beggars and squeegee merchants. But he failed to make an expected triumph over home secretary Michael Howard's sacking of Derek Lewis, the prison services chief, because of Tory heckling and his own tinnitus. To his embarrassment Mr Blair even took to the despatch box to challenge Mr Howard. Yet only months later, Mr Straw was doing Mr Howard's job.</p> <p>He has done it ever since, a reassuring figure in the New Labour pantheon: confident, able and modestly ambitious. These are traits which may yet put him in the running to enter Number 10.</p> <p><a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/person/0,9290,-5038,00.html\">Ask Aristotle about Jack Straw</a></p>",

The short-lived Cabinet Office minister David Clark's liberating freedom of information white paper, published in 1998 and subsequently watered down, could never have got by the restrictive lord chancellor, Derry Irvine. But Mr Straw took the blame. He also brought in his own much more restrictive version, getting it on the statute books in 2000. Mr Straw has shown similar determination in his effort to limit trial by jury for petty criminals who, he argues, are \"playing the system\" very expensively. He sees this as a practical reform, not a betrayal of principle. He took the same view about legislation allowing the security services to intercept private emails. Mr Straw has been just as pragmatic in accepting cabinet decisions which run against his sympathies. Nobody who knows him doubts he still fervently supports first-past-the-post and had doubts about the closed list system of proportional representation. But he accepted this in Scotland and Wales as part of Tony Blair's \"project\" to cosy up with the Liberal Democrats, for whom he himself has no time. He is not in the Blairites inner-circle but bides his time on its outer soft-left fringe. His views derive from a practical, pragmatic examination of his own experience and those of his constituents. When Gordon Brown was worrying about the danger of a skills shortage, as made fashionable by US president Bill Clinton's adviser Robert Reich, Mr Straw privately pointed to the tens of thousands of skilled workers sacked in two recessions. His ability to identify with his Blackburn constituents troubled by \"neighbours from hell\" on their council estates came from his own experience as a child on a council estate in Loughton, Essex. His father, Arthur, was an insurance clerk and conscientious objector who had met his mother, a teacher, in the peace pledge union. They were divorced when he was ten and he was brought up by a single mother. \"We had very little money. There were five children and no father but we didn't get into trouble.\" If he is strong on anti-racism, announcing an immediate inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence case, it is partly because of his experience at Brentwood school where he became deputy head boy but was bullied. An Aldermaston marcher at 12, a Labour party member by 15, he started on the sensible left as president of Leeds student union and the national union of students. His ambition for political office was whetted on Islington borough council. He gave up the bar to become, at 27, special adviser to Barbara Castle at the Department of Social Security. He also met his wife Alice Perkins during his time there. She was a high flying junior civil servant, and is currently deputy to Richard Wilson, the cabinet secretary. The Straws are the most formidable power couple in Whitehall. His time with Barbara Castle left him not only with a wife but also a deep-rooted Euroscepticism. This continued when she was sacked by James Callaghan in 1976. Mr Straw swiftly became adviser to Peter Shore, the Europhobe environment secretary. With Mr Shore, he helped found the Labour common market safeguards committee, urging withdrawal from the EEC at Labour's 1980 Wembley conference. He was on Mr Shore's leadership campaign team too in 1980 and again in 1983. When Barbara Castle decided to retire from safe Blackburn, she recommended Jack Straw, who had already contested hopeless Tonbridge, as her parliamentary successor, which he became in 1979. His party loyalism is of long standing. He tried to dissuade Tony Benn from contesting the deputy leadership against Denis Healey in 1981. He attacked both the SDP deserters and the radicals who provoked them into deserting. When Militant tried to unseat him at Blackburn, he secured 70% backing for the long procedure to expel the Blackburn Six. After Labour's 1983 defeat he warned that a majority of voters opposed its anti-nuclear defence policies. He later advised that London's loony-left councils were making the party unelectable. As Labour's education spokesman 1987-92, Mr Straw increasingly fought a two-front war against Kenneth Baker and the Tories facing him and against the Bennite hard-left \"flat earthers\" behind him. It was then that he formed an alliance with Gordon Brown and Tony Blair in opposition to a joint slate for the shadow cabinet linking the soft-left Tribune group and the hard-left Campaign group of Tony Benn. As education spokesman, he kept the teachers' unions at arms' length and insisted on frequent testing, high educational standards, quality control and consumer choice. He was, after all, a teacher's son. He was the first in the \"reform Clause IV\" field with his 1993 pamphlet, 'Policy and Ideology', angering Labour's leader, John Smith, who thought it was a dead issue. He also advocated downgrading the monarchy to Scandinavian proportions. When Tony Blair succeeded to the leadership in 1994, he handed over to Jack Straw his portfolio of shadow home secretary. Famously, Mr Straw attacked aggressive beggars and squeegee merchants. But he failed to make an expected triumph over home secretary Michael Howard's sacking of Derek Lewis, the prison services chief, because of Tory heckling and his own tinnitus. To his embarrassment Mr Blair even took to the despatch box to challenge Mr Howard. Yet only months later, Mr Straw was doing Mr Howard's job. He has done it ever since, a reassuring figure in the New Labour pantheon: confident, able and modestly ambitious. These are traits which may yet put him in the running to enter Number 10.

In the Commons he was an assiduous campaigner for his constituency and against Tory \"misdeeds\", such as the attempt of Nicholas Ridley, then environment secretary, to block the building of 1,300 houses on a greenfield site next to his home. He led the motion attacking Robert Maxwell for threatening to dismiss NUJ members at Pergamon Press, whose headquarters were in his constituency. He also signed a 1991 motion opposing war in the Gulf. After backing John Smith for leader in 1992, he became a treasury spokesman under Gordon Brown. By the time Tony Blair became leader two years later, Mr Smith was shadow chief secretary. After the election he had to wait to take this cabinet job, first proving his abilities as minister for employment. Clearly it was thought a more suitable post for a man with a thin piping voice - but it did not stop him entering the cabinet as Gordon Brown's deputy in 1999. Ask Aristotle about Andrew Smith",

      "bodyText": "More than half of the life peers created since 1996 have refused to divulge how much money they have donated to political parties, despite a call for greater transparency by the committee on standards in public life. Labour has promised to deliver more open government but the party's peers were the worst offenders for keeping secret their donations - 65 of 108 either refused or failed to respond to a Guardian survey about party funding by members of the House of Lords. Of the total of 250 life peers asked to complete the recent questionnaire, 92 failed to respond while a further 34 said they did not want to take part; 72 of the peers who did answer said they had given money to a political party and 51 said they had not donated. Across the parties, 55% of Conservatives, 45% of crossbenchers, and 22% of Lib Dem peers, failed to respond to the survey. The results are at odds with a recent report by the committee on standards in public life which said the Lords, as a vital institution in public life and one in which the public and the media were likely to show a growing interest, should adopt greater transparency. The amounts given by the 29 Labour peers who said they had donated ranged from \u00a35 a month by standing order given by Lord Smith of Gilmorehill, to the \u00a32m from Lord Sainsbury, who also promised a further \u00a32m for the election campaign. However, a spokesman for the science minister said that Lord Sainsbury would not reveal how much money he had given in the past. \"Since David became a minister he has declared exactly how much money he has given. Before that he was a private individual and sees no reason to say how much money, or when, he has given to a political party,\" the spokesman said. A number of Labour peers replied that they had refused to respond after taking advice from the Labour whips' office in the Lords. A spokeswoman for Lady Jay, the leader of the Lords, said the government had advised ministers and peers not to respond. \"It is not that they cannot respond, they are advised centrally not to do it,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It is standard practice for all government ministers. Newspapers often use surveys and the standard advice is not to respond. As far as Labour peers go, if they ask for advice - and it is only advice, they can do whatever they want - we would advise them not to take part, as they have no control of the information and can never be sure how it will be used.\" Of the peers who did respond only nine said they had given more than \u00a35,000 to a political party. Lord Bragg, the broadcaster who became a Labour peer in 1998, said he had made two donations of \u00a37,500 in 1997 and a further \u00a37,500 donation in 1999. Lord Paul, the industrialist who joined the Lords in 1996, said that he had given between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000 to Labour every year during the past nine years. The Conservative party treasurer, Lord Ashcroft, who gave \u00a33m in November 1999, responded by saying: \"I appreciate that your letter was something of a standard communication, but I nevertheless enjoyed the novelty of being asked whether I had ever donated money to a political party ... my contributions are disclosed in considerable detail [in the party accounts]. \"I sometimes think it is ironic that I'm criticised for the alleged secrecy of my donations, when in reality I am perhaps the most transparent donor of all.\" The largest Liberal Democrat donor who responded to the survey was the banker Lord Sandberg, who said he and his wife had donated \u00a31,000 a year during the past three years. The most interesting response came from Lord Bell, formerly Lady Thatcher's PR guru, who said: \"When I worked for Thatcher she used to ask whether you would like love or money.

But a spokeswoman insisted that the main aim of the campaign had been to encourage volunteering and gifts in kind. \"It has raised \u00a310,000 in the first four months of a 12-month campaign, which is a lot of money considering it was not meant to be a fundraiser.\" The rough sleepers unit did not disclose yesterday how many people had volunteered - that figure will be revealed later this year - but the spokeswoman said the campaign had been \"inundated\" with offers of help. The posters feature beggars holding signs urging members of the public who \"really want to help\" to call Change A Life. Academics have expressed the fear that stopping giving money to beggars would lead to a rise in crime. In an open letter to Tony Blair, almost 60 social policy experts described the strategy as \"misguided\". Hartley Dean, professor of social policy at Luton University, said: \"I think in the week following Comic Relief there are some comparisons to be drawn. I would want to know what success they have had in terms of attracting volunteers, but in terms of cash donations it doesn't seem to be a proportionate investment. \"It is consistent with the evidence of local 'diverted giving' schemes. There was a scheme in Winchester, where the town council and main shopkeepers decided they didn't want beggars seen around the city centre, which raised quite a lot of money initially and then tapered off quite rapidly.\" The donations will be divided between Crisis, Centrepoint, the Salvation Army and the National Homeless Alliance.",

      "bodyText": "Britain has more towns and cities pumping raw sewage into the sea than any other country in the EU and could face legal action and hefty fines unless it cleans up its act, the European commission warned yesterday. In a report which names and shames 37 towns and cities around Europe which have no provision to treat waste water, the UK, with 11 entries, emerged as the worst polluter in the EU. Only Spain, Portugal and Italy with seven entries apiece come close to matching Britain's tattered green credentials while Ireland and Greece can boast of having just two listings each. Popular seaside resorts such as Brighton and Torbay are named in the report as are more northerly locations such as Dundee, Middlesbrough and Hull. Other areas which Brussels claimed are flouting EU environmental law include Dover, Hastings, Portsmouth, Port Talbot, Bebington and Sunderland. The UK is also the member state with the highest number of towns and cities with \"inadequate facilities\" to treat sewage and again the geographical spread is wide. Britain's nominations for this category range from Aberdeen and Edinburgh in Scotland to Basildon and Canvey Island in Essex and with 22 listings out of a total 72 around Europe, the UK is again the worst polluter. If the government does not take action to remedy the situation soon it may face the humiliating prospect of being taken to the European Court of Justice where it could be ordered to pay a large fine until it falls into line. But local councils and water companies claimed yesterday that the EU report was out of date and unfair. \"This is like Europe ringing up Sunderland football club and suggesting it is about time they got out of Roker Park and built a new football stadium,\" said a spokesman for Northumbria Water. \"We are very disappointed.\" \"In the time it has taken Europe to write this report we have spent \u00a3300m and not only built two treatment plants [for Sunderland and Middlesbrough] but also built four plants in Northumberland, two in Tyne and Wear, two in Durham and three in Cleveland.\" Commission officials admitted that the report represented a snapshot of the situation around Europe at the end of 1998 but argued that little has changed since. \"If they have done a lot in the last two years they should have told us,\" one commission official told the Guardian. However, a spokeswoman for Brighton and Hove city council said the city was \"outraged\" by the report's findings and made it clear that it disputes Brussels's claims that there were serious problems off the coast at Brighton and Hove. Under the EU's urban waste water directive which the UK signed in 1991 all member states were supposed to ensure that towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants had \"a stringent [sewage] collection and treatment system\" in place by the end of 1998. But Colin Rennie, chairman of the North of Scotland Water Authority, responsible for water treatment in Dundee, another city named in the report, said yesterday that several of the problems mentioned were close to being solved. \"It is clearly unacceptable that you can flush your toilet in Dundee and that the contents end up in the river Tay. But the good news is that we are only months away from completing the \u00a3100m Tay waste water project,\" he said. Southern Water also argued that it was working overtime to improve the situation. A new treatment plant had opened at Dover and another was under construction at Hastings. Significantly the report was missing crucial data on the situation in France and Germany but Labour MEP David Bowe said yesterday that Britain still had no grounds for complaint. \"Britain called for offenders to be named and shamed, so we can't complain when we are in the front line.\"",

Labour has promised to deliver more open government but the party's peers were the worst offenders for keeping secret their donations - 65 of 108 either refused or failed to respond to a Guardian survey about party funding by members of the House of Lords. Of the total of 250 life peers asked to complete the recent questionnaire, 92 failed to respond while a further 34 said they did not want to take part; 72 of the peers who did answer said they had given money to a political party and 51 said they had not donated. Across the parties, 55% of Conservatives, 45% of crossbenchers, and 22% of Lib Dem peers, failed to respond to the survey. The results are at odds with a recent report by the committee on standards in public life which said the Lords, as a vital institution in public life and one in which the public and the media were likely to show a growing interest, should adopt greater transparency. The amounts given by the 29 Labour peers who said they had donated ranged from \u00a35 a month by standing order given by Lord Smith of Gilmorehill, to the \u00a32m from Lord Sainsbury, who also promised a further \u00a32m for the election campaign. However, a spokesman for the science minister said that Lord Sainsbury would not reveal how much money he had given in the past. \"Since David became a minister he has declared exactly how much money he has given. Before that he was a private individual and sees no reason to say how much money, or when, he has given to a political party,\" the spokesman said.

Lord Bragg, the broadcaster who became a Labour peer in 1998, said he had made two donations of \u00a37,500 in 1997 and a further \u00a37,500 donation in 1999. Lord Paul, the industrialist who joined the Lords in 1996, said that he had given between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000 to Labour every year during the past nine years. The Conservative party treasurer, Lord Ashcroft, who gave \u00a33m in November 1999, responded by saying: \"I appreciate that your letter was something of a standard communication, but I nevertheless enjoyed the novelty of being asked whether I had ever donated money to a political party ... my contributions are disclosed in considerable detail [in the party accounts]. \"I sometimes think it is ironic that I'm criticised for the alleged secrecy of my donations, when in reality I am perhaps the most transparent donor of all.\" The largest Liberal Democrat donor who responded to the survey was the banker Lord Sandberg, who said he and his wife had donated \u00a31,000 a year during the past three years. The most interesting response came from Lord Bell, formerly Lady Thatcher's PR guru, who said: \"When I worked for Thatcher she used to ask whether you would like love or money. If you said love you got a title and if you said money you got paid.\"",

      "bodyText": "A new row broke out last night over the judgment of Keith Vaz after it was revealed that he had used his position as a government minister to intervene on behalf of a 46-year-old Asian woman taking a sex discrimination case against a firm of City lawyers. The intervention came to light during the Commons inquiry into complaints brought against the Europe minister. Three MPs on the standards and privileges committee were questioning Sarosh Zaiwalla - the City lawyer who was cleared of making large donations to the minister - when he admitted his relations with Mr Vaz were \"very cold\" following the minister's intervention in a private case involving his firm. Mr Zaiwalla told MPs under parliamentary privilege: \"I had formally complained to the cabinet secretary [Sir Richard Wilson] and the prime minister, because one of my staff took my firm to the employment tribunal under the Sex Discrimination Act because she was not given a training contract. \"At the hearing, surprise, surprise, the minister of the crown, Mr Vaz, gave evidence - his statement was read out - that the individual was a very fit individual and if he was in my place he would have given her a training contract. \"She had come from the lord chancellor's department to join my firm as an eight week contract in the hope that she would get a training contract. She did not get it, so she alleged that I had exercised bias in favour of a male white and she oddly went back to the lord chancellor's department. She was an employee of the lord chancellor's department when Mr Vaz was a minister there.\" During the hearing Mr Zaiwala claimed she \"boasted that Gary Hart [Lord Irvine's special adviser] is supporting the proceedings against my firm\". Mr Zaiwalla said he lost the case but has won a right to appeal, after getting a judicial review of the finding in which he had argued that the intervention of the lord chancellor's department had interfered with the balance of the case. He also disclosed that he had discussed the matter with the minister's wife, Maria Fernandes, during an Indo-European Union economic summit in Lisbon - and she told him that the legal assistant did not have Mr Vaz's authority to produce the letter. \"This was a serious matter because that meant that the court had been misled,\" he told MPs. \"After the matter went to the cabinet secretary, Geoffrey Bindman [Mr Vaz's solicitor] wrote to me confirming exactly what Maria had told me: that Mr Vaz had not authorised her to use the copy of the letter for the lord chancellor's file, signed by Mr Vaz.\" The lord chancellor's department said it did not want comment on the case and they say the member of staff is no longer employed there. Last night Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, said: \"This curious case once again questions the judgment of Mr Vaz. He is getting involved in a matter which has clearly nothing to do with his ministerial responsibilities. This is another question that Mr Vaz needs to answer.\" His colleague, Andrew Lansley, last night wrote to the parliamentary commissioner for standards, Elizabeth Filkin, formally complaining that Mrs Vaz had not disclosed his business connections with the Hinduja brothers. Downing Street continued to defend the minister. A spokesman said: \"Keith has made a detailed rebuttal of the allegations as they have come up.\" Useful links Standards and privileges committee report Parliament information on standards Committee on standards in public life Standards and privileges committee MPs' code of conduct, 1996",

      "body": "<p>The Tories today attacked Labour's handling of the foot and mouth crisis as \"grossly inadequate\", with the Conservative leader, William Hague, calling on the government to postpone county council elections in the areas worst hit by the disease.</p> <p>Mr Hague said it was now \"undeniable\" that there could be serious problems in going ahead with elections in counties such as Devon and Cumbria on the scheduled date of May 3.</p> <p>Earlier today, the shadow agriculture minister, Tim Yeo, called for hundreds of troops to be used to bury carcasses and to help arrange a slaughtering programme. Labour has assigned more than 200 army personnel the task of giving advice to farmers on how to dispose of culled animals in Devon and Cumbria.</p> <p>Fifty two-man military teams were starting work at sites across Devon this morning, backed by a 30-strong planning team based in Exeter.</p> <p>Mr Yeo said: \"We have this morning over 60,000 carcasses rotting in open fields and almost 100,000 animals awaiting slaughter, diagnosed as diseased. The government's response is to bring in 50 two-man teams from the army to advise private contractors on how to tackle that backlog. That is a grossly inadequate response.</p> <p>\"We would tell the army to get on with the full task. They must be deployed with all their resources and their logistical skills, the equipment they have got, to start digging graves for those animals on site - on-farm burial,\" he added.</p> <p>Today's attack on Labour's handling of the situation and its election strategy is the clearest signal yet that Mr Hague believes Tony Blair's plans for a general election on May 3 should be halted and the national poll postponed until June or the autumn.

      "bodyText": "The Tories today attacked Labour's handling of the foot and mouth crisis as \"grossly inadequate\", with the Conservative leader, William Hague, calling on the government to postpone county council elections in the areas worst hit by the disease. Mr Hague said it was now \"undeniable\" that there could be serious problems in going ahead with elections in counties such as Devon and Cumbria on the scheduled date of May 3. Earlier today, the shadow agriculture minister, Tim Yeo, called for hundreds of troops to be used to bury carcasses and to help arrange a slaughtering programme. Labour has assigned more than 200 army personnel the task of giving advice to farmers on how to dispose of culled animals in Devon and Cumbria. Fifty two-man military teams were starting work at sites across Devon this morning, backed by a 30-strong planning team based in Exeter. Mr Yeo said: \"We have this morning over 60,000 carcasses rotting in open fields and almost 100,000 animals awaiting slaughter, diagnosed as diseased. The government's response is to bring in 50 two-man teams from the army to advise private contractors on how to tackle that backlog. That is a grossly inadequate response. \"We would tell the army to get on with the full task. They must be deployed with all their resources and their logistical skills, the equipment they have got, to start digging graves for those animals on site - on-farm burial,\" he added. Today's attack on Labour's handling of the situation and its election strategy is the clearest signal yet that Mr Hague believes Tony Blair's plans for a general election on May 3 should be halted and the national poll postponed until June or the autumn. However, a slim majority of voters believe elections should go ahead on May 3 despite the foot and mouth outbreak, according to a poll published today. The NOP poll of 1,000 people taken this weekend found that 47% of those asked agreed with the statement: \"It is important to maintain normal life as far as possible and stick to the timetable to hold elections on May 3.\" But 40% favoured a delay. Half of those surveyed believed the government has taken the right decisions in tackling the crisis, compared to four in 10 (39%) who disagreed.

The timetable for local elections starts running next Monday - March 26. \"I think the government should promote legislation this week to allow council elections in certain counties to be postponed, if appropriate, and to take a decision on that over the next few weeks.\" In Devon, some 16 county council wards have cases of foot and mouth and in half of those the Conservative party candidate is a farmer, said Mr Hague. There is \"a strong and widespread opinion\" in both Devon and Cumbria that action should now be taken to permit the postponement of local elections if it proves necessary, he added. What's going on?

      "body": "<p>It is an open secret that Tony Blair wants to hold the general election on May 3. So when the Sun announced today that polling will indeed take place on May 3 (\"Sun was right all along\") it is behaving in its most comfortable role as propagandist for the winning side.</p> <p>For whenever the election comes, there is little doubt about who will win. All the polls agree that Labour is 15-20% ahead of William Hague's hapless Tories. That is why Mr Hague and his team are gently urging postponement in the national interest; they hope that \"something may turn up\" and save them from their own folly.</p> <p>Like Mr Blair, they solemnly invoke the national interest. Like him they are busy plotting to say dreadful things about the opposing camp when the starting gun is fired. There is an air of quiet desperation among the Tories.</p> <p>It is one more reason why the Sun finally lost patience with the opposition leader over his \"foreign land\" speech this month. Like its proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, in every country he does business, the paper hates a loser.</p> <p>But whether the election takes place on May 3 is still not quite certain. Large parts of the countryside are out of bounds; Europe and many scientists wonder if Whitehall and its vets have got their foot and mouth policy right.</p> <p>Public opinion (can the Sun be far behind?) shows signs of ill-ease that a government with a huge Commons majority - and a year in hand before it has to go to the country - might put its own convenience before the need to get the outbreak, if not under control, then at least on the wane.</p> <p>Lots could happen in the next few days that would make such a decision to go on May 3, local elections, general election and (it gets forgotten) the far more intrusive April 29 census, look shabby, inappropriate even.</p> <p>A bit like taking the kids' nanny on holiday to the Canaries the day after the wife's funeral. Most Britons do not live in the countryside, but they do now grasp the horror afflicting rural dwellers: slaughter of much loved (and valuable) herds, mass burnings, lanes and paths closed, families trapped on farms.</p> <p>That is where the \"inappropriate\" tag comes in. But ministers have a double answer to that. Some 95% of voters live in towns, cities and suburbs. Modern electioneering no longer involves big public meetings, most canvassing is done by phone, not up lanes, and - since this year - most voters can apply for a postal vote (PV) without a special excuse.</p> <p>In other words, logistics are not a problem. The census is trickier because officials must visit every home. Delay would cost \u00a3100m. They will probably get round it.</p> <p>Mr Hague and his ag-spokesman, Tim Yeo, protest that 16 out of 54 counties are affected by foot and mouth. Other local authorities, the British waterways board and the National Trust, have also taken risk-averse decisions and shut down their footpaths. Many of our council candidates are farmers, the Tory leadership adds.</p> <p>At today's 11am Downing Street briefing, reporters were told: \"We will listen to what people have to say. But it is our very, very strong view that it would send the worst signal that Britain is closed for business if we were not to have elections. As we have said throughout, this is a very long haul. Are you suggesting they [the elections] should be postponed for several months?\"</p> <p>That last point, which has taken No 10 some weeks to stumble upon, may be the best argument Mr Blair can deploy, the equivalent of the \"Business as usual\" signs, scrawled in cardboard and pinned to half-destroyed shops during the German blitz on British cities in 1940-41.</p> <p>In other words, tourism, a far bigger industry and export earner than agriculture would suffer even more than it is already suffering if an election postponement was echoed around the world. Ministers are desperately trying to get Britons to start going to the country after weeks when they have patriotically stayed away.</p> <p>What quite they do there is not clear. Not everyone can get to St Austell, where the Eden project - the dome that will really work - opened in foot and mouth-free Cornwall on Saturday. Pubs? Restaurants? A bracing walk around the car park? In many parts these are the only options still open.</p> <p>Mr Blair says \"Instead of Don't Go Unless, Do Go Unless\" - hardly a snappy slogan, and the admen about to be employed will do better. Meanwhile the country industries are losing \u00a3100m a week as Easter and even summer cancellations proliferate.</p> <p>The loss of foreign visitors, their dollars, francs and yen, would be even more grievous. A silent spring indeed. As with so much of this crisis it throws into acute relief deep questions about how we view our countryside and what it is for. Those questions will have to wait.</p> <p>So - for a few days at least - should tactical questions about the election. By all means let Millbank planners and their rivals in Tory central office work on the schedules they have polished for months - and for May 3. But the polls suggest that voters would like their government to concentrate on foot and mouth this week.</p> <p>They may be set to re-elect New Labour - they are. But the public mood is volatile. Voters do not love the government so much that they will overlook selfish opportunism if that if how they judge it.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,457805,00.html \">16.03.2001: Waiting and watching and hoping</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,451194,00.html\">'The town is uncannily quiet</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html \">05.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

But it is our very, very strong view that it would send the worst signal that Britain is closed for business if we were not to have elections. As we have said throughout, this is a very long haul. Are you suggesting they [the elections] should be postponed for several months?\" That last point, which has taken No 10 some weeks to stumble upon, may be the best argument Mr Blair can deploy, the equivalent of the \"Business as usual\" signs, scrawled in cardboard and pinned to half-destroyed shops during the German blitz on British cities in 1940-41. In other words, tourism, a far bigger industry and export earner than agriculture would suffer even more than it is already suffering if an election postponement was echoed around the world. Ministers are desperately trying to get Britons to start going to the country after weeks when they have patriotically stayed away. What quite they do there is not clear. Not everyone can get to St Austell, where the Eden project - the dome that will really work - opened in foot and mouth-free Cornwall on Saturday. Pubs? Restaurants? A bracing walk around the car park? In many parts these are the only options still open. Mr Blair says \"Instead of Don't Go Unless, Do Go Unless\" - hardly a snappy slogan, and the admen about to be employed will do better. Meanwhile the country industries are losing \u00a3100m a week as Easter and even summer cancellations proliferate. The loss of foreign visitors, their dollars, francs and yen, would be even more grievous. A silent spring indeed. As with so much of this crisis it throws into acute relief deep questions about how we view our countryside and what it is for. Those questions will have to wait. So - for a few days at least - should tactical questions about the election. By all means let Millbank planners and their rivals in Tory central office work on the schedules they have polished for months - and for May 3. But the polls suggest that voters would like their government to concentrate on foot and mouth this week. They may be set to re-elect New Labour - they are. But the public mood is volatile. Voters do not love the government so much that they will overlook selfish opportunism if that if how they judge it. What's going on?

The fallout from the row - which centres on a \u00a3200,000 payment which Mr Robinson insists he never received - has also led the trade secretary, Stephen Byers, to threaten to sue the Daily Mail. The claim that he did take the money is made in a new book about Mr Robinson, now the MP for Coventry North West, by investigative journalist Tom Bower. Today the Tories will ask the Commons standard and privileges commissioner Elizabeth Filkin to investigate the reports, and Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker is to table detailed parliamentary questions about the affair. Yesterday Mr Byers took the unprecedented step of threatening to sue the Daily Mail over an allegation that, while he was trade secretary, he \"buried\" an official report into the business affairs of the former paymaster general, who resigned in 1998 over his home loan to Peter Mandelson. It would make legal and political history for a current cabinet minister to appear in court over a libel action. Today the paper said it was \"100%\" confident of its story - and stepped up its attack, claiming the chancellor, Gordon Brown, pressured a civil servant into calling an offshore tax haven a \"family trust.\" The Treasury permanent secretary Sir Terry Burns refused to do so.

      "body": "<p>Three great questions now confront the Labour party. Assuming it wins the election in a few weeks time, can it finally break the umbilical cord of privilege, snobbery and inertia which has tied the British state to the Conservative party for more than 100 years? Can it develop a coherent social-democratic governing philosophy, capable of guiding it through the inevitable uncertainties and contingencies of government? Can it revive our battered, resource-starved public services, and breathe new life into the ethic of citizenship and service which is fundamental to the public realm?</p> <p>The third question holds the key to the first two. A substantial election victory in May is a precondition of the progressive century of Blair's dreams, but his real test will come after polling day. He has been astonishingly successful in marginalising the Conservative party, but the job is not yet done. The forces which have produced Sharon in Israel, Haider in Austria, Berlusconi in Italy and George Bush in the US have equivalents in Britain. The threat of a hard-right resurgence will not disappear until social-democratic norms permeate the public culture and the structures of the state. In his first term Blair established a bridgehead - the beginnings of a constitutional revolution; normalisation of relations with the rest of the EU; modest, but real, fiscal redistribution. It is time to follow the bridgehead with a breakthrough.</p> <p>One of the crucial objectives of such a breakthrough would be the renewal of the public services and the culture that sustains them. Social democracy and the public realm are inextricably intertwined. Without an ideologically confident and politically effective social-democratic movement to champion them, the public services are always at risk. Without a vibrant public realm, ring-fenced from the market realm, social-democratic politics cannot flourish. Public services depend on a culture of citizenship and equity - on a culture in which professional pride in a job well done or a sense of civic duty or a mixture of both replace the hope of gain and the fear of loss as spurs to action. And that is pre-eminently the culture of social democracy.</p> <p>It is now dangerously attenuated. The single most important element in the New Right project of the 1980s and 90s was a relentless Kulturkampf designed to root it out. Deregulation, privatisation, so-called public-private partnerships, proxy markets, performance indicators mimicking those of corporate management and a systematic assault on professional autonomy narrowed the public realm and blurred the distinction between it and the market realm. Public functions of all kinds were farmed out to unaccountable appointed bodies, dominated by business interests and managed according to market principles. Intermediate institutions like the BBC, the universities, the schools, museums and the health service were forced, so far as possible, into a market mould. So was the senior civil service, where the frontiers of the public realm had been most zealously guarded, and in which its values had been most thoroughly internalised.</p> <p>The tatty, shabby, over-stretched public services of 21st century Britain are the most obvious legacy of this Kulturkampf, but they are not the most dangerous one. Incessant marketisation has done even more damage than low taxation and resource starvation. It has generated a culture of distrust, which is nibbling away at the values of professionalism, citizenship, equity and service like an acrid fog. For the marketisers, the professional, public service ethic is a con. Professionals are self-interested rent-seekers, trying to force the price of their labour above its market value. The service ethic is a device to legitimise a web of monopolistic cartels whose real purpose is to rip off the consumer. There is no point in appealing to the values of common citizenship. There are no citizens; there are only customers. Public servants are inherently untrustworthy. If they are allowed autonomy, they will abuse it. Like everyone else, they can be motivated only by sticks and carrots. If possible, privatisation must expose them to the sticks and carrots of market competition. If not, they must be kept on their toes by repeated audits, assessments and appraisals.</p> <p>Twenty years of this mean-spirited rhetoric have demoralised the public services and encouraged users who can afford it to buy their way out. The service ethic still has devoted champions among doctors, teachers, nurses, social workers, academics, broadcasters, judges, trade-union officials, local government officials and NGO workers. But danger signs are everywhere. The most spectacular have appeared in Whitehall itself. First the Scott report and then the Phillips report showed that the culture of disinterested professionalism, which held that the civil servant's duty was to serve the public interest and tell truth to power, is in tatters.</p> <p>And that is only the beginning. The growing interpenetration of the worlds of politics and business; the sleaze which has accompanied it; the dumbing down of the BBC; the sponsorship culture which has invaded virtually every form of public entertainment from opera to football; the diversion of academic energies from the pursuit of knowledge and the education of the young to a desperate scrabbling for advantage in mindless assessment exercises; all tell the same story. They all show that the dykes which our Victorian ancestors built to protect the public realm from the encroaching imperialism of the market realm have been breached repeatedly.</p> <p>Few social democrats would disagree with that, but the implications are more contentious than appears at first sight. The public realm cannot be resuscitated by ministerial fiat or bureaucratic intervention, no matter how well-intentioned. The service ethic is hollow without a supporting ethic of democracy and diversity. Marketisation made headway because it spoke to a widespread popular revolt against the condescension and exclusiveness of the elites that used to manage the public services, and to a well-founded popular demand for accountability. The accountability it offered was deformed and corrosive. But that does not imply a return to the public realm of the old days. Accountability should be sought through participation, openness and a willingness to listen, not the price mechanism or the iron cage of bureaucratic audit. The social democracy of the 21st century must recover the decentralist, participatory strands in its own tradition, and marry them with the equivalent strands in the social liberal tradition.</p> <p>Top-down, central-state social democracy is a busted flush. It runs against the grain of the information age, and flies in the face of the cultural revolution of the last 35 years. Politely, but firmly, it should be junked. This is exactly what Tony Blair promised in his early days as Labour leader. Keynes, Beveridge and Lloyd George, he repeatedly insisted, were as much at home in the New Labour pantheon as Attlee, Bevin or Bevan. He picked up the mantle of constitutional reform and political decentralisation where the Asquith government had dropped it in 1914. The result was an astonishingly far-reaching transfer of power from the central state to lower tiers of government. Then the centralist, metropolitan side of the social-democratic tradition reasserted itself, and the revolution stalled. It is time to get back on track.</p> <p>\u0095 David Marquand is the principal of Mansfield College, Oxford, a former Labour politician and a founder member of the Social Democratic party.</p>",

Assuming it wins the election in a few weeks time, can it finally break the umbilical cord of privilege, snobbery and inertia which has tied the British state to the Conservative party for more than 100 years? Can it develop a coherent social-democratic governing philosophy, capable of guiding it through the inevitable uncertainties and contingencies of government? Can it revive our battered, resource-starved public services, and breathe new life into the ethic of citizenship and service which is fundamental to the public realm? The third question holds the key to the first two. A substantial election victory in May is a precondition of the progressive century of Blair's dreams, but his real test will come after polling day. He has been astonishingly successful in marginalising the Conservative party, but the job is not yet done. The forces which have produced Sharon in Israel, Haider in Austria, Berlusconi in Italy and George Bush in the US have equivalents in Britain. The threat of a hard-right resurgence will not disappear until social-democratic norms permeate the public culture and the structures of the state. In his first term Blair established a bridgehead - the beginnings of a constitutional revolution; normalisation of relations with the rest of the EU; modest, but real, fiscal redistribution. It is time to follow the bridgehead with a breakthrough. One of the crucial objectives of such a breakthrough would be the renewal of the public services and the culture that sustains them. Social democracy and the public realm are inextricably intertwined. Without an ideologically confident and politically effective social-democratic movement to champion them, the public services are always at risk. Without a vibrant public realm, ring-fenced from the market realm, social-democratic politics cannot flourish. Public services depend on a culture of citizenship and equity - on a culture in which professional pride in a job well done or a sense of civic duty or a mixture of both replace the hope of gain and the fear of loss as spurs to action. And that is pre-eminently the culture of social democracy. It is now dangerously attenuated. The single most important element in the New Right project of the 1980s and 90s was a relentless Kulturkampf designed to root it out. Deregulation, privatisation, so-called public-private partnerships, proxy markets, performance indicators mimicking those of corporate management and a systematic assault on professional autonomy narrowed the public realm and blurred the distinction between it and the market realm. Public functions of all kinds were farmed out to unaccountable appointed bodies, dominated by business interests and managed according to market principles. Intermediate institutions like the BBC, the universities, the schools, museums and the health service were forced, so far as possible, into a market mould. So was the senior civil service, where the frontiers of the public realm had been most zealously guarded, and in which its values had been most thoroughly internalised. The tatty, shabby, over-stretched public services of 21st century Britain are the most obvious legacy of this Kulturkampf, but they are not the most dangerous one. Incessant marketisation has done even more damage than low taxation and resource starvation. It has generated a culture of distrust, which is nibbling away at the values of professionalism, citizenship, equity and service like an acrid fog. For the marketisers, the professional, public service ethic is a con. Professionals are self-interested rent-seekers, trying to force the price of their labour above its market value. The service ethic is a device to legitimise a web of monopolistic cartels whose real purpose is to rip off the consumer. There is no point in appealing to the values of common citizenship. There are no citizens; there are only customers. Public servants are inherently untrustworthy. If they are allowed autonomy, they will abuse it. Like everyone else, they can be motivated only by sticks and carrots. If possible, privatisation must expose them to the sticks and carrots of market competition. If not, they must be kept on their toes by repeated audits, assessments and appraisals. Twenty years of this mean-spirited rhetoric have demoralised the public services and encouraged users who can afford it to buy their way out. The service ethic still has devoted champions among doctors, teachers, nurses, social workers, academics, broadcasters, judges, trade-union officials, local government officials and NGO workers. But danger signs are everywhere. The most spectacular have appeared in Whitehall itself. First the Scott report and then the Phillips report showed that the culture of disinterested professionalism, which held that the civil servant's duty was to serve the public interest and tell truth to power, is in tatters. And that is only the beginning. The growing interpenetration of the worlds of politics and business; the sleaze which has accompanied it; the dumbing down of the BBC; the sponsorship culture which has invaded virtually every form of public entertainment from opera to football; the diversion of academic energies from the pursuit of knowledge and the education of the young to a desperate scrabbling for advantage in mindless assessment exercises; all tell the same story. They all show that the dykes which our Victorian ancestors built to protect the public realm from the encroaching imperialism of the market realm have been breached repeatedly. Few social democrats would disagree with that, but the implications are more contentious than appears at first sight. The public realm cannot be resuscitated by ministerial fiat or bureaucratic intervention, no matter how well-intentioned. The service ethic is hollow without a supporting ethic of democracy and diversity. Marketisation made headway because it spoke to a widespread popular revolt against the condescension and exclusiveness of the elites that used to manage the public services, and to a well-founded popular demand for accountability. The accountability it offered was deformed and corrosive. But that does not imply a return to the public realm of the old days. Accountability should be sought through participation, openness and a willingness to listen, not the price mechanism or the iron cage of bureaucratic audit. The social democracy of the 21st century must recover the decentralist, participatory strands in its own tradition, and marry them with the equivalent strands in the social liberal tradition. Top-down, central-state social democracy is a busted flush. It runs against the grain of the information age, and flies in the face of the cultural revolution of the last 35 years. Politely, but firmly, it should be junked. This is exactly what Tony Blair promised in his early days as Labour leader. Keynes, Beveridge and Lloyd George, he repeatedly insisted, were as much at home in the New Labour pantheon as Attlee, Bevin or Bevan. He picked up the mantle of constitutional reform and political decentralisation where the Asquith government had dropped it in 1914. The result was an astonishingly far-reaching transfer of power from the central state to lower tiers of government. Then the centralist, metropolitan side of the social-democratic tradition reasserted itself, and the revolution stalled. It is time to get back on track. \u0095 David Marquand is the principal of Mansfield College, Oxford, a former Labour politician and a founder member of the Social Democratic party.",

      "body": "<p>Anthony Storr, who has died of a heart attack aged 80, was Britain's most literate psychiatrist. A prolific author, journalist and radio and television commentator, he was widely respected as a fount of wisdom and good sense in a profession not particularly noted for such qualities. Like other kind and compassionate men, he was no stranger to suffering at formative stages of his life.</p> <p>Born in London, Storr was a solitary, friendless child, plagued by frequent illness, including severe asthma and septicaemia, from which he nearly died. He was the youngest of four children, separated by 10 years from his closest sibling. His father, Vernon Faithfull Storr, sub-dean of Westminster Abbey, was 51 when Anthony was born, and his mother, Katherine Cecilia Storr, was 44. They were first cousins, and their consanguinity probably accounted for his asthma, from which he, like two of his siblings, suffered for most of his life. He also seems to have inherited from his mother a tendency to occasional episodes of depression.</p> <p>Growing up in the privileged seclusion of Dean's Yard, Westminster, as virtually an only child, Storr was particularly affected by the trauma, shared by most boys of his class and time, of being sent away to a boarding prep school at the age of eight. There, and later at Winchester College, he was bitterly unhappy.</p> <p>Having been deprived of a childhood peer group in which to learn the skills of comradeship, he was ill-prepared for the rigours of boarding-school life. Extremely slow to make friends, and showing little proficiency for games, he was bullied, and made only average academic progress. Though utterly miserable, it never occurred to him to complain to his parents, or attempt to run away, because boarding school was then a fact of life.

From an early age, he attended performances in Westminster Abbey of such works as Bach's St Matthew Passion, and was later allowed to sit in the organ loft, an enormous thrill.</p> <p>At Winchester, he sang in the choir, played the viola in the orchestra and piano solos in concerts. He always maintained that he would much rather have been a professional musician than a psychiatrist or writer, had he been blessed with the necessary talent and training; he freely acknowledged that his friendship with artists of the calibre of Alfred Brendel, and the musicologist Hans Keller, meant far more than would have equivalent friendships with Freud, Jung or Adler.</p> <p>Storr's decision to become a psychiatrist was made soon after he went up to Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1939.

I had disappointed my parents and teachers by not doing nearly as well as I should have. When I told Snow tentatively that I might go into psychiatry, he said, 'I think you'd be very good at it.' It was a ridiculous thing to decide one's future on a chance comment like that. The crucial thing was that he liked me, and thought I could do it.\"</p> <p>After two years at Cambridge, Storr was given a wartime courtesy degree without taking a tripos, and continued his medical studies at Westminster hospital (1941-44), where he won prizes for medicine and surgery.

      "bodyText": "Anthony Storr, who has died of a heart attack aged 80, was Britain's most literate psychiatrist. A prolific author, journalist and radio and television commentator, he was widely respected as a fount of wisdom and good sense in a profession not particularly noted for such qualities. Like other kind and compassionate men, he was no stranger to suffering at formative stages of his life. Born in London, Storr was a solitary, friendless child, plagued by frequent illness, including severe asthma and septicaemia, from which he nearly died. He was the youngest of four children, separated by 10 years from his closest sibling. His father, Vernon Faithfull Storr, sub-dean of Westminster Abbey, was 51 when Anthony was born, and his mother, Katherine Cecilia Storr, was 44. They were first cousins, and their consanguinity probably accounted for his asthma, from which he, like two of his siblings, suffered for most of his life. He also seems to have inherited from his mother a tendency to occasional episodes of depression. Growing up in the privileged seclusion of Dean's Yard, Westminster, as virtually an only child, Storr was particularly affected by the trauma, shared by most boys of his class and time, of being sent away to a boarding prep school at the age of eight. There, and later at Winchester College, he was bitterly unhappy. Having been deprived of a childhood peer group in which to learn the skills of comradeship, he was ill-prepared for the rigours of boarding-school life. Extremely slow to make friends, and showing little proficiency for games, he was bullied, and made only average academic progress. Though utterly miserable, it never occurred to him to complain to his parents, or attempt to run away, because boarding school was then a fact of life. But the sense of being a loner never left him, and was to affect the course of his career, as well as the content of his books. What preserved his sanity and emotional equilibrium was a growing passion for music. From an early age, he attended performances in Westminster Abbey of such works as Bach's St Matthew Passion, and was later allowed to sit in the organ loft, an enormous thrill. At Winchester, he sang in the choir, played the viola in the orchestra and piano solos in concerts. He always maintained that he would much rather have been a professional musician than a psychiatrist or writer, had he been blessed with the necessary talent and training; he freely acknowledged that his friendship with artists of the calibre of Alfred Brendel, and the musicologist Hans Keller, meant far more than would have equivalent friendships with Freud, Jung or Adler. Storr's decision to become a psychiatrist was made soon after he went up to Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1939. His moral tutor was CP Snow, who became a lifelong friend. \"I owed him a tremendous debt,\" Storr told me. \"He was the first person who made me feel I might be any good at anything.

      "body": "<p> The current euro buzz phrase is \"language friendly\" - and the UK is plugging it for all it's worth. From sending Welsh rock singers to Alexandria or Gaelic musicians to Rome, to last week's showcase conference for Italian teachers of English in Venice, the British Council is doing its best to present us as multilingual.</p> <p>While Brits are seen abroad as hopeless at languages, and while university language departments in the UK are talking of Armageddon because so few students are coming through school with the necessary language A-levels and highers, the council is factually correct to point out that there are lots of languages spoken within these shores.</p> <p>In its The Power of Babel exhibition, the British Council declares: \"Contrary to popular belief, the UK has always been multilingual. Gaelic, Irish and Welsh have been gradually displaced by English, itself the product of many different influences, but today they are fighting back. The older mother tongues have been joined by an astonishing variety of more recently arrived languages from all parts of the world.\"</p> <p>Slightly bemused Italian teachers were treated to posters of Scots verse - like Robert Garioch's take on a Greek legend: \"Bumpity doon in the corrie gaed whuddran the pitiless whun stane/Sisyphus dodderin efter it.\"</p> <p>The Babel exhibition occupies a corner of the large cinema where the conference was held, and was overwhelmed by the array of publishers selling books and course materials in one language only. Behind the nod to preserving minority languages, it was business as usual for English. For English is big business. The British Council says the UK enjoys the biggest share of the international education market. The US may enrol more international students in its universities, but worldwide the UK attracts more students and trainees.</p> <p>The 218,823 overseas students enrolled at British universities at the last count (in 1999/2000) are only the vanguard of a 2m-strong army of foreign nationals who are taught and sit exams for British academic, vocational and linguistic qualifications in their own countries. At a very conservative estimate, universities are boosting UK exports by more than \u00a32.6bn a year just from the students who come here - and by and large they don't come here to learn Gaelic. Everyone, it seems, wants to learn English for reasons that have far more to do with the global dominance of the American economy than a thirst for the culture of Britain. It is a sign of the times that Sardinia, traditionally seen as a land of shepherds speaking a dialect linked to Latin, should be asking the British Council's help for a massive effort in boosting English on the island. It is an economic imperative.</p> <p>Some of the tensions generated by the steamroller of English were apparent in Venice. French and German speakers seemed defensive: English wasn't the only foreign language Italians should learn. There were a lot of references to the EU's European Year of Languages and its stress on linguistic diversity.</p> <p>The competition is sharpened by Italy's ambitious drive to boost modern languages in its schools from the age of six. Until this year, a second language was introduced at eight. Under Progetto Lingue 2000 this is being done earlier (many nursery schools now introduce a second language), while a third language istaught from 11 upwards. The aim is for most students to take at least one foreign language to 18.</p> <p>Schools are free to choose from French, German, Spanish or English, but 80% are opting for English, and signals from the education ministry are that this must be one of the two languages taught. The project has entailed a huge training effort to get teachers' languages up to speed. Italian schools are going through the sort of upheaval experienced in England in the 1980s with the national curriculum, aimed at improving continuity in primary and secondary schooling and sorting out what is essential for children to be taught. One effect of the changes has been to make more room for languages in the curriculum.</p> <p>Given the export opportunities for English, should the British Council be spending taxpayers' money staging Gaelic and Welsh concerts in Rome? The Welsh band Rag Foundation recently performed in Alexandria with the Egyptian pop and movie star Mohamed Mounir, who also sings in the minority tongue of Nubian, while Scots musicians working in Lallans and Gaelic have been to perform in Uganda and Kazakhstan.</p> <p>Emphatically yes, says Dick Alford, director of the British Council in Italy: \"We don't want to ram English down people's throats. We want to promote it and the exporters who benefit from it economically, but we want to approach the whole issue in a broadminded way.\" </p> <p>Britain's experience of immigration and how to absorb children who speak another mother tongue into the education system - a theme of the Babel exhibition - is particularly relevant in Italy at the moment, Alford points out: \"We can do both and be much more effective in plugging English if we don't just bang away.\" </p> <p>While 17% of Italian visitors come to Britain to learn the language, exchanging ideas and knowledge about the success of minority languages and culture will also make it a more attractive holiday destination, he argues. (The website of the exhibition, researched by Professor Viv Edwards of Reading University, is refreshingly frank about the fact that language-teaching provision in UK schools compares unfavourably with other European countries. \"It is not widely available and not a popular option, especially with boys,\" it states. \"Official policy has been contradictory. On the one hand there was widespread agreement on the need for speakers of Japanese, Chinese and other Asian languages; on the other hand it was not considered cost-effective to provide teaching in these languages for pupils of compulsory school age.</p> <p>So the council is giving enthusiastic backing to a \"language passport\" devised by the Council of Europe, the body of 43 member states covering eastern and western Europe. Unveiled at the conference, the European Language Portfolio allows people to record what level they have reached in different languages. Designed initially for adults and students over 16, the passport is based on self-assessment using \"can do\" statements covering listening, reading, speaking and writing. (The French have produced an attractive version for children.)</p> <p>When it comes to speaking, these range from A1 (\"I can interact in a simple way provided the other person is prepared to repeat or rephrase things at a slower rate\") to C2 (\"I can take part effortlessly in any conversation or discussion and have a good familiarity with idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms.\")</p> <p>Johanna Panthier, head of the Council of Europe's languages division, said the aim was that all citizens could use the passport, although there must be no compulsion. In some countries, such as Hungary, she said, the government was producing and distributing the passports. In the UK it will be done by the Centre for Information on Language Teaching (CILT). How the passport goes down in multilingual Britain, or whether Brits continue to travel in the expectation of being understood wherever they go, remains to be seen.</p> <p>The British Council is also taking part in the Casanova project [Casanova is now seen as a good European traveller], \"an online game for children in which they visit websites in Italian, French, German, Spanish and English\".</p> <p>Of course, the English that is conquering the world is a utilitarian version. Professor Paolo Balboni, of the University of Venice, told the conference that English had become the lingua franca of the world: \"Although this may be a victory for the language, it is a defeat for British and American culture. The world is content with a simplified version of the language. Native English speakers who want to be understood at conferences, negotiations and so on have to undergo specific training.\"</p> <p>Professor Ron Carter, of Nottingham University, believes that English language teaching abroad is affecting how literature and language are taught in British schools.

      "bodyText": "The current euro buzz phrase is \"language friendly\" - and the UK is plugging it for all it's worth. From sending Welsh rock singers to Alexandria or Gaelic musicians to Rome, to last week's showcase conference for Italian teachers of English in Venice, the British Council is doing its best to present us as multilingual. While Brits are seen abroad as hopeless at languages, and while university language departments in the UK are talking of Armageddon because so few students are coming through school with the necessary language A-levels and highers, the council is factually correct to point out that there are lots of languages spoken within these shores. In its The Power of Babel exhibition, the British Council declares: \"Contrary to popular belief, the UK has always been multilingual. Gaelic, Irish and Welsh have been gradually displaced by English, itself the product of many different influences, but today they are fighting back. The older mother tongues have been joined by an astonishing variety of more recently arrived languages from all parts of the world.\" Slightly bemused Italian teachers were treated to posters of Scots verse - like Robert Garioch's take on a Greek legend: \"Bumpity doon in the corrie gaed whuddran the pitiless whun stane/Sisyphus dodderin efter it.\" The Babel exhibition occupies a corner of the large cinema where the conference was held, and was overwhelmed by the array of publishers selling books and course materials in one language only. Behind the nod to preserving minority languages, it was business as usual for English. For English is big business. The British Council says the UK enjoys the biggest share of the international education market. The US may enrol more international students in its universities, but worldwide the UK attracts more students and trainees. The 218,823 overseas students enrolled at British universities at the last count (in 1999/2000) are only the vanguard of a 2m-strong army of foreign nationals who are taught and sit exams for British academic, vocational and linguistic qualifications in their own countries. At a very conservative estimate, universities are boosting UK exports by more than \u00a32.6bn a year just from the students who come here - and by and large they don't come here to learn Gaelic. Everyone, it seems, wants to learn English for reasons that have far more to do with the global dominance of the American economy than a thirst for the culture of Britain. It is a sign of the times that Sardinia, traditionally seen as a land of shepherds speaking a dialect linked to Latin, should be asking the British Council's help for a massive effort in boosting English on the island. It is an economic imperative. Some of the tensions generated by the steamroller of English were apparent in Venice. French and German speakers seemed defensive: English wasn't the only foreign language Italians should learn. There were a lot of references to the EU's European Year of Languages and its stress on linguistic diversity. The competition is sharpened by Italy's ambitious drive to boost modern languages in its schools from the age of six. Until this year, a second language was introduced at eight. Under Progetto Lingue 2000 this is being done earlier (many nursery schools now introduce a second language), while a third language istaught from 11 upwards. The aim is for most students to take at least one foreign language to 18. Schools are free to choose from French, German, Spanish or English, but 80% are opting for English, and signals from the education ministry are that this must be one of the two languages taught. The project has entailed a huge training effort to get teachers' languages up to speed. Italian schools are going through the sort of upheaval experienced in England in the 1980s with the national curriculum, aimed at improving continuity in primary and secondary schooling and sorting out what is essential for children to be taught. One effect of the changes has been to make more room for languages in the curriculum. Given the export opportunities for English, should the British Council be spending taxpayers' money staging Gaelic and Welsh concerts in Rome? The Welsh band Rag Foundation recently performed in Alexandria with the Egyptian pop and movie star Mohamed Mounir, who also sings in the minority tongue of Nubian, while Scots musicians working in Lallans and Gaelic have been to perform in Uganda and Kazakhstan. Emphatically yes, says Dick Alford, director of the British Council in Italy: \"We don't want to ram English down people's throats. We want to promote it and the exporters who benefit from it economically, but we want to approach the whole issue in a broadminded way.\" Britain's experience of immigration and how to absorb children who speak another mother tongue into the education system - a theme of the Babel exhibition - is particularly relevant in Italy at the moment, Alford points out: \"We can do both and be much more effective in plugging English if we don't just bang away.\" While 17% of Italian visitors come to Britain to learn the language, exchanging ideas and knowledge about the success of minority languages and culture will also make it a more attractive holiday destination, he argues. (The website of the exhibition, researched by Professor Viv Edwards of Reading University, is refreshingly frank about the fact that language-teaching provision in UK schools compares unfavourably with other European countries. \"It is not widely available and not a popular option, especially with boys,\" it states. \"Official policy has been contradictory. On the one hand there was widespread agreement on the need for speakers of Japanese, Chinese and other Asian languages; on the other hand it was not considered cost-effective to provide teaching in these languages for pupils of compulsory school age. So the council is giving enthusiastic backing to a \"language passport\" devised by the Council of Europe, the body of 43 member states covering eastern and western Europe. Unveiled at the conference, the European Language Portfolio allows people to record what level they have reached in different languages. Designed initially for adults and students over 16, the passport is based on self-assessment using \"can do\" statements covering listening, reading, speaking and writing. (The French have produced an attractive version for children.) When it comes to speaking, these range from A1 (\"I can interact in a simple way provided the other person is prepared to repeat or rephrase things at a slower rate\") to C2 (\"I can take part effortlessly in any conversation or discussion and have a good familiarity with idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms.\") Johanna Panthier, head of the Council of Europe's languages division, said the aim was that all citizens could use the passport, although there must be no compulsion. In some countries, such as Hungary, she said, the government was producing and distributing the passports. In the UK it will be done by the Centre for Information on Language Teaching (CILT). How the passport goes down in multilingual Britain, or whether Brits continue to travel in the expectation of being understood wherever they go, remains to be seen. The British Council is also taking part in the Casanova project [Casanova is now seen as a good European traveller], \"an online game for children in which they visit websites in Italian, French, German, Spanish and English\". Of course, the English that is conquering the world is a utilitarian version. Professor Paolo Balboni, of the University of Venice, told the conference that English had become the lingua franca of the world: \"Although this may be a victory for the language, it is a defeat for British and American culture. The world is content with a simplified version of the language. Native English speakers who want to be understood at conferences, negotiations and so on have to undergo specific training.\" Professor Ron Carter, of Nottingham University, believes that English language teaching abroad is affecting how literature and language are taught in British schools. His report on grammar for the Conservative government was suppressed by ministers - it was not the back to basics they wanted. Since then, its ideas \"have lead a samizdat existence abroad\". His approach is to look at language in context - \"which is how English tends to be taught abroad. I think we can learn from each other. Standards of literature teaching in Britain are very good at GCSE and A-level, but there is quite a lot English teachers in Britain could learn from English language teaching abroad.\" Meanwhile there is business to be done. Italy is a good market for UK publishers, enthuses Nick Beer, who is in Venice as academic manager of Penguin Italia: \"The Italians are not the most fantastic language learners, so you can sell books to the same people four or five times in a lifetime - at school, university, private language school and post-retirement courses.

      "body": "<p>What are universities really like? Having spent around 45 seconds talking to a university rep at a busy higher education fair and stared for considerably longer at very large reference books, glossy prospectuses and impenetrable websites, this question remains uppermost in your mind. </p> <p>There really is no substitute for The Visit. Seeing your likely choices of university is an important part of the whole process. Whilst visiting many is probably impossible from both a time and a money perspective, spending a day at a few is much more realistic and will undoubtedly help your decision-making later. </p> <p>The new post-16 curriculum, embarked upon by year 12 students last September, has encouraged some changes in the pattern of open-day visits. Many universities have realised that students, heavily timetabled with AS lessons throughout the year, will also be involved in AS exams in May and June, the \"peak season\" in the past for such open days. As a result some have moved these events forward to March or back to September and October, while others have given birth to the Saturday open day. Despite the changes, the best advice remains the same: try and visit at least a couple of universities in this way. </p> <p>But where to go? If you already have some strong choices in mind, then no problem. If you are undecided then the best idea is to get a snapshot of what's available. This could involve seeing one close to home, another in a city centre and one at a single-site campus. Travel time and distance from home could be considerations for you. Do you want to be at a large or small institution, new or old? </p> <p>Your school or college may well be organising visits to open days, but you can make your own arrangements. The UCAS reference book on open days (see below) gives dates and contact details. </p> <p>Before the actual day, spend some time thinking about what you want to get out of the day - otherwise you'll return none the wiser. You'll want to know more about your chosen course in terms of content, teaching and assessment. What are the AS- and A-level entrance requirements? Try and talk to current students if possible - they'll give you the low-down on accommodation, workload and student life in general. Any subject talks will give an idea of what your lectures may be like. At the end of the day you will almost certainly have a gut feeling, an overall impression of the place. With over 300 institutions to choose from, an objective decision is a near-impossibility, but a few visits will give you a much better idea. </p> <p>All the signs are that universities continue to set great store by these open days.

      "bodyText": "What are universities really like? Having spent around 45 seconds talking to a university rep at a busy higher education fair and stared for considerably longer at very large reference books, glossy prospectuses and impenetrable websites, this question remains uppermost in your mind. There really is no substitute for The Visit. Seeing your likely choices of university is an important part of the whole process. Whilst visiting many is probably impossible from both a time and a money perspective, spending a day at a few is much more realistic and will undoubtedly help your decision-making later. The new post-16 curriculum, embarked upon by year 12 students last September, has encouraged some changes in the pattern of open-day visits. Many universities have realised that students, heavily timetabled with AS lessons throughout the year, will also be involved in AS exams in May and June, the \"peak season\" in the past for such open days. As a result some have moved these events forward to March or back to September and October, while others have given birth to the Saturday open day. Despite the changes, the best advice remains the same: try and visit at least a couple of universities in this way. But where to go? If you already have some strong choices in mind, then no problem. If you are undecided then the best idea is to get a snapshot of what's available. This could involve seeing one close to home, another in a city centre and one at a single-site campus. Travel time and distance from home could be considerations for you. Do you want to be at a large or small institution, new or old? Your school or college may well be organising visits to open days, but you can make your own arrangements. The UCAS reference book on open days (see below) gives dates and contact details. Before the actual day, spend some time thinking about what you want to get out of the day - otherwise you'll return none the wiser. You'll want to know more about your chosen course in terms of content, teaching and assessment. What are the AS- and A-level entrance requirements? Try and talk to current students if possible - they'll give you the low-down on accommodation, workload and student life in general. Any subject talks will give an idea of what your lectures may be like. At the end of the day you will almost certainly have a gut feeling, an overall impression of the place. With over 300 institutions to choose from, an objective decision is a near-impossibility, but a few visits will give you a much better idea. All the signs are that universities continue to set great store by these open days. It's their chance to sell themselves to prospective students. To that end, schools and colleges are beginning to receive smart leaflets advertising such events. Cardiff's leaflet describes the \"opportunity for year 11 and 12 pupils, teachers, careers advisers and mature students to see university life as it really is.\" Westminster's open days feature presentations, campus tours and advice stalls, while Bath Spa University College has post-application campus-visit days following their main open day in May.

But as he seeks re-election at next week's NUS conference in Blackpool, he professes no greater political ambitions. Instead, inspired by spending his early childhood in Sudan, he is hoping for a career working in international development. </p> <p>His challenger in this year's elections, current NUS treasurer Helen Aspell, is not a Labour party member. She takes support from the hard left, including the Socialist Workers' Party, the Campaign for Free Education and the Alliance for Workers' Liberty. But in any case she wants to be a firefighter. She hopes to become involved in the Fire Brigades Union on equality issues, but does not want to hold office in it. </p> <p>But reassuringly - or infuriatingly - the NUS conference promises to live up to its reputation of recent years: some pretty pointless platform faction-fighting, lots of shouting and, in among it all, some formal debates, this year on regular favourites - education funding, welfare, student rights and \"building an active union\". </p> <p>Student unions send representatives - one for each 1,000 students - to the conference, who are elected or, in some cases, particularly in the further education colleges, nominated. Well-organised political machines can easily get their people in. </p> <p>After informal hustings on Monday and formal hustings on Tuesday, around 1,000 delegates will vote for the president and five other full-time officers. </p> <p>Neither candidate is prepared to stick their head above the parapet and call for sabbatical officers to be elected by a universal ballot of all NUS members. James, pleased he only has one challenger this year, will be re-elected by a few or lose by a few. Aspell thinks she will win. </p> <p>This hasn't been the sorriest year in NUS history by any means. David Blunkett's 11th-hour pledge to rule out the introduction of top-up fees in the next term of a Labour government has taken some of the heat off James, who is backed by Labour Students this year as last (when they chose not to put up a candidate for election). </p> <p>The NUS has lobbied hard against top-up fees, although the education secretary's decision had arguably much more to do with appeasing middle Britain's parents than assuaging student protest. </p> <p>James logs in his credit column the announcement of the first increase in funding per student for over a decade in November - two days after the biggest student march for around 10 years, involving 17,000 people, complained that it was still falling under Labour. </p> <p>The March 1 \"shutdown\" by students over funding was also successful. James will press the government this year to reintroduce the grant for students from low-income families. Perhaps James's most controversial internal decision was to sign up to a 30-year internet deal with ITM Activate to deliver a new NUS Online service. Some unions complained the deal was poor and much too long. But Aspell, for one, defends it and James says the NUS can give three years' notice to pull out. </p> <p>James, who studied Morse (mathematics, operational research, statistics and economics) at Warwick, says that in the long term the mostly silent majority in the 500,000-strong student community could be more easily mobilised through the database established by NUS Online. With it, the union could have better fought the introduction of top-up fees, he argues. His main regret is that he hasn't made enough inroads into ending factionalism within the union which, he says, has torn it apart for 30 years. </p> <p>Aspell wants to shake the union out of what she regards as its complacent attitude to the majority of its members: part-time and mature students, and students in further education colleges. The organisation has not had a bad year, she thinks, but has done the minimum that could be expected of it. </p> <p>Aspell believes the organisation has been dominated for too long by the interests of 18- to 21-year-olds and those at red brick universities (including her own, Leeds, where she studied history). She has an ambitious agenda to engage part-time and mature students, students with children and students in further education colleges. James, meanwhile, insists the NUS has made great gains in further education colleges in the last year. </p> <p>Beyond that, Aspell plans to link the union with the wider community, with trade unions and parents fighting education privatisation. She will campaign for the abolition of tuition fees and the reintroduction of full maintenance grants for all. Though she doesn't expect the government to deliver all her demands within her presidency, in time she believes the debate can be moved on so that taxpayers, including her future colleagues in the fire service, accept that case.</p> <p><strong>James's plans</strong></p> <p>\"As the first independent president in 30 years my aim has been to put students at the heart of NUS.

Old English is analogous to that.\" </p> <p> But is it? Emily Thornbury, an American graduate student at Cambridge's department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, thinks not. \"I think there's a personality factor involved in separation from the mainstream of English literature.

Even some academics who acknowledge the difficulty of teaching Old English are wary of such an outcome. \"Cambridge have made [OE] separate,\" warns Lawton. \"They've built a wall round it.

I'd been on the waiting list, and when my mum told me the school had phoned to say I'd got in, I cried. </p> <p>\"It was only then that I realised the pressure I'd been under. It really was a stressful process, and I'm very pleased it's over.\" </p> <p>Talk to any parent with a child in year 6 in a primary at the moment and you'll hear lots about how they feel: emotionally wrung out, on the brink of divorce, candidate for the asylum, ready to jack it all in and move to the Hebrides. There can be no doubt in anyone's mind that parents, particularly those in urban areas where competition for secondary schools is sharpest, feel the stress: but what about the kids? </p> <p>Frances is in no doubt that she wasn't the only one in her class, at an inner-London primary, to feel the strain. \"At first when we started looking around the schools it seemed exciting - this idea of a new start, lots of new possibilities,\" she says. </p> <p>\"Then came the applications, and they were OK, too. But then people started taking tests for different schools, and you saw them looking tense and stressed-out. You knew people were working really hard, at home as well as in school. </p> <p>\"But the worst bit came when the results came out and some people were really happy because they'd got where they wanted and others hadn't or they didn't know and they were still really worried. There are some people in my class who still haven't got a place anywhere, and it's quite difficult now when you talk to them. One girl I know wanted to go to the school I'm now going to, and I worry a bit that she'll be jealous because I've got in and she hasn't.\" </p> <p>Frances herself applied for five schools, and got immediate offers of places from three. But that didn't mean the stress was over: she had to choose between two of them, which she liked equally. \"It was hard to know which one to go for - they both had good things and bad. One school only gave you seven days to make up your mind, so the pressure was on.\" Then came her latest offer, from the school whose waiting list she'd gone on to, and it was decision time again. \"I knew in my heart this was the school for me, but I still had to go through everything with my mum and dad to make sure I was doing the right thing,\" she says. </p> <p>Rachel Prior, year 6 teacher at the Holy Ghost School in Balham in south London, says the anxiety that parents feel filters through, and increases through the year. \"They feel under pressure - it doesn't always show at school but I've been hearing about children getting up at night in tears because they're worried.\" </p> <p> Do they talk about it a lot amongst themselves? \"They certainly seem to, especially at first, and then of course they talk about the results when they come through, and about who is going where. What's really difficult is when one child hasn't got into a particular school and another child has - and even though it might be that they didn't fulfil the entrance requirement because they lived in the wrong area, that child still feels he's failed.\" </p> <p>Where children are bound for an independent secondary, parental financial worries can have a knock-on effect on the kids, too, says Prior. \"Families talk about things very openly these days and children know there are financial implications to a particular school, and they take on that worry as well.\" </p> <p>For James Browning, 11, one of Prior's pupils, the stress started with all the traipsing around potential secondaries back in October. </p> <p>\"Most of the schools we looked round had open evenings, and it was really tiring to have to go to these one after another after a long day at school and then homework,\" he says. \"Also at some places the headteachers gave really long speeches and you were up really late - and then you were back in at school the next morning with another evening of it ahead. </p> <p>\"I was lucky - I applied to three schools and I got into the one I really wanted. But I heard of people applying for six or even 10, and sitting loads of tests as a result.\" </p> <p>Parents are increasingly concerned at the effects of all this on the children themselves. \"I think it's too much for a lot of them,\" says one mother who doesn't want to be named. \"At our school five girls applied to the same school and four of them got in - what must it feel like to be the fifth? It's quite unpleasant - how must it be to suffer that kind of rejection at 10? </p> <p>\"One girl I was talking to, a friend of my daughter's, was almost in tears after the offers came through and she told me she thought she'd let her parents down. You have to ask what are we putting our children through.\" </p> <p>The prospect of torn friendships is another big concern for the children. Ten-year-old Charlie d'Auria and 11- year-old Lexy Lyne have been close friends since reception class: now they're off to different secondaries and both are worried about it. \"It's something I think about quite a lot,\" says Charlie. \"Lexy did apply to the school I'm going to, so there was a possibility we might end up together. I knew it was unlikely to work out that way, so I didn't hope too much. But I'm a bit upset now I know we'll be at different places - I'm hoping we'll still see a lot of each other at weekends, though.\" </p> <p>Both Charlie and Lexy say discussions about who had applied where, and later who was going where, dominated their class for many weeks. \"You could tell people were anxious about where they'd be going,\" says Lexy. \"Three-quarters of our class did at least one entrance exam, and in the days leading up you'd feel really nervous and keep thinking about it. Eventually our teacher asked us not to ask other people where they were going: it was fine if they just said it without being asked, but we weren't allowed to question people.\" </p> <p>Psychologist Trevor Jellis, director of the Stein Clinic in Harley Street, which deals with stress in families, says that from the child's point of view, the hardest part of the secondary schools transition is worries over losing friends. That's interesting because talk to parents and you'll find they usually give that aspect hardly any weight at all: but from the kids' point of view, it's hugely significant. \"Children do worry about it, although clearly they are very resilient and most manage to adjust well at their new schools,\" he says. \"Also, life is about adjustment and there is clearly a learning experience here, too.\" </p> <p>Jellis admits that secondary school transition is often stressful for all concerned, but says it's difficult to advise parents about how to avoid it. </p> <p>\"Parents are told they're in this great situation because they've got choice, but when you hear about all the stress it makes you think the reality of this 'choice' is the worst thing of all,\" he says. \"Every parent wants the right education for their child, and in areas where schools select there are inevitably going to be people who are disappointed because their first choice doesn't accept their application. You know it's a risk, but most parents aren't going to let it put them off - there's a sense in which you've really got to suck it and see. You make a statement about what you believe is best, and sometimes you're going to have to make do with what's left. And there's no doubt that will have an effect on the child concerned as much as on the parents.\"</p>",

Alan Milburn, the health secretary, has decided to close the last long stay hospitals after evidence they institutionalise residents and reduce opportunities for independence.

My advice would be to encourage social contact and activity, but not to push it too hard. Sometimes anxiety and lack of confidence is specifically around school peer groups. Sometimes there's the possibility of bullying; sometimes the group in your child's year may simply not be very nice. So find another group; maybe connected to a leisure activity or a hobby.

These can be indicators that something is wrong that the child is not prepared to talk about. If the parent has a good relationship with the child, they should check out a few things.

If you don't have a good ambience then you will not get a good result,\" he said.</p> <p>While Kevin Keegan was England's coach it was widely believed that club cliques had developed in the squad, particularly relating to the Manchester United and Liverpool players.</p> <p>But Eriksson said he was not bothered if players did not dine together. \"I make the line-up when we play, not when we're eating,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I can't tell Paul Scholes to have a cup of tea with Sol Campbell, or for players to share rooms. There are reasons why Scholes and Beckham should have tea together as they are friends. It's about having respect,\" he said. </p> <p>As to his approach to discipline Eriksson said: \"It's not exactly rules. I'm not making 10, 15 or 20 rules and putting them up on the board saying 'this is the regime'. But coming on time, behaving like professional English football players. We are here to get to know each other, to practise, to eat, to rest and to play. That's it.\"</p> <p>Eriksson admitted he had been lucky in the timing of his appointment as England coach given the depth of young talent at his disposal. </p> <p>\"It is good that I have taken over when a English clubs are doing so well in Europe and I am lucky coming into the job when there are so many good, young players. The amount of talent was something that crossed my mind when I accepted the job.\" Eriksson recognises that Paul Scholes remains one of England's most potent weapons. He is the leading scorer in the 26-strong squad with 10 goals in 31 internationals, ahead of Teddy Sheringham (nine in 39) and Michael Owen (eight in 25). Eriksson said: \"Scholes can do anything. He scores goals, defends, dribbles, shoots. He can use his right foot, his left foot and is very difficult to mark.\" Eriksson will not make his team public until an hour before Saturday's game and admitted that he is still to make up his mind over his final line-up. </p> <p>However it is likely to include Steve McManaman if the worrds of Eriksson's right-hand man Tord Grip are anything to go by. Grip believes the Real Madrid player can fill the vacancy on the left created by Nick Barmby's absence through injury. </p> <p>He said: \"He has played a couple of times since he came back from injury and he has done very well. He is playing on the left-hand side in almost every game. If he can perform well in that position then he could play there in the national team if Sven picks him.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sven-Goran Eriksson has stressed the importance of a good atmosphere in the England squad as he prepares his side for the vital World Cup matches against Finland at Anfield on Saturday and Albania in Tirana next Wednesday \"It's very important to me. If you don't have a good ambience then you will not get a good result,\" he said. While Kevin Keegan was England's coach it was widely believed that club cliques had developed in the squad, particularly relating to the Manchester United and Liverpool players. But Eriksson said he was not bothered if players did not dine together. \"I make the line-up when we play, not when we're eating,\" he said. \"I can't tell Paul Scholes to have a cup of tea with Sol Campbell, or for players to share rooms. There are reasons why Scholes and Beckham should have tea together as they are friends. It's about having respect,\" he said. As to his approach to discipline Eriksson said: \"It's not exactly rules. I'm not making 10, 15 or 20 rules and putting them up on the board saying 'this is the regime'. But coming on time, behaving like professional English football players. We are here to get to know each other, to practise, to eat, to rest and to play. That's it.\" Eriksson admitted he had been lucky in the timing of his appointment as England coach given the depth of young talent at his disposal. \"It is good that I have taken over when a English clubs are doing so well in Europe and I am lucky coming into the job when there are so many good, young players. The amount of talent was something that crossed my mind when I accepted the job.\" Eriksson recognises that Paul Scholes remains one of England's most potent weapons. He is the leading scorer in the 26-strong squad with 10 goals in 31 internationals, ahead of Teddy Sheringham (nine in 39) and Michael Owen (eight in 25). Eriksson said: \"Scholes can do anything. He scores goals, defends, dribbles, shoots. He can use his right foot, his left foot and is very difficult to mark.\" Eriksson will not make his team public until an hour before Saturday's game and admitted that he is still to make up his mind over his final line-up. However it is likely to include Steve McManaman if the worrds of Eriksson's right-hand man Tord Grip are anything to go by. Grip believes the Real Madrid player can fill the vacancy on the left created by Nick Barmby's absence through injury. He said: \"He has played a couple of times since he came back from injury and he has done very well. He is playing on the left-hand side in almost every game. If he can perform well in that position then he could play there in the national team if Sven picks him.\"",

We assess ICT through projects in other subjects. Pupils are also given an instruction sheet by the ICT department which outlines the features we want to assess - accuracy, features used, variety, audience, neatness, combination of packages (scanning text, images, charts, tables etc), research (use of the internet), attributing sources plus discretionary marks for effort and distinctiveness. The class then has a couple of weeks to produce the coursework. It is marked by the geography department, according to its criteria, as a piece of geography coursework. It is then marked by the ICT department, according to its criteria, as a piece of ICT coursework showing ICT skills. We also incorporate self-assessment in this process, which motivates the pupils to take a pride in their work. I would strongly encourage schools to embrace the notion of students (no matter how young) evaluating their own and each other's work. The benefits are many, not least of which is a more amiable, team-like atmosphere in even the most uncooperative of groups.",

      "body": "<p>Too often the good ICT ideas developed in classrooms don't get shared and teachers have little chance to learn from colleagues. This year the focus on creativity at the Education Show (National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, March 22-24) is particularly welcome as several exhibitors will offer tools for teachers which will help them share and support each other. A performing arts website will be launched by the British Educational Communciations and Technology agency (stand P38). The site (<a href=\"www.performingwithict.net\">www.performingwithict.net</a>) contains case studies for music, arts and drama and even offers an on-line facility for projects and schools to submit information about their own work. Becta is also hosting a three-hour internet safety seminar on the first day of the show.</p> <p>Learning &amp; Teaching Scotland (C58) has put much care into building effective online learning environments and its new flagship learning environment, Pioneer, will be on show. This is in tandem with several life skills software packages that bring a serious message through bright screen simulations and activities. </p> <p>But the ultimate learning resource is another person and suddenly the ICT world is wising up to this. Companies such as Brainfuse (C1) have built online environments where students and tutors communicate online in real-time. Special facilities exist within the site for blind and visually impaired pupils.</p> <p>Elsewhere, 2Simple (SW25) will launch its latest integrated package, Infant Video Toolbox, which allows teachers to cover all the major requirements of key stages one and two, and even includes the delights of a branching database. The hidden jewel in these resources is a set of screen recordings of the software in action with a calm human voice speaking directly to the teachers. </p> <p>Softease (B63), which seems particularly attuned to teachers' needs, has produced a series of National Curriculum Packs built around its exemplary multimedia software, Textease. The packs provide print and electronic resources to fulfil many of the cross-curricular requirements laid down in QCA guidelines. Have a look also at Textease Studio now sold with 80 free exercises across its key stage range. The way its spreadsheet and databases work and the creative use of appropriate clip art offer a real alternative to Microsoft Office.</p> <p>Granada Learning (B41) continues to gather in the competition and now boasts a stable of software and training opportunities second to none. Its Primary Toolkit is a comprehensive resource and it will also be showing its new internet subscription service, <a href=\"http://www.primary-zone.com\">www.primary-zone.com</a></p> <p>The New Opportunities Fund for teachers training in ICT is having a major effect on ICT considerations in schools.

      "bodyText": "Too often the good ICT ideas developed in classrooms don't get shared and teachers have little chance to learn from colleagues. This year the focus on creativity at the Education Show (National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, March 22-24) is particularly welcome as several exhibitors will offer tools for teachers which will help them share and support each other. A performing arts website will be launched by the British Educational Communciations and Technology agency (stand P38). The site (www.performingwithict.net) contains case studies for music, arts and drama and even offers an on-line facility for projects and schools to submit information about their own work. Becta is also hosting a three-hour internet safety seminar on the first day of the show. Learning &amp; Teaching Scotland (C58) has put much care into building effective online learning environments and its new flagship learning environment, Pioneer, will be on show. This is in tandem with several life skills software packages that bring a serious message through bright screen simulations and activities. But the ultimate learning resource is another person and suddenly the ICT world is wising up to this. Companies such as Brainfuse (C1) have built online environments where students and tutors communicate online in real-time. Special facilities exist within the site for blind and visually impaired pupils. Elsewhere, 2Simple (SW25) will launch its latest integrated package, Infant Video Toolbox, which allows teachers to cover all the major requirements of key stages one and two, and even includes the delights of a branching database. The hidden jewel in these resources is a set of screen recordings of the software in action with a calm human voice speaking directly to the teachers. Softease (B63), which seems particularly attuned to teachers' needs, has produced a series of National Curriculum Packs built around its exemplary multimedia software, Textease. The packs provide print and electronic resources to fulfil many of the cross-curricular requirements laid down in QCA guidelines. Have a look also at Textease Studio now sold with 80 free exercises across its key stage range. The way its spreadsheet and databases work and the creative use of appropriate clip art offer a real alternative to Microsoft Office. Granada Learning (B41) continues to gather in the competition and now boasts a stable of software and training opportunities second to none. Its Primary Toolkit is a comprehensive resource and it will also be showing its new internet subscription service, www.primary-zone.com The New Opportunities Fund for teachers training in ICT is having a major effect on ICT considerations in schools. It also neatly illustrates the troubled path followed when a centralised and over-directed approach is taken to training. One size never did fit all where learning is concerned. \"Imagine what we could we have done if we had been given the money (approximately \u00a3450 per teacher) to spend as we saw fit?\" lament most senior managers I meet in schools. Find out about schools' experiences so far at New Opportunities Fund (S39) You can also pick up pointers here to the various providers who are at the show. As projection costs drop many schools are considering the use of projected images from the computer screen as part of whole class teaching. Whiteboard manufacturer Promethean (P70) will display handheld devices for students which increase the interactivity of the board. Teachers talking to teachers and evaluating resources is the primary intention of Teachers Evaluating Educational Multimedia (Teem) project (A61) and staff will be on hand to advise teachers and show them the best of software on offer. Finally, there are few software success stories to match that of The Skills Factory (SW1) which builds software to help teachers manage and keep literacy and numeracy records. Now the 10,000 teachers using the software can link to a massive Online Resource Bank (ORB TM), with thousands of lesson plans and teaching ideas created by schools already using the system. It's a fine example of ICT at its most powerful. BETT retrospective Homework from C4 On the back of the launch at BETT of products such as JustWrite primary literacy resources, Channel 4 has made great strides in developing home resources such as the BAFTA award-winning Homework High, (www.homeworkhigh.com). Made for and by its users, the site gives students out-of-hours access to expert help from qualified teachers. Portable Macs High interest in Apple Computer's video-editing software during the BETT show has spawned machines for the education market. The style star is the new PowerBook, a one-inch thick, portable computer with a massive 15.2-inch screen screen and G4 processor in a sleek titanium case.

      "body": "<p>A growing number of parents are worried about their children when they are on the internet, given the lurid nature of certain teenage chatrooms and the ease with which adults can infiltrate what are supposed to be teenage-only preserves. Most schools run such well-filtered and protected systems that their pupils cannot get anywhere harmful, but at home it's a different story.</p> <p>Most of the big internet service providers run a \"chatroom\" system with headings such as sport, business, over-50s or teens. People adopt a user name such as Naughty Angel or Rude Rodent and enter a room with up to 150 other users. A constant babble of typing is going on in the main window where everyone can see and respond to everyone else. Usually the hosts (service providers) supervise the main chatrooms, where they root out bad language or sexy talk and ban offenders. Sadly, though, even here not everything is supervised. You can \"whisper\" to an individual, ie hold a private conversation with someone in a separate window, and these are uncensored. This is where the real danger lies - it is quite easy for a newcomer to say, for instance, that they are a 16-year-old lad, but in fact turn out to be a 55-year-old paedophile.</p> <p>In fact, in Microsoft Network (MSN) chatrooms, anyone can be a host and create their own chatroom, which operate under titles such as Hot Teens!, Teens Flirting! and Young Girls Chatting to Older Men. These rooms appear to be unsupervised and the host is responsible for behaviour in the room. You have to apply for membership for chatrooms hosted by service providers, giving your date of birth. Only teens can enter teen sites, and, ironcially, parents and teachers who ought to visit these sites no longer can because of these very restrictions.</p> <p>So what are they being restricted from? A newcomer cannot fail to notice the striking openness and honesty between respondents - they feel safe in their anonymity so they have no reason to lie. But a worrying aspect is the large number of cries for help. Broken families and moving away from relatives mean kids often have no one to turn to for help. Many do not feel able to go to a teacher, and most do not belong to a church or other religious organisation so have no support there either. School counsellors cannot be trusted as they may tell their problems to the school or parents. Alex, 16, said he will \"never trust a counsellor again\" after his parents were told of his problems.</p> <p>What's worse, many teenagers are floundering. A new morality is rearing its head that has its own rules. Many teenagers in these chatrooms take the term \"having sex\" to mean full, penetrative sex. Any other sexual activity seems acceptable at 12 years old, although most \"chatroomers\" indulge from 14-15 years. Experimenting with lesbian, or bisexual activity, has also become increasingly common. This is apparently \"OK\" and, if that is all they have done, the new morality does not believe they have had \"sex\". There are no feelings of right or wrong; the only test is whether both partners feel happy about it. The results of a survey published recently on the BBC children's website showed that 85% of teens thought \"snogging\" in a school corridor was \"OK\".</p> <p>The worst sin now is \"two-timing\"; the rule is one boyfriend to one girlfriend. The second worst is not being honest with each other. My research suggests most girl respondents seem to have sex at 15-16 years, usually with an older lad of 18-20, and this is considered normal. Although a girl's partner is usually two to three years older, heterosexual relations are often between girls of 15-17 and men of 22-25 years. Jayne, 17, told me that she has a 35-year-old taxi-driver boyfriend, who is divorced. She said she wanted a more loving and stable relationship than males of her own age could give.</p> <p>Faced with an upside-down set of values, where do desperate teenagers turn? They often cannot get through to the underfunded ChildLine, and numerous searches for \"Teen Help\" found no professional sites, although the NSPCC has a one and runs a helpline and email service. The award-winning site, Pupiline, is run by a 16-year-old who was being bullied at school. It has a lot of good information on it, and an email help line.</p> <p>One of the MSN UK Teen chat rooms has \"!!!! Advice Room for Teens\" which is staffed by teens. It opens every evening for help and has around 100 visits a week. It also has a site with information on a wide range of topics from eating disorders and abuse to self-harming and pregnancy. There is email support, a discussion notice-board and links to other useful sites. Boy-girl relationships are the commonest problems, but pregnancy, eating disorders, depression, suicidal feelings and \"cutting\" (self-harm) ones are frequent.</p> <p>Pressure of exams is increasing, but bullying and abuse rarely arise. The most frightening thing is how many girls report rape. A typical story relates how 15-year-old Gem was at a club flirting with \"a guy of 22\". They went outside to cool off and kiss. But before she knew it, she was being raped. He did not use a condom. Gem told no one, not even her best friend. She did not know if she was pregnant or infected, and it was weeks before she could even tell someone online. After several online discussions she was persuaded to go to her doctor she was healthy, and not pregnant. Then the adviser asked her if there was an adult she could trust to talk to about it, and she came back a week later to say she had \"told her mum who had been great\".</p> <p>Another case was Sarah, 15. She became constantly depressed, ate very little and when she felt low she cut her arms with a razor. Her parents were always arguing, she said. She felt they hated her and she was afraid they may break up. Sarah used to be good at school, but her work began to deteriorate. She needed professional help, but would not tell anyone.</p> <p>The adviser gave her ChildLine and Samaritan telephone numbers to call, but when she returned to the advice room another day she said that she tried, \"but her voice just wouldn't work\". She kept coming back to the help room and got understanding, comfort and support. Last week reported that she \"hadn't cut herself for two whole weeks!\" She emailed her adviser saying: \"Thanks very much for all the advice you have given me these past few weeks. I really need to get things sorted.\"</p> <p>Ealing Youth Service has a Youth2Youth website and email support service, and has trained young people who run a telephone help line twice a week. Peter Bradley is the clinical supervisor for the Y2Y service which has been running for three years, and has just received a \u00a3125,000 lottery grant to expand. He says it aims to supply a \"quality listening service\" although the demand for advice is so great. The main problems he finds are boy-girl relationships and parent problems, but, surprisingly, not drugs. Depression is a concern; one client has a 54-page dossier. </p> <p>Advice online can work, and it need not cost too much. Demand is great and it just needs more caring teachers and adults to set up other websites and support lines to meet it.</p> <p>These findings are based on research by the author in chats with more than 200 young people over four months.

Only teens can enter teen sites, and, ironcially, parents and teachers who ought to visit these sites no longer can because of these very restrictions. So what are they being restricted from? A newcomer cannot fail to notice the striking openness and honesty between respondents - they feel safe in their anonymity so they have no reason to lie. But a worrying aspect is the large number of cries for help. Broken families and moving away from relatives mean kids often have no one to turn to for help. Many do not feel able to go to a teacher, and most do not belong to a church or other religious organisation so have no support there either. School counsellors cannot be trusted as they may tell their problems to the school or parents. Alex, 16, said he will \"never trust a counsellor again\" after his parents were told of his problems. What's worse, many teenagers are floundering. A new morality is rearing its head that has its own rules. Many teenagers in these chatrooms take the term \"having sex\" to mean full, penetrative sex. Any other sexual activity seems acceptable at 12 years old, although most \"chatroomers\" indulge from 14-15 years. Experimenting with lesbian, or bisexual activity, has also become increasingly common. This is apparently \"OK\" and, if that is all they have done, the new morality does not believe they have had \"sex\". There are no feelings of right or wrong; the only test is whether both partners feel happy about it. The results of a survey published recently on the BBC children's website showed that 85% of teens thought \"snogging\" in a school corridor was \"OK\". The worst sin now is \"two-timing\"; the rule is one boyfriend to one girlfriend. The second worst is not being honest with each other. My research suggests most girl respondents seem to have sex at 15-16 years, usually with an older lad of 18-20, and this is considered normal. Although a girl's partner is usually two to three years older, heterosexual relations are often between girls of 15-17 and men of 22-25 years. Jayne, 17, told me that she has a 35-year-old taxi-driver boyfriend, who is divorced. She said she wanted a more loving and stable relationship than males of her own age could give. Faced with an upside-down set of values, where do desperate teenagers turn? They often cannot get through to the underfunded ChildLine, and numerous searches for \"Teen Help\" found no professional sites, although the NSPCC has a one and runs a helpline and email service. The award-winning site, Pupiline, is run by a 16-year-old who was being bullied at school. It has a lot of good information on it, and an email help line. One of the MSN UK Teen chat rooms has \"!!!! Advice Room for Teens\" which is staffed by teens. It opens every evening for help and has around 100 visits a week. It also has a site with information on a wide range of topics from eating disorders and abuse to self-harming and pregnancy. There is email support, a discussion notice-board and links to other useful sites. Boy-girl relationships are the commonest problems, but pregnancy, eating disorders, depression, suicidal feelings and \"cutting\" (self-harm) ones are frequent. Pressure of exams is increasing, but bullying and abuse rarely arise. The most frightening thing is how many girls report rape. A typical story relates how 15-year-old Gem was at a club flirting with \"a guy of 22\". They went outside to cool off and kiss. But before she knew it, she was being raped. He did not use a condom. Gem told no one, not even her best friend. She did not know if she was pregnant or infected, and it was weeks before she could even tell someone online. After several online discussions she was persuaded to go to her doctor she was healthy, and not pregnant. Then the adviser asked her if there was an adult she could trust to talk to about it, and she came back a week later to say she had \"told her mum who had been great\". Another case was Sarah, 15. She became constantly depressed, ate very little and when she felt low she cut her arms with a razor. Her parents were always arguing, she said. She felt they hated her and she was afraid they may break up. Sarah used to be good at school, but her work began to deteriorate. She needed professional help, but would not tell anyone. The adviser gave her ChildLine and Samaritan telephone numbers to call, but when she returned to the advice room another day she said that she tried, \"but her voice just wouldn't work\". She kept coming back to the help room and got understanding, comfort and support. Last week reported that she \"hadn't cut herself for two whole weeks!\" She emailed her adviser saying: \"Thanks very much for all the advice you have given me these past few weeks. I really need to get things sorted.\" Ealing Youth Service has a Youth2Youth website and email support service, and has trained young people who run a telephone help line twice a week. Peter Bradley is the clinical supervisor for the Y2Y service which has been running for three years, and has just received a \u00a3125,000 lottery grant to expand. He says it aims to supply a \"quality listening service\" although the demand for advice is so great. The main problems he finds are boy-girl relationships and parent problems, but, surprisingly, not drugs. Depression is a concern; one client has a 54-page dossier. Advice online can work, and it need not cost too much. Demand is great and it just needs more caring teachers and adults to set up other websites and support lines to meet it. These findings are based on research by the author in chats with more than 200 young people over four months.

However, its information manager, Nigel Turpin, is well aware that the internet does not provide all the answers, and stresses the importance of maintaining a more \"traditional\" careers library. </p> <p>\"Not everything we have can be made available on the site,\" he says. \"For example, there's little high quality guidance software currently available for free through the web, whereas KUDOS, a CD-rom-based career match program, can be used in all our careers centres. </p> <p>\"Although there are some resources not worth buying because a free website does something very similar, we're conscious that not everyone has home access or fast, reliable connections.\" Nor are cheap web solutions an alternative to expensive staff.

Access to much better information - almost all of it internet-based - is behind that change, but we've had to take the time to learn to use it well. There's a confidence among our year 13s that's quite striking.</p> <p>They're happy with their choices and I'm reassured by how realistic and well informed those have been. We had 95 students applying through the UCAS system this year,and two-thirds had offers before Christmas. I wasn't surprised; the applications were excellent. We start the process of discovery early in year 12. The information they need is available on every computer in school and through their home computers. Many of the intranet resources originally designed for sixth formers are used regularly by pupils from year nine upwards. Course entry information on the UCAS database, for example, is useful for them when choosing their GCSE options. As well as providing easy access to relevant information, we concentrate on giving pupils and staff the tools to deal with it effectively. This includes training sessions on how to get the best out of the web. The tutorial staff work closely with our career adviser on this - it's certainly not a case of just giving pupils a list of websites. Wonderful though this bountiful supply of information is, we couldn't manage without human guidance to make sense of it all.</p> <p><strong>Careers 2: Email careers guidance</strong></p> <p>Will Ritchie is a careers adviser for Grampian Careers, a private company (ex-local authority) covering about 45 secondary schools, plus several colleges and special schools in the Grampian region</p> <p>About nine months ago my job changed significantly when I became an online careers adviser.

It's an effective way of meeting the varied needs of individual clients. </p> <p>The work uses the same skills as face-to-face guidance, but not being able to see the person you're advising does create new challenges. Without visual clues, writing and questioning take on a higher level of importance. It's possible to develop a really constructive relationship with someone in this way, as the dialogue often goes on for quite a while - however long it takes to resolve their problem.</p> <p>The \"talk back\" feature on our site - a series of moderated discussion boards - gives registered users a chance to discuss career concerns, share experiences and get help from our staff.

We've worked at developing a sense of community by inviting regular contributions and responding to them. \"Our student poll, which asks for opinions on topical issues, is popular and engages users. What we put on our site reflects the quality of the service we offer. It's a good way for potential students to evaluate the support they'll get if they join us.\" Careers 1: University choice Peter French is head of sixth form at Cockermouth School, Cumbria, a comprehensive with 1,250 pupils aged 11-18 In the past I used to feel advising sixth formers on university choices was a hit-and-miss affair, but things have changed. Access to much better information - almost all of it internet-based - is behind that change, but we've had to take the time to learn to use it well. There's a confidence among our year 13s that's quite striking. They're happy with their choices and I'm reassured by how realistic and well informed those have been. We had 95 students applying through the UCAS system this year,and two-thirds had offers before Christmas. I wasn't surprised; the applications were excellent. We start the process of discovery early in year 12. The information they need is available on every computer in school and through their home computers. Many of the intranet resources originally designed for sixth formers are used regularly by pupils from year nine upwards. Course entry information on the UCAS database, for example, is useful for them when choosing their GCSE options. As well as providing easy access to relevant information, we concentrate on giving pupils and staff the tools to deal with it effectively. This includes training sessions on how to get the best out of the web. The tutorial staff work closely with our career adviser on this - it's certainly not a case of just giving pupils a list of websites. Wonderful though this bountiful supply of information is, we couldn't manage without human guidance to make sense of it all. Careers 2: Email careers guidance Will Ritchie is a careers adviser for Grampian Careers, a private company (ex-local authority) covering about 45 secondary schools, plus several colleges and special schools in the Grampian region About nine months ago my job changed significantly when I became an online careers adviser. As part of a small team I concentrate on delivering guidance by email in a service available to people of all ages. It complements a wide range of enabling and self-help resources on our website. It's an effective way of meeting the varied needs of individual clients. The work uses the same skills as face-to-face guidance, but not being able to see the person you're advising does create new challenges. Without visual clues, writing and questioning take on a higher level of importance. It's possible to develop a really constructive relationship with someone in this way, as the dialogue often goes on for quite a while - however long it takes to resolve their problem. The \"talk back\" feature on our site - a series of moderated discussion boards - gives registered users a chance to discuss career concerns, share experiences and get help from our staff. We have active boards on subject choice for standard grade courses and a general career choice board. All areas of our website are well used. The freedom to do substantial research first means users are able to get the most from individual guidance sessions. www.grampiancareers.com Career do's and don't's Do... \u0095 Check anything you use at home also works at school. Some sites could be filtered, fail to run on a network or need a plug-in that's not available. \u0095 Suggest paths through websites you're recommending to students. Help them get where they want quickly by highlighting relevant sections. \u0095 Consider making PowerPoint presentations to demonstrate the potential of a website. This overcomes the problem of slow or temporarily unavailable sites and provides ready-made handouts. \u0095 Make sure students have email access to benefit from the further help, alerts and newsletters that are widely available. \u0095 Produce worksheets that encourage documentation of research. Students find it all too easy to spend hours looking at excellent information, then forget where it was or what it said. Put these on your intranet. \u0095 Provide a session for parents showing what's available. If they can access your resources from home or school, they can support their children's research. \u0095 Ensure human guidance is available to help students make sense of the information they're gathering. \u0095 Look at Becta's new resource, Connecting Careers and ICT. This free publication and related support material, including ideas for careers lesson using ICT, is available on www.becta.org. uk/careersict Don't... \u0095 Expect all websites to look the same as the last time you used them because many are being constantly updated. \u0095 Overlook the potential of your \"ordinary\" software. A dedicated CV package may benefit your students lessthan using a word-processor to create their own CV. \u0095 Overwhelm with long lists of sites, but rather show how to use a select few well. Encourage students to add to these by reviewing sites they've found useful. \u0095 Renew annual subscriptions to CD-based programs without first checking whether there is something similar available free on the web. Ask for demonstration copies of software before buying.

Advocacy services are also to be boosted.</p> <p>Launching the proposals, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, said: \"A revolution in care is needed to increase opportunities for thousands of people, their carers and families. Alongside better services, there will be a new drive to improve education and employment opportunities.\"</p> <p>Other plans include a national forum for people with learning disabilities, a national learning disability information centre and helpline with charity Mencap, a learning disability task force, a national citizen advocacy network and national service objectives, underpinned by new targets and performance indicators. </p> <p>Specialist local services for people with severe challenging behaviour, integrated services for children with severe disabilities and individual health plans are also to be developed.</p> <p>Nearly 1.5m people in England have learning disabilities. Of those, 210,000 have severe disabilities, and are long-term health and social services users.

      "bodyText": "The government has promised \"a revolution in care\" for people with learning disabilities, with the launch of the first white paper of its kind in 30 years. Community care, improved day services, social inclusion and a greater say for people with learning disabilities are key elements. Remaining long-stay hospitals are to close, a five-year programme will be set in train to modernise council day services and people will be able to buy their own services under an extension of the \"direct payments\" scheme. The strategy will be backed by a new \u00a3100m learning disability development fund, \u00a36m to develop advocacy services and \u00a32m for research. The white paper, Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century, outlines four \"key principles\": civil rights, inclusion, independence and choice. People with learning disabilities will be able to choose and purchase their care, rather than receiving services determined by their local councils. Advocacy services are also to be boosted. Launching the proposals, the health secretary, Alan Milburn, said: \"A revolution in care is needed to increase opportunities for thousands of people, their carers and families. Alongside better services, there will be a new drive to improve education and employment opportunities.\" Other plans include a national forum for people with learning disabilities, a national learning disability information centre and helpline with charity Mencap, a learning disability task force, a national citizen advocacy network and national service objectives, underpinned by new targets and performance indicators. Specialist local services for people with severe challenging behaviour, integrated services for children with severe disabilities and individual health plans are also to be developed. Nearly 1.5m people in England have learning disabilities. Of those, 210,000 have severe disabilities, and are long-term health and social services users. Around 1.2m are intermittent users of social care and health services. Learning disabilities organisations welcomed the proposals. Dr John Harris, chief executive of the British Institute of Learning Disabilities (BILD), applauded the white paper as a \"bold blueprint for celebrating diversity\". He said the paper \"sets out an ambitious agenda to deliver services that will guarantee people with a learning disability rights, social inclusion, choice and independence\". Simon Cramp, a Mencap trustee with a learning disability, said: \"At last the government is putting individual choice at the heart of learning disability services. We want to make our own choices. \"We want the opportunities and all the basic services so that we can live the life that non-disabled people take for granted.\" Su Sayer, chief executive of charity United Response, said: \"It is time for society to move on from treating people with learning difficulties as if they were unable to work, to participate in everyday activities and have full rights as citizens.\" Mr Milburn promised that the white paper would look at people's lifelong needs and would have cross-government backing. But BILD's Dr Harris warned: \"The big question is whether such an ambitious programme, involving unprecedented collaboration between and across agencies at all levels and over a sustained period of time can deliver the goods.\" The government also announced a \u00a325m education package to identify and tackle learning difficulties in young children, and a working group to develop practical guidance on identifying special educational needs (SEN) in children under two. The package includes \u00a311m to train early years and child care SEN specialists, including up to 850 area specialists who will be working in every registered early years and child care setting by 2004; \u00a33m to set up a regional network of SEN experts to work with local authorities; and \u00a311m to fund services to help young children with SEN.",

Several thousand miles away in a Cambridge computer room, year eight will elaborate those same maps of an African village with captions for the web. They will also send back chatty emails about pizza and Boyzone.</p> <p>For one year, the British and African classes are being linked by internet in a project connected with Comic Relief Web Nose Day last Friday. Effiduase School doesn't have a phone line, but this is no obstacle to its determined link coordinator, Nurrudin Boateng. He downloads on a laptop in town, then lugs a computer, projector and scanner to the barebones school. The children exchange everyday lives- such as how Valentine's Day is being celebrated locally, or the topography of wildly dissimilar environments on the journey to school. British children describe sweet shops; their Ghanaian contemporaries send video footage of men with machetes, and poorer children selling plantain from boxes on their heads.</p> <p>When the mails arrive, unexpected debates start up in the Cambridge classroom - why are the Ghanaian children so vocal about God? Do they really collect water before breakfast? Geography comes to life.</p> <p>But the link goes beyond the artifice of cyberconnection, well beyond geography and ICT: the Cambridge children are avid chocolate lovers, while the Effiduase community are cocoa producers. The Ghanaian children's parents grow cocoa for the Fair Trade brand Dubble, which British children can find (or request) at their local shops. The ICT link bears living testimony to this global interconnection via the \"chocolate chain\" - and for teachers at Parkside, it has proved a popular way to enliven lessons.</p> <p>In PHSE it has provided a natural context to discuss \"choices about spending money\". The Cambridge pupils quickly saw how by choosing Dubble, which pays fair prices for its cocoa, they individually could affect the fortunes of communities in Ghana. Their imaginations were inflamed enough to practise national curriculum rubrics of \"confidence and responsibility\" and \"playing an active role as a citizen\" - they went to lobby local supermarkets about stocking more fair trade brands.</p> <p>\"Even percentages become interesting when taught in terms of cocoa, milk and sugar proportions,\" said one Parkside teacher. \"These and other cross-curriculum ideas came free and ready-made in 'Pa Pa Paa', a Fair Trade lessons pack from Comic Relief, who launched Dubble to promote teen awareness of Fair Trade.\"</p> <p>In art, the Cambridge children have used insights about the farming lives of their e-pen friends to design posters about Dubble and Fair Trade. </p> <p>\"In drama, we took details from the Effiduase children's mails as starting points for scripting TV 'ads' about fair trade,\" Susanna, 13, explained. \"We were shocked to hear that our pen pals had never eaten chocolate - one bar costs a month's cocoa farming earnings, at least.\" Personal contact, via the ICT link, has clearly brought a compelling sense of reality to the classroom. \"Children really focus, act maturely, when we work around the Ghana link,\" says the schools' head of humanities and link coordinator, Jacqueline Billings. In the words of 12-year-old Felix: \"It makes you feel you are doing something useful at school.\"</p> <p>And they are. For this particular link also plays its part in the real-life promotion of Fair Trade. Nuruddin sends letters, maps and digital video. Parkside, being a media specialist school, has lavish edit facilities to cut the most telling material into a succinct form. Among interactive games set in the \"Chocolate Chain\", and teacher's downloads linking fair trade chocolate into curricula for key stages 2 and 3, the evolving interaction between Parkside and Effiduase is posted on <a href=\"http://www.Dubble.co.uk\">www.Dubble.co.uk</a> in a section called \"Dubble Lives\".</p> <p>Without the extra effort of building their own school links, teachers anywhere can tap into the action by visiting the Dubble site. They'll be watching a new relationship between two schools grow, and Billings believes the month-by-month progression of Dubble Lives, as well as its adaptability across the curriculum, should help the concept stick in classrooms everywhere, as it has in her own.</p> <p>Observing another school's link is certainly an easy win. The British Council's Central Bureau for International Education Training can help interested teachers set up links in developing countries; it will even fund technical training and connection costs. But it still takes considerable teacher time to establish objectives and joint project ideas, then a continuing effort to carry it off.</p> <p>For the class in Ghana, the significance of this - or any - website is still a little mystifying. But a health-improving latrine has just opened in the village funded by the premium from fair trade cocoa sales. The chocolate connection is very real.</p> <p>\"It's wild to think that I'm on a website whose address is on the back of a bar of chocolate,' says Gemma, 12, from the edit suite. \"Apart from feeling famous, I like to think that what we're doing is making a difference, getting people to buy Dubble and other things that are Fair Trade.\"</p> <p><strong>Useful websites</strong></p> <p>l For advice and funds to link with schools in developing countries: <a href=\"http://www.centralbureau.org.uk\">www.centralbureau.org.uk</a> and in Ghana specifically: <a href=\"http://www.flameghana.org\">www.flameghana.org</a></p> <p>l For fair trade teaching ideas: <a href=\"www.Dubble.co.uk\">www.Dubble.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cafedirect.co.uk\">www.cafedirect.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fairtrade.org.uk\">www.fairtrade.org.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet\">www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet</a></p> <p>l For other teacher resources and communications technology: <a href=\"http://www.becta.org.uk/international,  www.unesco.org/education/e_learning\">www.becta.org.uk/international, www.unesco.org/education/e_learning</a></p> <p>Comic Relief and Day Chocolate Company launched Dubble in October 2000 as a vehicle to promote Fair trade, a long-term solution to poverty.

The Ghanaian children's parents grow cocoa for the Fair Trade brand Dubble, which British children can find (or request) at their local shops. The ICT link bears living testimony to this global interconnection via the \"chocolate chain\" - and for teachers at Parkside, it has proved a popular way to enliven lessons. In PHSE it has provided a natural context to discuss \"choices about spending money\". The Cambridge pupils quickly saw how by choosing Dubble, which pays fair prices for its cocoa, they individually could affect the fortunes of communities in Ghana. Their imaginations were inflamed enough to practise national curriculum rubrics of \"confidence and responsibility\" and \"playing an active role as a citizen\" - they went to lobby local supermarkets about stocking more fair trade brands. \"Even percentages become interesting when taught in terms of cocoa, milk and sugar proportions,\" said one Parkside teacher. \"These and other cross-curriculum ideas came free and ready-made in 'Pa Pa Paa', a Fair Trade lessons pack from Comic Relief, who launched Dubble to promote teen awareness of Fair Trade.\" In art, the Cambridge children have used insights about the farming lives of their e-pen friends to design posters about Dubble and Fair Trade. \"In drama, we took details from the Effiduase children's mails as starting points for scripting TV 'ads' about fair trade,\" Susanna, 13, explained. \"We were shocked to hear that our pen pals had never eaten chocolate - one bar costs a month's cocoa farming earnings, at least.\" Personal contact, via the ICT link, has clearly brought a compelling sense of reality to the classroom. \"Children really focus, act maturely, when we work around the Ghana link,\" says the schools' head of humanities and link coordinator, Jacqueline Billings. In the words of 12-year-old Felix: \"It makes you feel you are doing something useful at school.\" And they are. For this particular link also plays its part in the real-life promotion of Fair Trade. Nuruddin sends letters, maps and digital video. Parkside, being a media specialist school, has lavish edit facilities to cut the most telling material into a succinct form. Among interactive games set in the \"Chocolate Chain\", and teacher's downloads linking fair trade chocolate into curricula for key stages 2 and 3, the evolving interaction between Parkside and Effiduase is posted on www.Dubble.co.uk in a section called \"Dubble Lives\". Without the extra effort of building their own school links, teachers anywhere can tap into the action by visiting the Dubble site. They'll be watching a new relationship between two schools grow, and Billings believes the month-by-month progression of Dubble Lives, as well as its adaptability across the curriculum, should help the concept stick in classrooms everywhere, as it has in her own. Observing another school's link is certainly an easy win. The British Council's Central Bureau for International Education Training can help interested teachers set up links in developing countries; it will even fund technical training and connection costs. But it still takes considerable teacher time to establish objectives and joint project ideas, then a continuing effort to carry it off. For the class in Ghana, the significance of this - or any - website is still a little mystifying. But a health-improving latrine has just opened in the village funded by the premium from fair trade cocoa sales. The chocolate connection is very real. \"It's wild to think that I'm on a website whose address is on the back of a bar of chocolate,' says Gemma, 12, from the edit suite. \"Apart from feeling famous, I like to think that what we're doing is making a difference, getting people to buy Dubble and other things that are Fair Trade.\" Useful websites l For advice and funds to link with schools in developing countries: www.centralbureau.org.uk and in Ghana specifically: www.flameghana.org l For fair trade teaching ideas: www.Dubble.co.uk, www.cafedirect.co.uk, www.fairtrade.org.uk, www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet l For other teacher resources and communications technology: www.becta.org.uk/international, www.unesco.org/education/e_learning Comic Relief and Day Chocolate Company launched Dubble in October 2000 as a vehicle to promote Fair trade, a long-term solution to poverty. It's the only fair trade product targeted at schoolchildren. The smooth milk chocolate crispy crunch is available in Tesco, Waitrose, Safeway, Sainsbury, Co-op, Asda, Blockbuster and wholefoodshops. Teachers can get a free lesson pack by contacting Comic Relief on 0207-820 5555. Free primary and secondary teaching packs on Fair Trade and chocolate are available from Comic Relief. Each has full colour pull-out pictures, stories, pupil sheets and teacher information and comes in the shape of a huge chocolate bar!

The irritating music, which seemed to be striving to sound like Hannibal, told you it was chilling, but was quite unnecessary. The world being portrayed was so insane and appalling that it needed no props. Germany's doctors, already proponents of eugenics and happy that the exodus of Jewish physicians had freed up the top ranks of their profession, were only too willing to do the devil's work. </p> <p>This was the first in what promises to be an enlightening four-part series about the Nazis' treatment of science. Biology was the natural starting point because Hitler's desire to build the master race underpinned his philosophy (if Mein Kampf can be so designated) and politics. He had read books on eugenics while writing his tract and borrowed from scientific thought in arguing that the German nation had to be cleansed. He didn't tell doctors what to do; he sought to do what doctors were telling him. </p> <p>There was no attempt to sensationalise, other than in the plangency of the strings. The story - and the madhouse-world that was 30s Germany - was sensational enough. A world where, at the behest of doctors, people were forcibly sterilised because they were alcoholics; where children were encouraged to inform on dysfunctional members of their family; where 5,000 disabled children were murdered and their deaths reported to a secret committee established by Hitler to oversee euthanasia. </p> <p>There seemed to be a moral lesson here. Germany was the leading scientific nation in the world in the 1930s, and its doctors appeared to think they could do anything. They were presented not as cartoon villains, but as people who believed they were working for the benefit of mankind. The son of leading eugenicist Alfred Ploetz even dared to call him utopian. They were seeking to eliminate disease; unfortunately, large numbers of people had to be eliminated first. </p> <p>The process began with the voluntary sterilisation of those with disorders that were believed to be hereditary; then came compulsory sterilisation; then euthanasia. The first gas chambers were built to murder 100,000 psychiatric patients and disabled people; the technology was then transferred to the death camps. The programme demonstrated the way in which the \"utopians\" became agents of extermination, each stage of degradation pinpointed. </p> <p>There was little attempt to demonise the doctors, not even Hitler's personal physician Karl Brandt, who oversaw much of the euthanasia programme and was executed at Nuremberg in 1948. Once the eugenic idea - the notion that the race was perfectible - had taken hold, the process assumed a terrible logic. Doctors were making war on the messiness of human life; they dispensed with the Hippocratic oath and sought to play God. </p> <p>The programme had found two eyewitnesses. The testimony of one, a retired civil servant who had been forcibly sterilised because doctors wrongly believed that his deformed hands and feet were hereditary, was moving. He told how before 1933 he had played happily with his boyhood friends; then with the rise of the Hitler Youth they had abandoned him because of his imperfections. His words were more powerful than all the archive footage in shedding light on a sick society. </p> <p>I felt less comfortable with the other witness, a 101-year-old paediatrician from Leipzig who appeared still to support many of the policies pursued in the 30s and described his loathing for the \"idiot\" children who were murdered. Had he ever been prosecuted, one wondered? And was he not too old now to be paraded in this way? </p> <p>This programme did not need to look for individual monsters; what stood condemned was the monstrousness of the machine that science and society became under the Nazis. Everyone, as the historian Daniel Goldhagen has argued, bore some of the guilt for drifting with the tide. Only one doctor refused to take a post vacated by a Jewish academic in the purge of 1933. One among many thousand. From that moment on, Germany was moving towards mechanised destruction, and science and medicine were tuning the engine.</p>",

A world where, at the behest of doctors, people were forcibly sterilised because they were alcoholics; where children were encouraged to inform on dysfunctional members of their family; where 5,000 disabled children were murdered and their deaths reported to a secret committee established by Hitler to oversee euthanasia. There seemed to be a moral lesson here. Germany was the leading scientific nation in the world in the 1930s, and its doctors appeared to think they could do anything. They were presented not as cartoon villains, but as people who believed they were working for the benefit of mankind. The son of leading eugenicist Alfred Ploetz even dared to call him utopian. They were seeking to eliminate disease; unfortunately, large numbers of people had to be eliminated first. The process began with the voluntary sterilisation of those with disorders that were believed to be hereditary; then came compulsory sterilisation; then euthanasia. The first gas chambers were built to murder 100,000 psychiatric patients and disabled people; the technology was then transferred to the death camps. The programme demonstrated the way in which the \"utopians\" became agents of extermination, each stage of degradation pinpointed. There was little attempt to demonise the doctors, not even Hitler's personal physician Karl Brandt, who oversaw much of the euthanasia programme and was executed at Nuremberg in 1948. Once the eugenic idea - the notion that the race was perfectible - had taken hold, the process assumed a terrible logic. Doctors were making war on the messiness of human life; they dispensed with the Hippocratic oath and sought to play God. The programme had found two eyewitnesses. The testimony of one, a retired civil servant who had been forcibly sterilised because doctors wrongly believed that his deformed hands and feet were hereditary, was moving. He told how before 1933 he had played happily with his boyhood friends; then with the rise of the Hitler Youth they had abandoned him because of his imperfections. His words were more powerful than all the archive footage in shedding light on a sick society. I felt less comfortable with the other witness, a 101-year-old paediatrician from Leipzig who appeared still to support many of the policies pursued in the 30s and described his loathing for the \"idiot\" children who were murdered. Had he ever been prosecuted, one wondered? And was he not too old now to be paraded in this way? This programme did not need to look for individual monsters; what stood condemned was the monstrousness of the machine that science and society became under the Nazis. Everyone, as the historian Daniel Goldhagen has argued, bore some of the guilt for drifting with the tide. Only one doctor refused to take a post vacated by a Jewish academic in the purge of 1933. One among many thousand. From that moment on, Germany was moving towards mechanised destruction, and science and medicine were tuning the engine.",

Thomas Duncan, 33, was later jailed for life at the high court in Edinburgh.</p> <p>Earlier this month an independent inquiry by consultant pediatrician Helen Hammond concluded the death could have been prevented had social workers and others heeded the warning signs from repeated concerns, referrals and hospital admissions.</p> <p>The inquiry also recommended that an audit of child protection processes across Scotland be carried out to look at the consistency and quality of practice among individual agencies and agencies working together.</p> <p>Announcing the review, Mr McConnell said: \"Although a lot has been done to improve child protection in recent years, we must do all we can to ensure our systems do not fail those vulnerable children that rely on them. I am determined that we will do our best to prevent a repeat of this kind of incident.</p> <p>\"It is vital that we do more than just talk about joined-up working. We must ensure that everyone - local government, agencies and departments - work better together locally to give the best service possible to our young people. No child should ever fall through the protection net just because professionals fail to work closely together.\"</p> <p>The review will be carried out by the social work services inspectorate and health department with support from the schools and police inspectorates. No timescale has been given but it is likely to last up to 18 months.</p> <p>The last major overhaul of child protection legislation came in 1995 with the introduction of the Children (Scotland) Act. But this was largely a result of the 1992 Orkney and Fife inquiries and is now seen as in need of updating.</p> <p>Anne Stafford, head of policy at Children 1st, formerly the Royal Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children, said she did not believe a \"root and branch\" overhaul of child care legislation was required.</p> <p>\"Very few children die each year at the hands of their parents in Scotland. But one child is one too many and so we welcome this look again the child protection system,\" she said.</p> <p>\"We have known the messages for a long time and we do have systems in place. But it is important to think about the relationships between teams working together and to make sure the system is working well nationally, and not just in patches.\"</p> <p>The Association of Directors of Social Work welcomed the review but said it hoped it would take a wider view of services aimed at helping and supporting children and families.</p> <p>\"Agencies involved in child protection have increasingly worked well together to deliver improved services. But it is right that from time to time progress is reviewed and the systems in place checked to ensure they are working effectively,\" said vice-president Carole Wilkinson.</p> <p>\"Councils in the past have been criticised for having too narrow a focus. It is important that we ensure children who need help with their education, getting on with their families, and with their offending or drug misuse also get attention.\"</p>",

Earlier this month an independent inquiry by consultant pediatrician Helen Hammond concluded the death could have been prevented had social workers and others heeded the warning signs from repeated concerns, referrals and hospital admissions. The inquiry also recommended that an audit of child protection processes across Scotland be carried out to look at the consistency and quality of practice among individual agencies and agencies working together. Announcing the review, Mr McConnell said: \"Although a lot has been done to improve child protection in recent years, we must do all we can to ensure our systems do not fail those vulnerable children that rely on them. I am determined that we will do our best to prevent a repeat of this kind of incident. \"It is vital that we do more than just talk about joined-up working. We must ensure that everyone - local government, agencies and departments - work better together locally to give the best service possible to our young people. No child should ever fall through the protection net just because professionals fail to work closely together.\" The review will be carried out by the social work services inspectorate and health department with support from the schools and police inspectorates. No timescale has been given but it is likely to last up to 18 months. The last major overhaul of child protection legislation came in 1995 with the introduction of the Children (Scotland) Act. But this was largely a result of the 1992 Orkney and Fife inquiries and is now seen as in need of updating. Anne Stafford, head of policy at Children 1st, formerly the Royal Scottish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children, said she did not believe a \"root and branch\" overhaul of child care legislation was required. \"Very few children die each year at the hands of their parents in Scotland. But one child is one too many and so we welcome this look again the child protection system,\" she said. \"We have known the messages for a long time and we do have systems in place. But it is important to think about the relationships between teams working together and to make sure the system is working well nationally, and not just in patches.\" The Association of Directors of Social Work welcomed the review but said it hoped it would take a wider view of services aimed at helping and supporting children and families. \"Agencies involved in child protection have increasingly worked well together to deliver improved services. But it is right that from time to time progress is reviewed and the systems in place checked to ensure they are working effectively,\" said vice-president Carole Wilkinson. \"Councils in the past have been criticised for having too narrow a focus. It is important that we ensure children who need help with their education, getting on with their families, and with their offending or drug misuse also get attention.\"",

In an initiative that will outshine any prize yet offered on a gameshow, Survivor will send next year's winning contestant into space. The producer of the show, dreamt up by former Carlton boss Lord Waheed Alli, is in talks with the Russian Space Agency to send the winner to the International Space Station, which is currently under construction. The final frontier for the advertising industry is also about to be reached - the space station will carry advertising. The Russian Space Agency and US space buffs last year created an organisation called Mircorp to examine commercial opportunities for the existing Mir space station. But ideas about renting out Mir for space tourism or leasing it as a film set were dashed when it began to deteriorate. Mir is due to crash-land back on earth this week. Now Mircorp is looking at commercial tie-ins for the US-led International Space Station, which will be completed in 2006. Gert Weyers, project manager for Mircorp, said the group was working with Survivor's US producer to launch a contestant into space. \"They are definite plans, we will go through with the project. 2002 will see a contestant go up to the International Space Station in an extra seat,\" Mr Weyers told Radio 4's Today programme.

The bulletin has no doubt benefited from viewers' tendency to turn to the BBC for information on national crises, such as railway safety and foot and mouth disease. BBC1 has also been more competitive earlier in the evening, attracting good audiences for crime dramas such as Silent Witness and In Deep and high ratings for the Phil Mitchell shooting storyline in EastEnders. Elsewhere last night, ITV docusoap Airline beat BBC1 quiz show the Weakest Link from 8.30pm. Airline pulled in 10.3m viewers and a 40% share, while the Weakest Link had 7.6m.

      "body": "<p>Never has a rightwing schoolmistress given so much pleasure to so many as did Ann Widdecombe in October 2000, when the Tory home affairs spokeswoman fell flat on her face after proposing, in her own inimitable style, a \u00a3100 on-the-spot fine for cannabis use.</p> <p>The whole of the liberal left, the police and even the young trendies on the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail, tore into her.</p> <p>They chortled too when seven of her shadow cabinet colleagues rushed to confess they had experimented in their youth with cannabis. Then came the additional blow of Miss Widdecombe's nephew confessing to the News of the World that he had been jailed for drugs use. It was quite a kicking for an MP who had risen from Tory obscurity to media darling in less than a decade.</p> <p>But these setbacks have not written off her hopes of winning the party leadership - and Miss Widdecombe may yet be the \"second coming\" of Thatcher - frustrating Michael Portillo's hopes of taking the same job if William Hague fails to dismantle the Labour government's majority at the next election. Her simple authoritarian appeal has a resonance among the grey-haired rank and file members who now dominate the shrunken Tory party and the increasingly rightwing and europhobic Tory MPs.</p> <p>Partly because of her operatic style, and partly because of her absolute commitment to hard-right views, she has risen in prominence and is arguably the only Tory apart from Mr Hague and Mr Portillo most voters could name. For many, her proposals to extend sentences and spend millions on \"secure\" detention centres for the 75,000 asylum seekers arriving annually in Britain struck a chord.</p> <p>Even her oft-proclaimed virginity seems more appealing to the primitive right than Mr Portillo's delayed admission of bisexuality - although some voters of course will be puzzled by her defence of capital punishment but opposition to fox hunting.</p> <p>In an even more calculated fashion than her equally reactionary party colleague Baroness Young, Miss Widdecombe has assiduously cultivated Britain's \"moral majority\". A member of the society for the protection of the unborn child from her Oxford days, she was also an early opponent in the Commons of laws allowing easier abortion.</p> <p>An opponent of ordaining women or divorced men, she first criticised very publicly, and then deserted the \"weak kneed liberals\" in the Anglican Church into which she was born to return to the Roman Catholic church in which she had been educated. Her reception into the Catholic Church was no private personal affair. Amidst massive self-generated publicity she became the first person since the Reformation to be received into the Catholic Church in the crypt of the Commons.</p> <p>A fairly restrained eurosceptic herself, Miss Widdecombe is a throwback to the pre-war imperial Tories. Although born in Bath in 1947, her early life was spent in colonial Singapore where her father, James, was head of naval supplies. She still visits regularly her amah (nanny) there, and is a known admirer of the country's cleanliness under its authoritarian government.</p> <p>When she returned to Bath, she attended a strict Catholic convent, La Sainte Union, where eating meat on Friday was still a mortal sin. She said: \"Religion was pushed down your throat. We were forced to go to mass and benediction, but not allowed to attend our own [Anglican] church.\"</p> <p>She went on to Birmingham University for a BA in Latin and then Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she studied PPE. Very attractive when young, she had a three-year romance at Oxford but it clearly ended before any lasting damage was done. Asked about sex, she answers: \"Yuk! Spare me! That's one thing I don't miss.\" She prefers her cats.</p> <p>Miss Widdecombe got the political bug at the Oxford Union, where she was secretary and then treasurer, and helped fellow Tory Michael Ancram in his two 1974 elections. In 1982 she made her name with Lady Olga Maitland as co-founders of women and families for defence, the CND-baiting group. She fought the hopeless seat of Burnley in 1979, where she halved Labour's majority. In 1983 she fought Dr David Owen at Plymouth Devonport, losing again.</p> <p>Her luck turned when she was selected for the Tory stronghold of Maidstone, which had turned down Margaret Thatcher 25 years before, becoming its first woman MP in 1987. She made her maiden speech in a defence debate, enthusing about Trident as \"an effective nuclear deterrent\". Her headstrong qualities became apparent in support of David Alton's effort to drastically reduce the time limit for permitted abortions.</p> <p>In 1988 she launched her own private member's bill to curb abortion, using tactics which affronted fellow anti-abortionist Tories such as Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman. A decade later, her office walls were still covered with posters showing foetuses.</p> <p>She strengthened her reputation with the hard right by telling those who had voted for a Liberal Democrat in place of the IRA-murdered Ian Gow that the IRA would be \"toasting their success\".</p> <p>When Mrs Thatcher was deposed in November 1990, Miss Widdecombe refused to dine with Edwina Currie and Emma Nicholson, whom she labelled as anti-Thatcher \"traitors\". She later backed Douglas Hurd as Mrs Thatcher's successor. Despite this, John Major promoted her to under secretary for social security, no doubt to appease Thatcherites. There she said there was \"no reason why a person on social security should not be able to afford a normal healthy diet.\"</p> <p>She became embroiled in serious controversy after her promotion to minister of state in the Home Office, under fellow rightwinger Michael Howard. She later fell out with Mr Howard over his sacking of Derek Lewis, director general of the prison service, and devastatingly accused him of having \"something of the night\" about him.</p> <p>Not only did this quip destroy Mr Howard's hopes of becoming party leader after the 1997 election, it also made Miss Widdecombe something of a celebrity.

      "bodyText": "Never has a rightwing schoolmistress given so much pleasure to so many as did Ann Widdecombe in October 2000, when the Tory home affairs spokeswoman fell flat on her face after proposing, in her own inimitable style, a \u00a3100 on-the-spot fine for cannabis use. The whole of the liberal left, the police and even the young trendies on the Daily Telegraph and Daily Mail, tore into her. They chortled too when seven of her shadow cabinet colleagues rushed to confess they had experimented in their youth with cannabis. Then came the additional blow of Miss Widdecombe's nephew confessing to the News of the World that he had been jailed for drugs use. It was quite a kicking for an MP who had risen from Tory obscurity to media darling in less than a decade. But these setbacks have not written off her hopes of winning the party leadership - and Miss Widdecombe may yet be the \"second coming\" of Thatcher - frustrating Michael Portillo's hopes of taking the same job if William Hague fails to dismantle the Labour government's majority at the next election. Her simple authoritarian appeal has a resonance among the grey-haired rank and file members who now dominate the shrunken Tory party and the increasingly rightwing and europhobic Tory MPs. Partly because of her operatic style, and partly because of her absolute commitment to hard-right views, she has risen in prominence and is arguably the only Tory apart from Mr Hague and Mr Portillo most voters could name. For many, her proposals to extend sentences and spend millions on \"secure\" detention centres for the 75,000 asylum seekers arriving annually in Britain struck a chord. Even her oft-proclaimed virginity seems more appealing to the primitive right than Mr Portillo's delayed admission of bisexuality - although some voters of course will be puzzled by her defence of capital punishment but opposition to fox hunting. In an even more calculated fashion than her equally reactionary party colleague Baroness Young, Miss Widdecombe has assiduously cultivated Britain's \"moral majority\". A member of the society for the protection of the unborn child from her Oxford days, she was also an early opponent in the Commons of laws allowing easier abortion. An opponent of ordaining women or divorced men, she first criticised very publicly, and then deserted the \"weak kneed liberals\" in the Anglican Church into which she was born to return to the Roman Catholic church in which she had been educated. Her reception into the Catholic Church was no private personal affair. Amidst massive self-generated publicity she became the first person since the Reformation to be received into the Catholic Church in the crypt of the Commons. A fairly restrained eurosceptic herself, Miss Widdecombe is a throwback to the pre-war imperial Tories. Although born in Bath in 1947, her early life was spent in colonial Singapore where her father, James, was head of naval supplies. She still visits regularly her amah (nanny) there, and is a known admirer of the country's cleanliness under its authoritarian government. When she returned to Bath, she attended a strict Catholic convent, La Sainte Union, where eating meat on Friday was still a mortal sin. She said: \"Religion was pushed down your throat. We were forced to go to mass and benediction, but not allowed to attend our own [Anglican] church.\" She went on to Birmingham University for a BA in Latin and then Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, where she studied PPE. Very attractive when young, she had a three-year romance at Oxford but it clearly ended before any lasting damage was done. Asked about sex, she answers: \"Yuk! Spare me! That's one thing I don't miss.\" She prefers her cats. Miss Widdecombe got the political bug at the Oxford Union, where she was secretary and then treasurer, and helped fellow Tory Michael Ancram in his two 1974 elections. In 1982 she made her name with Lady Olga Maitland as co-founders of women and families for defence, the CND-baiting group. She fought the hopeless seat of Burnley in 1979, where she halved Labour's majority. In 1983 she fought Dr David Owen at Plymouth Devonport, losing again. Her luck turned when she was selected for the Tory stronghold of Maidstone, which had turned down Margaret Thatcher 25 years before, becoming its first woman MP in 1987. She made her maiden speech in a defence debate, enthusing about Trident as \"an effective nuclear deterrent\". Her headstrong qualities became apparent in support of David Alton's effort to drastically reduce the time limit for permitted abortions. In 1988 she launched her own private member's bill to curb abortion, using tactics which affronted fellow anti-abortionist Tories such as Dame Elaine Kellett-Bowman. A decade later, her office walls were still covered with posters showing foetuses. She strengthened her reputation with the hard right by telling those who had voted for a Liberal Democrat in place of the IRA-murdered Ian Gow that the IRA would be \"toasting their success\". When Mrs Thatcher was deposed in November 1990, Miss Widdecombe refused to dine with Edwina Currie and Emma Nicholson, whom she labelled as anti-Thatcher \"traitors\". She later backed Douglas Hurd as Mrs Thatcher's successor. Despite this, John Major promoted her to under secretary for social security, no doubt to appease Thatcherites. There she said there was \"no reason why a person on social security should not be able to afford a normal healthy diet.\" She became embroiled in serious controversy after her promotion to minister of state in the Home Office, under fellow rightwinger Michael Howard. She later fell out with Mr Howard over his sacking of Derek Lewis, director general of the prison service, and devastatingly accused him of having \"something of the night\" about him. Not only did this quip destroy Mr Howard's hopes of becoming party leader after the 1997 election, it also made Miss Widdecombe something of a celebrity. A rare Tory woman, she rose rapidly with Hague as leader, joining the shadow cabinet as health spokesman in 1998. She made a barnstorming, noteless speech to the party conference - a performance she repeated in Blackpool in 1999, this time as shadow home secretary. There she won some unexpected plaudits from the left for her emphasis on the need for prison reform and education. But those plaudits became brickbats in Bournemouth in 2000 where her ill thought out references to drugs enraged colleagues and left her looking foolish. Ask Aristotle about Ann Widdecombe",

      "body": "<p>At the heart of Labour's NHS reforms is the belief that the NHS should be dependable - that it should be able to guarantee \"fair access and high quality to patients wherever they live\".</p> <p>When the government came to power in 1997, it said the NHS was in danger of losing public confidence; it was aloof and paternalistic, slow to respond to medical advances and suffered from huge variations in access to services and treatments - the so-called \"postcode lottery\".</p> <p>Since then, the government has attempted to reform the NHS with a vast inter-linking network of measures aimed at setting, monitoring and enforcing clear national standards of care and quality, making the service more dynamic, patient-friendly and safer, cutting waiting times and giving patients more choice over where and when they are treated.</p> <p>The 1998 white paper A First Class Service - Quality in the new NHS sets out how these measures will be introduced. Standards of care will be set through the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (Nice), and through national service frameworks (NSFs). </p> <p>The latter spell out how specific services - so far, coronary heart disease and mental health, with more planned - should be organised to ensure the best quality and fairest access. </p> <p>Nice produces guidance about which treatments work best, and which drugs should be available on the NHS. In Scotland this role is carried out by the Health Technology Board for Scotland. </p> <p>Standards will be delivered locally through clinical governance - essentially a kind of quality assurance audit of treatment, self-regulation of clinicians and improved training for staff.</p> <p>Scotland and Wales will develop their own quality assurance and accreditation systems.</p> <p>Monitoring of standards will take place in England and Wales principally though the Commission for Health Improvement (CHI), which also has the power to investigate failing services, and the Audit Commission.</p> <p>The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland will monitor trust performance north of the border and ensure clinical guidelines are implemented.</p> <p>A performance assessment framework has been established for England, identifying six key areas of NHS performance. Each year tables are published comparing health authority and trust performance.</p> <p>National performance assessment frameworks are being developed in both Wales and Scotland. The six areas of performance are: health improvement; fair access to services; effective and appropriate delivery of health care; positive outcomes from health care; efficient use of resources; and an overall high quality of experience for patients and carers. The NHS plan, published in July 2000, introduces a further package of measures designed for the \"protection of patients\". These include: new mechanisms for dealing with poor performing doctors, including the national clinical assessment authority and reforms to the doctors regulatory body, the General Medical Council.</p> <p>The NHS plan also pushes forward the performance agenda: it promises a \"limited number of ambitious but achievable national targets\" such as shorter waiting times for treatment.</p> <p>It also introduces financial incentives for trusts in England - but not in Wales or Scotland - to raise performance standards, whereby the best performing trusts have access to a National Health Performance Fund worth \u00a3500m a year by 2004.</p> <p>The first few months of the systems has thrown up a dilemma for the NHS over how it handles performance monitoring. How does it identify examples of poor practice, and publicise them, without alienating the NHS by \"naming and shaming\", or undermining public confidence in the NHS?</p> <p>The new approach has come under fire in some quarters for being too centralised and prescriptive. Labour has promised \"earned autonomy\" for health services who perform well - but there is suspicion that this is the reward for doing it Labour's way.</p>",

When the government came to power in 1997, it said the NHS was in danger of losing public confidence; it was aloof and paternalistic, slow to respond to medical advances and suffered from huge variations in access to services and treatments - the so-called \"postcode lottery\". Since then, the government has attempted to reform the NHS with a vast inter-linking network of measures aimed at setting, monitoring and enforcing clear national standards of care and quality, making the service more dynamic, patient-friendly and safer, cutting waiting times and giving patients more choice over where and when they are treated. The 1998 white paper A First Class Service - Quality in the new NHS sets out how these measures will be introduced. Standards of care will be set through the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (Nice), and through national service frameworks (NSFs). The latter spell out how specific services - so far, coronary heart disease and mental health, with more planned - should be organised to ensure the best quality and fairest access. Nice produces guidance about which treatments work best, and which drugs should be available on the NHS. In Scotland this role is carried out by the Health Technology Board for Scotland. Standards will be delivered locally through clinical governance - essentially a kind of quality assurance audit of treatment, self-regulation of clinicians and improved training for staff. Scotland and Wales will develop their own quality assurance and accreditation systems. Monitoring of standards will take place in England and Wales principally though the Commission for Health Improvement (CHI), which also has the power to investigate failing services, and the Audit Commission. The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland will monitor trust performance north of the border and ensure clinical guidelines are implemented. A performance assessment framework has been established for England, identifying six key areas of NHS performance. Each year tables are published comparing health authority and trust performance. National performance assessment frameworks are being developed in both Wales and Scotland. The six areas of performance are: health improvement; fair access to services; effective and appropriate delivery of health care; positive outcomes from health care; efficient use of resources; and an overall high quality of experience for patients and carers. The NHS plan, published in July 2000, introduces a further package of measures designed for the \"protection of patients\". These include: new mechanisms for dealing with poor performing doctors, including the national clinical assessment authority and reforms to the doctors regulatory body, the General Medical Council. The NHS plan also pushes forward the performance agenda: it promises a \"limited number of ambitious but achievable national targets\" such as shorter waiting times for treatment. It also introduces financial incentives for trusts in England - but not in Wales or Scotland - to raise performance standards, whereby the best performing trusts have access to a National Health Performance Fund worth \u00a3500m a year by 2004. The first few months of the systems has thrown up a dilemma for the NHS over how it handles performance monitoring. How does it identify examples of poor practice, and publicise them, without alienating the NHS by \"naming and shaming\", or undermining public confidence in the NHS? The new approach has come under fire in some quarters for being too centralised and prescriptive. Labour has promised \"earned autonomy\" for health services who perform well - but there is suspicion that this is the reward for doing it Labour's way.",

The whole process could leave the unions with a bill approaching \u00a310,000. \"The unions have to be very clear and stick to the law,\" says Paul O' Shea, regional secretary with Unison's south west region, The days of the caricatured trade union member downing tools over the merest inconvenience have long gone. These rules, say union members, are designed to check any initial enthusiasm for action. \"They take the heat out of the situation,\" says Martin Smith, an organiser with the GMB London region. Getting an accurate figure on how many local government workers take action each year is difficult. In 1999, Office for National Statistics figures show that 35,000 working days were lost to action across the public sector. By last year that had climbed to just over 53,000. Although strike action has declined over recent years - figures from the international Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development show Britain has the eighth lowest total among 23 member countries - there is a belief that this could change in local government. \"There is an increase in militancy amongst members and those coming into the movement. I think there's going to be a lot of action,\" says Mr Smith.",

I'm not very lucky with the teams I choose to play for.\" He has also been the butt of training ground humour. \"When we train my team-mates are constantly saying stupid things. They say 'Hey, Jimmy, do you know where we were last season without you? Now you are here and we're trying not to get relegated.' \"",

Bill Gates is hoping to convert the 230m people who use Microsoft software to his latest technological development and ultimately knock internet giants such as AOL Time Warner and Yahoo! off their perches. Microsoft's much-vaunted \".Net strategy\" was unveiled last summer but was derided as badly conceived and confusing by journalists and analysts alike. Microsoft expects the new system, tentatively called HailStorm, to be as big as Windows, its dominant PC software. The move will pit the software giant directly against the likes of AOL Time Warner and Yahoo, who are also currently building their businesses around cross-platform internet services. It will effectively integrate Microsoft's operations, from its free Passport service that lets users store passwords and credit card numbers so they don't have to keep typing them in, to Hotmail and MSN Messenger, Microsoft's instant messaging service. Instead of just buying a plane ticket from Microsoft's Expedia, when users subscribe to HailStorm's services they will be able to use any platform - computer, handheld device or mobile - to buy products, order currency, download destination information and then find out whether the plane is on time. In its final form, HailStorm will act as a simple organiser for users who can access all the services while on the move. In order to develop HailStorm, Microsoft has to work with competitors such as Apple and Palm, as well as sign up e-commerce companies including eBay. \"The whole vision of having multiple devices can only work if magically, behind the scenes, the information is moving between those devices without the user having to be involved,\" said Mr Gates, Microsoft's chairman and chief software architect. Mr Gates said he believed Microsoft customers, of which there are 230m worldwide, would be willing to pay for these type of services as well as forking out for computer software such as Microsoft Office. The step towards subscription-based internet service could speed up the desperately required revamp of the internet industry, which has hitherto relied on banner advertising and sponsorships.

      "body": "<p>The conservative right controls the US executive and legislature by the narrowest of margins. Now, in a quiet but crucial struggle under way in Washington, it is trying to use that advantage to remould the third branch of government, the judiciary, in its own image.</p> <p>The battle's first volleys were fired yesterday, when the leaders of the American Bar Association (ABA), the US lawyers' professional body, were summoned by President Bush's chief legal adviser, Alberto Gonzalez, and told its half-century-old role as a vetting filter for federal judicial appointments might be at an end. If so, it will be treated just like any another pressure group.</p> <p>If the ABA is knocked off its perch, it would represent a decisive victory for the Federalist Society, a conservative group little known outside US legal circles, but one which has amassed a significant degree of power behind the scenes, in law schools and legal firms around the country.</p> <p>All this may sound dusty and arcane, but it could yet prove to be even more significant for the long-term future of the US than last year's turbulent election. In the States some of the defining policy judgments of recent decades have been made by the courts, including Roe v Wade, guaranteeing the right to an abortion, or Brown v the Board of Education, desegregating schools.</p> <p>The Federalist Society is seeking to gain control of the federal courts in order to recast the American legal landscape for a generation. In particular, the Federalists, drawing their inspiration from the writings of James Madison, one of the nation's \"founding fathers\", want to cut back the role of central government to the minimum possible.</p> <p>They are opposed, in particular, to Washington's role in promoting racial equality through affirmative action. They are against sexual harassment and gender equality laws, which they see as an infringement on the rights of private organisations.</p> <p>The Federalists are also opposed to the powers of the environmental protection agency - pollution control, they argue, should be regulated by the free market or, at most, by local or state government.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the ABA, which is identified with the legal status quo of the postwar era, has been painted as hopelessly liberal by the conservative right. The irony underlying the current situation is that the conservatives, for all their faith in states' rights and limited federal government, were brought to power in December by an act of federal intervention in what is normally considered a state matter.</p> <p>Federalists would generally argue that debates over the conduct of elections in any state are the exclusive concern of the courts of that state. However, when the Florida supreme court ordered a manual recount of votes in the presidential election claimed by George Bush, it was Ted Olson, a leading member of the Federalist Society, who argued the case for federal intervention, and it was Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, the society's two patrons in the supreme court, who helped Bush ultimately to prevail.</p> <p>Mr Olson is now solicitor general, and is in the company of plenty of other Federalists in the new administration. Spencer Abraham, the anti-regulation energy secretary, is a founder member, as is his chief legal adviser, Lee Liberman Otis.</p> <p>Filling judicial posts was never a priority for the Clinton administration, and many vacancies on federal district and appeals courts around the country went unfilled for years.

      "bodyText": "The conservative right controls the US executive and legislature by the narrowest of margins. Now, in a quiet but crucial struggle under way in Washington, it is trying to use that advantage to remould the third branch of government, the judiciary, in its own image. The battle's first volleys were fired yesterday, when the leaders of the American Bar Association (ABA), the US lawyers' professional body, were summoned by President Bush's chief legal adviser, Alberto Gonzalez, and told its half-century-old role as a vetting filter for federal judicial appointments might be at an end. If so, it will be treated just like any another pressure group. If the ABA is knocked off its perch, it would represent a decisive victory for the Federalist Society, a conservative group little known outside US legal circles, but one which has amassed a significant degree of power behind the scenes, in law schools and legal firms around the country. All this may sound dusty and arcane, but it could yet prove to be even more significant for the long-term future of the US than last year's turbulent election. In the States some of the defining policy judgments of recent decades have been made by the courts, including Roe v Wade, guaranteeing the right to an abortion, or Brown v the Board of Education, desegregating schools. The Federalist Society is seeking to gain control of the federal courts in order to recast the American legal landscape for a generation. In particular, the Federalists, drawing their inspiration from the writings of James Madison, one of the nation's \"founding fathers\", want to cut back the role of central government to the minimum possible. They are opposed, in particular, to Washington's role in promoting racial equality through affirmative action. They are against sexual harassment and gender equality laws, which they see as an infringement on the rights of private organisations. The Federalists are also opposed to the powers of the environmental protection agency - pollution control, they argue, should be regulated by the free market or, at most, by local or state government. Meanwhile, the ABA, which is identified with the legal status quo of the postwar era, has been painted as hopelessly liberal by the conservative right. The irony underlying the current situation is that the conservatives, for all their faith in states' rights and limited federal government, were brought to power in December by an act of federal intervention in what is normally considered a state matter. Federalists would generally argue that debates over the conduct of elections in any state are the exclusive concern of the courts of that state. However, when the Florida supreme court ordered a manual recount of votes in the presidential election claimed by George Bush, it was Ted Olson, a leading member of the Federalist Society, who argued the case for federal intervention, and it was Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, the society's two patrons in the supreme court, who helped Bush ultimately to prevail. Mr Olson is now solicitor general, and is in the company of plenty of other Federalists in the new administration. Spencer Abraham, the anti-regulation energy secretary, is a founder member, as is his chief legal adviser, Lee Liberman Otis. Filling judicial posts was never a priority for the Clinton administration, and many vacancies on federal district and appeals courts around the country went unfilled for years. The Bush administration has taken control of the judiciary much more seriously, and has made filling the 100 currently vacant positions a priority. The young team that has been assembled to vet candidates is made up exclusively of Federalists, several of whom worked as clerks for Justices Scalia and Thomas. Others were staffers for Kenneth Starr, President Clinton's leading inquisitor in the impeachment drama, and another Federalist leading light. Social liberals have watched the steady rise of the Federalists with alarm. The Institute for Democracy Studies (IDS), a liberal watchdog, has analysed the society's burgeoning power and sees it as a threat to the advances made towards racial and sexual equality in the \"great society\" era of the 60s. Alfred Ross, the IDS president, said yesterday: \"The growing role of the Federalist Society and other rightwing legal groups opens the door to populating the federal judiciary and administrative agencies with extremist ideologues who are determined to overthrow the legacy of social justice in America.\" Email julian.borger@theguardian.com Related special reports George Bush's America Gun violence in America Other articles More articles by Julian Borger Useful links Institute for Democracy Studies American Bar Association Federalist Society The Washington Post Arlington National cemetery Washington monument The Pentagon The White House Capitol Steps political satire Washington DC homepage",

He loyally accepted being sacked for being ahead of his time.</p> <p>His straightforwardness has always endeared him, not least during his recent career when he has tried to explain what was being done to correct the inadequacies of Britain's pensions systems. Despite the fact that the platform lost the vote, he won many plaudits for a rousing speech which closed the pensions debate during the last Labour conference. He has never tried to hide behind civil servants' obscurantisms when taking on his opponents, always preferring blunt simple language in his Brummie accent.</p> <p>It probably comes from not having been a lawyer. The son of a factory worker, he trained as a production engineer, working in various factories in and around Birmingham for 14 years before becoming a lecturer on the subject.</p> <p>Having won a Birmingham city council seat at 25 in 1967, he was selected for his natal, Tory-held Perry Barr four years later, and captured it in February 1974, thus helping to confirm Harold Wilson's second term as prime minister.</p> <p>He has always been a soft-left loner, willing to rebel against a Labour government or faction when he thinks them wrong. He was one of the first to attack Harold Wilson's 'Lavender List' of honours recommended for the business friends of his secretary, Marcia Williams, latterly Lady Falkender. With the late Audrey Wise, in 1977 he secured the Rooker-Wise amendment to the Finance Act, ensuring an increase in personal allowances in line with inflation. In 1980 he introduced a bill to abolish the House of Lords. Although on the left, he was one of the 30-odd soft-left MPs who abstained from voting for Tony Benn as deputy leader in 1981, preventing him from beating Denis Healey.</p> <p>Although he became a Treasury and environment spokesman, and once filled in for Tony Blair at PMQs, Mr Rooker's progress was limited by his aversion to factions and slates. When Labour won in 1997 he was named food safety minister under agriculture minister Jack Cunningham. The job was initially seen as a safe backwater for his outspokenness, but the BSE crisis soon raised his profile. His handling of this thorny issue and of GM planting made him a widely popular minor hero, acclaimed on all sides for his bravery. Even the Daily Telegraph's sketchwriter, Quentin Letts, praised him for having \"withstood criticism of the beef-on-the-bone ban where a weaker minister might have folded.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/person/0,9290,-4520,00.html\">Ask Aristotle about Jeff Rooker</a></p>",

Despite the fact that the platform lost the vote, he won many plaudits for a rousing speech which closed the pensions debate during the last Labour conference. He has never tried to hide behind civil servants' obscurantisms when taking on his opponents, always preferring blunt simple language in his Brummie accent. It probably comes from not having been a lawyer. The son of a factory worker, he trained as a production engineer, working in various factories in and around Birmingham for 14 years before becoming a lecturer on the subject. Having won a Birmingham city council seat at 25 in 1967, he was selected for his natal, Tory-held Perry Barr four years later, and captured it in February 1974, thus helping to confirm Harold Wilson's second term as prime minister. He has always been a soft-left loner, willing to rebel against a Labour government or faction when he thinks them wrong. He was one of the first to attack Harold Wilson's 'Lavender List' of honours recommended for the business friends of his secretary, Marcia Williams, latterly Lady Falkender. With the late Audrey Wise, in 1977 he secured the Rooker-Wise amendment to the Finance Act, ensuring an increase in personal allowances in line with inflation. In 1980 he introduced a bill to abolish the House of Lords. Although on the left, he was one of the 30-odd soft-left MPs who abstained from voting for Tony Benn as deputy leader in 1981, preventing him from beating Denis Healey. Although he became a Treasury and environment spokesman, and once filled in for Tony Blair at PMQs, Mr Rooker's progress was limited by his aversion to factions and slates. When Labour won in 1997 he was named food safety minister under agriculture minister Jack Cunningham. The job was initially seen as a safe backwater for his outspokenness, but the BSE crisis soon raised his profile. His handling of this thorny issue and of GM planting made him a widely popular minor hero, acclaimed on all sides for his bravery. Even the Daily Telegraph's sketchwriter, Quentin Letts, praised him for having \"withstood criticism of the beef-on-the-bone ban where a weaker minister might have folded.\" Ask Aristotle about Jeff Rooker",

The couple worked together for more than 30 years, and Thomas spent longer with Rank than any other director.</p> <p>What his younger brother, Gerald, was to the Carry On pictures, Ralph (pronounced \"Raaf\") was to the Doctor series. Starting with Doctor In the House (1954), most of them starred Dirk Bogarde, in his matin\u00e9e idol days, as a shy, young houseman up against his bombastic chief Sir Lance- lot Spratt (James Robertson Justice) and getting into trouble with various starlets.</p> <p>The rights to Richard Gordon's novel, Doctor In The House, had been available cheap for several months before Thomas and Box snapped them up, but the pair had a tough time convincing Rank executives that Bogarde could play light comedy. In the end, however, Bogarde starred in eight films directed by Thomas, whom he consid-ered a surrogate father.</p> <p>Thomas was born in Hull, the son of a Shell manager. He had planned to study law but, in 1932, joined the Bristol Evening World as a 17-year-old cub reporter. An article on Oscar Deutsch, of the Odeon cinema chain, brought him to the attention of Deutsch, who offered him work at his Sound City studios at Shepperton. It was the classic story; he started on 25 shillings a week as a clapper boy, and rose through the camera, sound, art and editing departments, and was cutting features before the second world war.</p> <p>Thomas, who had been in the 9th Lancers voluntary reserve, joined the armoured regiment when war was declared, and rose to the rank of major, being awarded the Military Cross. In 1946, he rejoined Rank, and his early trailers so impressed Sydney Box, a producer at Gainsborough's Islington studios, that he gave Thomas his first directing assignment in 1948.</p> <p>After a few minor films, Thomas joined forces with Sydney's sister, Betty, to make The Clouded Yellow (1950), an excellent man-on-the-run thriller, written by Eric Ambler and featuring Trevor Howard and Jean Simmons. Thomas again demonstrated his professionalism with Appointment With Venus (1951), set during the German occupation of the Channel Islands.</p> <p>In between the Doctor films, he directed a good stiff-upper-lip submarine war drama, Above Us The Waves (1955) with John Mills. In the following year, he had his hands full directing Katharine Hepburn and Bob Hope in the comedy The Iron Petticoat. Hope arrived at Pinewood with an entourage of gag writers, who immediately began rewriting the script, and Hepburn objected to playing his stooge.</p> <p>Thomas then honoured his promise to Bogarde to give him a break from the frivolities of St Swithin's hospital and provide him with more meaty roles: in Campbell's Kingdom (1957), a Canadian-set adventure; The Wind Cannot Read (1958), about a doomed love affair between a British officer and a Japanese girl in India; and A Tale Of Two Cities (1958), in which Bogarde was an effectively languid Sydney Carton. All were efficiently made on a bigger British budget, in a vain attempt to challenge Hollywood.</p> <p>Because the Technicolor remake of The 39 Steps (1959) was designed to fill a gap in the studio schedules, Thomas had only six weeks' preparation. There was no time to develop a fresh script, which is why it followed the 1935 Alfred Hitchcock version so closely. In fact, on its own terms, the film, starring Kenneth More, was pacey and entertaining.</p> <p>Probably the best film Thomas directed was Conspiracy Of Hearts (1960), a moving drama of courageous nuns sheltering Jewish children from the Nazis in Italy. This was followed by No Love For Johnny (1961), one of the few British films about politics, with Peter Finch as an ambitious Labour MP.</p> <p>By the early 1960s, however, Thomas's films began to seem quaint against the British new wave, which dealt vigor- ously with working-class life. Box and Thomas went on to provide the public with cheery comedies such as No, My Darling Daughter (1961) and A Pair of Briefs (1962). Bogarde, leaving his serious work with Joseph Losey, returned for a James Bond spoof, Hot Enough For June (1964), and The High Bright Sun (1965), a stodgy romance set in Cyprus. But he refused the last Doctor movie, Doctor In Clover (1966).</p> <p>Thomas transplanted the character of Bulldog Drummond to swinging London in Deadlier Than The Male (1966) and Some Girls Do (1968). The climax of his career came with Percy (1971) and Percy's Progress (1974), limp comedies about a penis transplant. By the 1970s, British cinema was fighting for its life, and he worked on several projects that never reached the screen. In the early 1980s, he wrote a dozen television scripts for the series Doctor's Daughters and was consultant on Doctor In The House.</p> <p>He is survived by Joy, his wife since 1944, their daughter Jill, who runs an animation film company, and son Jeremy, a film producer.</p> <p>Thomas once said: \"I'm not anxious to make films that have a message.

      "bodyText": "The BBC has snatched back the rights to UK's most prestigious arts awards, the Booker Prize for Fiction, from Channel 4. But the announcement immediately led to a row between the two broadcasters, with Channel 4 insisting it hadn't even bid for what is the most prestigious award in the literary calendar. A spokesman said Channel 4 had said in February it would no longer be covering the Booker. \"We wanted to change our coverage of literature,\" he said. But the BBC claimed it had started talking to the organisers of the literary awards before the end of last year about taking over the TV contract. \"They were talking to us long before Channel 4 said they didn't want it anymore,\" a BBC insider said. BBC2 will broadcast live coverage of this year's Booker dinner and awards ceremony in October, as well as a 60-minute preview documentary the weekend before. The BBC has also promised further Booker-related coverage on its radio, digital TV and online services as part of a three-year deal. \"As Britain's leading arts broadcaster, we aim to bring viewers and listeners the key events in the cultural calendar and the Booker is one of the most prestigious of all,\" said Roly Keating, BBC controller of arts commissioning and digital channels. A BBC spokeswoman said no decision had been taken about who would present the Booker show. Channel 4's coverage was presented by Sir Melvyn Bragg and Muriel Gray. The Channel 4 spokesman said it had decided to drop its Booker coverage because it already lined up a number of arts award-related shows in the autumn, including coverage of the Sterling prize for Architecture, the Turner prize for art and the new year one photography event. The broadcaster has also commissioned a 4 x 60-minute arts documentary series, to be produced by LWT and presented by Lord Bragg, on \"cultural ideas and literature\", which will go out at around the same time as the Booker, the spokesman added. TV coverage of the literary awards event was originally produced by LWT for Channel 4 until 1987, when the BBC took over for a 10-year stretch. While the Booker is one of the leading dates in the arts calendar, it has never brought in a big audience. Last year's Channel 4 show drew just 600,000 viewers and a 3% share of the audience between 8 and 9pm when it was aired in early November.",

Officials say the sense of betrayal is acute; Skopje overcame misgivings to help Nato during its campaign to oust Yugoslav forces from Kosovo. Thousands of Macedonians have demonstrated in front of the parliament in Skopje, accusing its government and the west of doing too little. A sense of events slipping out of control grew on Sunday night when the prime minister, Ljubco Georgievski, accused the west of breeding Europe's answer to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. He also claimed that Nato would not recognise that the guerrillas came from UN-administered Kosovo because that would be to admit failure.

Many clergy are furious at a decision by the holy synod, the Greek church's ruling body, to lift long-standing objections to what will be the first papal visit since the \"great schism\" of 1054 split Christianity into eastern and western branches. The ailing pontiff wants to make a flying visit to Athens in May as part of a millennial pilgrimage retracing the path of St Paul from Syria to Malta. He plans to offer symbolic prayers on the Hill of the Pnyx, an area of Athens to the west of the Acropolis where St Paul preached to the Athenians. Both liberal Orthodox members and the Vatican hope the visit will help to bridge the divide between the two churches. But Greece's conservative rank-and-file clergy, in the grip of a nationalist fervour fuelled by what many saw as western - read Catholic - aggression against fellow Orthodox Serbs during the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo, are urging a boycott. They are angry at Rome's perceived refusal to show \"humility and repentance\" and to apologise for centuries of alleged misdeeds against Orthodox Christians. Many in the Greek church view the fall of Constantinople at the hands of crusaders in 1204 as darkly as they do the siege of the city by Ottoman Turks in 1453 that led to the end of the Byzantine empire. The union of Greek clerics, which represents about 8,000 parish priests, warned of widespread protests and described the Pope as \"the arch-heretic\" and the \"grotesque two-horned monster of Rome\". It threatened a mass bell-ringing protest during the visit. In a petition last Friday to Archbishop Christodoulos, the leader of the Greek church, the country's monasteries said the visit would be divisive and \"scandalise the consciousness of the faithful\". Monks from the independent all-male community of Mount Athos, one of the most revered centres of Orthodoxy, also threatened to join the protests. The police and security services in Greece and at the Vatican have been alerted about the potential for trouble. Besides theological and political disputes with the Vatican, there are suspicions here that it is trying to poach Orthodox believers in eastern Europe. \"Some of our followers see the Pope as a latter-day Napoleon,\" Yiannis Hadjifotis, a former spokesman for the Church of Greece, said. The main targets of Orthodox fears are the Eastern Rite (or Uniate) churches, which follow Orthodox traditions but profess loyalty to the Pope. \"They are the Trojan horse of the Catholic church,\" an Orthodox bishop said. Only about 50,000 of Greece's 10.2m citizens are Roman Catholics - though there are thought to be some 200,000 Catholic worshippers among the growing immigrant population. The Catholic church in Greece welcomed the decision by Orthodox leaders to allow the visit but expressed concern at the rhetoric of its opponents. \"Conservative elements in the Orthodox church have very long memories,\" a spokesman said. \"His holiness has nothing to do with the wrongdoings of Catholics of the Middle Ages, for which we have apologised as a church.\" Attempts at reconciliation between the two churches have stalled in recent years, although in 1999 the Pope visited predominantly Orthodox Romania and Georgia. Vatican sources said last week that a visit to Athens could also influence the Russian Orthodox church, which has close links with the Greek church, and possibly pave the way for a historic trip to Moscow. The embattled leaders of the Greek church appealed to the faithful not to overreact to the Pope's visit. \"The faithful are called upon to trust their church leadership and not be led astray by distorted interpretations,\" the synod said. Orthodoxy is stipulated in the Greek constitution as the \"prevailing\" one, and the Orthodox church wields significant political and economic influence. The outspoken Archbishop Christodoulos has been engaged in a bitter battle with the Socialist government over plans to remove the statement of religion from state identity cards.

      "body": "<p>Tory delegates at the 2000 conference should have been provided with a couch for shadow chancellor Michael Portillo's voyage around his psyche. Never has a major political figure so lived up to the words, \"To thine own self be true\".</p> <p>Mr Portillo's voyage of rediscovery was all the more wondrous since everyone was able to witness the shock that pushed him into the political abyss. He lost his \"super-safe\" Tory seat to Stephen Twigg, a gay Blairite stripling. That helped Mr Portillo confront his own exotic background on the BBC as the son of an exiled Spanish republican intellectual and a Kirkcaldy Liberal Democrat teacher.</p> <p>The resultant catharsis has had political repercussions. Mr Portillo made his comeback for affluent Kensington and Chelsea mainly because they saw him as a \"son of Thatcher\". But that is not how he has reinvented himself. In the u-turns he has imposed on his leader William Hague as his \"loyal\" shadow chancellor Mr Portillo has emerged as a centre-right inclusivist, in contrast to authoritarian-right Ann Widdecombe, his rival for the succession should William Hague falter.</p> <p>To win that battle, Mr Portillo will need all his subtlety. He must not appear to be disloyal so as to avoid the Tory \"traitor\" tag which bedevilled Michael Heseltine. He must also help unmask the insanities of rival Miss Widdecombe without showing his hand, as happened when the Mail on Sunday found seven fellow shadow cabinet members anxious to confess their youthful cannabis experiments. Mr Portillo himself did not say whether he had tried cannabis but he has admitted to trying homosexuality in his university years.</p> <p>Mr Portillo's need for subtlety must be frustrating because his party has moved into the far-right positions he abandoned after his 1997 election defeat. Tory MPs are already three-quarters Eurosceptic rightists.</p> <p>The one thing Mr Portillo knows intimately is the ethos of allegiance change. Born in Bushey in 1953, he was a keen supporter of Harold Wilson while at Harrow County grammar school. He was converted to Conservatism at Peterhouse, Cambridge University, by the rightwing guru, Maurice Cowling, who also recommended him for his job as a researcher at Conservative central office.</p> <p>His ambition was enormous. In 1983 he contested Perry Barr, Birmingham against Jeff Rooker, who increased his majority ninefold. As an adviser, he continued to push for the privatisation of British Gas and the deregulation of bus transport, serving Cecil Parkinson, the then trade and industry secretary.</p> <p>His luck was phenomenal, as demonstrated by the IRA Brighton conference bomb. Mr Portillo left the Grand Hotel an hour before the bomb exploded and was then selected from more than 200 aspirants for the byelection caused by the death of Southgate MP, Sir Anthony Berry, who was killed by the bomb.</p> <p>From his maiden speech, he crusaded against high taxation and for freeing nationalised monopolies. He backed bills against abortion and favouring capital punishment. A parliamentary private secretary to John Moore and an assistant whip by 1986, his 1987 re-election campaign attracted the support of lobbyist Ian Greer.</p> <p>An under secretary for social security from 1987, he withdrew benefit entitlement from unemployed school leavers who refused to join youth training schemes. He also scrapped the social fund which provided grants and loans to the poor and curbed the benefit system and new personal and occupational pensions, claiming previous systems had encouraged people to \"live off the state\".</p> <p>As a reward, he was promoted minister of public transport, offsetting moderate transport secretary Paul Channon. Mr Portillo excluded British Rail from his effort to build the Channel tunnel with private funds and pushed local authorities to dispose of bus enterprises. He urged on Mrs Thatcher the privatisation of British Rail and the tube.</p> <p>By 1990 he was being mentioned by Norman Tebbit as a possible future Tory leader and he sought Mrs Thatcher's approval by taking over the poll tax as local government minister, telling her, \"There is nothing in the whole world I would rather do.\" He despaired when she wanted to step down in 1990, brushing aside Mrs Thatcher's permanent private secretary, Sir Peter Morrison, when he tried to ban him from dissuading her.</p> <p>His 1992 appointment to the cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury was taken to mean that prime minister John Major was serious about cutting expenditure - Mr Portillo promptly cut funds for inner cities. But he was discreet in expressing his Euroscepticism and also voted, in February 1994, against reducing to 16 the age of homosexual consent.</p> <p>His extreme caution was again shown when he refused to challenge John Major for leadership of the party in June 1995, even on the joint ticket offered by John Redwood, although his ally John Whittingdale set up an office and battery of telephones to do so. His reward, promotion to defence secretary, brought out his worst expression of super-patriotism, including his chauvinist \"Who Dares Wins\" speech which wowed only the 1995 Tory conference. He enthused the right but infuriated gays by refusing to allow them to serve in the forces.</p> <p>Between his defeat in May 1997 and his re-entry into parliament for Kensington and Chelsea in November 1999, he managed to swivel his position from hard-right to centre-right. He even managed to confess to his earlier homosexuality, although his former lover, Nigel Hart, insisted he had been economical with the truth. Mr Hart recalls Mr Portillo saying: \"I've just worked out that the first time I slept with you was the day after I slept with [my future wife] Carolyn for the first time.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/person/0,9290,-4231,00.html\">Ask Aristotle about Michael Portillo</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Tory delegates at the 2000 conference should have been provided with a couch for shadow chancellor Michael Portillo's voyage around his psyche. Never has a major political figure so lived up to the words, \"To thine own self be true\". Mr Portillo's voyage of rediscovery was all the more wondrous since everyone was able to witness the shock that pushed him into the political abyss. He lost his \"super-safe\" Tory seat to Stephen Twigg, a gay Blairite stripling. That helped Mr Portillo confront his own exotic background on the BBC as the son of an exiled Spanish republican intellectual and a Kirkcaldy Liberal Democrat teacher. The resultant catharsis has had political repercussions. Mr Portillo made his comeback for affluent Kensington and Chelsea mainly because they saw him as a \"son of Thatcher\". But that is not how he has reinvented himself. In the u-turns he has imposed on his leader William Hague as his \"loyal\" shadow chancellor Mr Portillo has emerged as a centre-right inclusivist, in contrast to authoritarian-right Ann Widdecombe, his rival for the succession should William Hague falter. To win that battle, Mr Portillo will need all his subtlety. He must not appear to be disloyal so as to avoid the Tory \"traitor\" tag which bedevilled Michael Heseltine. He must also help unmask the insanities of rival Miss Widdecombe without showing his hand, as happened when the Mail on Sunday found seven fellow shadow cabinet members anxious to confess their youthful cannabis experiments. Mr Portillo himself did not say whether he had tried cannabis but he has admitted to trying homosexuality in his university years. Mr Portillo's need for subtlety must be frustrating because his party has moved into the far-right positions he abandoned after his 1997 election defeat. Tory MPs are already three-quarters Eurosceptic rightists. The one thing Mr Portillo knows intimately is the ethos of allegiance change. Born in Bushey in 1953, he was a keen supporter of Harold Wilson while at Harrow County grammar school. He was converted to Conservatism at Peterhouse, Cambridge University, by the rightwing guru, Maurice Cowling, who also recommended him for his job as a researcher at Conservative central office. His ambition was enormous. In 1983 he contested Perry Barr, Birmingham against Jeff Rooker, who increased his majority ninefold. As an adviser, he continued to push for the privatisation of British Gas and the deregulation of bus transport, serving Cecil Parkinson, the then trade and industry secretary. His luck was phenomenal, as demonstrated by the IRA Brighton conference bomb. Mr Portillo left the Grand Hotel an hour before the bomb exploded and was then selected from more than 200 aspirants for the byelection caused by the death of Southgate MP, Sir Anthony Berry, who was killed by the bomb. From his maiden speech, he crusaded against high taxation and for freeing nationalised monopolies. He backed bills against abortion and favouring capital punishment. A parliamentary private secretary to John Moore and an assistant whip by 1986, his 1987 re-election campaign attracted the support of lobbyist Ian Greer. An under secretary for social security from 1987, he withdrew benefit entitlement from unemployed school leavers who refused to join youth training schemes. He also scrapped the social fund which provided grants and loans to the poor and curbed the benefit system and new personal and occupational pensions, claiming previous systems had encouraged people to \"live off the state\". As a reward, he was promoted minister of public transport, offsetting moderate transport secretary Paul Channon. Mr Portillo excluded British Rail from his effort to build the Channel tunnel with private funds and pushed local authorities to dispose of bus enterprises. He urged on Mrs Thatcher the privatisation of British Rail and the tube. By 1990 he was being mentioned by Norman Tebbit as a possible future Tory leader and he sought Mrs Thatcher's approval by taking over the poll tax as local government minister, telling her, \"There is nothing in the whole world I would rather do.\" He despaired when she wanted to step down in 1990, brushing aside Mrs Thatcher's permanent private secretary, Sir Peter Morrison, when he tried to ban him from dissuading her. His 1992 appointment to the cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury was taken to mean that prime minister John Major was serious about cutting expenditure - Mr Portillo promptly cut funds for inner cities. But he was discreet in expressing his Euroscepticism and also voted, in February 1994, against reducing to 16 the age of homosexual consent. His extreme caution was again shown when he refused to challenge John Major for leadership of the party in June 1995, even on the joint ticket offered by John Redwood, although his ally John Whittingdale set up an office and battery of telephones to do so. His reward, promotion to defence secretary, brought out his worst expression of super-patriotism, including his chauvinist \"Who Dares Wins\" speech which wowed only the 1995 Tory conference. He enthused the right but infuriated gays by refusing to allow them to serve in the forces. Between his defeat in May 1997 and his re-entry into parliament for Kensington and Chelsea in November 1999, he managed to swivel his position from hard-right to centre-right. He even managed to confess to his earlier homosexuality, although his former lover, Nigel Hart, insisted he had been economical with the truth. Mr Hart recalls Mr Portillo saying: \"I've just worked out that the first time I slept with you was the day after I slept with [my future wife] Carolyn for the first time.\" Ask Aristotle about Michael Portillo",

      "body": "<p>Gathering dust in a Harvard archive is a document every BBC employee should read. Because Greg Dyke loves it.<strong> Janine Gibson</strong> and <strong>Maggie Brown</strong> reveal its mystery author, a man at the DG's right hand with job losses on his mind </p> <p>The most remarkable thing about the leaks of Greg Dyke's blueprint for the new BBC last week was not the headline figure 1,000 jobs to go nor the news that some of the corporation's longest-serving executives might soon be getting their coats. The truly amazing thing was that the BBC, one of the leakiest organisations ever, had managed to keep it quiet for so long. </p> <p>So why did some of the greatest gossips in a notoriously gossipy industry fail to reveal the secret plan emerging from Dyke's review of the corporation, which began when he joined in the autumn? Simple: they didn't know. In fact, no one knew. They still don't. </p> <p>It didn't stop them speculating. 'Isn't it incredible,' gasped one of the BBC's most acclaimed programme makers, 'how everything that Birt has done is being swept away? It's as if he's never been.' </p> <p>A note from Dyke, sent to every member of staff on Thursday after the trade magazine Broadcast splashed on the story, was confiding and reassuring, while still failing either to deny the reports or unveil the plan. Affectionately signed 'yours, Greg' it described the story as speculation and reminded staff that he would announce his plans in a couple of weeks. </p> <p>So with staff none the wiser, the rumour mill went into overdrive. And the name on the lips of those who know enough to know how little they know was Gareth Jones, the BBC's new director of human resources and legal affairs. Professor Jones, who joined the corporation in November to replace Margaret Salmon, was Dyke's first senior appointment. A former colleague of the new DG, he is something of a mystery to the broadcasting types. Aged 39, he was professor of organisational development at Henley Management college, where he was known for his skills in helping managers effect wide-scale cultural change in their organisations. </p> <p>This is his speciality, honed with companies including Polygram International and at academic institutions including the University of East Anglia, the London Business school and the voguish French business school, Insead. </p> <p>Happily, there is an insight into Jones's thinking on the difficulties of changing a company's culture. Gathering dust in the archive of the Harvard Business Review, an illustrious publication, is an article authored by the mastermind behind Dyke's plans. In 1996, along with Rob Goffee then an LBS professor Jones wrote What Holds the Modern Company Together. It is a key report. </p> <p>The article shows the influences behind Dyke's plan the massive cultural sea change he wants to effect, removing the endless managers and helping BBC staff to have fun again. It also shows the motivation behind his 'put up or shut up' speech to staff when he formally took over, when he told them to leave if they didn't like it. Jones's model would not tolerate creative types bitching about the job instead of doing it. </p> <p>Jones's theory is built on the twin virtues of 'sociability' and 'solidarity', which can be combined in varying ratios to achieve various ends. There is no single ideal, according to this theory, and different models can work in different areas. A 'mercenary' culture can work for a highly competitive, sales-driven organisation where employees expect to work very hard for vast rewards and early retirement. However, for the BBC, it seems the 'communal' model, where sociability and solidarity meet harmoniously, would be the ideal. </p> <p>Four years ago, Jones and Goffee described the BBC as undergoing an 'uncomfortable transition'. As Birt tried to focus the corporation on efficiency and productivity dividing producers from broadcasters and establishing the internal market the BBC became fragmented, they wrote. </p> <p>'With its communal culture heading toward a fragmented one, the BBC faces no alternative but to invent itself,' they concluded. How does an organisation change its culture? Jones and Goffee offered a series of steps: promote the sharing of ideas, arrange casual gatherings, reduce formality, limit hierarchical differences, 'act like a friend', create a sense of urgency and stimulate the will to win. </p> <p>But, they warned, 'before attempting to change levels of sociability or solidarity, a manager needs to think a bit like a doctor taking on a new patient. The patient's past and current condition are not only relevant but also critically important to assessing the best future treatment'. A questionnaire is provided, with which to assess your organisation's culture, with statements such as 'people here do favours for one other because they like one another' to which the responses are either 'low, medium or high'. One BBC staffer simply burst out laughing in response to that question last week. </p> <p>Some degree of choosiness will no doubt be appropriate when selecting the BBC's future tactics from the list. Limiting hierarchical differences and redesigning the organisational chart one of the five recommendations for increasing sociability is clearly well under way. Introducing an annual company picnic might not be wholly welcomed. So far, Dyke's grand plan to turn the BBC into a more productive and happy place has been painted as a slaughter of hundreds of top and middle managers, who will find themselves competing for a vastly reduced number of posts. And that slaughter will happen it will be vital to meet the promised target of reducing spending on administration from 24% of the BBC's total income to a justifiable 15%. </p> <p>But the real shock to the BBC system will not be the erasure of the current divisions between producers and broadcasters, nor the redistribution of budgets, nor even the rumoured move of Alan Yentob from director of television. According to those who have spoken to Jones, whose touchy-feely style involves chats with key executives over pints of beer, it will be the culture change that is intended to create an effective atmosphere. </p> <p>The Dyke team want to create a fast-reacting organisation, where programme makers feel valued, and where ideas and creative juices flow freely. They want the new departments to be 'small and specialist', reasoning that this is how programme makers work best. </p> <p>It's no accident that one of the few decisions made in the period of wait ing for the blueprint has been an acceptance that the new digital channels BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge can move into a loft-style office in Mortimer Street, central London, far from the tentacles of the 'big brother' BBC Television Centre, in White City, west London. </p> <p>A further symptom of the new style is Dyke's much commented-upon dislike of lengthy paper policy documents he refuses to read them and a desire for a much better system of internal communication. Nothing is sacred even the role of Ariel, the BBC's Pravda-like internal weekly newspaper, previously deemed essential for the dissemination of Birtspeak, is up for debate. </p> <p>For many programme makers, the term BBC was associated with Birt and the corporate centre: it was an institution they might have belonged to, but from which they felt alienated. The policy of sending favoured managers off to expensive business school courses at Wharton in the US or Insead is being stopped. So, probably, is the exclusive link with the University of Bradford, which runs a BBC management scheme. The aim is to create a BBC scheme, drawing on the best of business courses. </p> <p>Dyke's team have also been appalled by the civil service feel of the BBC, evidenced by fusty old-fashioned practices such as 'boarding' applicants for 'posts' rather than holding interviews for jobs. The new brooms shake their heads at the quaint idea that staff 'go on annual leave' instead of holidays. </p> <p>One trusted aide last week said the bottom line was simple. 'What does all this mean for Mrs Smith on her sofa? More money to be spent on better programmes. That's it.' Or as another remarks: 'The key thing is for the BBC to deliver stonking good programmes to the public, and everything else stands in the way of that.' </p> <p>But the hushed tones and enforced secrecy surrounding Dyke's blueprint cause some old hands to cite the mark of Birt. Carolyn Reynolds, one of the executives trusted to write the plan, is a former McKinsey consultant who joined BBC Worldwide. Robin Foster, who assisted, went on extended leave the moment the blueprint was handed over. 'I'm surprised Dyke hasn't issued a consultation plan. That's what ought to happen,' said a critic. </p> <p>The expressed fear is that the change will be so sharp and swift that a further shakedown will be needed in 18 months. The great variation in the predictions of job losses comes from the estimates made by those informed of the outline plan. Though several hundred will go at first, Dyke will not immediately lay down targets for further restructuring within the 16 new departments. That will be left to their new heads. </p> <p>The programme makers should have nothing to worry about save any personal aversion to company picnics and the like, but of course the waiting seems endless. As one key senior executive said last week, 'I've put all my plans on hold until I know what the final version is.' </p> <p>For, in a period of great change, there are countless tales of people rushing to grab territory and rubbish old rivals or enemies. Some of the governors are thought to be unnerved by the thought of their director-general line-managing 16 separate departments. Some staff are running a book on who will be the first senior manager to go. Whatever Dyke promises about his all-new BBC, it's not all sweetness and light.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The downturn in the US economy has hit one of the country's most unashamedly extravagant events, the Oscars, as advertisers shun Hollywood's annual shindig. The Academy Awards are second only to the Superbowl in the US advertising calendar and the country's biggest advertisers have traditionally chosen to premier their new campaigns during the annual broadcast. While the male-dominated Superbowl is the Holy Grail for car and beer companies, the female-oriented Oscars are the highlight of the year for cosmetics and hair-care advertisers. But this year, ABC, which broadcasts the awards, is struggling to persuade advertisers to pay the usual premium. Many slots for this Sunday's broadcast are still unsold and ABC has slashed the price of a 30-second slot by almost a third to \u00a3660,000. Cosmetics company Revlon is among the major US advertisers to have said it will not advertise during the awards. The company said it had abandoned the tradition to \"manage expenses\" and that it was looking at \"smarter\" ways of spending the money. The average price for a 30-second commercial during the Superbowl was \u00a31.35m, down slightly from \u00a31.39m in 2000. As recently as last month, ABC was optimistically claiming the average price of a 30-second slot would rise slightly, from \u00a3860,000 to \u00a3920,000. This was because the network had signed deals with many of its regular advertisers months ago, before the economic slowdown began to bite. Unlike the Superbowl, which moves from network to network, the Academy Awards have been broadcast on ABC since 1976. This means the network has long-term deals with advertisers, making the price of advertising less volatile. But if ABC has to sell of its remaining slots at rock-bottom prices - as now looks likely - its regular advertisers will think twice about paying the full whack next time round.

      "body": "<p>It was going to broaden the post-16 academic diet, increase choice for sixth-formers and raise standards. But Curriculum 2000, in place for just six months, has already run into problems. </p> <p>Sixth-formers are typically working 50- and 60-hour weeks to keep up with the demands of the new courses. And, as the exam season approaches, schools, too, are feeling the strain. This summer they will have to run three virtually simultaneous sets of exams - GCSEs, AS-levels and A-levels. Already stretched by teacher shortages and threatened industrial action, many schools will be forced to use local halls and buy in exam supervisors, and all face a huge bill from examboards. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Key Skills, the government's flagship programme to meet the needs of industry, and a core component of Curriculum 2000, has been declared \"a complete disaster\" by Dr Ken Spores at London's Institute of Education, who has been evaluating the Curriculum 2000 reforms as part of a research study for the Nuffield Foundation. And as if that wasn't damning enough, his research has also shown that most sixth-formers are not choosing a wider range of subjects than before - thus undermining the very basis of the project. </p> <p>Curriculum 2000 was the result of the Dearing Report into post-16 education, published in 1998. The report criticised the fact that a sixth-former in England studying A-levels typically had 15-18 hours of taught time a week, compared with up to 30 hours in France or Germany. Moreover the A-level, despite being admired for its rigour, represents early specialisation. In Europe young people study much broader-based qualifications such as France's baccalaureate. </p> <p>Ministers were keen for English students to experience the same broad diet, with a mix of arts and sciences. \"Students should be able to undertake more than three subjects in the first year of the sixth form,\" said Baroness Blackstone when the changes were first announced. In addition, \"key skills should be more widely taught - industry increasingly requires students with better understanding of communication, maths and IT.\" </p> <p>So Curriculum 2000 was launched, and this year's lower sixth became guinea pigs again. This age group was the first to experience the national cur riculum, the first to sit tests at 7 and 14, the first to experience target-led teaching. They are now expected to study up to five subjects for a year at the new AS-level. The new Advanced Subsidiary Level is a qualification in its own right. At the end of the first year of sixth form, students will take their AS-level exams, before dropping back to the traditional three subjects in their second, A-level, year. </p> <p>But Dr Spores, who has surveyed a large number of schools and colleges for Nuffield research has found that the new courses are so demanding that hardly any students are opting for five subjects. And despite the expectation that 17-year-olds would study a mix of arts and sciences, the Nuffield research has also found that choice appears to be following traditional patterns, with students choosing subjects that reflect their strengths. \"Students are not adopting a baccalaureate pattern,\" says Spores. </p> <p>Nathan Dippie certainly isn't. Although he is one of the minority who is doing five subjects at AS-level, they are a fairly predictable mix: physics, chemistry, biology, maths and geography. He has taken the unusual step of studying five subjects because he's undecided about his future, torn between medicine and an interest in geophysics. His AS-level choice keeps both options open, but at a price. </p> <p>\"I get no free study time at college,\" says the 16-year-old from Shropshire. \"And I get about 15 hours a week of homework. I've got a part-time job and I try to have a social life. I'm an actor with a local theatre company and I dance, which involves three visits a week to the dance studio. It's extremely difficult to juggle all of this. I come in at 10pm from dance class and I know that there is two and a half hours of school work to be done. Most nights I don't get to bed until midnight or 1am.\" </p> <p>Even in the independent sector most students have been advised to limit themselves to four subjects. Dulwich College in south London is a prestigious independent school with an excellent reputation. At A-level the school averages nearly 25 points per candidate, but sixth-formers are typically studying four AS-levels. </p> <p>\"I'm doing English, history, French and theatre studies,\" says 17-year-old Toby Ross, who attends the school. \"Most people are only doing four.\" Toby is coping well, but at the expense of other things. \"It would be nice if there was more time for things like school plays,\" he says. \"I wanted to direct something this summer, but there's no time.\" </p> <p>Lutterworth Upper School, in Leicestershire, has 700 sixth-formers, making it one of the largest state sixth forms in the country; it has an excellent reputation. The head, Chris Henstock, broadly supports Curriculum 2000. \"Fundamentally I believe in the changes,\" he says. \"At my school there are more kids doing a variety of subjects.\" But he is also concerned about the knock-on effects of the workload. </p> <p>\"We used to run a community involvement programme,\" he explains. \"But students aren't putting themselves forward. Short courses in Japanese, archaeology, astronomy, business French hare been squeezed out. A lot of these led to a qualification, but the school can no longer afford them and the students no longer have the time.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, at the highly academic King Edwards Handsworth Grammar School for Girls in Birmingham, Elspeth Insch OBE is another head teacher with mixed feelings about the reforms. </p> <p>\"The lower sixth appears to be working harder than sixth-formers have ever worked in the past and in some ways I'm happy about that,\" she say. \"But my girls get just seven free periods a fortnight - there isn't much free time.\" </p> <p>Most of the King Edwards girls are following four subjects, but even so curriculum enrichment programmes such as the school's community service provision have been hard hit. </p> <p>\"Our girls used to hear children read at local primary schools. Very few have the time for that now.\" Insch is also worried about the effect on her staff. \"The extra subject represents a 25% increase in workload across the board and it has added to classroom numbers, which were already too big. The marking load is horrific.\" </p> <p>And this isn't all. Many sixth formers are also studying for the new Key Skills qualification. This covers three of the generic skills which the government thinks individuals need in order to be effective members of the workforce: communication (written and oral), application of number (numeracy by any other name), and information technology. </p> <p>\"Key Skills is a disaster,\" argues Dr Spores. \"The kids don't like it and teachers think the delivery and assess ment of the course is too complicated.\" </p> <p>The new course has certainly resulted in some bizarre situations. High-fliers who got A* at GCSE in English or maths are being told they have to do the programme, and computer buffs who have produced websites are being put though programmes of basic IT. </p> <p>\"We complained,\" said one group of further education students at Stourbridge College in the West Midlands. \"We said the course was a complete waste of time, but we were told that Key Skills was compulsory.\" </p> <p>In fact, Key Skills is not compulsory, but schools and colleges are under intense pressure to persuade students to take the course because they have been funded to provide it, and inspectors will want to see that the money has been spent. And yet the Nuffield research has found virtually nobody with a good word for the new course, not even the employers it was introduced to please. </p> <p>Stourbridge is certainly aware of the strength of feeling about Key Skills. \"It has been an issue this year,\" says college principal Sadie Walton. \"I know that staff and students are unhappy about the programme.We know we need to get this right for students. If we don't they'll vote with their feet.\" </p> <p>There is already anecdotal evidence that some colleges are experiencing a higher drop-out rate this year, as a result of the Curriculum 2000 package. For many less able students, it seems, the pressure is simply too much. It seems ironic that a reform intended to broaden the 16-19 experience could be having the opposite effect. What's more, sixth formers have effectively lost a term of tuition - instead of attending classes in the summer term of the lower sixth, they are taking exams. </p> <p>Ken Spores emphasises the ongoing nature of the Nuffield research - definitive findings aren't expected for some months. He is broadly supportive of the new curriculum, but argues that ministers need to urgently rethink aspects of the reforms. </p> <p>\"There are gains,\" he said. \"The new arrangements offer some additional breadth, but we may have lost some of the enrichment elements of the old curriculum.

      "bodyText": "It was going to broaden the post-16 academic diet, increase choice for sixth-formers and raise standards. But Curriculum 2000, in place for just six months, has already run into problems. Sixth-formers are typically working 50- and 60-hour weeks to keep up with the demands of the new courses. And, as the exam season approaches, schools, too, are feeling the strain. This summer they will have to run three virtually simultaneous sets of exams - GCSEs, AS-levels and A-levels. Already stretched by teacher shortages and threatened industrial action, many schools will be forced to use local halls and buy in exam supervisors, and all face a huge bill from examboards. Meanwhile, Key Skills, the government's flagship programme to meet the needs of industry, and a core component of Curriculum 2000, has been declared \"a complete disaster\" by Dr Ken Spores at London's Institute of Education, who has been evaluating the Curriculum 2000 reforms as part of a research study for the Nuffield Foundation. And as if that wasn't damning enough, his research has also shown that most sixth-formers are not choosing a wider range of subjects than before - thus undermining the very basis of the project. Curriculum 2000 was the result of the Dearing Report into post-16 education, published in 1998. The report criticised the fact that a sixth-former in England studying A-levels typically had 15-18 hours of taught time a week, compared with up to 30 hours in France or Germany. Moreover the A-level, despite being admired for its rigour, represents early specialisation. In Europe young people study much broader-based qualifications such as France's baccalaureate. Ministers were keen for English students to experience the same broad diet, with a mix of arts and sciences. \"Students should be able to undertake more than three subjects in the first year of the sixth form,\" said Baroness Blackstone when the changes were first announced. In addition, \"key skills should be more widely taught - industry increasingly requires students with better understanding of communication, maths and IT.\" So Curriculum 2000 was launched, and this year's lower sixth became guinea pigs again. This age group was the first to experience the national cur riculum, the first to sit tests at 7 and 14, the first to experience target-led teaching. They are now expected to study up to five subjects for a year at the new AS-level. The new Advanced Subsidiary Level is a qualification in its own right. At the end of the first year of sixth form, students will take their AS-level exams, before dropping back to the traditional three subjects in their second, A-level, year. But Dr Spores, who has surveyed a large number of schools and colleges for Nuffield research has found that the new courses are so demanding that hardly any students are opting for five subjects. And despite the expectation that 17-year-olds would study a mix of arts and sciences, the Nuffield research has also found that choice appears to be following traditional patterns, with students choosing subjects that reflect their strengths. \"Students are not adopting a baccalaureate pattern,\" says Spores. Nathan Dippie certainly isn't. Although he is one of the minority who is doing five subjects at AS-level, they are a fairly predictable mix: physics, chemistry, biology, maths and geography. He has taken the unusual step of studying five subjects because he's undecided about his future, torn between medicine and an interest in geophysics. His AS-level choice keeps both options open, but at a price. \"I get no free study time at college,\" says the 16-year-old from Shropshire. \"And I get about 15 hours a week of homework. I've got a part-time job and I try to have a social life. I'm an actor with a local theatre company and I dance, which involves three visits a week to the dance studio. It's extremely difficult to juggle all of this. I come in at 10pm from dance class and I know that there is two and a half hours of school work to be done. Most nights I don't get to bed until midnight or 1am.\" Even in the independent sector most students have been advised to limit themselves to four subjects. Dulwich College in south London is a prestigious independent school with an excellent reputation. At A-level the school averages nearly 25 points per candidate, but sixth-formers are typically studying four AS-levels. \"I'm doing English, history, French and theatre studies,\" says 17-year-old Toby Ross, who attends the school. \"Most people are only doing four.\" Toby is coping well, but at the expense of other things. \"It would be nice if there was more time for things like school plays,\" he says. \"I wanted to direct something this summer, but there's no time.\" Lutterworth Upper School, in Leicestershire, has 700 sixth-formers, making it one of the largest state sixth forms in the country; it has an excellent reputation. The head, Chris Henstock, broadly supports Curriculum 2000. \"Fundamentally I believe in the changes,\" he says. \"At my school there are more kids doing a variety of subjects.\" But he is also concerned about the knock-on effects of the workload. \"We used to run a community involvement programme,\" he explains. \"But students aren't putting themselves forward. Short courses in Japanese, archaeology, astronomy, business French hare been squeezed out. A lot of these led to a qualification, but the school can no longer afford them and the students no longer have the time.\" Meanwhile, at the highly academic King Edwards Handsworth Grammar School for Girls in Birmingham, Elspeth Insch OBE is another head teacher with mixed feelings about the reforms. \"The lower sixth appears to be working harder than sixth-formers have ever worked in the past and in some ways I'm happy about that,\" she say. \"But my girls get just seven free periods a fortnight - there isn't much free time.\" Most of the King Edwards girls are following four subjects, but even so curriculum enrichment programmes such as the school's community service provision have been hard hit. \"Our girls used to hear children read at local primary schools. Very few have the time for that now.\" Insch is also worried about the effect on her staff. \"The extra subject represents a 25% increase in workload across the board and it has added to classroom numbers, which were already too big. The marking load is horrific.\" And this isn't all. Many sixth formers are also studying for the new Key Skills qualification. This covers three of the generic skills which the government thinks individuals need in order to be effective members of the workforce: communication (written and oral), application of number (numeracy by any other name), and information technology. \"Key Skills is a disaster,\" argues Dr Spores. \"The kids don't like it and teachers think the delivery and assess ment of the course is too complicated.\" The new course has certainly resulted in some bizarre situations. High-fliers who got A* at GCSE in English or maths are being told they have to do the programme, and computer buffs who have produced websites are being put though programmes of basic IT. \"We complained,\" said one group of further education students at Stourbridge College in the West Midlands. \"We said the course was a complete waste of time, but we were told that Key Skills was compulsory.\" In fact, Key Skills is not compulsory, but schools and colleges are under intense pressure to persuade students to take the course because they have been funded to provide it, and inspectors will want to see that the money has been spent. And yet the Nuffield research has found virtually nobody with a good word for the new course, not even the employers it was introduced to please. Stourbridge is certainly aware of the strength of feeling about Key Skills. \"It has been an issue this year,\" says college principal Sadie Walton. \"I know that staff and students are unhappy about the programme.We know we need to get this right for students. If we don't they'll vote with their feet.\" There is already anecdotal evidence that some colleges are experiencing a higher drop-out rate this year, as a result of the Curriculum 2000 package. For many less able students, it seems, the pressure is simply too much. It seems ironic that a reform intended to broaden the 16-19 experience could be having the opposite effect. What's more, sixth formers have effectively lost a term of tuition - instead of attending classes in the summer term of the lower sixth, they are taking exams. Ken Spores emphasises the ongoing nature of the Nuffield research - definitive findings aren't expected for some months. He is broadly supportive of the new curriculum, but argues that ministers need to urgently rethink aspects of the reforms. \"There are gains,\" he said. \"The new arrangements offer some additional breadth, but we may have lost some of the enrichment elements of the old curriculum. The pace of work is frantic at AS-level and the Key Skills programme is in deep trouble.\" phil.revell@ukonline.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "British children are not properly protected from paedophiles on the internet, a Home Office-sponsored report says today. The Internet Crime Forum - who represent police, social workers, the internet industry and civil liberties groups - spent nearly two years examining cases of abuse of children through the net. The study - called \"Chat Wise, Street Wise - children and internet chat rooms\" - urges a review of the law to tackle adults who target children for abuse on the internet. Numerous examples of abusers \"grooming\" children, often through winning their confidence by pretending to be teenagers in online chat rooms, were looked at. Although it does not call for a sweeping reform of the law, it does recommend internet service providers set up \"safe haven\" spaces within their domains. It also calls for cyber police to monitor the areas, and some form of \"kitemark\" to reassure parents the sites were safe. Children and parents are also to be given advice on net etiquette, such as never giving out email or home addresses, their phone number or details about which school they attend. A special police hotline will also be set up for parents to report suspected cases of grooming. More than 5m children under 16 in the UK are online, with 1.15m admitting to using chat rooms. There are thought to be around 100,000 chat rooms on the web. The report - which will now go to the home secretary, Jack Straw, for consideration - comes as concern over the safety of children on the net grows in the UK. London's Saatchi gallery was forced to defend an exhitibition of photographs containing pictures of naked children after an expose in a Sunday tabloid newspaper. The paper claimed the photographs had already been posted on child porn sites on the web. More than 2,000 men in the USA have been convicted of internet sex offences in the past six years - but prosecutions are more rare in the UK as defence barristers can argue any police operation constitutes entrapment. Last year one of the designers of the Lara Croft computer game, Kenneth Lockley, was jailed for 18 months after trying to incite an undercover police officer to lure child for sex.

The precautionary slaughter of a herd of sheep in South Hinksey, just south of Oxford, will mean a redrawing of the boundaries of restricted areas, where there is held to be high risk of infection. The detail is still unclear, but the new boundary could be within five miles of the town. It could even be on the very edge of Mill Farm at Church Enstone, a few minutes' drive away.</p> <p><b>The farmer</b></p> <p>Marilyn Ivings, who has 35 suckler cows at Mill Farm, received notification of the new precautions from the ministry, just before Guardian Unlimited called.</p> <p>\"I haven't worked it out yet, but it could mean that our boundary will also be the boundary of the new restricted area. It makes your tummy go all tight, just thinking about it,\" she said.</p> <p>In practical terms, the likely new restrictions will not make a huge difference: the animals are not due to leave the farm until much later in the year, and they are already prevented from going to their normal grazing, by the prohibition on animal movement. For the moment, then, they are staying exactly where they are, free to roam the immediate area of the farm by day, and shut up indoors by night.</p> <p>Marilyn and her husband Ted are also doing what they can to keep out foot and mouth, with a lengthy straw bed soaked with disinfectant at the farm entrance, and further supplies of disinfectant to treat boots.</p> <p>With the disease apparently creeping closer, it is all they can do. \"It's a bit like trying to put out a fire with a bottle of pop, I suppose, but we have to do what we can,\" said Marilyn. She is deeply concerned about the accelerating spread of foot and mouth, and by the continuing slowness of the official response.</p> <p>\"In 1967 the vet came in the morning and if he found anything wrong, the animals would be dead by noon and buried before it got dark,\" she recalled. \"Now it's taking up to seven days before infected animals are slaughtered, and then they are left lying in the fields for days after that.\"</p> <p>On the vexed issue of whether healthy animals should be added to the condemned list as a kind of FMD firebreak, Marilyn is torn between sympathy with farmers who are resisting the move, and solidarity on the main issue of exterminating the pestilence. She is horrified by the potential for confrontation between farmers and the authorities. \"It could divide people who should be working together,\" she said.</p> <p>In the wake of the immediate threat to Mill Farm and its neighbours, comes another fear: that the tightening net of outbreaks - eight in next-door Gloucestershire, and more in Northamptonshire and Warwickshire - will deepen the squeeze on the all-important tourist trade.</p> <p><b>The restaurateur</b></p> <p>It was another wretched Sunday lunchtime at Stones, the smart new restaurant in the heart of Chipping Norton. For the third week in a row, the passing trade has simply failed to materialise - though owner Brian Galbraith did brighten the gloom with a successful St Patrick's night hooley on Saturday.</p> <p>Stones, fairly recently opened, has yet to establish a regular local clientele, though it is building up a loyal following in a ten-pub town. It depends for the moment on the normally steady flow of traffic and and from the main Cotswolds centres - and that traffic has slowed to a trickle.</p> <p>Now, the hotels, bars, cafes and the rest are nervously looking ahead to Easter, and the start of the season proper. They have already lost out on the Cheltenham festival, which should have brought a rush of business last week, and there is little optimism that the festival will be re-staged, as announced, in the middle of April. For most of the tourist trade, the business lost so far will simply never be recovered.</p> <p><b>The butcher</b></p> <p>For John Kench the butcher, the crisis has brought mixed fortunes. After initial worries about supplies and prices, both have settled down and he has seen a new influx of customers for his high quality, British-supplied meat. Still, there lurks a worry that, as the crisis shows no signs of abating, there could be renewed pressure on supplies.</p> <p>\"I haven't heard anything solid, but if it goes on and on, we may have some problems. It's just my own personal feeling, but we may get some shortages and that will make life difficult,\" he said.</p> <p>One aspect of John's business is already taking a hit: his normally thriving outdoor catering service. In a normal summer, he could expected to cook and serve gargantuan quantities of barbeque goodies, pig roasts and the like at farm fairs, private parties, and other such countryside events.</p> <p>As things stand, he has lost bookings worth at least \u00a35000, and has nothing in prospect until July.</p> <p><b>The supermarket manager</b></p> <p>At the Chipping Norton Co-op, supplies are also holding up well, and there is little upward pressure on prices. But unlike John Kench, who is managing to get virtually all he needs from British suppliers, the Oxford, Swindon and Gloucester Co-op is having to bring in meat from the EU to keep its shelves filled.</p> <p>\"Our customer count has been fairly static with no major increase or decrease. Of course, we always wish we were doing that little bit more but as it is we are still slightly up on last year,\" said manager Tony Hatch.</p> <p>\"Really, what we are doing is what we would expect at this time of year.

The official toll stands at 108 dead in what can be called the mystery of the cotton mill explosions - a series of bomb blasts in the northern city of Shijiazhuang in the darkness before dawn last Friday. Yesterday, China's ministry of public security was reported to have doubled the reward for information leading to the arrest of a long-time resident of the city, Jin Ruchao, 40. He was already wanted on suspicion of murdering his girlfriend a fortnight ago. And he is alleged to have been at odds with relatives living in the residential buildings hit by the blasts - two of them dormitories for cotton mill workers. \"Jin has a rude and savage temperament and a strong spirit of revenge,\" the police were quoted as saying. \"He has served a 10-year sentence for rape and his wife divorced him because of his behaviour.\" Ordinary Chinese have been badly shaken by the cotton mill explosions, in spite of minimum reporting and tight security around the scene.

Each day further polarises ethnic Macedonians and Albanians, weakening the moderates' ability to contain the conflict.</p> <p>Radicals are believed to be attempting a repeat of Kosovo in 1997, when the Kosovo Liberation Army pushed aside Albanian politicians advocating peaceful means. Support for the DPA appears to have evaporated in rural areas.</p> <p>Ethnic tension has risen dramatically recently. Families have fled homes fearing attacks by neighbours. Refugees from both sides want guns. Those that stay have formed self-defence groups.</p> <p>The DPA, led by Arben Xhaferi, was given five cabinet posts after entering a reformist government on a wave of optimism in 1998. It now stands accused of failing to deliver benefits to Albanians, who comprise up to a third of the 2m population. Violence has dissolved patience.</p> <p>\"Every day that this conflict goes on the militants drain Xhaferi.

      "bodyText": "Alarm is growing that Macedonia's moderate ethnic Albanian leaders are haemorrhaging support to the guerrillas. The insurgency has produced a dangerous marginalisation of the Democratic Albanian party (DPA), a partner in the ruling coalition, diplomats warned yesterday. Each day further polarises ethnic Macedonians and Albanians, weakening the moderates' ability to contain the conflict. Radicals are believed to be attempting a repeat of Kosovo in 1997, when the Kosovo Liberation Army pushed aside Albanian politicians advocating peaceful means. Support for the DPA appears to have evaporated in rural areas. Ethnic tension has risen dramatically recently. Families have fled homes fearing attacks by neighbours. Refugees from both sides want guns. Those that stay have formed self-defence groups. The DPA, led by Arben Xhaferi, was given five cabinet posts after entering a reformist government on a wave of optimism in 1998. It now stands accused of failing to deliver benefits to Albanians, who comprise up to a third of the 2m population. Violence has dissolved patience. \"Every day that this conflict goes on the militants drain Xhaferi. He is blamed for not delivering and risks becoming an irrelevance,\" said one western diplomat. Macedonia's Albanian language newspaper, Fakti, said his influence was dwindling. Mr Xhaferi, who is being slowly crippled by Parkinson's disease, has repeatedly condemned the insurgency as support for it grows. Dozens of interviews with Albanians in Tetovo and nearby villages, where fighting is heaviest, drew praise for the National Liberation Army. The DPA's headquarters, a two-storey office on Marshal Tito street in Tetovo, looked forlorn yesterday, with few officials inside. \"We are becoming targets within our own communities. People blame us for not ending discrimination and say we're now standing in the way,\" said one official. So far the intimidation was verbal, not physical, he said. Tetovo's chief of police, a DPA member, has been sidelined to let Macedonian colleagues take over. An analyst with the International Crisis Group said the guerrillas had shrewdly courted frustrated moderates by mostly limiting their demands to equal rights - a platform similar to the DPA's. Few Albanians share the west's concern that the guerrillas' real aim is annexing western Macedonia to an independent, greater Kosovo. In recent interviews Mr Xhaferi has criticised his government colleagues. Instead of discussing political solutions they were obsessed by security measures, he said. He also believes that Nato must intervene quickly to avoid a \"bloodbath\". Other Albanian leaders are warning that any attempt to solve the crisis by force will escalate the crisis. \"I am worried that the Macedonian government will try to have a military victory, that we will have a big inter-ethnic conflict not only between the different armed forces but between ethnic groups,\" said Rufi Osmani, a one-time political prisoner and the former mayor of Gostivar, a town 10 miles south of Tetovo. Twenty miles further south in Kicevo, there was unease. The Macedonian interior ministry reported fighting in the city on Thursday where nearly half the population is Albanian.",

      "body": "<p>Say cheese - the paparazzi are back in business. Last week, the Mirror published intrusive pictures of Camilla Parker Bowles. <strong>Roy Greenslade </strong>asks: is the press going back on its promise to clean up its act? </p> <p>Jason Fraser is a specialist photographer. Some people might call him a paparazzo. But Jason is a sensitive chap and he doesn't like being designated as a pap. So let's call him what he really is: a sneak photographer. He is, in fact, Britain's foremost celebrity stalker, the man who makes his living and a very good one it is, too by taking pictures of people without their knowledge. </p> <p>He haunts the world's beaches, creeping through bushes, hiding behind windbreaks, sometimes hiring boats, so that he can train his long lens on the famous as they soak up the sun, oblivious to the watching snapper. </p> <p>The results of Jason's latest coup were published by the Mirror last Wednesday: three pages showing Camilla Parker Bowles in a swimsuit on a beach in Mauritius headlined: 'Camilla as you have NEVER seen her.' For this portfolio of grainy, snatched pictures of a 52-year-old woman who thought she was enjoying a private moment on a private holiday, the paper paid Fraser pounds 20,000. Doubtless he will pick up more from foreign syndication, so he is a happy man. </p> <p>The benefit for the paper was an extra sale of about 30,000 copies, a reasonable return on its investment, and evidence that editor Piers Morgan's decision to buy the pictures was justified. Mirror sources indicate that there have been no complaints about the paper's use of the pictures though there were, supposedly, calls from people who thought the paper was 'too kind to Camilla' in its coverage. So Morgan is happy too. </p> <p>But Camilla, according to St James's Palace, was upset when she was told about the Mirror's scoop. That's hardly surprising. No one likes to think they have been watched and photographed by a stranger, and few enjoy the resulting unposed pictures. </p> <p>The Mirror tried to ease the pain, and deflect any possible criticism, by running deliberately hyperbolic copy: here's Camilla 'showing off a shapely body which could easily belong to a woman half her age'. This disingenuous fluff was calculated to excuse the intrusive nature of the exercise. </p> <p>Hang on, says the Mirror, this wasn't intrusion and certainly no breach of the editors' code of practice. Clause 3 (ii) states: 'The use of long-lens photography to take pictures of people in private places without their consent is unacceptable.' But this was a public beach. There were plenty of other people around. </p> <p>Even that isn't conclusive because there is an important addition to that clause: 'Private places are public or private property where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.' </p> <p>If Camilla wished to push it, she could make out a case based on her 'reasonable expectation'. I doubt that she will. Like so many of Fraser's other victims in the past couple of years stretching back to his infamous shots of Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed together on a boat days before they died she is likely to want to put the embarrassing episode behind her. </p> <p>Gradually, as the months pass, the press is conveniently forgetting the pledges it made after Diana's death. Remember the promises not to use paparazzi shots by the Mirror and the Daily Mail? Remember the hue and cry against the tabloids' use of sneak shots led by Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore? </p> <p>Yet the Mirror, Mail and Telegraph are all routinely using paparazzi pictures again. (A dozen or so were published by the Daily Telegraph during its recent serialisation of the book by bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones). Fraser's income therefore seems assured for a long time to come. None of his victims has ever gone to the Press Complaints Commission, and papers are not merely happy to use his pictures: picture desks do all they can to please him. Though both Sun editor David Yelland and Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre turned down the Camilla pictures, judging that they might suffer from a negative reaction in 'the court of public opinion', their picture desk executives were far from pleased. </p> <p>The Sun's team were not only amazed but alarmed. One said: 'You have to admire Morgan's bottle' and wondered whether, by rejecting the pictures, they would jeopardise their relationship with Fraser. </p> <p>It's not as if the paper is against his sneaky form of picture-taking. On February 29, it showed Gwyneth Paltrow sunbathing. On February 2, it published Fraser's topless pictures of Star Wars actress Natalie Portman. Both the Sun and the Daily Mail ran his holiday shots of Rory Bremner, Tiggy Legge-Bourke and Claudia Schiffer. All of these people may have expected privacy at the time, but neither the papers nor Fraser were troubled by that little matter. Celebrities are considered 'fair game'. </p> <p>Does Camilla come into the same league? Well, there is the argument that she is the mistress of the heir to the throne and the fact that the couple do not yet feel able to take a holiday together with his children (the princes are skiing in Klosters) is interesting enough to be brought to public attention. </p> <p>More pertinently, executives at the Mirror point to a St James's Palace spin -doctoring initiative which, they maintain, is aimed at presenting Camilla in a positive light. They claim that they, along with one or two other papers, often receive calls informing them that if a photographer were to be in a certain place at a certain time, they might be able to take a picture of Camilla attending, say, an opera or a private party linked to a charity. </p> <p>Therefore, it is argued, an orchestrated campaign to win the public to Camilla through manipulating the press entitles papers to take unsanctioned shots of her. In the words of one unrepentant Mirror journalist: 'If you dance with the devil, you will be pricked by his horns.' </p> <p>If this is true and a St James's Palace spokesman has described it as a 'monstrous lie' then it shows just why intrusion is such a grey area. </p> <p>But does it justify the activities of Jason Fraser? With the greatest of respect to other photographers, he is unlike most of his breed: middle-class, articulate, bilingual, well connected and, according to one of his detractors, rather sophisticated. </p> <p>When he discovered that Camilla was going to Mauritius (under a false name), he booked a first-class seat just behind hers.

      "bodyText": "Say cheese - the paparazzi are back in business. Last week, the Mirror published intrusive pictures of Camilla Parker Bowles. Roy Greenslade asks: is the press going back on its promise to clean up its act? Jason Fraser is a specialist photographer. Some people might call him a paparazzo. But Jason is a sensitive chap and he doesn't like being designated as a pap. So let's call him what he really is: a sneak photographer. He is, in fact, Britain's foremost celebrity stalker, the man who makes his living and a very good one it is, too by taking pictures of people without their knowledge. He haunts the world's beaches, creeping through bushes, hiding behind windbreaks, sometimes hiring boats, so that he can train his long lens on the famous as they soak up the sun, oblivious to the watching snapper. The results of Jason's latest coup were published by the Mirror last Wednesday: three pages showing Camilla Parker Bowles in a swimsuit on a beach in Mauritius headlined: 'Camilla as you have NEVER seen her.' For this portfolio of grainy, snatched pictures of a 52-year-old woman who thought she was enjoying a private moment on a private holiday, the paper paid Fraser pounds 20,000. Doubtless he will pick up more from foreign syndication, so he is a happy man. The benefit for the paper was an extra sale of about 30,000 copies, a reasonable return on its investment, and evidence that editor Piers Morgan's decision to buy the pictures was justified. Mirror sources indicate that there have been no complaints about the paper's use of the pictures though there were, supposedly, calls from people who thought the paper was 'too kind to Camilla' in its coverage. So Morgan is happy too. But Camilla, according to St James's Palace, was upset when she was told about the Mirror's scoop. That's hardly surprising. No one likes to think they have been watched and photographed by a stranger, and few enjoy the resulting unposed pictures. The Mirror tried to ease the pain, and deflect any possible criticism, by running deliberately hyperbolic copy: here's Camilla 'showing off a shapely body which could easily belong to a woman half her age'. This disingenuous fluff was calculated to excuse the intrusive nature of the exercise. Hang on, says the Mirror, this wasn't intrusion and certainly no breach of the editors' code of practice. Clause 3 (ii) states: 'The use of long-lens photography to take pictures of people in private places without their consent is unacceptable.' But this was a public beach. There were plenty of other people around. Even that isn't conclusive because there is an important addition to that clause: 'Private places are public or private property where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.' If Camilla wished to push it, she could make out a case based on her 'reasonable expectation'. I doubt that she will. Like so many of Fraser's other victims in the past couple of years stretching back to his infamous shots of Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed together on a boat days before they died she is likely to want to put the embarrassing episode behind her. Gradually, as the months pass, the press is conveniently forgetting the pledges it made after Diana's death. Remember the promises not to use paparazzi shots by the Mirror and the Daily Mail? Remember the hue and cry against the tabloids' use of sneak shots led by Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore? Yet the Mirror, Mail and Telegraph are all routinely using paparazzi pictures again. (A dozen or so were published by the Daily Telegraph during its recent serialisation of the book by bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones). Fraser's income therefore seems assured for a long time to come. None of his victims has ever gone to the Press Complaints Commission, and papers are not merely happy to use his pictures: picture desks do all they can to please him. Though both Sun editor David Yelland and Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre turned down the Camilla pictures, judging that they might suffer from a negative reaction in 'the court of public opinion', their picture desk executives were far from pleased. The Sun's team were not only amazed but alarmed. One said: 'You have to admire Morgan's bottle' and wondered whether, by rejecting the pictures, they would jeopardise their relationship with Fraser. It's not as if the paper is against his sneaky form of picture-taking. On February 29, it showed Gwyneth Paltrow sunbathing. On February 2, it published Fraser's topless pictures of Star Wars actress Natalie Portman. Both the Sun and the Daily Mail ran his holiday shots of Rory Bremner, Tiggy Legge-Bourke and Claudia Schiffer. All of these people may have expected privacy at the time, but neither the papers nor Fraser were troubled by that little matter. Celebrities are considered 'fair game'. Does Camilla come into the same league? Well, there is the argument that she is the mistress of the heir to the throne and the fact that the couple do not yet feel able to take a holiday together with his children (the princes are skiing in Klosters) is interesting enough to be brought to public attention. More pertinently, executives at the Mirror point to a St James's Palace spin -doctoring initiative which, they maintain, is aimed at presenting Camilla in a positive light. They claim that they, along with one or two other papers, often receive calls informing them that if a photographer were to be in a certain place at a certain time, they might be able to take a picture of Camilla attending, say, an opera or a private party linked to a charity. Therefore, it is argued, an orchestrated campaign to win the public to Camilla through manipulating the press entitles papers to take unsanctioned shots of her. In the words of one unrepentant Mirror journalist: 'If you dance with the devil, you will be pricked by his horns.' If this is true and a St James's Palace spokesman has described it as a 'monstrous lie' then it shows just why intrusion is such a grey area. But does it justify the activities of Jason Fraser? With the greatest of respect to other photographers, he is unlike most of his breed: middle-class, articulate, bilingual, well connected and, according to one of his detractors, rather sophisticated. When he discovered that Camilla was going to Mauritius (under a false name), he booked a first-class seat just behind hers. She, of course, was unaware that the personable 33-year-old on the British Airways flight was Diana's former photographic tormentor and soon to be hers. Fraser will not reveal his source, of course, but vehemently denies that it came from someone in BA, though it is strange how well informed he is about the movements of celebrities around the world. In Mauritius, Camilla was disturbed one afternoon by a helicopter hovering for 10 minutes above her hotel villa. Fraser says: 'I categorically deny that I was in a helicopter.' But I couldn't help recalling what he told a Daily Telegraph journalist in August 1997, when boasting of his prowess after his Diana-Dodi scoop: 'I do get a buzz out of hanging out of helicopters.' The Camilla pictures were certainly taken at ground or sea level, and Fraser defends taking them on the grounds that her friendship with Prince Charles has 'pushed her into the limelight'. He also thought the pictures showed her in 'a positive light'. This is one of his favourite responses when attacked about the surreptitious nature of his work. He once wrote: 'It is possible to take candid photographs of famous people in public and remain within the bounds of good taste, humour and decency.' He has also talked of having a self-imposed moral code. 'I would never do to anybody what I wouldn't want done to myself. By that I mean I don't do people who are in mourning or grieving; I wouldn't dream of photographing someone in hospital; I don't trespass on private property and I don't photograph on to private property.' Even more high-mindedly, he claims: 'Although I get paid a lot for the work I do, I don't do it for the money: I do it for the precious moments every year when the adrenalin rush is massive.' He also stresses that his pictures are harmless. 'Look, I'm not murdering people. I'm just taking pictures of people in as flattering a light as possible.' Maybe he is fooling himself. But unless anyone complains about Fraser and the papers which are eager to pay for his services, he will go on taking his pictures.",

      "body": "<b>What is wrong with the current policy?</b> <p>The infection is simply too infectious under British conditions in high density stock rearing areas for control by slaughter policy, especially where the authorities have proven unable to match the short recognition to slaughter interval used in the 1967-8 outbreak (almost all cases being slaughtered within 2 days). </p> <p>The speed of response in many cases can be seen to have contravened article 5.2(a) of Directive 85/511/EC, which requires slaughter and safe disposal of the carcasses 'without delay' and with no risk of spreading the virus. If the authorities are 'overwhelmed' in this process this is seen as an indication for the use of vaccination (European Commission, 1999). Council Directive 85/511/EEC, 18th November 1985 (legislation in force 17th March 2001) European Commission, 1999. Strategy for Emergency Vaccination against Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD). <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg24/health/sc/scah/index_en.html\" target=\"_new\">http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg24/health/sc/scah/index_en.html</a></p> <p>The authorities have mistakenly used the stated incubation period in the OIE Animal Health Code of 14 days in their predictions of effectiveness of their policy. The figure of 14 days refers to the maximum incubation time, a figure needed in the quarantine of premises and is far longer than the interval between infection of one animal and its ability to infect another (the generation interval). </p> <p>The latter is lower in sheep than other stock, therefore the rapidity of the slaughter response has to be faster than that of the 1967 situation to be effective. Since sheep with type O strain (as occurs in the current outbreak) are infective for other sheep and pigs in less than 4 days (and as many as 25% were infectious at 2 days; Donaldson, 1986; Cox et al, 1998, Callens et al, 1998), the 14 day incubation can therefore mask over 3 new amplifying rounds of infection. Each FMD infected animal is estimated to initiate between 2 and 73 new infections (Woolhouse, 1996), with the lower end of this range only occurring under dry, hot conditions with low densities of stock, situations which are far from the case in sheep flocks in Cumbria. Every delay of 4 days or more enables a new generation of infective sheep (and/or transmission to other stock) to occur.</p> <p>\u0095 Cox et al, 1998. Report of the Session of the Research group of the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-mouth disease. FAO, Rome, pp139-143. Callens et al, 1998. ibid, pp129-138. Donaldson, 1986. Rev.Sci.tech.Off.int Epiz., 5(2), 315-321. Woolhouse, 1996. Epidemiol.Infect., 363-371.</p> <p> The current delayed slaughter response favours new infections, and unrecognised animals with FMD could therefore be expected to result in between 5 and 50 new infections within 7 days. Airborne spread within the neighbouring 3-5 km frequently occurred in the 1967/8 outbreak under 'unfavourable' conditions on calm, warm, dry spring days and up to 100 km under cooler, moist airflows with higher humidity. </p> <p>The reported delays of 3-4 days from suspicion of infection to slaughter are therefore too slow to be effective in preventing longer distance spread, and establishment of infection in new areas. It must be noted that the longest recorded distance of airborne transmission occurred exactly at this time of year (the winds of March 7th and 10th), and previous longest recorded (Denmark to Sweden) also occurred at the latitudes (54-560N) of Cumbria/south of Scotland (ie climatically very similar). </p> <p>\u0095 Haydon et al, 1997. J. math. Appl. Med. Biol., 14, 1-9.(information also from other sources) Donaldson, A.I. et al, 1982. Veterinary Record, 110, 53.</p> <p>The epidemiology of FMD involving sheep is far too uncertain to have confidence that a mass cull within 3 km would be effective, or scientifically justified. In the FMD epidemic in Greece in 1994 the infection in sheep 'faded out' although control measures were poorly implemented. (Callens et al, 1998, Kitching, 1998). </p> <p>In the Macedonian outbreak of 1996, FMD infection entered sheep subclinically and as many as 50% sampled 2 years later had evidence of past infection, but again this source did not result in the outbreak perpetuating itself. Experimental studies suggest sheep produce relatively little virus for onward transmission (compared to cattle, and over 1000 times less than pigs; Sellers, 1971) and are often poor at perpetuating infection by contact. The cull of sheep is therefore not supported by evidence whereas extremely active control of pig and cattle infections are. </p> <p>However the 'fade-out' scenarios mainly occurred under hot, dry conditions, (with the exception of Tunisia in 1989), whereas under cool, moist conditions, with overcast skies, long distance spread over land (1-100 km, beyond the restriction zones) is possible ), particularly from cattle and pig sources, and has already thought to have occurred in this outbreak (Vet Record, March 9th 2001). </p> <p>Further, since sheep are the most sensitive species for becoming infected with virus, there is simply no information available on how many animals have become infected within or beyond the 3 km restriction zones, especially those which may have received windborne virus from the first infected pig farms. It simply cannot be concluded that infection has been restricted to areas planned for the cull.</p> <p>\u0095 Sorensen, K.J., &amp; Naletoski, I. (1998).

Bull., 41, 431-439.</p> <p>The UK mass cull, therefore, unless it had occurred much earlier and involving all cattle and pigs in the restricted zones would be nowhere near sufficient to prevent infection in cattle and sheep beyond the 3 km radius. Since clinical screening in sheep is so poor a guide to recognition (Callens, 1998, ref above), almost certainly the cull would be a temporary measure and a prelude to later larger culls (which would be very vigorously opposed) in the areas beyond the 3 km restriction, and/or the later use of vaccination. </p> <p><b>What are the effective alternatives? </b></p> <p>An emergency vaccination strategy, with stamping out of infected cases, was vigorously promoted and financially supported by the EU and was very effective in the control of type A FMD in Albania (Berlinzani et a, 1998) and neighbouring Macedonia in 1996, with elimination of outbreaks within 12 weeks and 3 weeks respectively. The former was the first outbreak in the region and therefore international responses were delayed; in the latter an area as large as Cumbria was involved and 120,000 cattle were vaccinated, and 4,500 cattle destroyed.</p> <p>\u0095 Berlinzani, A, Brocchi, B.,&amp; Simone, F. (1998). Report of the Session of the Research group of the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-mouth disease. FAO, Rome, pp166-175. Sorensen, K.J., &amp; Naletoski, I. (1998). Ibid, pp 176-181.</p> <p>Emergency vaccination is an approved form of FMD control in Europe and there is significant preparedness to mount an effective vaccine based response, which MAFF and the EU has been funding for at least 15 years. </p> <p>A decision to use emergency vaccination is very likely to be approved without delay by the European Commission since the current outbreak meets almost all the criteria outlined in their policy guidelines (European Commission, 1999): <br>A high density of susceptible animals, (Cumbria, Dumfrieshire, mid-Wales and west Devon have very high ruminant densities favouring rapid transmission.) <br>An infrastucture that is capable of rapidly deploying vaccination (we have highly motivated and technically competent farm staff used to vaccinating their own animals and hundreds of veterinarians and veterinary students available to undertake the work) <br> Predicted airborne spread of the virus (a situation that favours the use of vaccination). Although pig farms are less involved in the current locations, climatic conditions favour airborne spread from cattle farms, which paradoxically are not destined for the proposed cull. <br> A suitable vaccine exists (there are at least 500,000 doses (equal to 1,000,000 sheep doses ) of type O vaccine at Pirbright, UK and about 10 million in the European Vaccine bank). <br>The incidence slope; new outbreaks are occurring daily (a rise to a record of 37 new cases on 17/3) and a very significant reservoir of infection is still present awaiting slaughter, capable of generating new waves of infection. <br>Distribution of outbreaks; widespread outbreaks are seen as an indication for vaccination (29 counties, 17th March). However the main foci could be surrounded by an immune barrier by ring vaccination, an approved EU approved strategies (see below). <br>Public reaction to stamping out; a significant negative reaction is seen as an indicator for vaccine use, since the reaction would be damaging to eventual control (non-compliance) and international opinion to Europe </p> <p>Likelihood exists of the European Commission request for regionalisation of the vaccinated population; the position of the comittee which framed the Report was that there would be no reason to refuse a request to regionalise the outbreak by vaccination if 1) the disease control measures would be fully enforced, 2) the protection and surveillance zones are subjected to strict controls, and 3) the control of movement of animals and their products is effective, each of which can be expected to demonstrably be the case with current EU opinion on MAFF\u00eds capabilities. </p> <p>Another indication for vaccination is 'an overwhelming of the capacity to kill and dispose of carcasses within a short time period' (ibid, p 5); patently the case in this outbreak where the delayed slaughter and disposal brings a risk of onward transmission. European Commission, 1999. Strategy for Emergency Vaccination against Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD). <a href=\"http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg24/health/sc/scah/index_en.html\" target=\"_new\">http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg24/health/sc/scah/index_en.html</a></p> <p>However, what the Emergency Vaccination report fails to consider is the value of prevention of virus entry into hill sheep and wildlife populations in upland areas: this should be a strong indicator for vaccination, since a huge cull (in effect, total depopulation) if control by slaughter is the only option.</p> <p><b>What are the advantages of emergency vaccination </b> </p> <p>Emergency vaccination is of proven use in FMD control (European Commission, 1999, Salt, 1997). It can be used in two ways, simultaneously or separately; to create an immune barrier ('ring' or 'belt' vaccination, creating immunised zones) to prevent spread through populations at risk from airborne or local spread of infection, or to 'dampen down' infection within known FMD infected areas where there is a recognised urgent need to reduce virus transmission and to prevent onward spread beyond the restricted area.( European Commission, 1999, p5). </p> <p>Rapid reduction in virus circulation and new cases; as noted for Macedonia, effective and rapid deployment of vaccination reduced the total period of reported FMD cases to 3 weeks, despite over 18 villages in two districts being involved and avoided establishment in the sheep population of the region. </p> <p> Vaccination limited the slaughter to only 4500 animals. It is capable of enormously reducing the risk of airborne and vehicular spread to unaffected areas, vastly increasing public confidence within and outwith restricted areas in the control process. Vaccination is also seen as ethically and publically acceptable, a rational response to an exceptionally infective condition and which has a very rapid response. Public acceptance, and farming compliance would be expected to be exceptionally high compared to mass culling. </p> <p> The activities can be undertaken by personnel who are not in short supply (as are veterinarians at present); most farmers could undertake, with brief training and with additional support (veterinary students are one resource). It enables valuable germ-plasm to be saved. The current culling policy is unacceptable for its impact on rare breeds and high genetic quality stock; emergency vaccination can enable this to be mitigated.</p> <p>Present recommendations under the rapid system (3 months) for regaining FMD freedom require that vaccinated animals are slaughtered. This would give a short opportunity before slaughter to enable germ plasm (particularly semen) to be collected and stored, which could be later be tested with internationally approved tests (ie in the OIE Manual of Standards for diagnostic tests) recommended for FMD freedom in germ plasm, and later used in re-establishment of the breed line. If vaccinated animals were not slaughtered, a 12 month period would need to elapse after the last case before international recognition of live trade.</p> <p>\u0095 Salt, J. (1997). Vaccination against FMD. Veterinary Vaccinology, Elsevier Press. pp641-649.</p> <p> An effective vaccine is available and approved for emergency use. Two banks of vaccine for emergency use occur in the UK, the International vaccine Bank and the European vaccine bank, both held at Pirbright (the latter bank has also deposits of vaccine in 3 other countries). These banks have 0.5 million and 10 million cattle doses of suitable O type available, which translates to about 22 million sheep doses. Callis, J.J (1997). Problems of vaccine distribution (vaccine banks). Veterinary Vaccinology, Elsevier Press. pp703-704. The aim of vaccination is two fold; to protect stock against the disease, but of even greater significance to the national herd, to vastly reduce the proportion of animals which could amplify virus to a point where it is unable to create new cases and naturally does out, or more as required the limited cases can be detected and stamped out. </p> <p>The proportion of each flock herd to be effectively immunised must be at least 70%, preferably at least 80% (Salt, 1997; and Professor Ahl, Tubingen, formerly Chair of EU Animal Health and Welfare Ctte, FMD Emergency vaccination working group); a very achievable figure in the UK where very high compliance is expected, and in such an emergency as this it would be expected that farmers would be anxious to achieve near 100% vaccination rates. It is often said that the FMD vaccine is a poor one, and therefore emergency vaccines are specially formulated to achieve high and rapid responses (below). Salt, 1997, reference above. </p> <p>These emergency vaccines have a high \"payload\" in order to be rapidly effective as a single shot; they have been shown to be effective as early as 3 days after immunisation, in prevention of infection and disease, within between 4 and 7 days all immunised cattle and sheep being prevented from becoming 'amplifiers' capable of onward transmission. (Cox et al, 1998, Salt et al,1997) This period is shorter than the period between the proposed cull and the expected start of the slaughter!!! Further high payload vaccines are considered effective against almost all strains of the virus type O, therefore expected to be effective in the UK epidemic.</p> <p>\u0095 Cox et al, 1998. Report of the Session of the Research group of the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-mouth disease. FAO, Rome, pp139-143 Salt et al,1997, Vaccine 16,7, 746-754</p> <p>Vaccine delivery to farmers in Cumbria would in my opinion be expected to result in near 100% vaccination rates within 5 days, and almost complete herd immunity in 10 days. A reduction in cases to nil could be expected within 3 weeks, although restrictions and the few remaining incubating cases that remain.</p> <p> The ramifications for farmers of emergency vaccination are almost certainly better than the current culling policy; but depend on whether MAFF opts for one of the following options: Vaccination in the restricted zones to prevent transmission and risk to surrounding areas, followed by slaughter of vaccinated animals and active cases. This would enable a return to FMD free status in 3 months under the OIE Animal Health Code (see: <a href=\"http://www.oie.int\" target=\"_new\">www.oie.int</a>), and despite the apparent severity of the requirement that vaccinated animals would be eventually slaughtered, the latter could occur in a progressive, orderly manner , allowing germ plasm from very valued blood lines to be stored for later re-stocking/breed resuscitation, and be more acceptable locally than mass culling. </p> <p>The vaccination could be restricted to sheep and pigs, since they have the principal risk of rapid virus amplification and disease is more difficult to detect. Fewer herds would therefore require emergency culling and the outbreak should be curtailed in 3 weeks. Vaccination in the restricted zones, plus ring vaccination to prevent onward transmission; more effective at outbreak control, but if vaccinated flocks/herds would be culled the impact on 'healthy' flocks would be high and apparently nonsensical. </p> <p>However in national terms, return to free status would be regained after 3 months of disease freedom and after cull of the last vaccinated animals. Vaccination as (b) but without culling of vaccinated animals unless FMD is diagnosed as present in the herd/flock; under this system return to free status12 months after the last case of disease. </p> <p>The economic loss associated with loss of the livestock trade is seen as the 'strongest argument against implementation of emergency vaccination' (European Commission, 1999) but needs to be set against the economic loss to other sectors (tourism etc) Vaccination would hugely reduce the compensation package, greatly reduce the compensatory loss of during re-stocking, and the cost of rural aid programmes after the outbreak. Importantly it would reduce the length of time from current to the last case of infection, which could be 2 months or longer (as it was in the more restricted 1967 outbreak) under the culling system or about 3 weeks under vaccination scenario.</p> <p><b> How quickly could movement of vaccinated animals be resumed, once disease is controlled?</b></p> <p> Free movement of vaccinated animals from free areas should be permitted is logical (European Commission, 1999), and the report provides criteria for animal movement after vaccination. It can be assumed to be resumed from 60 days after the completion of the emergency vaccination, provided that an effective and reliable surveillance system is in place aided by the recent tests that distinguish animals which have met virus from those which are merely vaccinated (Panina and Ahl, 1998), Working group on Emergency Vaccination, EU Animal health and Welfare Ctte, 1998). </p> <p>\u0095 Panina and Ahl, 1998, Working group on Emergency Vaccination, EU Animal health and Welfare Ctte, Report of the Session of the Research group of the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-mouth disease.

Since antibodies can also arise from vaccination, very considerable effort has been made in the 1990's to develop tests that distinguish antibodies resulting from those from infection. </p> <p>At least 5 different tests have been developed and validated (an entire European Union funded Concerted Action was devoted to this-research summarised in over 15 papers in the supplement of the Vet Quarterly, 1998, 20, suppl 2) and these now transform our ability to distinguish vaccinated animals which have not met the infection, and they can identify the important category of those which have been vaccinated in an emergency situation and subsequently become infected upon severe virus challenge. </p> <p>The international recognition ('standardisation') of these tests for the purposes of international trade is ongoing, and the Scientific Ctte of the European Commission was 'of the opinion that the application of NSP-tests allows for an earlier lifting of the restrictions on the movement of vaccinated animals'. Changes to the Animal Health Code of the OIE in respect of testing vaccinated animals as part of the process of regaining FMD freedom, and are under consideration by the OIE, Paris. Amendment of the Animal Health code could occur within 2 months, given the strong European consensus on the use of these tests.</p> <p> Therefore at WORST with emergency vaccination UK exports would be curtailed for 12 months; at best the period could be as short as 3 months after the last case has been slaughtered if the OIE Animal health code was amended this spring.</p> <p> Example peer-reviewed papers; Bergmann, I.E., et al, 2000. Improvement of a sero-diagnostic strategy for FMD virus surveillance in cattle under systematic vaccination, Arch Virol., 145 (3), 473-489. Sorensen, K.J., et al. 1998. Differentiation of infection from vaccination in foot-and-mouth (shortened title). Arch Virool, 148 (8), 1461-76.</p> <p> In other words, if DG-Agriculture was to follow the recommendations of its Scientific Committee and recognise the use of the post-vaccination surveillance system (something it could do in days), and at a later date at its annual meeting this spring the Office Internationale des Epizooties in Paris (OIE) was to amend its animal health code, then FMD free status could be rapidly regained by vaccinated herds without a need for culling, unless shown to be infected. </p> <p> This decision could well be made in the next few weeks if MAFF pressed for it and would completely change the economic arguments (effect on livestock trade) against vaccination.</p> <p> With current regulations emergency vaccination conducted by an effective veterinary service with stamping out of remaining active cases, would at worst result in 12 months loss of the export trade. Surely MAFF should consult with the NFU and other bodies to determine if they would accept this financial loss rather than the enormity of the proposed regional cull.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

The infection is simply too infectious under British conditions in high density stock rearing areas for control by slaughter policy, especially where the authorities have proven unable to match the short recognition to slaughter interval used in the 1967-8 outbreak (almost all cases being slaughtered within 2 days). The speed of response in many cases can be seen to have contravened article 5.2(a) of Directive 85/511/EC, which requires slaughter and safe disposal of the carcasses 'without delay' and with no risk of spreading the virus. If the authorities are 'overwhelmed' in this process this is seen as an indication for the use of vaccination (European Commission, 1999). Council Directive 85/511/EEC, 18th November 1985 (legislation in force 17th March 2001) European Commission, 1999. Strategy for Emergency Vaccination against Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD). http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg24/health/sc/scah/index_en.html The authorities have mistakenly used the stated incubation period in the OIE Animal Health Code of 14 days in their predictions of effectiveness of their policy. The figure of 14 days refers to the maximum incubation time, a figure needed in the quarantine of premises and is far longer than the interval between infection of one animal and its ability to infect another (the generation interval). The latter is lower in sheep than other stock, therefore the rapidity of the slaughter response has to be faster than that of the 1967 situation to be effective. Since sheep with type O strain (as occurs in the current outbreak) are infective for other sheep and pigs in less than 4 days (and as many as 25% were infectious at 2 days; Donaldson, 1986; Cox et al, 1998, Callens et al, 1998), the 14 day incubation can therefore mask over 3 new amplifying rounds of infection. Each FMD infected animal is estimated to initiate between 2 and 73 new infections (Woolhouse, 1996), with the lower end of this range only occurring under dry, hot conditions with low densities of stock, situations which are far from the case in sheep flocks in Cumbria. Every delay of 4 days or more enables a new generation of infective sheep (and/or transmission to other stock) to occur. \u0095 Cox et al, 1998. Report of the Session of the Research group of the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-mouth disease. FAO, Rome, pp139-143. Callens et al, 1998. ibid, pp129-138. Donaldson, 1986. Rev.Sci.tech.Off.int Epiz., 5(2), 315-321. Woolhouse, 1996. Epidemiol.Infect., 363-371. The current delayed slaughter response favours new infections, and unrecognised animals with FMD could therefore be expected to result in between 5 and 50 new infections within 7 days. Airborne spread within the neighbouring 3-5 km frequently occurred in the 1967/8 outbreak under 'unfavourable' conditions on calm, warm, dry spring days and up to 100 km under cooler, moist airflows with higher humidity. The reported delays of 3-4 days from suspicion of infection to slaughter are therefore too slow to be effective in preventing longer distance spread, and establishment of infection in new areas. It must be noted that the longest recorded distance of airborne transmission occurred exactly at this time of year (the winds of March 7th and 10th), and previous longest recorded (Denmark to Sweden) also occurred at the latitudes (54-560N) of Cumbria/south of Scotland (ie climatically very similar). \u0095 Haydon et al, 1997. J. math. Appl. Med. Biol., 14, 1-9.(information also from other sources) Donaldson, A.I. et al, 1982. Veterinary Record, 110, 53. The epidemiology of FMD involving sheep is far too uncertain to have confidence that a mass cull within 3 km would be effective, or scientifically justified. In the FMD epidemic in Greece in 1994 the infection in sheep 'faded out' although control measures were poorly implemented. (Callens et al, 1998, Kitching, 1998). In the Macedonian outbreak of 1996, FMD infection entered sheep subclinically and as many as 50% sampled 2 years later had evidence of past infection, but again this source did not result in the outbreak perpetuating itself. Experimental studies suggest sheep produce relatively little virus for onward transmission (compared to cattle, and over 1000 times less than pigs; Sellers, 1971) and are often poor at perpetuating infection by contact. The cull of sheep is therefore not supported by evidence whereas extremely active control of pig and cattle infections are. However the 'fade-out' scenarios mainly occurred under hot, dry conditions, (with the exception of Tunisia in 1989), whereas under cool, moist conditions, with overcast skies, long distance spread over land (1-100 km, beyond the restriction zones) is possible ), particularly from cattle and pig sources, and has already thought to have occurred in this outbreak (Vet Record, March 9th 2001). Further, since sheep are the most sensitive species for becoming infected with virus, there is simply no information available on how many animals have become infected within or beyond the 3 km restriction zones, especially those which may have received windborne virus from the first infected pig farms. It simply cannot be concluded that infection has been restricted to areas planned for the cull. \u0095 Sorensen, K.J., &amp; Naletoski, I. (1998). Report of the Session of the Research group of the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-mouth disease. FAO, Rome , pp 176-181. Callens, M., et al. 1998. ibid, pp 129-135. Kitching, P. 1998. A recent history of FMD. J. Comp. Path., 118, 89-108 Sellers, R.F 1971. Quantitiative aspects of the spread of FMD. Vet. Bull., 41, 431-439. The UK mass cull, therefore, unless it had occurred much earlier and involving all cattle and pigs in the restricted zones would be nowhere near sufficient to prevent infection in cattle and sheep beyond the 3 km radius. Since clinical screening in sheep is so poor a guide to recognition (Callens, 1998, ref above), almost certainly the cull would be a temporary measure and a prelude to later larger culls (which would be very vigorously opposed) in the areas beyond the 3 km restriction, and/or the later use of vaccination. What are the effective alternatives? An emergency vaccination strategy, with stamping out of infected cases, was vigorously promoted and financially supported by the EU and was very effective in the control of type A FMD in Albania (Berlinzani et a, 1998) and neighbouring Macedonia in 1996, with elimination of outbreaks within 12 weeks and 3 weeks respectively. The former was the first outbreak in the region and therefore international responses were delayed; in the latter an area as large as Cumbria was involved and 120,000 cattle were vaccinated, and 4,500 cattle destroyed. \u0095 Berlinzani, A, Brocchi, B.,&amp; Simone, F. (1998). Report of the Session of the Research group of the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-mouth disease. FAO, Rome, pp166-175. Sorensen, K.J., &amp; Naletoski, I. (1998). Ibid, pp 176-181. Emergency vaccination is an approved form of FMD control in Europe and there is significant preparedness to mount an effective vaccine based response, which MAFF and the EU has been funding for at least 15 years. A decision to use emergency vaccination is very likely to be approved without delay by the European Commission since the current outbreak meets almost all the criteria outlined in their policy guidelines (European Commission, 1999): A high density of susceptible animals, (Cumbria, Dumfrieshire, mid-Wales and west Devon have very high ruminant densities favouring rapid transmission.) An infrastucture that is capable of rapidly deploying vaccination (we have highly motivated and technically competent farm staff used to vaccinating their own animals and hundreds of veterinarians and veterinary students available to undertake the work) Predicted airborne spread of the virus (a situation that favours the use of vaccination). Although pig farms are less involved in the current locations, climatic conditions favour airborne spread from cattle farms, which paradoxically are not destined for the proposed cull. A suitable vaccine exists (there are at least 500,000 doses (equal to 1,000,000 sheep doses ) of type O vaccine at Pirbright, UK and about 10 million in the European Vaccine bank). The incidence slope; new outbreaks are occurring daily (a rise to a record of 37 new cases on 17/3) and a very significant reservoir of infection is still present awaiting slaughter, capable of generating new waves of infection. Distribution of outbreaks; widespread outbreaks are seen as an indication for vaccination (29 counties, 17th March). However the main foci could be surrounded by an immune barrier by ring vaccination, an approved EU approved strategies (see below). Public reaction to stamping out; a significant negative reaction is seen as an indicator for vaccine use, since the reaction would be damaging to eventual control (non-compliance) and international opinion to Europe Likelihood exists of the European Commission request for regionalisation of the vaccinated population; the position of the comittee which framed the Report was that there would be no reason to refuse a request to regionalise the outbreak by vaccination if 1) the disease control measures would be fully enforced, 2) the protection and surveillance zones are subjected to strict controls, and 3) the control of movement of animals and their products is effective, each of which can be expected to demonstrably be the case with current EU opinion on MAFF\u00eds capabilities. Another indication for vaccination is 'an overwhelming of the capacity to kill and dispose of carcasses within a short time period' (ibid, p 5); patently the case in this outbreak where the delayed slaughter and disposal brings a risk of onward transmission. European Commission, 1999. Strategy for Emergency Vaccination against Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD). http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg24/health/sc/scah/index_en.html However, what the Emergency Vaccination report fails to consider is the value of prevention of virus entry into hill sheep and wildlife populations in upland areas: this should be a strong indicator for vaccination, since a huge cull (in effect, total depopulation) if control by slaughter is the only option. What are the advantages of emergency vaccination Emergency vaccination is of proven use in FMD control (European Commission, 1999, Salt, 1997). It can be used in two ways, simultaneously or separately; to create an immune barrier ('ring' or 'belt' vaccination, creating immunised zones) to prevent spread through populations at risk from airborne or local spread of infection, or to 'dampen down' infection within known FMD infected areas where there is a recognised urgent need to reduce virus transmission and to prevent onward spread beyond the restricted area.( European Commission, 1999, p5). Rapid reduction in virus circulation and new cases; as noted for Macedonia, effective and rapid deployment of vaccination reduced the total period of reported FMD cases to 3 weeks, despite over 18 villages in two districts being involved and avoided establishment in the sheep population of the region. Vaccination limited the slaughter to only 4500 animals. It is capable of enormously reducing the risk of airborne and vehicular spread to unaffected areas, vastly increasing public confidence within and outwith restricted areas in the control process. Vaccination is also seen as ethically and publically acceptable, a rational response to an exceptionally infective condition and which has a very rapid response. Public acceptance, and farming compliance would be expected to be exceptionally high compared to mass culling. The activities can be undertaken by personnel who are not in short supply (as are veterinarians at present); most farmers could undertake, with brief training and with additional support (veterinary students are one resource). It enables valuable germ-plasm to be saved. The current culling policy is unacceptable for its impact on rare breeds and high genetic quality stock; emergency vaccination can enable this to be mitigated. Present recommendations under the rapid system (3 months) for regaining FMD freedom require that vaccinated animals are slaughtered. This would give a short opportunity before slaughter to enable germ plasm (particularly semen) to be collected and stored, which could be later be tested with internationally approved tests (ie in the OIE Manual of Standards for diagnostic tests) recommended for FMD freedom in germ plasm, and later used in re-establishment of the breed line. If vaccinated animals were not slaughtered, a 12 month period would need to elapse after the last case before international recognition of live trade. \u0095 Salt, J. (1997). Vaccination against FMD. Veterinary Vaccinology, Elsevier Press. pp641-649. An effective vaccine is available and approved for emergency use. Two banks of vaccine for emergency use occur in the UK, the International vaccine Bank and the European vaccine bank, both held at Pirbright (the latter bank has also deposits of vaccine in 3 other countries). These banks have 0.5 million and 10 million cattle doses of suitable O type available, which translates to about 22 million sheep doses. Callis, J.J (1997). Problems of vaccine distribution (vaccine banks). Veterinary Vaccinology, Elsevier Press. pp703-704. The aim of vaccination is two fold; to protect stock against the disease, but of even greater significance to the national herd, to vastly reduce the proportion of animals which could amplify virus to a point where it is unable to create new cases and naturally does out, or more as required the limited cases can be detected and stamped out. The proportion of each flock herd to be effectively immunised must be at least 70%, preferably at least 80% (Salt, 1997; and Professor Ahl, Tubingen, formerly Chair of EU Animal Health and Welfare Ctte, FMD Emergency vaccination working group); a very achievable figure in the UK where very high compliance is expected, and in such an emergency as this it would be expected that farmers would be anxious to achieve near 100% vaccination rates. It is often said that the FMD vaccine is a poor one, and therefore emergency vaccines are specially formulated to achieve high and rapid responses (below). Salt, 1997, reference above. These emergency vaccines have a high \"payload\" in order to be rapidly effective as a single shot; they have been shown to be effective as early as 3 days after immunisation, in prevention of infection and disease, within between 4 and 7 days all immunised cattle and sheep being prevented from becoming 'amplifiers' capable of onward transmission. (Cox et al, 1998, Salt et al,1997) This period is shorter than the period between the proposed cull and the expected start of the slaughter!!! Further high payload vaccines are considered effective against almost all strains of the virus type O, therefore expected to be effective in the UK epidemic. \u0095 Cox et al, 1998. Report of the Session of the Research group of the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-mouth disease. FAO, Rome, pp139-143 Salt et al,1997, Vaccine 16,7, 746-754 Vaccine delivery to farmers in Cumbria would in my opinion be expected to result in near 100% vaccination rates within 5 days, and almost complete herd immunity in 10 days. A reduction in cases to nil could be expected within 3 weeks, although restrictions and the few remaining incubating cases that remain. The ramifications for farmers of emergency vaccination are almost certainly better than the current culling policy; but depend on whether MAFF opts for one of the following options: Vaccination in the restricted zones to prevent transmission and risk to surrounding areas, followed by slaughter of vaccinated animals and active cases. This would enable a return to FMD free status in 3 months under the OIE Animal Health Code (see: www.oie.int), and despite the apparent severity of the requirement that vaccinated animals would be eventually slaughtered, the latter could occur in a progressive, orderly manner , allowing germ plasm from very valued blood lines to be stored for later re-stocking/breed resuscitation, and be more acceptable locally than mass culling. The vaccination could be restricted to sheep and pigs, since they have the principal risk of rapid virus amplification and disease is more difficult to detect. Fewer herds would therefore require emergency culling and the outbreak should be curtailed in 3 weeks. Vaccination in the restricted zones, plus ring vaccination to prevent onward transmission; more effective at outbreak control, but if vaccinated flocks/herds would be culled the impact on 'healthy' flocks would be high and apparently nonsensical. However in national terms, return to free status would be regained after 3 months of disease freedom and after cull of the last vaccinated animals. Vaccination as (b) but without culling of vaccinated animals unless FMD is diagnosed as present in the herd/flock; under this system return to free status12 months after the last case of disease. The economic loss associated with loss of the livestock trade is seen as the 'strongest argument against implementation of emergency vaccination' (European Commission, 1999) but needs to be set against the economic loss to other sectors (tourism etc) Vaccination would hugely reduce the compensation package, greatly reduce the compensatory loss of during re-stocking, and the cost of rural aid programmes after the outbreak. Importantly it would reduce the length of time from current to the last case of infection, which could be 2 months or longer (as it was in the more restricted 1967 outbreak) under the culling system or about 3 weeks under vaccination scenario. How quickly could movement of vaccinated animals be resumed, once disease is controlled? Free movement of vaccinated animals from free areas should be permitted is logical (European Commission, 1999), and the report provides criteria for animal movement after vaccination. It can be assumed to be resumed from 60 days after the completion of the emergency vaccination, provided that an effective and reliable surveillance system is in place aided by the recent tests that distinguish animals which have met virus from those which are merely vaccinated (Panina and Ahl, 1998), Working group on Emergency Vaccination, EU Animal health and Welfare Ctte, 1998). \u0095 Panina and Ahl, 1998, Working group on Emergency Vaccination, EU Animal health and Welfare Ctte, Report of the Session of the Research group of the European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-mouth disease. FAO, Rome, pp276-278 European Commission, 1999. Strategy for Emergency Vaccination against Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD). http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg24/health/sc/scah/index_en.htmle Doesn't vaccination interfere with our FMD free status? European policy of non-vaccination has the objective of creating a European herd which is without evidence of antibodies to FMD virus, since the latter might indicate animals which carry infection after exposure. Since antibodies can also arise from vaccination, very considerable effort has been made in the 1990's to develop tests that distinguish antibodies resulting from those from infection. At least 5 different tests have been developed and validated (an entire European Union funded Concerted Action was devoted to this-research summarised in over 15 papers in the supplement of the Vet Quarterly, 1998, 20, suppl 2) and these now transform our ability to distinguish vaccinated animals which have not met the infection, and they can identify the important category of those which have been vaccinated in an emergency situation and subsequently become infected upon severe virus challenge. The international recognition ('standardisation') of these tests for the purposes of international trade is ongoing, and the Scientific Ctte of the European Commission was 'of the opinion that the application of NSP-tests allows for an earlier lifting of the restrictions on the movement of vaccinated animals'. Changes to the Animal Health Code of the OIE in respect of testing vaccinated animals as part of the process of regaining FMD freedom, and are under consideration by the OIE, Paris. Amendment of the Animal Health code could occur within 2 months, given the strong European consensus on the use of these tests. Therefore at WORST with emergency vaccination UK exports would be curtailed for 12 months; at best the period could be as short as 3 months after the last case has been slaughtered if the OIE Animal health code was amended this spring. Example peer-reviewed papers; Bergmann, I.E., et al, 2000. Improvement of a sero-diagnostic strategy for FMD virus surveillance in cattle under systematic vaccination, Arch Virol., 145 (3), 473-489. Sorensen, K.J., et al. 1998. Differentiation of infection from vaccination in foot-and-mouth (shortened title). Arch Virool, 148 (8), 1461-76. In other words, if DG-Agriculture was to follow the recommendations of its Scientific Committee and recognise the use of the post-vaccination surveillance system (something it could do in days), and at a later date at its annual meeting this spring the Office Internationale des Epizooties in Paris (OIE) was to amend its animal health code, then FMD free status could be rapidly regained by vaccinated herds without a need for culling, unless shown to be infected. This decision could well be made in the next few weeks if MAFF pressed for it and would completely change the economic arguments (effect on livestock trade) against vaccination. With current regulations emergency vaccination conducted by an effective veterinary service with stamping out of remaining active cases, would at worst result in 12 months loss of the export trade. Surely MAFF should consult with the NFU and other bodies to determine if they would accept this financial loss rather than the enormity of the proposed regional cull. What's going on?

Vaccination would, it says, end the public's horror of mass funeral pyres and decomposing carcasses and help restore confidence in Britain's farmers.</p> <p>\"The infection is simply too infectious under British conditions in high-density stock- rearing areas for control by slaughter policy, especially where the authorities have proven unable to slaughter within two days. The speed of the response in many cases can be seen to have contravened EU law which requires slaughter and safe disposal without delay and with no risk of spreading the virus,\" the paper says.</p> <p>The report was written for Elm Farm research centre, the world's leading organic farming research organisation, whose projects are funded by Maff, the EU and others. The centre is planning a legal challenge to the ministry's policy.</p> <p>The document, whose author asked to remain anonymous, suggests that the long delays in slaughtering and disposing of carcasses have already led to new infections and that each unrecognised animal with foot and mouth could be expected to result in between five and 50 new infections within seven days.</p> <p>\"The reported delays of three to four days from suspicion of infection to slaughter are too slow to be effective in preventing the spread of the disease beyond 3-5km and the establishment of infection in new areas.\"</p> <p>The report paints a dismal picture of the spread of the disease and suggests that the government has no idea how far it has spread. \"There is simply no evidence available on how many animals have become infected beyond the restriction zones, especially those which may have received windborne virus from the first infected pig farms. It simply cannot be concluded that infection has been restricted to areas planned for the cull,\" it says.</p> <p>It proposes immediate emergency vaccinations which can \"enormously\" reduce the risk of airborne and vehicular spread of the diseases to unaffected areas and would increase public confidence. \"It is also ethically and politically acceptable, a rational response to an exceptionally infective condition and which has a very rapid response. It could result in near 100% vaccination rates within five days and almost complete immunity in 10 days. A reduction of cases to zero could be expected within three weeks.\"</p> <p>The government has sev eral options, according to the paper. The first would be to vaccinate all sheep and pigs in the restricted zones to prevent transmission and risk to surrounding areas, followed by the \"orderly slaughter\" of all vaccinated animals and active cases. This, it says, would curtail the crisis within three weeks and allow Britain to regain its foot and mouth-free status within three months.</p> <p>Another option would be to vaccinate in the restricted zones and then in a ring around them. This, the paper says, would be more effective at controlling the outbreaks but would also mean the regional destruction of healthy flocks, which is seen by the public and farmers as nonsensical. However it, too, would enable Britain to quickly regain its FMD-free status.</p> <p>The third option would be to vaccinate animals without culling them unless foot and mouth is diagnosed as present in the herd. This would, says the report, damage the \u00a3400m-a-year export trade but should be set against the loss to other sectors, which have been estimated at up to \u00a39bn. \"At worst with emergency vaccination, exports would be curtailed for a year, at best for as short as three months\", the paper concludes.</p> <p>Crucially, it says, Britain could regain its FMD-free status and its export trade faster than the government has suggested, because new scientific tests have transformed scientists' ability to distinguish vaccinated animals that have not met the infection and also those that have been vaccinated and then met the virus. The EU scientific committee, the paper suggests, believes \"these tests would allow an earlier lifting of restrictions on the movement of vaccinated animals\".</p> <p>The ministry has so far dismissed vaccination as a viable option, but other countries, including the United States, now favour a mix of slaughter and emergency vaccination to combat outbreaks. Nationally, the National Farmers' Union is still opposed to vaccination, but the Cumbria branch has called for limited vaccination as the crisis has worsened.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,443686,00.html\">Full list: outbreaks and precautionary measures</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a></p> <p><b>The front line</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br>What is the situation on the ground?

The celebrity snapper who broke the first pictures of the love affair between the late Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed and took the photographs of Robbie Williams and Geri Halliwell on holiday in the south of France, has a reputation as one of Britain's top photographers. He claims to have been responsible for 75 newspaper splashes last year and is believed to have made up to \u00a31m out of the Diana and Dodi kiss picture. His decision to join Mr Desmond has stunned the industry - sources say it will have cost the group up to \u00a31m a year to compensate him for loss of earnings with other newspapers. Mr Fraser's hiring by the newspaper group underlines the importance to the Express boss of celebrity scoops and top class celebrity photographs. He is joining Northern &amp; Shell and Express Newspapers as executive director, where he will take responsibility for securing celebrity photographic exclusives for the Express, Sunday Express, the Daily Star and OK! magazine. Mr Desmond said in a statement that Mr Fraser \"will play a pivotal role in the building of a successful future for our publications and businesses\". The hiring, for an undisclosed sum, is consistent with Northern &amp; Shell's strategy of hiring expensive \"names\" to staff his papers at the expense of journalistic footsoldiers. The Express group yesterday hired Mirror columnist Charlie Catchpole as a celebrity TV columnist for the Express, and the group has famously secured the services of former Sun football writer Brian Woolnough in a deal believed to be worth some \u00a3200,000 a year. But last week it was disclosed that Mr Desmond wants to axe 145 jobs at the Express group in a bid to cut costs.

We had more than one or two chances to score against Greece and England in the autumn, and this time we'll have to take advantage.\"</p> <p>\u0095 <strong> The Blackburn midfielder David Dunn is out </strong> of England's Under-21 European Championship qualifier against Finland at Barnsley on Friday night. Dunn, the Under-21s' captain, has been struggling with a toe injury and has been advised to rest.

As a result, the young Ajax defender Petri Pasanen is likely to get another start. \"Petri had a good game against Luxembourg. He is mature for his age and he's got skill on the ball, so he'll get his chance, I'm sure,\" said Muurinen. \"Up front, we might even try two forwards, like we did against Luxembourg. Jonatan Johansson is one of the best in the Premiership, while Mikael Forssell and Shefki Kuqi are quickly learning their trade in the First Division.\" Muurinen admits, however, that Finland's best chance of scoring will come on the counter-attack, which places even greater emphasis on Litmanen. The 30-year-old has been struggling with injuries but came through 66 minutes of Liverpool's draw with Derby. \"His calf should be OK now and he's desperate to play on Saturday, but we'll have to prepare for the worst as well,\" said Muurinen. \"If he cannot play, it must not be the end of the world. \"We have lots of players working abroad and we don't have to go out against any team just trying to defend. We had more than one or two chances to score against Greece and England in the autumn, and this time we'll have to take advantage.\" \u0095 The Blackburn midfielder David Dunn is out of England's Under-21 European Championship qualifier against Finland at Barnsley on Friday night. Dunn, the Under-21s' captain, has been struggling with a toe injury and has been advised to rest. He will therefore miss the England game but is expected to be fit when Blackburn return to First Division action at home to Burnley on Sunday week.",

      "bodyText": "The mother of one of the two producers of Spice Girls documentary Raw Spice is using PR expert Max Clifford to ensure her dead son gets his share of credit for the film. The film, which features previously unreleased footage of the Spice Girls before they became famous, is being screened tomorrow night and has already been the subject of a protracted legal battle. Now Matt Bowers's mother, Helen, is trying to ensure her son, who died before the film was cleared for broadcast, has become involved too. She is determined that her son gets appropriate credit for the programme. Mrs Bowers has been particularly keen that the Sun newspaper should not get an exclusive story on the programme. She is thought to have been angered by coverage in the Sun of her Matt's relationship with Royle Family star Caroline Aherne, and wanted to make sure the relationship was kept out of the film's publicity. \"I was contacted by Helen Bowers, who was concerned that she was not being consulted about the way her dead son was being presented in the publicity package for this film,\" said Mr Clifford. Mr Bowers made the film with partner Neil Davies but they were unable to do anything with the footage because the Spice Girls launched a legal battle to stop it being screened. \"Mrs Bowers was concerned Neil Davies was being presented as the major partner in this equation,\" said Mr Clifford. \"Mrs Bowers was concerned and upset that her dead son was being cast aside in the publicity for this programme.\" A Granada spokeswoman said: \"We have been liaising with Max and his client Helen on all aspect of the press and publicity surrounding this programme, and as far as we know both parties will be happy with it.\" It is thought that Mrs Bowers and Mr Clifford were in negotiations to get images from the film into OK! Mr Bowers filmed the then unknown Spice Girls up until 1995 with his business partner Neil Davies. But he died from cancer died four years ago and Mr Davies was forced into a legal battle on two fronts to get the film aired - one against the Spice Girls and the other against two other members of the firm who claimed the videos as assets The row was resolved last year in the high court when Neil Gaudino and Steve Newman were ordered to give the tapes back to Mr Davies.

BT, which was privatised in 1984, was at the forefront of deregulation and one of the first in the world to be exposed to competition. </p> <p>Much of the company's debt is a result of the auctions for next generation mobile phone licences in Britain and Germany, together accounting for around \u00a310bn.

The auctions were, unfortunately for BT, at the height of the dot.com boom when the potential for wireless internet had not yet been muddied by the sharp change in sentiment. </p> <p>The fresh demands for a new strategy come less than six months after Sir Peter unveiled a grand plan to pay down the mountain of debt by splitting BT into five different companies. By the end of 2001, he promised, the company would raise the first \u00a310bn by a partial flotation of its mobile phone holding company, BT Wireless, and Yell, its Yellow Pages division. </p> <p>But BT has been a victim of bad timing again. The turmoil in world stock markets that has sent the shares in telecoms companies nosediving has dampened any appetite for new shares among investors. The difficult flotation of Orange earlier this year (a company which had otherwise done little wrong) has provided ample evidence that investors no longer regard telecom shares as a must have. BT is being forced to rethink its plans, including cutting BT Wireless loose entirely through a full demerger. Investors are also likely to indicate that they would stomach a cut in the company's dividend. </p> <p>BT had hoped a rights issue would not be necessary but it faces a once unthinkable downgrading from the influential credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's next month. Last night Moody's, an international ratings agency, threatened to cut its debt ratings and expressed concern that the company would not be able to pay off its debts fast enough. If this happens, BT will face an extra \u00a3150m-200m in interest charges. </p> <p>The appointment as finance director of Philip Hampton, credited with breaking up another former state-owned company, British Gas, has proved popular with the City. Investors are divided over whether he should be groomed as the heir to Sir Peter. Sir Iain, who has spent his working life at BT, will be reluctant to step down before his official retirement next year. BT has found it difficult to fully shake off its nationalised culture and has been outmanoeuvered by rivals. The mantle of national champion has long since been taken by Vodafone, which is worth more than three times the market valuation of BT.

Yesterday it hit back against critics who said it had pocketed \u00a3250,000 from Comic Relief calls on Red Nose Day. </p> <p>The former state monopoly is perceived in the City to have failed in some key areas. While Vodafone has brazened its way through world markets with deal after deal to create a genuine world power, BT has failed to create a global company - aborting mergers with the likes of Cable &amp; Wireless and the US company MCI. In mobile phones, BT Cellnet has been left behind by Vodafone and is on the verge of surrendering second place by subscriber numbers to Orange. BT has also failed to fully exploit the internet and found itself floundering compared with the likes of Freeserve, which have proved more imaginative over new services and pricing. </p> <p>BT's international ambitions have perhaps had a little too much of the empire about them. While Vodafone pursued a strategy of taking full control of its overseas affiliates, BT was happy to take minority stakes in south-east Asian businesses in the belief that it would wield more influence than it perhaps had.

His father was an engineer, his mother a nurse, and they lived in a \"normal semi-detached house\". He is described by one former colleague as a \"straight up and down career executive\". </p> <p>Short and with the accent of estuary man, Sir Peter could hardly seem more different to the lofty Sir Iain, more characterised by his clipped vowels. </p> <p><strong>Sir Iain Vallance, chairman</strong><br> </p> <p> Sir Iain Vallance is the architect of the modern BT. It is a sobriquet that the the Oxford-educated Vallance was happy to accept - at least before its recent woes. </p> <p>He is said to have BT written through him like a \"stick of rock\", having started with the company's parent the General Post Office in 1966. His father was Post Office director in Scotland. </p> <p>He joined the board of the telecoms company in 1981 and played a crucial role in privatisation. It was Vallance who was ideologically attuned to the Tory administration - arguing that the markets would be the best place to raise money to upgrade the system. </p> <p>He was named chief of operations shortly after flotation, and was chief and executive and chairman by 1987. </p> <p>For many, Vallance was seen as too cautious, too redolent of the old state-owned monolith. But to supporters, he understood the need to take tough restructuring measures involving the losses of thousands of jobs. </p> <p>His undoubted failure was that BT did not become a global player. Mergers with Cable and Wireless and with MCI of the US which would have vaulted BT into the top rank both failed at the final hurdle.</p>",

It was a reminder, the company said, that telecoms was a tough market which would need some serious survival skills. Hired by BT in 1996, he has had to learn how to scrap. Sir Peter, 56, had not run a quoted company before and was in large part hired because of his international experience - he spent a substantial amount of his career in the US and Japan, including Texas Instruments and ICL. He has been largely responsible for the drive into overseas markets but saw his credibility in the City damaged by the aborted merger with US group MCI. Born in Hertfordshire and educated at Loughborough University, Bonfield 's favourite word to describe himself is \"normal\". His father was an engineer, his mother a nurse, and they lived in a \"normal semi-detached house\". He is described by one former colleague as a \"straight up and down career executive\". Short and with the accent of estuary man, Sir Peter could hardly seem more different to the lofty Sir Iain, more characterised by his clipped vowels. Sir Iain Vallance, chairman Sir Iain Vallance is the architect of the modern BT. It is a sobriquet that the the Oxford-educated Vallance was happy to accept - at least before its recent woes. He is said to have BT written through him like a \"stick of rock\", having started with the company's parent the General Post Office in 1966. His father was Post Office director in Scotland. He joined the board of the telecoms company in 1981 and played a crucial role in privatisation. It was Vallance who was ideologically attuned to the Tory administration - arguing that the markets would be the best place to raise money to upgrade the system. He was named chief of operations shortly after flotation, and was chief and executive and chairman by 1987. For many, Vallance was seen as too cautious, too redolent of the old state-owned monolith. But to supporters, he understood the need to take tough restructuring measures involving the losses of thousands of jobs. His undoubted failure was that BT did not become a global player. Mergers with Cable and Wireless and with MCI of the US which would have vaulted BT into the top rank both failed at the final hurdle.",

      "body": "<p>Anthony Storr, who has died of a heart attack aged 80, was Britain's most literate psychiatrist. A prolific author, journalist and radio and television commentator, he was widely respected as a fount of wisdom and good sense in a profession not particularly noted for such qualities. Like other kind and compassionate men, he was no stranger to suffering at formative stages of his life. </p> <p>Born in London, Storr was a solitary, friendless child, plagued by frequent illness, including severe asthma and septicaemia, from which he nearly died. He was the youngest of four children, separated by 10 years from his closest sibling. His father, Vernon Faithfull Storr, sub-dean of Westminster Abbey, was 51 when Anthony was born, and his mother, Katherine Cecilia Storr, was 44. They were first cousins, and their consanguinity probably accounted for his asthma, from which he, like two of his siblings, suffered for most of his life. He also seems to have inherited from his mother a tendency to occasional episodes of depression. </p> <p>Growing up in the privileged seclusion of Dean's Yard, Westminster, as virtually an only child, Storr was particularly affected by the trauma, shared by most boys of his class and time, of being sent away to a boarding prep school at the age of eight. There, and later at Winchester College, he was bitterly unhappy. </p> <p>Having been deprived of a childhood peer group in which to learn the skills of comradeship, he was ill-prepared for the rigours of boarding-school life. Extremely slow to make friends, and showing little proficiency for games, he was bullied, and made only average academic progress. Though utterly miserable, it never occurred to him to complain to his parents, or attempt to run away, because boarding school was then a fact of life. But the sense of being a loner never left him, and was to affect the course of his career, as well as the content of his books. </p> <p>What preserved his sanity and emotional equilibrium was a growing passion for music. From an early age, he attended performances in Westminster Abbey of such works as Bach's St Matthew Passion, and was later allowed to sit in the organ loft, an enormous thrill. </p> <p>At Winchester, he sang in the choir, played the viola in the orchestra and piano solos in concerts. He always maintained that he would much rather have been a professional musician than a psychiatrist or writer, had he been blessed with the necessary talent and training; he freely acknowledged that his friendship with artists of the calibre of Alfred Brendel, and the musicologist Hans Keller, meant far more than would have equivalent friendships with Freud, Jung or Adler. </p> <p>Storr's decision to become a psychiatrist was made soon after he went up to Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1939. His moral tutor was CP Snow, who became a lifelong friend. \"I owed him a tremendous debt,\" Storr told me. \"He was the first person who made me feel I might be any good at anything. I had disappointed my parents and teachers by not doing nearly as well as I should have. When I told Snow tentatively that I might go into psychiatry, he said, 'I think you'd be very good at it.' It was a ridiculous thing to decide one's future on a chance comment like that. The crucial thing was that he liked me, and thought I could do it.\" </p> <p>After two years at Cambridge, Storr was given a wartime courtesy degree without taking a tripos, and continued his medical studies at Westminster hospital (1941-44), where he won prizes for medicine and surgery. He gained membership of the Royal College of Physicians in 1946. </p> <p>His asthma precluded military service and, after a period as house physician at Runwell hospital, he went to the Maudsley hospital (1947-50), where he survived the ordeal of being Professor Aubrey Lewis's first senior registrar on his newly-formed professorial unit. Lewis, an obsessional polymath highly critical of his staff, undermined the confidence of everyone who worked for him. </p> <p>Storr stuck it for nearly two years, then asked to be moved, thus effectively ruining his prospects for advancement within the psychiatric establishment. \"I owed Lewis one thing, at least,\" admitted Storr. \"Once you had suffered the experience of presenting a case at one of his Monday morning conferences, no other public appearance, whether on radio, TV or the lecture platform, could hold any terrors for you.\" </p> <p>He obtained the diploma of psychological medicine in 1951, and, developing an interest in analytical psycho- therapy, went into analysis with Jung's English friend and colleague, Dr EA Bennet. He later became a member of the (Jungian) Society for Analytical Psychology. He practised psychotherapy privately, and, from 1961, combined his practice with various hospital appointments as a consultant. </p> <p>Storr's reputation as a writer and broadcaster began with publication of his first book, The Integrity Of The Personality, in 1960. He was 40, and, up to that point, had not thought of himself as a writer. \"I just felt the need to explain to myself what the hell I thought I was doing,\" he said. \"For me, that is the motive for writing anything. I get intrigued by a puzzle, and writing a book is the best way to solve it.\" </p> <p>During the next six years, 11 other books followed, of which the most notable were The Dynamics Of Creation (1972), Jung (1973), The Art Of Psychotherapy (1979), Solitude (1989), Freud (1989), his favourite, Music And The Mind (1993), and Feet Of Clay (1996). </p> <p>Although he did a Jungian training, Storr declined to be labelled a Jungian, preferring to remain \"an eclectic sceptic rather than a convert\". His books reflected this lack of dogmatism. His love of music and literature, together with his medical and psychiatric training, enabled him to bridge the \"two cultures\" defined by his friend, Snow. </p> <p>Storr's particular gift for rendering difficult concepts accessible, as well as his lucid, immensely readable style, made his books as appealing to lay people as to professionals, and his sales reflected this. All but two of his 12 titles have remained in print and, while sales were steady in the UK, they did particularly well in the United States, where Solitude sold 100,000 copies. The Essential Jung (1983) sold 50,000 worldwide, Freud sold 30,000 and Jung 75,000. The books were translated into 24 languages, including Korean and Malaysian, and Storr was especially charmed when Solitude was translated into Chinese for the republic of Inner Mongolia. </p> <p>Perhaps as a result of his own unhappiness, isolation and depression, Storr's work revealed an abiding concern for those trapped in suffering, whether as psychiatric pat- ients, prisoners or victims of oppression and torture. He served as a member of the Parole Board (1976-77) and the Williams Committee on Obscenity and Film Censorship (1977-79), and his need to penetrate the mysteries of deviant or violent behaviour was apparent in his books on Sex ual Deviation (1964), Human Aggression (1968) and Human Destructiveness (1972). </p> <p>At the same time, his understanding of human psychopathology gave him a rich appreciation of the creative possibilities inherent in mental suffering, and the powerful potential for self-healing to be found in artistic and intellectual creativity. This made him impatient with the medical model for psychiatry and its obsession with its symptomatic classification. \"I want to show,\" he wrote, \"that the dividing lines between sanity and mental illness have been drawn in the wrong place. The sane are madder than we think, the mad saner.\" </p> <p>In 1974, Storr gave up private practice in favour of a teaching appointment at the Warneford hospital, Oxford; a post he held until his retirement in 1984. He was very happy in Oxford, enjoying dining rights at Wadham College and becoming a fellow of Green College, where he built his library from scratch. </p> <p>A number of honours were granted him in appreciation of his contribution to psychiatry and literature. He was elected emeritus fellow of Green College (1984), fellow of the Royal Society of Literature (1990), and honorary fellow of the Royal College of Psychiatrists (1993). The generosity of spirit, so apparent in his writing, was no less evident in his personality, and was freely expressed in the warm support and encouragement he gave to younger psychiatrists, psychotherapists and writers, as well as to the patients who came to consult him from all walks of life. </p> <p>Storr was twice married, first to Catherine Cole (the writer Catherine Storr, Obituary, January 11 2001), with whom he had three daughters before a divorce in 1970. They survive him, as does his second wife, Catherine Peters. </p> <p>\u0095 Charles Anthony Storr, psych-iatrist and writer, born May 18 1920; died March 17 2001</p>",

      "bodyText": "A management expert appointed to lead Greg Dyke's transformation of the BBC's culture of bureaucracy is to quit after little more than a year in the job. Gareth Jones, who advises on how to tackle the most difficult corporate problems, is understood to have found his task at the BBC too frustrating. BBC sources confirmed last night that his decision to leave would be announced today. Mr Jones is credited with the \"flower petals\" management structure introduced by Mr Dyke last year. The \"one BBC\" plan was designed to bring management closer to staff. Mr Jones, a surprise appointment as director of human resources, made his name with a book called The Character of a Corporation: how your company's culture can make or break your business. Before joining the BBC, he was professor of organisational development at Henley management college, and worked as a consultant at Pearson Television, when Mr Dyke was chief executive there. A BBC source said last night that Mr Jones had found his time at the corporation \"frustrating\". Over the past year Mr Dyke has attempted significant changes in the organisational culture of the BBC. He has tried to make himself more accessible to staff through open meetings, and communicates most often through emails signed simply \"Greg\". Many changes have been welcomed by staff. Mr Dyke has instigated plans to divert millions of pounds from the administration to programme budgets. But the windfall for programmes is yet to bear fruit. The BBC's Sunday night drama series, in particular, are suffering from poor ratings.",

Europeans now spend more than three hours a day watching television and TV viewing has risen in every European country, in some cases by nearly 100%. The Italians and Spanish watch the most at just over four hours per day but the British are not far behind with just over 3.5 hours. Published today, the research gives the lie to the widespread expectation that the internet boom would lead to a drop in TV viewing. They form part of a major study into European media consumption by the World Advertising Research Centre and media agency The Media Edge. In the last three years, the number of people using the internet has grown from a European average of fewer than one in 10 - 8.8% - to more than a third. Those in northern countries are the highest users of the internet, while those in warmer countries are less addicted. In Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland more than 50% of the population claims to be a regular user. The UK also performs well with 46% of the population using the internet. But there is still a big north/south divide, with just 12% and 11% of Spanish and Italians respectively describing themselves as \"regular\" users. As well as spending more time in front of the TV or on the internet, European consumers are increasingly being bombarded with junk mail. The survey found that Europeans receive an average of 74 items of direct mail, with the Swiss getting a massive 211 items - nearly 18 every month. Surprising though it may seem, the British get off lightly with an average of just 68 items a year. But Britain has lost its position as the best-read country in Europe. Ten years ago Britain had Europe's highest national daily newspaper circulation figures in Europe, with 40.5% of the population reading a paper every day. By 1999 that figure was down to 31.4%, while Germany, which has seen the consumption of national newspapers double in the past 10 years, now has a figure of 39.1%. \"Today's typical European consumer is not only exposed to more channels of communication than ever before, from mobile, to satellite and cable, to internet, but also actively consumes more media than ever before,\" said Charles Courtier, managing director for Europe, the middle east and Africa at The Media Edge. \"With the arrival of widespread digital technology, he or she will be able to exercise more control of what, when, and how they consume,\" he said.

Mr Brown later forced Lord Burns out of his job.</p> <p>Convinced that the Mail is acting in desperation to prevent another Labour election landslide the Downing Street spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said: \"They are in a complete rage because they are not having much effect.\" Pointedly throughout yesterday he and his deputies said: \"Geoffrey Robinson is no longer a member of the government.\"</p> <p>Rather that face a fresh Commons inquiry over the possibility that he lied to them, some MPs predicted that the millionaire businessman would also quit as MP for Coventry North-West before polling day. But ministers fear the spread of the \"sleaze\" contagion.</p> <p>Contrary to Mr Robinson's repeated denials to Tony Blair and the Commons standards and privileges committee, restated by the MP again last night, Mr Bower reproduced an invoice marked \"Paid\".</p> <p>It appears to show that the MP solicited and later obtained the \u00a3200,000 payment from Mr Maxwell's Pergamon group in late 1990 as a management payment for his role in Hollis, a now bankrupt firm that both Maxwell and Mr Robinson's companies owned at different times.</p> <p>The cheque, which has never been traced, was made payable \"personally\" to Mr Robinson, though Mr Bower claims the MP admitted its existence in a face-to-face showdown over breakfast at the Grosvenor House hotel, where the MP has a penthouse flat. The reason for Mr Byers' involvement, and Downing Street's anger, is Mr Bower's claim that the key facts were laid out by the DTI inspector, Hugh Aldous, in December 1999, but not published the same month because they would embarrass ministers.</p> <p>Instead Mr Byers issued a brief answer saying that after \"thorough inquiries\" the DTI would take no further action. In a statement yesterday the department made two key points:</p> <p>\u0095 That the inquiry, set up the month after Mr Byers took over from Mr Mandelson, was conducted at every stage by civil servants without ministerial involvement.</p> <p>\u0095 That its findings cannot be published because it was conducted under section 447 of the 1985 Companies Act which precludes publication lest the commercial interests of the company involved are \"unfairly damaged\".</p> <p>The Daily Mail's report therefore amounted to defamation of Mr Byers, the DTI said. Mr Campbell said: \"He is consulting his lawyer to see what kind of cheque the Daily Mail may be sending to charity.\"</p> <p>But Mr Bower, a veteran investigative reporter, declined to back down.</p> <p>\"I take note that Stephen Byers has not denied that Hugh Aldous reported that Geoffrey Robinson misled parliament and that Byers, by not announcing that issue of public interest, allowed Robinson to declare that he had been exhonerated by the report. I do not think he would have taken that decision without consultation,\" he said.</p> <p>David Heathcoat-Amory, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, countered the DTI's defence by saying that after he had demanded an independent inquiry in 1998-99 no mention was ever made of either point in letters from Mr Byers. He called the official version \"complete sophistry\" and has written to Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, asking her to reopen her own inquiries.</p> <p>MPs indicated last night that that is likely if it proves necessary to ask Mr Robinson \"if he wishes to add anything to the evidence he has already given\".</p> <p>Mr Robinson issued his own denial yesterday. \"Today's story has failed to present any new information. The claim that I was paid \u00a3200,000 as chairman of Hollis Industries has been made before and was fully investigated by the DTI who have today made their position clear about the Bower story,\" he said.</p> <p>\"My own position has been absolutely clear throughout: neither I nor any company associated with me received this money.\"</p>",

Raising the stakes, the Mail issued a 12-point challenge to Mr Byers which it couples today with Mr Bower's account of how the Treasury's former permanent secretary, Lord Burns, was \"intimidated\" to protect Mr Robinson's job before he was forced out in December 1998 over Peter Mandelson's \u00a3373,000 home loan. Mr Brown later forced Lord Burns out of his job. Convinced that the Mail is acting in desperation to prevent another Labour election landslide the Downing Street spokesman, Alastair Campbell, said: \"They are in a complete rage because they are not having much effect.\" Pointedly throughout yesterday he and his deputies said: \"Geoffrey Robinson is no longer a member of the government.\" Rather that face a fresh Commons inquiry over the possibility that he lied to them, some MPs predicted that the millionaire businessman would also quit as MP for Coventry North-West before polling day. But ministers fear the spread of the \"sleaze\" contagion. Contrary to Mr Robinson's repeated denials to Tony Blair and the Commons standards and privileges committee, restated by the MP again last night, Mr Bower reproduced an invoice marked \"Paid\". It appears to show that the MP solicited and later obtained the \u00a3200,000 payment from Mr Maxwell's Pergamon group in late 1990 as a management payment for his role in Hollis, a now bankrupt firm that both Maxwell and Mr Robinson's companies owned at different times. The cheque, which has never been traced, was made payable \"personally\" to Mr Robinson, though Mr Bower claims the MP admitted its existence in a face-to-face showdown over breakfast at the Grosvenor House hotel, where the MP has a penthouse flat. The reason for Mr Byers' involvement, and Downing Street's anger, is Mr Bower's claim that the key facts were laid out by the DTI inspector, Hugh Aldous, in December 1999, but not published the same month because they would embarrass ministers. Instead Mr Byers issued a brief answer saying that after \"thorough inquiries\" the DTI would take no further action. In a statement yesterday the department made two key points: \u0095 That the inquiry, set up the month after Mr Byers took over from Mr Mandelson, was conducted at every stage by civil servants without ministerial involvement. \u0095 That its findings cannot be published because it was conducted under section 447 of the 1985 Companies Act which precludes publication lest the commercial interests of the company involved are \"unfairly damaged\". The Daily Mail's report therefore amounted to defamation of Mr Byers, the DTI said. Mr Campbell said: \"He is consulting his lawyer to see what kind of cheque the Daily Mail may be sending to charity.\" But Mr Bower, a veteran investigative reporter, declined to back down. \"I take note that Stephen Byers has not denied that Hugh Aldous reported that Geoffrey Robinson misled parliament and that Byers, by not announcing that issue of public interest, allowed Robinson to declare that he had been exhonerated by the report. I do not think he would have taken that decision without consultation,\" he said. David Heathcoat-Amory, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, countered the DTI's defence by saying that after he had demanded an independent inquiry in 1998-99 no mention was ever made of either point in letters from Mr Byers. He called the official version \"complete sophistry\" and has written to Elizabeth Filkin, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, asking her to reopen her own inquiries. MPs indicated last night that that is likely if it proves necessary to ask Mr Robinson \"if he wishes to add anything to the evidence he has already given\". Mr Robinson issued his own denial yesterday. \"Today's story has failed to present any new information. The claim that I was paid \u00a3200,000 as chairman of Hollis Industries has been made before and was fully investigated by the DTI who have today made their position clear about the Bower story,\" he said. \"My own position has been absolutely clear throughout: neither I nor any company associated with me received this money.\"",

Where privatisation was once seen as a panacea for the problems of the public sector it is now appears to be dead as a populist political force. The figures show that this is not just the view, as might be expected, of Labour and Liberal Democrat voters, but is also widely held by many Conservative voters.</p> <p>The ICM poll also demonstrates that the public do agree that, in general, public sector workers are underpaid and undervalued and they also strongly want to see a measure of respect restored to those who work in the public service. An overwhelming 75% say that society has less respect now than it did 20 years ago for those who work in the public sector.</p> <p>The extent to which the pendulum has swung against the privatisation culture is demonstrated by the 76% who say they want to see the railways brought back into the public sector and is nearly matched by the 60% who want to see an end to private prisons. </p> <p>Many of the massive flotations of the 1980s now appear to be part of the cross-party consensus. While there is overwhelming support to bring the railways and prisons back into public ownership the same cannot be said for the telecommunications industry. Some 48% say BT should be left as it is and only 40% say it should be renationalised, with Labour voters split evenly down the middle.</p> <p>But, surprisingly, when voters are asked about the principle of public service there is overwhelming support for the idea that in general public services should not be run for profit. Interestingly the \"not for profit\" principle transcends the political parties with 61% of Tory voters supporting the idea alongside 68% of Labour and 64% of Liberal Democrat voters. It also crosses the age groups and social classes.</p> <p>The anti-privatisation swing in the public mood is confirmed by strong opposition to the government's proposals to privatise the national air traffic control service, with 72% disapproving of the idea and only 14% of Labour and 14% of Conservative voters thinking it a good move.</p> <p>This support for the public service and the not-for-profit principle now appears to be a genuine cross-party consensus. So while generally 61% of all voters say they agree that public services should always or usually be run by the government or by local authorities it is a view which is also shared by 52% of Conservative voters. Only 13% of Tory voters say they agree with the view that public services should always or usually be run by private companies - a salutory thought for the more diehard Adam Smith wing of the Conservative party.</p> <p>But there is no cause for celebration for the Labour government either. It's favoured approach of \"public-private sector partnerships\" only draws support from 25% of voters and is more popular amongst Tory voters (32%) than among its own supporters (23%).</p> <p><strong>Perceptions of pay</strong></p> <p>The ICM poll shows that half the public believes that public sector workers are underpaid compared with those doing similar jobs in the private sector. Only 8% say they are overpaid with one in four saying they are \"paid about right\". The feeling is strongest in the south of England where 60% say public sector workers are underpaid and weakest in the north where it falls to 40%.</p> <p>Despite the fact that the overall size of the public sector has shrunk in the last 20 years the fact that one in three families includes someone who works in the public services shows what a significant political force it remains.</p> <p>The fact that public sector workers are seen as underpaid however has to be tempered by the results which were given when those surveyed were asked how much they thought an experienced classroom teacher, nurse and police officer outside London were paid. In each case the average given: \u00a317,330 for a staff nurse, \u00a319,010 for a classroom teacher and \u00a320,540 for a police officer, was a good \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000 below the current figure for these core public sector workers outside London. The results seem to indicate that voters are three to four years out of date when it comes to their knowledge of public sector pay settlements as all these three groups have had significant above-inflation pay increases in the past three years.</p> <p><strong>A flat 'no' to more tax </strong></p> <p>Usually when opinion pollsters pose the question, the public overwhelmingly says it is willing to pay extra in taxes to pay for improvements in public services. The conventional political wisdom is that these people lie to the pollsters and promptly vote for the party that is most likely to deliver them tax cuts. In this case the voters appear to have taken a more honest line. When asked if they would be prepared to pay more tax so that those who worked in the public sector were better paid, a majority, 54%, flatly said they were not. Only one in three was willing to pay more. Even amongst Liberal Democrat voters, whose party renewed its pledge at the weekend to put a penny on income tax to pay for improved education, some 55% said they were not prepared to pay more in tax to fund salary increases for public service workers.</p> <p>In fact, as last month's Guardian/ICM poll showed, the voters now see very little difference between the tax and spend policies of either Labour or the Conservatives. The voters regard both parties as equally likely to raise taxes. Only 24% now expect that Labour will spend more than the Tories if they are re-elected and in fact, more voters, some 29%, believe that the Tories would spend more than Labour.</p> <p>As this month's special Guardian/ICM poll shows there is overwhelming trust and support for public services now in Britain but at the same time there is widespread scepticism that a second term Labour government will bring a big boost in public spending.</p> <p>\u0095 ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18 and over by telephone between March 16-18 2001. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.</p>",

Only 13% of Tory voters say they agree with the view that public services should always or usually be run by private companies - a salutory thought for the more diehard Adam Smith wing of the Conservative party. But there is no cause for celebration for the Labour government either. It's favoured approach of \"public-private sector partnerships\" only draws support from 25% of voters and is more popular amongst Tory voters (32%) than among its own supporters (23%). Perceptions of pay The ICM poll shows that half the public believes that public sector workers are underpaid compared with those doing similar jobs in the private sector. Only 8% say they are overpaid with one in four saying they are \"paid about right\". The feeling is strongest in the south of England where 60% say public sector workers are underpaid and weakest in the north where it falls to 40%. Despite the fact that the overall size of the public sector has shrunk in the last 20 years the fact that one in three families includes someone who works in the public services shows what a significant political force it remains. The fact that public sector workers are seen as underpaid however has to be tempered by the results which were given when those surveyed were asked how much they thought an experienced classroom teacher, nurse and police officer outside London were paid. In each case the average given: \u00a317,330 for a staff nurse, \u00a319,010 for a classroom teacher and \u00a320,540 for a police officer, was a good \u00a33,000 to \u00a34,000 below the current figure for these core public sector workers outside London. The results seem to indicate that voters are three to four years out of date when it comes to their knowledge of public sector pay settlements as all these three groups have had significant above-inflation pay increases in the past three years. A flat 'no' to more tax Usually when opinion pollsters pose the question, the public overwhelmingly says it is willing to pay extra in taxes to pay for improvements in public services. The conventional political wisdom is that these people lie to the pollsters and promptly vote for the party that is most likely to deliver them tax cuts. In this case the voters appear to have taken a more honest line. When asked if they would be prepared to pay more tax so that those who worked in the public sector were better paid, a majority, 54%, flatly said they were not. Only one in three was willing to pay more. Even amongst Liberal Democrat voters, whose party renewed its pledge at the weekend to put a penny on income tax to pay for improved education, some 55% said they were not prepared to pay more in tax to fund salary increases for public service workers. In fact, as last month's Guardian/ICM poll showed, the voters now see very little difference between the tax and spend policies of either Labour or the Conservatives. The voters regard both parties as equally likely to raise taxes. Only 24% now expect that Labour will spend more than the Tories if they are re-elected and in fact, more voters, some 29%, believe that the Tories would spend more than Labour. As this month's special Guardian/ICM poll shows there is overwhelming trust and support for public services now in Britain but at the same time there is widespread scepticism that a second term Labour government will bring a big boost in public spending. \u0095 ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,001 adults aged 18 and over by telephone between March 16-18 2001. Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults.",

      "body": "<p>Future lexicographers, looking back at the period from the end of Thatcher to the zenith of Blair, will observe symptomatic slippages in the language of civic discourse.</p> <p>Britain has never, in modern times, had a handy term for \"the public good\". William Morris's archaism \"Commonweal\" came nearest, perhaps. But it doesn't trip off the tongue as easily as the French bien commun.</p> <p>The cluster of words associated with the public or common good which are currently available to English speakers have, palpably, shrunk in potency over the last few administrations. They no longer resonate as they once did; bells without clappers.</p> <p>Say \"service\", for example, and most will think nowadays of \"service sector\" - that booming segment of the modern white collar economy where greed (\"wealth creation\") is good. The service sector does not \"serve\" (in the Miltonic sense of \"They also serve\") any more than the modern \"armed services\" serve. It \"works\" - with robotic efficiency.</p> <p>Sometimes the perversion is officially authorised. As rail passengers have become \"customers\" (defined solely by cash nexus; going nowhere, paying something) so Whitehall approves the term \"social entrepreneurs\" for \"public servants\". (For many decades now, \"enterprise\" has been the favoured euphemism for \"capitalism\"). In such usages, human relations are - to coin a brutalism - \"marketised\". \"Benefit\" (doing good to others) is reified into \"monetary handout. Pieces of silver\".</p> <p>A whole range of other formerly big words have lost their big resonances. In 1946 the compound \"welfare state\" was, in Orwell's Newspeak, \"doubleplusgood\". Men and women would have died for it (this, as John Ruskin observed in Unto This Last, is the acid test of any social ideal).</p> <p>The first element, \"welfare\", has been subverted over the last 20 years by conjunction with \"queen\" (in the US) and \"fraud\" (in the UK). The word \"state\" nowadays throws back the jeeringly inevitable echo \"nanny\". \"Welfare state\" is now, even for the Labour party whose grand historic achievement it was, obscurely shameful. A pejorative for our times.</p> <p>In the 1960s debate, led by Richard Hoggart and Raymond Williams (liberal and Marxist leftist respectively), \"culture\" was an unequivocal plus word. A summum bonum. It has been corroded by such routine modern usage as \"culture of neglect\", \"compensation culture\", or \"culture of racism\". Another pejorative.</p> <p>And if - as our spokespeople incessantly have - you vilify \"institutionalised racism\", can you ever again invoke, with Bagehotian approval, our glorious British institutions? Or, after the (legitimate) scorn heaped on \"community care\" (for the undenizened mentally ill) can you invoke, nostalgically, Weberian Gemeinschaft - the harmony of the wheelwright's shop? \"Community\" is not a pejorative: merely a vacuum, a non-entity. Its place is taken by a fund of \"social capital\" (monstrous hybrid). </p> <p>And if the beautiful word asylum is indelibly linked to \"bogus\" can it ever again mean \"place of refuge or asylum\"? </p> <p>Thatcher victrix. It is not just \"society\" that has been annihilated as a linguistic referent, but a whole range of connected ideals which dignified political discourse and motivated civic behaviour (\"service\", so to call it). Current \"strong words\" are paralysing negatives: \"sceptic\" (\"Eurosceptic\"); \"stealth\" (with Proudhonian suggestion that all tax is theft); \"sleaze\"; \"bogus\"; the \"cash-for\" prefix and the \"-gate\" suffix.</p> <p>One of the favourite terms of politicians applauding themselves is \"robust\" (as in \"our response to this issue will be prompt and robust\"). But the vocabulary of modern life, where it touches on the realities of social existence, is chronically un-robust.</p> <p>The \"poor\" we always have. But no modern politician is wholly comfortable with the blunt term. \"Underclass\" had a brief vogue, until its Nietzschean connotations of an irredeemably \"lumpen\" mass poked through.</p> <p>We prefer to see \"poverty\" as a condition you can be \"lifted out of\". The \"indigent\" (or, as the Victorians robustly called them, \"able-bodied paupers\") are reworded as \"the homeless\" or \"rough sleepers\" (a conjunction that evokes Teddy Roosevelt's cavalry charging up the hill at Santiago). The \"workshy\" are the \"long-term unemployed\". Only the truly ugly (racists, Neo-Nazis, skin-heads and rednecks) have the privilege of robust language. </p> <p>It is the responsibility of politicians and parties to work for the public good.

      "bodyText": "Future lexicographers, looking back at the period from the end of Thatcher to the zenith of Blair, will observe symptomatic slippages in the language of civic discourse. Britain has never, in modern times, had a handy term for \"the public good\". William Morris's archaism \"Commonweal\" came nearest, perhaps. But it doesn't trip off the tongue as easily as the French bien commun. The cluster of words associated with the public or common good which are currently available to English speakers have, palpably, shrunk in potency over the last few administrations. They no longer resonate as they once did; bells without clappers. Say \"service\", for example, and most will think nowadays of \"service sector\" - that booming segment of the modern white collar economy where greed (\"wealth creation\") is good. The service sector does not \"serve\" (in the Miltonic sense of \"They also serve\") any more than the modern \"armed services\" serve. It \"works\" - with robotic efficiency. Sometimes the perversion is officially authorised. As rail passengers have become \"customers\" (defined solely by cash nexus; going nowhere, paying something) so Whitehall approves the term \"social entrepreneurs\" for \"public servants\". (For many decades now, \"enterprise\" has been the favoured euphemism for \"capitalism\"). In such usages, human relations are - to coin a brutalism - \"marketised\". \"Benefit\" (doing good to others) is reified into \"monetary handout. Pieces of silver\". A whole range of other formerly big words have lost their big resonances. In 1946 the compound \"welfare state\" was, in Orwell's Newspeak, \"doubleplusgood\". Men and women would have died for it (this, as John Ruskin observed in Unto This Last, is the acid test of any social ideal). The first element, \"welfare\", has been subverted over the last 20 years by conjunction with \"queen\" (in the US) and \"fraud\" (in the UK). The word \"state\" nowadays throws back the jeeringly inevitable echo \"nanny\". \"Welfare state\" is now, even for the Labour party whose grand historic achievement it was, obscurely shameful. A pejorative for our times. In the 1960s debate, led by Richard Hoggart and Raymond Williams (liberal and Marxist leftist respectively), \"culture\" was an unequivocal plus word. A summum bonum. It has been corroded by such routine modern usage as \"culture of neglect\", \"compensation culture\", or \"culture of racism\". Another pejorative. And if - as our spokespeople incessantly have - you vilify \"institutionalised racism\", can you ever again invoke, with Bagehotian approval, our glorious British institutions? Or, after the (legitimate) scorn heaped on \"community care\" (for the undenizened mentally ill) can you invoke, nostalgically, Weberian Gemeinschaft - the harmony of the wheelwright's shop? \"Community\" is not a pejorative: merely a vacuum, a non-entity. Its place is taken by a fund of \"social capital\" (monstrous hybrid). And if the beautiful word asylum is indelibly linked to \"bogus\" can it ever again mean \"place of refuge or asylum\"? Thatcher victrix. It is not just \"society\" that has been annihilated as a linguistic referent, but a whole range of connected ideals which dignified political discourse and motivated civic behaviour (\"service\", so to call it). Current \"strong words\" are paralysing negatives: \"sceptic\" (\"Eurosceptic\"); \"stealth\" (with Proudhonian suggestion that all tax is theft); \"sleaze\"; \"bogus\"; the \"cash-for\" prefix and the \"-gate\" suffix. One of the favourite terms of politicians applauding themselves is \"robust\" (as in \"our response to this issue will be prompt and robust\"). But the vocabulary of modern life, where it touches on the realities of social existence, is chronically un-robust. The \"poor\" we always have. But no modern politician is wholly comfortable with the blunt term. \"Underclass\" had a brief vogue, until its Nietzschean connotations of an irredeemably \"lumpen\" mass poked through. We prefer to see \"poverty\" as a condition you can be \"lifted out of\". The \"indigent\" (or, as the Victorians robustly called them, \"able-bodied paupers\") are reworded as \"the homeless\" or \"rough sleepers\" (a conjunction that evokes Teddy Roosevelt's cavalry charging up the hill at Santiago). The \"workshy\" are the \"long-term unemployed\". Only the truly ugly (racists, Neo-Nazis, skin-heads and rednecks) have the privilege of robust language. It is the responsibility of politicians and parties to work for the public good. What is striking about governments of the present era is how an ideology of nervousness (\"prudence\") has been inscribed into their core rhetoric. They habitually decline to put anything right. Instead they undertake to \"address\" the problem. \"Address\" commits you to nothing more than careful inspection. In the face of a disaster for which someone in authority bears manifest responsibility (some awful expos\u00e9 from the prisons, hospitals, or children's homes) we are piously assured, not that measures will be taken, but that \"lessons have been learned\". That is, a good resolution is made for the future. The present custodians of the common good, in their linguistic soul, see themselves as doing or making nothing. They merely \"deliver\" (or \"roll out\", as one might lay a carpet) what, by implication, others have done or made. They aspire no higher than to be a kind of service provider or political parcel force: getting the goods (common or otherwise) from there to here. \u0095 John Sutherland is professor of English at University College, London.",

The perception of women shifted from being erratic, irrational and dangerous (witches and shrews) to being the spiritual superiors of men, civilising, emotionally sustaining and binding of families and communities. In the 19th century, they were expected to play this role solely in the home, but in the 20th century they moved out to play this role in public also and women make up over 70% of the public sector workforce, dominating the nation's caring and implementing the vision of the common good from running parks to housing estates. The welfare state is the angel state, it's promise to care for you from cradle to grave is delivered largely by women.</p> <p>This 19th-century definition of women as emotional labourers is evident in many of the interviews published on these pages. Again and again, women emphasise the emotional rewards of their work. Often their whole sense of identity is bound up with caring, so Catherine Coogan, a home carer, describes a life of seamless caring: \"Before being a home carer, I was a wife and mother nursing is something which my family does - you could say that caring runs in the family.\" The relationships formed among fellow public servants and with the public is the main source of job satisfaction. Rhian Wood, an A&amp;E acting nurse manager, says she loves nursing, \"It's such a rewarding job you build up close relationships very fast.\"</p> <p>It is this emotional engagement - sometimes in exceptionally difficult circumstances - which women talk about readily, rather than pay.

Janice Edmonds, a nursery nurse, professes not to notice her pay rises much. Irene Lucas, director of city contracting services, is absolutely clear: \"I'm not remotely concerned about remuneration, it comes way down my list of priorities.\"</p> <p>Vocation is a word which springs quickly to many of these women's lips. Vocation comes from the Latin to call; it is a Christian concept of being called by God to undertake a particular task or service in your life. The Christianity may have disappeared, but what has persisted is the idea of a profound sense of personal purpose, and doing what you should be doing with your life. At its best, that purpose and usefulness can enrich a sense of value and belonging in the world, as many of these women indicate. </p> <p>At its worst, the concept of vocation reinforces the poor deal which emotional labour earns from the public purse. If the government took half of its rhetoric on the gender pay gap seriously, it could go a long way to solving the problem overnight by increasing the pay of its millions of female public sector workers. Professions dominated by women are always underpaid - the most notorious case being that of the mostly female NHS speech therapists who have recently won their case for a pay review. Even more disturbing is the evidence that when women enter new professions in significant numbers, pay levels drop. Work done by women is consistently discriminated against - if a woman can do the job, the job loses status and pay - and women to some extent collude with this, conforming to a gender identity of being caring and unmaterialistic. The result is that the angel state has been a public sector on the cheap, subsidised by women's aspirations to virtue.</p> <p>Lynn Punter, a rehabilitation worker, puts this conflict over pay and vocation graphically: \"I'm paid just under \u00a320,000 a year and I'm quite happy. I dealt with it a long time ago.

How do you quantify empathy, patience, forbearance and intuition? The single, biggest complaint emerging from these women's interviews is that their work is marginalised and unappreciated in the rush to improve \"efficiency\" which is measured by such things as throughput.

      "body": "<p>The splendidly monickered <a href=\"http://www.societytheguardian.com/commongood/story/0,8150,459493,00.html\">Lascelles Freckleton</a> does not quite fit Margaret Thatcher's image of a government worker: he is waging war on fat in a public gym. It's a war this fitness instructor, who earns \u00a35 an hour, doesn't believe he could pursue as effectively in a private health club. In the public gym he doesn't need to sell the \"body beautiful\", he's not pushing a product, he can deal honestly with just how fat we are. So he has turned down private offers that would net him a much bigger salary.</p> <p>Reviled in the Thatcher years as people who couldn't cut it in business, or perhaps worse, as starry-eyed do-gooders, public servants were themselves put on a starvation diet, heckled by auditors and assessers, or forced to wring profits out of good works. The most consistent, and most surprising, finding of the Guardian's interviews with public service workers lies in the immense gap between what \"reformers\" of the public sector say it is like, and the ways workers actually doing the work see themselves.</p> <p>Scientists in white lab coats and clip-boards did not conduct this survey; instead, the Guardian's journalist-army fanned out over the country, posing some simple questions to nearly 200 public servants: what do you earn, what's your job like, what are your problems? The answers come from bigwigs managing billions of pounds or thousands of workers, as well as from proles cleaning toilets; the work spans flying military planes, handling elephants in zoos, herding the public in museums, as well as teaching, medicine, and that b\u00eate noir of the reformers, social work.</p> <p><strong>Edgy and evasive</strong></p> <p>The numbers could have been even bigger, but the political traumas of public service have made many offices edgy. The Royal Mint, for instance, whose PR is farmed out to a private firm, proved evasive; a flack for the Home Office, when asked if a journalist could interview a cleaner, replied: \"We do ministers, not cleaners.\" Many individuals feared speaking out - a midwife in an NHS hospital thought being frank about the hospital's problems would lead to professional punishment, so there was no use in talking.</p> <p>The sceptical, if not outright punitive, climate of public service \"reform\" influences in a subcutaneous way those who do speak out. They are almost relentlessly upbeat. Of course they want to emphasise the value of the work they do. But even more, they want to make clear that they are not private-sector castoffs.</p> <p>Thus Michael Foot, managing director of the financial services authority, who makes a whopping \u00a3235,000, emphasises that he could earn something like 10 times that amount in an American investment bank, but finds public-sector work more challenging and interesting. With very few exceptions, from top to bottom, the public servants say they are in it neither for money nor for security: their work is, if anything, demanding or stressful as well as badly paid.</p> <p>The British public sector is smaller than the Italian and bigger than the American, but its peculiarities have to do with quality rather than quantity. The Italian civil service is truly a sink-hole of uncles, nephews, and political cronies; its productivity is appalling. The American civil service is more efficient, but also more of a revolving door, employees coming and going between the public and the private sector.</p> <p>The British public sector is both relatively efficient and a service in which people make life-long careers. The dustmen who appear in the Guardian survey think of themselves pursuing a career as much as do teachers; tasks may change in time, but the work has a fixed institutional frame.</p> <p>In this, public-sector work differs from the leading edge of modern capitalism, the flexible private sector in which workers are constantly \"rebranding\" themselves, flitting from employer to employer, from one kind of work to another. When public service work is privatised and made short-term, as in the BBC where many people work on three-month contracts, the result can seem catastrophic, entailing a personal loss of focus or preventing just the opportunity to do worthwhile things which have, however, no immediate profit reward.</p> <p>It's striking to me in this regard that almost no one in these interviews talks about their unions. In Italy, public sector unions are conspirators with the state in immobilising public services; in the US public-sector unions frequently set the quality agenda in confrontations with government.

      "bodyText": "The splendidly monickered Lascelles Freckleton does not quite fit Margaret Thatcher's image of a government worker: he is waging war on fat in a public gym. It's a war this fitness instructor, who earns \u00a35 an hour, doesn't believe he could pursue as effectively in a private health club. In the public gym he doesn't need to sell the \"body beautiful\", he's not pushing a product, he can deal honestly with just how fat we are. So he has turned down private offers that would net him a much bigger salary. Reviled in the Thatcher years as people who couldn't cut it in business, or perhaps worse, as starry-eyed do-gooders, public servants were themselves put on a starvation diet, heckled by auditors and assessers, or forced to wring profits out of good works. The most consistent, and most surprising, finding of the Guardian's interviews with public service workers lies in the immense gap between what \"reformers\" of the public sector say it is like, and the ways workers actually doing the work see themselves. Scientists in white lab coats and clip-boards did not conduct this survey; instead, the Guardian's journalist-army fanned out over the country, posing some simple questions to nearly 200 public servants: what do you earn, what's your job like, what are your problems? The answers come from bigwigs managing billions of pounds or thousands of workers, as well as from proles cleaning toilets; the work spans flying military planes, handling elephants in zoos, herding the public in museums, as well as teaching, medicine, and that b\u00eate noir of the reformers, social work. Edgy and evasive The numbers could have been even bigger, but the political traumas of public service have made many offices edgy. The Royal Mint, for instance, whose PR is farmed out to a private firm, proved evasive; a flack for the Home Office, when asked if a journalist could interview a cleaner, replied: \"We do ministers, not cleaners.\" Many individuals feared speaking out - a midwife in an NHS hospital thought being frank about the hospital's problems would lead to professional punishment, so there was no use in talking. The sceptical, if not outright punitive, climate of public service \"reform\" influences in a subcutaneous way those who do speak out. They are almost relentlessly upbeat. Of course they want to emphasise the value of the work they do. But even more, they want to make clear that they are not private-sector castoffs. Thus Michael Foot, managing director of the financial services authority, who makes a whopping \u00a3235,000, emphasises that he could earn something like 10 times that amount in an American investment bank, but finds public-sector work more challenging and interesting. With very few exceptions, from top to bottom, the public servants say they are in it neither for money nor for security: their work is, if anything, demanding or stressful as well as badly paid. The British public sector is smaller than the Italian and bigger than the American, but its peculiarities have to do with quality rather than quantity. The Italian civil service is truly a sink-hole of uncles, nephews, and political cronies; its productivity is appalling. The American civil service is more efficient, but also more of a revolving door, employees coming and going between the public and the private sector. The British public sector is both relatively efficient and a service in which people make life-long careers. The dustmen who appear in the Guardian survey think of themselves pursuing a career as much as do teachers; tasks may change in time, but the work has a fixed institutional frame. In this, public-sector work differs from the leading edge of modern capitalism, the flexible private sector in which workers are constantly \"rebranding\" themselves, flitting from employer to employer, from one kind of work to another. When public service work is privatised and made short-term, as in the BBC where many people work on three-month contracts, the result can seem catastrophic, entailing a personal loss of focus or preventing just the opportunity to do worthwhile things which have, however, no immediate profit reward. It's striking to me in this regard that almost no one in these interviews talks about their unions. In Italy, public sector unions are conspirators with the state in immobilising public services; in the US public-sector unions frequently set the quality agenda in confrontations with government. The British workers in this survey speak of themselves as more self-directed; if you didn't know who paid their salaries, you might mistake them for self-employed. The water regulator, Philip Fletcher, makes a neat distinction: \"As water regulator I am a public servant, thought what I do is very different from what I used to do as a Whitehall civil servant. Here, I run my own show.\" At a less grand level, Judy Tomkinson, the local registrar at Newcastle-under-Lyme, speaks like a Jewish matchmaker about the marriages she conducts. This feel-good factor is more than self-advertisement: there's little personal whingeing in situations of scarce resources that would entitle people high or low to whinge. Why, then, can't reformers of the public services understand what makes a fitness trainer, a cleaner, a registrar or a financial services manager tick? Part of the misunderstanding is inherited. Public service became confused at an early stage with charity work. The poor visitors of the 19th century performed a service of sorts, bringing castoff clothes to the masses along with well-meaning advice.

Nats makes a surplus now, but the important thing is that this allows us to provide a service, rather than us having the sole intention of making a profit, as all private companies have to do. There are some things that are too important to be left to private individuals and business. The first thing controllers are taught is to be safe, orderly and expeditious. That is our motto. Safety does not come from an external regulator or instruction from the government. An ethos of safety comes from within. It is not about money.",

Headteachers are notching up thousands of air miles in their search to fill classroom vacancies. Universities are struggling to keep hold of their brightest young lecturers. After four years of a Labour government, Britain's public sector exists as it has for decades, papering over the cracks and somehow surviving against the odds. </p> <p>This is the key issue at the election: how can Labour improve delivery of public services? For the first election in a generation, the big economic issue is not tax cuts. Labour has succeeded in changing the nature of the debate, with the Conservatives fighting the forthcoming election on the defensive, forced to match Labour's spending commitments. As one Treasury source said in the aftermath of the Budget: \"We have set out our vision of what we want to do for public spending and what we want to do to tackle poverty. It is up to the Tories now to say what they would do.\" </p> <p>These are important shifts, but privately Labour insiders know they have barely scratched the surface of what needs to be done. Two big challenges are looming. The first is both ideological and fundamental: what sort of left-of-centre party does Labour want to be? On the one hand, there is the American low-taxation model, where people pay their own way but where the downside is that people pay more and a city as affluent as New York City lacks a direct mass transit system into the heart of Manhattan from Kennedy airport. On the other hand there is the European model, where spending is higher and services superior, but taxes are higher. The British model sits uneasily between the two. </p> <p>For the time being, Mr Brown is in the happy position of being able to spend like a European while taxing like an American. That will not last, and here lies the second big challenge. Labour can be generous over the next three years - increasing spending by far more than the economy's trend rate of growth - because Britain has enjoyed a long period of sustained economic growth and Mr Brown donned his hairshirt in the government's early years. But that happy state of affairs may not last for ever. The storm clouds gathering in America and Japan could portend more difficult times ahead, in which high levels of spending will only be affordable if Labour is prepared to countenance higher taxation. There is not the slightest inkling that it is ready to fight this sort of bloody political battle. </p> <p><strong> Little has changed</strong></p> <p> What sharpens this as a critical test for Labour is that the truth is that the public sector under Tony Blair is little changed from the public sector under John Major. Gordon Brown has now loosened the purse strings after two years in which Labour actually spent less than the Tories had been planning, but - despite all the spin about how things are getting better - all that he has done so far is compensate for the retrenchment in 1998 and 1999. </p> <p>Kenneth Clarke can scarcely credit it. With the Tories heading for the electoral rocks in late 1986, the former Conservative chancellor tried one last roll of the dice. In his November Budget he announced minuscule increases in spending in the hope that his Labour shadow, Gordon Brown, would lose public credibility by refusing to swallow the poisoned pill. Mr Clarke was wrong. Mr Brown not only swallowed the pill, he swallowed it with relish. In order to prove his Iron Chancellor credentials, he not only kept to Mr Clarke's hideously tough plans but managed to cut public spending in inflation-adjusted terms during Labour's first two years. </p> <p>For those in the Labour party expecting instant financial relief after 18 years of Conservative rule this all came as a bit of a nasty surprise. Whatever they had voted for, it certainly was not for further cuts. Mr Clarke, who admits that he would have torn up his plans had John Major won in 1997, says that there was no economic reason to justify the squeeze on public spending in Labour's first two years. \"There was no crisis to justify it and Britain's schools and hospitals still bear the scars\", he says. </p> <p>There is a lot of truth in what Mr Clarke says. The reason the public realm looked shabby under the Conservatives compared with the gleaming edifices of the private sector was that public spending increased more slowly than the economy as a whole - by just 1.6% a year over the 18 years between 1979 and 1997. In Labour's first two years it was cut by 0.6% on average. Spending on the NHS increased by just 2.2% under Brown, compared with 3.1% under the Conservatives. Whatever is said now, these were painful decisions and they caused real damage. </p> <p>Mr Brown's argument is that he had no choice but to establish his credentials, and that he is using the hard-won credibility to start putting things right now. There is some truth in this analysis, since history is littered with the baleful stories of Labour chancellors making generous spending commitments early on and then coming off second best in battles with financial markets alarmed by the lack of economic discipline. In fact, however, Mr Brown used the power of the markets as something of a smokescreen. While the risks of a Labour government being faced with a debilitating mid-term crisis were real enough (although by no means as high as they had been in more difficult economic times) Mr Brown and his advisers had no intention of simply throwing money at schools and hospitals. They believed that first they had to counter the prevailing wisdom of the Conservative years: that anything the public sector could do, the private sector could do better. </p> <p><strong> Wasteful and inefficient</strong></p> <p> Margaret Thatcher certainly had no love for the public sector, considering it to be wasteful, inefficient and in need of an injection of private-sector entrepreneurship. But she was also cutting with the prevailing cultural grain, which by the late 1970s had seen the collectivist values that had underpinned the growth of the public sector in the 1950s and 1960s eroded by the growth of individualism. The message from the films and television of the 1970s - movies such as Get Carter and O Lucky Man! - mirrored public perception of local government embroiled in Poulson-style sleaze, a police force mired in corruption, and public services that were shoddy and unresponsive to the needs of those using them. Big government, in other words, was bad government. </p> <p>The shortcomings of the Conservative approach soon became apparent. As afflu ence increased in Britain during the 1980s and 1990s, people wanted better healthcare, better schools, better universities. They also wanted better transport and safer streets. What they got instead was spending that did not match that of the economy as a whole, leading to a prolonged period of relative decline. One area where the market was not allowed to work - and is still not allowed to work - was public sector pay, where the government has used its power as a monopoly employer to keep salaries below the proper going rate, while at the same time using a barrage of targets - often indiscriminately - in an attempt to make the public sector work like the private sector. </p> <p>Labour has bought into the target-based approach, even though it is clear that some of those employed in the public sector lead to perverse outcomes, such as concentrating health resources on reducing waiting lists rather than on treating those most in need of care. </p> <p>The government's case is that by avoiding the macro-economic mistakes of the past, it is now in a position to make a sustained investment in public services. Falling debt interest payments and lower unemployment mean that more than 80p in every additional pound can go on \"productive\" public spending rather than \"wasteful\" public spending. But there is a very real risk that the public sector is so enfeebled that the surge in spending now is simply too little too late, and that Britain is now so far adrift of standards of provision elsewhere in the developed world that it will never be able to catch up. </p> <p>This is the real risk for Labour. It has done enough in its first term to win a second, but the public will be far less forgiving next time. They will expect results, not excuses.</p> <p><strong>Catalogue of decline </strong></p> <p><strong>Public spending as a % of GDP </strong></p> <p><strong>1979-80</strong> 44.8%</p> <p><strong>1988-89</strong> 39.1%</p> <p><strong>1998-99</strong> 38.5%</p> <p><strong>2003-4</strong> 40.5% (projected)</p> <p>\u0095 Spending on health grew by an average 3.1% 1979-97 and by 4.7% 1997-2001</p> <p>\u0095 Spending on education grew by 1.5% 1979-97 and by 3.6% 1997-2001</p> <p><strong>Public employment </strong></p> <p>\u0095 In 1979, the public sector employed 7,449,000</p> <p>\u0095 In 1999, the public sector employed 4,697,000</p> <p><strong>Biggest employers </strong></p> <p>\u0095 2,622,000 are employed in local government of which 1,241,000 are in education, 388,000 are in social services</p> <p>\u0095 855,000 are employed in central government</p> <p>\u0095 1,131,000 are employed in NHS trusts</p> <p><strong>Pay gap </strong></p> <p>\u0095 In 1976, a teacher earned 40% more than the average non-manual worker, today the gap is just 10%</p> <p>\u0095 In the six years since 1995, public sector pay has risen by less than 20 % compared with a rise in the private sector of over 30%</p> <p><strong>Women</strong></p> <p>Over a third of all female employees work for the public sector.

Labour can be generous over the next three years - increasing spending by far more than the economy's trend rate of growth - because Britain has enjoyed a long period of sustained economic growth and Mr Brown donned his hairshirt in the government's early years. But that happy state of affairs may not last for ever. The storm clouds gathering in America and Japan could portend more difficult times ahead, in which high levels of spending will only be affordable if Labour is prepared to countenance higher taxation. There is not the slightest inkling that it is ready to fight this sort of bloody political battle. Little has changed What sharpens this as a critical test for Labour is that the truth is that the public sector under Tony Blair is little changed from the public sector under John Major. Gordon Brown has now loosened the purse strings after two years in which Labour actually spent less than the Tories had been planning, but - despite all the spin about how things are getting better - all that he has done so far is compensate for the retrenchment in 1998 and 1999. Kenneth Clarke can scarcely credit it. With the Tories heading for the electoral rocks in late 1986, the former Conservative chancellor tried one last roll of the dice. In his November Budget he announced minuscule increases in spending in the hope that his Labour shadow, Gordon Brown, would lose public credibility by refusing to swallow the poisoned pill. Mr Clarke was wrong. Mr Brown not only swallowed the pill, he swallowed it with relish. In order to prove his Iron Chancellor credentials, he not only kept to Mr Clarke's hideously tough plans but managed to cut public spending in inflation-adjusted terms during Labour's first two years. For those in the Labour party expecting instant financial relief after 18 years of Conservative rule this all came as a bit of a nasty surprise. Whatever they had voted for, it certainly was not for further cuts. Mr Clarke, who admits that he would have torn up his plans had John Major won in 1997, says that there was no economic reason to justify the squeeze on public spending in Labour's first two years. \"There was no crisis to justify it and Britain's schools and hospitals still bear the scars\", he says. There is a lot of truth in what Mr Clarke says. The reason the public realm looked shabby under the Conservatives compared with the gleaming edifices of the private sector was that public spending increased more slowly than the economy as a whole - by just 1.6% a year over the 18 years between 1979 and 1997. In Labour's first two years it was cut by 0.6% on average. Spending on the NHS increased by just 2.2% under Brown, compared with 3.1% under the Conservatives. Whatever is said now, these were painful decisions and they caused real damage. Mr Brown's argument is that he had no choice but to establish his credentials, and that he is using the hard-won credibility to start putting things right now. There is some truth in this analysis, since history is littered with the baleful stories of Labour chancellors making generous spending commitments early on and then coming off second best in battles with financial markets alarmed by the lack of economic discipline. In fact, however, Mr Brown used the power of the markets as something of a smokescreen. While the risks of a Labour government being faced with a debilitating mid-term crisis were real enough (although by no means as high as they had been in more difficult economic times) Mr Brown and his advisers had no intention of simply throwing money at schools and hospitals. They believed that first they had to counter the prevailing wisdom of the Conservative years: that anything the public sector could do, the private sector could do better. Wasteful and inefficient Margaret Thatcher certainly had no love for the public sector, considering it to be wasteful, inefficient and in need of an injection of private-sector entrepreneurship. But she was also cutting with the prevailing cultural grain, which by the late 1970s had seen the collectivist values that had underpinned the growth of the public sector in the 1950s and 1960s eroded by the growth of individualism. The message from the films and television of the 1970s - movies such as Get Carter and O Lucky Man! - mirrored public perception of local government embroiled in Poulson-style sleaze, a police force mired in corruption, and public services that were shoddy and unresponsive to the needs of those using them. Big government, in other words, was bad government. The shortcomings of the Conservative approach soon became apparent. As afflu ence increased in Britain during the 1980s and 1990s, people wanted better healthcare, better schools, better universities. They also wanted better transport and safer streets. What they got instead was spending that did not match that of the economy as a whole, leading to a prolonged period of relative decline. One area where the market was not allowed to work - and is still not allowed to work - was public sector pay, where the government has used its power as a monopoly employer to keep salaries below the proper going rate, while at the same time using a barrage of targets - often indiscriminately - in an attempt to make the public sector work like the private sector. Labour has bought into the target-based approach, even though it is clear that some of those employed in the public sector lead to perverse outcomes, such as concentrating health resources on reducing waiting lists rather than on treating those most in need of care. The government's case is that by avoiding the macro-economic mistakes of the past, it is now in a position to make a sustained investment in public services. Falling debt interest payments and lower unemployment mean that more than 80p in every additional pound can go on \"productive\" public spending rather than \"wasteful\" public spending. But there is a very real risk that the public sector is so enfeebled that the surge in spending now is simply too little too late, and that Britain is now so far adrift of standards of provision elsewhere in the developed world that it will never be able to catch up. This is the real risk for Labour. It has done enough in its first term to win a second, but the public will be far less forgiving next time. They will expect results, not excuses. Catalogue of decline Public spending as a % of GDP 1979-80 44.8% 1988-89 39.1% 1998-99 38.5% 2003-4 40.5% (projected) \u0095 Spending on health grew by an average 3.1% 1979-97 and by 4.7% 1997-2001 \u0095 Spending on education grew by 1.5% 1979-97 and by 3.6% 1997-2001 Public employment \u0095 In 1979, the public sector employed 7,449,000 \u0095 In 1999, the public sector employed 4,697,000 Biggest employers \u0095 2,622,000 are employed in local government of which 1,241,000 are in education, 388,000 are in social services \u0095 855,000 are employed in central government \u0095 1,131,000 are employed in NHS trusts Pay gap \u0095 In 1976, a teacher earned 40% more than the average non-manual worker, today the gap is just 10% \u0095 In the six years since 1995, public sector pay has risen by less than 20 % compared with a rise in the private sector of over 30% Women Over a third of all female employees work for the public sector.

      "body": "<p><strong>The public mood is changing</strong></p> <p>Over more than 30 pages today and tomorrow we have constructed a mosaic of voices. They are men and women who are often talked about but heard only rarely. They are the voices of people who work in our public services - people who, in some fundamental sense, work for the common good. </p> <p>Why are we giving so much space, not to an election or a Budget, a royal death or a foreign war but to Britain's public services and the people who make them work? At the most elevated level, because a civilized society is judged on how it provides for its citizens. Decent public services - schools, hospitals, railways - are both prerequisites for and measures of a decent nation. They say something about who we are and how we take care of each other. </p> <p> The more immediate answer is that an election is coming - an election which may well turn on the quality of our public services. Whenever a candidate is questioned, on radio or television, he or she will routinely insist that the \"real issues people care about\" are education or health or transport. So today we are taking the politicians at their word, speaking to the people who empty our bins, teach our children, cure our sick and generally make Britain's wheels go round. It has been an ambitious project: nearly 200 Guardian journalists have interviewed a public servant - from the highest ranking diplomat to the poorest-paid school cleaner, from the celebrated museum director to the unsung local librarian. It was never meant to be a scientific survey, and inevitably there will be gaps. But the point of a mosaic is that the small fragments build towards a large picture. Those who speak here may not always work for the formal public sector but they are people who, even indirectly, serve the common good. After years of debate about them, today we have the chance to hear their voice. </p> <p>Moreover, this election demands a debate on public service more insistently than any previous contest. For this campaign has been defined by Labour as a referendum on the importance of public provision. Gordon Brown's Budget sought to present a choice to the electorate: either increased public spending under Labour or a generous tax cut under the Conservatives. The fact that Labour seems on course to win that contest marks a historic shift. After years in which voters chose tax cuts over the centre-left's promise of greater public spending, they now appear to have switched sides. A Labour victory will be a mandate to fund our national services properly. </p> <p>And now is certainly the time. For, at long last, economics and politics have come together to shine on the public realm. There is, for once, money to spend - billions of it. The chancellor speaks of a surplus close to \u00a320bn, while some believe his forecasts are, if anything, too pessimistic. The result is that even the \u00a34bn he spent in this month's Budget, including \u00a32bn extra for schools and hospitals, was deemed too cautious by City analysts Deloitte &amp; Touche: even they reckon he could have spent more! For the first time in our postwar history, Britain's problem has become how to spend it. The chancellor complains of more than \u00a37bn allocated for capital spending and a Whitehall machine that has managed to use up just \u00a32.2bn of it. It is a rare moment indeed: Britain has both the will and means to fund decent public services. </p> <p>There is a last political explanation for the urgent relevance of this debate. The Labour government is, by its own admission, staking its future on improvement of the basic social infrastructure of our country. On this, prime minister and chancellor speak with one voice, confessing that if public services are not improved by the end of their tenure they will have failed. That single objective is now the Labour \"project.\" The government will stand or fall on its achievement. As Matthew Taylor and Gavin Kelly argue in tomorrow's paper, \"If the case for universal public services cannot be won now it could be lost forever.\" </p> <p><strong>Our public services are in chaos and decay</strong></p> <p>So much for the politics. What makes this debate truly urgent within, but also far beyond, Westminster is the simple truth about our public services: that they are in a state of crisis, chaos and decay. Despite the inspiring and upbeat testimony of the public servants themselves - men and women who remain devoted to their work and to the people they help every day - it is a matter of grim consensus that too many of our core, collective needs are not met properly. We see the evidence before our eyes every day: doctors' waiting rooms jampacked with people, hospital corridors overflowing with patients on trolleys, schools turned riotous by too-large classes and too-few staff. Elsewhere in the public realm, even where funded privately, it is the same picture: rural bus routes closed, trains which arrive late or not at all. </p> <p>Alongside the anecdotal evidence there is a mountain of statistical data, some of which is charted in detail over the following pages. But to pick just a few revealing numbers. One World Health Organisation study found that up to 25,000 Britons who die of cancer each year would survive if British care were up to the best standards in the European Union. Or take education. If we were to construct a league table of EU countries, ranked according to how many over-16s are still in school, guess who comes bottom? We do, with Germany and France 20 percentage points ahead of us. A 1999 survey found that one in five British adults cannot add up the change in their pocket. </p> <p>Why are these two most basic services lagging so far behind? Here's a big clue: money. On healthcare we spend little more than a third per citizen of the amount paid out in the US and just over half the sum spent in France. We spend less than the latter because we tax less. The total tax take here for 1999 was 36.6% of GDP; in France it was 46%. </p> <p>Those numbers may explain the parlous state of our public services, but they too need an ex planation. How did Britain get itself into this mess? The answer may begin in the very origins of the modern public realm. </p> <p>The post-war era, from 1945 to 1979 may be remembered fondly now as the golden age of the public sector. It was, after all, the Attlee government which founded the NHS and expanded vastly our notion of the collective sphere by nationalising key industries. But there are important qualifiers. First, we struggled, at least after 1960, to invest on a French or German scale. While our economic growth in that period was healthy enough, at around 3%, our European neighbours were doubling that rate - and spending the money on rebuilding their infrastructure, from well-equipped schools to lean, sleek railways. Britain may have expanded higher education spending in the 60s, but the devaluation of 1967 and the IMF crisis of 1976 triggered deep cuts in public sector investment. Meanwhile France and Germany surged ahead. </p> <p>More deeply, historians now reflect that the public sector never quite put down the political, even cultural roots found on the Continent. In France the institutions of the state became intertwined with French identity itself; that never quite happened here. Principled advocacy for the ideal of public provision was scarce. Instead, the public sector became associated with incompetence and even corruption - from the Ronan Point disaster to the Poulson affair, from British Rail to the sleaze-ridden Met. Public servants were saddled with a reputation for stroppiness, laziness and unionised militancy. </p> <p>This was the soil that sprouted Thatcherism. It grew into a two-decade rundown of public services, fed by that 1970s national mood of despair. With the exception of the police, our collective agencies were put on a starvation diet, forced to do more and more work with less and less money. Teachers' pay went into freefall, sending them plummeting down the professional ladder. Doctors and nurses saw their workload increase while the buildings around them crumbled. </p> <p><strong>Blair may be missing a shift in public mood</strong></p> <p>Perhaps even more withering than the economic assault was the cultural war Thatcherism waged on the common realm. Backed by their cheerleaders in the press, Conservatism denigrated public servants - demonising teachers and social workers especially - and disparaged the very idea of public service. In the Thatcherite imagination, those who worked for the common good were losers who couldn't get a job in the private sector. For them, private was always fitter, stronger and more efficient. Since there was no such thing as society, society's members had no duty to provide for each other. We could purchase whatever we needed, not as citizens but as consumers. The 80s privatisations rammed home the message: private good, public bad. </p> <p>Many Britons hoped that era would come to an end on May 1 1997. But it has not been that simple. For one thing, Labour famously refused to give an instant blood-transfusion to the public services: instead it maintained the starvation policy by sticking to the Tories' spending limits for their first two years. They say that 24-month fast bought them the credibility they needed for a 10-year programme of renewal - but the public services paid a desperate price. </p> <p>Second, the culture of denigration has lingered on. Whether Chris Woodhead's barely-concealed disdain for teachers or Tony Blair's lament that he still bore \"the scars on [his] back\" from his battles with the public sector, much of the old, Thatcherite rhetoric still hovers in the national air. Labour's defence is that voters will only give more money to the public services when they see those services are held to strict account and are sufficiently reformed to use taxpayers' money wisely. Ministers say they remember the bad old days, when the public sector was grossly inefficient and couldn't deliver a letter - let alone decent health or education. They don't dare put Labour's fate in its hands again. </p> <p>The result is the familiar, punitive language applied to public service. Whether it be the countless performance targets laid down by Whitehall, the refusal to give a serious hike to public workers' pay or the Treasury's near-dogmatic insistence on public-private partnerships in transport and elsewhere, the message is the same: the public sector on its own cannot be trusted. Government ministers or commercial boardrooms must keep public servants on a tight leash, watching or controlling their every move. In this regard, we suspect this thoroughly modern government may be uncharacteristically out of date. For a new mood seems abroad, one that no longer believes everything public is rubbish and everything private sparkles. When Britons hear \"private\" they now think of Railtrack; that's why even 71% of Tory voters tell our pollsters today they would welcome the return of a nationalised British Rail. </p> <p>The mood is changing, moving away from the lazy caricatures of old. Over the next two days we hope to build on that shift, shedding some truer light on the public servants who make Britain work. As we hope their stories show, they are people of dedication, altruism and often bravery. Tomorrow we will look for solutions to the problem we have sought to describe here. But first we should listen to the people who form nothing less than the backbone of our country - and we should celebrate them.</p>",

It was, after all, the Attlee government which founded the NHS and expanded vastly our notion of the collective sphere by nationalising key industries. But there are important qualifiers. First, we struggled, at least after 1960, to invest on a French or German scale. While our economic growth in that period was healthy enough, at around 3%, our European neighbours were doubling that rate - and spending the money on rebuilding their infrastructure, from well-equipped schools to lean, sleek railways. Britain may have expanded higher education spending in the 60s, but the devaluation of 1967 and the IMF crisis of 1976 triggered deep cuts in public sector investment. Meanwhile France and Germany surged ahead. More deeply, historians now reflect that the public sector never quite put down the political, even cultural roots found on the Continent. In France the institutions of the state became intertwined with French identity itself; that never quite happened here. Principled advocacy for the ideal of public provision was scarce. Instead, the public sector became associated with incompetence and even corruption - from the Ronan Point disaster to the Poulson affair, from British Rail to the sleaze-ridden Met. Public servants were saddled with a reputation for stroppiness, laziness and unionised militancy. This was the soil that sprouted Thatcherism. It grew into a two-decade rundown of public services, fed by that 1970s national mood of despair. With the exception of the police, our collective agencies were put on a starvation diet, forced to do more and more work with less and less money. Teachers' pay went into freefall, sending them plummeting down the professional ladder. Doctors and nurses saw their workload increase while the buildings around them crumbled. Blair may be missing a shift in public mood Perhaps even more withering than the economic assault was the cultural war Thatcherism waged on the common realm. Backed by their cheerleaders in the press, Conservatism denigrated public servants - demonising teachers and social workers especially - and disparaged the very idea of public service. In the Thatcherite imagination, those who worked for the common good were losers who couldn't get a job in the private sector. For them, private was always fitter, stronger and more efficient. Since there was no such thing as society, society's members had no duty to provide for each other. We could purchase whatever we needed, not as citizens but as consumers. The 80s privatisations rammed home the message: private good, public bad. Many Britons hoped that era would come to an end on May 1 1997. But it has not been that simple. For one thing, Labour famously refused to give an instant blood-transfusion to the public services: instead it maintained the starvation policy by sticking to the Tories' spending limits for their first two years. They say that 24-month fast bought them the credibility they needed for a 10-year programme of renewal - but the public services paid a desperate price. Second, the culture of denigration has lingered on. Whether Chris Woodhead's barely-concealed disdain for teachers or Tony Blair's lament that he still bore \"the scars on [his] back\" from his battles with the public sector, much of the old, Thatcherite rhetoric still hovers in the national air. Labour's defence is that voters will only give more money to the public services when they see those services are held to strict account and are sufficiently reformed to use taxpayers' money wisely. Ministers say they remember the bad old days, when the public sector was grossly inefficient and couldn't deliver a letter - let alone decent health or education. They don't dare put Labour's fate in its hands again. The result is the familiar, punitive language applied to public service. Whether it be the countless performance targets laid down by Whitehall, the refusal to give a serious hike to public workers' pay or the Treasury's near-dogmatic insistence on public-private partnerships in transport and elsewhere, the message is the same: the public sector on its own cannot be trusted. Government ministers or commercial boardrooms must keep public servants on a tight leash, watching or controlling their every move. In this regard, we suspect this thoroughly modern government may be uncharacteristically out of date. For a new mood seems abroad, one that no longer believes everything public is rubbish and everything private sparkles. When Britons hear \"private\" they now think of Railtrack; that's why even 71% of Tory voters tell our pollsters today they would welcome the return of a nationalised British Rail. The mood is changing, moving away from the lazy caricatures of old. Over the next two days we hope to build on that shift, shedding some truer light on the public servants who make Britain work. As we hope their stories show, they are people of dedication, altruism and often bravery. Tomorrow we will look for solutions to the problem we have sought to describe here. But first we should listen to the people who form nothing less than the backbone of our country - and we should celebrate them.",

Assuming it wins the election in a few weeks time, can it finally break the umbilical cord of privilege, snobbery and inertia which has tied the British state to the Conservative party for more than 100 years? Can it develop a coherent social-democratic governing philosophy, capable of guiding it through the inevitable uncertainties and contingencies of government? Can it revive our battered, resource-starved public services, and breathe new life into the ethic of citizenship and service which is fundamental to the public realm?</p> <p>The third question holds the key to the first two. A substantial election victory in May is a precondition of the progressive century of Blair's dreams, but his real test will come after polling day. He has been astonishingly successful in marginalising the Conservative party, but the job is not yet done. The forces which have produced Sharon in Israel, Haider in Austria, Berlusconi in Italy and George Bush in the US have equivalents in Britain. The threat of a hard-right resurgence will not disappear until social-democratic norms permeate the public culture and the structures of the state. In his first term Blair established a bridgehead - the beginnings of a constitutional revolution; normalisation of relations with the rest of the EU; modest, but real, fiscal redistribution. It is time to follow the bridgehead with a breakthrough.</p> <p>One of the crucial objectives of such a breakthrough would be the renewal of the public services and the culture that sustains them. Social democracy and the public realm are inextricably intertwined. Without an ideologically confident and politically effective social-democratic movement to champion them, the public services are always at risk. Without a vibrant public realm, ring-fenced from the market realm, social-democratic politics cannot flourish. Public services depend on a culture of citizenship and equity - on a culture in which professional pride in a job well done or a sense of civic duty or a mixture of both replace the hope of gain and the fear of loss as spurs to action. And that is pre-eminently the culture of social democracy.</p> <p>It is now dangerously attenuated. The single most important element in the New Right project of the 1980s and 90s was a relentless Kulturkampf designed to root it out.

Public functions of all kinds were farmed out to unaccountable appointed bodies, dominated by business interests and managed according to market principles. Intermediate institutions like the BBC, the universities, the schools, museums and the health service were forced, so far as possible, into a market mould.

Incessant marketisation has done even more damage than low taxation and resource starvation. It has generated a culture of distrust, which is nibbling away at the values of professionalism, citizenship, equity and service like an acrid fog. For the marketisers, the professional, public service ethic is a con. Professionals are self-interested rent-seekers, trying to force the price of their labour above its market value. The service ethic is a device to legitimise a web of monopolistic cartels whose real purpose is to rip off the consumer. There is no point in appealing to the values of common citizenship. There are no citizens; there are only customers. Public servants are inherently untrustworthy. If they are allowed autonomy, they will abuse it. Like everyone else, they can be motivated only by sticks and carrots. If possible, privatisation must expose them to the sticks and carrots of market competition.

      "body": "<p>In 1974, when Stanley Spencer's reputation was pretty much at its nadir, the Tate bought the painter's curious \"leg of mutton\" portrait, a study in oils of a bespectacled yet otherwise naked Spencer hunkered down beside his wife, Patricia, spread-eagled on an old stripy bed in a rather uncomfortable post-coital moment. A joint of meat looks horribly raw in the foreground. </p> <p>The Tate still owns the work (Double Nude Portrait: the Artist and His Second Wife, 1937) and it's in Tate Britain's latest show. This gutsy reappraisal of this long-mocked English painter - set in a near-monastic setting designed by architect Claudio Silvestrin - attempts to elevate Spencer to the status of a Balthus, a Dix, or a Hopper. Maybe curators Patrick Wright and Timothy Hyman are right. Yet the \"leg of mutton\" portrait and the worst of Spencer's Cookham landscapes suggest he hovers awkwardly between the world of prewar London Transport posters, English whimsy, folksy religious sentiment and an embarrassingly immature attitude towards sex. </p> <p>The Tate show divides Spencer's work into key periods: before the first world war; the aftermath of the war; the 1930s, when he became rather neurotically besotted with sex; his social-realist work as war artist from 1940; and his last, haunting paintings, concerning his first wife's early death and his own impending demise from cancer. </p> <p>The early works are a cartoonish blend of Giotto and Samuel Palmer. His Last Supper is convincing: here the apostles' legs stretch under white togas as if to a fixed point under the table; with Christ at their head, they are as one, physically and spiritually. The postwar works come from the Oratory of All Souls at Burghclere, Hampshire. This gauntly awkward meeting of red-brick memorial chapel and almshouses, designed by Lionel Pearson and built between 1923 and 1927, was designed to house Spencer's canvases: his cycle of post-first world war oils depicting the psychological stresses endured by common soldiers. </p> <p>There is something wonderful about stepping into a Home Counties chapel and coming across England's own cut-price version of Giotto's Arena Chapel in Padua. As a student at the Slade School of Art, Spencer had been much influenced by the \"primitive Italians\". At Burghclere his pictures are mostly of traumatised soldiers coping with war or in the uncertain process of rehabilitation. \"By this means I recover my lost self,\" he said. A self lost in the war. These are paintings of redemption, all the better for being tucked away in a cosy corner of southern England. </p> <p>After the postwar works come the nudes, including some fine pencil drawings made in 1931 of Spencer's first wife, Hilda. Then the naked, meaty stuff and the cycle of paintings of Christ in the streets of Spencer's home town of Cookham.

      "bodyText": "In 1974, when Stanley Spencer's reputation was pretty much at its nadir, the Tate bought the painter's curious \"leg of mutton\" portrait, a study in oils of a bespectacled yet otherwise naked Spencer hunkered down beside his wife, Patricia, spread-eagled on an old stripy bed in a rather uncomfortable post-coital moment. A joint of meat looks horribly raw in the foreground. The Tate still owns the work (Double Nude Portrait: the Artist and His Second Wife, 1937) and it's in Tate Britain's latest show. This gutsy reappraisal of this long-mocked English painter - set in a near-monastic setting designed by architect Claudio Silvestrin - attempts to elevate Spencer to the status of a Balthus, a Dix, or a Hopper. Maybe curators Patrick Wright and Timothy Hyman are right. Yet the \"leg of mutton\" portrait and the worst of Spencer's Cookham landscapes suggest he hovers awkwardly between the world of prewar London Transport posters, English whimsy, folksy religious sentiment and an embarrassingly immature attitude towards sex. The Tate show divides Spencer's work into key periods: before the first world war; the aftermath of the war; the 1930s, when he became rather neurotically besotted with sex; his social-realist work as war artist from 1940; and his last, haunting paintings, concerning his first wife's early death and his own impending demise from cancer. The early works are a cartoonish blend of Giotto and Samuel Palmer. His Last Supper is convincing: here the apostles' legs stretch under white togas as if to a fixed point under the table; with Christ at their head, they are as one, physically and spiritually. The postwar works come from the Oratory of All Souls at Burghclere, Hampshire. This gauntly awkward meeting of red-brick memorial chapel and almshouses, designed by Lionel Pearson and built between 1923 and 1927, was designed to house Spencer's canvases: his cycle of post-first world war oils depicting the psychological stresses endured by common soldiers. There is something wonderful about stepping into a Home Counties chapel and coming across England's own cut-price version of Giotto's Arena Chapel in Padua. As a student at the Slade School of Art, Spencer had been much influenced by the \"primitive Italians\". At Burghclere his pictures are mostly of traumatised soldiers coping with war or in the uncertain process of rehabilitation. \"By this means I recover my lost self,\" he said. A self lost in the war. These are paintings of redemption, all the better for being tucked away in a cosy corner of southern England. After the postwar works come the nudes, including some fine pencil drawings made in 1931 of Spencer's first wife, Hilda. Then the naked, meaty stuff and the cycle of paintings of Christ in the streets of Spencer's home town of Cookham. By this time, Spencer felt we could all be redeemed by a kind of collective hippie love-in. So he painted a veritable orgy set in a \"village in Heaven\" around the Cookham War Memorial. \"I am on the side of angels and dirt,\" he said. Spencer avoids the sexual obsessiveness of his contemporary Eric Gill, but you can't help wanting him to put it away, as it were (especially when you see the Lavatory 1 and Lavatory 2 pencil drawings of the early 1940s, which make an uncomfortably literal link between sexual curiosity and bowel movements). He should stick to what he does best, exploring the possibility of spirituality in a world in which cannons appear to have driven Christ far from England's green and pleasant land.

My responsibilities include upholding all UK legislation regarding merchant shipping and domestic vessels as well as surveying. I issue certificates for UK vessels and examine UK seafarers to make sure they are competent. I have the power of inspection, including foreign vessels - making sure they comply with international regulations. I also investigate complaints about breaches of regulations by any vessel in a port within my jurisdiction. I am very satisfied with my job and feel particularly valued. I provide an important public service. In just one day I'll offer quite a lot of advice for the industry about all sorts of matters, from information for small craft to a company wanting to know the regulations for passenger carriage in the area. This Harwich Marine Office is located with the coastguard so we also give information about high tides and sea conditions. In the private sector I would be paid up to \u00a325,000 more working for a classification society. It is a lot more money, but the hours are longer and you are under more pressure.

The important thing is that patients can see the nurses all the time. In the private sector people can feel quite isolated. I've just been on the RCN clinical leadership course. I've learned a lot that will help me put into practice lots of new ideas which will definitely improve patient care. Working in the public sector, we are valued. These days we are given much more autonomy and we work closely with senior management. We are told when we are doing well. Perhaps we'd like that more often, but then perhaps we don't thank people ourselves as much as we should.",

      "bodyText": "The \"excellence\" test councils must pass if they are to access a \u00a3160m government fund to refurbish housing stock is so tough that many local authorities may not bother trying, housing professionals have warned. Councils have campaigned for years to be allowed to escape the constraints of public borrowing rules. This would allow them to avoid transferring their homes to housing associations, which can borrow from the private markets. Last year in a sop to councils the government said some local authorities would be allowed to borrow from the fund if they achieve excellent or three-star best value ratings from the housing inspectorate. But of the 20 housing inspections so far carried out, no council has been awarded three stars. The chief housing inspector Roy Irwin today set out proposals for the criteria for achieving excellence at the Chartered Institute of Housing in Wales conference. The guidance explains that council housing services not only have to be excellent but need to show signs they will improve. Speaking to SocietyGuardian.co.uk, Mr Irwin defended the criteria: \"If it was easy it would have no value. It is tough but I don't think it is any way impossible.\" But the Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) warns there is a danger that money will go unspent because of the tough standards expected by the inspectors. CIH director of policy John Perry pointed out that Harrogate and Carrick councils, which are well known in the sector for good housing services, have only achieved two-star ratings from the inspectorate. \"The danger is that people will look at Harrogate and Carrick and think if they can't achieve three stars neither can we.\" He claimed that the promise of relaxed borrowing would be meaningless if no councils could achieve excellence. The government has set aside \u00a3160m for 2002-03 in borrowing approvals as an incentive for councils to achieve excellence. The cash is regarded by many as the first step towards municipal housing achieving its holy grail of borrowing funds from the money markets. Mr Irwin said he was confident that within the first 100 inspections at least \"some\" would achieve three-star ratings. It is understood that the Mr Irwin has come under pressure from housing minister Nick Raynsford not to apply the guidance too strictly. After successfully negotiating an agreement in principle from the Treasury for relaxed borrowing for some councils, Mr Raynsford is keen to see the policy implemented in practice.",

      "body": "<p>The second round of French local elections at the weekend produced headline victories for the left in Paris and Lyon, but equally striking - because unpredicted - success for the right elsewhere, as well as an interesting green turn in a number of towns. If the American presidential contest was not evidence enough, the French results show incumbents do not automatically get the benefit of the good times. France is in a fine state. Growth and job creation are up and unemployment has been falling. But for how much longer will prosperity last as the weather turns dark in the west and the far east?</p> <p>To date Europe looks relatively well insulated. Most trade is \"internal\". Equity markets likely to be hit less hard by the collapse of the dot.coms than Wall Street. The momentum of the past few years has not yet petered out, though there are disturbing signs in Germany, which is more exposed to decline in American markets. The weakness of the euro is only an advantage if the Americans and Japanese are buying; that, however, does not look likely for a while. But policy-makers could brace economic confidence.</p> <p>Survey shows the advent of the euro-in-your-purse next year is engendering optimism, at least in France. Preparing for the event might be a bigger engine of prosperity if the European central bank were not so constipated in its approach to interest rates. Or if the European Union could, collectively, engage with the agenda of market reform.

      "bodyText": "The second round of French local elections at the weekend produced headline victories for the left in Paris and Lyon, but equally striking - because unpredicted - success for the right elsewhere, as well as an interesting green turn in a number of towns. If the American presidential contest was not evidence enough, the French results show incumbents do not automatically get the benefit of the good times. France is in a fine state. Growth and job creation are up and unemployment has been falling. But for how much longer will prosperity last as the weather turns dark in the west and the far east? To date Europe looks relatively well insulated. Most trade is \"internal\". Equity markets likely to be hit less hard by the collapse of the dot.coms than Wall Street. The momentum of the past few years has not yet petered out, though there are disturbing signs in Germany, which is more exposed to decline in American markets. The weakness of the euro is only an advantage if the Americans and Japanese are buying; that, however, does not look likely for a while. But policy-makers could brace economic confidence. Survey shows the advent of the euro-in-your-purse next year is engendering optimism, at least in France. Preparing for the event might be a bigger engine of prosperity if the European central bank were not so constipated in its approach to interest rates. Or if the European Union could, collectively, engage with the agenda of market reform. As the former CBI boss, Adair Turner, pointed out yesterday, nobody with any sense now backs American-style liberalism against \"Rhenish\" welfare in the productivity or long-haul growth stakes.

In Germany, however, the lesson may prove a harsher one than elsewhere. </p> <p>Germans are relatively recent recruits to the concept of wider share ownership. Bonds have traditionally been the investment vehicle of choice. It was the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom in November 1996, attracting 1.5m small investors, which prompted the change. It was a success that was to be underpinned by the spectacular success of the Neuer Markt - the Frankfurt stock exchange's answer to Nasdaq. From its launch in March 1997 Neuer Markt provided the perfect platform for companies seeking capital and investors eager to cash in on the fashion. </p> <p>The rise of share ownership came at a crucial time in the development of corporate Germany. The old ways of Rhineland capitalism with its cosy links between businesses and banks, which were often shareholders too, was coming under pressure. International investors were demanding change. Corporate heavyweights, anxious to tap international markets and raise their profiles in key markets were prepared to go along. Stuttgard-based Daimler bought Detroit's Chrysler. German companies like BASF and, more recently, Siemens headed for Wall Street. </p> <p>Shareholder value had become the watchword along the Rhine. The snag is that shareholder value did not sit entirely comfortably alongside the traditional German social market economic model. For many, their company was a source of employment, rather than of dividends. </p> <p>The social nature or stakeholder model of German capitalism is deeply ingrained. Big companies were - and still are - at the heart of the communities where they are based. Take BASF and Bayer, two huge chemical combines. Ludwigshafen and Leverkusen, their respective bases, are dominated by their giant plants; for many in Ludwigshafen BASF is landlord as well as employer. It provides heating and waste water services to the surrounding community. Bayer even owns the football team, which plays in the German equivalent of England's premier league. </p> <p>This corporatism looked doomed last year when Vodafone pushed through what was, in effect, Germany's first, successful, hostile takeover bid - for Mannesmann. The mould appeared broken, and analysts expected to follow the trail blazed by Vodafone's pinstriped chief executive Chris Gent. </p> <p>The German government was prepared to be helpful. Finance minister Hans Eichel introduced reforms to sweep away the punitive taxation on capital gains realised when companies sold shares in other companies. Given that banks and insurers had often been sitting on stakes built up years before and carrying huge potential tax burdens, the move was seen - and indeed was presented in Berlin - as a way of opening the doors to widespread corporate restructuring. </p> <p>As old-economy Germany was bracing itself for change the new economy was taking off, too. Companies queued up to join the Neuer Markt - more than 300 all told. Investors piled into the shares. On March 10 last year the Neuer Markt topped 8,500. But like its American cousin, Nasdaq, the Neuer Markt's bubble was about to be punctured. </p> <p>Investors were waking up to the staggering values being put on companies that had yet to make money. They began to sell. The malaise spread. In Germany the Neuer Markt, with its once heady mix of fast growing hi-tech stocks, took the brunt. It now stands at less than a quarter of its all-time high. Amid the general free-fall, some stocks fell faster than others, sending regulators reaching for the rulebooks and angry investors phoning their lawyers. But while share prices were tumbling rapidly, the pace of corporate change has appeared glacial. Cynics might be forgiven for wondering whether Germany has paid anything more than lip service to the concept of shareholder value. </p> <p>Restructuring turned out to be little more than a couple of failed bank mergers and rumours of deals which never saw the light of day. Construction group Philipp Holzmann could be seen as more representative of the real face of corporate Germany than the outcome of the Vodafone/Mannesmann bid battle. </p> <p>Just as Vodafone was besieging Mannesmann, Holzmann rocked Germany by revealing a black hole in the accounts which threatened it with bankruptcy. Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der stood firmly behind a rescue operation, persuading creditor banks to back a deal by promising state aid. Last week Holzmann warned that it had not, as expected, broken even last year but had recorded a net loss of \u20ac50m. </p> <p>As for shareholder value, critics have been quick to point out that Daimler Crysler now has a market capitalisation roughly that of Daimler alone before the merger. Few US executives would expect to survive such a turn of events. J\u00fcrgen Schrempp, the architect of the deal remains at the helm of DaimlerChrysler, at least for the time being. As long as he keeps the backing of long time shareholder Deutsche Bank - which has around 15% of DaimlerChrysler shares - Mr Schrempp looks secure. </p> <p>Ron Sommer, the head of Deutsche Telekom, has also been under pressure after the company's share price crash. An ongoing row about whether the company knew its property portfolio was overvalued in the balance sheet as far back as 1995 has not helped. </p> <p>But the German government is the telecom group's biggest shareholder, and Berlin is still backing Mr Sommer. </p> <p>So has the reformist optimism which flowered last spring withered? Not according to Alison Cottrell, at UBS Warburg. The combination of investors wanting to buy shares, companies wanting to raise cash and banks willing to sell long-held stakes means, according to Ms Cottrell, that there is a momemtum behind the process of change. </p> <p>For example, take last week's results from Comdirect, a subsidiary of Commerzbank and one of Europe's largest discount stockbrokers. </p> <p>The contrast between the first and last quarters of last year is marked. The number of orders per account in the first three months was just over 60 - double the average for the previous year. The figure for the final quarter was less than 25. Activity in the first quarter of this year has been similarly modest, according to Comdirect executives. In other words, investors piled into the market in the run-up to the peak and have kept faith with stocks despite the slump. </p> <p>Max Dietrich Kley, the deputy chairman of BASF and president of the German institute for share promotion, points out that the benefits of the Eichel reforms have not yet come through because the reforms themselves have yet to come into effect. He argues that change is taking place, with companies aware that they have to compete internationally and that they have to match international standards. \"I think everyone understands that we have to create value, not destroy it.\" </p> <p>Nor does he believe that the roots of the nascent shareholding democracy are quite as shallow as they might appear. \"When you compare the situation in the US, we don't see much difference.'</p>",

      "body": "<p>As dusk settles over Moscow, the Road Patrol team is beginning to get anxious about its failure to find any corpses. The entire day has been spent driving through the city from traffic accident to police station to domestic crisis, and the only success so far has been to catch two crumpled Ladas smashed together in a snowdrift. A slightly injured passenger has already been taken to hospital; instead the cameraman is forced to film a patch of blood-stained snow, before stamping off, muttering: \"We're wasting our time. This is rubbish.\"</p> <p>So a wave of happy relief sweeps over the team when they receive the final call of the day. A retired engineer has spent the evening lying in bed drinking vodka and smoking, setting himself and his home alight; a raging fire is consuming a central Moscow apartment block.</p> <p>The team arrives just in time to film the man's burning belongings as they are hurled from a fifth-floor window that is still gushing thick smoke; blackened pages from photograph albums float through the night. Jumping over a tangle of hosepipes, the camera crew runs past the firemen and up the sealed-off stairway to where the dead engineer's widow and daughter are standing speechless over his body.</p> <p>This moment is recorded for the programme, and supplemented with shots from inside the smouldering flat, lingering on a vast collection of empty vodka bottles. \"He looked as though he died in his sleep,\" the cameraman says. \"But we filmed his feet, which had burnt a little.\"</p> <p>Outside, a group of children, no older than seven, crowd around - impressed by the team's trademark turquoise jackets. \"Wow. Road Patrol,\" they say.</p> <p>Broadcast four times a day, seven days a week, Road Patrol is one of Russia's most popular programmes - attracting viewers with its voyeuristic intrusion into the disasters that strike the capital every day. In 15-minute snatches, an assortment of murders, crash deaths and apartment infernos are flashed across the screen. Newly arrested suspects are led out from their police cells and goaded towards on-screen confessions - with a casual approach to the presumption of innocence before guilt is proven. The hysterical grief of victims is recorded. Dead bodies are shown in close-up on primetime television. This is not a show for the squeamish, but its success is immense.</p> <p>The format was created in the mid-1990s by a group of shrewd television executives who had latched on to the public's growing enthusiasm for televised crime and disaster - subjects glossed over for decades by relentlessly positive Soviet news broadcasts, which were dedicated primarily to the country's agricultural and industrial successes. The show regularly tops its channel's weekly ratings and advertisers compete to have names painted beneath the red lightning arrows on the side of its reporters' cars.</p> <p>The show's editor, Andrei Chereshnev, is a little defensive about its success, aware that the content is rather strong for western tastes. He insists that this is not entertainment because there is a strong moral message to the show; he claims it is designed to help people - like a horrifyingly graphic public safety warning. \"The main purpose is to inform people about the dangers of drinking and driving or of drug abuse. This kind of approach is far more effective than handing out government information leaflets,\" he says, reclining in a black leather chair. \"There is probably a small percentage of people who watch it just for the nasty pictures, but they're a minority because we're quite careful about what we show. We'd only do a close-up on a headless corpse if police wanted help in identifying it.\"</p> <p>The reporting teams have managed to persuade themselves that the show makes people feel happy. \"We cheer people up. They look at all the terrible things that are happening elsewhere in the city and cross themselves, saying, 'Thank God it wasn't me.' It helps people realise that their own lives are not so bad.\"</p> <p>At the end the of evening dispatch, figures for the day's murders, car crashes, drunk drivers and violent attacks are listed. When the programme first appeared, viewers complained that this information heightened people's fear of crime to such an extent that they were afraid to go out. Six years later, the show rarely triggers outrage; mainstream news broadcasts have begun to include equally graphic footage of dead disaster victims. \"People aren't shocked by our programme - it takes a lot to shock people here, but we realise it could never be shown in Europe or America because tastes are very different,\" Chereshnev says. Dozens of viewers telephone every day to tip off the programme about the location of developing catastrophes. Moscow police also ring in, happy to be filmed for the show.</p> <p>No one likes to admit that Road Patrol may simply be satisfying the public's appetite for violent disaster. But in a quiet moment, the cameraman points out that the reporting teams are under immense pressure to provide an ample supply of bleeding flesh. \"Sometimes people ring up complaining that there hasn't been enough blood. Ratings drop,\" he said. There is a lucrative market for bootleg greatest-hits videos that bring together the worst moments ever filmed.</p> <p>The reporters charged with scouring the city for disaster have developed a refined brand of morgue humour to help them cope with their work. They have sinister euphemisms for the mutilated corpses they come across. A murder victim whose arms and legs have been chopped off is called a \"samovar\" (a reference to the torso-shaped Russian kettle); those who have simply been chopped up are referred to as \"Lego\"; people who have thrown themselves from the roofs of buildings are \"parachutists\"; those who have drowned themselves are \"divers\"; the travelling morgue van, with its cold-storage facilities, is called \"Baskin Robbins\" (after the US ice-cream company). To the uninitiated, conversation with the team is extremely bemusing.</p> <p>Beneath the bleak humour, they claim to work to a strict ethical code. \"We may be cynical but we have our limits. We don't like filming dead children. Yesterday we found a baby that someone had thrown into a rubbish bin in the street. We didn't film that,\" the presenter says. Instead the team made up their quota of material when they came across two teenage heroin addicts hanging from the ceiling of an apartment block stairway. \"They'd run out of money for drugs so they killed themselves,\" the reporter says. Later there was an elderly woman who had slipped on the ice and fallen under a tram, so they were able to use that too, filming her greying body lying by the road, covered in a thin layer of snow. In a sombre voiceover, the presenter reported that the tram line was out of action for half an hour after the incident.</p> <p>Aside from the unsatisfactory road accidents, today's most successful report is the interview with a young boy accused of stealing a leather jacket from a man in an apartment-block lift. Police remove him from the police station cage to be interviewed.

      "bodyText": "As dusk settles over Moscow, the Road Patrol team is beginning to get anxious about its failure to find any corpses. The entire day has been spent driving through the city from traffic accident to police station to domestic crisis, and the only success so far has been to catch two crumpled Ladas smashed together in a snowdrift. A slightly injured passenger has already been taken to hospital; instead the cameraman is forced to film a patch of blood-stained snow, before stamping off, muttering: \"We're wasting our time. This is rubbish.\" So a wave of happy relief sweeps over the team when they receive the final call of the day. A retired engineer has spent the evening lying in bed drinking vodka and smoking, setting himself and his home alight; a raging fire is consuming a central Moscow apartment block. The team arrives just in time to film the man's burning belongings as they are hurled from a fifth-floor window that is still gushing thick smoke; blackened pages from photograph albums float through the night. Jumping over a tangle of hosepipes, the camera crew runs past the firemen and up the sealed-off stairway to where the dead engineer's widow and daughter are standing speechless over his body. This moment is recorded for the programme, and supplemented with shots from inside the smouldering flat, lingering on a vast collection of empty vodka bottles. \"He looked as though he died in his sleep,\" the cameraman says. \"But we filmed his feet, which had burnt a little.\" Outside, a group of children, no older than seven, crowd around - impressed by the team's trademark turquoise jackets. \"Wow. Road Patrol,\" they say. Broadcast four times a day, seven days a week, Road Patrol is one of Russia's most popular programmes - attracting viewers with its voyeuristic intrusion into the disasters that strike the capital every day. In 15-minute snatches, an assortment of murders, crash deaths and apartment infernos are flashed across the screen. Newly arrested suspects are led out from their police cells and goaded towards on-screen confessions - with a casual approach to the presumption of innocence before guilt is proven. The hysterical grief of victims is recorded. Dead bodies are shown in close-up on primetime television. This is not a show for the squeamish, but its success is immense. The format was created in the mid-1990s by a group of shrewd television executives who had latched on to the public's growing enthusiasm for televised crime and disaster - subjects glossed over for decades by relentlessly positive Soviet news broadcasts, which were dedicated primarily to the country's agricultural and industrial successes. The show regularly tops its channel's weekly ratings and advertisers compete to have names painted beneath the red lightning arrows on the side of its reporters' cars. The show's editor, Andrei Chereshnev, is a little defensive about its success, aware that the content is rather strong for western tastes. He insists that this is not entertainment because there is a strong moral message to the show; he claims it is designed to help people - like a horrifyingly graphic public safety warning. \"The main purpose is to inform people about the dangers of drinking and driving or of drug abuse. This kind of approach is far more effective than handing out government information leaflets,\" he says, reclining in a black leather chair. \"There is probably a small percentage of people who watch it just for the nasty pictures, but they're a minority because we're quite careful about what we show. We'd only do a close-up on a headless corpse if police wanted help in identifying it.\" The reporting teams have managed to persuade themselves that the show makes people feel happy. \"We cheer people up. They look at all the terrible things that are happening elsewhere in the city and cross themselves, saying, 'Thank God it wasn't me.' It helps people realise that their own lives are not so bad.\" At the end the of evening dispatch, figures for the day's murders, car crashes, drunk drivers and violent attacks are listed. When the programme first appeared, viewers complained that this information heightened people's fear of crime to such an extent that they were afraid to go out. Six years later, the show rarely triggers outrage; mainstream news broadcasts have begun to include equally graphic footage of dead disaster victims. \"People aren't shocked by our programme - it takes a lot to shock people here, but we realise it could never be shown in Europe or America because tastes are very different,\" Chereshnev says. Dozens of viewers telephone every day to tip off the programme about the location of developing catastrophes. Moscow police also ring in, happy to be filmed for the show. No one likes to admit that Road Patrol may simply be satisfying the public's appetite for violent disaster. But in a quiet moment, the cameraman points out that the reporting teams are under immense pressure to provide an ample supply of bleeding flesh. \"Sometimes people ring up complaining that there hasn't been enough blood. Ratings drop,\" he said. There is a lucrative market for bootleg greatest-hits videos that bring together the worst moments ever filmed. The reporters charged with scouring the city for disaster have developed a refined brand of morgue humour to help them cope with their work. They have sinister euphemisms for the mutilated corpses they come across. A murder victim whose arms and legs have been chopped off is called a \"samovar\" (a reference to the torso-shaped Russian kettle); those who have simply been chopped up are referred to as \"Lego\"; people who have thrown themselves from the roofs of buildings are \"parachutists\"; those who have drowned themselves are \"divers\"; the travelling morgue van, with its cold-storage facilities, is called \"Baskin Robbins\" (after the US ice-cream company). To the uninitiated, conversation with the team is extremely bemusing. Beneath the bleak humour, they claim to work to a strict ethical code. \"We may be cynical but we have our limits. We don't like filming dead children. Yesterday we found a baby that someone had thrown into a rubbish bin in the street. We didn't film that,\" the presenter says. Instead the team made up their quota of material when they came across two teenage heroin addicts hanging from the ceiling of an apartment block stairway. \"They'd run out of money for drugs so they killed themselves,\" the reporter says. Later there was an elderly woman who had slipped on the ice and fallen under a tram, so they were able to use that too, filming her greying body lying by the road, covered in a thin layer of snow. In a sombre voiceover, the presenter reported that the tram line was out of action for half an hour after the incident. Aside from the unsatisfactory road accidents, today's most successful report is the interview with a young boy accused of stealing a leather jacket from a man in an apartment-block lift. Police remove him from the police station cage to be interviewed. After a few minutes of aggressive questioning, the reporter asks him if his mother knows he is in jail, and the boy turns his face to the wall and begins to weep. The cameraman (who would rather be filming wildlife documentaries) lingers on the boy's shuddering back before spending several minutes trying to film sunshine through the police station's barred window. Satisfied, the reporter confides later: \"It looks good when they cry.\" A few hours later the boy's humiliation is broadcast to millions. This is a wearying job. \"I've stopped having nightmares, but I can never bring myself to watch the programme,\" the cameraman says. \"I still can't cope with the sight of bits of brain on the pavement, or dismembered hands or feet. I hate the sound of people crying in pain, begging for help. But it's my job to film it; my brain has learned to wash away the memories.\"",

Its poster and radio campaign follows trials in Manchester last year and is expected to include hospital and GP waiting rooms as well as pubs, bars, clubs and public transport. The group will also ask fashion shops to put stickers on changing cubicle mirrors with the message \"You're drop dead gorgeous - so don't drop dead drunk.\"</p> <p>Jean Coussens, director of the group, said: \"This is a tough message to get across. Occasional excesses are part of a normal learning curve. This campaign is the start of a long haul to change the image of drunkenness and the culture of excess around alcohol.\"</p> <p>The group's members are Allied Domecq, Bacardi-Martini, Bulmers, Campbell Distillers Pernod-Ricard, Diageo, Interbrew UK, Scottish and Newcastle, and Seagram, but pub chains have also backed the campaign.</p> <p>Ms Coussens said that the industry opposed drunkenness as much as any one, but one campaign was not the answer: \"We would be absolutely mad if we thought this alone could change behaviour.\" Other partners, including the government, would have to find funds for a whole range of campaigns and for more expensive forms of advertising.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest drink manufacturers yesterday warned that attempts to reverse Britain's bingeing culture could take a generation, as they launched the first national advertising to cut drunkenness in young people. They also challenged the government to use television and cinemas to try to make drunkenness as unacceptable as drink-driving, when they unveiled a \u00a31m campaign portraying excess as a sexual turn-off, a recipe for violence and a route to depression. The unprecedented attempt to change habits among the young follows concern that Britons are among the worst offenders in Europe. The Portman Group, funded by manufacturers to promote \"sensible drinking\", estimates that more than one in six aged 18-24, or 1m young adults, regularly drink simply to get drunk. Its poster and radio campaign follows trials in Manchester last year and is expected to include hospital and GP waiting rooms as well as pubs, bars, clubs and public transport. The group will also ask fashion shops to put stickers on changing cubicle mirrors with the message \"You're drop dead gorgeous - so don't drop dead drunk.\" Jean Coussens, director of the group, said: \"This is a tough message to get across. Occasional excesses are part of a normal learning curve. This campaign is the start of a long haul to change the image of drunkenness and the culture of excess around alcohol.\" The group's members are Allied Domecq, Bacardi-Martini, Bulmers, Campbell Distillers Pernod-Ricard, Diageo, Interbrew UK, Scottish and Newcastle, and Seagram, but pub chains have also backed the campaign. Ms Coussens said that the industry opposed drunkenness as much as any one, but one campaign was not the answer: \"We would be absolutely mad if we thought this alone could change behaviour.\" Other partners, including the government, would have to find funds for a whole range of campaigns and for more expensive forms of advertising.",

      "body": "<p>I was at home with my family when my brother, Tim, phoned with terrible news. Our eldest brother Peter, who was an archdeacon in Zimbabwe, had been found brutally murdered in his church that afternoon - February 26. The church warden had phoned Tim with the news. I was shocked and horrified. I had not expected anything like this, despite the country's recent troubles.</p> <p>Once the shock had passed, all I could think was that I needed to know more: we had only bare details. I contacted the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Zimbabwe high commission in London, but neither had heard anything. I then phoned the Guardian foreign desk. They said nothing had appeared on the news wires about it, and put me in contact with their correspondent in Harare, who confirmed that Peter, who was 67, had been murdered in his church.</p> <p>It wasn't until Tim and I went to Zimbabwe for Peter's funeral two weeks ago that we were able to glean more details. Peter, who lived in Masvingo, 200km east of Bulawayo, had gone to his church at 5:30am as normal, to carry out early-morning offices. When he didn't turn up for an appointment that afternoon, the church wardens went to his house, and found that it had been broken into. So they searched the church, and finally, behind the door leading to the belfry, they found him. His body was already cold - he had been lying there all day. He had been bound hand and foot, and socks had been forced into his mouth. He had been beaten about the head and body, and his neck had been broken. He died of asphyxiation.</p> <p>The Masvingo police arrested one man and said they had launched a \"massive manhunt\" for another. The second man is a former caretaker at the church who was recently released after serving a jail sentence for theft from Peter. He is also alleged to have savagely beaten two elderly white women of Peter's mainly African congregation. However, the police have since stated they have been unable to arrest him because he \"is never at home when we call\".</p> <p>Peter had been in Zimbabwe since 1970. He had previously worked in Birmingham, but felt a calling to help people in greater need, so he went to what was then Rhodesia. After a few years, he became dean of a cathedral in Zimbabwe, and most of his parish was African rather than European. He had always cared about others, but working with people in need strengthened that tendency. On my first visit to him in 1987, people told me how he gave away his money and belongings to those in need. He gave away most of his stipend and stopped drawing it two and a half years ago, when he was 65, so it could be used for better causes within the parish. He lived on his meagre overseas pension from the UK. To say it was a frugal life would be an understatement.</p> <p>Peter and I did not talk on the telephone much, but he loved to write long letters. Although he was not involved politically, he used to write a lot about his feelings towards the Zimbabwean authorities, particularly how they abused their power. He felt that way about the Rhodesian regime, and thought President Mugabe was heading in the same direction.</p> <p>There is a culture of petty racism in Zimbabwe. If you ask for help from the police, and they hear that you are European, they will not help you. Peter experienced this a few years ago. He heard an intruder in his house and phoned the police. Hearing his accent, they gave him the line: \"We don't have any transport.\" \"But I live just 400 metres from the station,\" Peter said. \"Sorry sir, no transport,\" they said, and hung up. Luckily, the intruder ran off without causing any harm.</p> <p>Many people in Zimbabwe, African and European, are disgusted by such behaviour. Everyone Tim and I spoke to was friendly and helpful. Peter's congregation were devastated by his death and they all came up to us to express their condolences - even to apologise.</p> <p>After the intimidation during the elections last year, many people are afraid to speak up in public. But privately, almost everybody, black and white, wants to talk about what is going on. They wanted to know what Tim and I, as outsiders, thought of Zimbabwe, and would then be extremely vocal in their opinions, which were universally anti-Mugabe.</p> <p>We were in Zimbabwe when it was reported that Peter Tatchell had tried make a citizen's arrest of Mugabe in Brussels, and the headlines were very amusing, and telling. \"Mugabe Nearly Arrested\", said the independent Daily News; but the government-backed Herald, said: \"Gay Gangster Tatchell Thumps Mugabe\".</p> <p>A waiter saw us comparing these headlines in the hotel and came over to speak. \"What do you think of this country?\" he asked. \"Well, it depends who's asking,\" I replied. \"There are only three of us here,\" he said.

He described very eloquently how Mugabe was ruining the country, that no tourists were coming, that the tourist economy was crippled and that his livelihood was eroding away.</p> <p>The strange thing is, though, that a lot of the people we spoke to seem optimistic.

Cuccia's mausoleum in the grounds of a family holiday home in Meina, overlooking Lake Maggiore, was found broken open on Friday, and on Saturday the police confirmed that his coffin was missing. Yesterday the investigators said they were baffled but had three theories: the body was taken for extortion, by satanists, or for a motive they would not divulge. The police believe that extortion is the most likely reason - other famous bodies have been snatched for that purpose - but the Cuccia family deny having received a ransom demand. Yesterday an anonymous caller to the ANSA news agency claimed responsibility on behalf of a group called Revolutionary Unemployed. Fabrizio Argentieri, the prosecutor in charge, dismissed the claim as absurd. But he admitted that there were few solid clues, and added: \"We could be proved wrong in the future if we neglected any lead.\" Cuccia died last year aged 92. He was the founder of Mediobanca, Italy's first merchant bank, and for half a century the country's key financial deal-maker and guardian of the control-room of Italian family capitalism. Famously tight-lipped, he would have been horrified to think he might become the centre of a public scandal after death. One theory being considered is that the thieves were looking for secret documents concealed in the coffin. Cuccia's passion for secrecy gave rise to the notion that he was a leading figure in an elite mystical gnostic conspiracy, and that has provided yet another theory about the theft. On Sunday investigators questioned Mediobanca's chief executive officer, Vittorio Maranghi, for about three hours, hoping for something that might throw a light on the mystery. A close associate of Cuccia's, the Republican party leader Giorgio La Malfa, said he was deeply perplexed but suggested that it might be the work of an eccentric political group. \"The mystery seems thicker than ever,\" he said. The police have not ruled out the possible involvement of satanists, who could have stolen the cadaver for use in occult rites. Two years ago three people alleged to belong to an organisation known as the Children of Satan were arrested in the neighbouring village of Invorio as they tried to smuggle the body of a friend out of the cemetery. But this would not be the first time that an illustrious corpse has been seized for ransom. In 1978 the body of Charlie Chaplin was stolen from its grave near Lake Geneva. Those responsible were arrested two months later and the body recovered. The bodies of the industrialist Serafino Ferruzzi and Raffaele Bagni, the son of a leading Italian footballer, who died in a road accident at the age of three, were stolen too. In neither of those cases was the body recovered. Even the corpse of Benito Mussolini went missing from its grave in Milan for more than a decade, although in that instance the kidnappers were a group of the Duce's political admirers.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Nicolas Godin appears in the sombre, wood-panelled bar of Paris's Htel Lut\u00e8ce, a scarf suspended from his dark ginger mop down past his faded Levi's. One half of Air, France's best-selling music exports, he cuts an instantly forgettable figure, more man at bus stop than million-selling pop star. Then Jean-Benot Dunckel, the other half of Air, arrives in an overlong white leather biker jacket, tricky fringe falling across his elfin features. JB sits down with a twinkly smile, apologising for the sunshine and blue sky outside. </p> <p>There is some disquiet in the Air today. JB and Nicolas haven't done an interview for two years. Now, with their new album 10,000Hz Legend in the can, they are finding that encapsulating the essence of their music is as easy as bottling fog. Take the track How Does It Make You Feel, a lyrical declaration of love articulated in a husky computer voice so full of feeling, the only reasonable response is tears. \"C'est pas de la merde,\" JB concedes, almost grudgingly. \"It's not shit.\" </p> <p>Three years after Air's first album, Moon Safari, it's clear that the band's relationship with their capricious muse has matured: 10,000Hz Legend demonstrates the same deepening and broadening, not to mention the off-into-the-audio-cosmos adventuring, that makes Daft Punk's Discovery so diverting. Compared with 10,000Hz Legend, Moon Safari was just Air going through their Westlife phase. Heavier, darker, sillier and more haunting, the new album dips into oceans of blues, rockets off aboard celestial choirs, settles down into genteel guitar musings, shudders with rickety bassline generators and ex presses a hugeness of feeling in 56 varieties of robo-voice. </p> <p>The first single will be Radio Number One, a meditation on the power of FM rendered in the effusive hi-fi sheen of the Beatles' Revolution. It features the lyrics: \"If you need some fun/ Some new stereo gum/ Radio Number One/ Brand new ears at once/ Eject musical trash.\" Brilliantly, the voice of a radio DJ descends from nowhere two thirds of the way through, begins scatting around the melody, then proceeds to introduce the traffic report followed by the weather. </p> <p>What do you define as \"musical trash\"? </p> <p>\"A lot of music is horrible,\" Nicolas offers. \"By making this music, we eject musical trash and make brand new music. This is a manifesto against the international karaoke. The music you hear every day on the radio, the industrial phenomenon of music.\" </p> <p>And that's as certain as it gets, although the band do suggest that 10,000Hz Legend is like \"a tree\", or possibly the Millennium Dome's Body Zone. \"You go in . . . it's all craziness,\" Nicolas explains, windmilling his arms across his torso. It's also like \"a book\", adds JB, the more intense of the pair, \"with many well-built songs. We wanted the listener to understand that the album is extreme, with no limit in imagination. The concept is unconscious,\" he stipulates. \"I mean, it's in the words 10,000Hz Legend.\" </p> <p>What is the concept? </p> <p>JB: \"Aaah . . . we don't know yet.\" </p> <p>Nicolas: \"We are looking for it. In fact, there is no explanation for a lot of things. It's just, go in the studio and record . . . you don't stop.\" </p> <p>\"For 10,000Hz Legend we wanted to change the sound for two reasons,\" explains JB. \"One, if you don't change, you will die as artists. Two, we consider that the music is a sort of god, and a god who always knows what is your will and purpose. Music is an offering: if you always give the same thing, he won't protect you. We want to please the god. We can't lie.\" </p> <p>Thankfully, Air's music has never needed much explaining. If they never made another record, these 30-year-olds would probably be granted immortality alongside Burt Bacharach, Lennon and McCartney and Brian Wilson as musicians who articulated the sound of love, loneliness and longing. They had the ambition and talent to reach beyond the lazy strictures of trip-hop, loungecore or any other micro-genre they at first appeared to inhabit. </p> <p>In the mid-1990s, just before they formed Air (in 1995), Nicolas was an architecture student and JB a maths teacher. But they were committed to the idea of music like most people are committed to the idea of breathing. JB took lessons at the Paris Conservatoire, and practised rigorous piano \u00e9tudes every day. It was - and remains, apparently - \"a sexual need\" of his. </p> <p>The road to Moon Safari began five years ago. Initially, Air made the trip across the Channel under the guise of trip-hop producers. Their first release, on the Mo'Wax label, was Modular Mix, an instrumental dream built on woozy analogue washes that recalled the experimentalism of Jean-Jacques Perrey, Pierre Henry and Claude Denjean, dance music's in-vogue sound at the time. Then their Casanova 70 single, released by French label Source, aroused attention beyond the dancefloors with an arrestingly beautiful euphonium line. While fellow Parisians Daft Punk were busily redefining dance music, Air were fusing evocative cinematica, artisan songwriting and easy-listening instrumentation - but not kitsch. </p> <p>When Moon Safari arrived, it was voted a classic. The 1970s retro sophistication in which Air came packaged - Mike Mills's dreamlike video for Kelly Watch the Stars and the album cover's watercolour line drawings - was only the start of the let's-just-lounge aesthetic. Moon Safari opened a portal to somewhere sunnier, happier and less cynical: their own youth. With the faint homoeroticism of the gurgly Sexy Boy on one side, the taut, opiated All I Need on the other, Moon Safari was instant yet nebulously cinematic; unconstrained by the pop song format, but irresistibly poppy. </p> <p>And the name seemed so correct for the bluesy, full-of-wonder sweep they conjured from obsolete synths, rudely basic acoustic guitars and crackly old studio technology. While Daft Punk's terse filter disco stomped its way onto the dancefloor, Air floated up to the stars and somewhere beyond. </p> <p>After Moon Safari came Air's soundtrack to Sofia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides, its subtle melancholia a perfect match for the doomed youth of the film's subjects. It was \"a try, a chance to try things\", says Nicolas. \"For a film, you look at the images and it tells you what to do. For an album, you start from nothing.\" </p> <p>For 10,000Hz Legend, that nothing commenced early last year and lasted six months. When making the tracks, the band bypassed the standard procedure of making demos, the rough audio sketches recorded onto tape, later to be adjusted and fleshed out into full songs. They spent time in LA and found a new studio in Paris, away from their native Versailles. \"We just need a place to be,\" Nicolas insists. \"We can record anywhere, in any studio.\" There were five months of recording, and then a final month, they explain, just to spend a few more of the record company's francs. </p> <p>Much of the time was spent in company: the duo marshalled an assembly of players united by the conviction that they didn't want to make \"70s kitsch music\". Joining drummer Brian Retzel, Beck's bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen and guitarist Roger Manning, then, were the \"crazy people\" - Beck among them - instructed to dance, sing, hit things and generally make a fuss awaiting the arrival of The Music. </p> <p>\"We wanted to make a sort of big band on the album, like a crazy people being all together,\" Nicolas says. \"We wanted to increase the family of Air. And Air is more soul and spirit, a concept of music. It's not about the people who were on the album.\" </p> <p>All this was in preparation for a creative constipation that never actually occurred. Air share the conviction that music is lightning, and they are merely the conduit - which can be difficult when there are release schedules to meet. \"We don't know where it comes from,\" says JB. \"That's why it's very scary . . . \" </p> <p>\"We arrived in the studio to do some improvisation and this is what came out,\" Nicolas adds. \"We are just a box to receive the idea.\" </p> <p>And when the music spoke, they became electronic performers, spinning the vocoded voices on Moon Safari into a new cast of robo-dialects. For an album packed with songs, JB and Nicolas's voices are scarcely ever there to hear, instead buried in deep-pile harmonic arrangements percolated through modulating effects. </p> <p>What's wrong with their own voices? \"Nothing. It's just . . . pudeur [modesty],\" Nicolas shrugs. \"Since the start, we used electronic voice in an emotional way, not a cold way. This is the trademark of Air. When we started using vocoder four years ago, it was like angels' voices, not robots'. We use machines to play human voices. Because we prefer to go out dressed than naked.\" </p> <p>It's only as something other than themselves - respectable, well-educated chaps from a posh neighbourhood of Paris - that Air now feel able to operate. It works best that way, JB explains, because, \"when you play the keyboard, you feel the currents going into the keyboard and all the messages it sends through MIDI cables. It's coming into your mind and you are part of the machine and the studio and you feel good.\" </p> <p>Nicolas chips in: \"Now my favourite musical instrument is electricity.\" For a moment he appears to mean it. But this time around, you suspect Air are not taking their own seriousness very seriously. </p> <p>\"I think most bands in France don't take themselves too seriously. Music is just fun,\" grins Nicolas. \"You know, we have always been Monty Python fans . . . \" </p> <p>\u0095 This feature is taken from the April 2001 issue of The Face magazine, on sale now.</p>",

So \"suspect\" were her conclusions that the prosecution had to tell the jury that it could not rely on her evidence.</p> <p>The tribunal is being watched by at least one legal team representing a person convicted after a trial in which Dr Lannas gave evidence.</p> <p>Since 1990 Dr Lannas, who qualified as a doctor in 1974, has performed more than 7,300 autopsies, including almost 400 suspicious deaths.</p> <p>She has been involved in cases including that of Leah Betts, who died after taking an ecstasy tablet on her 18th birthday in 1995, and Joy Gardner, who died in 1993 after police tried to arrest her for deportation.</p> <p>However, the names of the deceased in the cases which are being considered by the Home Office's policy advisory board for forensic pathology disciplinary tribunal are not being revealed.</p> <p>The quality of Dr Lannas's work came under scrutiny during a routine audit in 1996.

      "bodyText": "An experienced forensic pathologist who has been involved in several high profile cases was yesterday accused of botching a string of postmortem examinations. A professional standards committee called for Paula Lannas to be removed from the register of approved forensic pathologists used by the police and coroners to look into suspicious deaths. Members of the disciplinary tribunal which will decide Dr Lannas's fate were told that in four cases which were examined, the way her evidence was presented to the police and the crown prosecution service \"significantly affected the subsequent course of events\". One case which caused particular concern was a postmortem examination carried out on a baby who it was believed had been murdered. So \"suspect\" were her conclusions that the prosecution had to tell the jury that it could not rely on her evidence. The tribunal is being watched by at least one legal team representing a person convicted after a trial in which Dr Lannas gave evidence. Since 1990 Dr Lannas, who qualified as a doctor in 1974, has performed more than 7,300 autopsies, including almost 400 suspicious deaths. She has been involved in cases including that of Leah Betts, who died after taking an ecstasy tablet on her 18th birthday in 1995, and Joy Gardner, who died in 1993 after police tried to arrest her for deportation. However, the names of the deceased in the cases which are being considered by the Home Office's policy advisory board for forensic pathology disciplinary tribunal are not being revealed. The quality of Dr Lannas's work came under scrutiny during a routine audit in 1996. The board's quality assurance and scientific standards committee began to investigate and learned that two Essex coroners, including Dr Malcolm Weir who oversaw the Leah Betts inquest, had stopped her performing autopsies in their areas. In three cases involving deaths in Essex, said Nicola Davies QC, for the standards committee, Dr Lannas failed to carry out a \"vital aspect of the autopsy\". In one, for example, she did not dissect the face though a police officer had told her that it was possible the deceased had been assaulted. A subsequent autopsy revealed a recent bruise. Turning to the autopsy on the baby, Ms Davies said it \"fell woefully short of the requisite standards\". Though Ms Davies did not give details of the case, it is known that during a trial at the Old Bailey, Home Office pathologist Iain West described the way the baby's neck was dissected as \"cack-handed\". A jury at the Old Bailey took only 30 minutes to clear the defendant, who was accused of murdering the 16-month-old child, his girlfriend's son. Ms Davies said Dr Lannas's pathology work \"consistently fell substantially short\" of the standards expected of advisory board members. There were \"substantive deficiencies\" in her technical approach and medical knowledge. The \"sheer number and nature of the professional deficiencies alleged\" led to the conclusion that Dr Lannas's accreditation should be terminated or suspended. Before the hearing a spokesperson for Dr Lannas said she maintained that throughout her career she had acted properly and professionally. She was \"confident\" that her work would stand up to rigorous inspection. Dr Lannas has worked in forensic medicine in the UK since 1980, having moved from Zimbabwe where she was a government pathologist. The hearing continues.",

How feminist? Have gender roles warped out of all recognition, or are the thousands of women who now box all freaks? Or perhaps, as many people in England believe, boxing itself is a freak sport which is dangerous and barbaric and should be banned.

I find sparring, or practice-fighting, with men easy. I have no doubt a man can take my hardest punch. Sparring with women, however, brings up a quasi-feminist quandary that's very uncomfortable. When I first sparred with a woman of equal standard and weight, it felt unnatural to fight her. I was stuck between my burgeoning boxer nature and the role I assume in the world, in which I strive to be kind and want everyone to feel good.</p> <p>The internal battle that ensued would always cancel out the real one. But eventually I got over it by simply not thinking - which is rudimentary sports psychology, I guess, but which has a parallel outside the ring. I think women do this too much: worry about what the other is feeling instead of standing up for what we want. We're supposed to dislike confrontation, but boxing taught me how nice, how clean, confrontation can be.</p> <p>Once I got over the frankly insulting impulse to let the other girl win, I found sparring incredibly bonding.

The Royal Society of Arts, which commissioned the piece in its programme to put a new contemporary work on the plinth every six months, said making a 14ft high mass of see-through resin that did not fall in on itself had \"severely tested\" plastics specialists throughout Europe and the US. \"This is cutting-edge stuff,\" a spokesman said. \"It is not at all as straightforward as it sounds. This is an example of art challenging and advancing technology.\" The RSA predicted before Christmas that despite the difficulties it would be in place by March, but yesterday it conceded that it would be summer before the sculpture, paid for out of a \u00a3500,000 lottery backed fund, was unveiled. A spokeswoman at Anthony d'Offay, Whiteread's gallery, said: \"The problem with the resin has been solved. We can absolutely assure you that it will be in place early in June; it is just a matter now of confirming the exact date.\" The delay is yet another twist in the pantomine of the Trafalgar Square plinths. Thanks to the London mayor, Ken Livingstone, who wants to see the back of the bronzes of generals Sir Charles Napier and Sir Henry Havelock, there could be two further empty spots before long. Mr Livingstone would like at least one of the Victorian war heroes to make way for a statue of Nelson Mandela, or \"at least one of someone that means something to the public\".",

The Gloucestershire course is only a mile outside the exclusion zone and its managing director Edward Gillespie said: \"It is very worrying. All it needs is a sheep to sneeze in the wrong direction and our meeting would be off.\" The three-day festival, whose start was postponed from March 13 to April 17 because sheep had been grazing on the course, has been diluted by the Irish banning their horses from racing in it, and it looks long odds-on that the National Hunt's prime showpiece will be scrapped. Prospects of the \"no entry\" signs going up at Cheltenham have been the main topic among trainers and they are now setting their sights on the Grand National meeting, which begins on April 5. The Aintree executive is confident that the three-day meeting, set in an urban area, will go ahead, and the Ditcheat trainer Paul Nicholls will run See More Business, ante-post favourite for the Cheltenham Gold Cup, in the Martell Cup on April 5. A suspected case of foot and mouth is being investigated five miles from Lingfield, and all point-to-point racing in Britain will be banned until January next year; point-to-point had already been suspended and yesterday the Jockey Club point-to-point liaison committee unanimously decided to call a halt to the season, which had been due to run until June 16. Though there have been calls for a complete ban on racing, with the Queen \"expressing concern\" about the sport continuing, the British Horse- racing Board is determined it will continue so long as courses are outside exclusion zones. The BHB has been accused of double standards in its policy on racecourses which could go ahead but have cancelled meetings during the crisis; those tracks have been told that they will forfeit all fixtures for the duration of the outbreak. Peter Savill, chairman of the BHB, said the racecourse planning committee needed to know which courses were willing to race so that a programme could be put in place. Meanwhile, Wales are considering moving their Six Nations rugby union match against Ireland on April 29 from Cardiff's Millennium stadium to Spain, with Barcelona the favourite to host the game postponed from this month.

      "body": "<p>Four months after many of them won seats in the most expensive election battle in American political history, US politicians yesterday faced the question of whether to bite the hands that feed them.</p> <p>Reformers have been promised two weeks of debate on the bill to change the country's controversial campaign finance laws put forward by senators John McCain, a Republican, and his Democratic counterpart, Russell Feingold.</p> <p>Although their reform package is generally considered to have its best chance of success in a decade of agitation, support for the bill is already beginning to evaporate.</p> <p>The Senate yesterday began debating the bill which would ban businesses, trade unions and individuals from making unlimited \"soft money\" contributions to US political parties rather than to candidates. The bill would also prevent organisations from running their own \"issue ads\" during the 60 days prior to election day.</p> <p>Recent figures revealed that the Republicans received $244m (\u00a3170m) worth of soft money donations in the 2000 election, while Democrats received $243m. Special interest groups spent hundreds of millions of dollars on issue advertising last year, effectively providing a huge pool of extra financing for candidates of the two main parties.</p> <p>\"After one of the closest elections in our nation's history, there's one thing the American people are unanimous about - they want their government back,\" Mr McCain said.</p> <p>\"We can do that by ridding politics of large, unregulated contributions that give special interests a seat at the table while average Americans are stuck in the back of the room.\"</p> <p>Mr McCain, who made campaign finance reform the central plank of his unsuccessful Republican presidential nomination bid last year, joined Mr Feingold for a demonstration outside Republican and Democratic party headquarters in Washington yesterday before the debate began.</p> <p>\"Unfortunately, the party of the people is now engaged in raising $100,000, $500,000 and $1 million contributions from corporations, unions and individuals,\" Mr Feingold said. \"This is not why I became a Democrat, and it is not the future of the Democratic party.\"</p> <p>Supporters of reform base their belief that they can force changes through the new congress on two main factors: first, the surge of support in both par ties for Mr McCain's campaign on the issue and, second, the fact that the current 50-50 split in the Senate puts the reformers close to having the 60 votes needed to block a filibuster against their bill.</p> <p>Mr McCain said a majority of the Senate appears to favour some limits on campaign fiance contributions, but he fears that opponents might kill the bill with amendments that \"are sort of like poison pills\".</p> <p>Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, an opponent of reform, said there would be \"fascinating\" procedural issues in the weeks to come. \"We're going to have two weeks of freewheeling debate,\" he added.</p> <p>Although there are 50 Democrats in the Senate, one of them, John Breaux of Louisiana, has already said he will vote against the McCain-Feingold bill on the grounds that reform of soft money will give Republicans - traditionally bigger accumulators of regulated \"hard money\" donations - a funding advantage.</p> <p>The reformers must also convince sceptics that the bill does not run foul of constitutional free speech guarantees. The provisions on issue advertising, in particular, could ultimately be the focus of a supreme court challenge about the bill's legality.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Four months after many of them won seats in the most expensive election battle in American political history, US politicians yesterday faced the question of whether to bite the hands that feed them. Reformers have been promised two weeks of debate on the bill to change the country's controversial campaign finance laws put forward by senators John McCain, a Republican, and his Democratic counterpart, Russell Feingold. Although their reform package is generally considered to have its best chance of success in a decade of agitation, support for the bill is already beginning to evaporate. The Senate yesterday began debating the bill which would ban businesses, trade unions and individuals from making unlimited \"soft money\" contributions to US political parties rather than to candidates. The bill would also prevent organisations from running their own \"issue ads\" during the 60 days prior to election day. Recent figures revealed that the Republicans received $244m (\u00a3170m) worth of soft money donations in the 2000 election, while Democrats received $243m. Special interest groups spent hundreds of millions of dollars on issue advertising last year, effectively providing a huge pool of extra financing for candidates of the two main parties. \"After one of the closest elections in our nation's history, there's one thing the American people are unanimous about - they want their government back,\" Mr McCain said. \"We can do that by ridding politics of large, unregulated contributions that give special interests a seat at the table while average Americans are stuck in the back of the room.\" Mr McCain, who made campaign finance reform the central plank of his unsuccessful Republican presidential nomination bid last year, joined Mr Feingold for a demonstration outside Republican and Democratic party headquarters in Washington yesterday before the debate began. \"Unfortunately, the party of the people is now engaged in raising $100,000, $500,000 and $1 million contributions from corporations, unions and individuals,\" Mr Feingold said. \"This is not why I became a Democrat, and it is not the future of the Democratic party.\" Supporters of reform base their belief that they can force changes through the new congress on two main factors: first, the surge of support in both par ties for Mr McCain's campaign on the issue and, second, the fact that the current 50-50 split in the Senate puts the reformers close to having the 60 votes needed to block a filibuster against their bill. Mr McCain said a majority of the Senate appears to favour some limits on campaign fiance contributions, but he fears that opponents might kill the bill with amendments that \"are sort of like poison pills\". Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, an opponent of reform, said there would be \"fascinating\" procedural issues in the weeks to come. \"We're going to have two weeks of freewheeling debate,\" he added. Although there are 50 Democrats in the Senate, one of them, John Breaux of Louisiana, has already said he will vote against the McCain-Feingold bill on the grounds that reform of soft money will give Republicans - traditionally bigger accumulators of regulated \"hard money\" donations - a funding advantage. The reformers must also convince sceptics that the bill does not run foul of constitutional free speech guarantees. The provisions on issue advertising, in particular, could ultimately be the focus of a supreme court challenge about the bill's legality.",

      "body": "<p>John Phillips, the founder and principal songwriter of the 1960s vocal group, the Mamas and Papas, has died aged 65. He arranged their dynamic harmonies and wrote, or co-wrote, most of their best-known songs, including California Dreamin', Monday, Monday and Creeque Alley. He also wrote the hippie anthem San Francisco. In less than two years, the group had six American Top-10 hits and sold millions of records worldwide, before internal frictions brought about their downfall.</p> <p>The son of a marine officer, Phillips was born in South Carolina. He studied at George Washington University, and briefly attended the US Naval Academy before migrating to New York in 1957 to join the Greenwich Village folk scene. There, he formed several groups, including the New Journeymen, whose members included guitarist and singer Denny Doherty and Michelle Gilliam, who became his second wife in 1962. The quartet that was to become the Mamas and Papas was completed by the arrival of Cass Elliot, who had formerly sung with Doherty in the Mugwumps.</p> <p>The quartet moved to Los Angeles, where they linked up with record producer Lou Adler. He later said of their audition: \"They had just come down from about 80 acid trips; they were funky, dirty and grizzly, and yet they sang like angels.\" Elliot found them a name after hearing a Hell's Angel say, \"We call our women mamas,\" on a television show.</p> <p>Their first single was California Dreamin', released on Adler's Dunhill label in 1966. Doherty was the lead singer, Glen Campbell played guitar, and the flute solo was by jazz musician Bud Shank. Like another of John Phillips's 1966 compositions, San Francisco (Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair), it portrayed California as a new utopia, and was the first of a series of his powerful ballads. These included the playful Creeque Alley, which told the history of the group, the ecstatic love song, I Saw Her Again Last Night, and the sombre Look Through My Window.</p> <p>The Mamas and Papas also recorded some deftly-chosen songs from the 50s, notably Dedicated To The One I Love, originally by the Shirelles. Phillips's four-part vocal arrangements were influenced by the jazz singing of Lambert, Hendricks and Ross, and by such 1950s pop groups as the Four Freshmen. With Lou Adler, Phillips organised the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, which introduced Jimi Hendrix and The Who to American audiences.</p> <p>But the Phillips' marriage had been damaged by Michelle's affair with Doherty, for whom Elliot had an unrequited passion. Michelle was temporarily ejected from the group, and the end came when Elliott left to follow a successful solo career as Mama Cass. She died suddenly in 1974.</p> <p>In 1970, Phillips made his own solo album, The Wolf-king Of LA, which reflected the growing popularity in Los Angeles of the country-rock sound associated with his friend Gram Parsons. Its lyrics mostly concerned the lifestyle of the new Los Angeles movie and music aristocracy, of which Phillips was a leading member.</p> <p>By this time, however, he was in the grip of the drug addiction graphically described in his 1986 autobiography, Papa John. He had little incentive to work in the 1970s, as he was reportedly receiving $100,000 a year in composer royalties. The sum total of his musical activity in that decade was the soundtrack music for Nicolas Roeg's film The Man Who Fell To Earth (1976), and the production of an album by his third wife, Genevieve Waite. He also recorded some solo tracks, with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards as producers, which are due to be issued in May under the title Pay, Pack And Follow.</p> <p>The catalyst for Phillips to return to the stage was a conviction for drug offences that forced him to undergo rehabilitation in 1981. As part of his sentence, he gave lectures on drug abuse, assisted by his daughter, McKenzie.</p> <p>The following year, he was fit enough to form a new Mamas and Papas group, with Doherty, McKenzie and Elaine \"Spanky\" McFarlane (formerly of the Los Angeles group Sparky and Our Gang). Later members of the re-formed quartet included Scott McKenzie, an ex-Journeyman and the singer of the hit version of San Francisco. In 1998, Phillips was reunited with Doherty and Michelle when the Mamas and Papas were inducted into the rock 'n' roll hall of fame, and last year he made a new album that is expected to be issued later this year.</p> <p>Phillips died in a Los Angeles hospital of heart failure, following several years of failing health after a liver transplant and two hip replacements. He was married four times and leaves five children and two stepchildren. They include McKenzie, now a television actress, Chynna, a member of the Wilson Phillips vocal group, and Bijou, a singer and model.</p> <p>\u0095 John Edward Andrew Phillips, singer and songwriter, born August 30 1935; died March 18 2001</p>",

      "bodyText": "John Phillips, the founder and principal songwriter of the 1960s vocal group, the Mamas and Papas, has died aged 65. He arranged their dynamic harmonies and wrote, or co-wrote, most of their best-known songs, including California Dreamin', Monday, Monday and Creeque Alley. He also wrote the hippie anthem San Francisco. In less than two years, the group had six American Top-10 hits and sold millions of records worldwide, before internal frictions brought about their downfall. The son of a marine officer, Phillips was born in South Carolina. He studied at George Washington University, and briefly attended the US Naval Academy before migrating to New York in 1957 to join the Greenwich Village folk scene. There, he formed several groups, including the New Journeymen, whose members included guitarist and singer Denny Doherty and Michelle Gilliam, who became his second wife in 1962. The quartet that was to become the Mamas and Papas was completed by the arrival of Cass Elliot, who had formerly sung with Doherty in the Mugwumps. The quartet moved to Los Angeles, where they linked up with record producer Lou Adler. He later said of their audition: \"They had just come down from about 80 acid trips; they were funky, dirty and grizzly, and yet they sang like angels.\" Elliot found them a name after hearing a Hell's Angel say, \"We call our women mamas,\" on a television show. Their first single was California Dreamin', released on Adler's Dunhill label in 1966. Doherty was the lead singer, Glen Campbell played guitar, and the flute solo was by jazz musician Bud Shank. Like another of John Phillips's 1966 compositions, San Francisco (Be sure to wear some flowers in your hair), it portrayed California as a new utopia, and was the first of a series of his powerful ballads. These included the playful Creeque Alley, which told the history of the group, the ecstatic love song, I Saw Her Again Last Night, and the sombre Look Through My Window. The Mamas and Papas also recorded some deftly-chosen songs from the 50s, notably Dedicated To The One I Love, originally by the Shirelles. Phillips's four-part vocal arrangements were influenced by the jazz singing of Lambert, Hendricks and Ross, and by such 1950s pop groups as the Four Freshmen. With Lou Adler, Phillips organised the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival, which introduced Jimi Hendrix and The Who to American audiences. But the Phillips' marriage had been damaged by Michelle's affair with Doherty, for whom Elliot had an unrequited passion. Michelle was temporarily ejected from the group, and the end came when Elliott left to follow a successful solo career as Mama Cass. She died suddenly in 1974. In 1970, Phillips made his own solo album, The Wolf-king Of LA, which reflected the growing popularity in Los Angeles of the country-rock sound associated with his friend Gram Parsons. Its lyrics mostly concerned the lifestyle of the new Los Angeles movie and music aristocracy, of which Phillips was a leading member. By this time, however, he was in the grip of the drug addiction graphically described in his 1986 autobiography, Papa John. He had little incentive to work in the 1970s, as he was reportedly receiving $100,000 a year in composer royalties. The sum total of his musical activity in that decade was the soundtrack music for Nicolas Roeg's film The Man Who Fell To Earth (1976), and the production of an album by his third wife, Genevieve Waite. He also recorded some solo tracks, with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards as producers, which are due to be issued in May under the title Pay, Pack And Follow. The catalyst for Phillips to return to the stage was a conviction for drug offences that forced him to undergo rehabilitation in 1981. As part of his sentence, he gave lectures on drug abuse, assisted by his daughter, McKenzie. The following year, he was fit enough to form a new Mamas and Papas group, with Doherty, McKenzie and Elaine \"Spanky\" McFarlane (formerly of the Los Angeles group Sparky and Our Gang). Later members of the re-formed quartet included Scott McKenzie, an ex-Journeyman and the singer of the hit version of San Francisco. In 1998, Phillips was reunited with Doherty and Michelle when the Mamas and Papas were inducted into the rock 'n' roll hall of fame, and last year he made a new album that is expected to be issued later this year. Phillips died in a Los Angeles hospital of heart failure, following several years of failing health after a liver transplant and two hip replacements. He was married four times and leaves five children and two stepchildren. They include McKenzie, now a television actress, Chynna, a member of the Wilson Phillips vocal group, and Bijou, a singer and model. \u0095 John Edward Andrew Phillips, singer and songwriter, born August 30 1935; died March 18 2001",

Perhaps we can look forward to Father Christmas being authenticated at the same time?</p> <p>You mention \"ghost dilutions\" without making it clear those dilutions are so extreme that no chemical or physical testing procedure can determine the difference between homeopathic and non-homeopathic water. I differ with your statement that the John Maddox/Walter Stewart/Randi team who investigated for Nature and the US National Institutes of Health \"could find no fault with Benveniste's methods - only his results\". We controlled the experiments against the possibility of conscious or unconscious bias and/or manipulation, and the result was the only set of experiments in the history of that lab which produced null results. That speaks for itself. You describe the excellent protocol implemented by Professor Ennis, in line with the double-blind, independent techniques this foundation espouses. But the protocol described by Dr Benveniste in his original paper sounded foolproof and unassailable.</p> <p>My foundation has a standing $1m challenge to anyone to tell the difference between a homoeopathic preparation and a non-homoeopathic control.

      "bodyText": "As the unnamed \"magician\" referred to in your article on homeopathy (Thanks for the memory, Science, March 15), the results of Professor Madeleine Ennis in Belfast, interest me greatly. If they are eventually replicated, it could mean the definitive validation of the claims that have been made by homeopaths for over 200 years. Perhaps we can look forward to Father Christmas being authenticated at the same time? You mention \"ghost dilutions\" without making it clear those dilutions are so extreme that no chemical or physical testing procedure can determine the difference between homeopathic and non-homeopathic water. I differ with your statement that the John Maddox/Walter Stewart/Randi team who investigated for Nature and the US National Institutes of Health \"could find no fault with Benveniste's methods - only his results\". We controlled the experiments against the possibility of conscious or unconscious bias and/or manipulation, and the result was the only set of experiments in the history of that lab which produced null results. That speaks for itself. You describe the excellent protocol implemented by Professor Ennis, in line with the double-blind, independent techniques this foundation espouses. But the protocol described by Dr Benveniste in his original paper sounded foolproof and unassailable. My foundation has a standing $1m challenge to anyone to tell the difference between a homoeopathic preparation and a non-homoeopathic control. My colleagues on L'affaire Benveniste are as willing as I to be convinced by proper evidence. But until independent replication is accomplished, we will reserve judgement.

And while the conservative president, Jacques Chirac, will be lamenting the loss of the capital he ran as mayor for nearly 20 years, there were plenty of reasons for him to take heart from the right's robust showing in this weekend's nationwide municipal elections. \"We don't have to change our policies, but we clearly have to adapt our way of governing,\" admitted the Socialist party chairman, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, noting that the ruling leftwing coalition's strong national record on boosting economic growth and cutting unemployment had not sufficiently impressed local voters. The left lost around 30 important towns and cities in Sunday's second-round run-off, while half a dozen key ministers were humiliated in their bid to wrest provincial conservative strongholds from the right, or even to retain town halls they had run for years. Commentators warned that the \"blue wave\" that brought the Gaullist RPR party and its centrist allies, the UDF, to power in town halls around the country would lead to the defeat of Lionel Jospin's Socialist-led government if repeated in parliamentary elections next year. \"The blue wave that swept across France's regions weakens Jospin more than the gains in Paris and Lyon strengthen him,\" wrote the left-leaning Lib\u00e9ration, and the rightwing Le Figaro agreed: \"Despite its murderous divisions and culpable errors, the right is in a majority in the country. Based on yester day's results, parliamentary elections would see the 'plural left' back in opposition.\" The decline of Mr Jospin's coalition allies, the Communists - who in Nimes on Sunday lost the last town they ran with a population of more than 100,000 - combined with the strong performance by the Greens will create strains within the ruling plural left alliance and may force Mr Jospin into a cabinet reshuffle. Indeed, looking ahead to the parliamentary and presidential elections due in spring 2002, the right may find it easier to rally its troops than the left does to run its Socialist-Communist-Greens coalition. \"The right wing is alive and well, make no mistake about it,\" said Stephane Rozes of the polling organisation, CSA. Michele Alliot-Marie, the RPR chairwoman, said the right had a nationwide majority that extended even to Paris, where the left won a majority of seats on the city council despite polling fewer votes.

Senior rightwing politicians such as the former prime ministers Alain Jupp\u00e9 and Edouard Balladur have redoubled their efforts to unify France's conservative forces under a single banner before the polls in 2002. For Mr Chirac's bid to win re-election to the Elys\u00e9e palace, the loss of Paris was a heavy blow. But it may not yet prove a disaster, since even when helped by a catastrophic conservative campaign in the capital, the left still failed to poll an absolute majority of votes.",

A mountain of evidence suggests that luxury city apartments were given to friends and relatives for little or no rent, electoral rolls were stuffed with non-existent or even dead voters, some RPR activists received well-paid but wholly fictitious city jobs, and building companies were made to pay multimillion-franc commissions to win public contracts. The resulting scandal proved fatal to Mr Tiberi, who was kicked out of the RPR late last year but refused to be made a scapegoat and fought a renegade campaign for re-election as mayor. The new mayor's first move will be to order an independent audit of the city's \u00a33.3bn annual budget, an exercise that could send more embarrassing skeletons tumbling out of the RPR's cupboards. He also wants to create more green spaces in Europe's most densely-packed capital by taking over unused land from the army and the state railway company, SNCF; to discourage car use in large areas of central Paris, offer cheap bikes for rent at most metro stations and turn the polluted Grands Boulevards into a paradise for pedestrians, cyclists and rollerbladers.",

The idea of rats, crows and magpies feasting on diseased meat and spreading foot and mouth further is macabre, although any transmission of the disease by this means is extremely unlikely, according to veterinary experts. Yesterday the animals to be slaughtered passed the 300,000 mark, 50% more than at the same stage of the 1967 outbreak. The logistics of disposing of the carcasses are enormous, and involve many stages, including the undertaking of an independent valuation of each animal to be killed. The first stage is diagnosis of the disease or the making of a decision that animals must be killed because they are in dangerous contact with the disease. Farmers can chose the valuer they want to look at the stock in question. In the case of thousands of sheep on a mountainside, getting them all in one place to be valued individually, and then to be slaughtered, is a major exercise. In Cumbria, 89 outbreaks, and Dumfries and Galloway, 46 cases, valuation is taking time, especially when farmers request a valuer already busy elsewhere.

      "body": "<p>For a company that specialises in communications, <strong> Marconi</strong> has been of late surprisingly reluctant to talk. </p> <p>It last updated the City on trading in November and, despite a dramatic change in the fundamentals of the telecommunications equipment industry, has said nothing since. </p> <p>The latest blow to the sector came yesterday, when Corning, the world leader in fibre-optic cable, said its profits would fall short of Wall Street's forecasts. </p> <p>This came on top of warnings from Nokia, Alcatel, Ericsson and Siemens in recent weeks which have caused analysts to readjust their assumptions about the industry. </p> <p>In view of Marconi's radio silence it is hardly surprising that the investors have been giving the stock a wide berth. Last night the shares - 719p at the start of the year - stood at 364p, after falling 28p. </p> <p>Analysts find it almost inconceivable that Marconi has escaped unscathed from the downturn in telecoms spending - especially as most of its revenues come from the slowing US economy. </p> <p>Citing this factor, analysts at CSFB, one of Marconi's brokers, yesterday sharply reduced profits and sales forecasts. For 2001, CSFB is now looking for earnings before interest and tax of \u00a3792m, rather than the \u00a3885m previously, and for the following year, \u00a31.01bn against \u00a31.10bn before. </p> <p>Although CSFB has retained a \"buy\" rating on the stock - it says Marconi is cheap compared with its peers - others are not quite as confident. With the joint house broker cutting its estimates just before Marconi goes into its quiet period, ahead of full figures in May, traders sense bad news is on the way. </p> <p>In the wider market, dealers had to endure a lacklustre session notable only for strong gains in the mining sector after <strong> Billiton </strong> , up 24p to 544p, confirmed it was merging with Australian rival BHP. <strong> Rio Tinto </strong> , 20p stronger at \u00a312.05, and <strong> Lonmin </strong> , 49p better at 925.5p, both benefited from hopes of further consolidation. </p> <p>However, with most of the Square Mile content to sit on its hands until the US Federal Reserve concludes its latest rate-setting meeting today, the FTSE 100 index slipped 11.2 points to 5,551.6 - its lowest close since December 14 1998. Economists expect Fed chairman Alan Greenspan to lower rates by at least 50 basis-points. </p> <p>Most of the downside came from the telecoms sector - with <strong> Energis </strong> , 38.5p worse at 310.5p, and <strong> Colt Telecom </strong> , 70p weaker at 825p - both posting heavy losses on the back of the news from Corning. </p> <p>Technology stocks were also weak. The FTSE Techmark 100 index dipped 50.48 points to 2,018.45 with software accountancy group <strong> Sage</strong> - down 10p to 250p - failing to recover from Friday's mauling. </p> <p>Dealers attributed the fall to negative noises from Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. </p> <p>Following a meeting with the company, the broker revealed that it had reduced its target price and trimmed its estimates because of the deteriorating prospects on the other side of the Atlantic. </p> <p>But it was not just hi-tech issues that were feeling the chill from the US economic slowdown. Mail order specialist <strong> GUS</strong> shed 20p to 450p after UBS Warburg lowered its forecasts - citing concerns that Experian, its American credit rating agency, will lose market share in the downturn, just as it did in last year. </p> <p>On the second tier, positive feedback from recent presentations helped troubled engineer <strong> Tomkins</strong> rise 5.5p to 157p. </p> <p>Meanwhile, property group <strong> Great Portland Estates</strong> was 7p higher at 277.5p on news that Capital &amp; Counties, a subsidiary of rival <strong> Liberty </strong> - down 1p to 541.5p - has increased its holding to 7.56%. </p> <p>In the smaller company universe, tiny building services company <strong> Cape</strong> ended unchanged at 16p after <strong> YJL</strong> - which remained steady at 25.75p - declared that it had added to its 15% stake by buying 1m shares on Friday. </p> <p>Some traders believe that YJL is probably positioning itself to make an approach - despite the fact that Cape is facing legal claims from workers for asbestos poisoning.</p>",

Last night the shares - 719p at the start of the year - stood at 364p, after falling 28p. Analysts find it almost inconceivable that Marconi has escaped unscathed from the downturn in telecoms spending - especially as most of its revenues come from the slowing US economy. Citing this factor, analysts at CSFB, one of Marconi's brokers, yesterday sharply reduced profits and sales forecasts. For 2001, CSFB is now looking for earnings before interest and tax of \u00a3792m, rather than the \u00a3885m previously, and for the following year, \u00a31.01bn against \u00a31.10bn before. Although CSFB has retained a \"buy\" rating on the stock - it says Marconi is cheap compared with its peers - others are not quite as confident. With the joint house broker cutting its estimates just before Marconi goes into its quiet period, ahead of full figures in May, traders sense bad news is on the way. In the wider market, dealers had to endure a lacklustre session notable only for strong gains in the mining sector after Billiton , up 24p to 544p, confirmed it was merging with Australian rival BHP. Rio Tinto , 20p stronger at \u00a312.05, and Lonmin , 49p better at 925.5p, both benefited from hopes of further consolidation. However, with most of the Square Mile content to sit on its hands until the US Federal Reserve concludes its latest rate-setting meeting today, the FTSE 100 index slipped 11.2 points to 5,551.6 - its lowest close since December 14 1998. Economists expect Fed chairman Alan Greenspan to lower rates by at least 50 basis-points. Most of the downside came from the telecoms sector - with Energis , 38.5p worse at 310.5p, and Colt Telecom , 70p weaker at 825p - both posting heavy losses on the back of the news from Corning. Technology stocks were also weak. The FTSE Techmark 100 index dipped 50.48 points to 2,018.45 with software accountancy group Sage - down 10p to 250p - failing to recover from Friday's mauling. Dealers attributed the fall to negative noises from Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. Following a meeting with the company, the broker revealed that it had reduced its target price and trimmed its estimates because of the deteriorating prospects on the other side of the Atlantic. But it was not just hi-tech issues that were feeling the chill from the US economic slowdown. Mail order specialist GUS shed 20p to 450p after UBS Warburg lowered its forecasts - citing concerns that Experian, its American credit rating agency, will lose market share in the downturn, just as it did in last year. On the second tier, positive feedback from recent presentations helped troubled engineer Tomkins rise 5.5p to 157p. Meanwhile, property group Great Portland Estates was 7p higher at 277.5p on news that Capital &amp; Counties, a subsidiary of rival Liberty - down 1p to 541.5p - has increased its holding to 7.56%. In the smaller company universe, tiny building services company Cape ended unchanged at 16p after YJL - which remained steady at 25.75p - declared that it had added to its 15% stake by buying 1m shares on Friday. Some traders believe that YJL is probably positioning itself to make an approach - despite the fact that Cape is facing legal claims from workers for asbestos poisoning.",

Finally, the swell turns to outright bombast, and a gaggle of voices lets rip, clear, bold and passionate. And the voices sing this: \"KPMG/ We're strong as can be/A dream of power and energy/We go for the goal/Together we hold/On to our vision of global strategy...\" </p> <p>Welcome to musical hell. A place where men and women trill glutinous couplets about teamwork and customer care. These are corporate anthems - vainglorious paeans to company spirit, designed to entice clients and inspire staff. </p> <p>The tune (of sorts) above, extolling the virtues of chartered accountants KPMG and titled Our Vision of a Global Strategy, is just one among many - the tip of a terrible, oncoming iceberg. And it is not only corporate types who have fallen for the cult, an ear-splitting masterclass in kamikaze marketing. Last week it was announced that William Hague had commissioned an inspiring election theme for the Tories, penned by the songwriter Mike Batt, is the man behind Remember You're a Womble. </p> <p>But it doesn't end there. You can wig out to management consultancy Pricewaterhouse Coopers's Your World; sway to the lilting calypso of Media-Apps' Back To The Net (\"Aggregating information/It's a part of business\"); or savour a hip-hop number from IT specialists Asera, wherein the world's most soul less man opines that \"Asera's crib is the place to be\". </p> <p>There are more. Lots more. One anthem aficionado, Chris Raettig, has compiled a website dedicated to a startling collection of corporate musical horrors. Amid the litany of unlikely concepts claimed by journalists as the new rock'n'roll, the latest would appear to be corporate finance and customised software solutions. </p> <p>Not, however, that the companies' UK operations seem particularly keen. Call KPMG to discuss Our Vision Of Global Strategy, and you'll hear a slightly mirthless laugh. \"Er, it's Dutch,\" says a spokesman. \"It was written for a local marketing campaign. In Holland.\" Nothing to do with you then? \"Er, no. Definitely not.\" Neither, sadly, will Pricewaterhouse Coopers admit responsibility for Your World, and its rousing melange of driving keyboards and recruitment advice. \"Actually, it was done by one of our European branches. Funny, isn't it? Have you heard the one by KPMG?\" The sound of skeletons being hurriedly shoved back into cupboards is deafening. </p> <p>But that may change. Over at \"online creatives\" Bluewave - whose dance-flavoured Dive Right In is another popular draw on Raettig's site - the future, however atonal, beckons. Talking eagerly of \"audio identities as a part of corporate representation\", group brand director Pad Bray sees the company theme not as an embarrassment, but a potent weapon. \"Few things in the world can equal the power of music,\" he ponders. \"It can inspire, and corral. Lyrically, for instance, we wanted something that conveyed our brand, and our brand is tied in with the aquatic environment. Hence Dive Right In. The lyrics should fit the metaphor, yeah?\" </p> <p>This could be one of the reasons why the new wave of corporate rock is increasingly likely to be produced in-house. Bluewave's effort, for example, was put together by Bray over three days using the company's own facilities. \"Basically, we realised that with digital technology we could do this ourselves, rather than face the prohibitive cost of farming it out. So, within the company, I was able to provoke people. To say OK, put this in your ears and tell me how you feel.\" </p> <p>It's an oddly DIY ethic echoed by Asera's programme manager, Phillip Scarborough, writer and performer of both Asera Everywhere and Asera Leads The Way, who doesn't sound nearly so soulless talking from his San Francisco crib. \"Basically, I've always loved writing music, and my CEO asked if I'd do something for the firm. So I ended up with five potential anthems, met the board with my boombox, and they were just blown away.\" </p> <p>Still, you can't help wondering who these godless hymns are really for - morale-sapped employees, or wide-eyed prospective customers? The answer, apparently, is both. \"Obviously on one level, the tune is there to bring people together, happily working under one flag,\" says Bray. \"On another, it's about slotting in with the 360-degree branding.\" </p> <p>Scarborough is thinking along similar lines: \"It's supposed to rally the troops, but it's also supposed to put Asera's message across. The message that we're excited and we're here to stay.\" That, in the words of Asera Everywhere, you're hot, dope, def and fly? \"Exactly.\" </p> <p>For the likes of Bray and Scarborough, these are, of course, early days. Delicious as the prospect of tone-deaf accountants being cajoled into 9am singalongs may be, there isn't - yet - cause for alarm. But a few firms will admit to putting their anthems to stirring use - Dive Right In currently serves as the soundtrack to Bluewave's phone system, while Asera Everywhere is largely aired at \"company functions, Christmas parties, that kind of thing\". </p> <p>Bray, indeed, is convinced that the corporate future will be an even more melodic one. \"It's unexplored territory, yeah, but the aural logo is certainly getting bigger. And, once it's properly tied into the overall brand strategy, there'll be a time when you don't think of the company without thinking of its anthem.\" Ladies and gentlemen, please open your hymn books. </p> <p><strong>The corporate vibe: company songs reviewed</strong></p> <p><strong> KPMG </strong></p> <p><strong>Our Vision of a Global Strategy</strong> </p> <p>Sure, it's easy to laugh at KPMG's entry for the worst song of all time. But let's extend to Our Vision of a Global Strategy the compassion that the company clearly doesn't offer its own employees, who have to listen to it. After all, the unsung minion who wrote it won't even have the cold comfort of hearing his or her tune performed as France's Eurovision entry, which in another life would have been its fate. No slur intended on our Gallic cousins. French lounge music by the likes of Air is desperately hip at the moment, and if Our Vision were to be released under Air's name, its tootling synthesisers (nostalgically evocative of 60s test-card music) and choir of Jane \"The Cruise\" McDonalds (or session singers who sound just like her) would have trendy Hoxton Square types clawing their goatees in ecstasy. </p> <p>Best moment: when the main Jane spits out the line, \"We create/ We innovate/We pass the ones that are lay-ay-ayte.\" </p> <p><strong> Pricewaterhouse Coopers </strong></p> <p><strong>Your World</strong> </p> <p>Your World kicks off with a jaunty stutter of boogie-woogie piano, raising the possibility of Jools Holland being involved. But the spectre quickly recedes as percussion kicks in and a male voice takes the song in another direction entirely. There's a haunting familiarity to both his reedy tones and the unrhymed style as he swings into the second verse: \"We don't sell no dogma/What we gotta give/Pricewaterhouse Coopers/For each and every client.\" There's only one person who can sneer \"dogma\" with quite such a curled lip - could we be witnessing the corporate-jingle debut of Elvis Costello? And yet, moments later, he is joined by someone who could be Marie Osmond, then the entire Osmond clan, plus string section, who take it to a bumptious finale. Such perverseness would be within Costello's abilities.Yet the track is said to originate in Holland - off the beaten track for him - so we may never know. </p> <p><strong> Deutsche Bank </strong></p> <p><strong>Global Technology</strong> </p> <p>Deutsche Bank's offering makes a mockery of the German reputation for stodgy sobriety. It's obvious that someone had been at the schnapps here; in fact, it's likely that everyone from the songwriter to the arranger to the helium-voiced girl and boy vocalists were supping the same drug-enriched brew. Global Technology lurches through a bewildering panoply of styles: lofty prog-rock, psychedelia, house, eastern - and that's just the first 30 seconds. The male singer then cuts in, appositely, with, \"Global technology is no easy game to play/A new challenge for all of us, every day.\" You don't say. It's a challenge just to sit through this potpourri. Listen for the sound of a rocket blasting off toward the end, just before the singers reach a pinnacle of emotion. Best of the lot, no contest. </p> <p><strong>Caroline Sullivan</strong></p>",

Women make up 30-40% of middle management, but represent just 1% of all chief executive officers.\" An NOP poll commissioned by VSO found 51% of women would like the chance to work overseas. But more than 80% of women and men thought it was harder for women to gain respect in some foreign cultures. More than 60% of women and men said it was difficult for women to take up posts abroad because of family commitments. And nearly half said it was harder for women to work abroad than men. VSO said these public attitudes contrasted sharply with the evidence of its returning women volunteers. Most of the women volunteers were in their twenties and fifties. The older volunteers said they were prompted by freedom from family ties, an urge to see the world and travel with a purpose. The younger volunteers saw VSO as a boost to career prospects and said they were attracted by the sense of adventure. Ruth Lewis, the charity's director of recruitment, said: \"Here is evidence of a pool of female talent and ability waiting to be tapped, not just by VSO, but by the wider business community.\"",

His soloist in the Brahms is Garrick Ohlsson, who plays with strength and delicacy, though Runnicles finds the work's balance of classicism and romanticism tricky.

In the US, where welfare-to-work has cut rolls dramatically in many areas, programmes are struggling to adjust to the needs of remaining clients.
