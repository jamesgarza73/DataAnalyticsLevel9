MacLaurin has been fulminating privately to colleagues about an article by Christopher Martin-Jenkins in The Times describing Pack's sudden resignation a fortnight ago. The piece mentioned that the two top executives are close golfing friends: \"Pack, who leaves the board [ECB] in September, has been damned for being a golfing friend of the chairman... and was to some extent on a permanently tricky wicket at Lord's, a scene that he did not know sufficiently well at first.\" </p> <p>MacLaurin's privately expressed irritation will come as a bit of a shock to the mild-mannered CM-J, the paper's chief cricket correspondent and member of the BBC's Test Match Special team, whose strictly objective reporting rarely upsets people at any level of the game.

For that, read in thrall to the ECB and MCC line.</p> <p>MacLaurin apparently no longer sees CM-J as quite such a staunch ally. MacLaurin, former boss of the Tesco supermarket chain, is in some ways the grandest of ECB grandees. He was also responsible for one of the ECB's oddest appointments of recent years: Major-General Pack, 56, is a straight-laced, rather engaging, but decidedly traditional character whose previous military career - his last post was as Commander, British Forces, Gibraltar, 1994-97 - included no experience of the vicissitudes of cricket administration in an increasingly competitive, buzzy age. Whatever Pack's faults, it seems bizarre that it has taken MacLaurin three years to deny that he ever played golf with his protege.</p> <p>Why on earth could this matter? Well, as widely reported since Pack's 1997 appointment as the first - and probably last - International Teams Director, his selection owed a good deal to the fact that he had originally become friends with MacLaurin when playing golf at the Valderrama Club in southern Spain. That chance contact - which Pack appeared to confirm in the media as recently as June - may have helped alter the course of recent English cricketing history: Pack leaves shortly, able to take justified pride in being the architect of England central contracts, but with various black marks on his record. For example, his poor relations with many of England's stars. Don't forget his leading role in the hopelessly bungled pay negotiations with England's players, which helped derail the team's ill-fated World Cup bid.</p> <p>The most interesting question now, perhaps, is this: what was Pack's ECB pay-off?

However an ECB spokesman says: \"Rumours of a \u00a330,000 pay-off are wide of the mark.\" Whether the true figure is higher or lower, we're unlikely ever to know.

      "byline": "Betty Clarke",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Chris T-T creates fragmented songs that verge on the cool side of lo-fi without losing a love for all things pop. Standing in front of the mic, he's frightened; like an animal caught in headlights, his eyes dart as he begins Bubble, a punk-pop diversion with jagged guitars. Halfway through, T-T manages a quick \"Hello\", and a timid smile. </p> <p>It's not what you expect from a man who looks more than able to hold his own in a dirty brawl. He's big. He's hirsute. And his new album Panic at Sainsbury's proves he's the Phil Redmond of the DIY music scene, with its soap opera narratives of supermarkets and suburban love affairs at crisis point. While Badly Drawn Boy has lush arrangements full of sunshine and disappointment, T-T's bedroom is a much darker place. His songs are sweet on the outside, bitter at the centre, simple, often humorous gems with twisted lyrics. Similarly, his voice is ordinary, easy, Billy Bragg without the affectation, but has power when he chooses to unleash it. </p> <p>F Sharp has icy keyboards that create a sense of uneasiness. But nothing prepares you for its tale of domestic violence. \"I'm sorry I kicked you, Susan,\" T-T sings in a world-weary but unapologetic voice. He blinks, terror in his eyes as he catalogues reasons why the Susan in question deserved what she got. \"After I bruised you in the kitchen, now I know we'll never be apart.\" It's chilling. \"Yeah, erm, controversial one,\" he shrugs, the directness and strength of his lyrics strangers to him in real life. </p> <p>It's this ability to try on personae that makes T-T watchable. He becomes a series of characters all living out various scenes in a kitchen sink drama, while barely moving and never looking comfortable.

      "bodyText": "Chris T-T creates fragmented songs that verge on the cool side of lo-fi without losing a love for all things pop. Standing in front of the mic, he's frightened; like an animal caught in headlights, his eyes dart as he begins Bubble, a punk-pop diversion with jagged guitars. Halfway through, T-T manages a quick \"Hello\", and a timid smile. It's not what you expect from a man who looks more than able to hold his own in a dirty brawl. He's big. He's hirsute. And his new album Panic at Sainsbury's proves he's the Phil Redmond of the DIY music scene, with its soap opera narratives of supermarkets and suburban love affairs at crisis point. While Badly Drawn Boy has lush arrangements full of sunshine and disappointment, T-T's bedroom is a much darker place. His songs are sweet on the outside, bitter at the centre, simple, often humorous gems with twisted lyrics. Similarly, his voice is ordinary, easy, Billy Bragg without the affectation, but has power when he chooses to unleash it. F Sharp has icy keyboards that create a sense of uneasiness. But nothing prepares you for its tale of domestic violence. \"I'm sorry I kicked you, Susan,\" T-T sings in a world-weary but unapologetic voice. He blinks, terror in his eyes as he catalogues reasons why the Susan in question deserved what she got. \"After I bruised you in the kitchen, now I know we'll never be apart.\" It's chilling. \"Yeah, erm, controversial one,\" he shrugs, the directness and strength of his lyrics strangers to him in real life. It's this ability to try on personae that makes T-T watchable. He becomes a series of characters all living out various scenes in a kitchen sink drama, while barely moving and never looking comfortable. The most we get is his hand wiping sweat from his eyes as he sings of a number of highly inventive ways in which to kill pop stars - from Celine Dion to Sir Cliff Richard - in a beguiling but acid voice. And he can rock when he wants to. Sideshow Mel sees the amps turned up and his head go down as guitars screech and build to a blistering climax. \"Thank you. It's been very nice,\" T-T says faintly. Maybe nice isn't the right word. ***** Unmissable **** Recommended *** Enjoyable ** Mediocre * Terrible",

In the 28 weeks to July 22, pre-tax profits rose to \u00a355.2m from \u00a350.1m, with costs rising from \u00a3134.8m to \u00a3141.6m. \"Major investments in Smile and new mortgage processing systems had the effect of increasing overall costs by 5%,\" Mr Pedelty said. He refused to specify the size of Co-op Bank's investment in Smile but insisted it is far lower than reported figures for other start-ups. Smile directly employs only 130 people and Mr Pedelty said it was on target to move into profit in two years' time. \u0095 Bradford &amp; Bingley said yesterday it has spent \u00a330.1m in fees and costs for demutualising, ahead of its listing planned for December 4. Excluding exceptional costs, pre-tax profits jumped 76% to \u00a3140m.",

      "bodyText": "Darren Anderton has another sicknote. The Tottenham midfielder awaits the result of a MRI scan on his damaged groin but seems likely to be out of action for the next month and miss England's World Cup qualifier against Germany. Anderton tore his groin taking a corner in the first minute of Tuesday night's game against Everton, which Tottenham won 3-2. \"I couldn't believe it when it happened,\" he said. \"I hurt myself when I crossed the ball and, although I tried to carry on, there was no way I could. It felt like a tear straight away.\" Anderton has undergone groin surgery twice before, in 1997 and 1998. He has also suffered thigh, knee, hamstring and achilles tendon injuries. Duncan Ferguson is also out for a month. The Everton centre-forward underwent surgery yesterday to remove scar tissue from a calf muscle injury.

      "body": "<p>The excuses are familiar: I've got a headache, I'm too tired, it's the wrong time of the month. But now it's not just women who are finding reasons for avoiding sex. Contradicting age-old assumptions, more and more men are going off it and some of them are prepared to say so, in public and at length. The traditional male terror, not being able to get an erection, is being edged aside by men who say they feel used, abused and treated as sex objects - just like women 20 years ago.</p> <p>Sex therapists say this piece of role reversal has been going on for some time, long enough to start showing up in the statistics. But it was dramatically highlighted this week by the revelations of Jimmy Gulzar, estranged husband of Spice Girl Mel B, who has confided to the Sun that he refused to have sex with his wife for the final three months of their marriage. Another man, Alan Quigley, got into the tabloids last week when it was revealed, during a court case, that he wrote to his ex-girlfriend complaining that he felt like a \"typical woman\", only wanted for his body.</p> <p>This kind of problem is rarely discussed so openly but there is no doubt that it is cropping up more often. Julia Cole, a Relate-trained couple counsellor and author of After The Affair: How To Build Trust and Love Again, says that research carried out for Relate in 1996 showed that 7-8% of men seeking counselling said they had gone off sex. These were not, she points out, men with medical problems which meant they could not get an erection. For one reason or another - tiredness, stress, a feeling that the relationship had gone wrong - they were simply saying no to their partners.</p> <p>The latest research, says Cole, shows that the figure has doubled to 15%. \"There's been a steady climb since the 80s\", she says. \"Men want a partner who is considerate, sensitive and sensual. My experience in therapy over 12 years is that when you talk to men, they may start by saying they want more sex. But what they say after a while is that they want to be touched and caressed, in the same way as their partners.\"</p> <p>Does she mean - gulp - that men want foreplay? Yes, although not all of them realise it, says Cole. When couples are advised by sex therapists to concentrate on touching non- genital areas of the body, the men apparently find it \"a revelation\". Gulzar's problems with Scary Spice had probably gone way beyond the point where this kind of exercise could help, judging by the long list of complaints he laid bare over five pages of Monday's Sun. And he revealed a traditional male anxiety when he insisted, in inimitable tabloid style: \"I'm not gay... I went off sex after Mel put boob op before baby.\"</p> <p>What he claimed about their short union was that one partner wanted to stay at home and bring up baby Phoenix Chi while the other rushed back to their old life of late nights and clubbing, a familiar enough conflict except that this time it was the wife who wanted to party. (And who allegedly sneaked off to Los Angeles for breast enhancement surgery without telling her husband.) Gulzar said he was too angry with Mel to sleep with her again. \"For me, if my head ain't right, my willy ain't right,\" he added graphically.</p> <p>Quigley, whose ex-girlfriend went to the High Court asking for half of the house they had lived in together, complained that she had treated him like a male prostitute. \"I need to be appreciated, and not just because I can give you another orgasm,\" he declared in a letter submitted to the court.</p> <p>Gillian Walton, director of training and clinical services at London Marriage Guidance, confirms that in the early days of sex therapy this used to be a predominantly female cry for help. She believes that the problem of men feeling unloved or unappreciated was masked, in the past, by their tendency to display physical symptoms - erectile difficulties and premature ejaculation.</p> <p>\"It was a way of protecting the couple from admitting to disappointment,\" she says. What has happened since is a significant change in attitudes; sexual matters are much more in the open, women are no longer prepared to blame themselves for problems in bed, and men are less inhibited about discussing their own difficulties. Yet it is one thing for a man to admit to vulnerability and low self-esteem in private to a counsellor, and another to do it quite as publicly as Gulzar has done.</p> <p>That he is suffering from wounded pride, as well as limbering up for a bruising divorce court battle with his ex-love, is demonstrated by an incident at an awards ceremony when the American rap star Puff Daddy is said to have told him to take control of his woman.</p> <p>There is a confusion here between patriarchal attitudes, which crop up in embattled communities and account for the misogyny of rap stars like Puff Daddy and Eminem, and broader, biologically-based assumptions about male sexuality.</p> <p>One of these, the notion that male desire is almost entirely a physical phenomenon, stimulated visually and beyond men's control, still surfaces in rape cases. In the 21st century, defending barristers continue to claim that their clients could not control themselves on seeing a woman in a short skirt, a myth that is as insulting to men as it is dangerous to women. It has not been helped by the modish discipline of evolutionary psychology, whose most extreme exponents claim that men are genetically-programmed to rape in order to maximise the number of their offspring.</p> <p>The most recent claim of the neo-Darwinians, that women are naturally promiscuous in order to get the best quality sperm, is equally reductive. For what couple counsellors are seeing, in their current practice, is men and women who complain that they do not enjoy sex when it is perfunctory, about nothing but bodies and divorced from feeling. Some of them may be husbands or boyfriends, like Gulzar, who are acutely aware of an imbalance between their own status and that of their high-achieving partners.</p> <p>Yet, what also seems to be happening is the erosion of another stereotype, the male who can perform in all circumstances given the right stimuli. \"Perhaps there is a stage when men are very young and can be up for it just by looking at a sexy picture,\" says Cole. Beyond that, she believes, the men who come to her for help want more than a fantasy about an exciting stranger. \"It's a positive development,\" she adds, \"but it does expose their vulnerability.\"</p> <p>It's also a long way from the laddish culture of pin-ups and relentless male performance we became used to in the 90s. Perhaps that explains why these changes have been taking place, over the past couple of decades, largely behind closed doors. And it says something about our age that it has taken the spectacular break-up of a pop star's marriage to reveal that men, too, sometimes need to say no.</p>",

Contradicting age-old assumptions, more and more men are going off it and some of them are prepared to say so, in public and at length. The traditional male terror, not being able to get an erection, is being edged aside by men who say they feel used, abused and treated as sex objects - just like women 20 years ago. Sex therapists say this piece of role reversal has been going on for some time, long enough to start showing up in the statistics. But it was dramatically highlighted this week by the revelations of Jimmy Gulzar, estranged husband of Spice Girl Mel B, who has confided to the Sun that he refused to have sex with his wife for the final three months of their marriage. Another man, Alan Quigley, got into the tabloids last week when it was revealed, during a court case, that he wrote to his ex-girlfriend complaining that he felt like a \"typical woman\", only wanted for his body. This kind of problem is rarely discussed so openly but there is no doubt that it is cropping up more often. Julia Cole, a Relate-trained couple counsellor and author of After The Affair: How To Build Trust and Love Again, says that research carried out for Relate in 1996 showed that 7-8% of men seeking counselling said they had gone off sex. These were not, she points out, men with medical problems which meant they could not get an erection. For one reason or another - tiredness, stress, a feeling that the relationship had gone wrong - they were simply saying no to their partners. The latest research, says Cole, shows that the figure has doubled to 15%. \"There's been a steady climb since the 80s\", she says. \"Men want a partner who is considerate, sensitive and sensual. My experience in therapy over 12 years is that when you talk to men, they may start by saying they want more sex. But what they say after a while is that they want to be touched and caressed, in the same way as their partners.\" Does she mean - gulp - that men want foreplay? Yes, although not all of them realise it, says Cole. When couples are advised by sex therapists to concentrate on touching non- genital areas of the body, the men apparently find it \"a revelation\". Gulzar's problems with Scary Spice had probably gone way beyond the point where this kind of exercise could help, judging by the long list of complaints he laid bare over five pages of Monday's Sun. And he revealed a traditional male anxiety when he insisted, in inimitable tabloid style: \"I'm not gay... I went off sex after Mel put boob op before baby.\" What he claimed about their short union was that one partner wanted to stay at home and bring up baby Phoenix Chi while the other rushed back to their old life of late nights and clubbing, a familiar enough conflict except that this time it was the wife who wanted to party. (And who allegedly sneaked off to Los Angeles for breast enhancement surgery without telling her husband.) Gulzar said he was too angry with Mel to sleep with her again. \"For me, if my head ain't right, my willy ain't right,\" he added graphically. Quigley, whose ex-girlfriend went to the High Court asking for half of the house they had lived in together, complained that she had treated him like a male prostitute. \"I need to be appreciated, and not just because I can give you another orgasm,\" he declared in a letter submitted to the court. Gillian Walton, director of training and clinical services at London Marriage Guidance, confirms that in the early days of sex therapy this used to be a predominantly female cry for help. She believes that the problem of men feeling unloved or unappreciated was masked, in the past, by their tendency to display physical symptoms - erectile difficulties and premature ejaculation. \"It was a way of protecting the couple from admitting to disappointment,\" she says. What has happened since is a significant change in attitudes; sexual matters are much more in the open, women are no longer prepared to blame themselves for problems in bed, and men are less inhibited about discussing their own difficulties. Yet it is one thing for a man to admit to vulnerability and low self-esteem in private to a counsellor, and another to do it quite as publicly as Gulzar has done. That he is suffering from wounded pride, as well as limbering up for a bruising divorce court battle with his ex-love, is demonstrated by an incident at an awards ceremony when the American rap star Puff Daddy is said to have told him to take control of his woman. There is a confusion here between patriarchal attitudes, which crop up in embattled communities and account for the misogyny of rap stars like Puff Daddy and Eminem, and broader, biologically-based assumptions about male sexuality. One of these, the notion that male desire is almost entirely a physical phenomenon, stimulated visually and beyond men's control, still surfaces in rape cases. In the 21st century, defending barristers continue to claim that their clients could not control themselves on seeing a woman in a short skirt, a myth that is as insulting to men as it is dangerous to women. It has not been helped by the modish discipline of evolutionary psychology, whose most extreme exponents claim that men are genetically-programmed to rape in order to maximise the number of their offspring. The most recent claim of the neo-Darwinians, that women are naturally promiscuous in order to get the best quality sperm, is equally reductive. For what couple counsellors are seeing, in their current practice, is men and women who complain that they do not enjoy sex when it is perfunctory, about nothing but bodies and divorced from feeling. Some of them may be husbands or boyfriends, like Gulzar, who are acutely aware of an imbalance between their own status and that of their high-achieving partners. Yet, what also seems to be happening is the erosion of another stereotype, the male who can perform in all circumstances given the right stimuli. \"Perhaps there is a stage when men are very young and can be up for it just by looking at a sexy picture,\" says Cole. Beyond that, she believes, the men who come to her for help want more than a fantasy about an exciting stranger. \"It's a positive development,\" she adds, \"but it does expose their vulnerability.\" It's also a long way from the laddish culture of pin-ups and relentless male performance we became used to in the 90s. Perhaps that explains why these changes have been taking place, over the past couple of decades, largely behind closed doors. And it says something about our age that it has taken the spectacular break-up of a pop star's marriage to reveal that men, too, sometimes need to say no.",

Jeanette Winterson I use densities of poetry in my work - if poetry is the best words in the best order, then that is what I try to aim for. I read poetry all the time - if you want something fantastic, try Alice Oswald. She's great. rgsharp What are your plans for your website, now you've won your name back? Jeanette Winterson You can go into jeanettewinterson.com now, but the site won't be fully built until Nov 1. Have a look, see what you think. You could always try www winterson.net, a reader's site run by Anna Troberg. nsalt The electronic landscape seems very important and exciting to you but how much do you feel that having moved from urban to rural surroundings has changed your perception and writing? Jeanette Winterson nsalt - I can work anywhere. My move to the country was for personal reasons. I never work in a domestic space - the work is anti-social and messes up mealtimes. I do what I have always done - go off and take as long as the job tells me. tamara A London band called Alabama 3 wrote a song about religion/N Ireland called 'Orangemen Are Not The Only Fruits'. Not a lot of people know this. PS: Do you own a Powerbook? Jeanette Winterson tamara - No I didn't know that, it's cool. Yes I do own a powerbook. picasso3 I am interested in how you feel your work interacts with theory and literary criticism. For instance, my cultural theory class read Helene Cixous' \"L'ecriture feminine\" and I saw \"Written on the Body\" as a reply of sorts. Many try to locate your work within the postmodern, and have written about intertextuality. From reading your work, I have the sense that you want your work to speak for itself and that you want the reader to work as well, to interact with your writing. What do you think about theory/criticism? Am I mad, or does your work draw not only from novelists, poets, artists, and history, but also from theorists? Jeanette Winterson Picasso 3, no you're not mad, reviewers are often bonkers but readers are totally sane. I draw on everything I can find for my work - I'm a robber and a hoarder and a pawn broker and a collector. The trick is to merge all this stuff into my own preoccupations and make new connections and a new whole. What is important though, is that creative work influences theory and not the other way round.PS: I think Cixous is fabulous and not one of those intestinal theorists whose name, for instance, begins with F... Karlich Filling in the details to access this site, I was invited to 'choose' gender. Gender and identity being such a theme in your novels, I wondered if that's one of the things that drew you to placing your latest book in a cyber setting? Jeanette Winterson Karlich - Gender is a template, a beginning, a set of possibilities, it's not a rigid structure and should never be a prison. I'm interested in gender play not gender roles.

Where did it begin in your mind? Jeanette Winterson Thank you, that's great. The book wasn't written sequentially, it was in kit form on the floor for a long time.

The wee frees of UK politics swing about a bit. Setting the people free is good rhetoric, in tune with the party's past as well as a neat attempt to spike Tory guns, but much of the meat in this mini-manifesto is collectivist and, necessarily, coercive. For example, the party proposes to take the people's money, especially if they earn more than \u00a3100,000 a year motorists are to be charged and cajoled.</p> <p>Indeed on close inspection, they are as nannyish as the Blair government - and nothing wrong with that if it entails improving welfare and health services. The Lib Dems make much of taxing in order to spend: they are more transparent than the Blairites, but political intentions are similar.</p> <p>What they are not, sadly, is especially empiricist. Sharing the intentions of the Blair cabinet, Charles Kennedy and colleagues might have offered us their observations on why Labour has failed to come up to scratch. It would have been useful if the Lib Dems had registered for the public the constraints all would-be radicals face.

      "bodyText": "A political party's distinctiveness lies in some combination of positive policy and not being the other lot. The fate of third parties is to have two other lots from whom to distinguish themselves. Yesterday the Liberal Democrats affirmed that the greater distance is between themselves and the Tories. On the big issues - notably spending public money and Europe - elective affinity is with Labour. It is gross exaggeration (and historically ignorant) to label the Lib Dems \"socialist\" as some desperate Tory attempted yesterday but the party's ideological centre-left identity is stronger than ever. We are not talking precise compass bearings here. The wee frees of UK politics swing about a bit. Setting the people free is good rhetoric, in tune with the party's past as well as a neat attempt to spike Tory guns, but much of the meat in this mini-manifesto is collectivist and, necessarily, coercive. For example, the party proposes to take the people's money, especially if they earn more than \u00a3100,000 a year motorists are to be charged and cajoled. Indeed on close inspection, they are as nannyish as the Blair government - and nothing wrong with that if it entails improving welfare and health services. The Lib Dems make much of taxing in order to spend: they are more transparent than the Blairites, but political intentions are similar. What they are not, sadly, is especially empiricist. Sharing the intentions of the Blair cabinet, Charles Kennedy and colleagues might have offered us their observations on why Labour has failed to come up to scratch. It would have been useful if the Lib Dems had registered for the public the constraints all would-be radicals face. For example, freeing local government is an admirable end, but it could lead to less \"joined-upness\" in social and educational policy. In a sense, this party exists to snipe from on high, but some practical recommendations for the political sinners beneath them would have been useful.",

      "bodyText": "Scotland's education minister Sam Galbraith yesterday laid the blame for the country's exam crisis squarely on the Scottish qualifications authority and dodged renewed calls for his resignation. Facing the wrath of the Scottish parliament for the first time since the scandal broke, Mr Galbraith said he had done all he could to try and rectify the situation once it became apparent that there were serious problems with the results for the class of 2000. He apologised to the thousands of pupils who had suffered and promised everything possible would be done to pinpoint the causes and prevent it happening again. \"This was not of the students' own making or of the teachers, schools and colleges and it should not have happened,\" he said. \"We will find out exactly what went wrong.\" The parliament will conduct two separate inquiries into the debacle, and will take evidence from pupils, parents, and teachers as well as Mr Galbraith. In addition, the structure of the SQA is to be reviewed and an independent investigation into the authority will be carried out by consultants Deloitte Touche. At times looking flustered under a barrage of questions, Mr Galbraith said he had made \"sustained and frustrated\" efforts to discover the scale of the problems within the SQA once it became clear in March that all was not right. But opposition politicians continued to insist he should shoulder the blame for the fiasco and step down. \"He is guilty of presiding over the worst educational crisis in living memory,\" said Brian Monteith, the Scottish Conservatives' education spokesman. \"Will he not accept that he has failed thousand of pupils, parents and teachers and the only way to restore credibility in the Scottish education system is for him to resign?\" Mr Galbraith would not respond to that or to subsequent challenges to his position. It is four weeks since the SQA was forced to admit that the results for thousands of pupils sitting higher, standard grade, intermediate, and sixth year exams were flawed. Mr Galbraith said yesterday that more than 15,000 pupils had received incomplete or inaccurate results, and that 120,000 subject appeals had been lodged, almost three times the normal amount. He said that the university admissions body, Ucas, had confirmed that the number of Scottish candidates taking up university places this year was 2.6% up on last year. However, some schools still do not have complete results and many students have faced delays in finalising their places at university. It has also emerged that at least 25 families have started legal proceedings. The SQA has blamed the fiasco on data management and administrative problems and has already ousted a number of senior officials. Mr Galbraith said the appeals process was well under way and the process would be monitored by four senior directors of education. \"Schools and colleges, and more particularly, candidates, can have the confidence that the process for increased numbers of appeals will be robust,\" he said. Some Labour MSPs asked Mr Galbraith to ensure that the SQA could be held more accountable in future. The authority operates independently of the Scottish executive. It is understood Mr Galbraith may be looking at appointing an exams commissioner, who would report directly to the executive. Earlier, the executive was attacked by opposition MSPs for limiting discussion of the crisis. Some MSPs had called for a full debate today, but the executive curtailed the session to a ministerial statement and about an hour of questions. \"A statement is not adequate,\" said Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National Party. \"We have an obligation to have the debate that the parents, teachers and pupils of Scotland want.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<h2>Ithaka by Adele Geras (David Fickling Books, \u00a312.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504225\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2005/10/20/ithaka_final.jpg\" alt=\"Ithaka by Adele Geras\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/BerteShopWeb/viewProduct.do?ISBN=0385603916\">Buy Ithaka at the Guardian bookshop</a></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the story of the women who wait for Odysseus to return from Troy. Of the many versions of Homer's epic, this is the first - with apologies to James Joyce - to do justice to the women in the story. It's a home, rather than a homecoming, narrative. Touching and engaging.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>The Rainbow Opera by Elizabeth Knox (Faber)</h2> <p>First of two books about a world in which some people are able to control dreams. A political candidate pays a corrupt dreamcatcher to give people dreams promoting his candidacy. Cousins Laura (a dreamcatcher) and Rose (who doesn't have a skill) embark on a journey to discover that not all is well with the way dreams are being used.</p> <h2>The Moth Diaries by Rachel Klein (Faber, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504226\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2004/06/30/mothdiaries.jpg\" alt=\"The Moth Diaries\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>With teenagers flocking to see Mean Girls at the cinema this month, it's a good time to give them this book, a more literary take on the life of a 16-year-old girl cloistered in an American boarding school. The action takes place in the 1960s, but the girls' private dramas unfold in a rarefied world, isolated from the political turmoil of the anti-war demos going on outside. The narrator's best friend, Lucy, becomes enchanted with exotic new girl Ernessa, who has a terrifying secret. The narrator's diaries record her friend's distress, and the tragedies that result.</p> <h2>Time Switch by Matt Chamings (Faber, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Some time in the 1870s a boy invents a time machine. Then, in our time, another boy appears at the bottom of a family's garden. The story opens with a funeral in 1879, setting the tone for a tale that is scary, but also funny. This is Chamings' first book, written after he was made redundant, and it is a gripping story.</p> <h2>Poison by Chris Wooding (Scholastic, \u00a312.99)</h2> <p>Poison, stroppy adolescent par excellence, takes the blame when her baby sister is kidnapped. But this is an alternative world of phaeries and changelings. Poison sets off on a journey to rescue her sister, but soon comes up against the limits of her own willpower.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Viaduct Child by Patrick Wood (Scholastic, \u00a312.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504227\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/12/05/viaductchild.jpg\" alt=\"Viaduct Child\" width=\"128\" height=\"189\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Dushma is a non-person, living by a railway viaduct in a London that is recognisably like our own but also scarily different. Dushma is a non-person because a scan carried out when she was still in the womb showed that there was something odd about her brain. The state doesn't like anyone who might be a burden on resources. If you are not registered, you can't go to school, see a doctor or travel on public transport . . . you don't exist. So when the police raid her flat, Dushma escapes into the disused underground tunnels, where she joins up with a gang of teenagers living on their wits. This supremely confident first novel creates an all too believable future world of iron-gloved state control. And Wood doesn't cop out with any patronising \"happy ever afters\".<br> </p> <h2>Malka by Mirjam Pressler (Picador, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504228\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/12/05/malka.jpg\" alt=\"Malka\" width=\"128\" height=\"202\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It is September 1943. In the sleepy rural Polish backwater close to the Hungarian border, Jewish doctor Hannah Mai is burying her head in the sand, convinced that the Nazis will do her and her two daughters, teenage Minna and seven-year-old Malka, no harm. Then the round-up of Jews begins. Hannah sets off with her daughters towards the border. Then Malka falls sick and, faced with a kind of Sophie's Choice, Hannah takes the one chance offered to get herself and Minna to safety on the understanding that Malka will join them later. Instead, Malka ends up in a Jewish ghetto. Based on a true story, this is a powerful tale which explores not only the Holocaust, but also the complexities of motherhood and the reflexes that make us battle to survive.</p> <h2>Sabriel by Garth Nix (Collins, \u00a312.99)</h2> <p>Another fantasy novel with a strangely named heroine. But that is the only formulaic thing about Garth Nix's darkly complex novel. Sabriel is the daughter of Abhorsen, an \"Old Kingdom\" necromancer who can cross into the land of the dead. Sabriel has inherited his gift but attends a boarding school on the other side of the wall in the New Kingdom. The dead have a nasty habit of not staying dead in the Old Kingdom. When Sabriel receives a message from her father that he is trapped in death, she crosses the wall to try to save him and finds herself face to face with the forces of darkness. Nix weaves a thrilling adventure story as Sabriel must face her fears and journey into death. The writing displays both wit and charm - a rare gift in the fantasy genre.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Massive by Julia Bell (Young Picador, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>Novels for teenagers about eating disorders can be tricky. Bell's debut novel is tough, grimy and truthful as it looks at three women in the same family with food problems. For Carmen's mum Maria, thin equals success. She despairs of her podgy teenage daughter and, when a job opportunity arises in Birmingham, she whisks Carmen away to the big city. Soon Carmen is discovering her roots, including a grandmother who equates food with affection. Bell comes at her subject with a clever obliqueness, using the dislocated experience of the strange city to reflect Maria's and Carmen's fixations on food. A small chink of hope at the end suggests that Carmen will break the vicious circle and that the legacy will not be passed on.</p> <h2>Exodus by Julie Bertagna (Picador, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504229\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/11/15/Exodus.jpg\" alt=\"Exodus by Julie Bertagna\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It is the future. It is more than half a century since the fuel ran out, the oceans rose and drowned the cities, and the ships that supplied the island where Mara was born stopped coming. Now Mara's island is cut off and there is no future for her people. Using the defunct technology that was once the web, Mara discovers there might be a new world out there, with tall cities out of reach of the water.<br>This is a miracle of a novel, one that defies those critics who claim that teenagers don't need novels written specially for them. It has a memorable heroine, is written in stark, simple prose and uses an imaginatively created world to look at our own problems - whether it is global warming or the refugee crisis. This is a book you will remember for the rest of your life.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Dovey Coe by Frances O'Roark Dowell (Walker, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>On the cusp of adolescence, Dovey Coe watches the world intently, feels things strongly and always speaks her mind, which can get her into trouble. Particularly when her pretty elder sister, Caroline, starts toying with the affections of Parnell Caraway, the no-good local rich boy who always gets what he wants and would like to add Caroline to his collection. Over my dead body, thinks Dovey, but it is Parnell who ends up dead and Dovey on trial for his murder.<br>Frances O'Roark Dowell's novel is a delicately written account of life as an outsider in a rural American community in the 20s. Dovey is such a wonderful, strong character that she seems to speak directly to the reader, while the writing has the wistful quality of precious, long-distant memories.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>The Haunting Of Alaizabel Cray by Chris Wooding (Scholastic, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Chris Wooding's novel was passed over for these pages when it was published in hardback last year on the grounds that the cover looked like a record sleeve for a heavy metal band circa 1975 and the fact that it fell into the fantasy horror genre. Big mistake. Inside is one of the most intelligent, atmospheric and spine-tingling novels published for teenagers in recent years.<br>Wooding sets his novel in a London that is most certainly in the future but feels Victorian gothic, where a sinister Masonic society is plotting to take over, a curious Jack the Ripper stalks the streets and in the Old Quarter, overrun with wolves and wych-kin, young Thaniel is doing battle against baby-snatching ghouls, the influential Fraternity and the demons we conjure for ourselves. Breathtakingly brilliant.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Warehouse by Keith Gray (Red Fox, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504230\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/07/10/warehouse.jpg\" alt=\"Warehouse\" width=\"128\" height=\"197\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Warehouse is a place you can go when you've got nowhere else to go and have run out of money, options and even hope. It may be so rundown that even the young people who call it home describe it as \"Crap Palace\", but it is a place of safety in an uncertain and often dangerous world. Particularly for 15-year-old Robbie who is being used as a punchbag by his unhappy, vicious elder brother Frank, and for poor little rich girl Amy who set out to prove to her parents that she could hack it on her own but wound up in trouble within hours of leaving home.<br>Gray's novel is cleverly structured grabbing the reader by the scruff of the neck and pulling him or her into the entwining stories of this community of outcasts. Tough, tender and true.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>The Journal of Danny Chaucer (Poet) by Roger Stevens (Dolphin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Novels written in poetic form are big news in the US teenage fiction market, and this home-grown effort is up there with the best. Danny Chaucer is an Adrian Mole without the wimpishness or pomposity, and the gap between Danny's fantasy life and reality is wittily chronicled in a story that follows the thyth of the school year, first love and loss, and all the pains of growing up. Particularly the sledgehammer blow when his best friend goes off with Jenny, the girl of his dreams.<br>Stevens' verse is jaunty, knowing and tart and he gets right inside the dark, dark corners of the adolescent male mind. Although the verse form may take a page or two to get used to, it actually makes this an easier and less daunting book for reluctant readers than the traditional prose novel.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Fake by KK Beck (Scholastic Press, \u00a37.99)</h2> <p>Danny has been having problems with his mum and unsympathetic stepdad. Even so, it comes as a shock when he is forcibly shipped off to the Utah desert to attend a jackboot training camp for kids with \"behavioural issues\". Only, he never gets there. Keith, also being escorted to the camp, has a go at the escorts with a crow bar and goes on the run with Danny. But keith has his own interests in mind.<br>This is a thumpingly good thriller, cleverly plotted and tightly written, with a growing Kafkaesque quality as Danny realises that his identity has been stolen and there is nothing he can do about it. As perceptive on parental agendas as it is on teenagers' needs and mindsets, Beck's novel is a racy read with plenty to ponder.</p> <h2>Number 99 by Patrick Cave (Oxford University Press, \u00a36.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504231\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/04/24/number99.jpg\" alt=\"Number 99\" width=\"128\" height=\"204\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When the camp where 13-year-old traveller Kez lives is raided by police, she thinks it is just another example of prejudiced attitudes towards people with an alternative lifestyle. But with her mother mysteriously missing and the authorities behaving very strangely, it soon becomes apparent that something more sinister is going on. Placed as the 99th foster child of a kindly woman in Camberwell, Kez hooks up with foster child number one (now a flash success in the civil service), and a local boy who is an outcast of a different kind, to get to the bottom of things. Cave's very readable novel doesn't quite hang together as seamlessly as a good thriller should, but the theme is developed without moralising or sentimentality as the novel perceptively considers different ways of life and the choices we make about how we want to live.</p> <h2>Spindle's End by Robin McKinley (David Fickling, \u00a310.99)</h2> <p>When young Katriona pulls the lot that wins her a chance to go to the big city for the little princess's christening day, it changes her life. Suddenly, she finds herself responsible for a tiny little baby whose life is under threat. There are times when ordinariness is the very best disguise something - or someone - can have, and life in Katriona's village doesn't come more ordinary. Ordinary, that is, for a country where magic is \"so thick and tenacious that it settled over the land like chalk dust\". I would recommend very few of the novels written for teenagers that pass through my hands to a discerning adult reader. So this is a bit of a find. An extraordinarily imaginative retelling of the Sleeping Beauty fairytale, McKinley's book is genuinely enchanting but emotionally tough.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Break Point by Rosie Rushton (Piccadilly Press, \u00a36.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504232\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/03/27/breakpoint.jpg\" alt=\"Break Point\" width=\"128\" height=\"197\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Sixteen-year-old Emily is fantastic at tennis and could have a glittering career ahead of her, particularly now that she's won a scholarship to a famous tennis academy. Emily's mum, a single parent, who has scrimped and saved to help Emily on her way, is over the moon. There is just one problem: Emily has had quite enough of tennis. She wants a social life and a chance to stay on at school and do A-levels, go to university and maybe work with an aid agency in Africa. It shows how three successive generations of women - daughter, mother and grandmother- are confined or liberated not just by circumstance and the era into which they were born, but also by the personal choices they make. The teenager who reads this could end up looking at her mother differently.</p> <h2>Changing Emma by John Brindley (Dolphin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>On the day Emma gets her GCSE results, her parents win \u00a323m on the lottery. Only her gran remembers to tell her how well she has done. But who cares about school and GCSEs when you are rich beyond your wildest dreams? Soon, old friends are forgotten as Emma is living it up, attracting the attention of the local dreamboat and feeling like a million dollars. This is an old-fashioned morality tale dressed up in a racy, contemporary format and one that is memorable for the way it gets right under its anti-heroine's skin to portray the pain of knowing that you are behaving really badly but unable to stop. Even if they haven't won \u00a323m, most teenagers have been to some of the dark emotional places Emma visits here.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Wicca: Book of Shadows by Cate Tiernan (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504233\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/02/14/wicca.jpg\" alt=\"Wicca: Shadows\" width=\"128\" height=\"191\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Do you have a teenage daughter who loves Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek? Perhaps she is a rather reluctant reader, but don't despair - help is at hand with this new series that crosses high school angst and romance with witchcraft. Sixteen-year-old Morgan is the shy one in a crowd led by her stunning best friend Bree. But when Cal, an attractive new boy, arrives in town and invites them all to join a coven, Morgan finds herself the centre of attention. The discovery that she is a blood witch brings tensions to the surface and romance to a head. Despite the witchcraft, it does deal realistically and sensitively with teenage worries. A new book will be published each month between now and August.</p> <p><br></p> <h2>Thursday's Child by Sonia Hartnett (Walker, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>It is the worst years of the Great Depression, and Harper Flute and her family are struggling to survive in a shanty shack on a dusty, unforgiving piece of land. On the day the new baby arrives, Harper takes little brother Tin fishing. Buried in a mud slide, Tin miraculously survives but can't stop tunnelling. Soon he is living permanently underneath the shack burrowing away, with consequences that are both tragic and liberating. In its evocation of the adult world seen through the eyes of a child, this book has the feel of an American classic, such as To Kill a Mockingbird - although its author is Australian. Certainly, few British novelists for young people deliver with such density or so uncompromisingly. Hartnett writes without self-censorship or artificial boundaries between adult and children ' s literature. The result is a deep, and deeply moving, novel.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Ithaka by Adele Geras (David Fickling Books, \u00a312.99) This is the story of the women who wait for Odysseus to return from Troy. Of the many versions of Homer's epic, this is the first - with apologies to James Joyce - to do justice to the women in the story. It's a home, rather than a homecoming, narrative. Touching and engaging. The Rainbow Opera by Elizabeth Knox (Faber) First of two books about a world in which some people are able to control dreams. A political candidate pays a corrupt dreamcatcher to give people dreams promoting his candidacy. Cousins Laura (a dreamcatcher) and Rose (who doesn't have a skill) embark on a journey to discover that not all is well with the way dreams are being used. The Moth Diaries by Rachel Klein (Faber, \u00a39.99) With teenagers flocking to see Mean Girls at the cinema this month, it's a good time to give them this book, a more literary take on the life of a 16-year-old girl cloistered in an American boarding school. The action takes place in the 1960s, but the girls' private dramas unfold in a rarefied world, isolated from the political turmoil of the anti-war demos going on outside. The narrator's best friend, Lucy, becomes enchanted with exotic new girl Ernessa, who has a terrifying secret. The narrator's diaries record her friend's distress, and the tragedies that result. Time Switch by Matt Chamings (Faber, \u00a35.99) Some time in the 1870s a boy invents a time machine. Then, in our time, another boy appears at the bottom of a family's garden. The story opens with a funeral in 1879, setting the tone for a tale that is scary, but also funny. This is Chamings' first book, written after he was made redundant, and it is a gripping story. Poison by Chris Wooding (Scholastic, \u00a312.99) Poison, stroppy adolescent par excellence, takes the blame when her baby sister is kidnapped. But this is an alternative world of phaeries and changelings. Poison sets off on a journey to rescue her sister, but soon comes up against the limits of her own willpower. Viaduct Child by Patrick Wood (Scholastic, \u00a312.99) Dushma is a non-person, living by a railway viaduct in a London that is recognisably like our own but also scarily different. Dushma is a non-person because a scan carried out when she was still in the womb showed that there was something odd about her brain. The state doesn't like anyone who might be a burden on resources. If you are not registered, you can't go to school, see a doctor or travel on public transport . . . you don't exist. So when the police raid her flat, Dushma escapes into the disused underground tunnels, where she joins up with a gang of teenagers living on their wits. This supremely confident first novel creates an all too believable future world of iron-gloved state control. And Wood doesn't cop out with any patronising \"happy ever afters\". Malka by Mirjam Pressler (Picador, \u00a39.99) It is September 1943. In the sleepy rural Polish backwater close to the Hungarian border, Jewish doctor Hannah Mai is burying her head in the sand, convinced that the Nazis will do her and her two daughters, teenage Minna and seven-year-old Malka, no harm. Then the round-up of Jews begins. Hannah sets off with her daughters towards the border. Then Malka falls sick and, faced with a kind of Sophie's Choice, Hannah takes the one chance offered to get herself and Minna to safety on the understanding that Malka will join them later. Instead, Malka ends up in a Jewish ghetto. Based on a true story, this is a powerful tale which explores not only the Holocaust, but also the complexities of motherhood and the reflexes that make us battle to survive. Sabriel by Garth Nix (Collins, \u00a312.99) Another fantasy novel with a strangely named heroine. But that is the only formulaic thing about Garth Nix's darkly complex novel. Sabriel is the daughter of Abhorsen, an \"Old Kingdom\" necromancer who can cross into the land of the dead. Sabriel has inherited his gift but attends a boarding school on the other side of the wall in the New Kingdom. The dead have a nasty habit of not staying dead in the Old Kingdom. When Sabriel receives a message from her father that he is trapped in death, she crosses the wall to try to save him and finds herself face to face with the forces of darkness. Nix weaves a thrilling adventure story as Sabriel must face her fears and journey into death. The writing displays both wit and charm - a rare gift in the fantasy genre. Massive by Julia Bell (Young Picador, \u00a39.99) Novels for teenagers about eating disorders can be tricky. Bell's debut novel is tough, grimy and truthful as it looks at three women in the same family with food problems. For Carmen's mum Maria, thin equals success. She despairs of her podgy teenage daughter and, when a job opportunity arises in Birmingham, she whisks Carmen away to the big city. Soon Carmen is discovering her roots, including a grandmother who equates food with affection. Bell comes at her subject with a clever obliqueness, using the dislocated experience of the strange city to reflect Maria's and Carmen's fixations on food. A small chink of hope at the end suggests that Carmen will break the vicious circle and that the legacy will not be passed on. Exodus by Julie Bertagna (Picador, \u00a39.99) It is the future. It is more than half a century since the fuel ran out, the oceans rose and drowned the cities, and the ships that supplied the island where Mara was born stopped coming. Now Mara's island is cut off and there is no future for her people. Using the defunct technology that was once the web, Mara discovers there might be a new world out there, with tall cities out of reach of the water. This is a miracle of a novel, one that defies those critics who claim that teenagers don't need novels written specially for them. It has a memorable heroine, is written in stark, simple prose and uses an imaginatively created world to look at our own problems - whether it is global warming or the refugee crisis. This is a book you will remember for the rest of your life. Dovey Coe by Frances O'Roark Dowell (Walker, \u00a34.99) On the cusp of adolescence, Dovey Coe watches the world intently, feels things strongly and always speaks her mind, which can get her into trouble. Particularly when her pretty elder sister, Caroline, starts toying with the affections of Parnell Caraway, the no-good local rich boy who always gets what he wants and would like to add Caroline to his collection. Over my dead body, thinks Dovey, but it is Parnell who ends up dead and Dovey on trial for his murder. Frances O'Roark Dowell's novel is a delicately written account of life as an outsider in a rural American community in the 20s. Dovey is such a wonderful, strong character that she seems to speak directly to the reader, while the writing has the wistful quality of precious, long-distant memories. The Haunting Of Alaizabel Cray by Chris Wooding (Scholastic, \u00a35.99) Chris Wooding's novel was passed over for these pages when it was published in hardback last year on the grounds that the cover looked like a record sleeve for a heavy metal band circa 1975 and the fact that it fell into the fantasy horror genre. Big mistake. Inside is one of the most intelligent, atmospheric and spine-tingling novels published for teenagers in recent years. Wooding sets his novel in a London that is most certainly in the future but feels Victorian gothic, where a sinister Masonic society is plotting to take over, a curious Jack the Ripper stalks the streets and in the Old Quarter, overrun with wolves and wych-kin, young Thaniel is doing battle against baby-snatching ghouls, the influential Fraternity and the demons we conjure for ourselves. Breathtakingly brilliant. Warehouse by Keith Gray (Red Fox, \u00a34.99) The Warehouse is a place you can go when you've got nowhere else to go and have run out of money, options and even hope. It may be so rundown that even the young people who call it home describe it as \"Crap Palace\", but it is a place of safety in an uncertain and often dangerous world. Particularly for 15-year-old Robbie who is being used as a punchbag by his unhappy, vicious elder brother Frank, and for poor little rich girl Amy who set out to prove to her parents that she could hack it on her own but wound up in trouble within hours of leaving home. Gray's novel is cleverly structured grabbing the reader by the scruff of the neck and pulling him or her into the entwining stories of this community of outcasts. Tough, tender and true. The Journal of Danny Chaucer (Poet) by Roger Stevens (Dolphin, \u00a34.99) Novels written in poetic form are big news in the US teenage fiction market, and this home-grown effort is up there with the best. Danny Chaucer is an Adrian Mole without the wimpishness or pomposity, and the gap between Danny's fantasy life and reality is wittily chronicled in a story that follows the thyth of the school year, first love and loss, and all the pains of growing up. Particularly the sledgehammer blow when his best friend goes off with Jenny, the girl of his dreams. Stevens' verse is jaunty, knowing and tart and he gets right inside the dark, dark corners of the adolescent male mind. Although the verse form may take a page or two to get used to, it actually makes this an easier and less daunting book for reluctant readers than the traditional prose novel. Fake by KK Beck (Scholastic Press, \u00a37.99) Danny has been having problems with his mum and unsympathetic stepdad. Even so, it comes as a shock when he is forcibly shipped off to the Utah desert to attend a jackboot training camp for kids with \"behavioural issues\". Only, he never gets there. Keith, also being escorted to the camp, has a go at the escorts with a crow bar and goes on the run with Danny. But keith has his own interests in mind. This is a thumpingly good thriller, cleverly plotted and tightly written, with a growing Kafkaesque quality as Danny realises that his identity has been stolen and there is nothing he can do about it. As perceptive on parental agendas as it is on teenagers' needs and mindsets, Beck's novel is a racy read with plenty to ponder. Number 99 by Patrick Cave (Oxford University Press, \u00a36.99) When the camp where 13-year-old traveller Kez lives is raided by police, she thinks it is just another example of prejudiced attitudes towards people with an alternative lifestyle. But with her mother mysteriously missing and the authorities behaving very strangely, it soon becomes apparent that something more sinister is going on. Placed as the 99th foster child of a kindly woman in Camberwell, Kez hooks up with foster child number one (now a flash success in the civil service), and a local boy who is an outcast of a different kind, to get to the bottom of things. Cave's very readable novel doesn't quite hang together as seamlessly as a good thriller should, but the theme is developed without moralising or sentimentality as the novel perceptively considers different ways of life and the choices we make about how we want to live. Spindle's End by Robin McKinley (David Fickling, \u00a310.99) When young Katriona pulls the lot that wins her a chance to go to the big city for the little princess's christening day, it changes her life. Suddenly, she finds herself responsible for a tiny little baby whose life is under threat. There are times when ordinariness is the very best disguise something - or someone - can have, and life in Katriona's village doesn't come more ordinary. Ordinary, that is, for a country where magic is \"so thick and tenacious that it settled over the land like chalk dust\". I would recommend very few of the novels written for teenagers that pass through my hands to a discerning adult reader. So this is a bit of a find. An extraordinarily imaginative retelling of the Sleeping Beauty fairytale, McKinley's book is genuinely enchanting but emotionally tough. Break Point by Rosie Rushton (Piccadilly Press, \u00a36.99) Sixteen-year-old Emily is fantastic at tennis and could have a glittering career ahead of her, particularly now that she's won a scholarship to a famous tennis academy. Emily's mum, a single parent, who has scrimped and saved to help Emily on her way, is over the moon. There is just one problem: Emily has had quite enough of tennis. She wants a social life and a chance to stay on at school and do A-levels, go to university and maybe work with an aid agency in Africa. It shows how three successive generations of women - daughter, mother and grandmother- are confined or liberated not just by circumstance and the era into which they were born, but also by the personal choices they make. The teenager who reads this could end up looking at her mother differently. Changing Emma by John Brindley (Dolphin, \u00a34.99) On the day Emma gets her GCSE results, her parents win \u00a323m on the lottery. Only her gran remembers to tell her how well she has done. But who cares about school and GCSEs when you are rich beyond your wildest dreams? Soon, old friends are forgotten as Emma is living it up, attracting the attention of the local dreamboat and feeling like a million dollars. This is an old-fashioned morality tale dressed up in a racy, contemporary format and one that is memorable for the way it gets right under its anti-heroine's skin to portray the pain of knowing that you are behaving really badly but unable to stop. Even if they haven't won \u00a323m, most teenagers have been to some of the dark emotional places Emma visits here. Wicca: Book of Shadows by Cate Tiernan (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Do you have a teenage daughter who loves Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Dawson's Creek? Perhaps she is a rather reluctant reader, but don't despair - help is at hand with this new series that crosses high school angst and romance with witchcraft. Sixteen-year-old Morgan is the shy one in a crowd led by her stunning best friend Bree. But when Cal, an attractive new boy, arrives in town and invites them all to join a coven, Morgan finds herself the centre of attention. The discovery that she is a blood witch brings tensions to the surface and romance to a head. Despite the witchcraft, it does deal realistically and sensitively with teenage worries. A new book will be published each month between now and August. Thursday's Child by Sonia Hartnett (Walker, \u00a34.99) It is the worst years of the Great Depression, and Harper Flute and her family are struggling to survive in a shanty shack on a dusty, unforgiving piece of land. On the day the new baby arrives, Harper takes little brother Tin fishing. Buried in a mud slide, Tin miraculously survives but can't stop tunnelling.

The shock news from this part of the world - besides the temperature, which is as warm as a woolly wombat - is that this very tendon is to be operated on later this week leaving the hunky young Australian out of action for at least three months, and maybe until the new year. Hang on a minute, I'd better hide, there's a team of spies trying to hunt me down in a tiny submarine.</p> <p>That's better (I've hidden between the toes). Anyway, while Harry's tendon has not snapped, it has been painful since the end of last season and the operation will look to tidy up the sheath of the tendon (take it from me, it looks like a squat). A long period of rehabilitation will follow, and so Harry will definitely miss Leeds' matches in the first group stage of Big Cup.

All of which makes us want to join the Euro love boat, get on down with the member nations and give them some serious loving - which, after all, is what the EU is all about.

The Olympian will offer full results, top analysis, a comprehensive guide to coming events and the best gossip. http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/olympian * * * * * * * * * * * * * GUN DEAL Arsenal have today announced a multi-million pound partnership with Granada and the advantages look set to be enormous. Lee Dixon, for example, could jump to the front of the queue in a Granada service station if he is in a rush. Ray Parlour will be entitled to phone up any Granada employee at any time of the day or night, and ask them what's going on in Coronation Street. Meanwhile Silvinho could land the job of his dreams as a presenter on the Baby Channel. This may all sound a touch fantastical. That's because it is. But all the same the Gunners have done a deal with Granada Media today, selling them 5% of the club (rising to the customary 9.9% if the proposed new stadium goes ahead) as well as a 50/50 share in new company AFC Broadband (so that in future years you'll be able to watch Ray Parlour misplace a pass on your mobile phone). Granada Media will get all this for a combined fee of \u00a347m, plus a couple of Blind Date goody bags. They now have online/broadband deals with the three biggest clubs in the country, following similar arrangements with Liverpool and Man Utd. As is often the case when you've just been handed the GDP of Botswana, Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood was in a pretty chipper mood today. \"This partnership will assist us in meeting Arsenal's two strategic objectives,\" he said. \"First, to build both a world-class team and a new stadium with an increased capacity. Secondly, to develop the Arsenal brand on a global basis by extending our fanbase around the world.\" And what better way to enhance your image than teaming up with the makers of This Morning? * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"We could not handle the pressure. We felt it when we were 2-1 up with 15 minutes to go and could see so many quality players against us.\" Gianluca Vialli. With \"quality players\" to face, no wonder Luca's highly-paid World Cup-winning defenders bottled it. * * * * * * * * * * * * * KEWELL RUNNINGS Hi, it's Dennis Quaid Fiver here, and I'm presenting this story from inside Harry Kewell's achilles tendon in a scene reminiscent of my 1987 hit movie Innerspace. The shock news from this part of the world - besides the temperature, which is as warm as a woolly wombat - is that this very tendon is to be operated on later this week leaving the hunky young Australian out of action for at least three months, and maybe until the new year. Hang on a minute, I'd better hide, there's a team of spies trying to hunt me down in a tiny submarine. That's better (I've hidden between the toes). Anyway, while Harry's tendon has not snapped, it has been painful since the end of last season and the operation will look to tidy up the sheath of the tendon (take it from me, it looks like a squat). A long period of rehabilitation will follow, and so Harry will definitely miss Leeds' matches in the first group stage of Big Cup. Leeds are yet to comment on developments, which leaves me free to go surfing down Harry's alimentary canal. Check ya later kids! * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Chilean striker Marcelo Salas could be about to move to Real Madrid, according to reports. Madrid coach Vicente del Bosque today admitted: \"Salas is a player anyone would like in their team.\" He also refused to deny that the Chilean has attended a meeting with the club's technical director Jorge Valdano. Birmingham and Preston have enquired about taking Celtic striker Mark Burchill on loan. Middlesbrough want to give a trial to Norwegian U-18 star Morten Gamst Pedersen, according to his club Tromso. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Arsenal have won their battle with Nigeria after the Olympic champions omitted Kanu from the squad to defend their title in Sydney. \"We regret Kanu's absence but then there are other players we believe could equally represent Nigeria,\" said Nigeria FA spokesman Austin Mgbolu earlier today. Robbie Fowler is due to play his first game of the season next Monday. The Liverpool striker returned to full training this week and should feature in the reserve team match against Sheffield Wednesday. Celtic manager Martin O'Neill has been rewarded for his side's start to the season by winning the Bank of Scotland Manager of the Month award for August. Terry Phelan today claimed that he is suffering from stress and says he has almost certainly played his final game for Fulham. The former Republic of Ireland international, who has not trained for two weeks, said: \"When I was at training last time I was not in the right frame of mind so I went home - I felt like killing someone. I went straight to the doctor and he said it was stress.\" Huddersfield chairman Ian Ayre will step down at the end of the month to take up a new role with Premium TV. Ipswich chairman David Sheepshanks has been released from hospital after being admitted with severe breathing difficulties. Bristol Rovers have agreed a fee of \u00a3250,000 with WBA for striker Micky Evans. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Sky Sports 1: Fifa TV (7pm) Are you missing your favourite Thursday evening TV detective?

The machine is designed to zip and unzip a suitcase over and over again until the zipper breaks. </p> <p>Here, in an anonymous corporate box near the railroad station, is the Consumers' Association's research and testing centre, where grown men in white coats test everything from lawn mowers to luggage with intense and impartial rigour, in many cases until the wheels come off. </p> <p>The Consumers' Association is a charity launched in a garage in Bethnal Green in 1957, when the results of its first product tests were announced in the inaugural issue of its 10-shilling consumer magazine, Which?. Since then the testing facilities have grown to include a staff of 80 working on this 5,000 sq metre site. </p> <p>Most of the test results end up in the pages of various Which? publications, but the research and testing centre is increasingly engaged in \"externally commissioned research\" for clients including the government, the European Commission, the World Health Organisation and manufacturers at home and abroad. What sets CA's testing centre apart, says Evans, head of external programmes, is both its independence and its ability to test products to beyond most accepted standards. \"We look for what would be normal misuse of a product,\" he says. \"For example, the standard test for a screwdriver is for screwing screws in and taking them out. We do that, of course, but we also test it for levering off the lid from a can of paint.\" As he speaks, coffee is still dripping on to the carpet from a machine which some moments earlier spontaneously overflowed. (This was not a test, but an attempt to make coffee.) </p> <p>The laboratory floor is quiet at the end of the summer, with many of the boffins still on holiday and several bouts of testing either just finished or just about to start, but the place is never closed. Ranks of refrigerators for the Hong Kong market are being tested for energy efficiency in a sealed chamber which mimics the heat and humidity of southeast Asia. Inside each fridge the shelves are stacked with slabs of plastic jelly simulating red meat, and each of these is pierced with more than a dozen temperature probes attached to a computer. </p> <p>With its staff of 80, the centre tests virtually every type of product - white goods, \"brown\" goods (TVs, CDs and video recorders), secateurs and cars - except foodstuffs and textiles. </p> <p>The testing regimes and the machines that perform them are, in most cases, developed on site. Some are astonishingly technical, some refreshingly jerry-built. On the tour, Evans demonstrates a belt-driven wooden tombola which, when spinning end over end, can simulate a mobile phone repeatedly falling from a certain height - so they can determine how many falls it takes to break one. </p> <p>The extent of most of the regimes is staggering. Cameras are subjected to 316 separate tests. Their standard paint tests require five years of outdoor weathering. Each dishwasher tested receives an identical load of crockery, which is hand-soiled with identical samples of food debris, then baked. Lawnmowers have to go on trial before consumers purchase them in the early spring, so each winter the new crop is shipped to Florida to be tested on lawns sown with UK grass. Washing machines are tested with swatches of cloth pre-impregnated with red wine, chocolate and blood. \"Our stains come from Switzerland, but our vacuum cleaner dirt comes from Sweden,\" says Evans, who remembers the old days when the blood came from the local abattoir - and he was the one who was sent to get it. </p> <p>In addition to expert testing, CA uses rafts of ordinary consumers to determine the user-friendliness of products, particularly with regard to children and the elderly. In the situation room devoted to consumer testing, a map of the area around Milton Keynes is dotted with colour-coded flags to show the distribution of electric shavers and gardening equipment currently on trial. </p> <p>Some of the products they test here are subsequently sold at auction, but most are so damaged by the experiments that they are dangerous. The corridors are littered with microwaves and blenders with green \"unsafe\" stickers on them, alongside junked test equipment, which will eventually be cannibalised to construct new test equipment. In a side room, the white-coated Andy Gordon presides over an appliance chamber of horrors, where Polaroids of toasters in flames sit alongside the burnt-out remains. Among the serried ranks of badly-designed products, Gorman picks out a few personal favourites, including a juice extractor with an alarming tendency to suck spilled liquid into its own electrics through its cooling fan, and a food processor which, under certain conditions, allows your hands complete access to its whirling blades. Gorman indicates a charred sandwich grill sitting forlornly on a workbench. Current standards do not require such appliances to have a thermal fuse, and in this case the manufacturers declined to fit one. \"They said it was because the appliance had no combustible parts,\" says Gorman. \"That's when I switched on the video.\" </p> <p>After seeing Gorman's snuff film, the manufacturers are reconsidering their position, but it is not just the makers of products who are brought into line by such testing. Much of the work done here ends up shaping the standards by which the safety of these products is judged. Along with all the consumer product testing, CA are understandably proud of the work they do on behalf of Unicef and the Overseas Development Agency, which includes testing vaccine preservation equipment under conditions of tropical heat, high humidity and irregular electricity supply. </p> <p>And in a tiny room near the auto mobile testing facilities, engineers have sunk three bore holes of varying depths in order to test the efficiency of hand-operated pumps, as part of a programme to provide developing nations with greater access to clean drinking water.

The company booked an interim profit after tax and excluding exceptional items of \u00a3239m compared with \u00a336m for the same period, a performance which chief executive Pierre Jungels described as \"stunning.\" Shares in the company soared to a fresh year high, hitting 610p before finishing the day up 19.5p at 594.5p as the City pencilled in full year profits of around \u00a3440m. Mr Jungels said the huge upturn in crude prices had boosted the figures but said the company had played a big part by increasing production by 40%. Enterprise, criticised like others in the sector for offering investors poor returns over longer commodity cycles, would not be loosening its tight financial controls just be cause oil had hit a ten year high. \"We will continue to maintain our capital discipline and seek to generate shareholder value throughout the cycle,\" he said, pointing out that capital expenditure would only be increased 10% this year. Enterprise produced a return on capital employed of around 23% on an annualised basis which was better than both BP and Shell, which also produced strong results, industry experts said. But they pointed out that the UK explorer had none of the downstream refining operations owned by the majors which suffer from high crude prices but protect group margins when oil prices are low. Iain Reid, analyst with UBS Warburg said the Enterprise performance overall was solid but he warned oil prices were likely to dip next year, bringing company profits down with them. \"This is probably the high-water mark for the entire exploration and production sector,\" he said.

      "trailText": "<p>Barkbelly, Little Darlings, You Have Ghost Mail and other great reads for this age group</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<h2>Barkbelly, by Cat Weatherill (Puffin, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797910\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2005/04/27/bark2.jpg\" alt=\"Barkbelly by Cat Weatherill\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When a childless, elderly married couple find a beautiful egg made out of ash in a field, they take it home and rest it on their mantelpiece, only to find it hatching a few days later. Barkbelly - a wooden child - is born. Much stronger than the other children his age, he kills a playmate during a pretend bull-fighting session. Barkbelly has to run away.</p> <h2>Little Darlings by Sam Llewellyn (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Primrose, Cassian and Daisy live with their rich father and stepmother who farm them out to a series of luckless nannies. So far, so Mary Poppins, but then Nanny Pete takes over and they end up stuck between two rival gangs of burglars. We've had this in the house for months and it has become dog-eared.</p> <h2>You Have Ghost Mail by Terence Blacker, illustrated by Adam Stower (Macmillan, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797911\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/12/05/ghostmail.jpg\" alt=\"Ghostmail\" width=\"128\" height=\"191\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The lower end of this age group are always keen to get their hands on the really scary stuff, to be read illicitly under the covers with a torch. But the trouble with so much of the horror genre is that it is really intended for the 10-plus age range and can prove a little too scary for younger readers. And parents and teachers hate the fact that much of it is shoddily written. So Macmillan's Shock Shop range is a bit of a find - a series of really thrilling stories, spookily presented and written by top-class authors. Here, Terence Blacker, whose Ms Whizz series will be familiar to many children, has come up with a cunning and creepy story about Matthew, whose new computer appears to be possessed by a dead boy called Giles. Gripping stuff.</p> <h2>Ghostly Beasts by Joan Aiken, illustrated by Amanda Harvey (Jonathan Cape, \u00a312.99)</h2> <p>\"Short stories and poems are like mushrooms. One minute a field full of plain grass the next, a circle of glossy white globes,\" suggests Joan Aiken in the introduction to this beautiful collection of stories and poems. There are ghostly animal tales in which pets save their owners from disaster, the strange and haunting tale of the woodcarver who turns his daughter into wood, and the spine-tingling story of a village where bears were once baited and where a small child has now gone missing. What is the link? These stories are a great introduction to Aiken's work. For many children, it would be a short hop to her brilliant The Wolves of Willoughby Chase. The large type is a bonus, as are Amanda Harvey's illustrations, which capture the strange otherness of the stories.<br> </p> <h2>The Story Giant by Brian Patten, illustrated by Chris Riddell (Collins, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>In a crumbling castle in the middle of a damp English moor lives the story giant. His mind and his library are full of stories from all over the world, every story that has ever been told - except one. This last story is the one he desperately needs, for without it the Story Giant will die, his castle fall and the stories will be lost for ever. So on the night that might be his last on earth, he weaves together the dreams of four very different children from four corners of the earth and transports them to his castle to tell stories in the hope that one of these children will know the final, elusive tale. This is a wonderful variation on The Arabian Nights, in which the author tells many smaller stories within one larger one. This beautiful book gathers together 50 tales from all over the world and retells them in Patten's translucent prose, with lively illustrations by Chris Riddell. Stories from the Panchatantra rub shoulders with those from Aesop, English fairytales with African and Japanese legends. We are made to think not just about the stories themselves, but where these stories come from and why we need to tell and retell them. It's a book that can be used for many age groups: older children, from around nine, can read the whole thing themselves, but younger children could just as easily pick out a story for bedtime.</p> <h2>The Thief Lord by Cornelia Funke (The Chicken House, \u00a35.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797912\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/10/23/thieflord.jpg\" alt=\"Thief Lord\" width=\"128\" height=\"198\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When Prosper and his little brother Bo are orphaned, their horrid aunt wants to adopt the angelic younger child and exile the older one to boarding school. So the pair run away to Venice - a place their mother told them was full of wonders. So it is, but, with winter approaching, it is also full of hardships. They fall in with a teenage boy who styles himself the Thief Lord and gives the children stolen goods to sell. Butwhen the \"wicked\" aunt engages a bumbling but kindly private detective and the Thief Lord takes on a strange commission, the children's future is threatened. Funke's story is a rollicking good adventure story, with shades of Peter Pan. Warm-hearted and funny, it is almost guaranteed to be remembered for years after the last page is read.</p> <h2>Short and Scary by Louise Cooper (Oxford, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>One of the complaints of reluctant readers is that books contain too many words. They will often begin a novel and give up the struggle because the end seems such a distant goal. Not with this brilliant series, which also includes Short and Shocking by Maggie Pearson and Short and Silly by Michael Rosen. These stories are all so brief that you can see the finish when you are at the starting line. None are more than two pages long and some take up just a few lines. But every one of these 40 stories is a fully rounded tale. If you don't fancy one story, you can move on - you don't have to make a lifetime commitment, which is how slow readers often feel. These books have no pretensions to winning the Booker prize but they will get your children reading. A great stocking-filler.</p> <h2>Coraline by Neil Gaiman (Bloomsbury, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>When Coraline moves with her mother to an old house that has been divided into flats, she discovers a corridor behind a locked door. There is something lurking there that is much nastier, more dangerous and far more compulsive than Narnia. It is Coraline's other mother, a mother who, initially, is eager to love Coraline and please her with lovely food and interesting toys, unlike Coraline's real mother, who is distracted by work and leaves her lonely daughter to her own devices.<br>But it is not long before Coraline realises that there is something strange about this woman, with her gleaming black eyes, pointy teeth and a habit of eating beetles instead of sweets. Why does she want to sew buttons in place of Coraline's eyes, and who are the ghost children that Coraline finds in the cupboard?<br>Like Alice in Wonderland filtered through Stephen King, Neil Gaiman's novel is deliciously shivery in a way I would previously have thought unsuitable for children. It goes into the subconscious feelings that children harbour for their parents, taking the reader beyond fear to show that it is possible to survive the worst things imaginable. It will give a few children nightmares, but the majority will see that it taps into the darker recesses of their minds to let in a light that is truly liberating.<br> <br></p> <h2>Krazy Kow Saves the World - Well, Almost by Jeremy Strong, illus Nick Sharratt (Puffin, \u00a33.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797913\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/08/27/krazykow.jpg\" alt=\"Krazy kow\" width=\"128\" height=\"197\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There should be no qualification in the title. Krazy Kow saves the world. Definitely. Indisputably. Although, as his young creator, would-be film director Jamie Fink, discovers to his cost, life with a bovine superheroine isn't always easy and fame not necessarily all it is cracked up to be.<br>This wonderfully silly, wonderfully clever story is more than matched by Nick Sharratt's line drawings, which make Krazy Kow seem like the epitome of sanity. And when it comes to saving the world, or at least the world of reading, Jeremy Strong seems to be doing a superhuman job himself.<br>This book had to be wrested away from an eight-year-old who is normally a reluctant reader, and an 11-year-old who never has her nose out of a novel. Both thought it a scream.<br> <br></p> <h2>Buster Bayliss: Night of the Living Veg by Philip Reeve (Scholastic, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Last year, Philip Reeve made one of the most exciting of debuts with Mortal Engines, a book for teenagers that is certain to become a classic. Well, we know that he can do serious, but it seems that he can do funny just as brilliantly. You can never have too many novels with a strong appeal to boys, and this one is a winner. Buster's mother goes on a lollipop-lady training scheme, so Buster is sent to stay with gardening-mad fake aunt Pauline. Can Buster save fake aunt Pauline and the town from invasion by alien super-cabbages? You bet.<br>This is an enjoyable, laugh-out-loud romp that is silly and clever at the same time. It has a good chance of hooking even the most reluctant reader and, when it does, there is a follow-up called Buster Bayliss: The Big Freeze.</p> <h2>Daisy Chain War by Joan O'Neill (Hodder, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797914\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/07/10/daisychainwar.jpg\" alt=\"Daisy Chain War\" width=\"128\" height=\"197\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Joan O'Neill's trilogy (Hodder will be publishing parts two and three later this year) was first published in Ireland 12 years ago where it was an instant bestseller. It should be here too, judging by the enthusiasm with which my 11-year-old daughter and her friends gobbled down the first book.<br>Set in Dun Laoghaire during the second world war, it follows the fortunes of the Doyle family as seen through the sharp eyes of 10-year-old Lizzie. Her elder sister Karen marries airman Paul but happiness is short-lived when he goes missing in action.<br>This is a wonderful book about growing up and beginning to piece together and make sense of the adult world. It is beautifully written in prose that is as warm as a sunset on a hot summer's day.</p> <h2>Journey to the River Sea by Eva Ibbotson (Macmillan, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Hurrah, it's out in paperback. If ever there was a book that deserves a place on your children's bookshelf it is this fantastical, wise and wonderful adventure story set in the Brazilian jungle. Maia is 13 and has been orphaned for two years when her only relatives are finally located - living thousands of miles up the Amazon river. Maia is sent to live with them and, in true literary tradition, they turn out to be very horrid. But Maia makes friends with Finn, a mysterious English boy who is living with the Indians.<br>This book is a window on the world. It revels in a sense of adventure not only in the story of Maia but also in the way it is told, veering between humour and sadness. I read it in one sitting, and even if the house had caught fire you would have had difficulty shifting me.</p> <h2>Child X by Lee Weatherly (David Fickling, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797915\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/05/29/childx.jpg\" alt=\"child x\" width=\"128\" height=\"197\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Jules is an ordinary 13-year-old, worried about friendships, just getting interested in boys and thrilled to have been given the role of Lyra in a local amateur production of Northern Lights.<br>The only shadow on the horizon is her mum and dad, who are increasing at odds about the former's long working hours. Then Jules's dad suddenly disappears from the family home and the place is besieged by tabloid photographers. Jules's dad has discovered that Jules is not his biological daughter.<br>A story that features Jules's dad suing her mother, secret DNA tests, and hordes of hacks on the scent of a good story, just couldn't be more topical. It tackles a difficult subject with sense and sensitivity.<br> <br></p> <h2>The Worry Website by Jacqueline Wilson (Doubleday, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797916\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/05/29/worrywebsite.jpg\" alt=\"worry website\" width=\"128\" height=\"183\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The bestselling Wilson has quite a remarkable nose for what children think and feel, and the issues that concern them. She also has an accessible literary style that children love. In this series of linked short stories the two are married in perfect union.<br>The idea is deliciously simple. Mr Speed, an inspired primary teacher, has set up a worry website where his pupils can anonymously write down things that are bothering them and get advice from fellow pupils. And does the class have worries... loads of them. Holly thinks her dad is going to remarry, William thinks he is useless at everything, and Samantha misses her dad who has left home. The collection includes 12-year-old Lauren Roberts's Guardian-competition winning story. Hers is as much a delight as Wilson's. </p> <h2>Molly Moon's Incredible book of Hypnotism by Georgia Byng (Macmillan, \u00a312.99)</h2> <p>Smarter than Little Orphan Annie and possessing the newly-discovered ability to hypnotise all she meets, Molly Moon, with her cute little dog, couldn't be anything other than the heroine in a (British) children's story. Georgia Byng's debut novel takes Molly from downtrodden misery in an English orphanage to fame and fortune in New York - and into the clutches of a particularly smelly villain. All ends happily. The literary stereotyping means that it could be accused of being \"writing by numbers\". But the twists and turns of the plot and the appealing exuberance of the heroine carry the day. Like much children's writing at the moment, reality doesn't get a look-in, but nine- and 10-year-olds will be drawn to Molly and her unusual talent. Prepare yourself for a summer of swinging pendulums.</p> <h2>Time Stops for No Mouse by Michael Hoeye (Puffin, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>Watch out, Stuart Little, you have a literary rival. Hermux Tantamoq is an American watchmaker, city dweller and a singular mouse. So singular that Penguin have paid a record sum to secure the rights to the little creature's adventures, which begin when he meets the dashing Lika Perflinger - adventuress, daredevil and aviatrix. Hermux proves to be the most reluctant but persistent of heroes and an old-fashioned gentleman who is never going to get the girl even though he deserves to. This pleasurably anthropomorphic story has bags of charm, a zesty plot, and the feel of a book that was written for the author's pleasure rather than with a specific eye to the children's market. It is a rare novel that doesn't talk down or up, but is just right.</p> <h2>Mighty Fizz Chilla by Philip Radley (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797917\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/03/27/mightyfizzchilla.jpg\" alt=\"Mighty Fizz Chilla\" width=\"128\" height=\"200\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The weird thing about Philip Ridley's novels is that however weird they are - and they are gloriously skewed - they are also grounded in a down-to-earth reality. Take this one: a real leviathan of a book that includes a castle on the edge of a crumbling cliff, a blind woman decked out like a Christmas tree, a sea captain on a mythic quest, and a monster that must be fed on milky tea and custard creams. You would think that it would have to be a fantasy; in fact, it is a brilliant dissection of male teenage anger, the crisis in masculinity and why boys need dads as well as their mums. If it is wrapped up as an inviting fairy tale, written in prose so playful and graphic that you feel you can actually see the words you are reading, then all the better. This is a book that takes a little effort over the first few pages, but Ridley has never given a more convincing performance in his quest to demonstrate that stories show us how to live.</p> <h2>The Ghost Behind the Wall by Melvin Burgess (Puffin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Thrillers that are not very thrilling and ghost stories that hardly cause a tingle are too often the norm in writing for children and young people. Melvin Burgess breaks the mould with this story about a man who haunts himself. Reading it is like having a fingernail drawn very slowly down your back. David is a lonely 12-year-old, abandoned by his mother and living with his uncommunicative father. At school, he is bullied because he is small for his age. But his size allows him to gain access to the disused ventilation system in his block of flats. Soon he is playing nasty tricks on the other residents, but when he is forced to team up with the ghost of a boy who haunts the pipes and starts terrorising elderly Mr Alveston, who is in the early stages of dementia things get out of control.<br> </p> <h2>Mirrors by Wendy Cooling (Collins, \u00a35.99)</h2> <p>Like poetry, short stories tend to fall out of fashion with older children and they are often rather dully produced. But this collection is a real cracker for the 10-plus age range. And a good bridge into a world of more grown-up books. The list of authors is first-rate and so is the writing; one of the bonuses of the collection is the way it covers such a wide range of genres. My 10-year-old, for example, would never read a horror book, but was much taken with Jeremy Strong's vampire parrot story and Lesley Howarth's creepy Mirrors.com. She would think herself too old for fairy tales, but loved Berlie Doherty's The Girl of Silver Lake. There is good stuff, too, from classy writers such as Anne Fine, Melvin Burgess and Malorie Blackman.<br> </p> <h2>Up On Cloud Nine by Anne Fine (Doubleday, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335797918\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/02/14/cloudnine.jpg\" alt=\"Cloud Nine\" width=\"128\" height=\"202\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Stolly is a one-off. Even his teachers call him eccentric when they aren't calling him a liar and fantasist. Bright, funny and emotionally upfront (none of the other boys rag him when Stolly talks about how he feels), and with parents so irresponsible they behave like kids, Stolly was always so alive. But now he is lying motionless in a hospital bed after a fall - which doesn't look like an accident - from a top-floor window. Beside him sits his best friend Ian, who tells us all about Stolly, a star who shone so brightly he burned himself out. This latest novel from the Children ' s Laureate may be inspired by the phenomenon of teenage suicide, but there is nothing grim or mawkish about it: a wonderfully funny and perceptive glimpse of the inner lives of boys.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Barkbelly, by Cat Weatherill (Puffin, \u00a39.99) When a childless, elderly married couple find a beautiful egg made out of ash in a field, they take it home and rest it on their mantelpiece, only to find it hatching a few days later. Barkbelly - a wooden child - is born. Much stronger than the other children his age, he kills a playmate during a pretend bull-fighting session. Barkbelly has to run away. Little Darlings by Sam Llewellyn (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Primrose, Cassian and Daisy live with their rich father and stepmother who farm them out to a series of luckless nannies. So far, so Mary Poppins, but then Nanny Pete takes over and they end up stuck between two rival gangs of burglars. We've had this in the house for months and it has become dog-eared. You Have Ghost Mail by Terence Blacker, illustrated by Adam Stower (Macmillan, \u00a39.99) The lower end of this age group are always keen to get their hands on the really scary stuff, to be read illicitly under the covers with a torch. But the trouble with so much of the horror genre is that it is really intended for the 10-plus age range and can prove a little too scary for younger readers. And parents and teachers hate the fact that much of it is shoddily written. So Macmillan's Shock Shop range is a bit of a find - a series of really thrilling stories, spookily presented and written by top-class authors. Here, Terence Blacker, whose Ms Whizz series will be familiar to many children, has come up with a cunning and creepy story about Matthew, whose new computer appears to be possessed by a dead boy called Giles. Gripping stuff. Ghostly Beasts by Joan Aiken, illustrated by Amanda Harvey (Jonathan Cape, \u00a312.99) \"Short stories and poems are like mushrooms. One minute a field full of plain grass the next, a circle of glossy white globes,\" suggests Joan Aiken in the introduction to this beautiful collection of stories and poems. There are ghostly animal tales in which pets save their owners from disaster, the strange and haunting tale of the woodcarver who turns his daughter into wood, and the spine-tingling story of a village where bears were once baited and where a small child has now gone missing. What is the link? These stories are a great introduction to Aiken's work. For many children, it would be a short hop to her brilliant The Wolves of Willoughby Chase. The large type is a bonus, as are Amanda Harvey's illustrations, which capture the strange otherness of the stories. The Story Giant by Brian Patten, illustrated by Chris Riddell (Collins, \u00a34.99) In a crumbling castle in the middle of a damp English moor lives the story giant. His mind and his library are full of stories from all over the world, every story that has ever been told - except one. This last story is the one he desperately needs, for without it the Story Giant will die, his castle fall and the stories will be lost for ever. So on the night that might be his last on earth, he weaves together the dreams of four very different children from four corners of the earth and transports them to his castle to tell stories in the hope that one of these children will know the final, elusive tale. This is a wonderful variation on The Arabian Nights, in which the author tells many smaller stories within one larger one. This beautiful book gathers together 50 tales from all over the world and retells them in Patten's translucent prose, with lively illustrations by Chris Riddell. Stories from the Panchatantra rub shoulders with those from Aesop, English fairytales with African and Japanese legends. We are made to think not just about the stories themselves, but where these stories come from and why we need to tell and retell them. It's a book that can be used for many age groups: older children, from around nine, can read the whole thing themselves, but younger children could just as easily pick out a story for bedtime. The Thief Lord by Cornelia Funke (The Chicken House, \u00a35.99) When Prosper and his little brother Bo are orphaned, their horrid aunt wants to adopt the angelic younger child and exile the older one to boarding school. So the pair run away to Venice - a place their mother told them was full of wonders. So it is, but, with winter approaching, it is also full of hardships. They fall in with a teenage boy who styles himself the Thief Lord and gives the children stolen goods to sell. Butwhen the \"wicked\" aunt engages a bumbling but kindly private detective and the Thief Lord takes on a strange commission, the children's future is threatened. Funke's story is a rollicking good adventure story, with shades of Peter Pan. Warm-hearted and funny, it is almost guaranteed to be remembered for years after the last page is read. Short and Scary by Louise Cooper (Oxford, \u00a34.99) One of the complaints of reluctant readers is that books contain too many words. They will often begin a novel and give up the struggle because the end seems such a distant goal. Not with this brilliant series, which also includes Short and Shocking by Maggie Pearson and Short and Silly by Michael Rosen. These stories are all so brief that you can see the finish when you are at the starting line. None are more than two pages long and some take up just a few lines. But every one of these 40 stories is a fully rounded tale. If you don't fancy one story, you can move on - you don't have to make a lifetime commitment, which is how slow readers often feel. These books have no pretensions to winning the Booker prize but they will get your children reading. A great stocking-filler. Coraline by Neil Gaiman (Bloomsbury, \u00a39.99) When Coraline moves with her mother to an old house that has been divided into flats, she discovers a corridor behind a locked door. There is something lurking there that is much nastier, more dangerous and far more compulsive than Narnia. It is Coraline's other mother, a mother who, initially, is eager to love Coraline and please her with lovely food and interesting toys, unlike Coraline's real mother, who is distracted by work and leaves her lonely daughter to her own devices. But it is not long before Coraline realises that there is something strange about this woman, with her gleaming black eyes, pointy teeth and a habit of eating beetles instead of sweets. Why does she want to sew buttons in place of Coraline's eyes, and who are the ghost children that Coraline finds in the cupboard? Like Alice in Wonderland filtered through Stephen King, Neil Gaiman's novel is deliciously shivery in a way I would previously have thought unsuitable for children. It goes into the subconscious feelings that children harbour for their parents, taking the reader beyond fear to show that it is possible to survive the worst things imaginable. It will give a few children nightmares, but the majority will see that it taps into the darker recesses of their minds to let in a light that is truly liberating. Krazy Kow Saves the World - Well, Almost by Jeremy Strong, illus Nick Sharratt (Puffin, \u00a33.99) There should be no qualification in the title. Krazy Kow saves the world. Definitely. Indisputably. Although, as his young creator, would-be film director Jamie Fink, discovers to his cost, life with a bovine superheroine isn't always easy and fame not necessarily all it is cracked up to be. This wonderfully silly, wonderfully clever story is more than matched by Nick Sharratt's line drawings, which make Krazy Kow seem like the epitome of sanity. And when it comes to saving the world, or at least the world of reading, Jeremy Strong seems to be doing a superhuman job himself. This book had to be wrested away from an eight-year-old who is normally a reluctant reader, and an 11-year-old who never has her nose out of a novel. Both thought it a scream. Buster Bayliss: Night of the Living Veg by Philip Reeve (Scholastic, \u00a34.99) Last year, Philip Reeve made one of the most exciting of debuts with Mortal Engines, a book for teenagers that is certain to become a classic. Well, we know that he can do serious, but it seems that he can do funny just as brilliantly. You can never have too many novels with a strong appeal to boys, and this one is a winner. Buster's mother goes on a lollipop-lady training scheme, so Buster is sent to stay with gardening-mad fake aunt Pauline. Can Buster save fake aunt Pauline and the town from invasion by alien super-cabbages? You bet. This is an enjoyable, laugh-out-loud romp that is silly and clever at the same time. It has a good chance of hooking even the most reluctant reader and, when it does, there is a follow-up called Buster Bayliss: The Big Freeze. Daisy Chain War by Joan O'Neill (Hodder, \u00a34.99) Joan O'Neill's trilogy (Hodder will be publishing parts two and three later this year) was first published in Ireland 12 years ago where it was an instant bestseller. It should be here too, judging by the enthusiasm with which my 11-year-old daughter and her friends gobbled down the first book. Set in Dun Laoghaire during the second world war, it follows the fortunes of the Doyle family as seen through the sharp eyes of 10-year-old Lizzie. Her elder sister Karen marries airman Paul but happiness is short-lived when he goes missing in action. This is a wonderful book about growing up and beginning to piece together and make sense of the adult world. It is beautifully written in prose that is as warm as a sunset on a hot summer's day. Journey to the River Sea by Eva Ibbotson (Macmillan, \u00a34.99) Hurrah, it's out in paperback. If ever there was a book that deserves a place on your children's bookshelf it is this fantastical, wise and wonderful adventure story set in the Brazilian jungle. Maia is 13 and has been orphaned for two years when her only relatives are finally located - living thousands of miles up the Amazon river. Maia is sent to live with them and, in true literary tradition, they turn out to be very horrid. But Maia makes friends with Finn, a mysterious English boy who is living with the Indians. This book is a window on the world. It revels in a sense of adventure not only in the story of Maia but also in the way it is told, veering between humour and sadness. I read it in one sitting, and even if the house had caught fire you would have had difficulty shifting me. Child X by Lee Weatherly (David Fickling, \u00a310.99) Jules is an ordinary 13-year-old, worried about friendships, just getting interested in boys and thrilled to have been given the role of Lyra in a local amateur production of Northern Lights. The only shadow on the horizon is her mum and dad, who are increasing at odds about the former's long working hours. Then Jules's dad suddenly disappears from the family home and the place is besieged by tabloid photographers. Jules's dad has discovered that Jules is not his biological daughter. A story that features Jules's dad suing her mother, secret DNA tests, and hordes of hacks on the scent of a good story, just couldn't be more topical. It tackles a difficult subject with sense and sensitivity. The Worry Website by Jacqueline Wilson (Doubleday, \u00a310.99) The bestselling Wilson has quite a remarkable nose for what children think and feel, and the issues that concern them. She also has an accessible literary style that children love. In this series of linked short stories the two are married in perfect union. The idea is deliciously simple. Mr Speed, an inspired primary teacher, has set up a worry website where his pupils can anonymously write down things that are bothering them and get advice from fellow pupils. And does the class have worries... loads of them. Holly thinks her dad is going to remarry, William thinks he is useless at everything, and Samantha misses her dad who has left home. The collection includes 12-year-old Lauren Roberts's Guardian-competition winning story. Hers is as much a delight as Wilson's. Molly Moon's Incredible book of Hypnotism by Georgia Byng (Macmillan, \u00a312.99) Smarter than Little Orphan Annie and possessing the newly-discovered ability to hypnotise all she meets, Molly Moon, with her cute little dog, couldn't be anything other than the heroine in a (British) children's story. Georgia Byng's debut novel takes Molly from downtrodden misery in an English orphanage to fame and fortune in New York - and into the clutches of a particularly smelly villain. All ends happily. The literary stereotyping means that it could be accused of being \"writing by numbers\". But the twists and turns of the plot and the appealing exuberance of the heroine carry the day.

Prepare yourself for a summer of swinging pendulums. Time Stops for No Mouse by Michael Hoeye (Puffin, \u00a39.99) Watch out, Stuart Little, you have a literary rival. Hermux Tantamoq is an American watchmaker, city dweller and a singular mouse.

It is a rare novel that doesn't talk down or up, but is just right. Mighty Fizz Chilla by Philip Radley (Puffin, \u00a34.99) The weird thing about Philip Ridley's novels is that however weird they are - and they are gloriously skewed - they are also grounded in a down-to-earth reality. Take this one: a real leviathan of a book that includes a castle on the edge of a crumbling cliff, a blind woman decked out like a Christmas tree, a sea captain on a mythic quest, and a monster that must be fed on milky tea and custard creams. You would think that it would have to be a fantasy; in fact, it is a brilliant dissection of male teenage anger, the crisis in masculinity and why boys need dads as well as their mums. If it is wrapped up as an inviting fairy tale, written in prose so playful and graphic that you feel you can actually see the words you are reading, then all the better. This is a book that takes a little effort over the first few pages, but Ridley has never given a more convincing performance in his quest to demonstrate that stories show us how to live. The Ghost Behind the Wall by Melvin Burgess (Puffin, \u00a34.99) Thrillers that are not very thrilling and ghost stories that hardly cause a tingle are too often the norm in writing for children and young people.

Mirrors by Wendy Cooling (Collins, \u00a35.99) Like poetry, short stories tend to fall out of fashion with older children and they are often rather dully produced. But this collection is a real cracker for the 10-plus age range. And a good bridge into a world of more grown-up books.

Fourteen people were being questioned by detectives today about the abduction of the victims, who were imprisoned in a cramped two-bedroom house. Armed police freed the hostages: seven women and two men. A police spokesman said: \"The hostages were clearly shaken by their ordeal but otherwise believed to be uninjured.\" The operation to release the hostages began in the early hours of Monday when a male captive escaped and alerted a member of the public while wandering in the street. Officers from Scotland Yard's kidnap and specialist investigations unit then mounted a round-the-clock operation in a bid to find the exact address. Detective Superintendent Steve Gwilliam, who led the investigation, said: \"The operation is the culmination of a sophisticated and complex inquiry. He added: \"This is believed to be one of the largest kidnaps in the UK, that is the largest number of hostages.\" The National Criminal Intelligence Service said last month that a number of Chinese gangs were operating in London and were kidnapping illegal immigrants who they had arranged to bring into the country. The gangs then demanded money from the families of their captives back in China. The kidnappings come just weeks after 58 Chinese immigrants suffocated to death when they were illegally ferried over to England inside a fruit lorry on June 19.",

It will be Atlantis' 22nd mission and the 99th flight in Shuttle program history.</p> <p> Veteran Astronaut Terry Wilcutt (Col., USMC) leads the seven-man crew, commanding his second Shuttle flight and making his fourth trip into space. During the planned 11-day mission, Wilcutt and his crew mates will spend a week inside the ISS unloading supplies from both a double Spacehab cargo module in the rear of Atlantis' cargo bay and from a Russian Progress M-1 resupply craft docked to the aft end of the Zvezda Service Module. Zvezda, which linked up to the ISS on July 26, will serve as the early living quarters for the station and is the cornerstone of the Russian contribution to the ISS.</p> <p> The goal of the flight is to prepare Zvezda for the arrival of the first resident, or Expedition, crew later this fall and the start of a permanent human presence on the new outpost. That crew, Expedition Commander Bill Shepherd, Soyuz Commander Yuri Gidzenko and Flight Engineer Sergei Krikalev, is due to launch in a Soyuz capsule from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in late October for a four-month \"shakedown\" mission aboard the ISS.</p> <p> In addition, Dr. Ed Lu and Yuri Malenchenko (Col., Russian Air Force), both making their second flights into space, will conduct a 6\u00bd-hour space walk on the fourth day of the flight to hook up electrical, communications and telemetry cables between Zvezda and the Zarya Control Module, whose computers handed over commanding functions to the Service Module's computers in a smooth transition in late July. Lu and Malenchenko will also install a magnetometer to the exterior of Zvezda. The magnetometer will serve as a three-dimensional compass designed to minimise Zvezda propellant usage by relaying information to the module's computers regarding its orientation relative to the Earth.</p> <p> It will be the second joint U.S.-Russian space walk outside a Space Shuttle, following on the work conducted by Astronaut Scott Parazynski and Cosmonaut Vladimir Titov outside Atlantis while docked to the Mir Space Station during the STS-86 mission in October 1997. Lu, designated EV 1, will wear the space suit marked by red stripes, while Malenchenko, EV 2, will wear the pure white suit. This will be Lu's first space walk, while Malenchenko conducted a pair of space walks totalling 12 hours during his four-month stay aboard Mir in 1994. Dan Burbank (Lt. Cmdr, USCG), who is a space rookie, will serve as the space walk choreographer.</p> <p> Mission Specialist Rick Mastracchio, also a space novice, will be the prime robot arm operator for the mission, using the Canadian-built arm to move Lu and Malenchenko around the ISS as they conduct their assembly work. Mastracchio is backed up on arm operations by Pilot Scott Altman (Cmdr., USN), making his second flight into space.</p> <p> The final member of the crew is Russian Cosmonaut Dr. Boris Morukov, making his first flight into space. Morukov will be responsible for unloading supplies from the Progress vehicle during the docked phase of the flight. </p> <p> When Wilcutt guides Atlantis in for its docking with the ISS on the third day of the mission, he will find the new station a much larger facility than the one left by the STS-101 crew during its flight in May. With the addition of the Zvezda and the Progress resupply ship, the ISS will measure 143 feet in length, roughly the height of a 13-story building, and will weigh 67 tons, twice the size of the ISS back in May. The joining of Zvezda to the ISS and the arrival of the Progress provides about 8,800 cubic feet of habitable volume for Station crew members, roughly the size of a comfortable apartment. By the time the U.S. Laboratory Destiny is installed on the ISS in January, the Station will have surpassed both Skylab and Mir in total liveable space.</p> <p> On the fifth day of the flight, Atlantis' crew will enter the ISS, opening the hatch for the first time to Zvezda and to the Progress to begin unloading 1,300 pounds of goods from the Russian craft for the first resident crew, including items ranging from clothing to medical kits, personal hygiene kits, laptop computers, a colour printer, vacuum cleaners, food warmers for Zvezda's galley, trash bags and critical life support hardware, including an Elektron oxygen generation unit and a Vozdukh carbon dioxide removal unit. Elektron and Vozdukh will be unstowed from the Progress and moved into Zvezda, but will not be installed and activated until the Expedition One crew arrives on board. The first toilet for the ISS will be delivered to Zvezda on the last day of the crew's work inside the Station for installation this fall once the Expedition 1 crew is on board.</p> <p> Among the first tasks facing Atlantis' crew will be the installation of three batteries and associated electronic components in Zvezda and replacement of two of the six batteries in the Zarya module, completing the work begun by the STS-101 crew in May. Zvezda was launched from Baikonur on July 12 with five of its eight battery sets already installed. Lu and Malenchenko will be in charge of the installation work in Zvezda. Also earmarked for Zvezda is the activation of two gas masks which will serve as standard emergency equipment for ISS crews and three fire extinguishers. In addition, American-Russian power conversion units will be installed in Zvezda on this flight to route electricity from huge solar arrays which will be installed on the STS-97 mission to the Russian modules. Electrical components to charge the batteries of Soyuz or Progress vehicles visiting the ISS will be installed in Zvezda as well.</p> <p> While Morukov spends most of his time unloading supplies from the Progress, Mastracchio will be in charge of unloading 2 tons of equipment from the Spacehab module, including medical equipment for the ISS' Crew Health Care System, or CheCS, which will serve as the heart of the station's clinic for orbiting crews, and a treadmill device and bicycle ergometer which will serve as the first exercise gear for crews on board the ISS. Associated hardware for the treadmill which will prevent its use from disturbing sensitive microgravity experiments, will be installed by the crew members near the end of their stay on board.</p> <p> On the tenth day of the flight, Atlantis will undock from the ISS and Altman will conduct a flyaround of the newly expanded station to enable his crew mates to conduct photo documentation of the outpost. </p> <p> Two days later, Wilcutt will fly Atlantis to a predawn landing at the Kennedy Space Center, setting the stage a few days later for the launch of a second Russian Progress ship to the Station and a plethora of Shuttle assembly flights to turn the complex into a working research facility.</p>",

The Gypsy Council, the National Romany Rights Association and Liberty, the civil liberties group, will claim today that a ban on the fair, one of the most important events in the Gypsy calendar, is unreasonable and possibly discriminatory, saying there is no good reason why the historic event should be cancelled. Lawyers will claim that the home secretary, Jack Straw, has not taken into account all the issues involved in the case. They will also point out that the order infringes the right to freedom of assembly, which is set to be enshrined in the European convention on human rights next month. The Gypsy Council will challenge the order made under section 14a of the 1986 public order act, and will cite remarks made by Mr Straw about travellers in an interview with BBC Radio West Midlands last year, in which he said: \"Many of these so-called travellers seem to think that it is perfectly OK for them to cause mayhem in an area, to go burgling, thieving, breaking into vehicles, causing all kinds of trouble, including defecating in the doorways of firms and so on, and getting away with it. \"Travellers have traded on the sentiment, they have masqueraded as law-abiding Gypsies, when many of them are not.\" The home secretary gave his consent to allow Tonbridge Wells borough council to stop \"trespassory assembly\" on the village green over the coming weekend after the Horsmonden parish council had decided to stop the fair because it had \"grown too big\". Gypsies claim that the decision to ban the fair, which they say is more than 400 years old, is racial in nature and deprives them of their culture and heritage. On the second Sunday in September, the village green in Horsmonden becomes the site for horse trading and the selling of traditional Gypsy finery, such as china, linen and lace. The fair was used to celebrate the end of the hop-picking season, and a means of catching up with family and friends. The green has been closed for the weekend but Gypsies plan to have a parade through the village and hundreds are expected to turn up to protest against the decision. Grattan Puxon, spokesman for the Gypsy Council, said: \"Horsmonden was mentioned as early as the 12th century by horse traders and horse breeders.\" Neil Robins, chairman of Horsmonden parish council, disputes the heritage and age of the horse fair, saying: \"Historically there has always been a bone of contention between ourselves and the Romanies as to how far it goes back\". Mr Robins says the festival was for hop-pickers who came to the area from east London.

Ottey has been cleared to compete in Sydney. Boxer Jon Thaxton was recently banned for nine months after testing positive. The former Australian open champion Petr Korda was banned from playing professional tennis for two years. He was later cleared on appeal.</p> <p><b>What are some of the other banned drugs?</b><br> HGH, or human growth hormone, is the drug of choice of many world-class sprinters and swimmers. The muscle-building substance is a naturally occurring substance that is virtually undetectable.

Ottey has been cleared to compete in Sydney. Boxer Jon Thaxton was recently banned for nine months after testing positive. The former Australian open champion Petr Korda was banned from playing professional tennis for two years. He was later cleared on appeal. What are some of the other banned drugs? HGH, or human growth hormone, is the drug of choice of many world-class sprinters and swimmers. The muscle-building substance is a naturally occurring substance that is virtually undetectable. Oxyglobin, an energy-boosting protein developed to treat kidney problems in cows, helps carry oxygen in the bloodstream and is set to be the next drug designed to outwit testers.

For the benefit of other readers, Gary Crocker was a left-hand batsman and left-arm bowler who played three Tests for Zimbabwe (including their inaugural one in 1992-93, when he drove through the night to play against India after one of the original team was injured) and seven ODIs. His excellent ODI debut performance was 50 and 4 for 26 against India at Harare in Oct 1992. This was a double achieved previously only by another Zimbabwe player, Duncan Fletcher - now England's successful coach - with 69 not out and 4 for 42 in the 1983 World Cup as Zimbabwe pulled off a major surprise by beating Australia in their first officlal one-dayer. The only person to have done it on debut since is Shaun Pollock, with 66 and 4 for 34 for South Africa v England at Cape Town in 1995-96. It's not often we get a question from a genuine Test player - thanks, and good luck with the green card! </p> <p><strong>Who won the national village final at Lord's this year?</strong> asks Matt Norman </p> <p>This year's winners were Elvaston, from Derbyshire, who also won the competition in 1994. This time they beat Eversholt, from Bedfordshire, by 16 runs in the final. </p> <p><strong>You wrote recently about George Headley's 223 in a Test that was abandoned so the English team could catch the boat home. Is this highest individual score in the fourth innings of a Test?</strong> asks Gautam Borooah from Berkeley, California </p> <p>Yes, Headley's 223 for West Indies v England at Kingston in 1929-30 is the highest. There have been three other fourth-innings double-centuries: 221 by Sunil Gavaskar for India v England, The Oval, 1979; 219 by Bill Edrich for England v South Africa in the other Timeless Test, at Durban in 1938-39; and 214 not out by Gordon Greenidge for West Indies v England at Lord's in 1984. Greenidge's was the only one of the four that led to a positive result. </p> <p><strong>I would like to surprise my husband by purchasing some tickets for next year's Tests - what's the best way to go about it?</strong> asks cricket widow Kim Looker </p> <p>There are two Tests against Pakistan next year followed by five against Australia. In between the two series there is a three-way one-day tournament. Tickets aren't available yet, but they should go on sale early in the new year. The <a href=\"http://www.ecb.co.uk\">ECB website</a> has a \"ticket availability\" page which shows you how to order. </p> <p><strong>My coach is a man called Gary Steer, who played for Warwickshire and Derbyshire. Please could you tell me more about his career?</strong> asks Mark Perich </p> <p>Ian Gary Samuel Steer was born in Aston, Birmingham on August 17, 1970. He's a right-hand batsman and right-arm medium-pace bowler. He joined Warwickshire's staff in 1990, and moved to Derbyshire in 1992. He also played for Combined Universities. In all he played in seven first-class matches, and scored 299 runs at an average of 42.71, and took three wickets at 15.33. </p> <p><strong>To settle an argument, can you tell me the Leicestershire side which won the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup in 1975, in batting order?</strong> asks Andy Wilford </p> <p>The team in that Lord's final was Barry Dudleston, John Steele, Chris Balderstone, Brian Davison, Roger Tolchard, Graham Cross, Ray Illingworth (captain), Norman McVicker, Peter Booth, Graham McKenzie and Ken Higgs. Leicestershire bowled Middlesex out for 146 (Mike Smith 83, Gold Award winner McVicker 4 for 20), then scored 150 for 5 (Steele 49, Tolchard 47 not out) to win by five wickets. </p> <p><strong>When did England start to use the six-ball over instead of the eight-ball one?</strong> asks David Curtis </p> <p>The only year that the eight-ball over was used in English cricket was 1939 (it was meant to be a two-year experiment, but the 1940 season didn't happen because of the Second World War). Apart from that the six-ball over has been used here every season since 1899, the last year that five-ball overs were used. </p> <p><strong>Please could tell me who were the first twins to play together in the same Test match?</strong> asks Jean Baldwin </p> <p>A nice easy one to finish with: Australia's Waugh twins (Steve and Mark) are the ONLY twins to play together in Tests. So far they've done it 85 times, which is a record for any pair of brothers. Mark's first cap, against England in 1990-91 (he scored a hundred at Adelaide), came at Steve's expense.</p> <p>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

Following on from the nerve-jangling match between Spain and Yugoslavia in Euro 2000 it looks like being the year of the comeback. But lest we forget, here's a few other table-turners that grabbed the headlines.</p> <p><strong>No 1: 5th February 2000 - Derby 3 Sheff Wednesday 3</strong></p> <p>Wednesday, stranded like the Kursk at the bottom of the Premiership, stormed into a 2-0 lead. And although Branko Strupar managed to reduce the deficit, with a minute left Simon Donnelly broke away to make it 3-1 to Wednesday. Game over, Pride Park thought, and the Derby fans started leaving in their droves. Then the incredible happened.</p> <p>First Craig Burley pulled one back on the stroke of full time. And then - with 101 seconds of added time played - Georgi Kinkladze played the ball in to Malcolm Christie, and his shot bounced off Pavel Srnicek and Andy Hinchcliffe before trickling in. Afterwards Danny Wilson, the ever optimistic Wednesday manager insisted it was a point gained rather than two lost. \"For 98 per cent of the game we were absolutely superb,\" he claimed. \"Who knows? At the end of the season this point might prove to be a good one,\" he added. It wasn't.</p> <p><strong>No 2: 23rd October 1999 - Chelsea 2 Arsenal 3</strong></p> <p>Chelsea were 2-0 up with just 15 minutes to go. Ed de Goey hadn't conceded a goal in the league at Stamford Bridge for nearly six months, and there was little sign that he was about to change his habits. At this point most Premiership sides would have curled up and accepted the inevitable. But most Premiership sides don't have Kanu in their squad.</p> <p>After 75 minutes the Nigerian international's long toe stabbed in a shot from Marc Overmars to pull it back to 2-1, and Chelsea's defence - so strong for so long - suddenly crumbled like an over-dry fruit cake. Eight minutes later, Kanu picked up a pass from Overmars, controlled it and then whipped the ball past De Goey. Arsenal were level, but they weren't finished. As the game entered injury time, de Goey lost leave of his senses, and charged out of his goal to challenge Kanu near the corner flag. In one elegant movement, Kanu rode his tackle and whipped the ball in from an impossible angle, over the despairing heads of Marcel Desailly and Frank Leboeuf. The comeback was complete.</p> <p><strong>No 3: May 30, 1999 - Second Division playoff final, Gillingham 2 Manchester City 2</strong> </p> <p>In 1999, Manchester City were not renowned for their powers of escapology. Relegation from the First Division the previous season, only two seasons after losing their Premiership status, had made the Blue half of Manchester a laughing stock. So it was par for the course when Gillingham opened up a two goal lead in the last ten minutes of the playoff final at Wembley. Goals from Carl Asaba and future City striker Robert Taylor in the 81st and 86th minute looked to have knocked the stuffing out of Joe Royle's side. </p> <p>But then, with 15 seconds of normal time left, Kevin Horlock drove in a low shot from the edge of the box, and City heads picked up. Four minutes into injury time and they nearly exploded, when Paul Dickov took a touch to control a flick from Shaun Goater and then fired the ball past Gills keeper Vince Bartram. With no further goals in extra-time, City won out 3-1 on penalties, and their fans came up with several innovative things for United to do with their treble.</p> <p><strong>No 4: 9th September 1998 - West Ham 3 Wimbledon 4</strong> </p> <p>On a balmy, barmy early September night, West Ham calypsoed their way to a 3-0 lead within the opening 27 minutes. Ian Wright was on fire, scoring two goals, and the game looked like becoming a rout. But the Crazy Gang started to fight back (well this was in the pre-Egil Olsen era), with Marcus Gayle's looping header and then Jason Euell's drive pulling it back to 3-2. </p> <p>For a while it seemed that West Ham had steadied the ship, but 13 minutes from time Shaka Hislop and Andy Impey collided as they tried to clear a corner from Michael Hughes and the ball fell for Gayle who dabbed it home. By now the Dons smelt blood and they completed the most unlikely of results four minutes from the end when Euell's cross found substitute Efan Ekoku on the far post and he headed home.</p> <p><strong>No 5: 19th January 1997 - Port Vale 4 QPR 4</strong> </p> <p>Rangers were 4-0 down at half-time, and it should have been even worse. So the players must have expected their usually gruff manager, Stewart Houston, to hurl a few cups of tea - along with a few choice words - during the break. Instead he took the softly, softly approach. \"I said to my players at half-time, if they can score four goals in the first half then why can't you score four in the second?\" Houston admitted after the game. And his players duly obliged.</p> <p>They pulled one back through a bizarre own goal after 65 minutes, and then in a freakish last five minutes scored three times - through Andy Impey, Paul Murray and then John Spencer - to snatch the most unlikely of draws. Afterwards Vale manager Rudge said: \"I've never seen anything like that in my life. After a vintage display you come off feeling sick. It's unbelievable. We let it slip through our fingers like water through a colander.\"</p>",

In that we have been successful,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Hague today repeated his call for the dome's immediate closure. Responding to Mr Heseltine's claim that he was not fully aware of the facts when he made his first call for closure yesterday, he today argued that the government was sitting on the facts.</p> <p>\"The government won't publish the PriceWaterhouse report into the dome. They don't want anybody to have the full facts,\" he said.</p> <p>Arriving at the CBI's Global Scotland conference in Glasgow, the Tory leader coupled his demand with an accusation that the prime minister was shielding his old friend Lord Falconer, the cabinet office minister responsible for the project.</p> <p>\"I think he [Mr Blair] is protecting his old flatmate [Lord Falconer]. The only reason they are keeping it open is to save the government's face.\"</p> <p>\"It is not a success, it has become worse than a national embarrassment and it ought now to be closed,\" Mr Hague repeated. He added that the \u00a347m additional lottery funding given to the dome earlier in the week could have been donated to good causes instead.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Michael Heseltine today accused Tory leader William Hague of using the Millennium Dome's financial troubles to score \"easy political points\". The former deputy prime minister, responsible for the dome in John Major's administration, said that closing the flagging south London attraction would not make financial sense. \"The effect would be to actually put the costs onto the small business creditors and the staff,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"Now I defy anyone to stand up in their editorial columns or in the House of Commons and say that they think the millennium commission should renege on its obligations, and it should allow the creditors go hang. He continued: \"If that's what you believe, say it, but don't make easy political points that there's money to be saved in closing the Dome, because there isn't.\" Mr Heseltine acknowledged that there were many aspects of the project which could have been done better, but argued that in terms of regenerating the formerly blighted Greenwich peninsula area, it had been a considerable success. \"The overriding argument for locating the dome at Greenwich was to end those blighted years and to regenerate the site. In that we have been successful,\" he said. Mr Hague today repeated his call for the dome's immediate closure. Responding to Mr Heseltine's claim that he was not fully aware of the facts when he made his first call for closure yesterday, he today argued that the government was sitting on the facts. \"The government won't publish the PriceWaterhouse report into the dome. They don't want anybody to have the full facts,\" he said. Arriving at the CBI's Global Scotland conference in Glasgow, the Tory leader coupled his demand with an accusation that the prime minister was shielding his old friend Lord Falconer, the cabinet office minister responsible for the project. \"I think he [Mr Blair] is protecting his old flatmate [Lord Falconer]. The only reason they are keeping it open is to save the government's face.\" \"It is not a success, it has become worse than a national embarrassment and it ought now to be closed,\" Mr Hague repeated. He added that the \u00a347m additional lottery funding given to the dome earlier in the week could have been donated to good causes instead.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"#a\">Early career</a> <strong>|</strong> <a href=\"#b\">Diner</a> <strong>|</strong> <a href=\"#c\">The Baltimore movies</a> <strong>|</strong> <a href=\"#d\">Homicide</a> </p> <p><strong>Adrian Wootton:</strong> Welcome to the National Film Theatre.</p> <p><strong>Barry Levinson:</strong> Thank you very much.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> We're going to follow a very standard format. We're going to talk about Liberty Heights in a few minutes and then open up for questions from the audience. I just want to do a bit of a career rewind and talk to you about some of the other high spots of your career before Liberty Heights, and go back to near the beginning and how you actually became involved in the entertainment business. In particular, television, because I know you kind of fell into the entertainment business, it wasn't a kind of choice or career decision, you didn't go to a film school, you basically got to work for a television company and then started writing for comedy shows.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well it's kind of convoluted way of going about things. I worked at a local television station and I got a chance to direct and do all those things - worked kiddie shows, Ranger House show with the hand puppets and things like that. I finally ultimately got tired of all that and moved to Los Angeles and didn't really know what to do with myself. I got involved with an acting school and studied for a couple years. They used to have improv exercises that you would work on and you would do improvs. Craig Nelson who is an actor and is in a show called Coach in the United States. We began to do some improvisational stuff and we used to get laughs and things. I said to him \"Gee (because we were both broke) we'll play some clubs and pick up a dollar here and there.\" And so we started doing that while we were still studying. Then it occurred to me that I didn't have to do an improv to do that, I could just write it down. I never really wanted to be an actor. And that was the beginning of it, I began to write things down and eventually became a writer on a television show.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> I am right in thinking, be very interested to hear about it, you actually came over and worked on a particular British television show in the early 1970s.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yeah, Marty Feldman.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> What kind of experience was that?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yeah, well it was great. Marty was an extraordinary character. I was here for one year. It was great as an American to come over and working on the show. We wrote a lot of material, there were a lot of film pieces and also some video stuff as well. I got a chance to meet Spike Milligan, who was a recurring actor on the show - you know it was an incredible period in the early 70s.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> And then you went obviously, back to the States and carried on writing for television and you did things like the Carol Burnett show. Then you met Mel Brooks who became a kind of mentor would you say - at least in the early stage. . .?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I got a chance to work with Mel Brooks on two of his films: Silent Movie and High Anxiety. But the way it would work is that we would come to meet for breakfast in a delicatessen and we would meet and then we'd go back to the studio, then we'd have lunch. Then we'd write \"til the middle of the afternoon. And ultimately when we finished and he was filming it, I had a chance to be on the set everyday when it was being filmed and through the editing process and the scoring process. So it was like being an apprentice - going to film school - for me. I did that for two films and actually acted in High Anxiety in one crazy little scene. . . </p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> The shower scene. . . </p> <p> <strong>BL:</strong> The shower scene where I'm screaming \"Here's your paper\". It's an interesting thing how that actually happened and the reason I did it. One day we were talking the Hitchcock movies. I said I was imitating Bernard Herrmann's score in the shower scene which has the \"Heh! Heh! Heh! Heh!\" thing there. We were talking one day and we were kidding and I said we could have this scene where this guy comes in and says \"Here! Here! Here! Here's your paper\". We laughed at that and then Mel said eventually \"You have to do that scene\". So that happened. In doing the two movies I began to see things and go, \"Gee, what happens if the camera is over here, what happens if that, what happens if this is a little quicker, what happens if you do this\" and y'know everyone has there own way of working, but I began to think about how rooms should look etc and that was really the beginning of me thinking about that possibility.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Then obviously you had your directorial debut, you were writing screenplays with your then partner as well, but you made your directorial debut with Diner. Which, I think everyone was laughing at the clip, has gone down as a kind of contemporary classic. I just wondered how difficult it was to get that movie made at the time, particularly as it didn't fit a particular niche.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No it didn't. It was by accident it got made. I think MGM in the early 80s was going through all kinds of transitions etc, the cost of the movie was only going to be about $5m, and I think, because they never. . . I only know this from when I saw the dailies, they said apparently I was in Baltimore filming and they said that the guys look awfully old for high school. What they thought was it was one of those high school y'know comedies, high school kind of fool around comedy. Apparently nobody really read it, it was a cheap movie, it fit their schedule in terms of things so fine, let the guy make that high school comedy. I used to work with Mel Brooks so they figured oh it's going to be one of those really silly movies and that's how it got made. And when they saw it they were truly appalled. I say that, not joking, because they really did not want to release the movie. In the beginning, Diner opened up in two cities, St Louis and Phoenix, Arizona. And they pulled it out of release. They said, \"See it doesn't work\". By accident, Pauline Kael had seen the film and another critic from the Rolling Stone had seen it and they asked, \"Where's it playing?\" Well it was not playing anywhere. And they said \"Well, we're going to run a review of it\". MGM panicked and thought that there were going to be these major reviews and the film is not playing in the United States. And so they quickly put it in on a Friday with two days notice in New York City at this festival theatre. And it opened up to sold out business for the entire weekend. Then the following weekend it broke a house record and they still didn't think it would play anywhere and so it went city by city breaking house records. It never did play nationally, it slowly went around the country.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> But presumably because it got those reviews and also it had fabulous casting - people who went on to become very big stars obviously Micky Rourke and Ellen Barkin. It must have helped you to get the next movie made. </p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> You have a movie and it proves itself and then certain things happen. Actually I have to give a lot of credit to Robert Redford who saw the movie early on, really enjoyed it. We sat, we met a couple times, he said, \"I'd love to do a movie with you\" and I'm thinking, this is Robert Redford. You know, he's won an Academy Award, he's talking to me about directing a movie he's in. So you just think that it's Hollywood stuff or whatever. Until one time we were talking and I was mentioning an idea for movie and he said \"I don't know, it doesn't feel right for me\" and we began talking about baseball, because he's a big baseball fan, and I'm also quite a fan. We began talking about baseball, which led to The Natural. He had a version and that's what happened - we went off and did that film.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Then obviously you made a succession of films, I haven't got time to touch on all of them, I'm sure that there is going to be questions about a number of them as we open up, but you became an extremely commercially successful director in the 1980s. You won Academy Awards for things like Rain Man, you had enormous success with Good Morning Vietnam. The question I wanted to ask you, spanning those films, is about working with talent. You've talked about Robert Redford, you've now worked three times with Dustin Hoffman: Wag the Dog, Sphere and obviously Rain Man and you've worked with actors who are traditionally regarded as being difficult. Difficult stars, people who are incredibly demanding. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the process of working with those stars and what's the secret, in your terms of actually managing that?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I don't know. Some actors are supposed to be very difficult, but I've not found that to be the situation. All I try to do is create an atmosphere that seems comfortable enough, that it removes tension and everyone feels free. If they feel free then behaviour happens, small moments happen and that's what ultimately works the best for me. So they can't just do anything, but within this kind of controlled freedom is where I basically try to function really. A lot of time mistakes are very interesting - you look for the behaviour that's not the one you expect. It's the moment that you don't expect, it's the moment that in an audience that you think \"Oh, that's interesting. How did that happen. Oh, I like that\". It's those moments, those odd moments that you look for and sometimes by creating this kind of loose atmosphere you find those little moments that somehow mean a lot to an audience when they really register right.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> In terms of obviously this period, during the 1980s and early 90s and again with Liberty Heights, you've kept on returning back to Baltimore to movies which you write, direct and produce. Can you talk a little about the Baltimore films, leading us into Liberty Heights? They obviously do come from a personal wellspring apart from you coming from Baltimore and you talking about aspects of your childhood and aspects of your own autobiography kind of mixed up with fiction. I just wondered, did you ever plan that you were going to carry on making movies about Baltimore?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No, it was purely accidental. First of all, just to get Diner made would have been an achievement in that I got a chance to direct. Tin Men came about only because of a comment, and it stuck in my head when I was filming Diner, the assistant director put the extras in. When I came in, I said, \"There's too many young people to the left, we need older extras on the left\". He said \"Why?\" and I said \"Because that's where the tin men sit\". And he said \"The tin men?\" And I told him that these were the guys, they were older and they would come in at X number at this particular time at night and they would hang around and I started to tell a few stories about the tin men that we knew. So that kind of stuck in my head and then four years later or whatever it was, all of a sudden I kind of hit on an idea that I thought would be interesting and that's where Tin Men came from. But then I never thought there would be a third one until one day Avalon occurred to me. When I began to think about the head of the family, the storyteller, the rise of television which became the new storyteller, the break-up of the American family as an idea and then Avalon came. So, and then suddenly, Liberty Heights which was only based, or came about because of a review that I read of Dustin Hoffman in Sphere. The comment that I found so peculiar just kicked off this whole idea for Liberty Heights.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> The films that you write and direct, obviously there is, apart from the personal nature in them, the Baltimore City, there is quite a radical difference between those and many of your other movies. Because of the writing, actually and because of the - we heard everyone laughing at the Bonanza conversation in Tin Men or the roast beef conversation in Diner. Those conversations overlapping dialogue, the rhythm of conversation, the importance of that in these men's and women's lives seems to be at the heart of those movies.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I mean, it certainly it is a strong part. It's finding those nonsensical pieces of conversation that we all do all the time. We do all the time. When we're talking on the telephone, there are arguments with people who agree when they both think that they disagree. There are all those moments and misunderstandings that are part of the human condition and when you can find one that works, that is appropriate to what you're doing, it's interesting and it gets their attention and in many ways it helps expand character without having to have exposition. You kind of get it. The roast beef sandwich in Diner is really about the friendship. They know each other so well that you don't have to say, \"How long have you known each other?\" \"We've known each other for seven years\". We don't need that. We just know from that what this relationship is about. It's interesting to do, it's fun to do when you can. It's always the thing that upsets studio people because they're always appalled.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Why?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well, I mean, when I did Diner and they looked at the cut of the film and one of the executives said, \"You know you've got a lot to learn about editing\". And I said, \"Well, I'm sure that I do\", I said, \"As an example?\" He said, \"Well you know like that roast beef sandwich thing. He asks for the roast beef, he's not going to go on about it, he's going to ask for it, boom, cut, get on with the story.\" And I said, \"But that is the story\". I told you earlier, they're going to show Tin Men on television in the States and they have to cut it for time, they have to make it shorter. So they sent me suggested cuts that they would make. One of them was to eliminate the Bonanza piece, \"Just take that out. You don't need that\". And so it's always, I've had that all my life, \"You don't need it, you don't need it\". And ultimately if you can hold onto it, you do, because part of that is the flavour. <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson1.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a> ]</strong></p> <p>The interesting thing about movies, it's not always - y'know, you have to have structure etc and all those things, but an audience responds, in many ways, we walk away and certain things stay in our heads that are memorable. We remember Casablanca, there are a couple moments that we remember. I always think of films and when you talk to someone in the street about a movie and you say, \"What do you think of that movie?\" and they say \"I love that film\". You say, \"Really, what about the scene with the sister?\". \"Oh I thought that was terrible, hated that\". \"Well what about the song?\", \"That didn't make any sense to me, didn't like that either.\" \"Well what about the thing with the. . .\" \"Oh, was kinda fake, I hated that\". \"Well what did ya think of the movie?\" \"I loved it\". And you'd say, \"Well, why\". Certain things we respond to in a way and therefore we love a movie and conversely so, we can see a movie and didn't like it. You say, \"Well what about that?\" \"Oh, I loved that, that was very good\". \"Well what about so and so?\" \"That was terrific, the way they did that\". \"What did you think of the movie?\". \"I didn't care for it.\" \"Why?\" I don't know. It's the magic of it all that's very hard for any of us to understand. What is it that we connect to that stays with us it's hard to understand.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> I want to talk about something that it also set in Baltimore, but is radically different from your movies. Homicide, on the face of it, is not something one would automatically associate with Barry Levinson being interested in because you've never been particularly interested in things of that genre - the genre of the crime thriller, and obviously it casts a completely different light on Baltimore in terms of its depiction of its streets and depiction of the environment. What led you to create Homicide?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well it was sent to me, well because almost everything that is written in Baltimore is sent to me. And David Simon, who was a writer for the Baltimore Sun, spent one year following the homicide squad in Baltimore and he chronicled that period of time. This was sent to me as a possibility for a feature film. And I thought well, if you do a feature it will be a homicide squad and you'll have a couple of stories and I thought it would be better as a television series where you keep the episodes and just see how these people have to deal with death on a daily basis. What is that about, how does it affect them and their relationships etc - so I thought it was better served as a television show. I ultimately got a commitment from NBC and then we went off to shoot it. I directed and cast the original piece. And what I thought would be a departure, was not to follow, in a sense, a traditional cameral style, because it is not an action show, it doesn't have chases, etc, to let the camera create action by the fact that it was slightly off, there was jump cuts and things like that that created a certain kind of energy to it and being fairly ragged and crude in a way and that was its style. It caught on in the States and we had a nice seven-year run. </p> <p> <strong>Sound clips</strong><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson1.ra\">On cuts that the studio wanted to Diner</a> (53 seconds) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson2.ra\">On his childhood</a> (1min 28) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson3.ra\">On film language and editing</a> (1min 16) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson4.ra\">Life imitating art in Wag the Dog</a> (1min 41)</p>",

I think MGM in the early 80s was going through all kinds of transitions etc, the cost of the movie was only going to be about $5m, and I think, because they never. . . I only know this from when I saw the dailies, they said apparently I was in Baltimore filming and they said that the guys look awfully old for high school. What they thought was it was one of those high school y'know comedies, high school kind of fool around comedy. Apparently nobody really read it, it was a cheap movie, it fit their schedule in terms of things so fine, let the guy make that high school comedy. I used to work with Mel Brooks so they figured oh it's going to be one of those really silly movies and that's how it got made. And when they saw it they were truly appalled. I say that, not joking, because they really did not want to release the movie. In the beginning, Diner opened up in two cities, St Louis and Phoenix, Arizona. And they pulled it out of release. They said, \"See it doesn't work\". By accident, Pauline Kael had seen the film and another critic from the Rolling Stone had seen it and they asked, \"Where's it playing?\" Well it was not playing anywhere. And they said \"Well, we're going to run a review of it\". MGM panicked and thought that there were going to be these major reviews and the film is not playing in the United States. And so they quickly put it in on a Friday with two days notice in New York City at this festival theatre. And it opened up to sold out business for the entire weekend. Then the following weekend it broke a house record and they still didn't think it would play anywhere and so it went city by city breaking house records. It never did play nationally, it slowly went around the country. AW: But presumably because it got those reviews and also it had fabulous casting - people who went on to become very big stars obviously Micky Rourke and Ellen Barkin. It must have helped you to get the next movie made. BL: You have a movie and it proves itself and then certain things happen. Actually I have to give a lot of credit to Robert Redford who saw the movie early on, really enjoyed it. We sat, we met a couple times, he said, \"I'd love to do a movie with you\" and I'm thinking, this is Robert Redford. You know, he's won an Academy Award, he's talking to me about directing a movie he's in. So you just think that it's Hollywood stuff or whatever. Until one time we were talking and I was mentioning an idea for movie and he said \"I don't know, it doesn't feel right for me\" and we began talking about baseball, because he's a big baseball fan, and I'm also quite a fan. We began talking about baseball, which led to The Natural. He had a version and that's what happened - we went off and did that film. AW: Then obviously you made a succession of films, I haven't got time to touch on all of them, I'm sure that there is going to be questions about a number of them as we open up, but you became an extremely commercially successful director in the 1980s. You won Academy Awards for things like Rain Man, you had enormous success with Good Morning Vietnam. The question I wanted to ask you, spanning those films, is about working with talent. You've talked about Robert Redford, you've now worked three times with Dustin Hoffman: Wag the Dog, Sphere and obviously Rain Man and you've worked with actors who are traditionally regarded as being difficult. Difficult stars, people who are incredibly demanding. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about the process of working with those stars and what's the secret, in your terms of actually managing that? BL: I don't know. Some actors are supposed to be very difficult, but I've not found that to be the situation. All I try to do is create an atmosphere that seems comfortable enough, that it removes tension and everyone feels free. If they feel free then behaviour happens, small moments happen and that's what ultimately works the best for me. So they can't just do anything, but within this kind of controlled freedom is where I basically try to function really. A lot of time mistakes are very interesting - you look for the behaviour that's not the one you expect. It's the moment that you don't expect, it's the moment that in an audience that you think \"Oh, that's interesting. How did that happen. Oh, I like that\". It's those moments, those odd moments that you look for and sometimes by creating this kind of loose atmosphere you find those little moments that somehow mean a lot to an audience when they really register right. AW: In terms of obviously this period, during the 1980s and early 90s and again with Liberty Heights, you've kept on returning back to Baltimore to movies which you write, direct and produce. Can you talk a little about the Baltimore films, leading us into Liberty Heights? They obviously do come from a personal wellspring apart from you coming from Baltimore and you talking about aspects of your childhood and aspects of your own autobiography kind of mixed up with fiction. I just wondered, did you ever plan that you were going to carry on making movies about Baltimore? BL: No, it was purely accidental. First of all, just to get Diner made would have been an achievement in that I got a chance to direct. Tin Men came about only because of a comment, and it stuck in my head when I was filming Diner, the assistant director put the extras in. When I came in, I said, \"There's too many young people to the left, we need older extras on the left\". He said \"Why?\" and I said \"Because that's where the tin men sit\". And he said \"The tin men?\" And I told him that these were the guys, they were older and they would come in at X number at this particular time at night and they would hang around and I started to tell a few stories about the tin men that we knew. So that kind of stuck in my head and then four years later or whatever it was, all of a sudden I kind of hit on an idea that I thought would be interesting and that's where Tin Men came from. But then I never thought there would be a third one until one day Avalon occurred to me. When I began to think about the head of the family, the storyteller, the rise of television which became the new storyteller, the break-up of the American family as an idea and then Avalon came. So, and then suddenly, Liberty Heights which was only based, or came about because of a review that I read of Dustin Hoffman in Sphere. The comment that I found so peculiar just kicked off this whole idea for Liberty Heights. AW: The films that you write and direct, obviously there is, apart from the personal nature in them, the Baltimore City, there is quite a radical difference between those and many of your other movies. Because of the writing, actually and because of the - we heard everyone laughing at the Bonanza conversation in Tin Men or the roast beef conversation in Diner. Those conversations overlapping dialogue, the rhythm of conversation, the importance of that in these men's and women's lives seems to be at the heart of those movies. BL: I mean, it certainly it is a strong part. It's finding those nonsensical pieces of conversation that we all do all the time. We do all the time. When we're talking on the telephone, there are arguments with people who agree when they both think that they disagree. There are all those moments and misunderstandings that are part of the human condition and when you can find one that works, that is appropriate to what you're doing, it's interesting and it gets their attention and in many ways it helps expand character without having to have exposition. You kind of get it. The roast beef sandwich in Diner is really about the friendship. They know each other so well that you don't have to say, \"How long have you known each other?\" \"We've known each other for seven years\". We don't need that. We just know from that what this relationship is about. It's interesting to do, it's fun to do when you can. It's always the thing that upsets studio people because they're always appalled. AW: Why? BL: Well, I mean, when I did Diner and they looked at the cut of the film and one of the executives said, \"You know you've got a lot to learn about editing\". And I said, \"Well, I'm sure that I do\", I said, \"As an example?\" He said, \"Well you know like that roast beef sandwich thing. He asks for the roast beef, he's not going to go on about it, he's going to ask for it, boom, cut, get on with the story.\" And I said, \"But that is the story\". I told you earlier, they're going to show Tin Men on television in the States and they have to cut it for time, they have to make it shorter. So they sent me suggested cuts that they would make. One of them was to eliminate the Bonanza piece, \"Just take that out. You don't need that\". And so it's always, I've had that all my life, \"You don't need it, you don't need it\". And ultimately if you can hold onto it, you do, because part of that is the flavour. [ Listen to the soundclip ] The interesting thing about movies, it's not always - y'know, you have to have structure etc and all those things, but an audience responds, in many ways, we walk away and certain things stay in our heads that are memorable. We remember Casablanca, there are a couple moments that we remember. I always think of films and when you talk to someone in the street about a movie and you say, \"What do you think of that movie?\" and they say \"I love that film\". You say, \"Really, what about the scene with the sister?\". \"Oh I thought that was terrible, hated that\". \"Well what about the song?\", \"That didn't make any sense to me, didn't like that either.\" \"Well what about the thing with the. . .\" \"Oh, was kinda fake, I hated that\". \"Well what did ya think of the movie?\" \"I loved it\". And you'd say, \"Well, why\". Certain things we respond to in a way and therefore we love a movie and conversely so, we can see a movie and didn't like it. You say, \"Well what about that?\" \"Oh, I loved that, that was very good\". \"Well what about so and so?\" \"That was terrific, the way they did that\". \"What did you think of the movie?\". \"I didn't care for it.\" \"Why?\" I don't know. It's the magic of it all that's very hard for any of us to understand. What is it that we connect to that stays with us it's hard to understand. AW: I want to talk about something that it also set in Baltimore, but is radically different from your movies. Homicide, on the face of it, is not something one would automatically associate with Barry Levinson being interested in because you've never been particularly interested in things of that genre - the genre of the crime thriller, and obviously it casts a completely different light on Baltimore in terms of its depiction of its streets and depiction of the environment. What led you to create Homicide? BL: Well it was sent to me, well because almost everything that is written in Baltimore is sent to me. And David Simon, who was a writer for the Baltimore Sun, spent one year following the homicide squad in Baltimore and he chronicled that period of time. This was sent to me as a possibility for a feature film. And I thought well, if you do a feature it will be a homicide squad and you'll have a couple of stories and I thought it would be better as a television series where you keep the episodes and just see how these people have to deal with death on a daily basis. What is that about, how does it affect them and their relationships etc - so I thought it was better served as a television show. I ultimately got a commitment from NBC and then we went off to shoot it. I directed and cast the original piece. And what I thought would be a departure, was not to follow, in a sense, a traditional cameral style, because it is not an action show, it doesn't have chases, etc, to let the camera create action by the fact that it was slightly off, there was jump cuts and things like that that created a certain kind of energy to it and being fairly ragged and crude in a way and that was its style. It caught on in the States and we had a nice seven-year run.

There are famous names, and some unexpected ones too, giving their revealing choices. JK Rowling picks one about a boy who is eaten.</p> <h2>Boing! by Sean Taylor (Walker Books, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504193\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2004/08/25/boing1.jpg\" alt=\"Boing! by Sean Taylor\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>While his young son watches television, the Great Elastic Marvel, five times world trampolining champion, is practising the deadly difficult quadruple, headfirst flip.

Buoyant text, exuberant drawings.<br> </p> <h2>How to Catch a Star by Oliver Jeffers (HarperCollins, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504194\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2004/08/25/star1.jpg\" alt=\"How to Catch a Star by Oliver Jeffers\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A beautifully told, beautifully painted story about reaching for the stars. The little boy loves star-gazing so much he wants to hold a star of his own. It's a scheme made for disappointment, but after setbacks, he does succeed. Jeffers' story-telling satisfies while still leaving room for a child's own imagination to decide what actually happened.<br> </p> <h2>Is It Because? by Tony Ross (Andersen Press, \u00a39.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504195\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2004/07/28/isitbecause.jpg\" alt=\"Is It Because?\" width=\"128\" height=\"195\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The latest from the author of the I Want my Potty series is a book about bullying. The central character is a young boy who is being picked on by a certain Peregrine Ffrogg. Fortunately, he has an ally in a clever dog, whom he asks all the questions about why these horrible things are happening to him. Brightly coloured characters on pale watercolour backgrounds act out all the boy's musings about the bullyIf only the ending were true - that the bully's victim always comes out confident and on top. But still, this is a book that even the very small will understand, and all will appreciate the flights of imagining.</p> <h2>Wanda's First Day by Mark Sperring (Chicken House, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504196\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2004/07/28/wandasfirstday.jpg\" alt=\"Wanda's First Day\" width=\"128\" height=\"128\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Wanda is off to school for the first time, complete with slimy lunchbox. She wears black and rides a broomstick. When she gets to the classroom, she finds that everyone else is wearing pretty dresses and has gossamer wings. Her spells turn out differently from theirs too - larger, uglier.Wanda asks Miss Dewdrop, the teacher, whether she is in the right class, a worry further compounded when a class of witches go past with one fairy in their midst. \"Do you like it here, Wanda?\" asks Miss Dewdrop. When Wanda says yes, her teacher replies that is all that is needed to belong. Sparkly drawings for a happy story.</p> <h2>The World Came to My Place Today by Jo Redman, illustrated by Ley Honor Roberts (Eden Project, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504197\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/12/05/worldcame.jpg\" alt=\"World Came\" width=\"128\" height=\"131\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Not a novel, but a wonderfully imaginative book which shows children how their everyday environment connects with the wider world. When George's little sister gets chickenpox, he can't go out to play and wishes that the world could visit him. Grandpa points out that it already has, showing George the rice in his cereal that hails from China, the oranges in his juice that came from Spain, and the newspaper that is made out of Canadian trees. Mingling its narrative with an entertaining geography lesson, this is part activity book and part storybook. The appealing drawings are cleverly mixed, collage-style, with photo-graphs. An original, enjoyable book that performs the conjuring trick of making the world seem at once bigger and smaller than it really is.<br> </p> <h2>Moonthief by Roger McGough, illustrated by Penny Dann (Kingfisher, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>\"Look there's a new moon out tonight,\" says Bobby bear to his sweetheart Betty. \"I wonder what they did with the old one,\" replies Betty. This is a book for anyone who has ever had the same thought. It is slightly mad and whimsical, but then it is written by that master of the daft and improbable, Roger McGough. Bobby comes up with all sorts of ideas about what you could do with the moon if you crept up into the sky and stole it away when no one was looking. This \"moonthief\" reckons it would be great for housing a goldfish, for use as a Frisbee or for tenpin bowling. The saccharine ending aside, this is a thoroughly enjoyable piece of moonshine. The five-year-old I tried it on had no objections at all and loved the charming illustrations.<br> </p> <h2>Utterly Me, Clarice Bean by Lauren Child (Orchard Books, \u00a38.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504198\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/10/23/bean.jpg\" alt=\"Utterly Me, Clarice Bean\" width=\"128\" height=\"181\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Lauren Child is a star in the picture- book market and plenty of children will already know Clarice Bean, her off-the-wall heroine for the under-eights. Now Child has written a full-length story about Clarice and her obsession with detective novels, an obsession that proves useful when strange things start happening, the school homework project competition is announced and her best friend disappears. Although this longer novel is very welcome, with fewer pictures, the charm of our heroine is somewhat diminished and it is perhaps Child's misfortune to be publishing at a time when there is already a glut of books for this age group featuring ditsy Bridget Jones-style eight-year-olds. But for a few good belly laughs, Clarice Bean wins hands down every time.<br> </p> <h2>Tell Me If You Like . . . by Gerard Greverand, illus Magali Bardos (Pavillion, \u00a310.99)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-335504199\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Books/Pix/covers/2002/10/23/tellmeifyoulike.jpg\" alt=\"Tell Me If You Like\" width=\"128\" height=\"178\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This one will tickle the fancy of adults as well as kids. As is so often the case with the best children's books, it is based on a very simple idea. It takes the form of a series of questions: Tell me if you like wobbling a loose tooth with your tongue? Tell me if you like rummaging about in your nose for the biggest bogey? Tell me if you like smelling the warm, wet road after a storm? There is literally page after page in this vein, ranging from the lyrical to the downright silly and even the philosophical - with witty illustrations that amply assist in jogging the memory banks. It whisked me straight back to my own childhood thoughts, sensations and experiences, and also gripped the imagination of my seven-year-old who was inspired to start compiling her own lists of likes.<br> </p> <h2>Beware of Girls by Tony Blundell (Penguin, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>A long time ago, Tony Blundell wrote a very entertaining book called Beware of Boys. This follow-up is just as sharp and funny, and offers an enjoyable spin on the Little Red Riding Hood story for those of us who always thought that Little Red Riding Hood was nice but rather dim (fancy not knowing your granny from a wolf in drag).</p> <p>This little girl is definitely the smartest child in the forest, so when the big bad wolf reads a book about little girls and grandmas and finds that the pictures make him very hungry indeed, he is outwitted and defeated before you can say \"snack on legs\".</p> <p>Blundell's pictures are as witty as his text, and this version of the traditional tale, with its very modern heroine, will delight young readers - even boys and maybe even wolves.</p> <h2>Looking After Murphy by Jamie Rix, illustrated by John Bendall-Brunello (Hodder, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>Sally and Jim are not at all sure about their Granny Lally. Can it really be the case that the cream is sour so they shouldn't touch it, particularly when Granny Lally looks like the cat that got the cream? And would her doctor really order her to watch at least an hour of Celebrity Knitting every day? When Granny is asked to look after the children's hamster and he runs away, she learns that the truth may be painful - but is better in the long run. Trying to pass off another hamster from the pet shop doesn't work at all.</p> <p>Jamie Rix's simple story broaches the difficult subjects of lying and lost pets (both of which give parents sleepless nights) with humour and enough ambiguity to make sure that this engaging tale is always a story and never a tract.</p> <h2>Man on the Moon (a day in the life of Bob) by Simon Bartram (Templar, \u00a39.95)</h2> <p>This book is as irresistible to parents as it is to young boys. It shows great humour as it tells the story of Bob who has the job of being the man in the moon. Well, when you think about it, someone has got to do the job. So why not Bob, who when he isn't in his spacesuit for the journey to and from work wears a Fair Isle sweater and lives in a house just like you and me?</p> <p>In fact, Bob is such a down-to-earth bloke that he refuses to believe in aliens. Silly man. You and I, the readers, know aliens exist because they keep popping up on the pages, just out of Bob's view or when he's got his back turned to vacuum the moon. Anyone who liked Toy Story will fall for Bob, for Bartram's artlessly clever prose and the big, bold, wonderfully-detailed illustrations.</p> <h2>Jethro Byrde, Fairy Child by Bob Graham (Walker, \u00a310.99)</h2> <p>Most books that have anything to do with fairies bring me out in a rash. They so often seem to have been written in icing sugar. This one by Australian writer Bob Graham, who won the 2000 Smarties Gold Prize for Max is different, very different. In fact, mixed up in here with the story of the fairy travellers who Annabelle finds among the cement and weeds, is a very entertaining fable about tolerance of difference. Even the fairy folk travellers defy all stereotype. They sell hot dogs and hamburgers.</p> <p>Graham's books bubble with good humour and the knowledge that there are many ways of looking at the world provided you keep an open mind. The drawings make much of perspective and are cleverly mixed into the text, almost comic book-style, for variety.</p> <h2>The Quigleys by Simon Mason (David Fickling, \u00a310.99)</h2> <p>A proper little novel for small people, Mason's book takes the form of four interlinking stories about the Quigley family: mum (always tired), dad (a bit useless), son Will and daughter Lucy. Each chapter concentrates on one member of the family.</p> <p>The first about dad's inadequacies as a babysitter is the weakest in the collection. But the others are a giggle, providing wonderful snapshots of the chaos and joys of family life, all the ups and downs - including mum's birthday celebration and Lucy's determination to dress as a bee when a bridesmaid. Mason's prose is gently humorous, but he also gets at the often-unspoken truth of family life: that what can go wrong will go wrong, and that however much you plan, things seldom turn out as you expect.<br> </p> <h2>Lily's Purple Plastic Purse by Kevin Hanks (Hodder, \u00a34.99)</h2> <p>If you have a child starting school in September, rush out and buy this book at once. If you already have a child in infants, it will make a brilliant end-of-term present for their teacher. It has an exuberant heart that beats with sheer joy about the pleasures of school and inspirational teachers.<br>Lily loves everything about school and particularly her teacher Mr Slinger, who is her hero. But when she is given a beautiful purple plastic purse, she is so keen to show it off to the class that she gets in to trouble. Will it be the end of a beautiful relationship?</p> <p>There is one thing wrong with this book: the print is so small, it is hard for early readers to tackle alone. Otherwise, everything about it is just so perfect you will share it again and again.</p> <h2>Six Storey House by Geraldine McCaughrean (Hodder, \u00a37.99)</h2> <p>It is great to come across a novel written for this age group that feels like a proper book rather than an extension of a school-reading scheme. Constructed like a literary version of one of those cross-section books that show you the interior workings of a building, Geraldine McCaughrean's quirky story gets to the emotional heart of a big old house and, more particularly, the people who live there. Among the motley crew of engaging residents are lonely Dexi, whose single mother is always at work; Widow Shoo, who is so distracted by her washing that she hangs the baby on the line; and Mr Tring, the composer who has lost his tune. A modern fairytale where \"can't\" becomes \"can\" and the six-storey house is transformed into seven, this is a delicately written tale for children just embarking on books with chapters.</p> <h2>The Adventures of a Nose by Viviane Schwarz, illustrated by Joel Stewart (Walker, \u00a310.99)</h2> <p>This is a really original and quirky story about a nose. A nose? Yes, a nose that is looking for its place in the world, where it can \"fit in and really stick out\". The quest is a long one and requires journeys to places that are cold and tingly, hot and spicy - and visits to the library and doctor. I shall long treasure the image of the Nose lying on the psychiatrist's couch. The great thing about this is that it is more than a one-joke story and works on several different levels. On one hand it is a fable about being yourself and finding your place in the world, and on the other hand it makes the reader think about the functions of the nose. It is a very clever book - and enormous fun.</p> <h2>Claydon Was a Clingy Child by Cressida Cowell (Hodder, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>Claydon will not let go of his mother's leg. He is convinced that it is safer that way. So wherever mummy goes, Claydon goes too, even though mum is a dangerous-sports enthusiast and spends her days skateboarding, sky-diving and playing rugby. Soon Claydon's terrified teddy is pointing out that although mum is \"an excellent person in many respects she is also - and I mean this nicely - a maniac\", and that Claydon would be much safer playing on his tricycle. What teddy doesn't bank on is that a taste for death-defying feats obviously runs in the family. Perfect for the clingy child, or indeed anyone of any age who is suffering from separation anxiety, Cowell's book is a stereotype-busting, laugh-aloud delight that bursts with life and colour while offering gentle reassurance.</p> <h2>The Kiss That Missed by David Melling (Hodder, \u00a310.99)</h2> <p>You are probably right to be suspicious of any children ' s book that is aimed at the St Valentine's market, as so often these stories are really for adults who have never grown up. But it is worth making an exception for this wonderfully comic little charmer. Melling has fairytale fun with the story of a bedtime kiss that is blown by the king to his son that misses and bounces out of the window and into the night. Instead of \"follow that taxi\", it is a case of \"follow that kiss\", a job entrusted to the accident-prone loyal knight who soon finds himself in the wood where there are \"wild creatures with wild eyes, too much hair and very bad manners\". There is plenty more in this vein, and a dragon besides, but eventually it is happy ever after. Melling's illustrations are as snazzy and snappy as his prose - and it's fine to be reminded that bedtime rituals cannot be hurried.</p> <h2>All Your Own Teeth by Adrienne Geoghegan, illustrated by Cathy Gale (Bloomsbury, \u00a39.99)</h2> <p>Stuart lives in the city and is determined to be an artist. When he has painted everything the city has to offer, he sets off to the jungle in search of wild animals. He puts up a sign: \"Wanted: Hansum wild animal to sit still for painting. Must have all your own teeth and a nice big smile.\" But Stuart has never seen a wild animal before and he thinks that the elephant's trunk is ugly, the cheetah is far too spotty and the hippo looks like a chocolate pudding. Geoghegan's story, illustrated with zany comic gusto, will make both parents and children laugh out loud, not least because it has a nasty twist worthy of Roald Dahl. A very enjoyable bedtime snack and a useful reminder that it is never wise to insult a crocodile's friends.</p> <h2>Slow Loris by Alexis Deacon (Hutchinson, \u00a310.99)</h2> <p>This is a really thrilling debut from young writer-illustrator Alexis Deacon. Its originality jumps out of the covers. Slow Loris lives in the zoo and everybody, including the visitors and the other animals, thinks that he is really boring because he does everything so slowly. What they don't know is that, at night, when they are all asleep, he is really fast. When his secret gets out, soon all the animals are enjoying a wild nocturnal life. Most illustrations for the young are bright and breezy; in contrast, Deacon's drawings are dark, murky, full of detail and totally compelling. While Slow Loris going fast is a blur, all the humans in the zoo look sleepy or bored. This is off the wall and sly in a way that books for this age group aren't supposed to be.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I Hate School, by Jeanne Willis and Tony Ross (Anderson Press \u00a35.99) Honor Brown hates school, the worms the dinner ladies feed them, the smelly sand-pit, the killer sharks in the water tray. But what do you know? Come the end of year six, she is in tears at the thought of leaving. For all who are starting school this week, and for their parents who need a laugh. Buy I Hate School at the Guardian bookshop The Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish by Neil Gaiman, illustrated by Dave McKean (Bloomsbury, \u00a312.99) A bittersweet, guffaw-out-loud story from the most distinctive partnership in picture books today. Features their trademark detached parents - dad is central to the story but is so immersed in his newspaper it all just happens around him, while mum takes three pages to notice her daughter's mouth is gagged. Don't miss the afterword. Buy The Day I Swapped My Dad for Two Goldfish at the Guardian bookshop Once Upon A Poem, edited by Barry Cunningham (The Chicken House, \u00a314.99) Children's authors select their favourite poems; an A-list gathering, which only The Chicken House's editor, Barry Cunningham, could summon up with such aplomb. There are famous names, and some unexpected ones too, giving their revealing choices. JK Rowling picks one about a boy who is eaten. Boing! by Sean Taylor (Walker Books, \u00a310.99) While his young son watches television, the Great Elastic Marvel, five times world trampolining champion, is practising the deadly difficult quadruple, headfirst flip. Practising so hard he falls out of the window, and begins a series of death-defying leaps round the neighbourhood, lively exclamations as he goes. Buoyant text, exuberant drawings. How to Catch a Star by Oliver Jeffers (HarperCollins, \u00a310.99) A beautifully told, beautifully painted story about reaching for the stars. The little boy loves star-gazing so much he wants to hold a star of his own. It's a scheme made for disappointment, but after setbacks, he does succeed. Jeffers' story-telling satisfies while still leaving room for a child's own imagination to decide what actually happened. Is It Because? by Tony Ross (Andersen Press, \u00a39.99) The latest from the author of the I Want my Potty series is a book about bullying. The central character is a young boy who is being picked on by a certain Peregrine Ffrogg. Fortunately, he has an ally in a clever dog, whom he asks all the questions about why these horrible things are happening to him. Brightly coloured characters on pale watercolour backgrounds act out all the boy's musings about the bullyIf only the ending were true - that the bully's victim always comes out confident and on top. But still, this is a book that even the very small will understand, and all will appreciate the flights of imagining. Wanda's First Day by Mark Sperring (Chicken House, \u00a310.99) Wanda is off to school for the first time, complete with slimy lunchbox. She wears black and rides a broomstick. When she gets to the classroom, she finds that everyone else is wearing pretty dresses and has gossamer wings. Her spells turn out differently from theirs too - larger, uglier.Wanda asks Miss Dewdrop, the teacher, whether she is in the right class, a worry further compounded when a class of witches go past with one fairy in their midst. \"Do you like it here, Wanda?\" asks Miss Dewdrop. When Wanda says yes, her teacher replies that is all that is needed to belong. Sparkly drawings for a happy story. The World Came to My Place Today by Jo Redman, illustrated by Ley Honor Roberts (Eden Project, \u00a310.99) Not a novel, but a wonderfully imaginative book which shows children how their everyday environment connects with the wider world. When George's little sister gets chickenpox, he can't go out to play and wishes that the world could visit him. Grandpa points out that it already has, showing George the rice in his cereal that hails from China, the oranges in his juice that came from Spain, and the newspaper that is made out of Canadian trees. Mingling its narrative with an entertaining geography lesson, this is part activity book and part storybook. The appealing drawings are cleverly mixed, collage-style, with photo-graphs. An original, enjoyable book that performs the conjuring trick of making the world seem at once bigger and smaller than it really is. Moonthief by Roger McGough, illustrated by Penny Dann (Kingfisher, \u00a39.99) \"Look there's a new moon out tonight,\" says Bobby bear to his sweetheart Betty. \"I wonder what they did with the old one,\" replies Betty. This is a book for anyone who has ever had the same thought. It is slightly mad and whimsical, but then it is written by that master of the daft and improbable, Roger McGough. Bobby comes up with all sorts of ideas about what you could do with the moon if you crept up into the sky and stole it away when no one was looking. This \"moonthief\" reckons it would be great for housing a goldfish, for use as a Frisbee or for tenpin bowling. The saccharine ending aside, this is a thoroughly enjoyable piece of moonshine. The five-year-old I tried it on had no objections at all and loved the charming illustrations. Utterly Me, Clarice Bean by Lauren Child (Orchard Books, \u00a38.99) Lauren Child is a star in the picture- book market and plenty of children will already know Clarice Bean, her off-the-wall heroine for the under-eights. Now Child has written a full-length story about Clarice and her obsession with detective novels, an obsession that proves useful when strange things start happening, the school homework project competition is announced and her best friend disappears. Although this longer novel is very welcome, with fewer pictures, the charm of our heroine is somewhat diminished and it is perhaps Child's misfortune to be publishing at a time when there is already a glut of books for this age group featuring ditsy Bridget Jones-style eight-year-olds. But for a few good belly laughs, Clarice Bean wins hands down every time. Tell Me If You Like . . . by Gerard Greverand, illus Magali Bardos (Pavillion, \u00a310.99) This one will tickle the fancy of adults as well as kids. As is so often the case with the best children's books, it is based on a very simple idea. It takes the form of a series of questions: Tell me if you like wobbling a loose tooth with your tongue? Tell me if you like rummaging about in your nose for the biggest bogey? Tell me if you like smelling the warm, wet road after a storm? There is literally page after page in this vein, ranging from the lyrical to the downright silly and even the philosophical - with witty illustrations that amply assist in jogging the memory banks. It whisked me straight back to my own childhood thoughts, sensations and experiences, and also gripped the imagination of my seven-year-old who was inspired to start compiling her own lists of likes. Beware of Girls by Tony Blundell (Penguin, \u00a34.99) A long time ago, Tony Blundell wrote a very entertaining book called Beware of Boys. This follow-up is just as sharp and funny, and offers an enjoyable spin on the Little Red Riding Hood story for those of us who always thought that Little Red Riding Hood was nice but rather dim (fancy not knowing your granny from a wolf in drag). This little girl is definitely the smartest child in the forest, so when the big bad wolf reads a book about little girls and grandmas and finds that the pictures make him very hungry indeed, he is outwitted and defeated before you can say \"snack on legs\". Blundell's pictures are as witty as his text, and this version of the traditional tale, with its very modern heroine, will delight young readers - even boys and maybe even wolves. Looking After Murphy by Jamie Rix, illustrated by John Bendall-Brunello (Hodder, \u00a34.99) Sally and Jim are not at all sure about their Granny Lally. Can it really be the case that the cream is sour so they shouldn't touch it, particularly when Granny Lally looks like the cat that got the cream? And would her doctor really order her to watch at least an hour of Celebrity Knitting every day? When Granny is asked to look after the children's hamster and he runs away, she learns that the truth may be painful - but is better in the long run. Trying to pass off another hamster from the pet shop doesn't work at all. Jamie Rix's simple story broaches the difficult subjects of lying and lost pets (both of which give parents sleepless nights) with humour and enough ambiguity to make sure that this engaging tale is always a story and never a tract. Man on the Moon (a day in the life of Bob) by Simon Bartram (Templar, \u00a39.95) This book is as irresistible to parents as it is to young boys. It shows great humour as it tells the story of Bob who has the job of being the man in the moon. Well, when you think about it, someone has got to do the job. So why not Bob, who when he isn't in his spacesuit for the journey to and from work wears a Fair Isle sweater and lives in a house just like you and me? In fact, Bob is such a down-to-earth bloke that he refuses to believe in aliens. Silly man. You and I, the readers, know aliens exist because they keep popping up on the pages, just out of Bob's view or when he's got his back turned to vacuum the moon. Anyone who liked Toy Story will fall for Bob, for Bartram's artlessly clever prose and the big, bold, wonderfully-detailed illustrations. Jethro Byrde, Fairy Child by Bob Graham (Walker, \u00a310.99) Most books that have anything to do with fairies bring me out in a rash. They so often seem to have been written in icing sugar. This one by Australian writer Bob Graham, who won the 2000 Smarties Gold Prize for Max is different, very different. In fact, mixed up in here with the story of the fairy travellers who Annabelle finds among the cement and weeds, is a very entertaining fable about tolerance of difference. Even the fairy folk travellers defy all stereotype. They sell hot dogs and hamburgers. Graham's books bubble with good humour and the knowledge that there are many ways of looking at the world provided you keep an open mind. The drawings make much of perspective and are cleverly mixed into the text, almost comic book-style, for variety. The Quigleys by Simon Mason (David Fickling, \u00a310.99) A proper little novel for small people, Mason's book takes the form of four interlinking stories about the Quigley family: mum (always tired), dad (a bit useless), son Will and daughter Lucy. Each chapter concentrates on one member of the family. The first about dad's inadequacies as a babysitter is the weakest in the collection. But the others are a giggle, providing wonderful snapshots of the chaos and joys of family life, all the ups and downs - including mum's birthday celebration and Lucy's determination to dress as a bee when a bridesmaid. Mason's prose is gently humorous, but he also gets at the often-unspoken truth of family life: that what can go wrong will go wrong, and that however much you plan, things seldom turn out as you expect. Lily's Purple Plastic Purse by Kevin Hanks (Hodder, \u00a34.99) If you have a child starting school in September, rush out and buy this book at once. If you already have a child in infants, it will make a brilliant end-of-term present for their teacher. It has an exuberant heart that beats with sheer joy about the pleasures of school and inspirational teachers. Lily loves everything about school and particularly her teacher Mr Slinger, who is her hero. But when she is given a beautiful purple plastic purse, she is so keen to show it off to the class that she gets in to trouble. Will it be the end of a beautiful relationship? There is one thing wrong with this book: the print is so small, it is hard for early readers to tackle alone. Otherwise, everything about it is just so perfect you will share it again and again. Six Storey House by Geraldine McCaughrean (Hodder, \u00a37.99) It is great to come across a novel written for this age group that feels like a proper book rather than an extension of a school-reading scheme. Constructed like a literary version of one of those cross-section books that show you the interior workings of a building, Geraldine McCaughrean's quirky story gets to the emotional heart of a big old house and, more particularly, the people who live there. Among the motley crew of engaging residents are lonely Dexi, whose single mother is always at work; Widow Shoo, who is so distracted by her washing that she hangs the baby on the line; and Mr Tring, the composer who has lost his tune. A modern fairytale where \"can't\" becomes \"can\" and the six-storey house is transformed into seven, this is a delicately written tale for children just embarking on books with chapters. The Adventures of a Nose by Viviane Schwarz, illustrated by Joel Stewart (Walker, \u00a310.99) This is a really original and quirky story about a nose. A nose? Yes, a nose that is looking for its place in the world, where it can \"fit in and really stick out\". The quest is a long one and requires journeys to places that are cold and tingly, hot and spicy - and visits to the library and doctor. I shall long treasure the image of the Nose lying on the psychiatrist's couch. The great thing about this is that it is more than a one-joke story and works on several different levels. On one hand it is a fable about being yourself and finding your place in the world, and on the other hand it makes the reader think about the functions of the nose. It is a very clever book - and enormous fun. Claydon Was a Clingy Child by Cressida Cowell (Hodder, \u00a39.99) Claydon will not let go of his mother's leg. He is convinced that it is safer that way. So wherever mummy goes, Claydon goes too, even though mum is a dangerous-sports enthusiast and spends her days skateboarding, sky-diving and playing rugby. Soon Claydon's terrified teddy is pointing out that although mum is \"an excellent person in many respects she is also - and I mean this nicely - a maniac\", and that Claydon would be much safer playing on his tricycle. What teddy doesn't bank on is that a taste for death-defying feats obviously runs in the family. Perfect for the clingy child, or indeed anyone of any age who is suffering from separation anxiety, Cowell's book is a stereotype-busting, laugh-aloud delight that bursts with life and colour while offering gentle reassurance. The Kiss That Missed by David Melling (Hodder, \u00a310.99) You are probably right to be suspicious of any children ' s book that is aimed at the St Valentine's market, as so often these stories are really for adults who have never grown up. But it is worth making an exception for this wonderfully comic little charmer. Melling has fairytale fun with the story of a bedtime kiss that is blown by the king to his son that misses and bounces out of the window and into the night. Instead of \"follow that taxi\", it is a case of \"follow that kiss\", a job entrusted to the accident-prone loyal knight who soon finds himself in the wood where there are \"wild creatures with wild eyes, too much hair and very bad manners\". There is plenty more in this vein, and a dragon besides, but eventually it is happy ever after. Melling's illustrations are as snazzy and snappy as his prose - and it's fine to be reminded that bedtime rituals cannot be hurried. All Your Own Teeth by Adrienne Geoghegan, illustrated by Cathy Gale (Bloomsbury, \u00a39.99) Stuart lives in the city and is determined to be an artist. When he has painted everything the city has to offer, he sets off to the jungle in search of wild animals. He puts up a sign: \"Wanted: Hansum wild animal to sit still for painting. Must have all your own teeth and a nice big smile.\" But Stuart has never seen a wild animal before and he thinks that the elephant's trunk is ugly, the cheetah is far too spotty and the hippo looks like a chocolate pudding. Geoghegan's story, illustrated with zany comic gusto, will make both parents and children laugh out loud, not least because it has a nasty twist worthy of Roald Dahl. A very enjoyable bedtime snack and a useful reminder that it is never wise to insult a crocodile's friends. Slow Loris by Alexis Deacon (Hutchinson, \u00a310.99) This is a really thrilling debut from young writer-illustrator Alexis Deacon. Its originality jumps out of the covers. Slow Loris lives in the zoo and everybody, including the visitors and the other animals, thinks that he is really boring because he does everything so slowly. What they don't know is that, at night, when they are all asleep, he is really fast. When his secret gets out, soon all the animals are enjoying a wild nocturnal life. Most illustrations for the young are bright and breezy; in contrast, Deacon's drawings are dark, murky, full of detail and totally compelling. While Slow Loris going fast is a blur, all the humans in the zoo look sleepy or bored. This is off the wall and sly in a way that books for this age group aren't supposed to be.",

AFC Broadband, the joint-venture, will offer a wide range of entertainment, e-commerce and personalised services for Arsenal fans throughout the world. Arsenal's current website, Arsenal.co.uk, will be relaunched as Arsenal.com to cater for the global developments, and eventually screen delayed coverage of matches. Granada Media will pay Arsenal \u00a320m for a 50% stake in AFC Broadband. The broadband deal mirrors that signed between Granada and Liverpool at the start of August. The Liverpool deal, an extention of Granada's 9.9% stake taken in Liverpool last year, netted the club an additional \u00a320m and a new division, Liverpool FC Broadband. The deal coincided with the announcement that Granada Media has taken a 5% stake in Arsenal.",

Liberty Heights is effectively set a few years before Diner. Perhaps you could just expand on what you said about where that idea came from - in terms of Dustin Hoffman and the reaction to Sphere or his role in Sphere. Because it's a movie which has the wonderful kind of feel of all your Baltimore movies - but it also is very much dealing with very particular kind of political racial creed issues in a way that other Baltimore movies don't do in that same way. Did you start from that perspective about wanting to address those head on, or was there another reason that you wanted to do it?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No, it evolved, There was a comment in a review of Sphere which said that Dustin Hoffman plays a Jewish psychologist and then in parenthesis: \"OK he's not officially Jewish, but as soon as he arrives on the boat, he wants to call his family like a nice mensch\". And then it says, \"You do the math\". So I'm thinking, well if I do the math, what is the math? What math am I doing to figure out what? Is this some kind of code? It's hidden thing in the movie, that he's Jewish, but we don't want to reveal that he's Jewish? Is it a part of the plot, is that what's in the sphere? I mean, what the hell is it all about? I didn't understand it. I am sure that the person who wrote it can give me a reason that makes sense, but it didn't make any sense to me. But at the same time that I read it, and I was like, furious about it. Then I remembered, in a sense, like I was five years old, and as the movie begins, I thought the whole world was Jewish. Because everyone around me was Jewish. You go, \"Well that's the world\" because that's how little your world is. And then all of a sudden one day you realise that there are other people who are not Jewish and then you realise that almost no one in the world is Jewish. And that was the beginning and I wrote that down and I thought, the second I wrote that down, I saw the whole movie. </p> <p>In our world, when we began to get cars, we went out of our area, which was a ghetto, which we didn't know it was a ghetto until we really went out of it and then we began to go out into other areas and then finding other people in these confrontations and in the fights and the girls and all of that. And I thought, well it was interesting. And at the same time I began to think about when they integrated the schools which was in 1954, which was Brown versus the Board of Education. Which was the first time that blacks were able to attend white schools. Up until that time it had been segregated, all the way up until 1954. And I thought, well that plays into what this is about. As well, it was the year that rock'n'roll began, so to that generation of teenagers, it became the language which was sort of like, rock'n'roll was considered the rebel image etc that the teenagers embraced, and it was the beginning of the car culture. And so all these things flashed into my head very quickly and I sat down to write it. <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson2.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a> ]</strong></p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> I can't resist the temptation any longer to not talk to you about music and obviously this has a fantastic score combined with source music and also wonderful original songs from Tom Waits. Stephen Frears was here recently talking about High Fidelity and the massive arguments that he and his music supervisor and the editor and the producer all had about the songs that they were and weren't going to put on the soundtrack because they felt so passionate about it. Considering your vast interest obviously in music which is reflected in more or less in all of your movies, do you and your music supervisor, Allan [Mason], who I know has worked for you for years and years and years, do you kind of argue all the time about what you are going to put on the soundtrack? Or is it a very amicable relationship?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yeah, I mean, Allan Mason is a music supervisor I use who is from Baltimore. We knew each other from back in school and he actually started out to be a lawyer and did become a lawyer, and then in the 60s sort of dropped out of that, in the hippie period and worked for a record label for a while and he's like truly a maniac. He is like a madman. He is still single. If you go into his place, there is no house, there is just records, there's rows of records, and you say, \"Allan\", and you don't know where the hell he is. He's in there, someplace, in some aisle. He's got, I don't know how many, 30,000, 50,000, I mean I'm telling you that one of the houses he lived in, I said, \"Alan, I think you're gonna have to get someone in, I think the house is sinking. I think it's sinking into the ground\". He was living in Santa Monica. What he does is he puts on tape and then I listen to it. So he'll send me stuff, and I may listen to, out of his thousand songs or so, I'll whittle it down to the ones I think we'll use in the film and from that we'll make a decision about what will go into the album. He really is, in some ways, truly, he'll go thousands and thousands, he's got notes and things, he's very much like the Shreevy character in Diner with the record collection, which is based a little bit on Alan Mason. But that's the way it comes about. A long answer to a short question.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> But the other thing is that you have made a point even in the period movies like this one, of not just using source music. It would have been very easy for you to just fill that soundtrack completely with classic rock'n'roll Sinatra etc, but you did approach Tom Waits, and you obviously worked with Randy Newman and you got the Fine Young Cannibals in Tin Men, and I'm wondering, on one level, that seems like a very brave decision to try and combine a form of contemporary popular music in a period film with source. I just wondered what your kind of relationship with those musicians is, in terms of actually what kind of directions you give, or what kind of brief?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> It depends, y'know. Here's the Fine Young Cannibals on Tin Man for some crazy odd circumstance, I was listening to the Fine Young Cannibals in my camper and I always listened to it. I liked the energy of the Fine Young Cannibals, in some ways they reminded me of 60s, of retro 60s and I met this manager talking about music for Tin Man. Out of the blue, I said, \"I don't know, I like, like the Fine Young Cannibals\" and this is true, \"Well, y'know, I represent the Fine Young Cannibals.\" This is how odd these things are in life. I said, \"Do you think that they could do a score?\" and he said, \"Well, they are kind of eccentric etc but I do think that they have that ability, whatever\" and I said, \"Well I'd love to meet them\". They came over, they saw the movie, and then we sat. We talked and I said, \"Y'know I'd love to have songs and then whatever the songs are that we can take some of those melodies and let that play out\". So they actually did the entire thing. It's the score. Because sometimes you'll hear part of the melodies as score that come about as songs. So they did that and I thought that was great. And then I thought, well I oughta' add them playing and put them in the club. And so I came here to London and went to one of these little sound stages and we shot and put some out of focus people so it looked like they were in the club that we shot for the movie. So I was able to integrate that into the film to make it a kind of smoother transition.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> And Tom Waits?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I was up in northern California. I met him a couple times and we talked and I told him about this movie. And the burlesque aspect of it and I thought of his voice for that, and he agreed to do a few songs for the film. </p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> In terms of the look of the movie, it's a very nice print but it's a very beautifully shot movie and I was very interested to note your choice of DoP for it, Chris Doyle. He's most probably well known for his Asian movies - for working with Wong Kar Wai. I thought it was quite an unusual choice for you for using a cinematographer who hasn't made much English language material and is known as something as a kind of maverick and I just wondered what led you to that choice?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well I saw some of the films and I saw his book, because he does a lot of still photos. He's very, very talented and I didn't want the movie to be - well it's two things. I didn't want it to just be nostalgic looking, we're looking back through filters and things or some of the ways you might approach that. I wanted it to be vivid and energetic as much as I could do that and he's not afraid of colour from seeing those films, so there's at times, very strong colours in it, reds and things that jump out at you and whatever, so that it doesn't feel muted, like, y'know, remember, once upon a time in the past. So it had an energy and strong colour that is used in the film. So we met and took that chance.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Well, it's paid off. In terms of the editing of the film, you started talking about editing a bit earlier on. It's the same editor you've used for, I think, every movie. I can only think of one or two directors who've had a relationship with an editor - like Thelma Schoonmaker and Martin Scorsese, but it tends to be on bigger movies where multiple editors will come in, but you've worked with the same man for all your movies. Would you say that was the most important consistent creative relationship you've had in terms of your career?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yeah, because it's a real shorthand in that respect, and I don't really have to go \"take this take, take that take, take that moment here\", because he sort of knows what I like in that respect. And we get along well - because you spend so many hours in a little room with one person, y'know, that if you don't get along with the person, it would be an annoyance. It's not like a big room, it's like you and there he is, y'know. I feel comfortable that I can come wandering in, because I edit it at home. That somehow I will wander away and do something, or take a shower, and say, \"I've just had another idea\" without him going \"No, no no no no\". So I can mention some, sometimes what might be considered on face value, crazy ideas for editing, that he'll try. Rather than, \"I wouldn't do that, I wouldn't do it\". He'll try some of those things and sometimes they fail and they don't work but it's that experimentation that I think you need to do periodically. So he's been very collaborative in that respect. Liberty Heights goes back and forth in time in certain scenes. Someone is talking, it goes forwards, it goes backwards, I don't know if you notice or not, but it does on different levels and we've done that at different times.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> That does interest me in terms of importance, that's why I was asking you about the photography and editing because it does seem, stylistically, quite an ambitious movie, in that sense. It's not, I know you were talking in David Thomson's book about how you didn't generally believe in the obtrusiveness of film-making. But this, in a very good way, seems to be stylistically more, I wouldn't say obtrusive, but more explicit. It has a kind of sans \u00e9lan that is much more explicit than some of your other films.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I think film language continues to evolve. You know once upon a time, jumping screen direction was difficult for people to get used to. He's looking left and he has to look right, that kind of thing. We've moved past that. We've begun to understand that there's an evolution to it and it's speeds up in a way. I still believe in not trying to be a director where you're like waving a flag and saying, \"See I'm directing\". I've not been a big fan of movies where I'm starting to pay attention to all the technique. I know that's in a sense acceptable today, but I'm not comfortable with it because I want them to pay attention to the actors and the story and those other elements. I want to create the energy but I don't want to have them pay attention to the technique, and the more hidden it is for me, the better it is. Which is also reflected, you're mentioning about say the editing and this. I've never read one review in the United States to mention anything about editing or anything about juxtaposition of certain things, of music to whatever. On one hand, it's good that you didn't know that's what happened. And maybe if you watched it over and over again, you'd go, \"Oh, I see what happened\" but not for the first viewing. Because if you can watch it in the first viewing, then you can't be paying attention to the movie. It's hard to be saying that you're really caring about something and going, \"Gee, I really like the way that camera is just hanging up there and it's turning around\" and over here, \"Oh, I feel really badly for him\". <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson3.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a> ]</strong></p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> At this point we'll open it up for questions from the audience. </p> <p> <strong>Sound clips</strong><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson1.ra\">On cuts that the studio wanted to make to Diner</a> (53 seconds) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson2.ra\">On his childhood</a> (1min 28) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson3.ra\">On film language and editing</a> (1min 16) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson4.ra\">Life imitating art in Wag the Dog</a> (1min 41)</p>",

BL: Well I saw some of the films and I saw his book, because he does a lot of still photos. He's very, very talented and I didn't want the movie to be - well it's two things. I didn't want it to just be nostalgic looking, we're looking back through filters and things or some of the ways you might approach that. I wanted it to be vivid and energetic as much as I could do that and he's not afraid of colour from seeing those films, so there's at times, very strong colours in it, reds and things that jump out at you and whatever, so that it doesn't feel muted, like, y'know, remember, once upon a time in the past. So it had an energy and strong colour that is used in the film. So we met and took that chance. AW: Well, it's paid off. In terms of the editing of the film, you started talking about editing a bit earlier on. It's the same editor you've used for, I think, every movie. I can only think of one or two directors who've had a relationship with an editor - like Thelma Schoonmaker and Martin Scorsese, but it tends to be on bigger movies where multiple editors will come in, but you've worked with the same man for all your movies. Would you say that was the most important consistent creative relationship you've had in terms of your career? BL: Yeah, because it's a real shorthand in that respect, and I don't really have to go \"take this take, take that take, take that moment here\", because he sort of knows what I like in that respect. And we get along well - because you spend so many hours in a little room with one person, y'know, that if you don't get along with the person, it would be an annoyance. It's not like a big room, it's like you and there he is, y'know. I feel comfortable that I can come wandering in, because I edit it at home. That somehow I will wander away and do something, or take a shower, and say, \"I've just had another idea\" without him going \"No, no no no no\". So I can mention some, sometimes what might be considered on face value, crazy ideas for editing, that he'll try. Rather than, \"I wouldn't do that, I wouldn't do it\". He'll try some of those things and sometimes they fail and they don't work but it's that experimentation that I think you need to do periodically. So he's been very collaborative in that respect. Liberty Heights goes back and forth in time in certain scenes. Someone is talking, it goes forwards, it goes backwards, I don't know if you notice or not, but it does on different levels and we've done that at different times. AW: That does interest me in terms of importance, that's why I was asking you about the photography and editing because it does seem, stylistically, quite an ambitious movie, in that sense. It's not, I know you were talking in David Thomson's book about how you didn't generally believe in the obtrusiveness of film-making. But this, in a very good way, seems to be stylistically more, I wouldn't say obtrusive, but more explicit. It has a kind of sans \u00e9lan that is much more explicit than some of your other films. BL: I think film language continues to evolve. You know once upon a time, jumping screen direction was difficult for people to get used to. He's looking left and he has to look right, that kind of thing. We've moved past that. We've begun to understand that there's an evolution to it and it's speeds up in a way. I still believe in not trying to be a director where you're like waving a flag and saying, \"See I'm directing\". I've not been a big fan of movies where I'm starting to pay attention to all the technique. I know that's in a sense acceptable today, but I'm not comfortable with it because I want them to pay attention to the actors and the story and those other elements. I want to create the energy but I don't want to have them pay attention to the technique, and the more hidden it is for me, the better it is. Which is also reflected, you're mentioning about say the editing and this. I've never read one review in the United States to mention anything about editing or anything about juxtaposition of certain things, of music to whatever. On one hand, it's good that you didn't know that's what happened. And maybe if you watched it over and over again, you'd go, \"Oh, I see what happened\" but not for the first viewing. Because if you can watch it in the first viewing, then you can't be paying attention to the movie. It's hard to be saying that you're really caring about something and going, \"Gee, I really like the way that camera is just hanging up there and it's turning around\" and over here, \"Oh, I feel really badly for him\".

The deal, reports Press Gazette, is understood to be worth around \u00a3650,000. It is a coup for OK!, which has experienced dwindling sales of late and has been unable to match peaks of 550,000 sales for the issue carrying the Beckhams' wedding pictures. It is expected that OK! will sell on the pictures and excerpts of the interview to a national newspaper, following publication of the magazine on Saturday.",

Before a lavish party on the Seine, chief executive Jeff Bezos declared ambitions for the French site familiar to Amazon-watchers around the world: to become number one in the country for online sales of books, CDs, videos and DVDs. </p> <p>But Amazon might not find France as easy to wow as the UK or Germany, its other European beachheads. </p> <p>As well as fierce competition from three local incumbants, the American retailer will also be unable to use a key weapon in its armoury - price cutting. </p> <p>Amazon started working on its French website in secret 18 months ago. The company failed in an effort to buy an existing online bookshop, so had to build everything from scratch. \"We chose France as our third European plant,\" says Amazon.fr managing director Georges Aoun, \"because electronic sales are really taking off, with the largest growth in Europe.\" </p> <p>But other companies have bet on the same idea. \"Book sales in France are valued at 14 billion francs (\u00a31.4bn), out of which only 0.5 per cent are sold on the Internet,\" explains Sophie Rasle of a rival, <a href=\"http://www.bol.fr\" target=\"_new\">bol.fr</a>. </p> <p>\"In comparison, in the United States, 5.4 % of books are sold on the Internet. We hope the arrival of Amazon will boost the market.\" </p> <p>Indeed, all Amazon's competitors in France remain positive, counting on enlargement of the market. The leader in online book sales is fnac.com , whose bookshops also dominate the \"bricks and mortar\" market for books and CDs, with a 15 billion-franc (\u00a31.5bn) turnover. </p> <p>\"We are rather surprised that Amazon did not come earlier,\" says Jean-Christophe Hermann, fnac.com chairman. \"Isn't it risky arriving so late?\" </p> <p>In second position comes Alapage.com, a website bought by France Telecom in October 1999. Its creator, Patrice Magnard, is confident too. </p> <p>\"We have been established since 1988 when we started online sales of books with the Minitel system. We launched our website in March 1996.\" </p> <p>Far behind Fnac and Alapage comes a CD discounter, Amazon.com and bol.fr, launched in February 1999 as a joint-venture between German publishers Bertelsmann and French counterpart Havas. </p> <p>With its French website, Amazon is taking aim at a worldwide market of 160-million French speakers. But the e-tailer, which has lost 70% of its market value this year, is likely to find it as difficult to turn a profit with amazon.fr as it has elsewhere. In France, most commentators think e-commerce will not be profitable for another three to five years. </p> <p>\"Our development requires lots of investment, in terms of technology as well as logistics,\" says Amazon's Georges Aoun. \"Our advantage is being able to share these investments between several countries, as for our call centre for customers in the Netherlands.\" </p> <p>But despite its multinational approach, Amazon will still have to abide by France's block on book discounting. </p> <p>The bar exists because, in France, books are considered \"privileged vehicles of culture\", and have to be accessible to any citizen at the same price in any part of the country. </p> <p>But Aoun says discounting is not a vital part of the Amazon offering. \"One cannot say that Amazon won the American market because we offered 30% discounts,\" he claims. \"Prices don't determine the choice to buy online. Customers appreciate the large catalogue we offer as well as shopping at any time.\" </p> <p>\"E-commerce is not alone in using price competition in the United States and in Britain. This is linked to the structure of the market. Moreover, in Germany, where prices are regulated, Amazon.de is the market leader.\" </p> <p>That site was launched in October 1998, six months after Amazon bought up a small online bookshop, Telebuch.de. Most countries in the European Union regulate the price of books. Only Belgium, Finland, Ireland, Britain, Luxembourg and Sweden do not. </p> <p>To counter regulation, many readers go to Belgian websites, such as Proxis.be, which offer discounts on French books. But this importing of books is against French law, and the publishers' trade union is now suing the Belgian website. </p> <p>\"Belgium is worth it if you are here to pull it off quickly and then leave,\" says Aoun. \"But if you want to become rooted in a market, you have to play the game.\" </p> <p>\"The Belgian examples are not convincing,\" adds Jacques Mazel of publishers Fayard. \"Our position, as French publishers, is to refuse to supply them.\" </p> <p>For him, e-commerce in books is a real opportunity, even without discounts. \"It's important for us to be referenced by these websites because it makes it easier to sell older books that one can rarely find in a bookshop.\" </p> <p>Antoine Gallimard, chairman of the eponymous publishing house, also says that \"electronic technology must enable us to preserve the content of our books.\" </p> <p>But he warns: \"We have to invent new solutions to stop Amazon, Alapage or Fnac alone controlling the market. Once we are able to use the Internet to support our writers and discover others, we will have won our bet.\" </p> <p>Jean-Christophe Hermann, chairman of the online wing of giant French retailer Fnac, adds that France's restrictive laws could even be good news for Amazon, which has watched its stock plunge in recent months in the face of market worries about when it will become profitable. </p> <p>\"The economic model of the internet does not make goods cheaper than when they are sold in traditional shops,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Amazon cannot afford to be a discounter anymore.

Very much like that scene, I happened to walk in, I was dressed as a Viking and that scene took place. </p> <p>Q1: Did they let him out of the house?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No, that's what happened, no he refused to go out. He was extremely stubborn; the same thing with Frank Sinatra not getting out of the car is also my cousin Eddie as well. It is true. I mean we're ready to go a movie and I say, \"Ed, the movies going to be on\" and he says, \"Not until Sinatra finishes his song, it's not polite\". But that is him. </p> <p><strong>Q2</strong>: What was the studio's reaction to Toys, and did they interfere?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No, they didn't interfere with that film because it was so out there, there was really nothing, y'know.</p> <p>Q2: Did they understand it?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> No, but to be honest with you, most critics didn't understand it either. I probably got criticised for that film more than for any other film I've done in my life. To the point I'm going, \"What did I do?\" It was a surrealistic kind of comedy and it was peculiar and people were living in a pop-out house and it dealt with certain kind of issues and it was an odd-ball kind of film in a way, but a better example would be Rain Man. So Rain Man, for instance, they would say, \"Listen\" and here's the way they would deal with it, \"cause they didn't like the ending but they didn't say it that way and they say, \"Listen, so if you ever feel like you wanna re-shoot some things at the end, y'know, feel free to do that\". I just tell you one quick story, we did have a screening for an audience, where they fill out the cards and they say, \"What do you think of the ending?\" I'll always remember one card that said, \"What do you think of the ending?\" and the person wrote in: \"I was hoping the little guy would snap out of it.'</p> <p><strong>Q3:</strong> The ending of The Natural had a certain tacked on feeling. Was that intentional?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yes it was, because it was a fable, because of the way the movie progressed it seemed like a logical conclusion. It's an interesting thing because y'know, Bernard Malamud who wrote it had a different ending. It was a much darker ending. We talked about the difference between the book and the film. The film goes a different way than [novelist] Malamud went. On the other hand, I don't think we could have gotten away with Malamud's ending which was he strikes out and he's accused of throwing the game and it ends with \"Say it ain't so Joe, say it ain't so\". It's sort of something where we wouldn't get away with either. And probably it becomes one of the screenwriter going his direction which was into this kind of, I guess, sort of, full fantasy type of work that seemed consistent to that, in my mind. At one time we almost thought that we would just have him swing and it would go, \"Strike three\" and the to black, and that would be the ending. Just to see what the reaction of the studio would have been, which would probably have been to pass out. That Robert Redford strikes out at the end and it just goes to black. . . it seemed consistent to what we were doing.</p> <p><strong>Q4:</strong> Why did you part company after something like 12 years of working with Mark Johnson as your producer?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well, I think because Mark wanted to do a number of films at that point and I was doing certain things. There comes a point because we started out together, that we have different kinds of ambitions. He wanted to pursue other pieces and so at that point in time it seemed the right thing to do. He's gone on to do other things and I've obviously done other things. Although we've just worked this past year on a piece called An Everlasting Piece, which I shot in Ireland. It was a very small movie and it takes place in Belfast in the 80s. It was written by someone who grew up in Belfast and it's a comedy that deals with a couple of wig salesmen. They sell hairpieces. One's Catholic and one's Protestant and they kind of deal with one another set against the backdrop of the 80s in Belfast. So we worked on that one together, y'know, so we still obviously stay in contact.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Do you enjoy being a producer yourself? Because obviously that's something that you've become, I mean apart from your own movies with Baltimore Pictures and now Baltimore Spring Creek Pictures, you've got a kind of roster of productions which aren't necessarily yours.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well there's two different things to it. I mean, one, there are some films that are personal to me that I want to do; there are other ideas that come along and I say, \"I'd like to see that\" and if I can help to facilitate that in some fashion then I would love to do that. So y'know, Analyse This, this past year was out of our company and Perfect Storm was out of our company and Quiz Show was out of our company and some things I'm probably forgetting. Some things are just nice, you say, \"I'd like to see that happen\" and then there are those that I feel more emotionally connected to.</p> <p><strong>Q5:</strong> I want to ask about An Everlasting Piece - why did you get involved with something that seems to be out of the normal course of your film-making, your milieu?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well Mark Johnson gave me the script and I thought it was interesting and he said, \"What about directing?\" I said, \"I don't know, I'm not sure that maybe it shouldn't be an Irish director who does it\" But I said, \"I'll tell you what I'll do, why don't we get some Irish actors together and have a reading of the script and I'll see if what I think is humorous and where I think things work, work. Then if I feel comfortable enough, then I'll do that.\" And we had a reading of it and I thought all the things that were humorous and where the drama was actually, I was very comfortable with and so I agreed to do it. When I went to Belfast, I was sort of surprised because it reminds me of Baltimore! It has the row houses, it's very similar in parts to Baltimore. I was sort of shocked by it, I thought I was doing sort of the Belfast version of Tin Man. It has aspects of that, of course there is the political climate, which we don't really focus on, we really deal with the relationship of these two guys trying to sell hairpieces. It's always the odd man out because if they're in a Catholic neighbourhood then the Protestant is out, or vice versa. And it was an interesting piece because you can deal with those issues without dealing with them head-on and dealing with the comedy which is not the comedy about the troubles, it is really about the relationship between these two guys in what I might consider a much more of a human comedy, and so that's how it happened.</p> <p><strong>Q6:</strong> Do you use self-destructive characters in your personal movies, to ensure the films - because they are based in your memory - don't become too sentimental and soppy?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well I don't think I consciously do any one thing, I think it just becomes, when you lay it out in your head, you go down the road that seems to make sense to you, rather than saying I think I need to do this because it will counter-balance this, etc etc. I think any time you deal with certain things that take place in the past you always struggle with, especially if you're not really action-oriented and you're character-oriented, you're always going to have to deal with the aspects of what is going to be a clich\u00e9 from what we know versus what happened. But I don't try to consciously do any one thing to counter-balance what I think, y'know, someone may think or feel. I have to kind of just rely on my own instincts.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> I just wanted to ask you one supplementary question which is about the burlesque aspect of Liberty Heights. What made you make that such an important focus of the action - and also not just as a setting where people meet and talk, it's almost like a commentary as we go through the film, you cut to burlesque dancers throughout the film, what is the kind of importance of burlesque in Liberty Heights?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Well it's part of the transition as well because it's the end of that. A lot of the other things are all at the beginning and that's really the end of that. It was also the end of, in a sense, the ultimate irony that the numbers racket which ended was taken over by the government and that became the big lotteries that we had and a lot of those people were arrested - the government took for being \"Well that's a good idea, we'll do it instead\". I thought the setting of things that are ending and things that are beginning and also my father, a lot of his friends had been involved on the block where they had the clubs etc and they always had sort of shady kind of, y'know, things that went on. It wasn't like Mafioso stuff, but there were these questionable things. Like a mother says at one point, \"Because it's illegal, but it's not so bad\". I thought y'know, it is a true story, about the guy hitting the money, but would have busted them. In the context of it all, I thought it was the right texture for it.</p> <p><strong>Q7:</strong> Why did you set the black young girl in the school [in Liberty Heights]. I ask this because I grew up in Baltimore, and I just don't think that she is credible.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> First of all, it was real. Actually I am surprised that you would ask that question, because there were, in my year, three blacks. All of them were middle class. Because Forest Park was a middle class section, the middle class blacks went to the middle class school. Rather than the poor blacks who would still be down at Dunbar etc and that part of town. And it wasn't until bussing began to move people from one neighbourhood to another. But at that point in time, it would definitely be a middle class black individual that would be going to Forest Park.</p> <p>Q7: You have it set in '54?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yes, in '54, the beginning of the desegregation of the school system. I actually took a real situation and she actually, her father was a doctor. So I just took the thing that I knew about.</p> <p><strong>Q8:</strong> How do you feel about the lack of depiction of Jewish culture in British television and film?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I don't know enough about the situation here to really comment on it because I'm not familiar with the shows on television because we wouldn't have seen them in the States, so I really don't know enough to give you a good answer.</p> <p><strong>Q9:</strong> Why did you do Disclosure?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I thought it was interesting to me to deal with the issue of sexual harassment because it became like, the corporation's paranoia of the 80s versus what the corporation's stories in the past might have been in terms of take-overs and whatever, power plays and all that kind of stuff. What I was intrigued by was the politics of that, and I was also intrigued by whether or not you can create suspense, hold the audience together, for two hours and try to get them involved in terms of the tension of it, when in the end, no one has a gun and no one is going to shoot anybody, in the end the guy could lose his job. Just that. But yet you create a world of certain suspense and intrigue and there is no gun, there is no one coming to kill you. So I like that idea of dealing with suspense and using the sexual harassment issue to kind of play that out. So that it becomes all these glass walls, it seems so friendly and becomes a point of paranoia. That intrigued me on that respect.</p> <p><strong>Q10:</strong> Was Tom Cruise your original choice in Rain Man?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I came into the film late. Dustin and Tom had both been signed to do the movie and four directors had been involved and all of them dropped out. Finally I had a conversation with Dustin Hoffman, who talked to me about it and he was explaining the story and I said, \"Oh that's interesting, I don't see what the big problem is\". Sydney Pollack was the last director to drop out because he couldn't figure out how to handle the story. So I came late into the process and so I took over and my big thing was to throw out all the story stuff they had. Let's just simplify it. We've got two guys in a car. I'll tell you this, because every director approaches things in a different way. Sydney Pollack said to me, and for him, ultimately, it probably wasn't the right film to do. He said, \"I don't want to do a movie about two schmucks in a car\" and I said, \"Sydney, I think that it's a good idea\" and ultimately I took out the adventure aspects of it and let's just focus on these two things. The salesman who can sell and can charm, with this individual who can't be sold, who can't be charmed and who you can't really communicate with. At some point it's going to turn back on yourself and you're gonna have to deal with yourself because there is no one else to deal with. And so that's what happened. When we went on the road to shoot it, we just kept finding other things and trying other things as we went along. So a lot of it became improvisation along the road. And to not focus on the issues of autism, because it's not a disease that can be corrected, and yet at the same time, let's not be afraid of humour, because it's also a part of it. And when I spoke to families of autistic children they could tell you stories because it's part of like, almost a pressure release. Because they have to be able to talk about it with some kind of humour, otherwise it's just so difficult for them. But not to be afraid of that as a texture to the film. So long answer to that, they were already there when I came on.</p> <p><strong>Q11:</strong> What was this thing you've got with Cadillacs?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> In many ways because it's the American dream and in these films it is part of that. You go to see the Cadillac and the American dream is there. But all is not well in America, and so in the course of the year of this film, going from rushes. . . that's the changeover from the '55 to the '56 model and the '54 to the '55.. the '56 comes out in '55 and the '55 comes out in '54 - that's the way it works - but that's the dream. So life goes on and the dream is still the American dream and yet we haven't attained that and we still struggle with things. In Tin Men, it was because every Tin Man wanted the Cadillac because that meant they were a success. So it has always been the symbol of success in America, so that I've always used it in one way or another.</p> <p>Q11: Do you have one?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> My father had one, as soon as we moved to suburbia and we had enough money, he got that Cadillac. </p> <p><strong>Q12:</strong> Would you like to make a film about the film business?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> I don't know, it would depend on what the . . . I mean I've done it in a peripheral way. . .</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> Well, isn't Wag the Dog really a kind of a film about the movie business?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Yes and how politics is the movie business, yes. I mean, so the movie business has crept into everything and certainly politics because it is a show. They need to do very much the same kind of way - they've taken more and more film techniques, in fact some of the candidates even work with directors about how to speak to an audience and what's the most effective way to do that, and so, yeah it does link up. The closest I came to it was this film called Jimmy Hollywood, which I don't really know if it was shown over here. Which was Joe Pesci and it was a really kind of modern Hollywood, which was run-down and derelict, and you have a guy who is really not mentally stable in many ways who dreams and aspires to be an actor, and because of circumstance where people think he is some kind of vigilante, he begins to play out a role and begins to think of himself in those terms. But not the film business, the inner workings of it, no.</p> <p><strong>Q13:</strong> What was your continuing creative involvement with Homicide after you'd actually directed the first episode and green-lit it?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> In terms of scripts, stories that we're going to do, I'd look at rough cuts, make suggestions.</p> <p><strong>Q14:</strong> When are we going to see the last of the series - when are Channel Four going to show them?</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> We've been talking about that tonight, whether the National Film Theatre - if we can't get it on British television - whether we can get the episodes that haven't been screened in the UK. Here, as you can tell, there is a lot of enthusiasm for that, Barry.</p> <p><strong>Q15:</strong> When you shot Wag the Dog, you shot it quickly. Was it strange to sit back and see life imitating art?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Both things, I mean we shot it very fast, we shot it in 29 days, we were supposed to shoot it in 30 but we started going so fast that we couldn't stop, y'know. And we had to do it very quickly and we did it very inexpensively, even though we had big movie stars. And then of course, obviously when events began to be close to what happened in Wag the Dog, it was shocking. To have the fact that we had a girl scout and Monica Lewinsky and they both wore berets, I mean it was. And there was a sexual act that happened in the White House and then ultimately, the bombing raid that took place, it was almost surrealistic how close it was. The ultimate irony of it, in one way and sometimes it's a little bit like, y'know you go, \"Good\". There was phenomenal reviews, except in Washington DC, and secondly the critic took us to task by saying: \"It's a stupid title for a movie, y'know, Wag the Dog\" and suddenly to turn around within six weeks to have Kissinger saying on the news \"This is not a Wag the Dog scenario\". Wag the Dog became a part of the language. And also to take task that we didn't know enough about politics because these things cannot occur and etc etc. All of these things started to occur, so I got a private joy out of that. But it is odd when you do something and how similar things are, that can happen in life. I was pretty shocked. <strong>[ <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson4.ra\">Listen to the soundclip</a> ]</strong></p> <p><strong>Q16:</strong> I just wanted to say that Liberty Heights is wonderful - are we going to have anymore Baltimore movies?</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> That's a hard question. One, I don't know if, I mean I have certain ideas and I also think it gets more difficult to do those, it gets more and more difficult to do kind of smaller, not that it's small, because it's actually fairly difficult to do those, there is over 5,000 extras and we're all over the city. Most of the things that you see don't quite exist like that. The street with all of the clubs, that doesn't exist and a lot of things had to be faked for the film. But it gets harder to do films about people. Not extraordinary people, just people. And it's harder to sell them and the marketplace gets more, kind of big event, ride films - when you read a review it's a \"real ride\". I'm still of the mind that if it's a ride, you get on the thing and you go for a ride but that the ride in a theatre has to deal with people, it has to deal with character and some of the things that I can relate to. And not that there isn't room for the some of the other things, but that you'd like to have the blend but it is getting more and more squeezed out of the market place. I mean I don't know a James Bond. That's not something I relate to on a normal basis. I can enjoy one of those movies, but I don't know a James Bond. I also like to see the things that I sort of know about, that happen in the society that we live in and the world we live in today. But it gets more and more difficult all of the time. </p> <p><strong>Q17:</strong> What the process you follow when it's not a script that you've originated, what kind of input do you have? Do you rewrite? I know in Levinson on Levinson, you talked about working with James Herbert, perhaps you could just generally talk about working with other script writers.</p> <p><strong>BL:</strong> Ultimately I have to be comfortable enough with the material and with the dialogue and everything else. Sometimes I will change dialogue or work with an actor and fix things if it doesn't sound right to my ear, so you modify and change things, even on scripts that you're not considered a writer. Scenes, etc, a number of things that take place. But certainly in terms of dialogue, it has to feel comfortable enough to my ear because if it doesn't, then I keep thinking something's wrong. Sometimes it's not the performance, the dialogue sticks out as something isn't natural enough for me.</p> <p><strong>AW:</strong> At that point we have to stop, I'm afraid but we have got a lovely clip of Rain Man for you to end this evening. I'd like to thank the Guardian, Warner Brothers. Barry Levinson for giving us a wonderful new movie, Liberty Heights. I'd like most of all to thank Barry Levinson himself for being our guest this evening. </p> <p> <strong>Sound clips</strong><br> \u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson1.ra\">On cuts that the studio wanted to make to Diner</a> (53 seconds) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson2.ra\">On his childhood</a> (1min 28) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson3.ra\">On film language and editing</a> (1min 16) <br>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/film/levinson/0913levinson4.ra\">Life imitating art in Wag the Dog</a> (1min 41)</p>",

And it was an interesting piece because you can deal with those issues without dealing with them head-on and dealing with the comedy which is not the comedy about the troubles, it is really about the relationship between these two guys in what I might consider a much more of a human comedy, and so that's how it happened. Q6: Do you use self-destructive characters in your personal movies, to ensure the films - because they are based in your memory - don't become too sentimental and soppy? BL: Well I don't think I consciously do any one thing, I think it just becomes, when you lay it out in your head, you go down the road that seems to make sense to you, rather than saying I think I need to do this because it will counter-balance this, etc etc. I think any time you deal with certain things that take place in the past you always struggle with, especially if you're not really action-oriented and you're character-oriented, you're always going to have to deal with the aspects of what is going to be a clich\u00e9 from what we know versus what happened. But I don't try to consciously do any one thing to counter-balance what I think, y'know, someone may think or feel. I have to kind of just rely on my own instincts. AW: I just wanted to ask you one supplementary question which is about the burlesque aspect of Liberty Heights. What made you make that such an important focus of the action - and also not just as a setting where people meet and talk, it's almost like a commentary as we go through the film, you cut to burlesque dancers throughout the film, what is the kind of importance of burlesque in Liberty Heights? BL: Well it's part of the transition as well because it's the end of that. A lot of the other things are all at the beginning and that's really the end of that. It was also the end of, in a sense, the ultimate irony that the numbers racket which ended was taken over by the government and that became the big lotteries that we had and a lot of those people were arrested - the government took for being \"Well that's a good idea, we'll do it instead\". I thought the setting of things that are ending and things that are beginning and also my father, a lot of his friends had been involved on the block where they had the clubs etc and they always had sort of shady kind of, y'know, things that went on. It wasn't like Mafioso stuff, but there were these questionable things. Like a mother says at one point, \"Because it's illegal, but it's not so bad\". I thought y'know, it is a true story, about the guy hitting the money, but would have busted them. In the context of it all, I thought it was the right texture for it. Q7: Why did you set the black young girl in the school [in Liberty Heights]. I ask this because I grew up in Baltimore, and I just don't think that she is credible. BL: First of all, it was real. Actually I am surprised that you would ask that question, because there were, in my year, three blacks. All of them were middle class. Because Forest Park was a middle class section, the middle class blacks went to the middle class school. Rather than the poor blacks who would still be down at Dunbar etc and that part of town. And it wasn't until bussing began to move people from one neighbourhood to another. But at that point in time, it would definitely be a middle class black individual that would be going to Forest Park. Q7: You have it set in '54? BL: Yes, in '54, the beginning of the desegregation of the school system. I actually took a real situation and she actually, her father was a doctor. So I just took the thing that I knew about. Q8: How do you feel about the lack of depiction of Jewish culture in British television and film? BL: I don't know enough about the situation here to really comment on it because I'm not familiar with the shows on television because we wouldn't have seen them in the States, so I really don't know enough to give you a good answer. Q9: Why did you do Disclosure? BL: I thought it was interesting to me to deal with the issue of sexual harassment because it became like, the corporation's paranoia of the 80s versus what the corporation's stories in the past might have been in terms of take-overs and whatever, power plays and all that kind of stuff. What I was intrigued by was the politics of that, and I was also intrigued by whether or not you can create suspense, hold the audience together, for two hours and try to get them involved in terms of the tension of it, when in the end, no one has a gun and no one is going to shoot anybody, in the end the guy could lose his job. Just that. But yet you create a world of certain suspense and intrigue and there is no gun, there is no one coming to kill you. So I like that idea of dealing with suspense and using the sexual harassment issue to kind of play that out. So that it becomes all these glass walls, it seems so friendly and becomes a point of paranoia. That intrigued me on that respect. Q10: Was Tom Cruise your original choice in Rain Man? BL: I came into the film late. Dustin and Tom had both been signed to do the movie and four directors had been involved and all of them dropped out. Finally I had a conversation with Dustin Hoffman, who talked to me about it and he was explaining the story and I said, \"Oh that's interesting, I don't see what the big problem is\". Sydney Pollack was the last director to drop out because he couldn't figure out how to handle the story. So I came late into the process and so I took over and my big thing was to throw out all the story stuff they had. Let's just simplify it. We've got two guys in a car. I'll tell you this, because every director approaches things in a different way. Sydney Pollack said to me, and for him, ultimately, it probably wasn't the right film to do. He said, \"I don't want to do a movie about two schmucks in a car\" and I said, \"Sydney, I think that it's a good idea\" and ultimately I took out the adventure aspects of it and let's just focus on these two things. The salesman who can sell and can charm, with this individual who can't be sold, who can't be charmed and who you can't really communicate with. At some point it's going to turn back on yourself and you're gonna have to deal with yourself because there is no one else to deal with. And so that's what happened. When we went on the road to shoot it, we just kept finding other things and trying other things as we went along. So a lot of it became improvisation along the road. And to not focus on the issues of autism, because it's not a disease that can be corrected, and yet at the same time, let's not be afraid of humour, because it's also a part of it. And when I spoke to families of autistic children they could tell you stories because it's part of like, almost a pressure release. Because they have to be able to talk about it with some kind of humour, otherwise it's just so difficult for them. But not to be afraid of that as a texture to the film. So long answer to that, they were already there when I came on. Q11: What was this thing you've got with Cadillacs? BL: In many ways because it's the American dream and in these films it is part of that. You go to see the Cadillac and the American dream is there. But all is not well in America, and so in the course of the year of this film, going from rushes. . . that's the changeover from the '55 to the '56 model and the '54 to the '55.. the '56 comes out in '55 and the '55 comes out in '54 - that's the way it works - but that's the dream. So life goes on and the dream is still the American dream and yet we haven't attained that and we still struggle with things. In Tin Men, it was because every Tin Man wanted the Cadillac because that meant they were a success. So it has always been the symbol of success in America, so that I've always used it in one way or another. Q11: Do you have one? BL: My father had one, as soon as we moved to suburbia and we had enough money, he got that Cadillac. Q12: Would you like to make a film about the film business? BL: I don't know, it would depend on what the . . . I mean I've done it in a peripheral way. . . AW: Well, isn't Wag the Dog really a kind of a film about the movie business? BL: Yes and how politics is the movie business, yes. I mean, so the movie business has crept into everything and certainly politics because it is a show. They need to do very much the same kind of way - they've taken more and more film techniques, in fact some of the candidates even work with directors about how to speak to an audience and what's the most effective way to do that, and so, yeah it does link up. The closest I came to it was this film called Jimmy Hollywood, which I don't really know if it was shown over here. Which was Joe Pesci and it was a really kind of modern Hollywood, which was run-down and derelict, and you have a guy who is really not mentally stable in many ways who dreams and aspires to be an actor, and because of circumstance where people think he is some kind of vigilante, he begins to play out a role and begins to think of himself in those terms. But not the film business, the inner workings of it, no. Q13: What was your continuing creative involvement with Homicide after you'd actually directed the first episode and green-lit it? BL: In terms of scripts, stories that we're going to do, I'd look at rough cuts, make suggestions. Q14: When are we going to see the last of the series - when are Channel Four going to show them? AW: We've been talking about that tonight, whether the National Film Theatre - if we can't get it on British television - whether we can get the episodes that haven't been screened in the UK. Here, as you can tell, there is a lot of enthusiasm for that, Barry. Q15: When you shot Wag the Dog, you shot it quickly. Was it strange to sit back and see life imitating art? BL: Both things, I mean we shot it very fast, we shot it in 29 days, we were supposed to shoot it in 30 but we started going so fast that we couldn't stop, y'know. And we had to do it very quickly and we did it very inexpensively, even though we had big movie stars. And then of course, obviously when events began to be close to what happened in Wag the Dog, it was shocking. To have the fact that we had a girl scout and Monica Lewinsky and they both wore berets, I mean it was. And there was a sexual act that happened in the White House and then ultimately, the bombing raid that took place, it was almost surrealistic how close it was. The ultimate irony of it, in one way and sometimes it's a little bit like, y'know you go, \"Good\". There was phenomenal reviews, except in Washington DC, and secondly the critic took us to task by saying: \"It's a stupid title for a movie, y'know, Wag the Dog\" and suddenly to turn around within six weeks to have Kissinger saying on the news \"This is not a Wag the Dog scenario\". Wag the Dog became a part of the language. And also to take task that we didn't know enough about politics because these things cannot occur and etc etc. All of these things started to occur, so I got a private joy out of that. But it is odd when you do something and how similar things are, that can happen in life. I was pretty shocked. [ Listen to the soundclip ] Q16: I just wanted to say that Liberty Heights is wonderful - are we going to have anymore Baltimore movies? BL: That's a hard question. One, I don't know if, I mean I have certain ideas and I also think it gets more difficult to do those, it gets more and more difficult to do kind of smaller, not that it's small, because it's actually fairly difficult to do those, there is over 5,000 extras and we're all over the city. Most of the things that you see don't quite exist like that. The street with all of the clubs, that doesn't exist and a lot of things had to be faked for the film. But it gets harder to do films about people. Not extraordinary people, just people. And it's harder to sell them and the marketplace gets more, kind of big event, ride films - when you read a review it's a \"real ride\". I'm still of the mind that if it's a ride, you get on the thing and you go for a ride but that the ride in a theatre has to deal with people, it has to deal with character and some of the things that I can relate to. And not that there isn't room for the some of the other things, but that you'd like to have the blend but it is getting more and more squeezed out of the market place. I mean I don't know a James Bond. That's not something I relate to on a normal basis. I can enjoy one of those movies, but I don't know a James Bond. I also like to see the things that I sort of know about, that happen in the society that we live in and the world we live in today. But it gets more and more difficult all of the time. Q17: What the process you follow when it's not a script that you've originated, what kind of input do you have? Do you rewrite? I know in Levinson on Levinson, you talked about working with James Herbert, perhaps you could just generally talk about working with other script writers. BL: Ultimately I have to be comfortable enough with the material and with the dialogue and everything else. Sometimes I will change dialogue or work with an actor and fix things if it doesn't sound right to my ear, so you modify and change things, even on scripts that you're not considered a writer. Scenes, etc, a number of things that take place. But certainly in terms of dialogue, it has to feel comfortable enough to my ear because if it doesn't, then I keep thinking something's wrong. Sometimes it's not the performance, the dialogue sticks out as something isn't natural enough for me. AW: At that point we have to stop, I'm afraid but we have got a lovely clip of Rain Man for you to end this evening. I'd like to thank the Guardian, Warner Brothers. Barry Levinson for giving us a wonderful new movie, Liberty Heights. I'd like most of all to thank Barry Levinson himself for being our guest this evening.

Many believe that one of the reasons Beijing lost out to Sydney in 1993 was because so much suspicion accompanied the world breaking feats of Ma's original Army. Two months ago Wu Yanyan, the world champion swimmer and record holder in the women's 200 metres individual medley, was thrown out of the Olympic team after testing positive for drugs. Chinese swimmers were stripped of nine of their 23 gold medals at the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima after seven of them failed drug tests. Some 10 Chinese swimmers and swimming coaches were suspended for doping offences last year.

As well as stepping up the number of dope tests and suspending those caught, China has added fines of up to 80,000 yuan (\u00a35,000) to mandatory suspensions and launched a propaganda drive to educate coaches and athletes on the risks of doping. But the message does not always get through. The commercialisation of sport in China has sparked fierce competition between coaches and athletes for scarce state sport subsidies and lucrative sponsorship deals and appearance fees. Athletes accustomed to taking a cocktail of traditional Chinese herbal medicines and daily health tonics are easily persuaded to add banned substances to their diet, officials say. \"We cannot rule out the possibility that some athletes use stimulants,\" Shi said. \"The problem is that the media over-emphasises the importance of gold medals. Winners become heroes, so athletes and coaches create a culture of gold medal worship.\" For Ma, at least, that culture will now have to change. Fungus and feuding coach no stranger to scandal 1993 Led by Wang Junxia, athletes coached by Ma Junren, win the 1,500m, 3,000m and complete a 10,000m clean sweep at the world championships in Stuttgart. A month later \"Ma's Family Army\" set world records for the 1,500m, 3,000m and 10,000m at the Chinese national games in Beijing. He attributes their success to traditional tonics of turtle's blood and caterpillar fungus 1995 Wang walks out in a dispute over training methods and prize money 1996 Wang wins the Olympic 5,000m title in Atlanta. No athlete coached by Ma reaches the games 1997 Ma foot soldier Jiang Bo sets a world record at China's national games. But an unflattering book, Revealing the Secrets of Ma's Army, is published 1998 Ma is treated in hospital for mental problems but comes out and claims he has made mistakes in the past, promising to serve China better 1999 Dong Yanmei sets a world record for 5,000m 2000 Ma's latest recruits make their debut on the European grand prix circuit and win in Athens. They fail blood tests for EPO and are thrown off the Olympic team",

      "body": "<p>On Tuesday morning William Hague reiterated that yes, he really did drink 14 pints a day in his youth. While millions have reacted to this boast with incredulity, I believe him. In fact, I'm not convinced he ever stopped. For the latest chapter of what the Tory leader calls his \"common sense revolution\" contains the first official notification of a plan that could only have been hatched in the bottom of a bottle. The Conservatives' solution to the impositions of what they call \"a European federal superstate\" is to join an American one. </p> <p>Senior Tories, backed by the Daily Telegraph, have long been campaigning for British membership of the North American Free Trade Agreement. At first the plan was to leave the European Union. Now they seem to believe that other European nations will subscribe to their interesting variety of common sense. In their draft manifesto, published on Tuesday, the Conservatives reveal that they want to \"extend the free-trade zone across the Atlantic\". The publication is called Believing in Britain. It would be better christened Believing in America. </p> <p>Quite what the basis of this belief might be is anyone's guess. If you want to know what would happen to Britain as a member of Nafta, you need only look at Mexico. The weakest member of the original pact, Mexico has become a dumping ground for the unsavoury industrial practices Americans want to keep out of their own backyards. Under the agreement, there is nothing the Mexican government can do to stop this: while in theory its signatories are obliged to offer foreign corporations precisely the same terms as domestic ones, in practice they must give them far more. Nafta empowers companies to sue governments for the removal of regulations which might affect their profits. So US corporations have begun suits against environmental protection laws in both Mexico and Canada. </p> <p> W hen the agreement was signed in 1993, its US negotiators promised that that it would generate 200,000 new American jobs a year. Four years later, US government departments admitted that they could find only 1,500 new jobs, while 204,000 had been lost. Some people suggested that the jobs had moved to Mexico, but between 1993 and 1997 unemployment there rose by 2m, while wages fell by 29% and 28,000 small firms disappeared. What had happened was that big companies, most of them from the US, merely expanded their markets at the expense of everyone else. </p> <p>As new members of Nafta, we would not be better off than Mexico, but worse, for we would be obliged to accept the outcome of negotia tions to which we were not party. The Conservatives might moan about Maastricht, but at least we were there. </p> <p>The contradictions between this crazy plan and the rest of the Tories' draft manifesto reveal a political naivety so touching that you almost want to give the poor inebriates your vote. \"To protect the competitiveness of our haulage industry\", the Tories would \"charge foreign lorries to use our roads\". Under Nafta, whose stated purpose is to create equal conditions for domestic and foreign corporations, this would be immediately struck out. The Conservatives' commendable plan to \"return discretion to local communities, enabling them to protect their neighbourhood\" is a precise description of what Nafta prevents. Whitehall, the manifesto complains, is \"imposing an oppressive uniformity and reducing the opportunity for local initiative\". Just wait till you see what Nafta can do. </p> <p>Nor, of course, is there any way in which this plan could be reconciled to the Tories' commitment to defend our \"national sovereignty\". \"We are being guided,\" the manifesto complains, \"by people who believe that Britain cannot survive as an independent nation in a global economy and should instead become a small part of a regional bloc.\" The solution? Britain should become a still smaller part of a much bigger bloc. </p> <p>It could be argued that the Tories are simply responding to an alarming global reality: under pressure from big businesses hoping to become still bigger, trade blocs are expanding and beginning to elide, with the result that national parliaments are being forced to submit to ever more supranational laws. But by insisting that he wants to keep the pound and defend our \"independence and integrity\", William Hague creates the impression that he wants to stop all this rather than encourage it. The Conservatives have long sustained the irreconcilable beliefs that while European integration is bad, global integration is good. </p> <p>If Mr Hague really sought to defend national sovereignty, there might be something to be said for him. But, for all his subtle xenophobia, in truth he is the enemy of independence. If you want to belong to a federal superstate, vote Conservative. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk\">g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "On Tuesday morning William Hague reiterated that yes, he really did drink 14 pints a day in his youth. While millions have reacted to this boast with incredulity, I believe him. In fact, I'm not convinced he ever stopped. For the latest chapter of what the Tory leader calls his \"common sense revolution\" contains the first official notification of a plan that could only have been hatched in the bottom of a bottle. The Conservatives' solution to the impositions of what they call \"a European federal superstate\" is to join an American one. Senior Tories, backed by the Daily Telegraph, have long been campaigning for British membership of the North American Free Trade Agreement. At first the plan was to leave the European Union. Now they seem to believe that other European nations will subscribe to their interesting variety of common sense. In their draft manifesto, published on Tuesday, the Conservatives reveal that they want to \"extend the free-trade zone across the Atlantic\". The publication is called Believing in Britain. It would be better christened Believing in America. Quite what the basis of this belief might be is anyone's guess. If you want to know what would happen to Britain as a member of Nafta, you need only look at Mexico. The weakest member of the original pact, Mexico has become a dumping ground for the unsavoury industrial practices Americans want to keep out of their own backyards. Under the agreement, there is nothing the Mexican government can do to stop this: while in theory its signatories are obliged to offer foreign corporations precisely the same terms as domestic ones, in practice they must give them far more. Nafta empowers companies to sue governments for the removal of regulations which might affect their profits. So US corporations have begun suits against environmental protection laws in both Mexico and Canada. W hen the agreement was signed in 1993, its US negotiators promised that that it would generate 200,000 new American jobs a year. Four years later, US government departments admitted that they could find only 1,500 new jobs, while 204,000 had been lost. Some people suggested that the jobs had moved to Mexico, but between 1993 and 1997 unemployment there rose by 2m, while wages fell by 29% and 28,000 small firms disappeared. What had happened was that big companies, most of them from the US, merely expanded their markets at the expense of everyone else. As new members of Nafta, we would not be better off than Mexico, but worse, for we would be obliged to accept the outcome of negotia tions to which we were not party. The Conservatives might moan about Maastricht, but at least we were there. The contradictions between this crazy plan and the rest of the Tories' draft manifesto reveal a political naivety so touching that you almost want to give the poor inebriates your vote. \"To protect the competitiveness of our haulage industry\", the Tories would \"charge foreign lorries to use our roads\". Under Nafta, whose stated purpose is to create equal conditions for domestic and foreign corporations, this would be immediately struck out. The Conservatives' commendable plan to \"return discretion to local communities, enabling them to protect their neighbourhood\" is a precise description of what Nafta prevents. Whitehall, the manifesto complains, is \"imposing an oppressive uniformity and reducing the opportunity for local initiative\". Just wait till you see what Nafta can do. Nor, of course, is there any way in which this plan could be reconciled to the Tories' commitment to defend our \"national sovereignty\". \"We are being guided,\" the manifesto complains, \"by people who believe that Britain cannot survive as an independent nation in a global economy and should instead become a small part of a regional bloc.\" The solution? Britain should become a still smaller part of a much bigger bloc. It could be argued that the Tories are simply responding to an alarming global reality: under pressure from big businesses hoping to become still bigger, trade blocs are expanding and beginning to elide, with the result that national parliaments are being forced to submit to ever more supranational laws. But by insisting that he wants to keep the pound and defend our \"independence and integrity\", William Hague creates the impression that he wants to stop all this rather than encourage it. The Conservatives have long sustained the irreconcilable beliefs that while European integration is bad, global integration is good. If Mr Hague really sought to defend national sovereignty, there might be something to be said for him. But, for all his subtle xenophobia, in truth he is the enemy of independence. If you want to belong to a federal superstate, vote Conservative. g.monbiot@zetnet.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>When the artist Robert Rauschenberg was a boy, his mother used to make him shirts from scraps of fabric. Collage shirts. She even made herself a skirt from the back of the suit that her brother Luther was buried in, because she didn't want the material to go to waste. For his high school graduation present, Rauschenberg wanted a ready-made shirt, his first. A decade or so later he made history with assemblages of junk: sculptures made of packing crates, rocks and rope; and paintings sewn from fabric strips. </p> <p>Now, on an August evening, Rauschenberg is home making stew to the dull murmur of a television set. He has a television on all the time, even in the studio. He cooks the way he makes art: ingredients change, spur of the moment. He's an improviser, like his mother, resuscitating scraps. </p> <p>When he settled in Captiva, a slender island off Florida's Gulf coast, 30 years ago, he lived in a beach house and worked out of a studio so small he couldn't get back far enough to see the paintings he was working on. So he built a wall away from the house to lean the paintings against. He would scramble up to his kitchen and look through the window, the only way to get a good view. \"It was magical,\" he says. \"There were only 500 people on the island. At the time everybody in New York was migrating to the Hamptons. Not me.\" </p> <p>Rauschenberg is now Captiva's biggest residential landowner. He bought the adjacent properties from elderly neighbours, whom he let live rent-free in their homes. He accumulated 35 acres, 1,000ft of beach front and nine houses. He has almost all that remains of tropical jungle on the island. He has another studio, a 17,000sq ft behemoth overlooking a swimming pool. His assistants call it the Taj Mahal. Sometimes sea otters wander into the pool from the gulf. </p> <p>Rauschenberg was initially intimidated by the palatial studio, and hesitated before settling in. He took a while to adjust to a new house, too, dawdling for months before leaving his old place. The living room of the new house is the size of the entire old house and empty except for pictures on the walls, a couch at one end and, at the other, a ping-pong table. </p> <p>At 74, he is an American institution, the paradoxical fact of an anti-orthodox career. Nine people work for him - several of whom have been with him for decades - including a computer specialist, welders and fabricators. (\"I hate the word fabricator,\" he says, joking as usual. \"It means liar, doesn't it?\") The materials he and his assistants now use reflect the price of the art, his early work having been notoriously ephemeral, to the distress of collectors who paid fortunes for it. By contrast, the recent work is extravagantly durable. </p> <p>There is a gardener who doubles as a frame-maker, and a secretary who helps with the plumbing. All are part of a small industry and also \"a small family\", in the words of Rauschenberg's friend and assistant Darryl Pottorf, who designed the new studio and house. Pottorf, whose brother Kevin works here as well, has been around for 20 years. </p> <p>\"I'm a lousy boss,\" Rauschenberg says, looking at Pottorf. </p> <p>\"You're not a boss,\" Pottorf says. </p> <p>\"That's what I mean.\" Rauschenberg smiles, perhaps not for the first time at this exchange. </p> <p>His latest show, Synapsis Shuffle, at the Whitney Museum in New York, has not been warmly received - like a lot of his work in recent years. But, materials aside, he continues to make art the way he always has, as if it were the equivalent of breathing, and he sustains an optimistic equanimity toward the results. Jasper Johns once said that no American artist has invented more than Rauschenberg. Creatively, he is still the most irrepressible artist. </p> <p>For Synapsis Shuffle he asked a group that included lifestyle guru Martha Stewart and choreographer Merce Cunningham to curate their own show from 52 of his photo-transfer panels. Everyone picked lots to establish the order of selection. Chance and collaboration, the two biggest themes in Rauschenberg's career, were to be linked with an element of irony, although that may have got lost in the shuffle. \"I wanted people who were supposed to be 'experts',\" he says, making quotation marks in the air, \"to make art.\" </p> <p>He had also thought of having a dozen taxi drivers pick the panels. \"The museum asked me about the lights, the floor, but a work like this has got to exist on its own, with its own muscles and mistakes,\" he says. </p> <p>Muscles. As with found objects and materials, Rauschenberg uses words sneakily. He mentions that when he used to play Scrabble with his mother (she died last year at the age of 97) the two of them accepted made-up words if they agreed that the words ought to be in the dictionary. </p> <p>\"Screwing things up is a virtue,\" he explains. \"Being correct is never the point. I have a fanatically correct assistant, and by the time she re-spells my words and corrects my punctuation, I can't read what I wrote. Being right can stop all the momentum of a very interesting idea.\" So with Rauschenberg you go with the flow. His flow. Serendipity and also control: the essence of his art. </p> <p>He is garrulous, mildly naughty, more resilient physically than he ought to be, adept at disguising whatever might be his temper or disappointment. These days he has a half-dozen projects percolating. He's designing announcements for a new Cunningham performance. He just signed off on prints for Al Gore's campaign, to raise money for the Democratic Party, and for Hillary Clinton: elephants seen from the rear, a broom, a donkey. \"No point being subtle,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I usually work in a direction until I know how to do it, then I stop,\" he says. \"At the time that I am bored or understand - I use those words interchangeably - another appetite has formed. A lot of people try to think up ideas; I'm not one. I'd rather accept the irresistible possibilities of what I can't ignore.\" </p> <p>Rauschenberg has just finished a series for another autumn show in New York. He says it is about struggling against what he knows how to do. The works in the living room belong to that series. Meanwhile, two years' labour on a mural for a Renzo Piano cathedral in Italy, commissioned by the Vatican, has gone for naught, he says disgustedly. The Vatican didn't like his representation of God as a gold satellite dish. \"You know, a halo, and also something that hears everything.\" Rauschenberg is perfectly sincere. Having once thought of becoming a priest, he may have had more invested in this project than in others. He backed out rather than discuss changes. </p> <p>On the television at that moment is Lauren Hutton. Rauschenberg touches the screen. Hutton is the host of an annual benefit he organises for an abused women's shelter in Fort Myers, Florida. Rauschenberg raises or donates hundreds of thousands of dollars each year for charities for women, children, medical research, politicians, artists. A chunk of his time - too much, you can sense he thinks - now goes into being Robert Rauschenberg, which is not the same as making Robert Rauschenbergs. </p> <p>Certainly this is not what he imagined 50 years ago, when nobody wanted anything from him. Or almost nobody. The often reproduced photographs of him and Susan Weil making silhouette negatives on blueprint paper, Rauschenberg's breakthrough pictures, were for Life magazine in 1951. There was other media attention too. But it was harder to succeed in the New York art world after the war than it had been during it. Peggy Guggenheim's gallery was closed. So was Stuart Levy's. Many of the European artists who had waited out Hitler in New York, enlarging the local culture, had returned to Europe. Duchamp was around but lying low. </p> <p>\"Jasper and I broke into his privacy,\" Rauschenberg says. \"Duchamp knew who we were because his wife knew everyone. She was his reporter. Everyone was trying to give up European aesthetics then. That was the struggle, and it was reflected in the fear of collectors and critics. The musician John Cage said that fear in life is the fear of change. If I may add to that: nothing can avoid changing. Because life doesn't have any other possibility, everyone can be measured by his adaptability to change.\" </p> <p>Rauschenberg and Cage became friends not when they were at Black Mountain College, as people think, but after Cage visited Rauschenberg's first show, at the Betty Parsons Gallery in 1951, and asked for one of the paintings. He was the only person who did. Cage and Rauschenberg met up a year later at Rauschenberg's loft, where the only place to sit was on the mattress. Cage started to itch. He called later and said that he was going away for a while so Rauschenberg should stay over at his place because that mattress must have bedbugs. At Cage's apartment, Rauschenberg decided to touch up the painting Cage had acquired, as a thank you. He painted it black, as he was in the midst of his all-black period. Cage returned. He was not amused. </p> <p>\"We both thought, 'Here is somebody crazier than I am,'\" Rauschenberg recalls. \"That's why we got along so well. John said I was natural Zen, while he had to choose between studying Zen or going to a psychiatrist, and Zen seemed like the better alternative.\" </p> <p>Cage also recognised what you might call the sympathetic music in Rauschenberg's art - the silence of the all-white paintings, for example. Even the famous Automobile Tire Print, for which Cage drove his Model A Ford over a strip of paper that Rauschenberg unrolled outside his studio in 1951, was a \"concrete\" score, as well as a swipe at Barnett Newman's \"zip\" paintings. At least, like a score, it was a printed version of their performance. </p> <p>\"I was mostly rejected by the visual art world,\" Rauschenberg says about the early 1950s. \"But this led me to be involved with musicians and dancers and they became my friends. Not just John and Merce but also Morty Feldman, Christian Wolff, Earle Brown. The problems they were having had a lot more to do with painting than the people who were whining about how the latest collector in town had bought a de Kooning instead of one of their paintings. </p> <p>\"Art can be like furniture - static, clumsy. The point of collaboration is to counteract that. For me, art shouldn't be a fixed idea that I have before I start making it. I want it to include all the fragility and doubt that I go through the day with. Sometimes I'll take a walk just to forget whatever good idea I had that day because I like to go into the studio not having any ideas. I want the insecurity of not knowing, like performers feel before a performance. Everything I know, I have probably already done, or somebody else has.\" </p> <p>Rauschenberg recalls an idea he once had for an exhibition of paintings imitating different abstract expressionists. \"Imagine the luxury, the energy and the iridescent glory of doing a Rothko,\" he says. \"Of course, it would have been blaspheming, but can you think what it would be like to throw yourself into that incredible mood? Then out of respect I decided I wouldn't paint like Rothko or Franz Kline because I'd be in their way and they in mine.\" </p> <p>He's smiling again. </p> <p>\u00a9 2000 New York Times</p>",

      "bodyText": "The troubleshooter hired to save the Millennium Dome yesterday admitted it should never have been built as Downing Street again insisted the prime minister still had confidence in it. David James, the corporate fixer,was also scathing about the lack of a proper investigation into the dome's topsy-turvy finances until he commissioned a damning 100-page report from auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers. \"It should have been done quite a long time ago,\" he said. With costs spiralling towards \u00a3830m, Mr James said the \"black hole\" in the books was caused by a lack of any proper records of the dome's assets or a register of the 2,800 contracts it had with suppliers. But building it at all, and particularly building it in badly linked Greenwich, were the gravest errors, he said. \"Clearly it was not perhaps a wise decision,\" he said. \"I am a sweeper up of companies. I am not a creator of businesses. Nobody asked for my opinion at the beginning. If they had it would have been an interesting input.\" In another disclosure that will further embarrass the government, Mr James claimed the Japanese consortium Nomura are \"going to make a killing\" by buying the dome for \u00a3105m. \"We are selling the place for a fraction of its value. They will have learned the lessons of the site at our expense. They are going to make a killing.\" Even so, Nomura, hinted yesterday that they might pull out of the deal after discovering visitor targets have been radically reduced, although this was widely interpreted as a ploy to drive the price down further.

After implicitly conceding that the dome has failed to live up to its billing as \"the greatest show on earth\", the government has tried to save face by redefining it as an economic development success.

Cracks also appeared yesterday in the eight-strong millennium commission, which triggered the present row by awarding another \u00a347m lottery cash on Tuesday. The Earl of Dalkeith admitted they had considered closing it immediately and he was \"very unhappy\" about giving the dome any extra money.

      "bodyText": "Anabolic steroids Steroids are synthetic substances related to testosterone, the male sex hormone. While these drugs have medical uses, including treating delayed puberty and some types of impotence, their use can reduce sperm production, shrink the testicles, and cause impotence and breast enlargement in men. Women can develop more masculine characteristics such as deepening of the voice and excessive body hair. Steroids can also stunt bone growth and damage the heart, liver and kidneys. Steroids were widely used in the 1960s and 70s until an effective test was introduced in 1975. Widespread abuse died out among elite athletes after the 1988 Olympics, when Ben Johnson was stripped of his 100 metres title. A number of British athletes, including the 1992 Olympic 100m champion Linford Christie, have been banned after testing positive for nandrolone, a steroid.

      "bodyText": "At least four UN refugee workers were murdered yesterday in west Timor and their office destroyed when thousands of pro-Indonesian militiamen attacked the building during a rampage through the area. Several other staff from international aid organisations in the Indonesian territory helping the tens of thousands of east Timorese refugees in camps around the town of Atambua were injured. One Brazilian woman was repeatedly attacked by an axe-wielding militiaman. All foreign workers in the town were evacuated. Some fled to the provincial capital, Kupang, while four UN helicopters airlifted 55 to the town of Balibo in east Timor. Last night, as reports came in that the militiamen were heading towards Kupang, the UN in Jakarta announced that it would evacuate all its staff from west Timor today and would assist any international organisations wishing to pull out their employees. It is unclear what fate awaits the east Timorese refugees who have been terrorised by the militia since they were forced to flee their homeland when pro-Jakarta thugs went on a rampage after the territory voted overwhelmingly for independence in August 1999. Yesterday's attack on staff working for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees began when about 20 trucks full of militia, many armed with machetes and homemade rifles, pulled up in front of their Atambua office, a local eyewitness said. \"They first lit fires in front of the office and then threw stones at the windows and fired into the office,\" he said. \"They then set fire to one of the UNHCR cars before attacking the office itself. The building was destroyed.\" At least three bodies were dragged out of the office in the ensuing carnage, he said. \"They were dumped in front of the building and set on fire.\" Police sources said that an Ethiopian, a Puerto Rican, a Croatian and a Malaysian were killed and that one other person might be missing. The militiamen, who had gathered in the town the previous evening to mourn a murdered leader, were joined by thousands of colleagues and then set off in search of the approximately 25 foreigners living in Atambua. Several buildings were destroyed and locals who had helped international organisations were attacked. Neither the Indonesian police, whose office is less than 100 yards from the UNHCR office, nor the military, made any serious attempt to intervene until later. None of the attackers was arrested. The west Timor military commander, Colonel Jurefar, said his troops could not control the militiamen. \"We tried to quell the situation but some just went wild.\" The UN high commissioner for refugees, Sadako Ogata, said she was deeply disappointed at the failure of the Indonesian authorities to make good on their commitment to protect her staff. \"These were peaceful, unarmed humanitarians who gave their lives trying to help those who had lost everything in conflict,\" she said. Many of the foreigners had only returned to Atambua this week, when the UNHCR decided it was safe enough to resume operations in the area after three staff were badly beaten up in a west Timor refugee camp last month. Sulaiman Abdulmanan, the Indonesian foreign ministry spokesman, said his government was appalled by the incident. He insisted that the authorities were not actively supporting the militia. But diplomats in Jakarta have said they have conclusive proof that elements of the Indonesian military are actively training and equipping the militia.",

      "body": "<p>Leaders of the West Side Boys holding six Royal Irish regiment soldiers hostage near Freetown want Britain to guarantee them safe passage out of Sierra Leone and to provide them with an education abroad.</p> <p>The demand is apparently modelled on a deal five years ago in which Sierra Leone's former military ruler, Valentine Strasser, was admitted to Warwick university to remove him from the political scene.</p> <p>The scheme has been put to British officials by Johnny Paul Koroma, another former military ruler once served by the West Side Boys. He now heads the government's peace commission. Mr Koroma revealed the demand after relatives of the hostage takers returned from a visit to the village where the captives are held, about 30 miles from Freetown.</p> <p>\"Some of them want to get out of the country,\" he said. \"They want to study in some vocational institute so that when they come back later they will be useful to the country.</p> <p>\"I think the bottom line is fear. We will talk to the British, we will talk to the government, to guarantee their security.\"</p> <p>There is little chance that the West Side Boys' 24-year-old leader, the frequently drugged and drunk \"Brigadier\" Foday Kallay, will find himself at St Andrews with Prince William. His last job was as a gateman at the defence ministry.</p> <p>If nothing else, Warwick's experience with Mr Strasser will deter many British universities from taking on former fighters.

      "bodyText": "Leaders of the West Side Boys holding six Royal Irish regiment soldiers hostage near Freetown want Britain to guarantee them safe passage out of Sierra Leone and to provide them with an education abroad. The demand is apparently modelled on a deal five years ago in which Sierra Leone's former military ruler, Valentine Strasser, was admitted to Warwick university to remove him from the political scene. The scheme has been put to British officials by Johnny Paul Koroma, another former military ruler once served by the West Side Boys. He now heads the government's peace commission. Mr Koroma revealed the demand after relatives of the hostage takers returned from a visit to the village where the captives are held, about 30 miles from Freetown. \"Some of them want to get out of the country,\" he said. \"They want to study in some vocational institute so that when they come back later they will be useful to the country. \"I think the bottom line is fear. We will talk to the British, we will talk to the government, to guarantee their security.\" There is little chance that the West Side Boys' 24-year-old leader, the frequently drugged and drunk \"Brigadier\" Foday Kallay, will find himself at St Andrews with Prince William. His last job was as a gateman at the defence ministry. If nothing else, Warwick's experience with Mr Strasser will deter many British universities from taking on former fighters. After his fellow students found out about his bloody past, he dropped out of his law studies and became a nightclub bouncer. But it is quite possible that another African country can be persuaded to accept Brig Kallay and his cohorts for some kind of training programme as a contribution to peace in Sierra Leone. \"We've not specified any country at all,\" Mr Koroma said. \"Wherever they want to send them; it might be Nigeria, it might be Ghana or Zambia, it might be any country in Africa. It is not necessarily Britain.\" The West Side Boys want those fighters who are not sent abroad to be guaranteed places in Sierra Leone's new British-trained army. British officials have declined to comment while negotiations continue but the proposals could indicate that the Boys have backed away from their original demand for the release of two of their leaders and other comrades from prison,and are seeking a way out of the hostage crisis. Such a deal would also have the attraction of removing the West Side Boys as a violent and maverick force so close to Freetown. Brig Kallay has told relatives he fears that if he frees the British captives his fighters will be vulnerable to attack by the Sierra Leone army or UN forces. His elder brother, Maxim Sesay, said the renegade leader was seeking assurances from the British for his security. \"He wants to come out but he has no confidence in this present government,\" Mr Sesay said. \"They have arrested some of his brothers [in the West Side Boys]. He himself is afraid because of what he has done.\" In an attempt to reassure the hostage takers, Sierra Leone's attorney general yesterday said he had no plans to prosecute them for holding the soldiers captive.

Environmental activists are considering a class action against Doe Run, a lead mining company owned by the Renco corporation of America, brought on behalf of at least 100 people. The possible environmental action is one of several lawsuits filed against mining companies owned by Renco, the private company which is in talks to buy RJB Mining, the British coal mining group. RJB is likely to be questioned on the takeover talks when it an nounces its interim results today. Sources close to the company said a deal was unlikely to be announced today as Renco was still finalising the details of a takeover offer for the British group. Discussions started in June. The possibility of a class action lawsuit in an area where it has taken steps to improve its environmental record is an embarrassment for Renco, which was dubbed \"one of the biggest air polluters in America\" by Hillary Clinton. Both Doe Run and the Magnesium Corporation of America, a Utah-based mine group owned by Renco, have repeatedly clashed with the US government over environmental failures. The latest action concerns alleged air and water pollution by Doe Run's operations in south-eastern Missouri.

      "bodyText": "Al Gore launched what he hopes will be a decisive strike against the tax-cutting proposals of his presidential election rival George W Bush yesterday, when he offered millions of low and middle income Americans a boost to their wealth while promising to safeguard state funding for social services. In a keynote speech in Cleveland which established the most striking contrast to date in the positions of the two main candidates, Mr Gore set out an economic stall based on redistributing the fruits of America's hi-tech economic boom rather than on large tax cuts preferred by Mr Bush. \"My plan wasn't built on the cross-your-fingers economics that says we can give more to the people who already have the most and then just hope the benefits trickle down to the middle-class,\" Mr Gore said. With the polls already moving in his favour in the past three weeks, Mr Gore clearly intended his speech - and a 190-page budget plan which he also released yesterday - to deliver a hammer blow against Republican hopes of recapturing the White House in November. Mr Bush's economic plans, which centre on tax cuts, would leave America $2.8 trillion in debt by 2012, Mr Gore alleged. The Bush plan \"gives most to those who need it the least, and the least to those who need it the most - and that's just wrong,\" Mr Gore said. Mr Gore's economic agenda is aimed at raising the income of families on average earnings - currently just under $50,000 a year [\u00a333,000] - by a third in real terms over a decade and to double the number of families with savings in excess of $50,000. Mr Gore also promised that the gap between the earnings of men and women, currently 27 cents in the dollar, would be halved by 2010, and that the percentage of Americans who are defined as living in poverty would fall below 10% for the first time in the nation's history. Mr Gore also promised to oversee the creation of 10m \"high quality, hi-tech, high-skill jobs\" in a decade, to raise the numbers of US college students by 75% by making tuition fees tax deductible, and to expand home ownership to a record level of 70% of all families. Alongside these eye-catching pledges, Mr Gore simultaneously committed himself to reduce income tax by 2002 on the typical American family to its lowest level since the second world war. But perhaps the strongest evidence of the political and economic \"win-win\" opportunity which Mr Gore set out in his speech were a series of fiscally conservative public spending pledges that earlier Democrats never had the luxury to offer. Mr Gore told his audience at Cleveland State University that he would continue to balance the US federal budget each year, and committed him self to eliminate the entire federal deficit by 2012. Every dollar that was already pledged to the federal social security pension fund and to the Medicare programme for the elderly would be \"lockboxed\", he promised. And in a further pledge of fiscal caution Mr Gore said he would put a sixth of the federal budget surplus each year into a new federal reserve fund \"for a rainy day\". \"We will underspend the surplus rather than over-promise our way into an economic hole,\" Mr Gore said, offering a pledge which strategists believe will be especially popular with women voters, who tend to prefer fiscal caution more readily than men. \"If today's economic forecasts fall short, this new reserve fund will guarantee that we will not have to cut education or health care,\" Mr Gore pledged. \"The Gore-Lieberman eco nomic plan has one guiding purpose: to help the middle- class families who have always been America's purpose and its pride,\" Mr Gore said. \"No blank cheques.

      "body": "<p>The London arm of the Japanese bank Nomura International has become one of the City's biggest movers and shakers.</p> <p>Under the control of Guy Hands, a close friend of William Hague, Nomura has snapped up bargains across British industry. It took over 57,000 Ministry of Defence properties, bought over 5,000 pubs and took a slice of the privatised railways. Only last month it just missed out on buying a Welsh water company and admitted taking a look at BAe Systems, the country's second largest defence contractor.</p> <p>But the dome might be the best deal of all. Some experts believe the 63 acres it would acquire in Greenwich along with the dome could be the next Canary Wharf. For \u00a3108m it could be sitting on assets in future valued in billions.</p> <p>British property group Quintain Estates and Development recently bought land adjoining the dome and believes the area, which is only separated from Canary Wharf by a few feet of water, is an obvious candidate for huge redevelopment.</p> <p>Nick Shattock, a Quintain director with responsibility for its Greenwich site, last night said: \"Canary Wharf will be fully let by 2003 and then the search is on for the next Canary Wharf. There is the Elephant and Castle and Paddington Basin but this site (Greenwich) is definitely a contender.\" He points out that riverside land attracts values of \u00a35m per acre in Wandsworth, up river.

      "bodyText": "The London arm of the Japanese bank Nomura International has become one of the City's biggest movers and shakers. Under the control of Guy Hands, a close friend of William Hague, Nomura has snapped up bargains across British industry. It took over 57,000 Ministry of Defence properties, bought over 5,000 pubs and took a slice of the privatised railways. Only last month it just missed out on buying a Welsh water company and admitted taking a look at BAe Systems, the country's second largest defence contractor. But the dome might be the best deal of all. Some experts believe the 63 acres it would acquire in Greenwich along with the dome could be the next Canary Wharf. For \u00a3108m it could be sitting on assets in future valued in billions. British property group Quintain Estates and Development recently bought land adjoining the dome and believes the area, which is only separated from Canary Wharf by a few feet of water, is an obvious candidate for huge redevelopment. Nick Shattock, a Quintain director with responsibility for its Greenwich site, last night said: \"Canary Wharf will be fully let by 2003 and then the search is on for the next Canary Wharf. There is the Elephant and Castle and Paddington Basin but this site (Greenwich) is definitely a contender.\" He points out that riverside land attracts values of \u00a35m per acre in Wandsworth, up river. The 63 acres to be bought by Nomura could be worth almost three times the amount it paid. It underlines why David James, incoming chairman of the New Millenium Experience Company said yesterday that the dome was being sold for a fraction of its value and Nomura stood to make a \"killing\". Mr Shattock points out that the Greenwich peninsula already has the biggest tube station in Europe with a 10 minute ride to the City. The underground is being used at only 10% of capacity, a position which compares with Canary Wharf itself which suffered badly in its early stages from a poorly performing Docklands light railway. But Mr Shattock says no mega development at Greenwich can be guaranteed. It will depend on a scheme being approved inside an urban development plan being drawn up by Greenwich council and the Greater London authority. Nomura admits it has plans to build some residential and commercial properties on the dome land but says this is only a secondary aspect of its purchase. A spokesman for the company said last night: \"Nomura wants to buy the dome to make it into a successful entertainment venue.

Lord Justice Ward put forward the argument that it could not have been intended that severely disabled Mary, who only survives because she is connected to her sister Jodie, should be kept alive. The judge's remarks came as independent doctors, who were asked to give a second opinion on the girls, said they broadly agreed that the twins should be separated, against the wishes of the parents. The judge also admitted the case had caused him sleepless nights. The parents of Mary and Jodie are appealing against a high court ruling giving doctors at St Mary's hospital in Manchester the go-ahead to separate the twins, though the operation would lead to Mary's death. Devout Catholics, they have said they want nature to take its course despite warnings that if the operation does not take place, both girls will die. In written evidence, they have declared that they do not believe that it is God's will that the twins should be separated.

N.B, 24, found not guilty on both charges at Cambridge crown court, said he would have to live with the trauma of the case for years. Jason Coulter, his solicitor, said: \u201cRape allegations carry a particular stigma and there are always those who\u2019ll say there\u2019s no smoke without fire.\u201d Jurors were told the alleged attack took place at a housewarming party organised last September by graduates of Homerton College, Cambridge. The court was told that N.B had met the woman, a recently qualified teacher, at the party and that both had drunk a lot. She said she had collapsed on a bed alongside another man when she saw N.B walk into the room. \u201cI remember someone kissing me on the mouth,\u201d she told the court. \u201cI remember saying no, and the next thing my jeans were being tugged off.\u201d She said N.B had performed a sex act on her despite her repeatedly shouting no. N.B, a Cambridge post-graduate, said he had been too drunk to remember any of the events which had led to him being charged. Forensic tests showed traces of N.B\u2019s DNA in the woman\u2019s hair but scientists could find no proof that sexual intercourse had taken place.

Enthusiasts say scores would increase consumer power, and point to a US system of publishing information on food hygiene arrangements on visiting cruise ships as a model. This is said strongly to influence tourist bookings.</p> <p>Food standards officials believe a system for publishing individual ratings could be added to new arrangements for local authority reporting of food poisoning incidents and hygiene standards within their areas.</p> <p>These will mirror tougher inspection regimes and league tables already introduced by the government for schools and social services, and reflect government concern at the patchy nature of food hygiene enforcement.</p> <p>They will be phased in from January if they are approved by the agency's board later this month. In addition, all food businesses will soon have to prove themselves worthy of holding licences to trade under EU rules which will take four years to introduce.</p> <p>The Consumers' Association yesterday called on the public to help to combat the huge under-reporting of food poisoning cases.

      "bodyText": "Britain's 550,000 eating places and food shops - from top hotels to hospital canteens and burger vans - might have to display hygiene scores to help customers choose whether to use them. The ratings would be based on inspections by local council officials on compliance with health, safety, and food handling regulations. The government's food standards agency is discussing the idea with consumer groups and environmental health bodies. Enthusiasts say scores would increase consumer power, and point to a US system of publishing information on food hygiene arrangements on visiting cruise ships as a model. This is said strongly to influence tourist bookings. Food standards officials believe a system for publishing individual ratings could be added to new arrangements for local authority reporting of food poisoning incidents and hygiene standards within their areas. These will mirror tougher inspection regimes and league tables already introduced by the government for schools and social services, and reflect government concern at the patchy nature of food hygiene enforcement. They will be phased in from January if they are approved by the agency's board later this month. In addition, all food businesses will soon have to prove themselves worthy of holding licences to trade under EU rules which will take four years to introduce. The Consumers' Association yesterday called on the public to help to combat the huge under-reporting of food poisoning cases. Only about 100,000 a year are formally recorded and it is believed the true figure could be 4.5m in England alone. As many as 60 people a year may die. Ann Goodwin, of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health, which is also involved in the discussions on hygiene scores, said: \" Why not inform consumers? Then they can vote with their feet.\" She said there was no reason why a voluntary scheme could not be introduced quickly once a national framework was agreed, even if formal regulation might take longer. \"What would businesses have to hide?\" The agency is already planning big increases in information local councils have to provide so it can compare the performance of different types of shops, restaurants and other food outlets in different areas, even if these would not be individually named at present. These tables will be published and agency officials will also inspect councils' environmental health departments and demand improvements where necessary. Tom Murray, head of the agency's local authority enforcement division, confirmed the publication of individual ratings was being considered carefully but there were difficulties to overcome. \"Any system we put together would have to be objective and robust and applied consistently.\" Businesses might just be having a bad day when inspected. Should new owners or managers have to display poor ratings from previous management?

Which said, Wilcox and his wife and professional partner, Esther Rantzen, cannot be altogether cleared from a shred of blame for the later debasement of this branch of television, when compassion turns into exploitation.</p> <p>Born in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, and thus into the heartland of early 20th-century social idealism, the young Desmond attended schools in Cheltenham and London before going to the Outward Bound Sea School, and thence into the merchant navy in 1948 as a deckhand. His National Service soon afterwards, however, was in the army, as a lieutenant. He had already fitted in a bit of local-newspaper reporting.

To augment his salary, he did extra Saturday stints for the Sunday Pictorial, the Mirror's then stablemate.</p> <p>While helping out on an expos\u00e9 of a criminal gang, he was hit on the head with a car-jack, an injury which left him temporarily paralysed.</p> <p>When he resumed work, he was put on the \"graveyard shift\", in the small hours of the morning, when seldom much happens. Leafing through a trade paper, he spotted a job advertisement for a reporter on a current affairs television programme. From the wording, he deduced that it was ITV's This Week, and applied directly to Rediffusion rather than the given box number. This stroke of enterprise impressed the producers, despite the fact that he had tripped over and fallen flat on his face when summoned for an audition. He was taken on, and his open face and forthright manner soon made him popular with the audience.</p> <p>In 1965, Wilcox moved to the BBC's newly-established second channel to present and edit, with Bill Morton, the first current affairs series, Man Alive, avowedly devoted to such human predicaments as agoraphobia or the search for an ideal partner. \"They wheel a plague cart through the world,\" I wrote at the time, \"crying 'Bring out your dread.' \" But there were some powerful episodes, and, within three years, the Man Alive Unit was a little free state within the BBC empire.</p> <p>In 1972 Wilcox was promoted to be the BBC's head of general features, where he stayed until 1980.

Initially, it consisted of one-off films to the early cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 formula of catching its subject about to undergo some crucial encounter. One programme, for example, was about a family going to see their mentally handicapped daughter in her residential home.

They were blessed not only with a family but also a continuing strand of light-hearted, consumer watchdog programmes in the Braden mould, of which That's Life was the best-known and most durable, running from 1973 to 1994, with Rantzen at the helm as presenter.</p> <p>The BBC had always maintained a rule not to employ married couples, especially if one of them occupied an executive position.

      "body": "<p>Roy Fredericks, 59 times a Test batsman for the West Indies, sustained an approach to the game that was an endearing enigma. No one was ever quite sure how he would choose to construct his innings, though they were invariably in the best interest, as he saw it, of his side. Once, against England at Edgbaston, he anchored cussedly for 8 hours while scoring 150. It may have been against his nature, but it saved the West Indies from defeat.</p> <p>This small, congenial left-hander, who has died aged 57, was happiest when going for his shots: and that was what happened much of the time. A voracious hooker, he remained fallible - keeping fine and long legs in business - to the short-pitched ball. But there was much of merit: the wristy aggression, the generous array of strokes on both sides of the wicket, the disregard for reputation. He made 40 hundreds, eight of them for his country, and there was nothing more exhilarating or courageous than his century off 71 balls on his way to 169 against Australia at Perth during the 1975-76 series. Thomson and Lillee were never made to feel more impotent. That was truly great batting. He scored 4,334 runs in Tests at an average of 42.49, took 62 catches and seven wickets with his slow left-arm.</p> <p>Fredericks came from Blairmont, Berbice, British Guiana. He was blessed with good eyes, fast feet and sturdy forearms. A cricket bat was, as in the case of so many boys from the Caribbean, the natural metaphor for progress. The fierce power of his hitting belied his small stature; he was to play for British Guiana/Guyana from 1963 to 1983. His last matches for them, something of a surprise return, came at the age of 40. As if eloquently making a resilient statement from middle-age, while justifying that isolated late inclusion, he scored 103 and 217. It was a fine if theatrical finale, much enjoyed by those who watched and doted. He gave his bat away after that and went back to being Minister of Sport.</p> <p>Over a career of 20 years he scored 16,384 runs at an average of 45.89. From 1971-73 he played 45 times for Glamorgan - his team mates, and Wales, took to him. So they should have, after his memorable debut for the county at Trent Bridge. He creamed 66 in the first innings and 145 in the second. Nottinghamshire's captain, Garry Sobers, led the applause. Fredericks' new county immediately awarded him his cap. His new skipper, Tony Lewis, recalls: \"He was a delightful chap to handle. His humour was infectious and he had a fantastic range of shots. But I suspect he found the sheer volume of cricket fixtures difficult at times.\"</p> <p>In only his third game, he broke a bone in his forearm and missed a number of matches. He still passed his 1,000 runs, and there was much heady and lyrical Celtic talk about what he would achieve in the following season. In truth he didn't always succeed, because of that sense of impetuous adventure, but he figured in a record opening stand with Alan Jones for his county. The pair put on 330 against Northants at the St Helens ground in Swansea. \"I should say that two thirds of the runs came from 'Freddo' - he really was a great player when on song. He had this terrific belief in his own ability and there were wonderful occasions when no one could bowl at him. Yet there was no holding back when the ball had been pitched short - he'd go for a big one whether it was the first or last ball of the day,\" Jones recalls.</p> <p>The two Glamorgan openers built up a warm relationship. Jones, naturally analytical - as his work as a county coach has shown - would discuss over a drink with Fredericks the hazards of the impulsive hook. Once, going through a barren spell, and maybe needing some reassurance, Fredericks was first off the team coach when they arrived at the new hotel reception after midnight. Jones, following up, was told by his partner: \"I've booked you in with me, old chap.\" It was always \"old chap\", whether they were sharing a drink or a scampered run. They shared rooms from then on, one imparting technical advice, the other bombarding Jones with calypso music that went onto into the early hours. \"Don't worry, old chap - you'll drop off to sleep.\"</p> <p>They remained good friends despite Fredericks' suspect judgment over a sharp single. That they got into \"all sorts of trouble between the wickets\" could perhaps be put down to a minor linguistic problem; Fredericks would lapse into crease-side homilies in a Guyanese patois, while Jones was Welsh-speaking. The humour was never far away. When Yorkshire came to play Glamorgan at Swansea, \"Freddo\" was left to face just two overs before the close of play on the first day. And he was caught at fine-leg.</p> <p>Jones overheard Yorkshire's Tony Nicholson, as the players were coming off the field, saying how they could dismiss Fredericks any time they wanted because he couldn't resist the temptation to hook. The little West Indian was solemnly told the gist of that conversation. \"We'll see about that, old chap.\" The next day, in the Sunday League, the Yorkies were taken apart by Fredericks, whose rapid 88 contained seven sixes and eight fours.</p> <p>Fredericks liked to be in the game. He bowled disconcerting googlies and chinamen; he fielded alertly, either in the covers or close to the wicket. As for his batting, he was often brilliant, occasionally erratic. Only that slight suggestion of moodiness separated him from our great batsmen; there were moments when his reflexes and instinctive movement were sublime.</p> <p>His best innings was 250 for Guyana against Barbados at Bridgetown. In all there were four double hundreds. Colleagues, back on the players' balcony, could usually tell after the first few strokes whether it was a day for the bowlers to take their sweaters and go home. He toured England three times with the West Indies, and was here for the World Cup in 1975; he also went with the team to Australia and New Zealand, India, Pakistan and Ceylon. And he was an obvious candidate for World Series Cricket in Australia.</p> <p>Fredericks later settled partially for a political life at home, being a conscientious Minister of Sport. For a short time he was a West Indies selector. He coached and managed Guyana, and encouraged young native players. When he met contemporaries he had known in England, he would say: \"And how is that Wilfred Wooller, old chap?\"</p> <p><b>Roy Clifton Fredericks, cricketer, born November 11 1942; died September 5 2000</b></p>",

Michel Bon, France T\u00e9l\u00e9com president, said the postponement of the flotations of T-Online, the German mobile phone business, and KPN Mobile of the Netherlands had opened a clear path for Orange to float. France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, which owns a third of NTL, Britain's biggest cable company, bought Orange from Vodafone in an opportunistic strike earlier this year. The company will rejoin the market after an extraordinary year in which it has gone from being independent to having three owners in quick succession. It was bought by Mannessman of Germany which was then bought by Vodafone and which in turn sold Orange on to France T\u00e9l\u00e9com for \u00a326bn in May. Yesterday France T\u00e9l\u00e9com reported a modest rise in core first-half earnings but fierce competition dented profit margins in its fixed line and mobile business. Earnings in the first half yesterday came in at the top end of analysts' forecasts with operating profits up 7.8% to \u20ac2.6bn. The impact of the integration of Orange and the licence bids will not make itself felt until next year. The cash from a flotation of Orange will not go amiss at France T\u00e9l\u00e9com, which has been burdened by the high cost of bidding for third generation mobile phone licences across Europe. Belgium yesterday became the latest country to announce that it had decided on an auction of its next generation mobile licences. France T\u00e9l\u00e9com already has a presence through its joint venture there with the Netherlands' KPN. The growing dominance of formerly state-owned European telecoms companies was further in evidence yesterday when Deutsche Telekom stepped in as a potential rescuer of Iaxis, the pan-European network owner which fell into administration on Tuesday. The company is expected to sell for only tens of millions of dollars, compared with valuations of up to $1.8bn (\u00a31.2bn) when it was planning to float last year, providing another cautionary tale for investors swept up in the now largely dispelled hype which enveloped the sector. Telemonde, the Kevin Maxwell-owned company from which Iaxis was spun out last year, contradicted speculation that it was considering a rescue bid. Iaxis spent $200m building its network across the continent with cash from a range of investors led by a Chicago-based private equity firm, Wynnchurch Capital. The company owes some $40m to its main equipment suppliers, Ciena and Nortel.

USA Today said that the companies - some of them no more than family-run workshops - heated, milled and cut to shape tonnes of uranium, thorium, polonium, beryllium and other radioactive substances for use in the production of atomic weapons. Often safety equipment was installed only as an afterthought, many years later, and some workers were exposed to daily radiation levels hundreds of times the maximum safe dose. According to the report, which the paper said was based on 10 months' research, there have been no studies of the workers and residents to discover how many fell ill and died as a result of their exposure to radiation, but it cited a handful of anecdotal cases of cancer and liver failure. It said that several sites, where factories spewed dust into the air or groundwater, were still radioactive today.

This would be true if only the ablest 18-year-olds attempted A-levels and all those that did not did not do so because they lacked ability. But the decision to attempt A-levels also depends on something other than ability - such as your parents' income and expectations.</p> <p>Suppose that in 1950 all children in the top 20% of the income distribution enter for an examination. Of the rest of the population, only the most able 10% enter. Suppose also that the ability is distributed uniformly in the range 0-10 and is not correlated with parental income. Finally, suppose scores in the exam exactly reflect ability. A simple calculation will show that the mean score, taking the rich (average score 5) and the ablest of the poor (average score 9.5) together, will be 6.29.</p> <p>Now suppose that today all the children of the rich still enter for the exam, but so do the most able 50% of the rest of the income distribution. The mean score, taking rich (average score 5) and the rest (average score 7.5) together, is now 6.67. Average performance has improved, even though twice as many people are taking the examination.</p> <p><b>Dr Terry O'Shaughnessy</b><br> St Anne's College, Oxford</p> <p>\u0095Twenty years ago, in the sciences, of which I have experience, it was assumed the marks were normally distributed and a certain percent ages of candidates were put into each grade. To get a grade A meant that you were in the top 10% or so and the grade with the most candidates was C.</p> <p>Nowadays some alternative method of fixing the grade boundary must be used. In the physics exams this year, the grade with the largest number of candidates was A and that with the smallest E, with a steady decrease down the grades. Higher proportions of grade As may mean more candidates achieving a higher standard, or it might reflect that more \"weaker\" candidates avoid these subjects. This pattern was repeated in a number of other traditional subjects, though not with the more modern subjects.</p> <p><b> Ian Telfer</b><br> Shepton Mallet, Somerset</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095Chris Woodhead (A-levels too easy, September 4) and many others believe that because the number of candidates taking A-levels and their average scores have gone up, the examinations must be easier. This would be true if only the ablest 18-year-olds attempted A-levels and all those that did not did not do so because they lacked ability. But the decision to attempt A-levels also depends on something other than ability - such as your parents' income and expectations. Suppose that in 1950 all children in the top 20% of the income distribution enter for an examination. Of the rest of the population, only the most able 10% enter. Suppose also that the ability is distributed uniformly in the range 0-10 and is not correlated with parental income. Finally, suppose scores in the exam exactly reflect ability. A simple calculation will show that the mean score, taking the rich (average score 5) and the ablest of the poor (average score 9.5) together, will be 6.29. Now suppose that today all the children of the rich still enter for the exam, but so do the most able 50% of the rest of the income distribution. The mean score, taking rich (average score 5) and the rest (average score 7.5) together, is now 6.67. Average performance has improved, even though twice as many people are taking the examination. Dr Terry O'Shaughnessy St Anne's College, Oxford \u0095Twenty years ago, in the sciences, of which I have experience, it was assumed the marks were normally distributed and a certain percent ages of candidates were put into each grade. To get a grade A meant that you were in the top 10% or so and the grade with the most candidates was C. Nowadays some alternative method of fixing the grade boundary must be used. In the physics exams this year, the grade with the largest number of candidates was A and that with the smallest E, with a steady decrease down the grades. Higher proportions of grade As may mean more candidates achieving a higher standard, or it might reflect that more \"weaker\" candidates avoid these subjects. This pattern was repeated in a number of other traditional subjects, though not with the more modern subjects. Ian Telfer Shepton Mallet, Somerset",

It is also on the brink of an oil windfall that varies from large to stupendous, depending on who you are talking to. Azerbaijan's share of the oil reserves under the Caspian sea are estimated to be worth around $80bn, but there could be much more. Fisherman's Wharf is one of many restaurants that have sprung up to cater for the city's sizeable foreign population.

There's not a wharf or a fisherman in sight. The restaurant sits in a public park, separated from it by a narrow moat stocked with a few chubby goldfish. While the diners enjoy tequila and chicken fajitas, the Azeris sitting in the park have to make do with the simpler pleasures of Russian ice cream. The moat between the park and the restaurant is only a few feet wide, but as far as the ordinary Azeris are concerned it might as well be the Caspian sea.</p> <p>The average wage in Azerbaijan is about $40 a month, barely enough for a round of drinks at one of the expat watering holes. In spite of the oil, living standards have fallen since the country became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991. And yet, in Baku at least, it is hard to escape the evidence of the oil boom. At a Mitsubishi dealership, Azerbaijan's new elite pay cash for new four-by-fours. Rugged vehicles are prized because they can stand up to the potholed roads. Enormous mansions are going up on the outskirts of the city and the view from the public beach includes an oil platform just offshore: the new money is visible everywhere, and everywhere there is an opportunity to spend it: outlets for designer clothes, sushi bars, numberless basement dives lined with sad-eyed prostitutes from central Asia.</p> <p>There's an odd symmetry, too, about the glut of foreign investment in the oil industry. At the dawn of the 20th century, Azerbaijan produced half of the world's supply of oil. The Rothschilds and the Nobels were among those who made fortunes here. Azerbaijan has been producing oil for more than 100 years, and yet the wealth seems to have flowed out of the country without leaving much of a residue for the majority of its people.</p> <p>There are some elaborate turn-of-the-century mansions in the old city that were built with the first flush of oil money, but vast swathes of the country give no indication of the wealth it is heir to. The president of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, is fond of telling his people that the country is developing with every passing day, and they can look forward to excellent lives. But some Azeris are already sick of hearing they're going to be the new Kuwait.</p> <p>\"Five years ago, they said everything was going to be great in five years,\" says Rasul, a 20-year-old worker on Oily Rocks, a Stalin-era oil platform. This mind-boggling collection of rusty roads and oily wells stands on trestles 60 miles out to sea. There were once 120 miles of roads defying the elements at Oily Rocks, but three-quarters of them have fallen apart. Rasul told me he'd had enough, and was waiting for a visa to emigrate to the Netherlands.</p> <p>On the streets of Baku, unemployed teachers and former soldiers jostle for work sanding the parquet floors of the newly rich.

He says that even if he fired everyone who takes bribes, the people he replaced them with would also be on the take. It suits him to say so because it deflects responsibility from him: after all, he has ruled the country on and off since 1969.

It is going to be devastating for the clothing and textile industry.\"</p> <p>Kazia Kantor, group finance director at Coats, said the cost of disposal could reach \u00a3150m - although the cash cost is likely to be up to \u00a350m.</p> <p>The group, she said, had al ready organised a re-financing with a consortium of banks, including HSBC and Standard Chartered, with a \u00a3160m facility on top of \u00a3100m outstanding borrowings.</p> <p>Analysts said the move was good news for Coats Viyella as the company had been carrying the contract side for the past four years.</p> <p>\"It is going to be a much safer and stronger business,\" said one. \"For some time now today's decision has been seen as almost inevitable.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for Marks &amp; Spencer said the retailer was surprised by the move and had set up a working party to discuss the implications.</p> <p>Coats also reported a drop in pre-tax profits yesterday, down to \u00a335.6m from \u00a351.8m, while sales had grown to \u00a3766m from \u00a3745m for the six months to June 30, 2000.</p> <p>Operating profit for the thread business was up to \u00a346.8m from \u00a330.8m last year, while contract clothing losses had doubled to \u00a38.5m.</p> <p>Shares in Coats slipped 1.75p to 48.25p as the markets closed last night.

      "bodyText": "Textile manufacturer Coats Viyella is cutting 1,900 jobs and has warned that a further 5,600 are under threat when it severs 70-year-old supply links with Marks &amp; Spencer. The company is shutting four factories in the Midlands and reducing staff at a further three bases after deciding to sell off its contract clothing arm and concentrate on the threads business. It admitted the future looked bleak for the division's 3,000 remaining British workers, based mainly in the Midlands, as well as 2,600 employed abroad unless a buyer can be found. Foreign bases operating under a cloud include factories in Morocco, Cambodia, Mauritius and Sri Lanka. Mike Hartley, Viyella division chief executive, said its hand had been forced by market pressures. \"This is a desperately sad day for the clothing division and its employees, but we have to face the economic truth.\" As well as the contract side, which is responsible for products such as Salon Rose and Autograph underwear, the company is also selling its home furnishings and branded clothing businesses. These two include brand names such as Dorma bed linen and Van Heusen and Peter England shirts. Unions said last night that M&amp;S must shoulder some of the blame after reports indicated they had called for further price cuts from both Coats and fellow supplier Dewhirst. Des Farrell, national secretary of the GMB's clothing and textiles division, said 50,000 industry jobs had been cut in the past 18 months and said he was pressing for emergency talks with both Coats and Trade Secretary Stephen Byers. \"I am annoyed as there's been no consultation from Coats Viyella,\" he said. \"They have built their reputation on the backs of British workers and this is totally unsatisfactory. It is going to be devastating for the clothing and textile industry.\" Kazia Kantor, group finance director at Coats, said the cost of disposal could reach \u00a3150m - although the cash cost is likely to be up to \u00a350m. The group, she said, had al ready organised a re-financing with a consortium of banks, including HSBC and Standard Chartered, with a \u00a3160m facility on top of \u00a3100m outstanding borrowings. Analysts said the move was good news for Coats Viyella as the company had been carrying the contract side for the past four years. \"It is going to be a much safer and stronger business,\" said one. \"For some time now today's decision has been seen as almost inevitable.\" A spokesman for Marks &amp; Spencer said the retailer was surprised by the move and had set up a working party to discuss the implications. Coats also reported a drop in pre-tax profits yesterday, down to \u00a335.6m from \u00a351.8m, while sales had grown to \u00a3766m from \u00a3745m for the six months to June 30, 2000. Operating profit for the thread business was up to \u00a346.8m from \u00a330.8m last year, while contract clothing losses had doubled to \u00a38.5m. Shares in Coats slipped 1.75p to 48.25p as the markets closed last night. This is some way adrift of its 63.5p year high, but ahead of its 36.5p low.",

      "bodyText": "France's fuel crisis deepened yesterday as the government warned that there would be \"no further negotiations\" with the road hauliers who are continuing their blockade of oil refineries and fuel depots throughout the country. With rationing, including a ban on filling jerrycans, now in force in more than 50 of France's 96 districts, there were long queues again outside the estimated 20% of petrol stations that had stocks left. Lionel Jospin's Socialist-led government is being increasingly criticised for its handling of the dispute, described by the Green party, which is a member of the coalition, as shortsighted. The latest protesters to join the hauliers, farmers, taxi drivers, ambulance companies and coach companies in demanding an urgent cut in French state fuel taxes were the barge owners who, along with a handful of sightseeing boats, blocked traffic on the river Seine outside the finance ministry yesterday. \"Like everyone else, we are being irreparably harmed by the rise in fuel prices,\" Bernard Baussart, head of the 1,000-strong independent barge-owners' association, said. \"This was never a secure profession and now we're seeing up to 20% of our profits disappear literally in smoke.\" After consulting members, the two leading road haulier's associations, FNTR and Unostra, rejected as \"wholly inadequate\" an overnight offer by the transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, of a backdated 3.5 pence rebate on every litre of fuel bought this year, plus a 2.5 pence a litre refund next year - an offer worth \u00a3100m a year. The hauliers said they would reinforce their blockade and warned that their members were \"more determined than ever\" to see the high fuel taxes cut to a level approaching the European Union norm. Only the union TLF, representing some large haulage firms, accepted the deal. Mr Jospin warned that the government \"would go no further\" and that there would be no further negotiations. Adding to the prime minister's woes, the main agricultural union, FNSEA, whose members are helping man about 50 of the 85 barricades maintained around refineries and depots for the past three days, said it wanted farmers to be exempted altogether from state fuel taxes. Ambulance and coach companies staged go-slows on main roads around several cities, including Paris, while the main taxi-driver's union announced a national day of action today. Fuel shortages began to bite at France's regional airports yesterday. Several planes flying into Lyon - including three international flights - were diverted to other airports because refuelling could not be guaranteed. Commentators, even on the left, said the government had exacerbated the crisis by trying to buy protesters off one by one rather than tackling the underlying problem. The escalating protests, which appear to have caught the Socialist party off guard, brought tension with its Green party colleagues. The Green party spokesman, Denis Baupin, accused the government of \"waiting until things degenerated and reacting, as usual, in the heat of the moment, offering concessions which run counter to the general interest\". The vice-president of the employers federation, Denis Kessler said: \"We have always considered it abnormal that most problems in our country degenerate into a show of force.\" \"Everyone tends to turn with their problems to the state, which is happy with that situation because it gets a lead role.\"",

      "bodyText": "Oil exporters came under public pressure from the European Union to boost production yesterday when France's fuel blockade showed signs of spreading to other countries hit by record pump prices. As the cost of the international benchmark, Brent crude, soared to a new peak of $33.50 a barrel, the European commission called for a stable price and indicated that EU finance ministers might act if the Opec meeting in Vienna on Sunday did not agree to increase production. President Bill Clinton was making a similar appeal in New York, where he was meeting Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia: the most influential member of the cartel. The prince has said he will work to stabilise oil prices but insists that consumer countries must cut their fuel taxes. In Brussels the EU energy commissioner, Loyola de Palacio, said she wanted producers to agree the \"common objective\" of working towards a stable price, suggesting that it should be $20 a barrel: way below current levels. She urged EU states to issue a formal statement stressing that they expected Opec to agree to \"a substantial increase in production.\" EU leaders are afraid that rising oil prices will increase inflation and slow down the recovery of the 11 countries in the eurozone. EU finance ministers, including the chancellor, Gordon Brown, are due to discuss the issue at Versailles at the weekend. But the commission warned too that the French government decision to cut fuel taxes for truckers, fishermen and farmers could be illegal if it distorted EU rules on competition and state subsidies. In London the Freight Transport Association (FTA) said the cuts would further hit the competitiveness of British industry, but added that it had no plans to follow the French example and organise mass protests. Analysts said they doubted that the extra 500,000 barrels a day additional production likely to be agreed by Opec on Sunday would be enough to meet the current high levels of demand in the US and Europe. There have been protests against the high cost of fuel by farmers, fishermen and truck and taxi drivers in Spain. Now the Spanish road haulage unions are demanding exemption from recently imposed taxes on hydrocarbon pollution. In Belgium, trade unions are calling on the government to reimburse the additional revenue of $200m that rising fuel prices have poured into its coffers.",

Troops of the former government admitted that they were in retreat. \"We pulled out of the city to avoid civilian casualties,\" Mohammed Abil, an opposition spokesman, said. \"Our forces are still on the city's outskirts.\" Many of the town's civilians fled in recent weeks as the fighting grew worse. The fall of Taloqan will strengthen the Taliban's demand for international diplomatic recognition, particularly during the current UN summit in New York. \"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan once again requests the Afghan seat at the United Nations,\" the Taliban's foreign ministry said in a statement last night. Although President Burhanuddin Rabbani's ousted government still holds Afghanistan's UN seat, his forces now control only one province, Badakshan, and small slices of territory in the north. Their military base, controlled by the former defence minister Ahmad Shah Masood, is in the Panjsher valley, 70 miles north of Kabul, where steep mountain walls have provided a solid defence since the Soviet occupation. But Taloqan lies on a crucial supply route linking the Panjsher with Tajikistan, which has provided considerable help to Commander Masood's forces. \"This means the loss of the supply route to the Panjsher valley and the opposition will find it now very difficult to get its supplies from outside,\" said Kamal Matinuddin, a retired Pakistani general and a writer on Afghanistan.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'People have always eaten people. What else is there to eat? If the Juju had meant us not to eat people, he wouldn't have made us of meat!\" So explains the exasperated father to his idealistic son in Michael Flanders and Donald Swann's revue skit from the 1950s, The Reluctant Cannibal. The teenage self-righteousness of the son (\"Eating People is Wrong!\" is his insistent protest) contrasts with the world-weariness of the father, at a loss to explain his son's sudden extremism (\"To think, he used to be a regular anthropha-guy\") while maintaining his station in the tribe (\"Me! Chief Assistant to the Assistant Chief!\"). The appeal of Flanders and Swann's satire lies in its portrayal of cannibalism as something that only na\u00efve teenagers might find totally abhorrent - global capitalism, say - when to jaded grown-ups it is just the way of the world. </p> <p>The irony is that to many people throughout history, cannibalism was the way of the world. Contemporary western horror of eating people could be an aberration, and has a lot to answer for in the world of anthropology, which is a western creation. Evidence for cannibalism abounds - even if circumstantial - both from the modern world and throughout history, but academic anthropology has found itself in a funk of denial. This explains why Richard A Marlar of the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver and his colleagues have gone to great lengths to substantiate a case of cannibalism from the western United States. </p> <p>Writing in today's Nature, Marlar and colleagues examine what happened at an archaeological site called Cowboy Wash, in southwestern Colorado when, sometime around AD 1150, a small settlement was suddenly abandoned. At around the time of the desertion of Cowboy Wash, seven people of various ages and both sexes were killed, dismembered and cooked. Signs of butchery are evident, and traces of human blood remain on implements found in the remains of the houses, even after 850 years. Cooking pots contain traces of human myoglobin, a protein only found in skeletal and heart muscle - in other words, meat. The researchers have published many of these findings in report after voluminous report, alleging that they have stumbled on nothing less than a cannibal feast - to deluges of denial. Signs of butchery, even cookery, do not necessarily mean human ingestion, claim critics. </p> <p>The researchers provide the clincher in their Nature report.

      "bodyText": "'People have always eaten people. What else is there to eat? If the Juju had meant us not to eat people, he wouldn't have made us of meat!\" So explains the exasperated father to his idealistic son in Michael Flanders and Donald Swann's revue skit from the 1950s, The Reluctant Cannibal. The teenage self-righteousness of the son (\"Eating People is Wrong!\" is his insistent protest) contrasts with the world-weariness of the father, at a loss to explain his son's sudden extremism (\"To think, he used to be a regular anthropha-guy\") while maintaining his station in the tribe (\"Me! Chief Assistant to the Assistant Chief!\"). The appeal of Flanders and Swann's satire lies in its portrayal of cannibalism as something that only na\u00efve teenagers might find totally abhorrent - global capitalism, say - when to jaded grown-ups it is just the way of the world. The irony is that to many people throughout history, cannibalism was the way of the world. Contemporary western horror of eating people could be an aberration, and has a lot to answer for in the world of anthropology, which is a western creation. Evidence for cannibalism abounds - even if circumstantial - both from the modern world and throughout history, but academic anthropology has found itself in a funk of denial. This explains why Richard A Marlar of the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver and his colleagues have gone to great lengths to substantiate a case of cannibalism from the western United States. Writing in today's Nature, Marlar and colleagues examine what happened at an archaeological site called Cowboy Wash, in southwestern Colorado when, sometime around AD 1150, a small settlement was suddenly abandoned. At around the time of the desertion of Cowboy Wash, seven people of various ages and both sexes were killed, dismembered and cooked. Signs of butchery are evident, and traces of human blood remain on implements found in the remains of the houses, even after 850 years. Cooking pots contain traces of human myoglobin, a protein only found in skeletal and heart muscle - in other words, meat. The researchers have published many of these findings in report after voluminous report, alleging that they have stumbled on nothing less than a cannibal feast - to deluges of denial. Signs of butchery, even cookery, do not necessarily mean human ingestion, claim critics. The researchers provide the clincher in their Nature report. The evidence that challenges the scepticism is humble enough: just before leaving, one of the diners at the grisly occasion left a small deposit on the cooling hearth. This coprolite ( the technical term for palaeo-poo) has yielded much to modern scrutiny. First, it is completely devoid of plant matter, including the corn and other plants that the Anasazi Pueblo people of the region lived on.

The reason is probably what Darwin called female choice - females tend to breed with the males who sing, and who sing loudest and longest. </p> <p>But Darwin's solution replaces one puzzle with another. Why did females ever evolve to choose males who do such crazy things? That is a harder question, and one that has not yet been fully answered. But part of the answer is going to be that courting animals (and human animals perhaps) are assessing gene quality. We have known for ages that copying accidents -mutations - happen in the genes. What had not been known, until the recent boom in the gene sequencing industry, is the sheer number of mutations. </p> <p>A human being makes 200 or so copying mistakes every time he or she breeds. This is a big number, making it something of a mystery how we can cope. If that number of mutations are introduced each generation, a similar number must somehow be purged. Otherwise our genes would be steadily randomised over time by mutation, and a random set of genes can no more code for a living creature than a random series of letters can code for a Shakespeare play. The mating market does some of the purging. An individual faces two problems when trying to assess the gene quality of another individual. One is how to tell which suitors have good genes, and which have bad. The number of bad genes is not written on an individuals' forehead. Nor can courting couples directly inspect each other's DNA codes and check them for defects. They are in much the same position as someone who wants to buy a second-hand car, and lacks the skills needed to test its components directly. All you can do is take it out for a test drive, and assess its quality from how well it goes. </p> <p>Being courted is a \"proactive\" experience. The second problem is that, during courtship, you are accompanied by the equivalent of a smooth-talking salesperson. A car salesperson will know more about the car than you do and wants to sell it, independently of its quality. Similarly, a courting male may privately be aware of some of his defects but his interest is closure, not candour. </p> <p>The salesperson can also act to conceal defects in the car. If the car is one that gasps and wheezes at high speeds, he can point out that there are roadworks on the motorway today and it would probably be better to avoid it. A male who has managed to survive may have done so by having good genes, or by having poor genes and looking after himself. Ideally you need to take him out and rev up every component, one by one and in combination, to test for defects; but that is an exhausting job in a 60,000-gene life-form. </p> <p>One idea about courtship in life is that it has been shaped during evolution to solve these problems. It allows a fast assessment of gene quality, and in a way that is not open to deception. Indeed it has been shown that courtship works this way in frogs, butterflies, birds, and some bizarre stalk-eyed flies. Evolution has ensured that a male with accurately copied genes can grow the tail, or dance the dance, or sing the song, whereas a male with corrupt genes cannot so well. It is as if you could assess the quality of a car simply by a ritual display in the showroom. For humans, we have no such conclusive experimental evidence - and never can have. But we do have a good hint that the same process goes on in us. It comes from the death rates of single and married people. </p> <p>The evidence was collected in the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries when breeding was mainly done by married couples. Single men are about 1.8 times as likely to die as comparable married men; single women are about 1.5 times as likely to die as comparable married women. Much the same effect has been found in Europe, America, and Asia. In the evidence we have, being single is one of the biggest risk factors in human life. If you look at a list of the big risk factors for human beings, the top ones in the list are being old, being poor, being male and being single. Being single is about as bad as being male, or poor; it is actuarially equivalent to smoking about a pack of cigarettes per day. </p> <p>What is going on? Two things are probably going on. One does not matter here, and it is that marriage itself may improve your health. The other is that health may improve your marriageability. People with poor health are discriminated against in the marriage market, and the class of single people are the unhealthy leftovers. There is a nationalist joke, which is told in many neighbouring countries around the world. I first heard it from a Scot, in England: \"whenever a Scot crosses the border into England, the average intelligence of both countries goes up.\" It looks as if, whenever a single person marries, the average health of both the single and the married class goes down. In so far as there is a genetic component to health the difference between the mortalities of single and married people suggests that bad genes get snubbed in our marriage markets. </p> <p>Life is 4,000 million years old and it has evolved a series of mechanisms to cope with gene copying error. In the beginning there was natural selection, which killed off mutations. By 3,000 million years ago our ancestors had added a set of molecular mechanisms to proof-read and repair their genes. By 2,000 million years ago they had sexual reproduction, rather than cloning, and that revved up the purge of copying mistakes. Maybe 1,000 million years ago our ancestors reached the last stage in the fight against genetic error. By then, they had gender and life evolved the ability to detect gene quality. The purge of bad genes grew more efficient, as a new stage of female quality control was added before each new generation of machines was run off the genetic assembly lines. </p> <p> \u0095 Mark Ridley's new book Mendel's Demon: Gene Justice and the Complexity of Life is published this week by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson.</p>",

This summer, at Fermilab near Chicago, after surveying six million images of collisions between subatomic particles, four precious examples of the tau-neutrino have finally been found. </p> <p>What is it and why does it matter? </p> <p>The first person to imagine that neutrinos could exist was Wolfgang Pauli in 1930. When a neutron transformed into a proton and electron in \"beta\" decay, Pauli noticed that some energy and momentum seemed to vanish: the sum of energy and momentum after the decay event did not equal what had been there to start with. This threatened sacred conservation principles that are central to physics: energy and momentum do not simply \"disappear\". If you know where to look, you should be able to balance the books. </p> <p>Pauli suggested that the neutrino - a nearly invisible particle - was also being produced along with the electron and proton in the process, and that this neutrino was carrying away the \"missing\" energy. He described his idea as a \"desperate remedy\" to this daunting problem. A quarter of a century passed before Clyde Cowan and Fred Reines in 1956 captured direct proof that the neutrino exists. In the subsequent half century, a lot was learned about them. </p> <p>Neutrinos have played a major role establishing the \"standard model of particles and forces. In this modern picture of the universe, matter consists of a simple set of particles in triplicate. The up and down quarks, which are the seeds of all atomic nuclei, are each tripled: thus the down quark has two heavier cousins known as strange and bottom, while the up has a heavier pair known as \"charm\" and \"top\". There are thus six quarks in all. At the periphery of atoms we find electrons. </p> <p>The electron has two auxiliary versions known as muon and tau. To complete this symmetry we expect that there are three varieties of neutrino. One is a sibling of the electron, and is known as the electron-neutrino; it is this form of neutrino that Pauli had successfully predicted. The other two are siblings of the muon and tau and are dubbed \"muon-neutrino\" and \"tau-neutrino\". As these are mouthfuls, physicists refer to them as \"nu-e\", \"nu-mu\" and \"nu-tau\". </p> <p>After decades of intensive experiments physicists had become so certain of the standard model that they often forgot that there was only circumstantial evidence for the nu-tau. Experiments at CERN had shown that certain sums only balanced if three varieties of neutrino exist, and hence by implication that the nu-tau was around, but this was not a \"direct sighting\". It was analogous to Pauli having proposed the existence of the nu-e in order to balance the energy account. However, seeing the nu-tau directly, analogous to what Cowan and Reines had achieved 50 years earlier with the nu-e, remained to be done. </p> <p>Detecting neutrinos is like \"seeing\" H G Wells' invisible man. He gave himself away by jostling the crowd. This is how the scientists caught sight of the nu-tau. </p> <p>At Fermilab, the powerful particle accelerator near Chicago, making beams of neutrinos is standard fare. These beams contain many nu-e and nu-mu and also, according to theory, some nu-taus. The scientists built a metre-long target of iron plates In the direct line of the neutrino beam. The iron plates are like sandwiches consisting of thin stacks of emulsion between successive layers of iron. The emulsion is like a sophisticated photographic plate which records the particle interactions. </p> <p>Isolating a nu-tau is harder than finding the proverbial needle in the haystack. Only one out of every million million tau neutrinos hit an iron nucleus on target. The effect of this collision is to turn the invisible nu-tau into its sibling, the tau particle. The main signature of a tau is a track with a characteristic kink, indicating its formation and almost instant death. The appearance of the tau is like the visible crowd being moved when the invisible (nu-tau) hit one of them. </p> <p>The team had named their experiment \"Donut\" - Direct Observation of Nu-Tau. When the emulsions were processed, billions of trails would be revealed. Hopefully among these there would be a handful of slivers that would reveal taus, and in turn the influence of the nu-tau. The computer surveys of the emulsion images initially identified 6m potential candidates. However, there are many things other than the nu-tau that leave trails and these had to be removed one by one. By analysing signals from various components of the 50-foot long detector, they winnowed out all but 100 of these candidates. When all of these had been thoroughly examined, a precious four provided definitive evidence for the tau neutrino. </p> <p>In the coming months further examples will be found and soon the character of this most ephemeral of all particles will become clear. In the opinion of Martin Perl, who won the Nobel Prize for his discovery in 1975 of the tau, the particle that is now being used to signal the nu-tau, \"this opens a whole new world. There is the possibility that the tau neu trino behaves somewhat differently from the other neutrinos\". This is the challenge. There is some profound reason why the basic seeds of matter that forms us today are insufficient for nature's scheme; nature has tripled its basic members. Having at last learned how to isolate all of them, we can now hope to find out why it is that the material universe was designed this way. </p> <p>\u0095 Professor Frank Close will speak at the Creating Sparks festival in London today and sign copies of his book Lucifer's Legacy (Oxford)</p>",

At Fermilab, the powerful particle accelerator near Chicago, making beams of neutrinos is standard fare. These beams contain many nu-e and nu-mu and also, according to theory, some nu-taus. The scientists built a metre-long target of iron plates In the direct line of the neutrino beam. The iron plates are like sandwiches consisting of thin stacks of emulsion between successive layers of iron. The emulsion is like a sophisticated photographic plate which records the particle interactions. Isolating a nu-tau is harder than finding the proverbial needle in the haystack. Only one out of every million million tau neutrinos hit an iron nucleus on target. The effect of this collision is to turn the invisible nu-tau into its sibling, the tau particle. The main signature of a tau is a track with a characteristic kink, indicating its formation and almost instant death. The appearance of the tau is like the visible crowd being moved when the invisible (nu-tau) hit one of them. The team had named their experiment \"Donut\" - Direct Observation of Nu-Tau. When the emulsions were processed, billions of trails would be revealed. Hopefully among these there would be a handful of slivers that would reveal taus, and in turn the influence of the nu-tau. The computer surveys of the emulsion images initially identified 6m potential candidates. However, there are many things other than the nu-tau that leave trails and these had to be removed one by one. By analysing signals from various components of the 50-foot long detector, they winnowed out all but 100 of these candidates. When all of these had been thoroughly examined, a precious four provided definitive evidence for the tau neutrino. In the coming months further examples will be found and soon the character of this most ephemeral of all particles will become clear. In the opinion of Martin Perl, who won the Nobel Prize for his discovery in 1975 of the tau, the particle that is now being used to signal the nu-tau, \"this opens a whole new world. There is the possibility that the tau neu trino behaves somewhat differently from the other neutrinos\". This is the challenge. There is some profound reason why the basic seeds of matter that forms us today are insufficient for nature's scheme; nature has tripled its basic members. Having at last learned how to isolate all of them, we can now hope to find out why it is that the material universe was designed this way. \u0095 Professor Frank Close will speak at the Creating Sparks festival in London today and sign copies of his book Lucifer's Legacy (Oxford)",

      "body": "<p>Josh Brandon has, he explains, carried out a detailed marketing analysis and chosen the perfect site for his new start-up business in the heart of the dot.com capital of the world. So far his financial returns have exceeded predictions and overheads have been kept low. He is optimistic about the future and foresees, like many others in the SoMa (south of Market Street) district of San Francisco, steady growth. </p> <p>But there is one crucial difference between the busy young dot.comers hurrying to work this morning with their take-away lattes in their hand and Josh Brandon. While the former will head at night for their loft homes or the Mission cocktail bars, Brandon will be spending the night on a mattress under the Bay Bridge. Brandon is a panhandler, a word with a more defiant feel to it than the more literal beggar: he is one of a vast army who now populate the centre of San Francisco as the city experiences the boom of the dot.com world. Estimates vary on how many thousand now live rough and hustle on the street but everyone would agree that they are now as much a feature of the city as the cable car and the Golden Gate bridge. </p> <p>\"I've been drifting off shore for quite a while now,\" says Brandon who explains, rather chillingly, that he used to be a journalist. \"But I feel as though I'm swimming towards land.\" Originally from Olympia in Washington state, he had worked for a while for the San Francisco community paper the Tenderloin Times and then for the department of public health. But he had been laid off, the residential hotel where he stayed had been burned out, and since last year he had been living with his \"troll-mates\" under the Bay Bridge in a spot where neither the highway police nor the transit authorities could find him. Now he stands with a nearly empty cardboard coffee container hoping some of the dot.com millions will trickle down his way. </p> <p>\"A lot of the young dot.com workers are very generous and sympathetic,\" he says. \"I never ask for money, I just greet people and I have this game I play with them where I try and guess what their occupation is.\" In the SoMa area, guessing that the passers-by are dot.comers is a pretty safe bet. His afternoon patch, outside the Museum of Modern Art is less productive. \"The ones that come to the (e-commerce) conventions are the worst, they're not a good crowd.\" </p> <p>\"I did some kind of business and marketing analysis before I moved here,\" says Brandon, who is 51 and dressed in battered leather jacket, baseball cap and jeans. \"It's a question of location. location, location. I make about the minimum wage of $5 an hour if I'm lucky. I've been told by other pan-handlers that I'm doing well. Occasionally you get what we call \"blessed\" - someone drops a big bill, $20, $10 - but that rarely happens.\" </p> <p>\"Hungry. Anything helps. Thank you,\" says Philip's hand-written sign. Dressed in a ripped donkey jacket and with flowing dreadlocks, Philip is also very conscious that he lives in the capital of e-commerce. \"I use e-mail all the time,\" he says. \"A lot of people thinks it's odd that a homeless person has an e-mail address but that's how we all keep in touch with each other.\" He is able to use the computer at the library to receive and send his messages before he settles down at his patch outside Borders bookshop near Union Square. Philip is a sweet-faced 20-year-old high school drop-out from Spokane, Washington, whose home is a sleeping-bag under a bridge in Portrero Hill. Kicked out of his home, he says, by a step-father at 12 he has hitch-hiked and jumped trains across the country for the last few years. He has been on the street in San Francisco for a year but hopes that - thanks to a friendly young web site designer who took pity on him and helped him make his own site - he might find work one day in the industry that has made millionaires of young men his age. </p> <p>\"My passion is artwork and writing and now I can make a basic website. If I can get on to a multi-media studies course I might be able to find work,\" he said. \"Nine out of 10 people ignore me completely but I'm pretty numb to it. I've only had one person kick my sign but my friend has been spat at. I don't think I'd take that.\" </p> <p>His mother was worried about him, of course, but he sent her art works and kept in touch by email. His most generous clients? \"No, it's not all the people who've made money here. It's usually people who are poor or have been in the same position.\" Male panhandlers heavily outnumber women, he said, although he had a woman friend who lived under the freeway. The highlight of his day, he said, would be to be able to have a coffee or tea and a read - he had a copy of Clive Barker's Weaveworld in his tattered bag - in the Baghdad Cafe. \"I live on tea, and if I have enough money some granola.\" </p> <p>Playing the flute nearby and soliciting donations in a Drum tobacco tin is a musician from Atlanta who introduces himself as Sir Rico Diablo. \"I went to college,\" he says with a smile. \"I even graduated out of computer school and I look at Silicon Valley and what's happening there, but I've been a wild person all my life and I love the streets.\" Now 50, he had played in a band for 15 years, he said, before hitting the streets and playing \"everything from Mozart to country and western. </p> <p>\"I live everywhere now - like an angel. I know that a lot of people make a lot of money here so I call myself International Panhandling Inc. A good day for me is $15.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the most appropriate tune for Sir Rico, Philip and Josh would be one written in 1932 by Yip Harburg, called Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? Years later Harburg told the writer Studs Terkel why he wrote it: \"in the song the man is really saying: 'I made an investment in this country. Where the hell are my dividends?'_ It's more than just a bit of pathos. It doesn't reduce him to a beggar, it makes him a dignified human, asking questions - and a bit outraged too. As he should be.\"</p>",

Estimates vary on how many thousand now live rough and hustle on the street but everyone would agree that they are now as much a feature of the city as the cable car and the Golden Gate bridge. \"I've been drifting off shore for quite a while now,\" says Brandon who explains, rather chillingly, that he used to be a journalist. \"But I feel as though I'm swimming towards land.\" Originally from Olympia in Washington state, he had worked for a while for the San Francisco community paper the Tenderloin Times and then for the department of public health. But he had been laid off, the residential hotel where he stayed had been burned out, and since last year he had been living with his \"troll-mates\" under the Bay Bridge in a spot where neither the highway police nor the transit authorities could find him. Now he stands with a nearly empty cardboard coffee container hoping some of the dot.com millions will trickle down his way. \"A lot of the young dot.com workers are very generous and sympathetic,\" he says. \"I never ask for money, I just greet people and I have this game I play with them where I try and guess what their occupation is.\" In the SoMa area, guessing that the passers-by are dot.comers is a pretty safe bet. His afternoon patch, outside the Museum of Modern Art is less productive. \"The ones that come to the (e-commerce) conventions are the worst, they're not a good crowd.\" \"I did some kind of business and marketing analysis before I moved here,\" says Brandon, who is 51 and dressed in battered leather jacket, baseball cap and jeans. \"It's a question of location. location, location. I make about the minimum wage of $5 an hour if I'm lucky. I've been told by other pan-handlers that I'm doing well. Occasionally you get what we call \"blessed\" - someone drops a big bill, $20, $10 - but that rarely happens.\" \"Hungry. Anything helps. Thank you,\" says Philip's hand-written sign. Dressed in a ripped donkey jacket and with flowing dreadlocks, Philip is also very conscious that he lives in the capital of e-commerce. \"I use e-mail all the time,\" he says. \"A lot of people thinks it's odd that a homeless person has an e-mail address but that's how we all keep in touch with each other.\" He is able to use the computer at the library to receive and send his messages before he settles down at his patch outside Borders bookshop near Union Square. Philip is a sweet-faced 20-year-old high school drop-out from Spokane, Washington, whose home is a sleeping-bag under a bridge in Portrero Hill. Kicked out of his home, he says, by a step-father at 12 he has hitch-hiked and jumped trains across the country for the last few years. He has been on the street in San Francisco for a year but hopes that - thanks to a friendly young web site designer who took pity on him and helped him make his own site - he might find work one day in the industry that has made millionaires of young men his age. \"My passion is artwork and writing and now I can make a basic website. If I can get on to a multi-media studies course I might be able to find work,\" he said. \"Nine out of 10 people ignore me completely but I'm pretty numb to it. I've only had one person kick my sign but my friend has been spat at. I don't think I'd take that.\" His mother was worried about him, of course, but he sent her art works and kept in touch by email. His most generous clients? \"No, it's not all the people who've made money here. It's usually people who are poor or have been in the same position.\" Male panhandlers heavily outnumber women, he said, although he had a woman friend who lived under the freeway. The highlight of his day, he said, would be to be able to have a coffee or tea and a read - he had a copy of Clive Barker's Weaveworld in his tattered bag - in the Baghdad Cafe. \"I live on tea, and if I have enough money some granola.\" Playing the flute nearby and soliciting donations in a Drum tobacco tin is a musician from Atlanta who introduces himself as Sir Rico Diablo. \"I went to college,\" he says with a smile. \"I even graduated out of computer school and I look at Silicon Valley and what's happening there, but I've been a wild person all my life and I love the streets.\" Now 50, he had played in a band for 15 years, he said, before hitting the streets and playing \"everything from Mozart to country and western. \"I live everywhere now - like an angel. I know that a lot of people make a lot of money here so I call myself International Panhandling Inc. A good day for me is $15.\" Perhaps the most appropriate tune for Sir Rico, Philip and Josh would be one written in 1932 by Yip Harburg, called Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? Years later Harburg told the writer Studs Terkel why he wrote it: \"in the song the man is really saying: 'I made an investment in this country. Where the hell are my dividends?'_ It's more than just a bit of pathos. It doesn't reduce him to a beggar, it makes him a dignified human, asking questions - and a bit outraged too. As he should be.\"",

      "body": "<p>The games industry is in a slump, and the European Computer Trade Show, held at Olympia over the weekend, was the dullest event for years. But the future looks good. Nintendo sent Shigeru Miyamoto, its Japanese superstar game designer, to show off its next generation Gamecube, Sony mounted a huge display around the PlayStation 2, and Microsoft had its two top games gurus rounding up developers to work for the forthcoming Xbox games console. </p> <p>The games console business is cyclical, and everyone expects a boom to follow the bust. In fact, Ray Maguire, UK managing director of Sony Computer Entertainment, says he expects the business to come back bigger than ever, as it has following previous turns of the technology wheel. </p> <p>Gaming is evolving from a niche market to a mainstream activity, \"blending computer technology, DVD and music into one experience,\" he explains. \"That's where we're going with the PlayStation 2.\" </p> <p>David Gardner, managing director of Electronic Arts Europe, agrees that the PS2's ability to deliver close-to-TV-quality graphics should make the games industry \"bigger than it has ever been, because you don't have to imagine it, you can see it. That's the big win we've been waiting 20 years for, and it's finally coming this Christmas.\" </p> <p>The problem is that it's not here yet, so gamers are less keen to buy current machines that may have a limited life-span, and they want to pay lower prices for the games that run on them. This has reduced the games industry's income, and led to the current trough. </p> <p>But while owners of next-generation consoles will no doubt be prepared to pay high prices for great new games, it will take years before there are enough of them to replace more than 70 million Play-Station owners, and more than 100 million Game Boy owners. Transitions take time. </p> <p>Things will start to change on November 24, when Sony ships the PS2 in the UK, but Microsoft's Xbox is not due for another year, even if it arrives on schedule. (Both console hardware and Microsoft software are usually late, so I wouldn't bet on Microsoft shipping a console on time.) </p> <p>Nintendo's Gamecube, code-named Dolphin, may be even later. It is expected to go on sale in Japan in March, and in the US in October 2001, but UK buyers will probably have to wait until 2002. </p> <p>Worse, even the arrival of the PlayStation 2 may not give the software business the fillip it needs. Reports from Japan suggest that sales of PS2 games are relatively low, either because Japanese buyers are using their consoles as DVD movie players, or because the first games have been lacklustre. It normally takes at least 18 months to develop a great game, and the PS2 is reputedly very hard to program, so some software houses may have cut corners in the rush to market. </p> <p>Either way, the PS2's problems have given Sony's rivals angles for attack. </p> <p>In London on Saturday, Nintendo's Miyamoto - the creator of Mario, Zelda and other characters - argued that the Gamecube was a better platform. \"We software people have been fooled in the past by claims from the hardware people\" who don't deliver what they promise, he said. </p> <p>The Gamecube, however, \"is compatible with creating games: it's close to be being the ideal piece of hardware.\" Microsoft's primary strategy is to beat the PS2 with better technology, and Peter Molyneux, Britain's leading games designer, says: \"the Xbox is unquestionably the most powerful of the next generation machines.\" But Microsoft is also stressing that it is by far the easiest to program, because the base technology - 733MHz Intel processor, Nvidia NV20-equivalent graphics chip, a stripped down version of Microsoft Windows 2000, DirectX 8 multimedia interface, hard drive, DVD player is already familiar. </p> <p>Ed Fries, vice president in charge of Microsoft's games software division in Seattle, tells programmers: \"You don't have to wait for an Xbox, you can start on a PC today.\" </p> <p>Also, unlike their PS2 equivalents, PC programming tools are very highly developed, and millions of programmers already know how to use them. </p> <p>Both Sony and Microsoft recognise that they are on a collision course, but neither seems too concerned, and Molyneux says the competition will be good for consumers. Separately both Sony and Microsoft seem to agree. </p> <p>Maguire says that Microsoft and Nintendo putting \"more energy into the marketplace\" will increase interest in gaming, \"so in one way they'll take market share, but they'll help grow a bigger market overall.\" </p> <p>J Allard, general manager in charge of the Xbox project in Seattle, says: \"We're going after the same market [as the PS2], and we're going to spend a ton of money, and we're going to have games that nobody's ever seen before, and raise the bar in the industry. Collectively we're going to grow this category significantly,\" he says, \"as every generation of new consoles has done.\" </p> <p>I ask Allard if the success of the Xbox will undermine the market for PC games. This is important, because the PC leisure software market in Europe is bigger than the games console software market - by $3,067m to $2,708m last year, according to research just published by Screen Digest and the European Leisure Software Association (Elspa). </p> <p>\"I think there are fundamental differences between PC games and console games,\" he replies. Allard says he associates words such as realism, solitary, and cerebral with PC games. \"Age of Empires is much more thought-provoking than any console game.\" The words he associates with console games include approachable, social, and action. \"With consoles, the rapid reward system is much more critical than the depth,\" he continues. \"Console games have been more like comic books, and PC games have been more like the Iliad. That requires a little more thought, and if you don't read the whole thing you're not going to get it.\" </p> <p>This, of course, reflects Microsoft's approach to developers. Both Allard and Fries are insisting that Xbox games must be designed for the console, not just carted over from the PC. But Allard is well aware the differences are blurred, and sees the potential benefit. </p> <p>\"We have a wonderful opportunity to take the depth of PC games and the approachability of console games and create new forms of entertainment. I think that of the bulk of Xbox games 85% will be just like other console games, but done better. But maybe 15% will have deeper content that takes us to a whole new level,\" he says. </p> <p>Others are already seeing a whole new level: it's called the internet. That's where Sega has staked its claim, by including a modem with its Dreamcast console, and by launching an online service, Dreamarena. This enables Dreamcast owners to play online games and send electronic mail. </p> <p>It also allows Sega to think about changing the way it makes money from games: perhaps it could charge for online play-time instead of for disc-based software that is subject to piracy and theft. </p> <p>Sega's problem is that the internet has yet to arrive as a mass market for pay-to-play services, and the services that do exist are dominated by PCs. The Dreamcast may be able to get online, but it provides a relatively poor internet experience, partly because of the low resolution of TV screens that cannot display websites with anything like the quality of a computer monitor. The further worry is that some users may think Sega is deserting its core Dreamcast business - console gaming - when the online arena cannot generate equivalent revenues. </p> <p>Sony's ambitions for the PS2 are also well known: it is intended to become a well-connected home entertainment centre. But as Gardner points out: \"Right now, the games consoles don't have the sophistication of PCs for online use, so the PC market will continue to grow.\" </p> <p>Right now, EA's most successful online gaming service, <a href=\"http://www.uo.com/\" target=\"_new\">Ultima Online</a>, is based on the PC. Even J Allard - who was the first Microsoft employee to run a server on the net, and who registered <a href=\"http://www.Microsoft.com\" target=\"_new\">Microsoft.com</a> - thinks the time is not ripe. He's launching a console using the tried and trusted methods developed by Atari and other companies 20 years ago, and that have been most successfully copied by Sony. As he'd told me at the Xbox's unveiling in March: \"We are not confused: this is a single-function device entirely focused on the games market. We have to focus on creating great games.\" </p> <p>In the long term, however, Allard says: \"the internet is ultra-important, it's critical.\" He describes how frustrated he became when catching up with his email on the plane to London, because so many messages included links to websites: \"it drove me crazy that I wasn't connected.\" </p> <p>That would not have been the case four or five years ago, and Allard reckons that eventually \"the same thing will be true of gaming. As soon as people subscribe to the Metal Gear Solid Mission of the Week, and everyone is talking about last night's mission, they'll never be satisfied with last year's static, standalone, disconnected game again. </p> <p>\"It's just a question of when that time will come. I think the Xbox platform is best suited to catalyse that shift, and I think we'll be instrumental in leading that charge,\" says Allard. \"Are we pinning the success of Xbox on that? Absolutely not. Do we think gaming is going to go that way and never look back? You bet.\" </p> <p>One of the interesting things about the cycles of the console industry, with its regular peaks and troughs, is that so far every generation has brought a different company to the top. Thus Atari (VCS) was followed by Nintendo (NES), Sega (MegaDrive/Genesis) and then Sony (PlayStation). </p> <p>Sony must be the bookies' favourite to break the pattern and win two rounds in a row. But look ahead to the next cycle, where Microsoft's strength on the internet could tip the balance, and there might be a new champion. It's not Game Over yet.</p>",

But Allard is well aware the differences are blurred, and sees the potential benefit. \"We have a wonderful opportunity to take the depth of PC games and the approachability of console games and create new forms of entertainment. I think that of the bulk of Xbox games 85% will be just like other console games, but done better. But maybe 15% will have deeper content that takes us to a whole new level,\" he says. Others are already seeing a whole new level: it's called the internet. That's where Sega has staked its claim, by including a modem with its Dreamcast console, and by launching an online service, Dreamarena. This enables Dreamcast owners to play online games and send electronic mail. It also allows Sega to think about changing the way it makes money from games: perhaps it could charge for online play-time instead of for disc-based software that is subject to piracy and theft. Sega's problem is that the internet has yet to arrive as a mass market for pay-to-play services, and the services that do exist are dominated by PCs. The Dreamcast may be able to get online, but it provides a relatively poor internet experience, partly because of the low resolution of TV screens that cannot display websites with anything like the quality of a computer monitor. The further worry is that some users may think Sega is deserting its core Dreamcast business - console gaming - when the online arena cannot generate equivalent revenues. Sony's ambitions for the PS2 are also well known: it is intended to become a well-connected home entertainment centre. But as Gardner points out: \"Right now, the games consoles don't have the sophistication of PCs for online use, so the PC market will continue to grow.\" Right now, EA's most successful online gaming service, Ultima Online, is based on the PC. Even J Allard - who was the first Microsoft employee to run a server on the net, and who registered Microsoft.com - thinks the time is not ripe. He's launching a console using the tried and trusted methods developed by Atari and other companies 20 years ago, and that have been most successfully copied by Sony. As he'd told me at the Xbox's unveiling in March: \"We are not confused: this is a single-function device entirely focused on the games market. We have to focus on creating great games.\" In the long term, however, Allard says: \"the internet is ultra-important, it's critical.\" He describes how frustrated he became when catching up with his email on the plane to London, because so many messages included links to websites: \"it drove me crazy that I wasn't connected.\" That would not have been the case four or five years ago, and Allard reckons that eventually \"the same thing will be true of gaming. As soon as people subscribe to the Metal Gear Solid Mission of the Week, and everyone is talking about last night's mission, they'll never be satisfied with last year's static, standalone, disconnected game again. \"It's just a question of when that time will come. I think the Xbox platform is best suited to catalyse that shift, and I think we'll be instrumental in leading that charge,\" says Allard. \"Are we pinning the success of Xbox on that? Absolutely not. Do we think gaming is going to go that way and never look back? You bet.\" One of the interesting things about the cycles of the console industry, with its regular peaks and troughs, is that so far every generation has brought a different company to the top. Thus Atari (VCS) was followed by Nintendo (NES), Sega (MegaDrive/Genesis) and then Sony (PlayStation). Sony must be the bookies' favourite to break the pattern and win two rounds in a row. But look ahead to the next cycle, where Microsoft's strength on the internet could tip the balance, and there might be a new champion. It's not Game Over yet.",
