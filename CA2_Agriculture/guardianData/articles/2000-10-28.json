Friends and supporters of James's family want celebrities and famous faces to back an event to raise money for an appeal against the release of the boys. The gala event is being organised by the pressure group Mothers Against Murder and Aggression, which announced plans for the show after it emerged that the murdered toddler's father, Ralph Bulger, had been denied legal aid for an appeal. Cash raised would also help relatives of other murder victims, the group said. James was beaten to death on a railway line in Liverpool in 1993 by Venables and Thompson, who were then aged 10. They had abducted him from the Strand shopping centre in Bootle while he was out with his mother. A High Court ruling last week by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Woolf, effectively ended the tariff setting the minimum sentence which the pair must serve.

He set an eight-year tariff which means they could be eligible for release on 21 February, 2001. Solicitor Robin Makin, who acts for James's father, was dismayed: 'They still haven't apologised to Mr Bulger or his family. It seems they are being reinvented rather than rehabilitated.' The ruling took into consideration the extent to which the boys are believed to have been rehabilitated and the continuation of this process. The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Simon Hughes, said: 'Children who commit offences, however terrible, should always have a chance of a new start once they are adults.' The Parole Board will now have to decide whether the teenagers still present a risk and whether they are suitable for release.

      "body": "<p>Glasgow, 3.30pm on Thursday. Preceded by a gentle, recorded harp strum, the cheerful conductor welcomed passengers aboard Virgin Train's 15.38 Glasgow Central to London Euston service with good news. Against all the odds, the train was prepared and would depart from Platform 1 on time.</p> <p>We passengers, who had arrived braced for unhappy tidings, settled back in our seats, picked up our newspapers and smugly congratulated ourselves on our uncanny ability to sidestep the near-paralysis to which Britain's crumbling rail network had been reduced last week.</p> <p>At 3.39pm, another tinny harp strum. This time, the conductor said, there had been a slight hiccough: there was no driver. Through every carriage swept the resigned groan of travellers. 'We'll be on our way as soon as we find him,' the Tannoy voice added half-heartedly.</p> <p>It was 40 minutes before the driver appeared for duty. Before it had left the platform in Glasgow, the service was almost an hour behind the timetable. This was an inauspicious start. There was worse to come.</p> <p>This weekend the rail network is undergoing its biggest repair programme for more than a century. More than 20,000 Railtrack staff are working to repair 41,000 metres of rail identified as unsafe in the wake of the Hatfield derailment 12 days ago. Across the country, engineers have identified 1,850 rails with hairline cracks similar to those responsible for the latest tragedy.</p> <p>But with 20mph speed restrictions in operation on more than 160 stretches of line and little agreement on how quickly the operation can be completed, it is the hundreds of thousands of passengers, hit by widespread cancellations and severe delays, who are being forced to suffer.</p> <p>Like us unfortunate souls on the 15.38 last Thursday. For a mid-afternoon service, the train was busy; all the seats filled with business people, Scots heading to London for a long weekend, English families returning south at the end of the half-term break and tourists whose quick jaunt north had turned into an ordeal by rail. In the spaces between carriages, those unlucky enough to have been too late to get a seat made themselves as comfortable as they could as we finally pulled out of Glasgow.</p> <p>We at least had the small consolation that the train was moving at all. It was one of the first cross-border services to leave Glasgow after Railtrack's sudden decision to close the busy West Coast Main Line between the city and Gretna on Wednesday and equally sudden decision to reopen it on Thursday. Until the 15.38, passengers had been ferried on buses to Carlisle to pick up trains to take them further south.</p> <p>The West Coast Line is among the worst hit by years of disrepair. It is barely 100 miles from Glasgow to Carlisle, but on that stretch of track last week Railtrack engineers identified 179 hairline cracks. At least 32 of those sites require immediate repair or remedial work. Even taking all this into account, however, we remained warily confident that we would get to our destinations in a reasonable time. I had been assured by the man at the ticket window that 40 minutes late would be about as bad as it got. On top of the 40 minutes we had already waited for the driver, that would mean getting into Euston by 10.30pm, as against the scheduled time of 9.09pm. A respectable result given the poor start, especially as it meant being in London in time for last orders.</p> <p>For the first hour out of Glasgow, things seemed fine. Admittedly, the train may not have been going flat out, but it was still moving at a steady clip. Twice it had slowed right down, but both occasions had been mercifully brief. Then, at 5.34pm, we stopped. On the steep hillside to the right, a few sheep wandered down for a closer look before continuing their grazing. Through the trees down to the left, traffic flashed south on the M74.</p> <p>After a few minutes, just as the motorway buses began to take on a Space Age air of sleek efficiency, the train lurched forward into motion. Just. We set off so slowly that the sheep were still able to overtake us in search of fresh grass. As the sky blackened, the passengers on Coach C looked at each other in the grim realisation that the real trouble was just about to start.</p> <p>'I can't believe this is happening again,' said Lauren Nicholls, a 20-year-old student from Vancouver. 'I travelled up to Scotland from London on Tuesday and it took me 10 hours. I've been up here for two days and I've spent most of that on these trains. This whole trip has been a disaster.'</p> <p>We trundled on. By 6pm, we should have been long past Carlisle. As the lights of a town finally started to appear, some passengers gathered their belongings and made their way towards the doors. The train rolled along a platform and seemed to be about to stop. Then a sign passed the window: Lockerbie. Nearly two and a half hours after our scheduled departure, we had yet to reach the border.</p> <p>At 6.39pm, the train finally pulled into Carlisle. According to the conductor, we were now running 107 minutes late. On Coach C, the response was muted. A sort of Dunkirk spirit had kicked in as a group of passengers swapped stories of previous losing battles with the West Coast Line.</p> <p>David Gordon, from Motherwell, recounted the time he, his wife and two children had been on a train north when it had broken down at Oxenholme station in the Lake District and they had had to wait for two hours on a bus.</p> <p>Niall Thomas was not to be outdone. The IT consultant from Glasgow had been on his way to a stag night in Newcastle recently when, after many hours of delay and still far short of their destination, it was announced that the train was terminating where it stood. 'The guy came on and said that anybody travelling to Newcastle should try again the next day,' said Thomas. 'The worst thing was, the groom-to-be was with me, so he missed his own stag do.'</p> <p>'It is a fantastic way to travel when everything goes well,' sympathised Gordon. 'But when it goes wrong, it seems to go horribly wrong.' Prophetic words indeed.</p> <p>The train continued through the North-West at funeral pace. At times, the only way to be sure we were still moving was by watching the dark outlines of the trees that passed the windows in painful slow motion. By 7.35pm we reached Oxenholme, the third of 13 stops. Preston came into sight 40 minutes later, but with each mile that barely passed beneath our wheels London seemed further away. Gradually, the curiously British thrill at a shared ordeal was replaced by boredom, then frustration and finally anger.</p> <p>In the buffet car, Paul Donald and Tony O'Keefe had had enough. Their journey had began at 6.15 that morning, 217 miles north of Aberdeen on an oil rig in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. They should have been in the pub with their mates in Liverpool at the start of two weeks' leave. Instead they were still stuck on a train somewhere to the north. 'This is driving me fucking insane,' Donald growled. 'This lot are taking the piss. If they want to shut down the railway, they should do that, but if they are going to take \u00a375 off me for a ticket they should at least try and get me there. They're too greedy to say no to the money. That's their problem.'</p> <p>'It's those notice boards they put up in the stations with the efficiency figures,' said O'Keefe. 'It's always 98.8 something. Where the fuck do they get that garbage from?' The feeling of tempers rapidly fraying filled the air. Mine included. In the seat behind me, a small boy decided the best fun he could have was to lift up the tray table attached to the back of my seat and slam it down as hard as his little arms could. For a full half-hour he continued with his game, while his parents looked on, clearly relieved that it wasn't them he was bothering. I could take no more. 'Is there any chance you could get him to stop?' I asked his mother politely. 'He's only three, you know,' she snapped in reply and turned back to her magazine.</p> <p>Perhaps wisely, the train staff, other than the buffet manager, had been conspicuous by their absence. Apart from one early foray to check tickets, the conductor limited his presence to doleful Tannoy announcements at each station of the number of minutes we were now behind schedule. He was replaced at Crewe by a new man who walked down the train with the latest estimated times of arrival.</p> <p>At 9.09pm, the scheduled time for reaching Euston, we were still somewhere in the Midlands, north of Stafford. But the new conductor had some news: even at this pathetic rate, we would be in London between 11.25pm and 11.40pm. So when the buffet man announced at 10.30pm that he was closing for the night, we took that as a good sign. Wrong. At 11pm, the conductor came on the Tannoy to tell us that we would now reach Milton Keynes by 11.25pm, and London half an hour later. By a quarter to midnight, with Milton Keynes still to materialise, the conductor gave up making any predictions.</p> <p>Most of us had given up hope of ever reaching anywhere. As we lumbered through the darkness, it felt as if we had been abandoned to our fate as the rest of Britain tucked up for the night. Occasionally, we would slow down even more.

      "bodyText": "Glasgow, 3.30pm on Thursday. Preceded by a gentle, recorded harp strum, the cheerful conductor welcomed passengers aboard Virgin Train's 15.38 Glasgow Central to London Euston service with good news. Against all the odds, the train was prepared and would depart from Platform 1 on time. We passengers, who had arrived braced for unhappy tidings, settled back in our seats, picked up our newspapers and smugly congratulated ourselves on our uncanny ability to sidestep the near-paralysis to which Britain's crumbling rail network had been reduced last week. At 3.39pm, another tinny harp strum. This time, the conductor said, there had been a slight hiccough: there was no driver. Through every carriage swept the resigned groan of travellers. 'We'll be on our way as soon as we find him,' the Tannoy voice added half-heartedly. It was 40 minutes before the driver appeared for duty. Before it had left the platform in Glasgow, the service was almost an hour behind the timetable. This was an inauspicious start. There was worse to come. This weekend the rail network is undergoing its biggest repair programme for more than a century. More than 20,000 Railtrack staff are working to repair 41,000 metres of rail identified as unsafe in the wake of the Hatfield derailment 12 days ago. Across the country, engineers have identified 1,850 rails with hairline cracks similar to those responsible for the latest tragedy. But with 20mph speed restrictions in operation on more than 160 stretches of line and little agreement on how quickly the operation can be completed, it is the hundreds of thousands of passengers, hit by widespread cancellations and severe delays, who are being forced to suffer. Like us unfortunate souls on the 15.38 last Thursday. For a mid-afternoon service, the train was busy; all the seats filled with business people, Scots heading to London for a long weekend, English families returning south at the end of the half-term break and tourists whose quick jaunt north had turned into an ordeal by rail. In the spaces between carriages, those unlucky enough to have been too late to get a seat made themselves as comfortable as they could as we finally pulled out of Glasgow. We at least had the small consolation that the train was moving at all. It was one of the first cross-border services to leave Glasgow after Railtrack's sudden decision to close the busy West Coast Main Line between the city and Gretna on Wednesday and equally sudden decision to reopen it on Thursday. Until the 15.38, passengers had been ferried on buses to Carlisle to pick up trains to take them further south. The West Coast Line is among the worst hit by years of disrepair. It is barely 100 miles from Glasgow to Carlisle, but on that stretch of track last week Railtrack engineers identified 179 hairline cracks. At least 32 of those sites require immediate repair or remedial work. Even taking all this into account, however, we remained warily confident that we would get to our destinations in a reasonable time. I had been assured by the man at the ticket window that 40 minutes late would be about as bad as it got. On top of the 40 minutes we had already waited for the driver, that would mean getting into Euston by 10.30pm, as against the scheduled time of 9.09pm. A respectable result given the poor start, especially as it meant being in London in time for last orders. For the first hour out of Glasgow, things seemed fine. Admittedly, the train may not have been going flat out, but it was still moving at a steady clip. Twice it had slowed right down, but both occasions had been mercifully brief. Then, at 5.34pm, we stopped. On the steep hillside to the right, a few sheep wandered down for a closer look before continuing their grazing. Through the trees down to the left, traffic flashed south on the M74. After a few minutes, just as the motorway buses began to take on a Space Age air of sleek efficiency, the train lurched forward into motion. Just. We set off so slowly that the sheep were still able to overtake us in search of fresh grass. As the sky blackened, the passengers on Coach C looked at each other in the grim realisation that the real trouble was just about to start. 'I can't believe this is happening again,' said Lauren Nicholls, a 20-year-old student from Vancouver. 'I travelled up to Scotland from London on Tuesday and it took me 10 hours. I've been up here for two days and I've spent most of that on these trains. This whole trip has been a disaster.' We trundled on. By 6pm, we should have been long past Carlisle. As the lights of a town finally started to appear, some passengers gathered their belongings and made their way towards the doors. The train rolled along a platform and seemed to be about to stop. Then a sign passed the window: Lockerbie. Nearly two and a half hours after our scheduled departure, we had yet to reach the border. At 6.39pm, the train finally pulled into Carlisle. According to the conductor, we were now running 107 minutes late. On Coach C, the response was muted. A sort of Dunkirk spirit had kicked in as a group of passengers swapped stories of previous losing battles with the West Coast Line. David Gordon, from Motherwell, recounted the time he, his wife and two children had been on a train north when it had broken down at Oxenholme station in the Lake District and they had had to wait for two hours on a bus. Niall Thomas was not to be outdone. The IT consultant from Glasgow had been on his way to a stag night in Newcastle recently when, after many hours of delay and still far short of their destination, it was announced that the train was terminating where it stood. 'The guy came on and said that anybody travelling to Newcastle should try again the next day,' said Thomas. 'The worst thing was, the groom-to-be was with me, so he missed his own stag do.' 'It is a fantastic way to travel when everything goes well,' sympathised Gordon. 'But when it goes wrong, it seems to go horribly wrong.' Prophetic words indeed. The train continued through the North-West at funeral pace. At times, the only way to be sure we were still moving was by watching the dark outlines of the trees that passed the windows in painful slow motion. By 7.35pm we reached Oxenholme, the third of 13 stops. Preston came into sight 40 minutes later, but with each mile that barely passed beneath our wheels London seemed further away. Gradually, the curiously British thrill at a shared ordeal was replaced by boredom, then frustration and finally anger. In the buffet car, Paul Donald and Tony O'Keefe had had enough. Their journey had began at 6.15 that morning, 217 miles north of Aberdeen on an oil rig in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. They should have been in the pub with their mates in Liverpool at the start of two weeks' leave. Instead they were still stuck on a train somewhere to the north. 'This is driving me fucking insane,' Donald growled. 'This lot are taking the piss. If they want to shut down the railway, they should do that, but if they are going to take \u00a375 off me for a ticket they should at least try and get me there. They're too greedy to say no to the money. That's their problem.' 'It's those notice boards they put up in the stations with the efficiency figures,' said O'Keefe. 'It's always 98.8 something. Where the fuck do they get that garbage from?' The feeling of tempers rapidly fraying filled the air. Mine included. In the seat behind me, a small boy decided the best fun he could have was to lift up the tray table attached to the back of my seat and slam it down as hard as his little arms could. For a full half-hour he continued with his game, while his parents looked on, clearly relieved that it wasn't them he was bothering. I could take no more. 'Is there any chance you could get him to stop?' I asked his mother politely. 'He's only three, you know,' she snapped in reply and turned back to her magazine. Perhaps wisely, the train staff, other than the buffet manager, had been conspicuous by their absence. Apart from one early foray to check tickets, the conductor limited his presence to doleful Tannoy announcements at each station of the number of minutes we were now behind schedule. He was replaced at Crewe by a new man who walked down the train with the latest estimated times of arrival. At 9.09pm, the scheduled time for reaching Euston, we were still somewhere in the Midlands, north of Stafford. But the new conductor had some news: even at this pathetic rate, we would be in London between 11.25pm and 11.40pm. So when the buffet man announced at 10.30pm that he was closing for the night, we took that as a good sign. Wrong. At 11pm, the conductor came on the Tannoy to tell us that we would now reach Milton Keynes by 11.25pm, and London half an hour later. By a quarter to midnight, with Milton Keynes still to materialise, the conductor gave up making any predictions. Most of us had given up hope of ever reaching anywhere. As we lumbered through the darkness, it felt as if we had been abandoned to our fate as the rest of Britain tucked up for the night. Occasionally, we would slow down even more. But finally we reached Milton Keynes, then Watford. London could not be far off. Once again we had underestimated the seriousness of our predicament and it was not until 12.59am - nearly three hours 50 minutes late - that we pulled into Euston. Passengers piled out to be greeted by loved ones with the enthusiasm of those who had started to lose all hope. From Glasgow to London, a distance of 400 miles, had taken more than nine hours, almost the same amount of time as it takes to fly from London to South Africa, across some 53 countries and the length of the African continent. After all this, we deserved some good news and it finally came at Euston. There was another train at least an hour behind us.

      "body": "<p>Every fourth Friday night is Asian night at the Quebec nightclub, a dazzling silver and steel bar-cum-night club with a predominantly gay clientele in the heart of Leicester's city centre. Against a backdrop of the latest remixes of Kylie, Spiller and Steps, the handful of Asian men and women willing to be 'out' in public dance flamboyantly under the mirrored balls and flashing strobe lights.</p> <p>It is a small but vibrant scene, which has been the focus of intense media attention since it emerged that Harish Purohit, a prominent local Hindu priest who was found murdered last week, had been living a double life.</p> <p>By day, the married 42-year-old would juggle his roles as secretary of the National Association of Hindu Priests, president of the Hindu Federation and manager of social services at Leicester City Council with his ceremonial duties at the Shree Shakti Mandir temple, which he ran with his father. By night, he would don designer jeans, smart shirts, shoes, never trainers, and dance until the small hours at the city's gay clubs.</p> <p>He was last seen alive at 11pm on Thursday, 19 October, when he left home for an unspecified destination. His body was found the following morning in the living room of a house in Harrison Road, close to his temple, that he had bought to renovate as a new family home.</p> <p>He had been stabbed 13 times with a five-inch knife and died of a punctured lung. After the attack, his killer or killers blocked the front door with a sofa, turned the gas on and lit a fire, hoping to turn the building into an inferno and destroy any forensic evidence. Harish's car was found nearly two miles away: the keys are still missing. The gruesome discovery was made when neighbours reported smoke seeping out from under the front door.</p> <p>Initial speculation focused on the possibility of a robbery gone wrong or a racially motivated, homophobic attack - a Mardi Gras-style festival planned for Leicester earlier this year was cancelled after vicious threats from right-wing activists. But what is quickly becoming clear is that the men responsible for the death of Harish Purohit were almost certainly Asian and that his murder was a brutal act of revenge.</p> <p>Harish Purohit loved his religion and his community. But what he loved most of all was sex, mostly with young men, and the riskier the encounter the better. Living at the darkest, seediest end of the gay scene, Purohit spent much of his time at Abbey Park and 'Central Motors', the local names given to the public toilets in the city's two main cruising areas. He would loiter in the toilets awaiting sexual encounters that ranged from flashing to full intercourse.</p> <p>But that was not enough. Police have learnt that Harish would regularly use his position within the Asian community to take young Asians who had concerns about their sexuality under his wing. He would offer them support and encouragement to 'come out' and then demand sexual favours in return.</p> <p>For those who refused, Harish would threaten to tell their parents and friends that they were gay. Rather than risk being ostracised from the tight-knit community, many complied. In many cases, being with Harish would have been their first gay sexual experience. On at least one occasion he is accused of committing rape.</p> <p>As his power and influence grew, so his ploys became more sophisticated. He became a volunteer for a gay switchboard and continued to use his blackmail tactics on the vulnerable Asians who would call him up. He would offer to meet them, discuss their sexuality and then blackmail them into sex. As his reputation began to spread, so he became a figure to be avoided at all costs.</p> <p>'I knew Harish well, he was a good friend of mine and when he died a friend called and told me to watch myself,' says one gay Asian man, who asked not to be named. 'I told him I had nothing to worry about because I didn't have enemies. Harish had lots. He treated a lot of people on the gay scene very badly. A lot of people would no longer talk to him, they hated him. He said people were simply jealous because he was having sex with lots of nice young men and they were not.'</p> <p>A few years ago, Harish went into partnership with a friend to establish a series of care homes for people with learning difficulties. It proved to be a successful business venture and as the money started rolling in, so he began to live more flamboyantly. He bought himself a silver BMW 320i, which became his pride and joy, and bought a house in Harrison Road to renovate for himself and his wife. The sparsely furnished house also served as the ideal venue for more lengthy sexual encounters and parties.</p> <p>'He was a lovely bloke with a fantastic smile and real charisma,' says one friend who asked to remain anonymous. He loved to camp it up on his nights out and he loved dancing while on poppers. We had a lot of good times but I stopped hanging around with him because I was being tarred with the same brush. He was revered within the general Hindu community because of his work as a priest but he was hated within the gay community because of what he had done.'</p> <p>But the bad feelings were not just confined to the gay community. More than a decade ago, Harish emerged from the city's now-defunct gay night club Spots to find a group of Hindu men waiting for him. Harish had been the priest at the wedding of one of the men who felt his ceremony had somehow been tainted. They beat him so severely he was left with two black eyes and a cracked rib.</p> <p>'He brushed it off at the time as one of those things,' says his friend. 'It's an occupational hazard for lots of gay men. He was incredibly charismatic, a good talker. He could also be very manipulative. You would think that he would be able to talk his way out of any situation. It makes you wonder what went wrong this time.'</p> <p>Harish arrived in Britain from Kenya at the age of seven with his three brothers and four sisters. His father, also a priest, founded a temple and brought Harish up in the same tradition.

      "bodyText": "Every fourth Friday night is Asian night at the Quebec nightclub, a dazzling silver and steel bar-cum-night club with a predominantly gay clientele in the heart of Leicester's city centre. Against a backdrop of the latest remixes of Kylie, Spiller and Steps, the handful of Asian men and women willing to be 'out' in public dance flamboyantly under the mirrored balls and flashing strobe lights. It is a small but vibrant scene, which has been the focus of intense media attention since it emerged that Harish Purohit, a prominent local Hindu priest who was found murdered last week, had been living a double life. By day, the married 42-year-old would juggle his roles as secretary of the National Association of Hindu Priests, president of the Hindu Federation and manager of social services at Leicester City Council with his ceremonial duties at the Shree Shakti Mandir temple, which he ran with his father. By night, he would don designer jeans, smart shirts, shoes, never trainers, and dance until the small hours at the city's gay clubs. He was last seen alive at 11pm on Thursday, 19 October, when he left home for an unspecified destination. His body was found the following morning in the living room of a house in Harrison Road, close to his temple, that he had bought to renovate as a new family home. He had been stabbed 13 times with a five-inch knife and died of a punctured lung. After the attack, his killer or killers blocked the front door with a sofa, turned the gas on and lit a fire, hoping to turn the building into an inferno and destroy any forensic evidence. Harish's car was found nearly two miles away: the keys are still missing. The gruesome discovery was made when neighbours reported smoke seeping out from under the front door. Initial speculation focused on the possibility of a robbery gone wrong or a racially motivated, homophobic attack - a Mardi Gras-style festival planned for Leicester earlier this year was cancelled after vicious threats from right-wing activists. But what is quickly becoming clear is that the men responsible for the death of Harish Purohit were almost certainly Asian and that his murder was a brutal act of revenge. Harish Purohit loved his religion and his community. But what he loved most of all was sex, mostly with young men, and the riskier the encounter the better. Living at the darkest, seediest end of the gay scene, Purohit spent much of his time at Abbey Park and 'Central Motors', the local names given to the public toilets in the city's two main cruising areas. He would loiter in the toilets awaiting sexual encounters that ranged from flashing to full intercourse. But that was not enough. Police have learnt that Harish would regularly use his position within the Asian community to take young Asians who had concerns about their sexuality under his wing. He would offer them support and encouragement to 'come out' and then demand sexual favours in return. For those who refused, Harish would threaten to tell their parents and friends that they were gay. Rather than risk being ostracised from the tight-knit community, many complied. In many cases, being with Harish would have been their first gay sexual experience. On at least one occasion he is accused of committing rape. As his power and influence grew, so his ploys became more sophisticated. He became a volunteer for a gay switchboard and continued to use his blackmail tactics on the vulnerable Asians who would call him up. He would offer to meet them, discuss their sexuality and then blackmail them into sex. As his reputation began to spread, so he became a figure to be avoided at all costs. 'I knew Harish well, he was a good friend of mine and when he died a friend called and told me to watch myself,' says one gay Asian man, who asked not to be named. 'I told him I had nothing to worry about because I didn't have enemies. Harish had lots. He treated a lot of people on the gay scene very badly. A lot of people would no longer talk to him, they hated him. He said people were simply jealous because he was having sex with lots of nice young men and they were not.' A few years ago, Harish went into partnership with a friend to establish a series of care homes for people with learning difficulties. It proved to be a successful business venture and as the money started rolling in, so he began to live more flamboyantly. He bought himself a silver BMW 320i, which became his pride and joy, and bought a house in Harrison Road to renovate for himself and his wife. The sparsely furnished house also served as the ideal venue for more lengthy sexual encounters and parties. 'He was a lovely bloke with a fantastic smile and real charisma,' says one friend who asked to remain anonymous. He loved to camp it up on his nights out and he loved dancing while on poppers. We had a lot of good times but I stopped hanging around with him because I was being tarred with the same brush. He was revered within the general Hindu community because of his work as a priest but he was hated within the gay community because of what he had done.' But the bad feelings were not just confined to the gay community. More than a decade ago, Harish emerged from the city's now-defunct gay night club Spots to find a group of Hindu men waiting for him. Harish had been the priest at the wedding of one of the men who felt his ceremony had somehow been tainted. They beat him so severely he was left with two black eyes and a cracked rib. 'He brushed it off at the time as one of those things,' says his friend. 'It's an occupational hazard for lots of gay men. He was incredibly charismatic, a good talker. He could also be very manipulative. You would think that he would be able to talk his way out of any situation. It makes you wonder what went wrong this time.' Harish arrived in Britain from Kenya at the age of seven with his three brothers and four sisters. His father, also a priest, founded a temple and brought Harish up in the same tradition. His son proved talented and dedicated to his work, but strived hard to bring a more modern flavour to his religious duties. He was praised for attempting to bridge the gap between young and old Hindus, for conducting his services in English and taking the time to explain the significance of ceremonies to non Hindus. Harish worked hard to keep the truth about his sexuality secret from many of those closest to him but a surprising number were in the know. 'We all knew, it was obvious,' said one local. 'But it was something that nobody ever spoke about. As long as he didn't bring it with him to the temple, no one minded.' At a press conference soon after his death, his wife of four years, Anjana Joshi, revealed that Harish had told her of his sexuality long before they were wed. 'We were happily married,' she said. 'When you love someone that love is unconditional.' The news attracted strong criticism from members of the Hindu religious community. Jagdish Bhatt, secretary of the Federation of Hindu Priests, said Hinduism viewed homosexuality as against nature, and a spokesman for the nearby Shree Sanatan temple, Nathubhai Jagjivan, said the revelation was 'shocking'. Harish's elder brother, Janardan Purohit, said Harish would have been hurt by some of the comments: 'Our teachings tell us not to reject people - regardless of their faith, lifestyle or anything else. My advice to people who are saying things like this is to go back and take another look at the religion. 'I cannot think of any reason why anyone would want to hurt him. Everyone we have spoken to has nothing but good things to say about my brother. There is nothing to suggest why he was murdered, especially like this.'

A few seconds later, two more Asian men followed. The five got into a light-coloured saloon car and drove off. Police are trying to track the men who have now become chief suspects in the murder. The Purohit case is one of the highest-profile murders ever undertaken by the city's police force. More than 100 officers are working on the case. The officer in charge, Detective Superintendent Brian Warraker, has confirmed that his team is probing the blackmail allegations but prefers to keep his best leads close to his chest.

The Home Secretary wants the stalwarts of the Neighbourhood Watch to report local thugs and problem families and actively 'get involved' in seeking so-called anti-social behaviour orders against them. But probation officers warned that attempts to turn the sentinels of suburbia into amateur detectives risked making them targets for violence by accused youths. Until now decisions on issuing orders - meant to cover behaviour causing 'alarm, distress or harassment' to others - have been left to police, probation officers and local authorities, who proved initially resistant to using them, much to Ministers' irritation. Although Straw said that more than 100 orders have now been issued after encouragement from the Home Office, the new initiative will be seen as another attempt to override professionals' reluctance by tapping into deep public anxieties about gangs of loitering teenagers indulging in vandalism or harassment. In a speech to the National Neighbourhood Watch Conference yesterday, Straw said anti-social behaviour 'blights people's lives', adding: 'I want you and your members to get involved in the process itself by notifyng the police and local authorities of cases of anti-social behaviour and asking to be involved in the decision-making process that leads to the application for an order. If you or your neighbours are suffering from anti-social behaviour, do something about it now.' There will be forms for ordinary people to fill in complaining about issues from teenage vandals and 'neighbours from hell' to prostitution or car crime, Straw said, which they can then present to police or local authorities, pushing for an application for a court order to be made. But Harry Fletcher, the spokesman for the National Association of Probation Officers, warned the idea risked retribution against Neighbourhood Watch members. 'The Home Secretary is in danger of encouraging a \"snitch and reprisal\" culture, which would be extremely unhelpful to community relations,' he said. 'He needs to realise that Anti-Social Behaviour Orders are not popular with the courts and they are not popular with the professionals.' Labour has repeatedly suffered this year from the backfiring of 'tough' measures that turned out to be ill thought through. Straw has previously urged members of the public to tackle thugs directly themselves, pointing out that he himself once rugby-tackled a mugger - prompting police warnings that civilians should not put themselves at risk. The orders, designed to combat low-level criminality with sanctions of up to five years in jail if breached, were introduced last April but got off to a slow start, prompting Straw to criticise councils and courts for not using their new powers. Shadow Home Secretary Ann Widdecombe accused him of pushing the responsibility for the poor response to ASBOs on to other people. 'I would never discourage anybody coming forward with information, but this is not what Neighbourhood Watch groups were set up to do.'",

It ended on a November evening in 1993, as Robert Thompson and Jon Venables left Preston Crown Court with the sentence of the mob upon them. 'Kill them. Hang them,' screamed the crowd, wishing the blue police vans bearing two 11-year-olds were bound for Tyburn rather than for cosy, council secure units specialising in the makeover of monsters.</p> <p>By contrast, the final act in sentencing the Bulger killers was a low-key affair. The court of the Lord Chief Justice was half empty for Thursday's ruling, delivered by Lord Woolf in the mild and slightly halting manner of a newly-recruited Chatsworth tour guide. Several reporters bolted to file their stories at the mention of an unexpectedly low eight-year sentence, so missing Woolf's quiet punchline.

Instead, the gruesome details of the premeditated abduction, the paint poured into James's eyes, the crash of an iron railway plate on an infant skull and the body placed on a track to be cut in two by a goods train were rehearsed again, in a chronicle as horrible and familiar as if it had happened yesterday. But years have passed and Thompson and Venables, educated and remorseful, have made what Woolf called 'striking progress'.</p> <p>His decision to open their way to freedom was right and forward-looking. Michael Howard's denunciation of 'unparalleled evil', on hearing that his unlawful, ill-judged 15-year tariff had been so flouted, offered only a timewarped echo of the trial judge's summary of long ago. Even so, Howard may have struck a chord beyond the auxiliary prosecutors of the lynch mob.</p> <p>We are, deep down, happier with the concept of evil than redemption. Wickedness, whether bred-in-the-bone or a contagion affecting the troubled and deprived, is a convenient, catch-all notion that masks any need to excavate the inexplicable. The sinister bond that drives 10-year-old boys to murder is not amenable to rational deconstruction. And so we lump them in with a gallery of the tainted, from Pol Pot to Mary Bell, grateful that we, and our children, are immune to such poison.</p> <p>Redemption is harder to take. When Bell, the killer of two small boys, was tracked down in the wake of Gitta Sereny's biography, few applauded the fact that she, the mother of a teenage daughter, had flourished. Instead, newspaper accounts of her life bore undertones of freakishness. Any suggestion that Bell had a predilection for cat-strangling would have provoked less of a frisson of disgust than her supposed 'gentleness' and wish to work with children.</p> <p>Yet she is the matrix for rehabilitation. A damaged child, Bell was sexually abused by staff and inmates of her special unit before finally emerging to as normal a life as is feasible for anyone pursued by journalists, biographers and all the ghosts of the past. How much better the chances of Thompson and Venables must be. Still there was a rancorous subtext to last week's reports of young men supposedly grown plump on food parcels supplied by caring parents and lavished with the best the state can offer.</p> <p>Heavens, they even have access to television and a pool table before the key turns in the lock at night. What sort of punishment is that? No sort at all, according to Denise Fergus, whose tragedy gives her the unassailable, understandable right to rail against clemency (and, on a minor point, against the newspapers who caricatured her as the weeping victim of last week's ruling. In fact, she endured the ordeal with absolute dignity and composure).</p> <p>But logic, justice and economics decree that Lord Woolf is also right to spare Thompson and Venables 'corrosive' and drug-ridden young offender institutions that would unravel all progress. I would guess that his dig at youth jails was calculated to reverberate far beyond the Bulger case. When I recently discussed prisons with him, he, a notable reformer, described over-crowding as 'the cancer at the heart of the system'.</p> <p>This year, the number of under-17s in jail rose 11 per cent to 2,929. Two months ago, Kevin Henson, aged 17, hanged himself from a pipe in Feltham Young Offenders Institution and became the latest in a litany of similar victims: Zahid Mabarek, battered to death as his parents organised the party for his imminent release; Lee Waite, who committed suicide after a brutal assault by other inmates; Jeffrey Horler, aged 15, who took his life in a Feltham cell 200 miles from his Norfolk home.</p> <p>A dozen teenagers have killed themselves this year in British prisons, crammed with society's Untermenschen: the knife-carriers, the pilferers of car radios and, once Jack Straw's new legislation kicks in, those twice in contravention of community service orders. Only the intervention of Lord Woolf and others prevented the last category being mandatorily siphoned into institutions geared to recycling rather than redeeming young offenders.</p> <p>Who speaks for those children? Most vocally, Sir David Ramsbotham, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, who has twice castigated 'the disgraceful treatment and appalling conditions' at Feltham and lambasted woeful rehabilitation elsewhere. In one prison, he found young men idly crayoning in children's colouring books because there was nothing else to do. Exactly a year has passed since Ramsbotham blotted his own copybook.</p> <p>What he told me during an interview exactly presaged Lord Woolf's conclusion that the Bulger killers should be freed as soon as possible. 'I should not wish them to go to some of the institutions I have seen,' Ramsbotham said. For this, he was forced publicly to apologise by the Home Secretary. It was decided shortly afterwards that his inspectorate would be swallowed up in a new body covering prisons and probation. The suspicion is that Ramsbotham's outspokenness and harrumphing exposures of hideous jail conditions had become too irksome for his political masters to bear.</p> <p>His likely departure is to be deplored, especially in a climate in which many wish the Bulger killers had got their fix of suffering from a penal system admirably equipped to supply it. Such atavistic attitudes imply, under the kindest interpretation, an Augustinian line on salvation. Redeem them, Lord, but not quite yet. Hence the value of Lord Woolf, whose creed of redemption is already well-aired. Two weeks ago, he hinted to me that Myra Hindley might also hope for freedom. Such an outcome would provoke an uproar beside which last week's reprise of resurrected evils would look mild.</p> <p>But the scandal hinges not on those we let out of jail but on those whom we keep in. Of course, we should remember, as they always will, how brutally Thompson and Venables extinguished an innocent life. Other images, less reminiscent of immutable evil, also linger. 'Can I go home now?' one of the boys asked childishly during the trial. The answer, eight years down the line, is yes. Applaud its humanity and reserve the fury for the fate of those in Feltham and elsewhere who will never have their homecoming.</p>",

And so we lump them in with a gallery of the tainted, from Pol Pot to Mary Bell, grateful that we, and our children, are immune to such poison. Redemption is harder to take. When Bell, the killer of two small boys, was tracked down in the wake of Gitta Sereny's biography, few applauded the fact that she, the mother of a teenage daughter, had flourished. Instead, newspaper accounts of her life bore undertones of freakishness. Any suggestion that Bell had a predilection for cat-strangling would have provoked less of a frisson of disgust than her supposed 'gentleness' and wish to work with children. Yet she is the matrix for rehabilitation. A damaged child, Bell was sexually abused by staff and inmates of her special unit before finally emerging to as normal a life as is feasible for anyone pursued by journalists, biographers and all the ghosts of the past. How much better the chances of Thompson and Venables must be. Still there was a rancorous subtext to last week's reports of young men supposedly grown plump on food parcels supplied by caring parents and lavished with the best the state can offer. Heavens, they even have access to television and a pool table before the key turns in the lock at night. What sort of punishment is that? No sort at all, according to Denise Fergus, whose tragedy gives her the unassailable, understandable right to rail against clemency (and, on a minor point, against the newspapers who caricatured her as the weeping victim of last week's ruling. In fact, she endured the ordeal with absolute dignity and composure). But logic, justice and economics decree that Lord Woolf is also right to spare Thompson and Venables 'corrosive' and drug-ridden young offender institutions that would unravel all progress. I would guess that his dig at youth jails was calculated to reverberate far beyond the Bulger case. When I recently discussed prisons with him, he, a notable reformer, described over-crowding as 'the cancer at the heart of the system'. This year, the number of under-17s in jail rose 11 per cent to 2,929. Two months ago, Kevin Henson, aged 17, hanged himself from a pipe in Feltham Young Offenders Institution and became the latest in a litany of similar victims: Zahid Mabarek, battered to death as his parents organised the party for his imminent release; Lee Waite, who committed suicide after a brutal assault by other inmates; Jeffrey Horler, aged 15, who took his life in a Feltham cell 200 miles from his Norfolk home. A dozen teenagers have killed themselves this year in British prisons, crammed with society's Untermenschen: the knife-carriers, the pilferers of car radios and, once Jack Straw's new legislation kicks in, those twice in contravention of community service orders. Only the intervention of Lord Woolf and others prevented the last category being mandatorily siphoned into institutions geared to recycling rather than redeeming young offenders. Who speaks for those children? Most vocally, Sir David Ramsbotham, the Chief Inspector of Prisons, who has twice castigated 'the disgraceful treatment and appalling conditions' at Feltham and lambasted woeful rehabilitation elsewhere. In one prison, he found young men idly crayoning in children's colouring books because there was nothing else to do. Exactly a year has passed since Ramsbotham blotted his own copybook. What he told me during an interview exactly presaged Lord Woolf's conclusion that the Bulger killers should be freed as soon as possible. 'I should not wish them to go to some of the institutions I have seen,' Ramsbotham said. For this, he was forced publicly to apologise by the Home Secretary. It was decided shortly afterwards that his inspectorate would be swallowed up in a new body covering prisons and probation. The suspicion is that Ramsbotham's outspokenness and harrumphing exposures of hideous jail conditions had become too irksome for his political masters to bear. His likely departure is to be deplored, especially in a climate in which many wish the Bulger killers had got their fix of suffering from a penal system admirably equipped to supply it. Such atavistic attitudes imply, under the kindest interpretation, an Augustinian line on salvation. Redeem them, Lord, but not quite yet. Hence the value of Lord Woolf, whose creed of redemption is already well-aired. Two weeks ago, he hinted to me that Myra Hindley might also hope for freedom. Such an outcome would provoke an uproar beside which last week's reprise of resurrected evils would look mild. But the scandal hinges not on those we let out of jail but on those whom we keep in. Of course, we should remember, as they always will, how brutally Thompson and Venables extinguished an innocent life. Other images, less reminiscent of immutable evil, also linger. 'Can I go home now?' one of the boys asked childishly during the trial. The answer, eight years down the line, is yes. Applaud its humanity and reserve the fury for the fate of those in Feltham and elsewhere who will never have their homecoming.",

      "bodyText": "The human form of mad cow disease claimed its youngest victim yesterday as it emerged that potentially lethal BSE-infected waste is leaking into the environment from the carcasses of infected cattle. Zoe Jeffries, a sports-mad 14-year-old who loved cheeseburgers, became victim number 82 of the epidemic that broke out after the Government repeatedly misled the public about the dangers of eating beef until a ban was announced in 1996. Zoe's death was announced yesterday by a Greater Manchester police spokesman, who said: 'Ms Jeffries had been diagnosed some time ago as suffering from vCJD, the human form of BSE. She died this morning at her home. Her family would like to work through this difficult period with as much privacy and dignity as possible.' Harrowing footage of Zoe, lying sedated and uncomprehending as her mother and three younger sisters took turns to stroke her hair, was released ahead of the Government's BSE report published last week, which revealed an astonishing level of cover-ups to prevent the public knowing the truth about the scale of the disease. The pictures showed Zoe lying in a metal-sided bed in her Wigan home, with posters of Leonardo DiCaprio around her. Stroking her hair, Helen, Zoe's mother, said: 'It's just as if someone had stuck a knife into Zoe's body. I really do think she has been murdered.' Her mother also expressed guilt because she frequently fed her children beefburgers. 'I can't remember the makes I bought but they were the cheapest ones. Zoe ate them probably three times a week from the age of two-and-a-half until she was five. It's what she liked to eat. I bought mince and shepherd's pies.' As Zoe's death was announced, the scale of a possible CJD epidemic was being reassessed. A 74-year-old man who died last year was yesterday confirmed to have had the disease. The death has triggered questions over whether a larger section of society than initially thought could be vulnerable to the disease. Medical professionals are being urged to be 'more vigilant' about causes of death among the elderly, a Department of Health spokesman said. The news of the latest fatalities came as an Observer investigation discovered that BSE-infected ash is escaping from incinerators burning slaughtered cattle as well as dumps storing mountains of cow carcasses. Sources have revealed Environment Agency fears that a Lincolnshire incinerator burning 250 tonnes of cattle a day since April is not destroying the infective BSE protein which transmits the disease to humans. Tests carried out by Environment Agency officials on ash from one incinerator have found potentially lethal proteins in the residue. The agency has demanded that Fibrogen, the company which owns the incinerator, 'identifies measures to improve the combustion of the material' and 'design and install' new equipment. The ash containing the BSE proteins is being put on trucks, driven to Scunthorpe and dumped in a landfill site in the North Lincolnshire village of Winterton. It has also emerged that the Environment Agency is investigating the storage of thousands of tonnes of cattle carcasses in an old bowling alley in Blyton, Lincolnshire. Photographic and video evidence taken by local residents show trucks leaving the dump covered with cow remains. One photo shows maggots on the truck. The agency has confirmed its legal team is considering action against the owners. Mandy Thompson, who lives in Blyton, said: 'This material carries the risk of a hideous and incurable disease. It is diabolical what is happening. We have always been told that it is safe and that none of this material can escape, but we've seen trucks coming out of the depot covered in the stuff.' These problems highlight the continued public health hazard caused by BSE and the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of older cattle a year under a government scheme designed to halt the spread of mad cow disease. After the BSE scandal erupted in 1996, the Government demanded that all cattle over 30 months should be destroyed even if they showed no signs of BSE. The fear was that older cattle were most likely to be incubating the disease and the Ministry of Agriculture estimates that 1 per cent might be contaminated. The original plan was for the carcasses to be boiled, mashed up and then burnt in a furnace at a temperature of more than 1,000 Celsius to kill the BSE protein. But until this April there was only one incinerator, in Southampton, capable of burning the cattle remains at such a temperature. As a result 'mad cow mountains' have been building up in secret warehouses around the country which now hold more than 400,000 tonnes of BSE waste.

      "body": "<p>Billy McIntyre tried to stick to his routine on Wednesday night. At about 7pm he left his terraced house on a quiet estate in the north of Aberdeen and made the 10-minute journey up the hill to the city's royal infirmary.</p> <p>For an hour and a half he sat with his daughter Donna, aged 21, who has been in hospital since being diagnosed with new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in September. As usual, he chatted with her, tickled her, and tousled her hair to keep her animated.</p> <p>When he returned home he could not stomach the thought of dinner. He made do with a cup of tea, and tried to concentrate on the television. At 8am the next day, McIntyre rose, washed and dressed before going into the kitchen for some breakfast. He turned on the radio and waited. It was a long, slow morning. At 12.32pm, Nick Brown, the agriculture secretary, rose to announce publication of the public inquiry into Britain's BSE epidemic.</p> <p>'I was emotional all the way through the announcement,' McIntyre said. 'I was crying a lot. Some of that was relief that the answers were coming out. But mainly it was anger because the report was so damning. I'm not going to congratulate ministers on this report because the whole thing should never have been allowed to happen. I don't even accept their apology.' McIntyre's daughter will be dead in months.</p> <p>David Bee had never seen anything like it. The cow was arching its back, waving its head from side to side. It was pitifully thin. His colleague, Mike Teale, had told him of being chased by a similarly afflicted beast which had 'chased him across the box on her knees'.</p> <p>It was three days before Christmas, 1984. Bee, a well-known local vet, had been called to Pitsham Farm on the South Downs by its owner, Peter Stent. Stent was worried. One of his cows was ill. He had no idea what it was.</p> <p>When Bee arrived, he was not sure what to think. Maybe there was a local problem with mercury poisoning Stent's herd. Maybe it was a kidney disease. Nobody knew then, but Stent's sick animal would soon become famous as 'Cow 133'. In the heart of farming country, Bee was staring into the eyes of a disaster.</p> <p>He never expected a walk-on part in the story of Britain's biggest public health scandal. Most of the locals knew him as an enthusiastic 'joiner-in' at church in his picturesque village of West Liss. His bright tone made him a favourite when it came to reading out passages from the Bible.</p> <p>Cow 133 was the first case of BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Sixteen years and sixteen volumes of public inquiry later, the Government stands accused of failing the public. Bureaucracy, caution and secrecy has led, slowly and painfully, to the realisation that the structures in place to protect the people had simply not worked.</p> <p>Last week, Lord Phillips' report into how a disease in cows became a tragedy for humans shone a light into the deepest recesses of government operation. Debate so far has focused on the surface story, the missed opportunities and confused messages which allowed an ugly sore to fester.</p> <p>That story was contained in Volume 1 of Lord Phillips' inquiry. But there are 15 other volumes, thousands of pages of memos and secret deals, legal challenges and stand-up rows that reveal how government really works - and not always work in the public's interest. Not since the Scott inquiry into the Arms to Iraq affair has Britain seen such a damning indictment of its public 'servants'.</p> <p>Carol Richardson had just returned from holiday in September 1995. A pathologist at the government's Central Veterinary Laboratory, she was asked to study the brain of an adult cow from Pitsham Farm, one that Bee had seen. After looking at slides of the brain she confirmed that it showed characteristics of a 'spongiform encephalopathy', BSE. It was the start.</p> <p>Richardson sought a second opinion from a colleague, Dr Martin Jeffrey. She left the slides on his work bench in the laboratory and went to lunch. On her return, Jeffrey had left a note by one of the slides. 'Bovine scrapie' he wrote, referring to the BSE-type disease common in sheep.</p> <p>Richardson's boss, Gerald Wells, was at a meeting in Cheshire when she made her astonishing finding. On his return he read the report. 'I agreed with her,' he said simply. The following April further evidence emerged from a farm in Kent. Something big was happening.</p> <p>How should the Government vets deal with it? The head of pathology department at the CVL was Ray Bradley. With initial results showing that a new, potentially fatal, disease had been discovered, the initial policy was clear. Bradley sent a memo to Dr William Watson, CVL director, and Dr Brian Shreeve, director of research. This is what it said:</p> <p>'If the disease turned out to be bovine scrapie it would have severe repercussions to the export trade and possibly also for humans if for example it was discovered that humans with spongiform encephalopathies had close association with cattle. It is for these reasons that I have classified this document confidential. At present I would recommend playing it low key.'</p> <p>New cases kept dribbling in. It was suggested that information should be passed around, the usual method when new scientific discoveries are made. The veterinary journals - Vision, the in-house magazine for the Government's veterinary service, and Veterinary Record - were suggested as forums for this exhange. But permission was withdrawn. Plans to give information to universities and outside research bodies were also blocked.</p> <p>Why? By getting the information out in the public domain, there would be a greater chance of understanding what the vets were dealing with and of estimating how widespread the problem was. The reasoning by the officials was clear. 'Because of the nature of the disorder, its political implications and possible effects on exports,' said Dr Bernard Williams, head of the Government's veterinary investigation service. Cards would be played very close to the chest.</p> <p>By the end of May 1987, with Margaret Thatcher's third election victory a matter of weeks away, there were six positive cases of BSE and 13 suspected cases. It was well over two years since Bee had first set eyes on Cow 133. The problem was growing. Ministers had still not been told.</p> <p>On June 1, William Rees, the chief veterinary officer and as such one of the most powerful men in the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, wrote to Donald Thompson, MAFF's parliamentary secretary, about BSE.</p> <p>'Irresponsible or ill-informed publicity is likely to be unhelpful since it might lead to hysterical demands for immediate, draconian government measures and could lead to a rejection of UK exports,' he said.</p> <p>'It does not seem appropriate at this stage for MAFF to issue general information. The political implication are serious, particularly if not handled correctly.'</p> <p>That line became the leitmotif of the Government's response to an approaching storm. Economics were the main concern and the farming industry needed to be protected. People could be easily alarmed, the civil service thought. Better secrecy than public hysteria. By the end of August, 1987, 46 more probable cases of BSE had been identified. By the middle of September it was 73. By the end of October, 120. Farming newspapers published the first articles about an 'incurable disease wiping out dairy cows'. By the end of November, there were 243 suspected cases.</p> <p>The public were oblivious to the danger. Richard Sibley, chairman of the British Cattle Veterinary Association, said: 'Throughout most of 1986 and 1987 most veterinary surgeons who were in the front line of disease diagnosis and control were ignorant of the presence of this disease and were not informed of its clinical signs or its significance as a potential national disease problem.'</p> <p>By the end of March 1988, 600 probable cases of BSE had been reported. The Government's mind was made up: scrapie in sheep had never jumped species to man, despite being known about for 200 years. BSE wouldn't either.</p> <p>As usual, John MacGregor's red box of weekend reading was overflowing. It was February 1988 and the secretary of state for agriculture had a two busy days of meetings and business ahead.</p> <p>In his ministerial papers was a document from John Suich of MAFF's animal health division. The BSE problem was becoming serious, numbers were rising alarmingly. Suich suggested that a slaughter compensation scheme should be agreed for farmers, who were increasing disquiet about a disaster developing in their midst.</p> <p>Two months earlier, MacGregor had received a letter from Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, a landowner. 'There is nothing which prevents veterinary officers from certifying the carcass of an animal infected with this disease as fit for human consumption. I understand little research has been done on whether this disease can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of beef from infected animals. Until this is known it seems quite wrong to sell infected carcasses for this purpose.' It was the first time the public health link had been made.</p> <p>Suich's memo to MacGregor tackled the issue. 'I would be reluctant to say the risk [to human health] is negligible. One theory is that BSE may have originated from sheep affected with scrapie. If this theory is correct we have to face up to the possibility that the disease could cross another species gap.'</p> <p>This view would not be made public for another eight years. MAFF considered it too dangerous for the multi-billion pound farming industry.</p> <p>MacGregor read Suich's comments on the slaughter and compensation deal. In the margins, more as an aide-m\u00e9moire than anything else, he noted that there was a need for caution. How much would a slaughter and compensation scheme cost? Would analogies be made with other farming problems, such as rhizomania in sugar beet which was devastating crops, leaving the Government open to heavy compensation claims? Treasury was unlikely to agree to funding the scheme if there was no evidence that there was a risk to human health. For MacGregor, the former chief secretary to the Treasury, economics were of primary concern.</p> <p>MAFF officials took this to mean that the scheme was off the agenda. In a letter to the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Donald Acheson, they failed to make it clear that they urgently wanted a slaughter and compensation scheme. They simply said they wanted Acheson's thoughts on the possible health implications of BSE. Acheson himself confessed that he felt irritated at the incredibly short notice he had been given to come up with such an important opinion.</p> <p>'To be, off the cuff, asking the CMO, at a moment's notice, personally to give advice to take diseased cattle out of the food chain is a gross misunderstanding of the nature of the job,' Acheson later told the inquiry.</p> <p>His feelings were nothing compared with Dr Hilary Pickles, the principal medical officer at the Department of Health. How, she asked, was the department supposed to fulfil its role when MAFF didn't keep them informed?</p> <p>'The most serious delay was in informing DH in the first place,' she said. 'The Central Veterinary Laboratory were aware of a new disease in January 1987, they informed their ministers in June 1987 but wrote to us only on 3 March 1988, by which time they had 500 cases.' Pickles was furious. Inter-departmental jealousies meant that MAFF wanted to keep BSE within its sphere of influence.</p> <p>The civil service had fallen into what is known along the corridors of Whitehall as 'shaded-opinion'. When officials feel they know the mind of the minister, all options are couched in terms that the minister is likely to agree to. MAFF officials didn't tell Acheson of their own feelings on the issue of compensation because they thought MacGregor's mind was made up. It wasn't.</p> <p>'I am a little surprised to find significance attached to things which were an aide-m\u00e9moire to me,' MacGregor said later of his notes scribbled in the margins. On such misunderstandings are problems built. It was another five months of delay and circulating memos before the slaughter scheme was finally agreed. In that time hundreds of infected carcasses had entered the food chain.</p> <p>With Acheson and Pickles' opinions clear, Bradley knew pressure was growing on MAFF to give information more widely to the medical profession. In September 1987 he dropped a note to Watson suggesting publishing an article about BSE in the medical journal the Lancet. 'There are of course pros and cons,' Bradley said. 'What do you think?'</p> <p>Watson replied. 'Not at present. It would over-emphasise the possible link to human spongiform encephalopathies.' So the public remained ignorant.</p> <p>MAFF were determined to hold the line that beef was perfectly safe to eat. A week after Bradley's Lancet request, Rees knew that '[the DoH] are aware of the problem and have informally expressed some concern about any possible human health risks,' he wrote in a progress report to MacGregor. But less than a month later, Suich circulated this memo to press officers in case they had to answer questions on BSE.</p> <p>'Q: Can it be transmitted to humans?'</p> <p>'A: There is no evidence that it is transmissable to humans.'</p> <p>There was no evidence, but there were concerns. It was MAFF's policy not to reveal them.</p> <p>A cow's death is seldom pretty. In the Eighties most of Britain's 1,000 abbatoirs had adopted a 'production-line' system for killing, blood-letting and cutting up cows.</p> <p>Beasts ready for slaughter would arrive at a holding area. They would be lined up between metal fences, single file, and fed into a pen. A bolt would be fired into the animal's brain, followed by a pithing rod, a pronged instrument which would cause further damage to the brain and spinal cord to stop the animal kicking. Hoisted up by the hind legs, the cow's neck would be slit, the head cut off and the offal removed. Meat would then be processed in one direction, and the mass of guts and blood would go to a different department. Everything was used for either animal or human consumption.</p> <p>In October 1992, John Gummer, then the secretary of state for agriculture, was called before the agriculture select committee. Sitting before them in the House of Commons, Gummer was asked about hygiene standards for killing cattle. Reading from reports from environmental officers charged with inspecting slaughter houses, Gummer said:</p> <p>'We have real problems with our slaughter houses.' He turned to one of the officer's reports. 'Slaughter hall floor heavily soiled with blood, gut contents and other debris - no attempt to clean up between carcasses. Car cleaning brush heavily contaminated with blood and fat being used to wash carcasses. Offal rack and carcass rails encrusted with dirt. Missing windows - birds, flies and vermin entering. Effluent discharging across floor - risk of contamination.' Faeces was often found smeared over the dead bodies of the cows.</p> <p>A year earlier, Gummer had warned Prime Minister John Major that 60 per cent of slaughter houses did not meet European standards.</p> <p>It mattered. In November 1989, the Government had ordered that brains and spinal cords of cows should be prevented from entering the human food chain. Brain and spinal cord were thought to contain the infective BSE material. It became known as the specific bovine offal ban.</p> <p>The removal of the spinal cord was a tricky business. Cows had to be sawn neatly in two. The safety of the public was dependent on men with knives with electric saws and stun guns, killing and cutting up cows in chaotic conditions. There was widespread evidence that remains of spinal cords were entering the food chain, in reports given to MAFF and the DoH in 1995.</p> <p>'We asked MAFF officials whether evidence of poor hygiene standards in slaughter houses did not raise concerns about the standard of enforcement of the duty to remove the spinal cord from the carcass,' Lord Phillips said. 'Each replied that it did not.'</p> <p>Even with the evidence that the slaughter house system was filthy, MAFF and the department of healt stuck to the line that beef was perfectly safe to eat.</p> <p>On a warm pring evening in May 1990, Gerald Wells received a telephone call. It was the chief veterinary officer, Keith Meldrum. Wells, a senior member of the Central Veterinary Laboratory, was asked about his discovery of a BSE-type disease in a cat in Bristol.</p> <p>Wells said that it had 'profound implications' for the Government's line on BSE's possible effects on people. Other experts argued that if a cat had 'caught' BSE, probably from eating infected offal crushed up in pet food, people could be next. Meldrum held a meeting with Gummer at which they agreed that the Government had to hold the line. They said there was 'no likely connection' between the cat and BSE. Such stubbornness was to continue for another six years.</p> <p>Over the next three years, finding after finding undermined the foundations of the Government's policy. And every time, the Government sort to shore up its own rickety structure with assurances that beef was completely safe.</p> <p>In August 1990 scientists successfully transferred BSE to a pig. In March 1993 the Lancet reported that the first dairy farmer had died CJD, the human equivalent of BSE. That month Kenneth Calman, the chief medical officer, issued a statement saying that beef was safe to eat.</p> <p>'Dr Calman was seeking to address fears that a farmer had somehow caught BSE from his cattle,' the Phillips report says. 'Responding to such fears by emphasising that it was safe to eat beef naturally carried the inference that transmission of the disease from cow to human was impossible.</p> <p>'Dr Calman should have been careful not to suggest such a belief, for he considered that there was a real potential for BSE to move from cows to humans.'</p> <p>Then came Vicky Rimmer. Early in summer 1993 she fell ill with a degenerative disease which mystified her doctors. By mid-September she was blind and had fallen into a coma. She would become another fatal CJD statistic.</p> <p>On 26 January, 1994, press reporting of Vicky's case was causing alarm. Calman was again pressed into action with the encouragement of MAFF and made another reassuring statement. 'On the basis of the work done so far there is not the slightest evidence that eating beef or hamburgers caused CJD,' he said. Phillips said that the strength with which Calman made the point was 'somewhat more emphatic than desirable'.</p> <p>Why was Calman wheeled out so regularly? A briefing paper from Douglas Hogg, the secretary of state for agriculture in 1995, to Major reveals the thinking. 'The Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Veterinary Officer ought to be by far the most convincing spokesmen for the Government on the question of whether BSE could be transmitted to humans from infected meat.' Politicians weren't trusted, so Britain's faith in experts had to be tested to the limit.</p> <p>In the second half of 1995, two more dairy farmers died of CJD, bringing the total to four. The committee of experts brought together by the Government to advise them on BSE and CJD said they were now looking at something greater than a chance phenomenon. One official suggested that maybe the farmers had eaten the infected cattle feed they were giving to their herds. Holding the line was getting difficult.</p> <p>Another blow came. Two more teenagers had been diagnosed with CJD. The media smelt scandal. Confidence had to be rebuilt, ministers had to go on the attack.</p> <p>In December, Stephen Dorrell, the health secretary, appeared on Jonathan Dimbleby's ITV political programme on ITV to do just that.</p> <p>'So there is no conceivable risk from what is now in the food chain?' Dimbleby asked. Dorrell thought about his reply carefully, mindful that a word out of place could bring the Government's policy down around his ears. 'That is the position,' he said. Dorrell admitted later that his words 'had gone too far'.</p> <p>Hogg was worried. Public confidence in beef was taking a battering. He demanded a campaign to convince the public that eating beef was safe. He asked the scientific committee of advisers, supposedly independent, to answer a series of questions. 'This was not because he wished to know the answers,' Lord Phillips said. 'It was in the hope that the answers would be suitable to publish in order to give reassurance to those who are worried about the safety of eating beef.'</p> <p>Colin MacLean, the director general of the Meat and Livestock Commission, wrote to one of the committee, Dr Richard Kimberlin.</p> <p>'We agree that we need succinct answers to these questions and my colleagues in our PR company have drafted the sort of answers they would like to see (although they cannot put words into [the committee's] mouth!).'</p> <p>The MLC is charged with promoting beef in Britain. Kimberlin, a government adviser, was also a paid consultant for the MLC. Phillips says of MacLean's reassuring words on the safety of eating beef that 'hyperbole had replaced accuracy'.</p> <p>The rows were beginning. As more and more cases of CJD appeared, the DoH was getting increasingly nervous. But to keep the beef industry and exports from collapse MAFF ploughed on.</p> <p>By the end of February 1996, just a month before Hogg had to get up in the Commons and announce a link between BSE and a new form of CJD in people, MAFF prepared a leaflet to reassure the public. On the front page it stated: 'Two facts should be made absolutely clear. Fact 1: there is currently no scientific evidence to indicate a link between BSE and CJD. Fact 2: the independent expert committee set up to advise the Government on all aspects of BSE is satisfied that British beef is safe to eat.'</p> <p>Dr Ailsa Wight, a department of health expert on BSE, was shown the leaflet and was asked whether the DoH might like to jointly issue it with MAFF. Wight passed the request on to Dr Jeremy Metters, the deputy chief medical officer. He was furious.</p> <p>'Some statements are too definite and in time may be seen to be wrong,' he wrote in a memo to Wight. 'We should not follow MAFF's hyperbole of reassurance. We must leave ministers and CMO in particular an escape route if any of these statements turns out to be WRONG.'</p> <p>As the inter-departmental battles intensified, the number of young people catching CJD was increasing. Dr Robert Will, the leading expert in CJD from the Government supported CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, had depressing news. These cases of CJD were unlike any other. There was something going on.</p> <p>On a damp evening early in March, 1996, Richard Packer, the permanent secretary at MAFF, walked into Hogg's cavernous office on the corner of Smith Square in Westminster. It was late, but Packer had some bad news. 'There is a very dark cloud on the horizon,' he told Hogg. 'SEAC [the Government advisory committee] think, or are coming to the view, that BSE might be transmissible.'</p> <p>Hogg paused as the import of what Packer was saying sunk in. 'This is a very serious state of affairs,' he said.</p> <p>Calman was told. Meldrum was told. Beef was not safe. Hogg prepared to make a statement to Parliament as soon as possible. If this leaked out, the Government would be finished. It was agreed that Dorrell would make the first statement and Hogg would follow. For the first time in the whole disaster, the considerations of the DoH were put ahead of those of MAFF.</p> <p>On 20 March, at 3.31pm, Dorrell rose from the green Government benches in the Commons chamber. He said that a new form of CJD had been discovered and that, despite there being no firm scientific evidence that it had come from eating beef, SEAC concluded that the cases were linked to eating infected meat in the Eighties.</p> <p>At 4.17pm, Hogg made his statement, saying that all cattle over 30 months would be slaughtered. In that one day billions of pounds were wiped off the value of Britain's beef industry. Incinerators worked night and day burning cattle. Pictures of bovine funeral pyres led the news day after day as hundreds of herds were burnt. Farmers were ruined. Many have never recovered.</p> <p>The Government had finally been caught out. From day one, convinced by the theory that scrapie had never been transmitted to man from sheep, and that therefore BSE could not be transmitted either, they drew a line in the sand and refused to cross it. Even when the scrapie theory was proved wrong - BSE actually came from a genetic mutation in cattle in the Seventies and was passed on by feeding cow remains to herds as animal feed - they refused to budge.</p> <p>Economics guided them. The public could not be trusted to make up their own mind. Science found it impossible to prove a link, so there was always an opportunity for more research. More delay and more reassuring noises.</p> <p>Eventually the weight of evidence overwhelmed the Government's defences. But even at the very last, there were those arguing that a cattle cull could be 'disproportionately expensive' given the number of cases of CJD (then 10). These were men trying to bale out out the Titanic with a teaspoon.</p> <p>Sixty miles away, David Bee must have greeted the news with horror. On a cold Christmas in 1984 he had created the first ripple of a gathering storm which eventually engulfed the nation. And in Aberdeen, Billy McIntyre still makes the 10 minute journey to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary to tousle his daughter's hair. Anything to keep her happy until she dies from a disease that started in cattle and is now eating her brain.</p> <p><b>The key unanswered questions</b></p> <p><b>Why does vCJD predominantly affect young people?</b></p> <p>A possible explanation is the disproportionate consumption by young people of beefburgers, some of which contain high-risk material. There is also a higher incidence of affections such as tonsilitis or gastroenteritis in children giving rise to transmission through broken skin or mucous membranes; and transmission via childhood vaccines prepared in cultures containing bovine constituents.</p> <p><b>How many more people will succumb to vCJD?</b></p> <p>Estimates of the size of an epidemic are made difficult by the many unknowns. Scientists do not know enough about dose, route of exposure, incubation period, genetic susceptibility and scale of the species barrier between cattle and humans. Latest estimates range from a few hundred to just over 130,000.</p> <p><b>What was the origin of BSE?</b></p> <p>Lord Phillips believe we may never know for certain how and why BSE first appeared. The best guess is that a sporadic form of the disease probably occurred in the 1970s through some type of freak genetic dysfunction. The epidemic happened because remains of individual diseased cattle were ground up and fed back to healthy animals.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><br><a href=\"http://www.bse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE Inquiry</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.bsereview.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Food Standards Agency BSE Review</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">MAFF BSE site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/cjd\" target=\"_NEW\">Department of Health BSE/CJD site</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.humanbse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Human BSE Foundation - voluntary support group</a><br> <a href=\"http://sparc.airtime.co.uk/bse\" target=\"_NEW\">BSE news and research</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Billy McIntyre tried to stick to his routine on Wednesday night. At about 7pm he left his terraced house on a quiet estate in the north of Aberdeen and made the 10-minute journey up the hill to the city's royal infirmary. For an hour and a half he sat with his daughter Donna, aged 21, who has been in hospital since being diagnosed with new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in September. As usual, he chatted with her, tickled her, and tousled her hair to keep her animated. When he returned home he could not stomach the thought of dinner. He made do with a cup of tea, and tried to concentrate on the television. At 8am the next day, McIntyre rose, washed and dressed before going into the kitchen for some breakfast. He turned on the radio and waited. It was a long, slow morning. At 12.32pm, Nick Brown, the agriculture secretary, rose to announce publication of the public inquiry into Britain's BSE epidemic. 'I was emotional all the way through the announcement,' McIntyre said. 'I was crying a lot. Some of that was relief that the answers were coming out. But mainly it was anger because the report was so damning. I'm not going to congratulate ministers on this report because the whole thing should never have been allowed to happen. I don't even accept their apology.' McIntyre's daughter will be dead in months. David Bee had never seen anything like it. The cow was arching its back, waving its head from side to side. It was pitifully thin. His colleague, Mike Teale, had told him of being chased by a similarly afflicted beast which had 'chased him across the box on her knees'. It was three days before Christmas, 1984. Bee, a well-known local vet, had been called to Pitsham Farm on the South Downs by its owner, Peter Stent. Stent was worried. One of his cows was ill. He had no idea what it was. When Bee arrived, he was not sure what to think. Maybe there was a local problem with mercury poisoning Stent's herd. Maybe it was a kidney disease. Nobody knew then, but Stent's sick animal would soon become famous as 'Cow 133'. In the heart of farming country, Bee was staring into the eyes of a disaster. He never expected a walk-on part in the story of Britain's biggest public health scandal. Most of the locals knew him as an enthusiastic 'joiner-in' at church in his picturesque village of West Liss. His bright tone made him a favourite when it came to reading out passages from the Bible. Cow 133 was the first case of BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Sixteen years and sixteen volumes of public inquiry later, the Government stands accused of failing the public. Bureaucracy, caution and secrecy has led, slowly and painfully, to the realisation that the structures in place to protect the people had simply not worked. Last week, Lord Phillips' report into how a disease in cows became a tragedy for humans shone a light into the deepest recesses of government operation. Debate so far has focused on the surface story, the missed opportunities and confused messages which allowed an ugly sore to fester. That story was contained in Volume 1 of Lord Phillips' inquiry. But there are 15 other volumes, thousands of pages of memos and secret deals, legal challenges and stand-up rows that reveal how government really works - and not always work in the public's interest. Not since the Scott inquiry into the Arms to Iraq affair has Britain seen such a damning indictment of its public 'servants'. Carol Richardson had just returned from holiday in September 1995. A pathologist at the government's Central Veterinary Laboratory, she was asked to study the brain of an adult cow from Pitsham Farm, one that Bee had seen. After looking at slides of the brain she confirmed that it showed characteristics of a 'spongiform encephalopathy', BSE. It was the start. Richardson sought a second opinion from a colleague, Dr Martin Jeffrey. She left the slides on his work bench in the laboratory and went to lunch. On her return, Jeffrey had left a note by one of the slides. 'Bovine scrapie' he wrote, referring to the BSE-type disease common in sheep. Richardson's boss, Gerald Wells, was at a meeting in Cheshire when she made her astonishing finding. On his return he read the report. 'I agreed with her,' he said simply. The following April further evidence emerged from a farm in Kent. Something big was happening. How should the Government vets deal with it? The head of pathology department at the CVL was Ray Bradley. With initial results showing that a new, potentially fatal, disease had been discovered, the initial policy was clear. Bradley sent a memo to Dr William Watson, CVL director, and Dr Brian Shreeve, director of research. This is what it said: 'If the disease turned out to be bovine scrapie it would have severe repercussions to the export trade and possibly also for humans if for example it was discovered that humans with spongiform encephalopathies had close association with cattle. It is for these reasons that I have classified this document confidential. At present I would recommend playing it low key.' New cases kept dribbling in. It was suggested that information should be passed around, the usual method when new scientific discoveries are made. The veterinary journals - Vision, the in-house magazine for the Government's veterinary service, and Veterinary Record - were suggested as forums for this exhange. But permission was withdrawn. Plans to give information to universities and outside research bodies were also blocked. Why? By getting the information out in the public domain, there would be a greater chance of understanding what the vets were dealing with and of estimating how widespread the problem was. The reasoning by the officials was clear. 'Because of the nature of the disorder, its political implications and possible effects on exports,' said Dr Bernard Williams, head of the Government's veterinary investigation service. Cards would be played very close to the chest. By the end of May 1987, with Margaret Thatcher's third election victory a matter of weeks away, there were six positive cases of BSE and 13 suspected cases. It was well over two years since Bee had first set eyes on Cow 133. The problem was growing. Ministers had still not been told. On June 1, William Rees, the chief veterinary officer and as such one of the most powerful men in the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, wrote to Donald Thompson, MAFF's parliamentary secretary, about BSE. 'Irresponsible or ill-informed publicity is likely to be unhelpful since it might lead to hysterical demands for immediate, draconian government measures and could lead to a rejection of UK exports,' he said. 'It does not seem appropriate at this stage for MAFF to issue general information. The political implication are serious, particularly if not handled correctly.' That line became the leitmotif of the Government's response to an approaching storm. Economics were the main concern and the farming industry needed to be protected. People could be easily alarmed, the civil service thought. Better secrecy than public hysteria. By the end of August, 1987, 46 more probable cases of BSE had been identified. By the middle of September it was 73. By the end of October, 120. Farming newspapers published the first articles about an 'incurable disease wiping out dairy cows'. By the end of November, there were 243 suspected cases. The public were oblivious to the danger. Richard Sibley, chairman of the British Cattle Veterinary Association, said: 'Throughout most of 1986 and 1987 most veterinary surgeons who were in the front line of disease diagnosis and control were ignorant of the presence of this disease and were not informed of its clinical signs or its significance as a potential national disease problem.' By the end of March 1988, 600 probable cases of BSE had been reported. The Government's mind was made up: scrapie in sheep had never jumped species to man, despite being known about for 200 years. BSE wouldn't either. As usual, John MacGregor's red box of weekend reading was overflowing. It was February 1988 and the secretary of state for agriculture had a two busy days of meetings and business ahead. In his ministerial papers was a document from John Suich of MAFF's animal health division. The BSE problem was becoming serious, numbers were rising alarmingly. Suich suggested that a slaughter compensation scheme should be agreed for farmers, who were increasing disquiet about a disaster developing in their midst. Two months earlier, MacGregor had received a letter from Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, a landowner. 'There is nothing which prevents veterinary officers from certifying the carcass of an animal infected with this disease as fit for human consumption. I understand little research has been done on whether this disease can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of beef from infected animals. Until this is known it seems quite wrong to sell infected carcasses for this purpose.' It was the first time the public health link had been made. Suich's memo to MacGregor tackled the issue. 'I would be reluctant to say the risk [to human health] is negligible. One theory is that BSE may have originated from sheep affected with scrapie. If this theory is correct we have to face up to the possibility that the disease could cross another species gap.' This view would not be made public for another eight years. MAFF considered it too dangerous for the multi-billion pound farming industry. MacGregor read Suich's comments on the slaughter and compensation deal. In the margins, more as an aide-m\u00e9moire than anything else, he noted that there was a need for caution. How much would a slaughter and compensation scheme cost? Would analogies be made with other farming problems, such as rhizomania in sugar beet which was devastating crops, leaving the Government open to heavy compensation claims? Treasury was unlikely to agree to funding the scheme if there was no evidence that there was a risk to human health. For MacGregor, the former chief secretary to the Treasury, economics were of primary concern. MAFF officials took this to mean that the scheme was off the agenda. In a letter to the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Donald Acheson, they failed to make it clear that they urgently wanted a slaughter and compensation scheme. They simply said they wanted Acheson's thoughts on the possible health implications of BSE. Acheson himself confessed that he felt irritated at the incredibly short notice he had been given to come up with such an important opinion. 'To be, off the cuff, asking the CMO, at a moment's notice, personally to give advice to take diseased cattle out of the food chain is a gross misunderstanding of the nature of the job,' Acheson later told the inquiry. His feelings were nothing compared with Dr Hilary Pickles, the principal medical officer at the Department of Health. How, she asked, was the department supposed to fulfil its role when MAFF didn't keep them informed? 'The most serious delay was in informing DH in the first place,' she said. 'The Central Veterinary Laboratory were aware of a new disease in January 1987, they informed their ministers in June 1987 but wrote to us only on 3 March 1988, by which time they had 500 cases.' Pickles was furious. Inter-departmental jealousies meant that MAFF wanted to keep BSE within its sphere of influence. The civil service had fallen into what is known along the corridors of Whitehall as 'shaded-opinion'. When officials feel they know the mind of the minister, all options are couched in terms that the minister is likely to agree to. MAFF officials didn't tell Acheson of their own feelings on the issue of compensation because they thought MacGregor's mind was made up. It wasn't. 'I am a little surprised to find significance attached to things which were an aide-m\u00e9moire to me,' MacGregor said later of his notes scribbled in the margins. On such misunderstandings are problems built. It was another five months of delay and circulating memos before the slaughter scheme was finally agreed. In that time hundreds of infected carcasses had entered the food chain. With Acheson and Pickles' opinions clear, Bradley knew pressure was growing on MAFF to give information more widely to the medical profession. In September 1987 he dropped a note to Watson suggesting publishing an article about BSE in the medical journal the Lancet. 'There are of course pros and cons,' Bradley said. 'What do you think?' Watson replied. 'Not at present. It would over-emphasise the possible link to human spongiform encephalopathies.' So the public remained ignorant. MAFF were determined to hold the line that beef was perfectly safe to eat. A week after Bradley's Lancet request, Rees knew that '[the DoH] are aware of the problem and have informally expressed some concern about any possible human health risks,' he wrote in a progress report to MacGregor. But less than a month later, Suich circulated this memo to press officers in case they had to answer questions on BSE. 'Q: Can it be transmitted to humans?' 'A: There is no evidence that it is transmissable to humans.' There was no evidence, but there were concerns. It was MAFF's policy not to reveal them. A cow's death is seldom pretty. In the Eighties most of Britain's 1,000 abbatoirs had adopted a 'production-line' system for killing, blood-letting and cutting up cows. Beasts ready for slaughter would arrive at a holding area. They would be lined up between metal fences, single file, and fed into a pen. A bolt would be fired into the animal's brain, followed by a pithing rod, a pronged instrument which would cause further damage to the brain and spinal cord to stop the animal kicking. Hoisted up by the hind legs, the cow's neck would be slit, the head cut off and the offal removed. Meat would then be processed in one direction, and the mass of guts and blood would go to a different department. Everything was used for either animal or human consumption. In October 1992, John Gummer, then the secretary of state for agriculture, was called before the agriculture select committee. Sitting before them in the House of Commons, Gummer was asked about hygiene standards for killing cattle. Reading from reports from environmental officers charged with inspecting slaughter houses, Gummer said: 'We have real problems with our slaughter houses.' He turned to one of the officer's reports. 'Slaughter hall floor heavily soiled with blood, gut contents and other debris - no attempt to clean up between carcasses. Car cleaning brush heavily contaminated with blood and fat being used to wash carcasses. Offal rack and carcass rails encrusted with dirt. Missing windows - birds, flies and vermin entering. Effluent discharging across floor - risk of contamination.' Faeces was often found smeared over the dead bodies of the cows. A year earlier, Gummer had warned Prime Minister John Major that 60 per cent of slaughter houses did not meet European standards. It mattered. In November 1989, the Government had ordered that brains and spinal cords of cows should be prevented from entering the human food chain. Brain and spinal cord were thought to contain the infective BSE material. It became known as the specific bovine offal ban. The removal of the spinal cord was a tricky business. Cows had to be sawn neatly in two. The safety of the public was dependent on men with knives with electric saws and stun guns, killing and cutting up cows in chaotic conditions. There was widespread evidence that remains of spinal cords were entering the food chain, in reports given to MAFF and the DoH in 1995. 'We asked MAFF officials whether evidence of poor hygiene standards in slaughter houses did not raise concerns about the standard of enforcement of the duty to remove the spinal cord from the carcass,' Lord Phillips said. 'Each replied that it did not.' Even with the evidence that the slaughter house system was filthy, MAFF and the department of healt stuck to the line that beef was perfectly safe to eat. On a warm pring evening in May 1990, Gerald Wells received a telephone call. It was the chief veterinary officer, Keith Meldrum. Wells, a senior member of the Central Veterinary Laboratory, was asked about his discovery of a BSE-type disease in a cat in Bristol. Wells said that it had 'profound implications' for the Government's line on BSE's possible effects on people. Other experts argued that if a cat had 'caught' BSE, probably from eating infected offal crushed up in pet food, people could be next. Meldrum held a meeting with Gummer at which they agreed that the Government had to hold the line. They said there was 'no likely connection' between the cat and BSE. Such stubbornness was to continue for another six years. Over the next three years, finding after finding undermined the foundations of the Government's policy. And every time, the Government sort to shore up its own rickety structure with assurances that beef was completely safe. In August 1990 scientists successfully transferred BSE to a pig. In March 1993 the Lancet reported that the first dairy farmer had died CJD, the human equivalent of BSE. That month Kenneth Calman, the chief medical officer, issued a statement saying that beef was safe to eat. 'Dr Calman was seeking to address fears that a farmer had somehow caught BSE from his cattle,' the Phillips report says. 'Responding to such fears by emphasising that it was safe to eat beef naturally carried the inference that transmission of the disease from cow to human was impossible. 'Dr Calman should have been careful not to suggest such a belief, for he considered that there was a real potential for BSE to move from cows to humans.' Then came Vicky Rimmer. Early in summer 1993 she fell ill with a degenerative disease which mystified her doctors. By mid-September she was blind and had fallen into a coma. She would become another fatal CJD statistic. On 26 January, 1994, press reporting of Vicky's case was causing alarm. Calman was again pressed into action with the encouragement of MAFF and made another reassuring statement. 'On the basis of the work done so far there is not the slightest evidence that eating beef or hamburgers caused CJD,' he said. Phillips said that the strength with which Calman made the point was 'somewhat more emphatic than desirable'. Why was Calman wheeled out so regularly? A briefing paper from Douglas Hogg, the secretary of state for agriculture in 1995, to Major reveals the thinking. 'The Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Veterinary Officer ought to be by far the most convincing spokesmen for the Government on the question of whether BSE could be transmitted to humans from infected meat.' Politicians weren't trusted, so Britain's faith in experts had to be tested to the limit. In the second half of 1995, two more dairy farmers died of CJD, bringing the total to four. The committee of experts brought together by the Government to advise them on BSE and CJD said they were now looking at something greater than a chance phenomenon. One official suggested that maybe the farmers had eaten the infected cattle feed they were giving to their herds. Holding the line was getting difficult. Another blow came. Two more teenagers had been diagnosed with CJD. The media smelt scandal. Confidence had to be rebuilt, ministers had to go on the attack. In December, Stephen Dorrell, the health secretary, appeared on Jonathan Dimbleby's ITV political programme on ITV to do just that. 'So there is no conceivable risk from what is now in the food chain?' Dimbleby asked. Dorrell thought about his reply carefully, mindful that a word out of place could bring the Government's policy down around his ears. 'That is the position,' he said. Dorrell admitted later that his words 'had gone too far'. Hogg was worried. Public confidence in beef was taking a battering. He demanded a campaign to convince the public that eating beef was safe. He asked the scientific committee of advisers, supposedly independent, to answer a series of questions. 'This was not because he wished to know the answers,' Lord Phillips said. 'It was in the hope that the answers would be suitable to publish in order to give reassurance to those who are worried about the safety of eating beef.' Colin MacLean, the director general of the Meat and Livestock Commission, wrote to one of the committee, Dr Richard Kimberlin. 'We agree that we need succinct answers to these questions and my colleagues in our PR company have drafted the sort of answers they would like to see (although they cannot put words into [the committee's] mouth!).' The MLC is charged with promoting beef in Britain. Kimberlin, a government adviser, was also a paid consultant for the MLC. Phillips says of MacLean's reassuring words on the safety of eating beef that 'hyperbole had replaced accuracy'. The rows were beginning. As more and more cases of CJD appeared, the DoH was getting increasingly nervous. But to keep the beef industry and exports from collapse MAFF ploughed on. By the end of February 1996, just a month before Hogg had to get up in the Commons and announce a link between BSE and a new form of CJD in people, MAFF prepared a leaflet to reassure the public. On the front page it stated: 'Two facts should be made absolutely clear. Fact 1: there is currently no scientific evidence to indicate a link between BSE and CJD. Fact 2: the independent expert committee set up to advise the Government on all aspects of BSE is satisfied that British beef is safe to eat.' Dr Ailsa Wight, a department of health expert on BSE, was shown the leaflet and was asked whether the DoH might like to jointly issue it with MAFF. Wight passed the request on to Dr Jeremy Metters, the deputy chief medical officer. He was furious. 'Some statements are too definite and in time may be seen to be wrong,' he wrote in a memo to Wight. 'We should not follow MAFF's hyperbole of reassurance. We must leave ministers and CMO in particular an escape route if any of these statements turns out to be WRONG.' As the inter-departmental battles intensified, the number of young people catching CJD was increasing. Dr Robert Will, the leading expert in CJD from the Government supported CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh, had depressing news. These cases of CJD were unlike any other. There was something going on. On a damp evening early in March, 1996, Richard Packer, the permanent secretary at MAFF, walked into Hogg's cavernous office on the corner of Smith Square in Westminster. It was late, but Packer had some bad news. 'There is a very dark cloud on the horizon,' he told Hogg. 'SEAC [the Government advisory committee] think, or are coming to the view, that BSE might be transmissible.' Hogg paused as the import of what Packer was saying sunk in. 'This is a very serious state of affairs,' he said. Calman was told. Meldrum was told. Beef was not safe. Hogg prepared to make a statement to Parliament as soon as possible. If this leaked out, the Government would be finished. It was agreed that Dorrell would make the first statement and Hogg would follow. For the first time in the whole disaster, the considerations of the DoH were put ahead of those of MAFF. On 20 March, at 3.31pm, Dorrell rose from the green Government benches in the Commons chamber. He said that a new form of CJD had been discovered and that, despite there being no firm scientific evidence that it had come from eating beef, SEAC concluded that the cases were linked to eating infected meat in the Eighties. At 4.17pm, Hogg made his statement, saying that all cattle over 30 months would be slaughtered. In that one day billions of pounds were wiped off the value of Britain's beef industry. Incinerators worked night and day burning cattle. Pictures of bovine funeral pyres led the news day after day as hundreds of herds were burnt. Farmers were ruined. Many have never recovered. The Government had finally been caught out. From day one, convinced by the theory that scrapie had never been transmitted to man from sheep, and that therefore BSE could not be transmitted either, they drew a line in the sand and refused to cross it. Even when the scrapie theory was proved wrong - BSE actually came from a genetic mutation in cattle in the Seventies and was passed on by feeding cow remains to herds as animal feed - they refused to budge. Economics guided them. The public could not be trusted to make up their own mind. Science found it impossible to prove a link, so there was always an opportunity for more research. More delay and more reassuring noises. Eventually the weight of evidence overwhelmed the Government's defences. But even at the very last, there were those arguing that a cattle cull could be 'disproportionately expensive' given the number of cases of CJD (then 10). These were men trying to bale out out the Titanic with a teaspoon. Sixty miles away, David Bee must have greeted the news with horror. On a cold Christmas in 1984 he had created the first ripple of a gathering storm which eventually engulfed the nation. And in Aberdeen, Billy McIntyre still makes the 10 minute journey to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary to tousle his daughter's hair. Anything to keep her happy until she dies from a disease that started in cattle and is now eating her brain. The key unanswered questions Why does vCJD predominantly affect young people? A possible explanation is the disproportionate consumption by young people of beefburgers, some of which contain high-risk material. There is also a higher incidence of affections such as tonsilitis or gastroenteritis in children giving rise to transmission through broken skin or mucous membranes; and transmission via childhood vaccines prepared in cultures containing bovine constituents. How many more people will succumb to vCJD? Estimates of the size of an epidemic are made difficult by the many unknowns. Scientists do not know enough about dose, route of exposure, incubation period, genetic susceptibility and scale of the species barrier between cattle and humans. Latest estimates range from a few hundred to just over 130,000. What was the origin of BSE? Lord Phillips believe we may never know for certain how and why BSE first appeared. The best guess is that a sporadic form of the disease probably occurred in the 1970s through some type of freak genetic dysfunction. The epidemic happened because remains of individual diseased cattle were ground up and fed back to healthy animals.

He doesn't drink, smoke or take drugs, is a published author and a veritable charmer who by the end of the year will be \u00a3200,000 better off. There is just one catch. Martin McGartland is an IRA informer who, after surviving two murder attempts, admits he will be looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life. The botched attempt on McGartland's life in Whitley Bay, Tyne &amp; Wear, 18 months ago has turned out to be one of the most lucrative bungled assassinations in Irish or British history. Legal sources close to the former IRA volunteer-turned-police-agent have told The Observer he is likely to net more than \u00a3200,000 due to a raft of inaccurate reports immediately following the attempted murder on 17 June last year. The 30-year-old west Belfast man, now living under a new identity in England, has successfully sued a range of Irish and British newspapers. They reported at the time of the shooting that he was targeted by a North-east England drugs gang with which he was in dispute rather than his old IRA comrades. So far McGartland, who was regarded as one of the RUC's most important agents inside the IRA's Belfast Brigade during the early Nineties, has sued the Daily Mail , Independent , Financial Times, Daily Record, London Evening Standard, Irish Independent and Irish Sunday Independent . Several of the papers have been forced to publish apologies over their allegations linking him to drugs gangs, and a number have paid large out-of-court settlements to a fugitive who just 10 months ago was living in a police cell in Northumbria.

The IRA murdered Fegan, a bejewelled, bon viveur drugs baron who defied republican threats in the Irish border town. Speaking from a secret location in England yesterday, McGartland said he was perplexed over what to do with his libel windfall. He refuses to discuss the exact amount he has taken from newspapers.

      "body": "<p>If nothing else, the British could always pride themselves on their system of government. Here was and is the repository of informed but representative parliamentary debate, holding the executive branch of government to account like no other. Its democratic legitimacy was doubly assured by the benediction of monarch and lords, its well-oiled, impartial and orderly civil service the acme of high-quality administration. While other countries endured revolutions, written constitutions and poor government, Britain, whatever its other problems, was endowed with a practical system of good governance.</p> <p>This last week has once again underlined how hollow that claim is. The BSE crisis has created a trust gap between the public and their governors that will not be readily closed; the Phillips inquiry has revealed the degree of inbuilt official secrecy that lay behind a decade of bungled decision-making which the public properly suspect.</p> <p>But paradoxically, the inquiry itself, failing cruelly to draw the tough conclusions from its own fastidious analysis, revealed another weakness of the British system - the quixotic, ad hoc nature of judge-led public inquiries whose results reflect the personal character of their chair and whose recommendations the government of the day, exercising its prerogative and secretive powers, may or may not accept. And be sure the officials who recommended Phillips for the job knew very well he could be relied upon to pull his punches. It's a classic case of the accused appointing their own judge, and typical of what you get in a system that is congenitally closed with appallingly weak checks and balances.</p> <p>Yet while the British learned of the inadequacies of their civil service, they had yet further proof of our systemic inability to provide public goods or serve the public interest. The rail system imploded. A rushed and barely scrutinised privatisation around a structure calculated to minimise efficiency while increasing safety risks has been overlaid on a generation of underinvestment to produce what we have today - a network where the mass of broken and cracked rails is so serious that after the Hatfield disaster rail travel has become a lottery of closed lines and chronic delays. Successive governments' refusals to confront reality, invest or take care of their people has finally come home to roost.</p> <p>The issue is not that we now possess a blame culture which fosters an impossible public demand for risk-free travel or risk-free eating, the gut reaction of some, especially on the Right, which allows them to conclude that the system of governance can be excused its manifest shortcomings. For them, the problem is, instead, the people.</p> <p>But the public know that human error or exogenous acts of God will hit any system, however well designed. What makes us angry is not the discovery that there are risks; rather, it is what they reveal about our attitudes to upholding the public interest.</p> <p>The British provision of public goods - whether rail travel or protection of food standards - is structurally poor and the willingness to disclose information even poorer. We begin from a low standard of service, and when things go wrong the response is typically belated, inadequate and cheapskate.</p> <p>The public interest, always a weak concept in Britain, has become even feebler after a generation of castigation of the state and all its works. Yet the state is all that we have to represent the commonwealth. There is a public interest that is analytically separate from private interests, and which any good society must embody and represent. Individuals certainly want to be free to exercise their choices and spend as much of what they earn as they can, but they also understand that there is a public realm that needs defending, asserting and funding and is no less central to their prosperity and well-being.</p> <p>Put more baldly, the public do not accept that government is universally and always a 'bad thing'; rather, they admit that there is a legitimate role for the state, even if their experience of what government provides makes them believe with growing passion that it needs to be more accountable, more effective and more intelligent.</p> <p>This is what lay behind the call for constitutional reform embraced by the Labour leader, John Smith, but only half-heartedly endorsed by his successors. It was always a call for institutional modernisation and, via that, a means to recast the legitimacy of government and the self-confidence of those who serve it.</p> <p>Yet, in power, New Labour has been half-hearted, launching a programme of constitutional reform that has been careful to protect as much of the old - its prerogative powers, its centralisation, its secrecy, its executive discretion - as possible. Freedom of information or House of Lords reform, while welcome, have been compromised by the same unwillingness to challenge the unsound fundamentals on which the system is built.</p> <p>This has not been a programme of modernisation located in a narrative about the necessity to rebuild the state for new times; rather, it has been a series of hard fought and grudging concessions that leaves much of the basic constitutional template in place.</p> <p>It will not do. The proposed Freedom of Information Act, for example, will leave the disclosure of advice and factual information at the ultimate discretion of Ministers, who will also be the arbiters for the release of reports from safety authorities such as the Health and Safety Executive or Maff inspectors. The disfiguring culture of secrecy which permitted civil servants to delay their warnings about BSE will remain substantially in place.</p> <p>As needy of reform is the system of independent, judge-led inquiries. We need an independent inquiry commission that will choose chairs from a standing panel, taking the selection away from the discretion of Ministers and civil servants whose failures are to be scrutinised. Inquiries should last no longer than a year and the presumption should be that their recommendations should be followed - or the Government must explain why not. There were eight inquiries into unsafe football grounds before the recommendations of the Hillsborough inquiry in 1989 were finally followed; there was no inquiry into the Marchioness disaster; the inquiry into Heathrow's Terminal 5 has lasted an absurd four years. Now we have had an inquiry into BSE priding itself on its refusal to hold individuals to account for their actions. It is time to make the whole inquiry process systematic and properly independent.</p> <p>And while the planned government build-up of investment in the rail system is impressive, there is still an unwillingness to assert a public interest if it implies public ownership or direction. A venture capitalist would want an equity stake in the system in return for this scale of support; but not the British Government. That would be statist, or worse socialist - so low has our conception of the public interest fallen.</p> <p>What is required is constitutional innovation in the service of relegitimising government. One of New Labour's more convinced constitutional reforms was giving the Bank of England independence along with disclosing the minutes of its meetings, an initiative which has delivered a sound and credible monetary policy without the roof falling in on those who make it.</p> <p>Try to extend the principle to the heartland of government and resistance begins. The whole edifice rests on the presumption that the executive branch - Ministers and officials - exercises executive discretion on behalf of the Crown, while they are accountable through Parliament to the people, a twin source of authority that is thought to bolster the legitimacy and effectiveness of government, but which is now undermining it. All executive power must be exercised on behalf of the people - and the elements of monarchical prerogative have to go.</p> <p>Yet this seems an almost impossible nut to crack. Whether it's the procedures in the House of Commons or the practicalities of appointing a chair to a judicial inquiry, the system stands or falls as a whole. This is a House of Commons, after all, that still insists that every MP's coat peg has a small pink ribbon in which they can hang their sword. In this atmosphere, it is as hard to imagine an elected second chamber as it is the notion that the public has a right to information, with the presumption being on those in power to demonstrate that it should remain secret, rather than the other way round.</p> <p>Reform is inevitable. The Scottish Parliament is advancing a proper Freedom of Information Act, and the Welsh Cabinet now releases its minutes - on the Bank of England model - six weeks after the meetings take place. The great national departments of state will no longer be able to behave as they did. The trust gap opening up between the public and their governors over food and transport is not isolated. The NHS, for example, is suffering an epidemic of medical negligence suits, while the National Plan this summer called for patients to have more information as part of an entrenchment of the Patients' Charter.</p> <p>But although the National Plan paid lip service to the idea that accountability had to be improved and decision-making delegated, Health Secretary Alan Milburn has proved the great centraliser and eliminator of checks and balances. He used his prerogative powers summarily to abolish the patients' watchdog, the Community Health Councils, replacing sustained local scrutiny with a flimsy system of twice-yearly appearances by NHS trust chief executives before local authority committees. Both could have co-existed, but that would have implied too great a challenge to executive authority.</p> <p>The self-evident truth is that the British system of government is wanting. The great sleeping bear of British politics, the demand for more accountability, is being roused at ever greater speed. Nor is this just a demand for knowledge and information; it reflects itself in the demand for more responsive and better provision of public services, which, paradoxically, will be improved, not reduced, by more openness.</p> <p>The air is thick with apologies over both BSE and transport, but we want more than saying sorry. The reason why the Conservatives remain so weak is that the public memory is long. It is a window of opportunity in which Labour can act or they, like their predecessors, will be reduced one day to being another apologising party. But to act requires conviction; instead, irresolution holds.</p>",

The meal and bonemeal was exported after March 1988, when the Government realised that feed made from slaughtered animals was the probable cause of the BSE epidemic in UK cattle. In July that year, the Government banned its use in Britain, and a week later officially informed the European Union, then the EEC, of its fears. But it wasn't until March 1996, eight years later, that a worldwide ban on the export of MBM, as it was called, came into force. No one knows how many cattle fed on the meal in those countries may now be incubating BSE. According to figures released by HM Customs and Excise, by 1989 the UK was exporting about 25,000 tonnes of MBM to EU countries and about 7,000 tonnes to nations outside Europe mostly in the Middle East and Africa. By 1991, sales of MBM to Europe dropped to zero. At the same time exports of MBM to the Third World had soared to 30,000 tonnes. Countries that continued to buy British MBM included Czechoslovakia, Nigeria, Thailand, South Africa, Kenya, Turkey, Liberia, Lebanon, Puerto Rico and Sri Lanka. Memos and minutes uncovered in the BSE inquiry reveal that the question of whether Britain should ban exports to non-EU countries led to ministerial arguments between John MacGregor and John Gummer inside the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food as well as a row between MAFF and the Department of Health. On 15 June 1989 chief veterinary officer Keith Meldrum wrote to the president of the British Cattle Veterinary Association saying: 'We do not consider it morally indefensible to export meat and bone to other countries since it may be used for feeding to pigs and poultry.' In January 1990, chief medical officer Sir Donald Acheson wrote to Meldrum warning him of the risks. He said: 'We should take steps to prevent these UK products being fed to ruminants in other countries... Unless such action is taken, the difficult problems we have faced with BSE may well occur in other countries. Surely it is short-sighted for us to risk being seen in future as having been responsible for the introduction of BSE to the food chain in other countries.' Previously in 1998 Gummer, who was a MAFF Minister at the time, is reported in departmental minutes as having said the UK had a 'moral obligation to ensure that importing countries were aware we did not permit the feeding of these products to ruminants.' But MacGregor disagreed. MAFF civil servant Alistair Cruickshank told the enquiry: 'At the meeting of 14 April 1988 MacGregor gave no indication that he agreed with Gummer's suggestion.' In February 1990, Dr Hilary Pickles, a senior official in the Department of Health, wrote to the Chief Medical Officer claiming the Government's behaviour was not 'responsible'. She wrote: 'I fail to understand why this cannot be tackled from the British end.' Government scientists claim they published scientific papers about the risks of BSE which should have warned countries of the risk of feeding MBM to cattle and raised the issue at the Office Internationale des Epizooties - the international organisation concerned with animal health. Lord Phillips' report does not criticise individuals and concludes that very few BSE cases have been reported outside Europe in cattle which have been fed on British animal feed. However, a spokesman for the OIE said: 'If MBM was exported to countries in the Middle East and Africa and was used to feed cattle then there is a risk cows will become ill. 'We only hear of BSE cases from countries that report them so we cannot say for certain that a country in Africa has not had cases because we may not have been told about them.'

      "body": "<p>With onl a bit over a week to go, Al Gore and George W. Bush are still neck and neck in the polls. This is the closest race since the Kennedy-Nixon election of 1960. But unlike that race, this one is something of a bore. Most Americans aren't very interested in who's to be the next leader of the world's most powerful nation. In 1960, most adult Americans turned out to vote. This time around, it's predicted that fewer than half will bother. The presidential election of 2000 will go down as one of the closest and most boring in American history.</p> <p>The conventional Washington explanation for this is that there aren't any large issues facing America. Peace and prosperity have lured Americans into smug torpor. So the candidates' styles, smiles, sighs, smirks and quirks have become determinative. And by these trifling criteria, it's a toss up. Just wait, the pundits assure us: When the stakes are higher, we'll have a real election again.</p> <p>This is nonsense. America is not lacking large issues - among them, the incarceration of a record-shattering two million of our citizens, the expanding use of capital punishment here, the almost one in every five of American children still living in poverty, the unprecedented gap in income and wealth, the resegregation of the our schools, and the overwhelming dominance of money in American politics.

      "bodyText": "With onl a bit over a week to go, Al Gore and George W. Bush are still neck and neck in the polls. This is the closest race since the Kennedy-Nixon election of 1960. But unlike that race, this one is something of a bore. Most Americans aren't very interested in who's to be the next leader of the world's most powerful nation. In 1960, most adult Americans turned out to vote. This time around, it's predicted that fewer than half will bother. The presidential election of 2000 will go down as one of the closest and most boring in American history. The conventional Washington explanation for this is that there aren't any large issues facing America. Peace and prosperity have lured Americans into smug torpor. So the candidates' styles, smiles, sighs, smirks and quirks have become determinative. And by these trifling criteria, it's a toss up. Just wait, the pundits assure us: When the stakes are higher, we'll have a real election again. This is nonsense. America is not lacking large issues - among them, the incarceration of a record-shattering two million of our citizens, the expanding use of capital punishment here, the almost one in every five of American children still living in poverty, the unprecedented gap in income and wealth, the resegregation of the our schools, and the overwhelming dominance of money in American politics. There have been no large issues in this presidential campaign because the two major candidates and their handlers have avoided them. The closeness and dullness of this election is a consequence the strategies pursued by both sides. And it presages future American presidential elections that will be just as close and dull. From the start of the Bush and the Gore campaigns, both launched more than two years ago, the objective was clear: 'Forty percent are with us, 40 against, so we need to keep our base and take as much of the middle 20 as possible,' one consultant explained to me with the antiseptic certainty of an eye surgeon wielding a laser machine.

Sabra and Shatila, the sites of the September 1982 massacre where Christian Phalangistes killed nearly 1,700 Muslims, are nearby. 'Remember the dead of Sabra and Shatila' reads a sign over the Jilkas restaurant.</p> <p>In a grubby building off Sheikh Rageb Hareb road, Hezbollah has its national headquarters. The building betrays little indications of the feared organisation - save for a few framed photographs of the late Ayatollah Khomenei of Iran; the organisation's spiritual leader. Met at the front desk, naturally, by a male secretary, I am told to wait in a room at the other end of the floor.</p> <p>The waiting-room door opens and a Hezbollah guard stands in the doorway. He is clad simply in a work-shirt and jeans and holds a walkie-talkie. He asks for my bag. 'I will keep everything until your interview is finished,' he says, leaving me only a notepad and pen. The bag - with my passport, loose cash and plane ticket - vanishes.</p> <p>The journey to Hezbollah headquarters is timed to military perfection - an interpreter, a photographer and myself are hustled downstairs into a car park. Behind a curtained wall, a black Mercedes idly ticks over. The doors are pulled open and we are guided into the rear seats. A driver and the security guard from upstairs take their place at the front.</p> <p>The drive - little more than 10 minutes - is conducted at a riotous pace. Traffic seemingly dissolves as the Mercedes wheezes through Haret Hrek. The windows - tinted so as to obstruct a view from inside - are locked. And a curtain separates us from our hosts. But the car slows to a halt, sliding into another garage. The security guard opens the doors and we are led into an adjacent building.</p> <p>Hezbollah has always prided itself on meticulously planning its journey through Beirut. 'Journalists were once required to wear hoods,' recalls Ranwa Yehia, a reporter with the local English-speaking newspaper, The Daily Star.

      "bodyText": "Haret Hrek - a Palestinian suburb on the western margins of Beirut - is a scalding mixture of slum housing, garages and restaurants. Sabra and Shatila, the sites of the September 1982 massacre where Christian Phalangistes killed nearly 1,700 Muslims, are nearby. 'Remember the dead of Sabra and Shatila' reads a sign over the Jilkas restaurant. In a grubby building off Sheikh Rageb Hareb road, Hezbollah has its national headquarters. The building betrays little indications of the feared organisation - save for a few framed photographs of the late Ayatollah Khomenei of Iran; the organisation's spiritual leader. Met at the front desk, naturally, by a male secretary, I am told to wait in a room at the other end of the floor. The waiting-room door opens and a Hezbollah guard stands in the doorway. He is clad simply in a work-shirt and jeans and holds a walkie-talkie. He asks for my bag. 'I will keep everything until your interview is finished,' he says, leaving me only a notepad and pen. The bag - with my passport, loose cash and plane ticket - vanishes. The journey to Hezbollah headquarters is timed to military perfection - an interpreter, a photographer and myself are hustled downstairs into a car park. Behind a curtained wall, a black Mercedes idly ticks over. The doors are pulled open and we are guided into the rear seats. A driver and the security guard from upstairs take their place at the front. The drive - little more than 10 minutes - is conducted at a riotous pace. Traffic seemingly dissolves as the Mercedes wheezes through Haret Hrek. The windows - tinted so as to obstruct a view from inside - are locked. And a curtain separates us from our hosts. But the car slows to a halt, sliding into another garage. The security guard opens the doors and we are led into an adjacent building. Hezbollah has always prided itself on meticulously planning its journey through Beirut. 'Journalists were once required to wear hoods,' recalls Ranwa Yehia, a reporter with the local English-speaking newspaper, The Daily Star. 'And even nowadays, when they occasionally call press conferences, we are taken in vans in groups.' A day earlier, Hezbollah's press spokesperson Hussain had told me: 'You can understand our fears. It's not Israeli snipers we are scared of; they can just as easily bomb the building.' After a brief wait in another meeting room, we are ushered down a corridor. Sheikh Naim Qassem, Hezbollah's Deputy Secretary-General, sits in an austere meeting room. He rises from his seat and exchanges a comfortable handshake. Short, bearded, with light slivers of grey running through his beard, Qassem is dressed in the simple manner of religious clerics - a black shawl drapes his shoulders, ending at his feet. Perhaps out of Islamic modesty, he stares at the floor. A security guard attaches a microphone to his shawl and fastens it to a tape-recorder. The revolutionary diatribe is quickly unleashed. 'What has happened during the recent events of intifada has created a gap that is impossible to fill. The situation is heading in a negative direction. It has been made clear now that trying to oust people from their land is unacceptable. A Palestinian homeland is unavoidable. And it will be realised.' Qassem looks at me, matter of factly. 'Both Barak and Sharon need each other. Barak is at his weakest - and Sharon has ambitions to get back into the government. Each of the two parties has its own aims. The result of this alliance will be more dangerous. And it is proof that the Israeli mentality cannot survive for much longer.'

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>George W Bush said it himself: 'There must be no mistakes - I'm going to run hard all the way to the finish line. I never take anything for granted.'</p> <p>Just as well - for his opponent Al Gore no doubt feels the same. The only certain thing about America's election in 10 days' time is that only a fool would call it.</p> <p>As Bush seemed to be stealing ahead by a nose, latest opinion polls put the candidates back on a razor's edge at 46 per cent apiece. It is the closest fought race since John F Kennedy beat Richard Nixon in 1960.</p> <p>That battle for the undecided votes at the political centre is reaching new levels of bitterness, with proliferating dirty tricks ranging from automated phone calls attacking Bush to inflammatory TV commericals suggesting Gore's Democrats are 'soft on China'.</p> <p>Both candidates, aware that the US public dislikes personalised politics, are trying to distance themselves from the increasingly vicious undercurrents. For example, thousands of phone calls to voters in Michigan carry recorded messages of women telling tales of death, illness and social neglect in Governor Bush's Texas.</p> <p>But there was also a storm of criticism of the commercial which questions Gore's resolution on defence. Based on the notorious 'daisy' spot the Democrats ran against Barry Goldwater in 1964, the commercial, being shown in swing states like Florida, Missouri and Ohio, shows a girl counting the petals on a flower and then switches to a missile countdown. The message is that the US is now vulnerable to nuclear attack from China.</p> <p>The reason for the high-octane virulence is not just that the election is close. Rather, Bush and Gore are fighting the most politically polarised election for decades, with radically different visions for America. The result will have a more lasting effect on the country and its relationship with the rest of the world than any since Ronald Reagan's time, maybe even since Kennedy's.</p> <p>Endorsing Gore last week, the New Republic magazine called it 'one of the defining ideological moments of the post-Cold War era'.</p> <p>As the two main candidates paint aggressively negative stereotypes of each other, two themes emerge: first, public distaste for negative politics, and second, the fact that the stereotypes are often accurate. Bush's demeanour, giving the impression of moderation, conceals an ideology that would eradicate the cultural - let alone political - values and legacy of the Clinton presidency, at home and abroad. Bush offers a domestic programme which, the international dimension of the Cold War apart, is brazenly to the 'right' of Reagan's. Internationally, Bush is an isolationist - in stark contrast to the man he aims to succeed.</p> <p>Gore, in turn, while making some concessions to Clinton's 'Third Way', has taken a step to the left of his mentor with a spending programme that more resembles Truman's or even Roosevelt's. Like Clinton, Gore is a passionate internationalist, and certainly the man Europe's leaders would want to see across the table.</p> <p>Talking to The Observer last week, Scott Reed, campaign manager for Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole four years ago, says: 'Time is the only commodity you cannot buy in the last two weeks of the election campaign.'</p> <p>Bush and the Republicans (who have an almost unlimited supply of money) seek, with considerable help from the Greens' Ralph Nader, to force Gore to travel in states he had assumed were his.</p> <p>Principal among these - and most alarmingly for Gore - is California, where Bush is closing his rival's 12-point lead and where Nader commands support among alternative lifestylers. Bush has his own Achilles heel in Florida, which should by rights be his (his brother is state governor), but where Gore is stealing a march among the crucial retiree vote. Gore cannot win without California, and Bush would find it hard without Florida. Otherwise, the battlegrounds are in the Midwest: Michigan, Ohio, Missouri and Pennsylvania.</p> <p>Those are the mathematics; the politics are less straightforward. At the core of the election is the fact, announced last week, that the United States is basking in the third consecutive year of a vast budget surplus - $237bn - the first time this has happened since the days of Truman. And the surplus is predicted to run to $4.6 trillion over the next decade.</p> <p>Bush's programme is a brazen one with a kernel of tax cuts, designed to cut back the growth of government and stimulate savings and investment. According to the group Citizens for Tax Justice, 43 per cent of his cuts, costing $1.3 trillion, would go to the top 1 per cent of earners, those making more than $319,000 a year. The bulk of the rest goes to the top tenth of earners.</p> <p>Few people making more than $100,000, however, would benefit from Gore's cuts, which cost $575bn and are aimed at middle- and low-income earners - part of an ambitious plan to raise their fortunes with new spending programmes and social entitlements.</p> <p>Bush assigns $48bn for education - less than half Gore's figure - and the two clash head-on over federal subsidy vouchers for parents wishing to opt out of the public education sector.</p> <p>Over Social Security and Medicare, Bush plans to create voluntary individual retirement accounts invested in the stock market, while Gore wants to leave the pension system unchanged and use the Social Security surplus to pay off the national debt and open a 'rainy day' fund for when the baby-boom generation retires.</p> <p>Gore wants to expand the government's contribution to the appalling Medicare system (albeit nothing as radical as the failed Clinton plan of 1993), while Bush aims to overhaul the system in the opposite direction, by making it compete with an enhanced private sector.</p> <p>There has been a lot of vitriol about 'fuzzy math' as Bush and Gore bark at each other over these plans, but looming over the shoulder of both candidates is the awesome prospect that the fuzziest math of all is that on which all their presumptions are made - that the surplus projections, generated by a Wall Street boom which could deflate, may be horribly exaggerated; that America's economic miracle is walking a high wire and neither will, in the event, be able to deliver.</p> <p>With a poll in Friday's Washington Post showing 64 per cent of Americans feeling they are 'winning' with the boom, few people heed the whisper of the Congressional Budget Office, which made the $4.6 trillion estimate but cautioned: 'Substantial deviation can result from incorrect technical and economic assumptions, not to mention the effect of future legislative action' - meaning, don't necessarily take our word for it.</p> <p>The CBO warns that, even under the most optimistic scenario, the cost of providing what is promised to the retired baby-boom generation will 'ultimately overwhelm the federal budget'. If the CBO has underestimated growth by 0.5 per cent, the Treasury would be $250bn short by 2010. Many voters remain undecided, and a thick fog hangs over the exchanges of 'math' and 'counter-math'.</p> <p>But the politics must share stage space with the 'beauty contest'. It is as though the US were a teenager on a date, trying to figure out which of two boys (both trying too hard) is the cutest; choosing between Bush's fluffier hair and Gore's muscles.</p> <p>Those watching on the sidelines regard the iconography of this election as between a 'moron' and a 'robot' (The New York Observer ). Gore spent the past week trying to vamp up recollections of wild college days riding motorbikes and wearing leather, while Bush has been at pains to sweep his frat-brat encounters with booze and cocaine under the carpet.</p> <p>Bush is a son and heir who never had to justify what he was saying. He has given the world 'Bushisms' even before the voting begins - saying 'hostile' when he means 'hostage', 'gracious' for 'grateful' - and to make a virtue of his own cumbersome lexicon: 'I've been known to mangle a syllable or two, if y'all know what I mean.'</p> <p>Gore has to be both lovable and lethal and cannot seem to get it right, between the nerdish desire to make sure his audience knows he knows everything - and the various other personalities and genetic modifications that his family and his spin-doctors have designed for him.</p> <p>Finally, there is the Clinton problem. Gore has claimed the mantle of Clinton's policies while keeping as great a distance as possible from the man he served.</p> <p>This week Clinton is going back on the road in Arkansas - campaigning for the deputy who will not share a stage with him. On that decision, Gore's fate may turn.</p> <p><b>Poles apart in policy and pitch</b></p> <p><b> Tax</b><br></p> <p><b> Bush</b>: Top 1 per cent of earners would benefit from nearly half his $1.37 trillion tax cuts.</p> <p><b> Gore</b>: Tax cuts worth $575bn with better credits for couples and carers.</p> <p><b> Social security</b><br></p> <p><b> Bush</b>: Voluntary retirement plan would invest 15 per cent of payroll taxes in stocks, with cut in guaranteed benefits.</p> <p><b> Gore</b>: Sweeteners for poorer women and workers, but would use social security surplus to pay off the national debt and create reserve fund for 'baby boom' cohort when it retires.</p> <p><b> Health care</b><br></p> <p><b> Bush</b>: Tax credits to buy health insurance, and new money for prescriptions.

      "bodyText": "George W Bush said it himself: 'There must be no mistakes - I'm going to run hard all the way to the finish line. I never take anything for granted.' Just as well - for his opponent Al Gore no doubt feels the same. The only certain thing about America's election in 10 days' time is that only a fool would call it. As Bush seemed to be stealing ahead by a nose, latest opinion polls put the candidates back on a razor's edge at 46 per cent apiece. It is the closest fought race since John F Kennedy beat Richard Nixon in 1960. That battle for the undecided votes at the political centre is reaching new levels of bitterness, with proliferating dirty tricks ranging from automated phone calls attacking Bush to inflammatory TV commericals suggesting Gore's Democrats are 'soft on China'. Both candidates, aware that the US public dislikes personalised politics, are trying to distance themselves from the increasingly vicious undercurrents. For example, thousands of phone calls to voters in Michigan carry recorded messages of women telling tales of death, illness and social neglect in Governor Bush's Texas. But there was also a storm of criticism of the commercial which questions Gore's resolution on defence. Based on the notorious 'daisy' spot the Democrats ran against Barry Goldwater in 1964, the commercial, being shown in swing states like Florida, Missouri and Ohio, shows a girl counting the petals on a flower and then switches to a missile countdown. The message is that the US is now vulnerable to nuclear attack from China. The reason for the high-octane virulence is not just that the election is close. Rather, Bush and Gore are fighting the most politically polarised election for decades, with radically different visions for America. The result will have a more lasting effect on the country and its relationship with the rest of the world than any since Ronald Reagan's time, maybe even since Kennedy's. Endorsing Gore last week, the New Republic magazine called it 'one of the defining ideological moments of the post-Cold War era'. As the two main candidates paint aggressively negative stereotypes of each other, two themes emerge: first, public distaste for negative politics, and second, the fact that the stereotypes are often accurate. Bush's demeanour, giving the impression of moderation, conceals an ideology that would eradicate the cultural - let alone political - values and legacy of the Clinton presidency, at home and abroad. Bush offers a domestic programme which, the international dimension of the Cold War apart, is brazenly to the 'right' of Reagan's. Internationally, Bush is an isolationist - in stark contrast to the man he aims to succeed. Gore, in turn, while making some concessions to Clinton's 'Third Way', has taken a step to the left of his mentor with a spending programme that more resembles Truman's or even Roosevelt's. Like Clinton, Gore is a passionate internationalist, and certainly the man Europe's leaders would want to see across the table. Talking to The Observer last week, Scott Reed, campaign manager for Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole four years ago, says: 'Time is the only commodity you cannot buy in the last two weeks of the election campaign.' Bush and the Republicans (who have an almost unlimited supply of money) seek, with considerable help from the Greens' Ralph Nader, to force Gore to travel in states he had assumed were his. Principal among these - and most alarmingly for Gore - is California, where Bush is closing his rival's 12-point lead and where Nader commands support among alternative lifestylers. Bush has his own Achilles heel in Florida, which should by rights be his (his brother is state governor), but where Gore is stealing a march among the crucial retiree vote. Gore cannot win without California, and Bush would find it hard without Florida. Otherwise, the battlegrounds are in the Midwest: Michigan, Ohio, Missouri and Pennsylvania. Those are the mathematics; the politics are less straightforward. At the core of the election is the fact, announced last week, that the United States is basking in the third consecutive year of a vast budget surplus - $237bn - the first time this has happened since the days of Truman. And the surplus is predicted to run to $4.6 trillion over the next decade. Bush's programme is a brazen one with a kernel of tax cuts, designed to cut back the growth of government and stimulate savings and investment. According to the group Citizens for Tax Justice, 43 per cent of his cuts, costing $1.3 trillion, would go to the top 1 per cent of earners, those making more than $319,000 a year. The bulk of the rest goes to the top tenth of earners. Few people making more than $100,000, however, would benefit from Gore's cuts, which cost $575bn and are aimed at middle- and low-income earners - part of an ambitious plan to raise their fortunes with new spending programmes and social entitlements. Bush assigns $48bn for education - less than half Gore's figure - and the two clash head-on over federal subsidy vouchers for parents wishing to opt out of the public education sector. Over Social Security and Medicare, Bush plans to create voluntary individual retirement accounts invested in the stock market, while Gore wants to leave the pension system unchanged and use the Social Security surplus to pay off the national debt and open a 'rainy day' fund for when the baby-boom generation retires. Gore wants to expand the government's contribution to the appalling Medicare system (albeit nothing as radical as the failed Clinton plan of 1993), while Bush aims to overhaul the system in the opposite direction, by making it compete with an enhanced private sector. There has been a lot of vitriol about 'fuzzy math' as Bush and Gore bark at each other over these plans, but looming over the shoulder of both candidates is the awesome prospect that the fuzziest math of all is that on which all their presumptions are made - that the surplus projections, generated by a Wall Street boom which could deflate, may be horribly exaggerated; that America's economic miracle is walking a high wire and neither will, in the event, be able to deliver. With a poll in Friday's Washington Post showing 64 per cent of Americans feeling they are 'winning' with the boom, few people heed the whisper of the Congressional Budget Office, which made the $4.6 trillion estimate but cautioned: 'Substantial deviation can result from incorrect technical and economic assumptions, not to mention the effect of future legislative action' - meaning, don't necessarily take our word for it. The CBO warns that, even under the most optimistic scenario, the cost of providing what is promised to the retired baby-boom generation will 'ultimately overwhelm the federal budget'. If the CBO has underestimated growth by 0.5 per cent, the Treasury would be $250bn short by 2010. Many voters remain undecided, and a thick fog hangs over the exchanges of 'math' and 'counter-math'. But the politics must share stage space with the 'beauty contest'. It is as though the US were a teenager on a date, trying to figure out which of two boys (both trying too hard) is the cutest; choosing between Bush's fluffier hair and Gore's muscles. Those watching on the sidelines regard the iconography of this election as between a 'moron' and a 'robot' (The New York Observer ). Gore spent the past week trying to vamp up recollections of wild college days riding motorbikes and wearing leather, while Bush has been at pains to sweep his frat-brat encounters with booze and cocaine under the carpet. Bush is a son and heir who never had to justify what he was saying. He has given the world 'Bushisms' even before the voting begins - saying 'hostile' when he means 'hostage', 'gracious' for 'grateful' - and to make a virtue of his own cumbersome lexicon: 'I've been known to mangle a syllable or two, if y'all know what I mean.' Gore has to be both lovable and lethal and cannot seem to get it right, between the nerdish desire to make sure his audience knows he knows everything - and the various other personalities and genetic modifications that his family and his spin-doctors have designed for him. Finally, there is the Clinton problem. Gore has claimed the mantle of Clinton's policies while keeping as great a distance as possible from the man he served. This week Clinton is going back on the road in Arkansas - campaigning for the deputy who will not share a stage with him. On that decision, Gore's fate may turn. Poles apart in policy and pitch Tax Bush: Top 1 per cent of earners would benefit from nearly half his $1.37 trillion tax cuts. Gore: Tax cuts worth $575bn with better credits for couples and carers. Social security Bush: Voluntary retirement plan would invest 15 per cent of payroll taxes in stocks, with cut in guaranteed benefits. Gore: Sweeteners for poorer women and workers, but would use social security surplus to pay off the national debt and create reserve fund for 'baby boom' cohort when it retires. Health care Bush: Tax credits to buy health insurance, and new money for prescriptions. A 'patients' rights' charter . Gore: Would insure every child with tax credits for other uninsured. Assured federal Medicare coverage. Education Bush: $48bn for teacher recruitment and training. Vouchers to send children to private schools and $300 million in loans for privately managed 'charter schools' in deprived areas. Gore: $170bn for teachers' pay and hire 100,000 more; $1.8bn to triple charter schools. Guns Bush: Opposes new gun control laws, but supports ban on concealed and assault weapons. Gore: Wants registration of new guns and ID licensing, ban on 'junk' guns, compulsory child locks on weapons.

      "body": "<p>'We saved them a lot of embarrassment,' was the taciturn verdict of Tommy Helsby, senior executive with corporate security firm Kroll Associates. Embarrassment and probably a lot of money. Helsby was referring to one of his clients, a US internet giant, which was recently poised to launch in the UK. What the US dotcom didn't realise was that the head of the company it had chosen as its UK partner had been convicted of peddling indecent material. </p> <p>Maybe this was something that would not have worried the US firm's investors had they known. But the fact that the company had been kept in the dark by a potential business partner set the alarm bells ringing; the deal was pulled. </p> <p>With internet companies rushing to enter new markets as part of a frantic land grab, online firms are ignoring lengthy auditing procedures - designed to check the quality of their investors, business partners or staff - in a bid to beat the pack. This highlights the extremely fragile, get-rich-quick nature of the dotcom sector. </p> <p>Typically, Kroll would expect to find problems in 10 per cent of the people it ran background checks on - but last week the company sent shockwaves through the dotcom sector when it published a survey showing that senior executives at internet companies are four times more likely to have what Kroll diplomatically describes as 'unsavoury backgrounds'. To put it another way, of the 70 'due diligence' background investigations performed on key internet personnel by Kroll between April and September this year, 39 per cent of the subjects had been involved in illegal activities such as stock market violations, undisclosed bankruptcy and insurance fraud. These are all issues that would have raised huge corporate governance concerns and sent investors fleeing. </p> <p>Often those checked by Kroll were the senior personnel drafted in by the young, relatively naive, founders of dotcom firms looking to add experience to the board in a bid to attract further funding. Venture capital firms are usually wary of injecting cash until the management board has been beefed up with executives who have experience of running companies, not just starting them. </p> <p>But with background checks taking an average of six weeks to complete, some dotcom firms find they haven't the time to examine their new executives' credentials. </p> <p>Many in the dotcom sector expressed little surprise. 'We've looked at loads of dotcom companies, and in many cases it's always been quite clear that the management was never up to scratch,' said a spokesman for one US bank that invests in internet firms. </p> <p>An analyst with an internet research firm agreed: 'Given the huge amount of hype, it's not surprising that the sector would end up attracting some of the less credible types.' </p> <p>But it is not just the managements of some start-ups who represent the Wild West spirit of the darkest corners of the world wide web. Some of those seeking to back the firms have dubious backgrounds as well. 'We've had cases where people have come to us because they've been approached by mysterious people, usually based in an offshore tax shelter, who wish to invest big amounts of money,' Helsby said. 'These people would say \"we don't want to invest the $2 million you're asking for. We want to invest $5 million\".' </p> <p>He offers three possible responses for any dotcom company that finds itself in this situation. One: The people involved are unbelievably stupid, so don't deal with them. Two: They are money launderers, so don't deal with them. Three: They are scam artists looking to control the business in order to take it public and pump it out to gullible investors. </p> <p>This so-called 'pump and dump' habit is now increasingly common on the web. Investors pile into a company (usually penny stocks so that there is little liquidity, allowing for much greater price volatility), hype it in internet chat rooms, wait for the stock to soar and then sell at the peak. </p> <p>These types of schemes have been around for years but the emergence of the internet means they are now much easier to pull off. As Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said recently: 'The internet, with its low-cost anonymity and large number of innocent investors, makes it ripe for out-and-out fraud.' </p> <p>First, the hype around the actual internet stocks themselves has made investors more gullible and thus more hungry to take part in such schemes. Second, the internet as a medium has made it easier for more investors to get sucked into the mania, no matter where they are based. </p> <p>The most famous example so far came earlier this year when Eulex Corp, the giant US networking equipment maker, saw more than $2.5 billion wiped off its market capitalisation in only a few hours after a fake press release, sent to various newswires, claimed it was having to adjust its earnings and was consequently being investigated by the SEC. Investors dumped the stock, allowing those who had posted the warning to sell short and make a killing. </p> <p>As if to illustrate just how easy such schemes are to perpetrate (if not to get away with) last month 15-year-old Jonathan Lebed was forced to pay $285,000 to avoid prosecution by the SEC, which alleged he bought large numbers of shares and then proceeded to flood internet chat rooms, suggesting the stock was 'the most undervalued ever'. </p> <p>The number of such schemes is growing fast. Since 1995 the SEC has been involved in nearly 200 actions similar to the one it took against Lebed. More than a third of these have taken place over the past year. </p> <p>Worryingly, organised crime is now showing an interest. In June 104 people with suspected Mob links were arrested in the US following the largest securities fraud crackdown in the country's history. Those arrested dealt largely in small cap firms - the sorts of businesses that are usually ignored by Wall Street. It is alleged that those involved in the scam, including representatives of the notorious Bonanno crime family, the Mafia's largest drug dealers, developed a network of internet newsletters and chat rooms to promote the stocks they held. </p> <p>Helsby said: 'People think that these internet stock scams are done by 'boiler room' operators, the sharp city slickers, but very often they are linked to organised crime. </p> <p>'Typically a company set up in one country will sell securities issued in a second country to investors in a third. So the problem is who regulates? US and Canadian criminals are experts at this, but the Russian mafia is catching on fast.' </p> <p>Faster than the regulatory authorities anyway. Despite the growing concerns about the financing, management and fiduciary responsibilities of dotcom firms, policing the sector is still in its infancy. </p> <p>Not until next year will it become a civil offence for UK investors to initiate pump and dump schemes. Currently the authorities only have the power to initiate criminal proceedings, something they are reluctant to do because of time and cost constraints. It is symptomatic of the fact that, as more and more companies move at internet speed, the sheriffs of the wild, wild web find themselves outgunned.</p>",

First, the hype around the actual internet stocks themselves has made investors more gullible and thus more hungry to take part in such schemes. Second, the internet as a medium has made it easier for more investors to get sucked into the mania, no matter where they are based. The most famous example so far came earlier this year when Eulex Corp, the giant US networking equipment maker, saw more than $2.5 billion wiped off its market capitalisation in only a few hours after a fake press release, sent to various newswires, claimed it was having to adjust its earnings and was consequently being investigated by the SEC. Investors dumped the stock, allowing those who had posted the warning to sell short and make a killing. As if to illustrate just how easy such schemes are to perpetrate (if not to get away with) last month 15-year-old Jonathan Lebed was forced to pay $285,000 to avoid prosecution by the SEC, which alleged he bought large numbers of shares and then proceeded to flood internet chat rooms, suggesting the stock was 'the most undervalued ever'. The number of such schemes is growing fast. Since 1995 the SEC has been involved in nearly 200 actions similar to the one it took against Lebed. More than a third of these have taken place over the past year. Worryingly, organised crime is now showing an interest. In June 104 people with suspected Mob links were arrested in the US following the largest securities fraud crackdown in the country's history. Those arrested dealt largely in small cap firms - the sorts of businesses that are usually ignored by Wall Street. It is alleged that those involved in the scam, including representatives of the notorious Bonanno crime family, the Mafia's largest drug dealers, developed a network of internet newsletters and chat rooms to promote the stocks they held. Helsby said: 'People think that these internet stock scams are done by 'boiler room' operators, the sharp city slickers, but very often they are linked to organised crime. 'Typically a company set up in one country will sell securities issued in a second country to investors in a third. So the problem is who regulates? US and Canadian criminals are experts at this, but the Russian mafia is catching on fast.' Faster than the regulatory authorities anyway. Despite the growing concerns about the financing, management and fiduciary responsibilities of dotcom firms, policing the sector is still in its infancy. Not until next year will it become a civil offence for UK investors to initiate pump and dump schemes. Currently the authorities only have the power to initiate criminal proceedings, something they are reluctant to do because of time and cost constraints. It is symptomatic of the fact that, as more and more companies move at internet speed, the sheriffs of the wild, wild web find themselves outgunned.",

      "bodyText": "Former Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith returns a week tomorrow to his home in Zimbabwe. He says he relishes the prospect of facing charges of genocide threatened by President Robert Mugabe, whose hold on power is under threat. But at Oxford last week, in the civilised ambience of a Union debate, Smith found himself on trial for having failed to learn the lessons of history. Smith said he refused to apologise for atrocities committed while he held office. He said he had no regrets about the estimated 30,000 Zimbabweans killed during his rule. 'The more we killed, the happier we were. We were fighting terrorists.' Smith brushed off last week's threat by Mugabe to put him on trial for 'genocide and atrocities' committed durning the war of liberation in the Seventies. He told The Observer: 'I'm happy about it. I'd come to him, because I've got nothing to apologise for. He's the only one who should be concerned about violations of human rights.' Smith, who ruled Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, for 15 years, and once ran on a ticket for a 'whiter, brighter Rhodesia', proposed the motion: 'African leaders put power before their people.' A skeletal 81-year-old, he used his slot on the debating floor to deliver a lecture criticised as having less to do with the debate than being a 'history lesson' - denouncing Mugabe as a dictator while looking back on his regime with rose-tinted glasses. When members of the audience asked Smith to explain the differences between his regime and Mugabe's administration, a furious Smith defended his actions. 'We were fighting a war. They were killing innocent people. They were killing their own people. They were massacring innocent people. We never killed civilians.' Throughout the course of his speech, Smith spoke of the people he used to govern in less than endearing terms, at some points calling them rapists and murderers. 'As the former Prime Minister of Rhodesia, isn't this an opportune time to ask for forgiveness?' interrupted Mrs Pavelyn Tendai Musaka, Zimbabwe's Deputy High Commissioner in Britain. Smith didn't think so. 'We had no atrocities. We killed terrorists... The Shona, they massacred 30,000 Matabele because the Matabele were beginning to stand their ground.' Professor Welshman Ncube, shadow Home Affairs Minister for the Movement for Democratic Change, was also in Oxford for the debate. He does not see things in the same light as Ian Smith. 'The war Smith fought was definitely not a just war. It was a war to preserve a racist regime, it was a war to retard democratic development in the country, and to think that he could actually today stand up and feel no remorse, no contrition, find nothing wrong in the system he defended, is in itself astounding. In fact, perhaps he needs forgiveness himself.' Zimbabweans, whether Mugabe or MDC supporters, view him as a racist relic of an old Africa that has had its day. 'The world has moved a long way from the primitive racial things they stood for and caused a lot of death for,' said Ncube. 'So, it's sad to stand back and hear him completely oblivious of the wrong things his government tried to do. But that's the reality. But now, instead of being bogged down in that, we're saying that Zimbabwe faces new challenges today. Smith and his group are history.'",

'Don't worry,' says my wife. 'They've probably got a cafe.' </p> <p>So off we go in the car, me with my finger sticking out like a sore thumb, while my wife tries to calm the children, who are still in deep shock at the prospect of having to do history on their day off. 'It'll be really good,' she says.

We move on to the officers' mess, where a selection of upright chaps are discussing Jerry's movements over badger rissoles. 'Ah, hullo!' roars someone with a big moustache as though we are boffins from divisional HQ on a surprise visit. We smile weakly and make our escape before we are invited to pronounce upon the latest developments in doodlebug technology, only to stumble upon a Mrs Mop-type having a rest in the corridor.

It plans to raise the levels at which savings are disregarded for calculating means-tested benefits, but this will be of limited help. Tomorrow's pensioners, struggling with a complex means-tested system may, with hindsight, feel that a large tax increase would have been money well spent. \u0095 The Consumers' Association goes to court tomorrow to seek an award of costs to fund a legal challenge against insurance giant Axa. The CA wants the firm to change the way it plans to distribute its surplus funds, or orphan assets. An actuary hired by CA has concluded he does not have enough information to judge fully whether the deal is fair or not. What hope is there, then, for ordinary policyholders?",

He has devoted 20 years to his life of John Maynard Keynes and, with this, the third volume of a biography of Proustian proportions, he has demonstrated that the whole enterprise was worth every ounce of the struggle. </p> <p>The first volume, Hopes Betrayed, took us to 1920, and Keynes's The Economic Consequences of the Peace, whose concerns about the inadequacies of the Treaty of Versailles proved all too well founded. The Economic Consequences made Keynes world-famous even before the launch of Keynesian economics. And, as Skidelsky wrote at the end of volume one: 'In 1925, the world-famous economist would marry a world-famous ballerina in a blaze of publicity.' </p> <p> Hopes Betrayed was published in 1983, a time when the monetarist and extreme laissez-faire doctrines then prevailing indicated that the Keynesian legacy had been betrayed. The next volume - The Economist As Saviour 1920 - 1937 - came out in 1992 and had to compete with Maynard Keynes - An Economist's Biography by D.E. Moggridge, a distinguished professor of economics. </p> <p>Problematically, Moggridge took the story right up to the death of Keynes in 1946, whereas Skidelsky, necessarily but irritatingly, stopped a long way short. Nevertheless, there was a lot of good stuff in volume two, and what especially captured the imagination was the genuine love story between Keynes and that world-famous ballerina, the Russian Lydia Lopokova. </p> <p>The great thing about this third book is that Skidelsky has drawn on Roy Harrod (the first notable Keynes biographer), Moggridge and a veritable treasure trove of official and unofficial documents, not least the archives of the Keynes family and his college, King's, Cambridge. Harrod, who had worked with - and sometimes against - Keynes knew he was, in a sense, contributing to a later biography such as Skidelsky's when he wrote that, if he had made mistakes, 'through lack of sufficient perspective, these can be corrected by future students. My task has been to save them from mistakes, which there would later be no one to correct'. </p> <p>Skidelsky explained the background to Keynes's General Theory in volume two. As he wrote then, the trouble with the classical economists was that they 'lacked a theory of effective demand. The fatal flaw in the system he [Keynes] pointed out lay in the variability of spending relative to earnings... the result was that the market system was liable to collapse into prolonged depression'. But Keynes's purpose was always to make the market system work, not to replace it by communism or socialism. He was both a Liberal and a liberal, with a strong sense of community, and of the need for the government to fill crucial gaps. As Skidelsky says: 'His ideal was a mix of private and public patronage.' </p> <p>As Skidelsky shows us in this final volume, Keynes may have been a genius, but he was also a member of the human race, absorbed as much by the detailed management of his small Sussex farm as by high finance, serious economics and the arts. He was also battling against illness for much of this period, whether as 'entrepreneur' for the Keynesian Revolution or as - the major theme of the final volume - Britain's leading general in the financial war against America. </p> <p>For that is what it was. As Skidelsky puts it, while we were all fighting Germany (and the US had not yet entered the war) 'the Americans tried to use Lend-Lease as a lever to destroy Britain's pre-war financial and trading system, based on the sterling area and imperial preference'. From early on, Keynes, effectively Britain's chief negotiator with the Americans over paying for the war and preparing the postwar settlement, had as a goal 'the retention by us of enough assets to leave us capable of independent action'. </p> <p>Skidelsky argues that 'America's main war aim, after the defeat of Germany and Japan, was the liquidisation of the British Empire'. One of the greatest ironies was that Harry Dexter White, the senior US Treasury official with whom Keynes did so much negotiation over the postwar economic order and the difficult US postwar loan to Britain, was effectively a Soviet agent. Skidelsky gently puts it as a 'possibility' that 'White's pro-Soviet stance led him to advocate policies designed to boost the international position of the Soviet Union at the expense of Britain and Western Europe'. </p> <p>A lot of good it did. The Soviet Union did not ratify the Bretton Woods Agreement and that was 'the real start of the Cold War'. In the end, the wartime ally to whom White passed information became the 'Evil Empire' and Western Europe needed to be rescued economically by the Marshall Plan. </p> <p>The UK was still servicing and paying off the postwar American loan in the Sixties and Seventies. However great Keynes's intellectual powers, the US owned the postwar world. As Skidelsky says, Keynes defended the terms of the loan and the shape of the Bretton Woods Agreement as 'a reasonable compromise between two great nations with the same goal: to restore a liberal world economy'. </p> <p>People tend to forget how hard Keynes had to fight to get his ideas accepted. What astonishes the modern reader is how much he managed to fit into his life, including, while all the wartime negotiations were going on, with frequent trips to Washington, the creation of what is now known as the Arts Council. </p> <p>Skidelsky may feel that Keynes's followers pushed his economics to the limit - for Keynes, 'demand management' was more about variations in public-sector investment than discretionary tax changes - but, after a brief monetarist interlude, the Keynesian view that governments can intervene successfully to stabilise the economy is back in vogue, even if they prefer to do it via central banks and interest rates. It should never be forgotten that hoarding, nationally and internationally, can damage your economic health.</p>",

There's charm here, but it's closely allied to wit and shares with it a piercing quality. Penelope Fitzgerald's swansong simply shows up reviewing as an inefficient mechanism. A 1,000-word piece like this one is easily a thirtieth as long as the compact book itself, but the best it can hope for is to avoid the basely analytical, the slackly descriptive, the excessively quoting. Only in fiction can compression still leave the air in. All of this writer's novels are miniatures, which makes it more surprising (rather than less) that a further reduction of scale should result in work so readable, and so sharply tender. </p> <p>Fitzgerald, who died this year aged 83, had a famously late start - she didn't publish her first novel until she was 60. Her earlier books methodically used material from her life (running a bookshop, say, or working for the BBC, living with her family on a Thames barge), but then her imagination started roving further afield. Her talent changed its diet.</p> <p>Four of her nine novels were short-listed for the Booker Prize - an extraordinary statistic - and one won it (Offshore in 1979). There was no such recognition in 1995 for her last novel, The Blue Flower, her delicate evocation of love in eighteenth-century Germany, though there might be said to have been a vacancy on that year's slimline, five-book short list. The book was much admired, nevertheless, and went on to win the American National Book Critics' Circle Award. </p> <p>Half the eight stories in The Means of Escape are set outside these islands, and more than half have period settings, lightly but authoritatively managed. The modern and domestic stories are, if anything, the less substantial - even if insubstantiality is part of the point of one such story with a contemporary London setting ('The Axe'), specifically the inadequacy of institutional language to accommodate reality. </p> <p>An office manager writes a memo to his boss about the actual effect of redundancy (the axe of the title, though the story has an element of horror) on a long-term employee. After a paragraph, the tone of voice modulates: 'From this point on I feel able to write more freely, it being well understood, at office-managerial level, that you do not read more than the first two sentences of any given report. You believe that anything which cannot be put into two sentences is not worth attending to, a piece of wisdom which you usually attribute to the late Lord Beaverbrook.' </p> <p>When a mobile phone rings from the depths of a great beige handbag in 'Not Shown', the detail seems less present to author or reader than the nuances of Muslim teetotalism during the late Ottoman Empire in 'The Prescription' (raki-drinking being permissible on the grounds that it had not been invented in the days of the Prophet), or the glimpses of prison life in Van Diemen's Land, before it became Tasmania, in the book's title story. </p> <p>A strong authorial persona surfaces unpredictably, one which would be actively brusque without its hint of geniality: '...a remote country place... don't picture a shack, though' (from 'At Hiruharama'); 'What brother or sister likes being asked such questions?' ('Desideratus'); 'Sound is always said to carry well over water. This didn't' ('Beehernz'); 'She belonged to the tribe of torturers. Why pretend they don't exist?' ('Not Shown').

      "bodyText": "The Means of Escape Penelope Fitzgerald Flamingo \u00a312.99, pp116 Buy it at BOL This exquisite, posthumous collection of stories isn't so unmannerly to defy reviewing nor even to disarm it. There's charm here, but it's closely allied to wit and shares with it a piercing quality. Penelope Fitzgerald's swansong simply shows up reviewing as an inefficient mechanism. A 1,000-word piece like this one is easily a thirtieth as long as the compact book itself, but the best it can hope for is to avoid the basely analytical, the slackly descriptive, the excessively quoting. Only in fiction can compression still leave the air in. All of this writer's novels are miniatures, which makes it more surprising (rather than less) that a further reduction of scale should result in work so readable, and so sharply tender. Fitzgerald, who died this year aged 83, had a famously late start - she didn't publish her first novel until she was 60. Her earlier books methodically used material from her life (running a bookshop, say, or working for the BBC, living with her family on a Thames barge), but then her imagination started roving further afield. Her talent changed its diet. Four of her nine novels were short-listed for the Booker Prize - an extraordinary statistic - and one won it (Offshore in 1979). There was no such recognition in 1995 for her last novel, The Blue Flower, her delicate evocation of love in eighteenth-century Germany, though there might be said to have been a vacancy on that year's slimline, five-book short list. The book was much admired, nevertheless, and went on to win the American National Book Critics' Circle Award. Half the eight stories in The Means of Escape are set outside these islands, and more than half have period settings, lightly but authoritatively managed. The modern and domestic stories are, if anything, the less substantial - even if insubstantiality is part of the point of one such story with a contemporary London setting ('The Axe'), specifically the inadequacy of institutional language to accommodate reality. An office manager writes a memo to his boss about the actual effect of redundancy (the axe of the title, though the story has an element of horror) on a long-term employee. After a paragraph, the tone of voice modulates: 'From this point on I feel able to write more freely, it being well understood, at office-managerial level, that you do not read more than the first two sentences of any given report. You believe that anything which cannot be put into two sentences is not worth attending to, a piece of wisdom which you usually attribute to the late Lord Beaverbrook.' When a mobile phone rings from the depths of a great beige handbag in 'Not Shown', the detail seems less present to author or reader than the nuances of Muslim teetotalism during the late Ottoman Empire in 'The Prescription' (raki-drinking being permissible on the grounds that it had not been invented in the days of the Prophet), or the glimpses of prison life in Van Diemen's Land, before it became Tasmania, in the book's title story. A strong authorial persona surfaces unpredictably, one which would be actively brusque without its hint of geniality: '...a remote country place... don't picture a shack, though' (from 'At Hiruharama'); 'What brother or sister likes being asked such questions?' ('Desideratus'); 'Sound is always said to carry well over water. This didn't' ('Beehernz'); 'She belonged to the tribe of torturers. Why pretend they don't exist?' ('Not Shown'). It's clear that Fitzgerald enjoys an absolute authority, but prefers to see what happens when she reins it in. She has a taste for aphorisms that hark back to Jane Austen, and could occasionally be mistaken for her coinings: 'In time... sharpness might turn into nothing worse than industry, which is harmless' ('The Prescription'), for instance. Or another from the title story: 'The weight of unexpended affection which is one of a woman's greatest inconveniences.'

An ambitiously structured who- and whydunnit, narrated by a woman, Mrs Ranelagh, who, in 1978, found a neighbour dying in the rain-soaked gutter in front of her house, it succeeds magnificently at almost every level. Walters's psychological thrillers have always combined compassion and a strong social conscience with a ruthless ability to create unease, suspense and, sometimes, horror. </p> <p> The Shape of Snakes is angrily concerned with racism and our attitude to mental conditions: the dying woman, Annie Butts, is black and suffers from Tourette syndrome, whose symptoms include body jerking, talking to yourself and unwillingly spouting obscenities. Those around her, seeing only the symptoms and ignorant of the cause, nickname her 'Mad Annie'. </p> <p>Although the coroner decided Annie's death was accidental, Mrs Ranelagh has spent 20 years while living abroad trying to prove she was murdered by racist neighbours. Now back in England to confront suspects and witnesses, she reveals that most people on whom her inquiry touches, including her husband, have guilty secrets and the reader finds the chilling reasons for Mrs Ranelagh's own psychological quirks; seldom has a narrator started out more unreliable. </p> <p>Walters reconstructs Ranelagh's past investigation in the form of emails, letters, newspaper cuttings, transcripts of official reports and even, playfully, photographs, which I suspect come out of the Walters's family album circa 1978. There are perhaps a couple of particularly nasty but not-quite-convincing twists too many but otherwise this is a superb, compelling exploration of guilt and revenge. </p> <p>Walters's work has always adapted pretty well to television.

She's still unequalled at chilling us with the forensic detail of what suffering the human body can and cannot endure and nobody knows her way round a path lab better; as Val McDermid once remarked, most of Cornwell's regular readers could probably confidently perform autopsies blindfold by now. And The Last Precinct is a significant book in that it places Scarpetta squarely at a crossroads. Once it gets going - and it takes a while - it's a page-turning, bravura piece of writing. But I just don't buy it. </p> <p> The Last Precinct is billed as a sequel to Black Notice, which ended with Scarpetta narrowly surviving the attack of the werewolf Jean-Baptiste Chandonne. But it's more a reworking of that and a re-examination of other telling episodes in Scarpetta's recent past, from the death of her long-time lover, Benton, to the murder of her antagonist, Dianne Bray, as Virginia's chief medical examiner finds herself under investigation for murder. Unfortunately, Cornwell's ambitious attempt to rework those recent incidents involves plotting that in a writer first acclaimed for her realism becomes increasingly ridiculous. </p> <p>It doesn't help that even when Scarpetta is on the ropes and hounded at every turn, she still manages to come across as humourless, snobbish and holier than thou, characteristics that have been getting more pronounced with each new book. I understand that Scarpetta's impeccable taste is a deliberate counter to the gruesome requirements of her job as a forensic pathologist, but Cornwell can handle it so crassly.

There's a sense in which all mystery fiction is an exploration of the family and here McCone, who is part native American, investigates a family secret - her own family, her own secret. On the death of her father, she discovers that she is adopted. In tracing her birth parents, she goes deep into native American country and gets embroiled in a family feud and in violence past and present. Impeccably written and fast moving, this is straight down-the-line mystery writing at its best.",

I shouldn't clutter a narrative with fragments.' </p> <p>Here, in the title story, Rick Moody is apparently offering us a 'real' voice, stripped by pain of all its brilliant disguises. It is about the death of a sister, whose life he offers to us in snapshots: her childhood, her motherhood, her sudden death. 'I should have a better ending,' he says. 'I shouldn't say her life was short and often sad, I shouldn't say she had her demons, as I do too...' </p> <p>It is tempting to think of this beautiful and melancholy coda to Rick Moody's stories as the appearance of the author, stepping out of the shadows at last, particularly since the first story in the collection is also, though much more obliquely, about the death of a beloved sister.

Demonology acts as a showcase for his extraordinary virtuosity, a range that stretches from alto to deep bass. He can write as a mother and ageing actress. He can write a story that purports to be the introduction to the boxed set of one Wilkie Fahnstock, a nicely-tuned jest that edges, in the last few lines, into something else. He can write a strange, modern fairy-tale, as he does in 'Pan's Fair Throng'. He can evoke two entire lives in a few pages, or stretch a handful of minutes into a long, slow movement - going down, not out.</p> <p>He likes to play with language, mimicking and mocking academic, Latinate dryness, or the windy rhetoric of postmodern art critics. He loves to produce the voices inside the head - the voices that aren't heard normally, the private monologues that we hold back from the world. He loves conversations that are slangy and colloquial but then become sudden poetry, the ordinary made beautiful, in the same way that the deprivations of American urban life can for a few lines turn into beauty. </p> <p>He has an unerring feel for language, a delicacy of touch and effect. He is especially good at transitions - from humour to grief, mockery to sweetness. </p> <p>He can write as a dysfunctional young man, as he does in 'The Mansion on a Hill' - a man who first introduces himself to us wearing a chicken mask, which he has to put on to advertise the Hot Bird Caf\u00e9 (Bucket of Drumsticks $2.99), and who later winds up working for a company that arranges weddings. Romance to order, the more expensive the better; the staff lay on dreams of happiness ever after, while spying on the couples, discovering grooms kissing bridesmaids, fathers in the broom cupboard with another man's wife. </p> <p>The narrator is busy saying no to life, to dreams - his story is a monologue addressed to 'Sis'. But Sis died in a car crash; he carries her ashes around in a canister and ends by tossing them (ash rises in a cloud of grey dust; the small pieces of bones drop earthwards) upon the man she was going to marry, now happily saying 'I do' to another. The combination of pain and farce, satire and nostalgia, makes the story strange and unexpected. Subjects collide; there are things in the depths that work their way onto the surface narrative. </p> <p>In the longest story, 'Carnival Time', Moody gives us two voices: the first a woman trying to get into her own house where she is about to host the 'opening' to a fatuous new art gallery she and her uncommitted boyfriend are starting, but scared back by a couple of barking stray dogs. The second voice belongs to her absent, hopeless boyfriend. </p> <p>The story is full of the sense of missing: not only do they miss each other, they miss their lives. Happiness comes to them in retrospect. Love passes them by, like a train they don't board. They are lonely, but don't see each other. They can't say the words. They can't rise to the moment. Nothing happens the way it was meant to. They are always looking in the other direction. </p> <p>Missing is one of Moody's themes - for under all the acts of attention-seeking virtuosity in Demonology there is a kind of unifying sensibility that turns the collection from a dazzling performance into something much more enduring. </p> <p>Love is difficult, if not impossible.

Do you find that the demands of writing a thriller are at odds with your interest in these themes? </p> <p> <strong> KF: </strong> You know, I'm really much more interested in writing the thriller than in those themes. The suspense, the structuring of the novel in such a way that the reader will always be wondering what's going to happen next, is actually the centre of my interest as a writer. </p> <p> <strong> Obs: </strong> So you are not one of those genre writers who yearns to win the Booker? </p> <p> <strong> KF: </strong> No indeed, no. Trust, loyalty and betrayal are quite interesting, but I don't write books to explore those grand themes. I write books to entertain and amuse and fascinate people. If there's an issue of loyalty and betrayal in the story it's not my main concern. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> I think you want to show that behind these big public events there is a private drama. </p> <p> <strong> KF: </strong> That's because private dramas are always so much more interesting than public dramas, especially in a novel. </p> <p> <strong> Obs:</strong> You don't have any anxiety about being characterised as a genre writer? </p> <p> <strong> KF: </strong> No, no, not at all.

My normal cycle is a book every two years. The first year is planning. Part of that is research but it's quite a small part. Most of it is figuring out the structure of the plot.

So I don't really know. \u0095 Ken Follett became an international bestseller with Eye of the Needle (1978). His latest in a string of popular thrillers is Code to Zero (Macmillan \u00a316.99)",

To a person living in the mid-eighteenth century, just before the onset of romanticism, such behaviour would have been evidence only of madness. But one result of romanticism was to make madness itself seem worth affecting, given its association with child-like innocence and quasi-prophetic insight. </p> <p>Perhaps the greatest change which occurred in European culture between the French Revolution and the Battle of Waterloo was that the individual ceased to be of interest merely as an embodiment of general human characteristics, but became, instead, a conduit for new ideas about what human nature was. For, according to Anita Brookner, the old certitudes had been given a mighty knock by the social changes expressed in the French Revolution; and a widespread attitude of scepticism towards them became, for many romantic artists, as indispensable a component of artistic amour-propre as the rock star's look of surly self-obsession. </p> <p>Yet to say as much is to equate the whole of romanticism with what might be called its 'wild side'. Ask a student of European literature to name a romantic figure and it is likely that Byron will seem to fit the description better than Wordsworth. Ask a student of art history and probably Eugene Delacroix rather than Jean Auguste Ingres (both the subject of separate chapters here) would probably seem best to satisfy the romantic ideal. </p> <p>But this is, in part, because the ideals which were actually current during the romantic period have themselves been subsequently 'romanticised'. With her own neoclassical blend of delicacy and confidence, Brookner reminds us that romanticism was a reactive movement, and its manifestations necessarily preserve characteristics of the ideology which it was reacting against. </p> <p>In the fine arts, what this means is that the aesthetic ideology of romanticism incorporates, with degrees of strain which vary from one artist to another, elements of neo-classical aesthetics. This is particularly obvious in the case of Louis David's picture, Napoleon Crossing the Alps, where the clearly delineated forms express an elegance creatively in tension with the energies both of the horse's movement and of Napoleon's concentrated purposefulness.</p> <p>But, as Brookner shows, in a sequence of chapters dealing predominantly, and in roughly chronological order, with three painters (Antoine-Jean Gros, Delacroix and Ingres) and five writers (Musset, Baudelaire, the Goncourts, Zola and Huysmans), it is the balance of tendencies which determines the character of an artist's work, and this varies according to his allegiances in general. </p> <p>Thus, David is fundamentally a conservative artist in whose work elements of the new radicalism are temperately permitted to emerge. Ingres, 30 years his junior, shares the same conservative temperament and, hence, clarity of line, but because his own interests impel him to disrupt the cultural traditions he is anxious to preserve, the tension within his work is correspondingly more patent and acute. In Delacroix, however, the preoccupation with the wilder side of romanticism entails a brusque displacement of neo-classical norms. </p> <p>These discriminations, so finely made by Brookner, are important because of the general point that theories of aesthetic decorum are expressions of moral, social, religious and political allegiance. To oppose the authority of David, as Brookner shows Gros doing, was to oppose, however uncertainly, the central beliefs about human nature and how life should be conducted which David's theories stood for. </p> <p>The exuberance of opposition subsequently reached such a height, however, that we are now living out the consequences of losing our hold on the values which pre-romantic cultural traditions sought to conserve. The present book, I believe, is the outcome of a conflict between the values implicit in Brookner's own wisely conservative artistry and the post-romantic iconoclasm of contemporary culture. </p> <p>Brookner defends by example the neo-classical virtues of elegance, subtlety, candour and impassioned restraint.

There is, for example, the remembered 'dread of imminent exposure' when dining out with his parents in Leeds; the tale of his Uncle Norris who discovered the cure for arthritis, namely cutting the feet out of his socks; and the rerun of Bennett's pious teenage anxiety that he might catch VD from the Eucharist on Christmas Eve, when the congregation was swelled with sinners. </p> <p>These party pieces, made word perfect over the years, are punctuated by halting memento mori, as when he explains how he very nearly became a vicar, primarily because he looked like one: 'This is not as silly as it sounds,' he intones softly to camera, blinking a little through his glasses. 'People often end up doing what the mirror tells them they are suited for, while feeling themselves quite different inside. And in the process whole lifetimes are thrown away.' </p> <p>The 10-part series of short films, which begins next Saturday, seems part of an inclination in Bennett's most recent work to take personal stock. His friend, Sir Richard Eyre, sees it as the culmination of a familiar method. 'Alan is very systematic in working the narrow seams of his raw material,' he says. 'There was a Kafka theme; a royalty theme; a spying theme; and in this portfolio there is also a file marked \"Alan Bennett\". He approaches each of these subjects in the same way; he exhaustively mines his material for all it is worth.' </p> <p> The file marked 'Alan Bennett' contains the familiar version of himself that the playwright wants his audience to know, and perhaps to love. 'I'd rather the public had an image, and not quite fit it,' he once remarked. 'That way, you're free.' This freedom is carefully guarded. Bennett, now 60, never does press interviews these days, on the grounds that he feels 'less afterwards', although he was happy to be photographed for this piece. </p> <p>He is said to be troubled by an unauthorised biography, to be written by the comedy writer, Alex Games, which will be published next year. Bennett, characteristically, has reportedly been torn about whether to ask his friends not to contribute to the book; Games described to me his method of researching this most private of writers as being like 'keyhole surgery'. 'Alan has a need to be in control of things to a certain extent, certainly,' says Eyre. 'The idea of a public celebrity appearance, as himself, as the real Alan Bennett, is something that would fill him with absolute horror.' </p> <p>Some instinct of quiet control asserted itself from the outset of Bennett's career. In Humphrey Carpenter's recent account of the genesis of Beyond the Fringe, it is Bennett who comes across as the sternest and most exacting of the inspired quartet. Jonathan Miller, still Bennett's neighbour, confides that he always felt as though he was 'regarded by Alan as a sort of frivolous, non-contributing dilettante, whose capering around on stage got more attention than he, the diligent writer, got'. (Bennett, for his part, recalls how Miller, 'with characteristic extravagance, once threw a tea service at me. Though again characteristically, it missed'.) </p> <p>Dudley Moore was, in his own recollection, dismissed altogether by Bennett after hamming to the audience during a sketch. Though the pair had been in the habit of dining together before each show, from then on, Moore recalls: 'He never spoke to me. It was as though he had never met me. We never went out for a meal again. Nothing.' </p> <p>Still, the impetus to confession in Telling Tales, is not, it seems, simply a question of getting his version of stories in first. In recent articles, he has talked of clearing his shelves, of sorting out mental lumber, this, in part, in response, you might suppose, to a serious illness that he suffered a couple of years ago, from which he has recovered (and about which he does not speak). Last year, in particular, in a piece called 'Untold Stories', in which he detailed for the first time the extent of his mother's depression, there was a sense of him putting his house in order. </p> <p>The memoir placed his writing about his family history, the bedrock of his work, in a poignant context. When Bennett suggested in the past that 'we must love one another or die - of embarrassment', it had been easy to take the reference lightly, a wry comment on the strangled social awkwardnesses he so delights in exploring. </p> <p>In a sense though, Bennett's mother did die from embarrassment. 'Wanting to go unnoticed is what Mam's depression is about,' he wrote, recalling, as if it were yesterday, the day in 1966 when he and his father took her to Lancaster Moor Hospital, committing her to a psychiatric ward of 'unimagined wretchedness', and the innumerable hospital visits of the years that followed. She had found the Dales village to which she had moved from 'mucky Leeds' daunting and impossible because she felt the 'centrepiece there'; she had refused in the same spirit, as Bennett discovered in researching his memoir, a proper wedding, getting married at eight in the morning so as not to draw attention to herself. She wanted, in effect, to disappear from life. </p> <p> Until he was faced with his mother's depression, Bennett had always tended to think of neurosis as something 'put on', a way of making oneself interesting, and in this sense he imagined himself neurotic. Her condition forced him to come to terms with what he calls the 'mundane mad', and to explore that often painfully comic line between eccentricity and insanity, which is at the heart of his best work. In some ways, you could view nearly all of his writing of the last three decades as an attempt to understand that distinction for himself. The Madness of King George, The Lady in the Van, Talking Heads all have one thing in common: they are narratives of people who, in Bennett's terms, are part of a 'story to the meaning of which they are not entirely privy'. People, in this respect, like his mother. </p> <p>In a brilliant valedictory essay on Philip Larkin, who was an inspiration as a writer to Bennett, and against whose wilful bitterness he seems to judge his humanity, Bennett quotes the poet as having written that: 'My mother is such a bloody rambling fool that half the time I doubt her sanity. Two things she said today for instance were that she had thought of \"getting a job in Woolworths\" and that she wanted to \"win the football pools so she could give cocktail parties\".' </p> <p>In quoting this, Bennett notes how his own mother might have had similar aspirations, particularly about the cocktail parties, and in these passages you can see him marvelling at Larkin's liberating cruelty, and measuring it against his own more complicated compassion: his desire to do his best by his Mam, and his need to understand her legacy in himself. </p> <p>In the past, he has used a line from a Borges story to describe his own feelings as a comic writer, mining his family's life for 'material', which perhaps in this context can be understood: 'All the books he ever published filled him with a complex feeling of repentance.' </p> <p>Michael Frayn, who has known Bennett since National Service days, when they studied Russian together, and is now also a neighbour, suggests that 'what a lot of his work is about is the moment when people wake up to the fact that they have passionate feelings, feelings they did not, by background or circumstance, think themselves capable of; these might be passionate sexual feelings, or passionate violent feelings'. In some ways, he imagines, this is a catharsis that Bennett has felt echoes of in his own life, but if it is, it is not one that he has ever directly publicly addressed. </p> <p> In his most candid interview, with the New Yorker in 1993, Bennett explained how: 'I'd always been in love with guys... but always unhappily. They were straight and it was always totally unfulfilled... I was interested in sex, and whichever way any sex came along you just had to take it - that's how it seemed to me.' In this spirit, perhaps, Bennett then revealed that he had, for the previous 17 years, been enjoying a relationship with Anne Davies, 15 years his junior, who had once been employed as the cleaner in his London house. Bennett had bought Anne ('a reformed hippy') a tea shop in Clapham, the Dales village where his father and mother lived in later life, and where he kept a house (the same house in which his mother imagined intruders behind the pantry door; heard voices conversing in the living-room, and stood stock-still for hours in the hall, waiting for their chatter to stop). </p> <p>Davies set up home in Clapham with a younger lover, a dry-stone waller from Devon. She saw Bennett about once a month, she subsequently explained: 'He was always gay but he thought men didn't like him. It's like not being picked for the team at school... I was the only woman he had ever been close to... I was like an earthquake, turning his life upside down with my kids and lovers and mess.' </p> <p>Davies turned Clapham upside down, too, going barefoot in all weathers, wearing bells on her ankles; she was banned from the local pub, and scandalised locals by admitting on one occasion that she had daubed expletives on a heritage sign. In some ways, it seemed, she was another of Bennett's unruly alter egos (along with his late friends, Peter Cook and Russell Harty, in whose shamelessness he revelled), and you could imagine the attraction, the blissful private joke, of putting this woman at the centre of village life, the conventions of which had so hemmed his mother in. </p> <p>'Most men,' he once wrote, again with Larkin in mind, 'regard their life as a poem which women threaten.' For all his anxieties about his upbringing and his sexuality, Bennett has been conscious in his efforts to prevent his existence from being as miserably precious as the poet's. </p> <p>Unlike Larkin, he has created for himself a place where he can be comfortable with metropolitan life. His house, friends say, is a monument to his passion for home decor; he is a great cook: 'His kitchen,' one acquaintance told me, 'which you might expect to look like something from the 1950s, is actually a place where Nigella Lawson would feel very much at home.' </p> <p>Five years ago, Anne Davies remarked how Bennett had been involved, too, in a successful homosexual relationship, and that relationship continues. And, moreover, he has managed, as his diaries reveal, to make much of his life seem like one of his own amusing creations. (Richard Eyre believes that the kind of anecdote for which Bennett is famous tends to 'seek him out... when you are with Alan,' he says, 'you feel that his particular perception of the world is so powerful that the world itself becomes Bennettesque around him'.) </p> <p>'Art begins with imitation, often in the form of parody,' Bennett once observed, 'and it's in the process of imitating the voices of others that one comes to learn the sound of one's own.' He has spent his career and his life, in this sense, learning to love the sound of his own voice. One of the great pleasures of Telling Tales , and there are many, is to listen to that voice in all of its complex maturity; another is to hear behind those tales it tells, the ghosts of the tales he leaves out.</p>",

This love is intricate, consuming and elegiac. And, though the mood is essentially European - say mid-career Truffaut, with a whisper of Brief Encounter - the setting is far away in the Hong Kong of the early Sixties. Wong Kar-Wai, chameleon amongst great directors, has done it again. </p> <p>Tony Leung Chiu-Wai is Mr Chow, a thirtysomething journalist with a pretty wife. Maggie Cheung Man-Yuk is Mrs Chow, a super secretary married to a travelling businessman. The couples find rooms to live in adjoining flats. Slowly, it dawns on Leung and Cheung that their increasingly absent partners are having an affair. Slowly, Leung begins his pursuit of the wronged wife and she begins to descend into an agony of doubt. If she succumbs, will she be any better than her faithless husband? </p> <p>Wong Kar-Wai does everything: action movies, cop movies, epics, often with a French new-wave feel of improvisation. Here, there is none of that. Instead, we move meticulously from one little box to the next, from one poky room to the room next door. Other rooms in the apartment block are filmed down corridors or over shoulders; the only excursions beyond are into deserted streets where rain falls torrentially around the sheltering pair. Complete claustrophobia. We never see the faces of the adulterous husband or his mistress, only their backs: they are ciphers throwing Leung and Cheung into starker relief. </p> <p>Does that sound a trifle dour? It isn't. The family who rent Cheung her room are warm and effusive, always offering food and companionship. Leung's hoary journalist mate is rounded and jolly. There is human life just across the landing or at the office; the characters are rooted in place and time - but that time, too, matters. Falling in love in the Hong Kong of four decades ago isn't a quick, modern fling. You feel the brooding disapproval of a more traditional Chinese society. Contacts must be secret, emotions hidden. Celia Johnson looks out of the railway carriage window. Upper lips stiffen and then quiver. When Cheung is trapped - innocently enough - in Leung's bedroom overnight, because others are playing mah-jong outside, there's no question of a quick roll on the bed. Cheung lies there alone, imprisoned by inhibition. </p> <p>Wong Kar-Wai is never entirely unobtrusive. The director's presence remains constant - sometimes playing jokes, like rehearsals of the farewell speeches Cheung will make to her husband, which appear, for a moment, to be the real thing. But that constant presence merely focuses us more hypnotically on the central relationship; and upon a particular sequence of months and passions locked away, resistance eroding as the mood takes hold. </p> <p>It doesn't work completely. Leung and Cheung are two of China's most f\u00eated stars, one stubby, battered and thoughtfully bemused, the other sinuous and tortured. They hold the screen and the still, silent Leung is especially hypnotic as he calculates and manipulates. But Cheung has an almost impossibly testing role. Can she make us, as twenty-first-century spectators, comprehend and share her inner turmoil? Can she become somebody we not only understand intellectually, but weep for in her desperate dilemma of the soul? </p> <p>Maybe Truffaut could have got that from Nathalie Baye, because her face is infinitely expressive and part of a world we understand. Cheung cannot quite convey that. She agonises, but she can't draw us in. The gap between eras and cultures is too great. The background score, by Mike Galasso, plonks away, sometimes Nat King Cole, sometimes second-hand Michel Legrand, so that you know you ought to understand. But no - you can see the suffering, yet you don't feel it. A love story without the hint of tear. </p> <p>But for all that this is an accomplished and memorable film, one that Wong Kar-Wai fought to finish through two years of censorship and Eastern financial crisis. Why should the censors have worried? There is no sex here, no sweaty coupling. This is love pursued, love won, love lost; love as a mingling of minds and calculation; love as regret. The chameleon called love.</p>",

But no - you can see the suffering, yet you don't feel it. A love story without the hint of tear. But for all that this is an accomplished and memorable film, one that Wong Kar-Wai fought to finish through two years of censorship and Eastern financial crisis. Why should the censors have worried? There is no sex here, no sweaty coupling. This is love pursued, love won, love lost; love as a mingling of minds and calculation; love as regret. The chameleon called love.",

But the report to be published in the British Journal of Psychiatry this week is expected to conclude that the figures show a serious impact on many women.</p> <p>The effect was most clearly seen in women aged 25 to 44. Normally, it is women over 45 who are most at risk of taking their own lives.</p> <p>The study's authors, among them Professor Keith Hawton of the suicide research unit at the University of Oxford and Louis Appleby, a mental health expert, believe their work will prompt further studies on the affects of major events concerning well-known celebrities.</p> <p>However, psychiatrists and sociologists point out that most of the deaths occurred among people who were already feeling suicidal.</p> <p>Professor Cary Cooper, of the University of Manchester, said: 'Diana's death is not going to have caused anybody to kill themselves, rather it will have been a trigger to many who were predisposed to taking their lives.</p> <p>'It is important to remember that people who will have had such an extreme reaction to Diana's death will have been those already feeling irrational, despondent and depressed.</p> <p>'The reason the event affected so many women is that they are more likely to have related to Diana through the stresses and strains they saw in her life. Alternatively, some may have thought \"well, there's a young woman who had it all and what's the point in me living when you could just go like that at any time?\"</p> <p>'I think there was a lot of guilt when the princess died. People felt very bad at having been part of a society which wanted to know the titbits and read the papers and the magazines avidly. Perhaps had we not dogged her so much she would not have been speeding away in a car from press and cameramen.'</p> <p>His remarks were backed by the Samaritans' spokeswoman Julie Alexander, who said there had been a marked increase in calls to their helplines around the time of the death and funeral.</p> <p>'But we wouldn't say her death caused anyone to kill themselves. It is never anyone else's fault when someone takes their own life.</p> <p>'Self-harm is a noticeable factor. Self-harm rates have been going up quite worry-ingly. It is a massive issue.'</p> <p><br><a href=\"mailto:tracy.mcveigh@observer.co.uk\">tracy.mcveigh@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Public grief at the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, took a far more tragic twist in Britain than had been previously thought. New research shows there was a dramatic increase in women either committing suicide or acts of self-harm in the days directly after Diana died in a car crash on 31 August 1997. In the week following the accident there was a 33.7 per cent rise in suicides among women in England and Wales and the overall suicide rate, for men and women, increased by 17.4 per cent in the month after her funeral. Deliberate self-harm - usually attempted suicides - rose by 65.1 per cent in the first week of September 1997. Previous theories claimed that 'social cohesion' - people drawing together with a sense of shared sorrow which was experienced in America when JFK was assassinated - had prevented any upsurge. But the report to be published in the British Journal of Psychiatry this week is expected to conclude that the figures show a serious impact on many women. The effect was most clearly seen in women aged 25 to 44. Normally, it is women over 45 who are most at risk of taking their own lives. The study's authors, among them Professor Keith Hawton of the suicide research unit at the University of Oxford and Louis Appleby, a mental health expert, believe their work will prompt further studies on the affects of major events concerning well-known celebrities. However, psychiatrists and sociologists point out that most of the deaths occurred among people who were already feeling suicidal. Professor Cary Cooper, of the University of Manchester, said: 'Diana's death is not going to have caused anybody to kill themselves, rather it will have been a trigger to many who were predisposed to taking their lives. 'It is important to remember that people who will have had such an extreme reaction to Diana's death will have been those already feeling irrational, despondent and depressed. 'The reason the event affected so many women is that they are more likely to have related to Diana through the stresses and strains they saw in her life. Alternatively, some may have thought \"well, there's a young woman who had it all and what's the point in me living when you could just go like that at any time?\" 'I think there was a lot of guilt when the princess died. People felt very bad at having been part of a society which wanted to know the titbits and read the papers and the magazines avidly. Perhaps had we not dogged her so much she would not have been speeding away in a car from press and cameramen.' His remarks were backed by the Samaritans' spokeswoman Julie Alexander, who said there had been a marked increase in calls to their helplines around the time of the death and funeral. 'But we wouldn't say her death caused anyone to kill themselves. It is never anyone else's fault when someone takes their own life. 'Self-harm is a noticeable factor. Self-harm rates have been going up quite worry-ingly. It is a massive issue.' tracy.mcveigh@observer.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "Henry McDonald, in his column of 22 October (page 31, Irish edition), headed 'In peace, truth dies', directed extremely serious and entirely unfounded accusations against the Irish News. Mr McDonald's article referred to a 'corrosion of journalistic values', and went on to assert that large sections of the Irish media had ignored 'uncomfortable facts' in an attempt to protect the Good Friday Agreement. He singled out the Irish News for criticism in this regard, and specifically alleged that we initially suggested that the recent murder of Joseph O'Connor in west Belfast was the work of the Continuity IRA rather than the Provisional IRA. No one who has read the coverage provided by the Irish News in the wake of the killing could possibly recognise this version of events. Mr O'Connor was shot dead on Friday 13 October. The Irish News of the following day was the first news organisation to carry an interview with the O'Connor family, and the first to report the belief of some of the close relatives of the victim that he had been shot by the Provisional IRA. This story was published on our front page, under the headline 'It was the Provos, says victim's mother', and was extensively followed up by other sections of the media - including The Observer. Reports in the Irish News over the following week followed a similar theme. On Thursday 19 October, an Irish News editorial said: 'Although the Provisional IRA has formally denied involvement in the killing of Mr O'Connor, few people in west Belfast have any doubts about who was responsible.' We went on to list three other recent high-profile murders which were widely believed to have been carried out by the Provisional IRA, despite official statements of denial from the organisation. In the light of this comprehensive range of material, it was astonishing that Mr McDonald should set out to imply that we had attempted to blame elements other than the Provisionals for the O'Connor murder.

      "body": "<p>They are some of the most famous names in English football, evoking memories of an era when fans all wore flat caps, players earned just a few shillings and television coverage was black and white, not digital interactive.</p> <p>But now a host of clubs synonymous with the game's 'golden era', such as Blackpool, Stoke City and Preston North End, are threatened with extinction. A hard-hitting new report warns that scores of the smaller teams among the country's 92 professional clubs could go to the wall because of Europe's controversial drive to scrap transfer fees for players switching clubs.</p> <p>Leading accountants Deloitte and Touche predict many clubs could either be put out of business, forced to go part-time or be left having to sack players to survive if they are deprived of the income selling talent brings.</p> <p>They warn that the romance and unpredictability of the domestic game's chase for trophies, and the potential for smaller clubs to beat bigger rivals, will disappear as football becomes increasingly polarised between a rich elite and a much larger number of poor outfits struggling just to stay afloat.</p> <p>Money currently spent on transfer fees would instead fund hugely increased wages for top stars, who already earn an average \u00a38,000-a-week in the Premier League. Tens of millions of pounds a year would thus leave the game to fund even more lavish lifestyles for players rather than circulating between clubs as a rich-to-poor subsidy.</p> <p>The English tradition of at least one football team in almost every big town could be at risk as the game is dominated more and more by well-supported big city sides, the study says.</p> <p>'Football's current [transfer] system helps to bridge the gap not only between big and small, but also geographically, ensuring that football survives in smaller towns, protecting local economies, jobs, identity, pride and social well-being,' the report warns. 'The transfer system is a force for cohesion.'</p> <p>Deloitte and Touche forecast that ending transfer fees, which the European Commission insists are illegal, will ruin the game as we know it. European football has until Tuesday to try and persuade the EC not to press ahead with its widely criticised plan. But hopes of a compromise have been hit by feuding between the football authorities and the body representing Europe's players.</p> <p>EC competition commissioner Mario Monti claims transfer payments restrict a player's freedom under the Treaty of Rome to work where he likes. Big-money moves such as Luis Figo's \u00a337 million switch last summer from Barcelona to Real Madrid have angered EC officials.</p> <p>Uefa, European football's governing body, commissioned the accountants to analyse the likely effects across the continent of outlawing transfer fees, which have existed since 1890. The report backs Uefa's claim they are a vital method of redistributing wealth from well-off clubs and countries to their needier rivals and thus ensuring their viability.</p> <p>It shows that clubs in the Football League receive tens of millions of pounds a year more in fees from their more glamorous Premier League counterparts than they spend buying players from the top flight.

      "bodyText": "They are some of the most famous names in English football, evoking memories of an era when fans all wore flat caps, players earned just a few shillings and television coverage was black and white, not digital interactive. But now a host of clubs synonymous with the game's 'golden era', such as Blackpool, Stoke City and Preston North End, are threatened with extinction. A hard-hitting new report warns that scores of the smaller teams among the country's 92 professional clubs could go to the wall because of Europe's controversial drive to scrap transfer fees for players switching clubs. Leading accountants Deloitte and Touche predict many clubs could either be put out of business, forced to go part-time or be left having to sack players to survive if they are deprived of the income selling talent brings. They warn that the romance and unpredictability of the domestic game's chase for trophies, and the potential for smaller clubs to beat bigger rivals, will disappear as football becomes increasingly polarised between a rich elite and a much larger number of poor outfits struggling just to stay afloat. Money currently spent on transfer fees would instead fund hugely increased wages for top stars, who already earn an average \u00a38,000-a-week in the Premier League. Tens of millions of pounds a year would thus leave the game to fund even more lavish lifestyles for players rather than circulating between clubs as a rich-to-poor subsidy. The English tradition of at least one football team in almost every big town could be at risk as the game is dominated more and more by well-supported big city sides, the study says. 'Football's current [transfer] system helps to bridge the gap not only between big and small, but also geographically, ensuring that football survives in smaller towns, protecting local economies, jobs, identity, pride and social well-being,' the report warns. 'The transfer system is a force for cohesion.' Deloitte and Touche forecast that ending transfer fees, which the European Commission insists are illegal, will ruin the game as we know it. European football has until Tuesday to try and persuade the EC not to press ahead with its widely criticised plan. But hopes of a compromise have been hit by feuding between the football authorities and the body representing Europe's players. EC competition commissioner Mario Monti claims transfer payments restrict a player's freedom under the Treaty of Rome to work where he likes. Big-money moves such as Luis Figo's \u00a337 million switch last summer from Barcelona to Real Madrid have angered EC officials. Uefa, European football's governing body, commissioned the accountants to analyse the likely effects across the continent of outlawing transfer fees, which have existed since 1890. The report backs Uefa's claim they are a vital method of redistributing wealth from well-off clubs and countries to their needier rivals and thus ensuring their viability. It shows that clubs in the Football League receive tens of millions of pounds a year more in fees from their more glamorous Premier League counterparts than they spend buying players from the top flight. This redistribution of wealth is vital to cover losses in the lower leagues caused by poor crowds, lack of sponsorship and minimal television revenue. Deloitte and Touche's examination of football clubs' finances shows many get over half their income from transfers. If this goes, minnows of the game such as Crewe Alexandra and Darlington, which have to sell to survive, would be at risk. 'The majority of players would undergo a reduction in salaries and/or lose their jobs as clubs reduce the number of full-time players or go part-time,' says the report. Production of young players would also be decimated because, with players able to leave for free, clubs would no longer have a financial incentive to nurture talent. Football League spokesman John Nagle said the report was 'overly pessimistic. Clubs are a lot more resilient than some people think.' denis.campbell@observer.co.uk",

The potential of the Ucav to drop nuclear weapons has been discussed, although a spokesperson said its range exceeded that which, under international regulations, an unmanned aircraft could travel with a nuclear payload. The technology will not be operational until 2010, but questions are already being asked about its impact on the future of war. The Ucav is one of five new areas being explored for defence purposes. Together with robotics, the US Department of Defense is also looking at ways of exploiting advanced power and propulsion, miniaturisation, mobile digital networks and biological sciences. 'We are not very far along in really exploring what these technologies may offer,' said Andrew Marshall, who heads the US military's long-term planning group, the Office of Net Assessment. Robotic surveillance snakes, genetically altered biological weapons to pick out healthy males in a crowd and spy helicopters the size of an atom are among combat systems under consideration. 'It's inevitable,' said Cook. 'If you take the design in the round, Ucav has been in the pipeline since 1990. It's a third of the price of an F16, and a quarter of the price of a Tornado. This technology is unstoppable.' nick.walsh@observer.co.uk",

Perhaps you struggle hopelessly, hide your feelings if others take a dislike to you, and can't understand why no one can see the hidden meanings in the world around you? If so, help is at hand: unexplained longings to behave in certain ways are hidden clues to our origins, according to a new book which has been described as a work of genius by evolutionary experts. 'This concept is based on the idea that we're not born with clean slates but embryonic characters inherited from our ancestors, handed down from species to species,' said Terence Watts, director of the Institute of Clinical Hypnosis, who has spent the last four years developing the Freud-based theory.

'The problem is now that people are all jumbled up and are forced to live in ways opposed to the way they're programmed,' said Watts, who created Quintic Warrior , a top computer game of the mid-Eighties, before he stumbled over the theory during his training as an analyst. 'Thus predominantly warrior children are told by predominantly settler mothers that their natural instincts are wrong. They are taught to suppress their natural urges and be ashamed of them,' he said. 'We spend all our time trying to be people we're not and apologising for someone else's mistake.

      "body": "<p>Dogs are given more leg room on planes than humans. Strict guidelines on canines travelling in the cargo hold mean they must be able to turn round in comfort - unlike their human masters in economy class.</p> <p>It means that dogs have to be held in containers twice their width, enabling them to stretch, turn round and ensure their circulation does not suffer. By contrast, the minimum amount of space required for humans is 26in between the back of the seat cushion and the seat in front - and that is before the person ahead reclines the seat.</p> <p>Tristan Bradfield, assistant manager at the Animal Reception Centre at Heathrow, who deals with the containers on a daily basis, said: 'There is more room in a minimum requirement box than in an economy-class seat. For dogs to turn round, the box must be twice the width of the animal. It's like having double-width seats.'</p> <p>Horses also have an advantage over humans in waiting time.

      "bodyText": "Dogs are given more leg room on planes than humans. Strict guidelines on canines travelling in the cargo hold mean they must be able to turn round in comfort - unlike their human masters in economy class. It means that dogs have to be held in containers twice their width, enabling them to stretch, turn round and ensure their circulation does not suffer. By contrast, the minimum amount of space required for humans is 26in between the back of the seat cushion and the seat in front - and that is before the person ahead reclines the seat. Tristan Bradfield, assistant manager at the Animal Reception Centre at Heathrow, who deals with the containers on a daily basis, said: 'There is more room in a minimum requirement box than in an economy-class seat. For dogs to turn round, the box must be twice the width of the animal. It's like having double-width seats.' Horses also have an advantage over humans in waiting time. Horses are not supposed to be on board an aircraft for more than 30 minutes before take-off, and for 30 minutes after landing. Passenger comfort and well-being are not at present regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority, which only requires 26in between the back cushion of a seat and the seat in front.

      "body": "<p>The hills that surround Bogot\u00e1 were wrapped with long, low strands of cloud. The sky was a flat, greasy grey. Beyond the huge municipal dump, the sprawling city ended abruptly. After the maze of corrugated-iron roofs, wires and TV aerials of the squatter camps, the hillsides were an abrupt green.</p> <p>Oscar Ruiz and his wife, Martha, and their four children can just see the hills if they walk to the highest point of their barrio (slum neighbourhood). But they haven't been out of Bogot\u00e1 since they arrived.</p> <p>Fifteen months ago, the family were forced to flee the farm in the jungles of the far south of Colombia that had been their home for 15 years. Oscar says that to walk among hills above his slum neighbourhood would make him homesick. Anyway, he adds, wounds he received from right-wing paramilitaries who evicted him make exercise difficult.</p> <p>Oscar is a desplacado - one of 35,000 'displaced' by the filthy, decade-long war that blights Colombia, once one of Latin America's richest states.</p> <p>Many flee rural areas for the relative safety of the cities, particularly Bogot\u00e1. Oscar's home is close to Bol\u00edvar, the biggest of the squatter camps that ring the city like a skin disease. Jes\u00fas, my taxi driver, said it would be too dangerous to take a gringo into its winding, rubbish-strewn lanes.</p> <p>In the dusk, Bol\u00edvar, named after the liberator who freed much of the region from Spanish colonial rule, looked strangely beautiful. Tens of thousands of softly lit shack windows stretched all the way up to the ridge and the mild evening sky.</p> <p>As we drove through the barrio's outer streets, my taxi driver Jes\u00fas, who himself lives on squatted land, spoke of gang fights, drugs wars and 10-year-olds addicted to glue. Few can afford cocaine, even at $10 a gram.</p> <p>Crime in Bol\u00edvar is so bad that shopkeepers and residents have whip-rounds to hire assassins to kill suspected wrongdoers.</p> <p>Many of the inhabitants of Bol\u00edvar and other barrios are desplacados who, like Oscar, have fled from one battlefield only to end up trapped in another. There are bitter turf wars between right-wing paramilitary groups and the left-wing Farc (Armed Revolutionary Front of Colombia) over homes. Currently, in Bol\u00edvar at least, the Farc is, Jes\u00fas said, the de facto local authority.</p> <p>A battle between the Farc and the right-wing paramilitaries (who share responsibility for the massacres, gang-rapes, kidnappings and disappearances that scar Colombia's recent history) forced Oscar off his coffee, banana and dairy farm in the southern Putumayo district last year.</p> <p>Putumayo is the hottest combat zone in the country, close to some of the biggest coca-growing areas. In many ways, the battle there is over cocaine. Both the guerrillas and the paramilitaries, who are funded by landowners and have strong links to the Colombian military, try to control the population through intimidation.</p> <p>In the last year, to pre-empt Plan Colombia - the massive American military aid package designed to win the war against the guerrillas for the government - the guerrillas launched new offensives. And the paramilitaries responded.</p> <p>In September last year, 40 heavily armed paramilitaries walked onto Oscar's farm. 'You have been collaborating with the guerrillas,' they told him. 'You must leave your land.'</p> <p>There was little that the slight, softly spoken Oscar could say in defence. When, on several occasions, the Farc arrived at the farm wanting breakfast, he had fed them. 'What else was I to do?' he asked me.</p> <p>The paras gave him a week to leave. He refused to go. After eight days, they smashed his door, took his eldest son hostage and then shot Oscar when he tried to stop them. Two bullets hit his arm, two his belly and one his shin.</p> <p>He managed to run away and hurl himself into the river nearby, which marks the border with Ecuador. Fished out by an Indian in a canoe, he spent the next six months convalescing across the border before returning to find his family in Bogot\u00e1.</p> <p>Or some of his family. His eldest son had remained a prisoner of the paramilitaries. After eight months in captivity, he had escaped and, amazingly, found his family in Bogot\u00e1. But he had changed. The paras made him kill a man, and he had been splattered with his victim's blood and brains. They injected him with drugs. He had been driven insane. He died in Oscar's arms in a Bogot\u00e1 hospital, only 11 years old. 'My last memory of him,' says Oscar, 'is of his eyes staring out of his skull. He had seen things no one should see.'</p> <p>Now life is a struggle for food and warmth. The six of them live in a small room. Oscar, who is 34, occasionally gets some work as a labourer. Otherwise they live on handouts. The government has aid programmes for the desplacados, but corruption and inefficiency means most is siphoned off into the rich elite's offshore bank accounts.</p> <p>Oscar has been arrested for protesting over this 'robbery' of the aid his family needs.</p> <p>He is not afraid to be named, though he does not want to be photographed. He plans to organise more demonstrations. 'Tell the world about these bastards who are taking the bread from our mouths,' he tells me.</p> <p>Jes\u00fas shakes his head as he turns the taxi back towards the centre of town, the good hotels and expensive restaurants and the shopping malls where you can buy \u00a3100 handbags. 'Someone will kill him soon,' he says sadly. 'He is making too much noise.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "The hills that surround Bogot\u00e1 were wrapped with long, low strands of cloud. The sky was a flat, greasy grey. Beyond the huge municipal dump, the sprawling city ended abruptly. After the maze of corrugated-iron roofs, wires and TV aerials of the squatter camps, the hillsides were an abrupt green. Oscar Ruiz and his wife, Martha, and their four children can just see the hills if they walk to the highest point of their barrio (slum neighbourhood). But they haven't been out of Bogot\u00e1 since they arrived. Fifteen months ago, the family were forced to flee the farm in the jungles of the far south of Colombia that had been their home for 15 years. Oscar says that to walk among hills above his slum neighbourhood would make him homesick. Anyway, he adds, wounds he received from right-wing paramilitaries who evicted him make exercise difficult. Oscar is a desplacado - one of 35,000 'displaced' by the filthy, decade-long war that blights Colombia, once one of Latin America's richest states. Many flee rural areas for the relative safety of the cities, particularly Bogot\u00e1. Oscar's home is close to Bol\u00edvar, the biggest of the squatter camps that ring the city like a skin disease. Jes\u00fas, my taxi driver, said it would be too dangerous to take a gringo into its winding, rubbish-strewn lanes. In the dusk, Bol\u00edvar, named after the liberator who freed much of the region from Spanish colonial rule, looked strangely beautiful. Tens of thousands of softly lit shack windows stretched all the way up to the ridge and the mild evening sky. As we drove through the barrio's outer streets, my taxi driver Jes\u00fas, who himself lives on squatted land, spoke of gang fights, drugs wars and 10-year-olds addicted to glue. Few can afford cocaine, even at $10 a gram. Crime in Bol\u00edvar is so bad that shopkeepers and residents have whip-rounds to hire assassins to kill suspected wrongdoers. Many of the inhabitants of Bol\u00edvar and other barrios are desplacados who, like Oscar, have fled from one battlefield only to end up trapped in another. There are bitter turf wars between right-wing paramilitary groups and the left-wing Farc (Armed Revolutionary Front of Colombia) over homes. Currently, in Bol\u00edvar at least, the Farc is, Jes\u00fas said, the de facto local authority. A battle between the Farc and the right-wing paramilitaries (who share responsibility for the massacres, gang-rapes, kidnappings and disappearances that scar Colombia's recent history) forced Oscar off his coffee, banana and dairy farm in the southern Putumayo district last year. Putumayo is the hottest combat zone in the country, close to some of the biggest coca-growing areas. In many ways, the battle there is over cocaine. Both the guerrillas and the paramilitaries, who are funded by landowners and have strong links to the Colombian military, try to control the population through intimidation. In the last year, to pre-empt Plan Colombia - the massive American military aid package designed to win the war against the guerrillas for the government - the guerrillas launched new offensives. And the paramilitaries responded. In September last year, 40 heavily armed paramilitaries walked onto Oscar's farm. 'You have been collaborating with the guerrillas,' they told him. 'You must leave your land.' There was little that the slight, softly spoken Oscar could say in defence. When, on several occasions, the Farc arrived at the farm wanting breakfast, he had fed them. 'What else was I to do?' he asked me. The paras gave him a week to leave. He refused to go. After eight days, they smashed his door, took his eldest son hostage and then shot Oscar when he tried to stop them. Two bullets hit his arm, two his belly and one his shin. He managed to run away and hurl himself into the river nearby, which marks the border with Ecuador. Fished out by an Indian in a canoe, he spent the next six months convalescing across the border before returning to find his family in Bogot\u00e1. Or some of his family. His eldest son had remained a prisoner of the paramilitaries. After eight months in captivity, he had escaped and, amazingly, found his family in Bogot\u00e1. But he had changed. The paras made him kill a man, and he had been splattered with his victim's blood and brains. They injected him with drugs. He had been driven insane. He died in Oscar's arms in a Bogot\u00e1 hospital, only 11 years old. 'My last memory of him,' says Oscar, 'is of his eyes staring out of his skull. He had seen things no one should see.' Now life is a struggle for food and warmth. The six of them live in a small room. Oscar, who is 34, occasionally gets some work as a labourer. Otherwise they live on handouts. The government has aid programmes for the desplacados, but corruption and inefficiency means most is siphoned off into the rich elite's offshore bank accounts. Oscar has been arrested for protesting over this 'robbery' of the aid his family needs. He is not afraid to be named, though he does not want to be photographed. He plans to organise more demonstrations. 'Tell the world about these bastards who are taking the bread from our mouths,' he tells me. Jes\u00fas shakes his head as he turns the taxi back towards the centre of town, the good hotels and expensive restaurants and the shopping malls where you can buy \u00a3100 handbags. 'Someone will kill him soon,' he says sadly. 'He is making too much noise.'",

      "body": "<p>There is not a flower in sight at Nikki Tibbles's west London home. The florist to the stars (her clients include almost every fashion designer in London, as well as companies including Chanel, Ralph Lauren, Ian Schrager's hotels, and Tiffany) prefers to live in a flower-free zone. There are, however, lots and lots of vases. She collects them - especially those made by the New York potter Jonathan Adler, which go perfectly with her collection of classic modern furniture.</p> <p>'I very rarely have flowers at home,' she says. 'I tend to just stick them in a vase, and then they annoy me.' On the odd occasion when she adds blooms to her home, she says she chooses something white for her ground floor living space - 'white tulips or hydrangeas' - and vibrant, clashing colours for the basement. 'I don't like that many flowers,' she confides. The ones she does like, though, she adores with a passion. She will use them en masse - a bunch of deep red, velvety Grand Prix roses packed so tightly together there isn't enough room for even the tiniest greenfly to sneak through. </p> <p>Tibbles is a one-off. Her florist business, Wild at Heart, prepares the most magnificent bunches that make an impression wherever they go. She has a way with colour - her bunches positively vibrate. 'I love clashing colours - as long as it's the right flower. I also love tones of one colour,' she says, sitting in her minimal, white Notting Hill flat, which she shares with her husband and her two dogs, Maisie and Rose. She's dressed in Chanel - a neat top and a skirt printed, appropriately enough, with camellias. Somehow, you can't quite imagine her snipping away at rose stems, or heaving armfuls of long stems out of the back of her van.</p> <p>But when Philippe Starck and Ian Schrager were putting the finishing touches to their St Martin's Lane Hotel, it was Nikki who was perched on top of a step ladder, loading oversized hydrangeas into the colossal vase that forms the centrepiece of the lobby. She left her Prada heels at home that day. She also worked with the design team, making an ironic statement with begonias in pots for the bedrooms and carnations in the restaurant. 'It was all so slightly tongue-in-cheek,' she says. 'You couldn't put begonias in any other hotel.' Predictably, both begonias and carnations have become fashionable. 'Carnations are amazing flowers,' she says. 'They have wonderful texture and colour. I think they're much maligned.' </p> <p>It is only seven years since Tibbles started out in business, with a flower stall on Turquoise Island, on fashionable Westbourne Grove. She did a degree in Sports Science, and then worked at various advertising agencies around London. 'It was the thrusting 80s, and I really wasn't very good at it,' she admits. And then a friend asked her to help put the flowers together for a wedding. 'It just suited me,' she remembers. 'I don't have a long attention span. I can't write, or paint or draw. Flowers are a great medium for me.'</p> <p>She jacked in the advertising job and went to work at a florist, for \u00a32.50 an hour. She has built up her business by trial and error. At Turquoise Island, the stall which still sells sumptuous bunches to regulars and passers-by, she worked from eight to eight every day, building up a core of loyal fans. She now employs around 30 people. Her clients include Loewe, Chanel, Cerruti, and her friend, Betty Jackson, whose house she decorated for her 50th birthday. During London Fashion Week, Tibbles decorated the celebrity-studded Philip Treacy party at Tiffany. A typical fashion party flower budget can run up to \u00a335,000, more for a big wedding. But as Tibbles says, that buys a lot of flowers. She has also worked on flowers for films, including Wilde and Wings of a Dove. </p> <p>The run-up to Christmas is one of Wild at Heart's busiest times. Over the next month, the Burberry, Tiffany and Ralph Lauren stores will all be given the Tibbles touch with tasteful, fragrant displays of Christmas cheer. There are also parties and events to organise, not to mention her own book launch at the beginning of November. </p> <p>The book, Wild at Heart, published by Conran Octopus, is a lavish, colour-saturated affair. You can almost smell the roses as you flick through its glossy pages. For most of us who do not have access to Wild at Heart's shops in west London, or at The Great Eastern Hotel in Liverpool Street, this is the next best thing. It's also about as far away from prissy flower arranging as a book about flowers can get. It's as modern in spirit as Tibbles's Future Systems architect-designed shop. 'The Wild at Heart philosophy revolves around passion and intuition, sophistication and simplicity,' she writes in the book's introduction. 'I want to show how flowers are more than an afterthought, that they are integral to an interior or an occasion.' </p> <p>Tibbles worked alongside the interiors photographer Martyn Thompson, shooting in themes ranging from 'pure' (three white vases with a single narcissus in each) and 'sensuous' (a jug filled with hyacinths) to 'chaos' (a vintage red vase crammed with overblown poppies). There is no 'how to get the look' element in the book because Tibbles felt her arrangements were pretty self-explanatory. She does not go in for exotic flowers, or anything pretentious or fancy. 'I love traditional flowers - peonies, sweet peas and roses, tulips and anemones,' she says. 'Simpler flowers. I hate flowers that are ugly, or tropical or look cheap. Yellow flowers always have that cheap look.' </p> <p>Vases are important, but she had plenty of places to borrow them from. The Westbourne Grove area is an epicentre of interiors accessories, with shops like Space, Carden Cunietti, Themes and Variations, and Vessel, who all lent jugs, vases and other containers for the pictures. The combination of vase and flower is all about scale, proportion and colour. A giant amethyst-coloured Murano glass vase, made especially for the shoot by Amy Cushing, is topped with a tiny cluster of simple blue muscari, that look as though they've just been picked from the garden. In the florist's downstairs basement, which has just had a glass extension built, looking out on to the garden, a shelf is packed with multicoloured vases, many of them vintage glass and ceramics, bought on her travels, and each of them just begging to be filled with flowers. </p> <p>The book is certainly inspirational. Just as you might try a recipe if you have easy access to the ingredients, so you will definitely be tempted to replicate some of Tibbles's floral ideas. How about a goldfish bowl full of hydrangeas? It's as easy as it sounds, but looks cool and modern. And if you only have access to carnations, just buy several bunches and cram them together tightly in a vase. You'll be amazed at how expensive they look. 'I was worried that the arrangements should be more complicated,' she says. 'It couldn't be simpler.' But that's just what makes it so inspiring.</p>",

There is no 'how to get the look' element in the book because Tibbles felt her arrangements were pretty self-explanatory. She does not go in for exotic flowers, or anything pretentious or fancy. 'I love traditional flowers - peonies, sweet peas and roses, tulips and anemones,' she says. 'Simpler flowers. I hate flowers that are ugly, or tropical or look cheap. Yellow flowers always have that cheap look.' Vases are important, but she had plenty of places to borrow them from. The Westbourne Grove area is an epicentre of interiors accessories, with shops like Space, Carden Cunietti, Themes and Variations, and Vessel, who all lent jugs, vases and other containers for the pictures. The combination of vase and flower is all about scale, proportion and colour. A giant amethyst-coloured Murano glass vase, made especially for the shoot by Amy Cushing, is topped with a tiny cluster of simple blue muscari, that look as though they've just been picked from the garden. In the florist's downstairs basement, which has just had a glass extension built, looking out on to the garden, a shelf is packed with multicoloured vases, many of them vintage glass and ceramics, bought on her travels, and each of them just begging to be filled with flowers. The book is certainly inspirational. Just as you might try a recipe if you have easy access to the ingredients, so you will definitely be tempted to replicate some of Tibbles's floral ideas. How about a goldfish bowl full of hydrangeas? It's as easy as it sounds, but looks cool and modern. And if you only have access to carnations, just buy several bunches and cram them together tightly in a vase. You'll be amazed at how expensive they look. 'I was worried that the arrangements should be more complicated,' she says. 'It couldn't be simpler.' But that's just what makes it so inspiring.",

He's definitely a New Land Rover Man. 'What's this, eh?' He asks - all glad-fellow-well-met - while casting an anxious glance at Maud's dad's number-two crop. 'Gad, wouldn't mind one of these. Any good?' Well, that depends. Do you have more than one child? 'Ah yes, got three.' Well, it's difficult with this model, but there's a double seater. It's difficult to steer with one hand, you see, because you have to push the handle down to raise the front wheels in order to turn or get up the pavement, and it's quite wide and the brakes don't work brilliantly... 'Just like the motor, eh? Haw, haw.' Back at home, getting it over our high doorstep, the chassis is scraped. The yellow paint comes off. Edie laughs. And carries on laughing as we try to get the thing down. Leaning frontways over the handle to reach the levers you end up huffing and puffing like a hunted fox. Yes, this is certainly a Land Rover. When down it doesn't fasten together, lies only flat-ish, and any attempt to move the folded vehicle results in flapping arms, bruised knees and giggling children. Presumably, one is supposed to leave the thing in the boot of the 4x4 covered in mud and then throw it ostentatiously out on to the Kensington/Putney/Bow/ pavement, letting it snap into place as it lands. Johnny, when or if he has kids, would probably like a second-hand one of these. He'd probably customise it with an old leather armchair, or something. Edie likes it, too. But then, whenever Johnny comes into our house she points at him, smiles and says, 'Dadda.'

      "body": "<p>Albert Louden is one of Britain's best-known and most successful Outsider artists. His paintings are sold at auction at Sotheby's and Christie's. A neat, shy man in black trousers and brown Chelsea boots, he sits in his living room in Leyton, east London, and talks about art and life. On the carpet next to him are copies of the new Blake biography and Isaiah Berlin's The Hedgehog and the Fox.</p> <p>The room's dull colours form a good neutral background for several small, luminous paintings which shine on the walls. The work is instantly recognisable as Louden's. There are strange cartoon-like figures, androgynes sprouting tiny humanoids along the curves of their lips and arms; bulbous men with dome-heads painted in blocks of bright pink, red and yellow; skinny domineering women; backdrops of child-like tower blocks with tiny windows and claustrophobic rooms.</p> <p>The colours have the impact of a Matisse; the strange characters betray the sneaky oddness of a surrealist's mind. Louden calls them his 'internal landscapes' and says he has no idea where they come from or what they mean. 'I think they're odd,' he says, 'but not depressing. I've destroyed sackfuls of them in the past because they came out vicious or nasty.'</p> <p>Louden is unhappy about the label 'Outsider' which originally launched him on the art scene. Thirty years after his work was first exhibited, he feels the term ghettoises him. The Outsider Art concept can be traced back to the 1930s and the paintings done by patients in a number of Swiss mental asylums. The French painter Jean Dubuffet called the work Art Brut (Raw Art). In turn, art historian Roger Cardinal coined the term 'Outsider Art'. Picasso and Klee were amongst the early artists drawn to the genre, inspired by their shared fascination with psychoanalysis.</p> <p>Because most Outsider artists steer clear of the art world and of each other's work, and have no theoretical basis or analysis for it, there is little chance of a 'movement'. They tend to work like techno producers and computer nerds, tucked away in a timeless vacuum at home; sometimes only discovered after they die. They just get on with it and are often amused and surprised that anyone will sell or buy their outpourings. Today's artists have little in common with 1930s mental asylum patients, but they do share a lack of art training and no motivation to paint-to-sell. Without exception, they have to paint or draw.</p> <p>Louden works for seven hours most days when he is not globe-trotting with his paintings. Articulate and self-educated, he was a Marxist activist in east London's labour disputes of the 60s and 70s. He used to store his huge canvases in his garden shed, but they rotted and he had to throw them out. These days, he sells paintings in New York and was recently invited to show in Quito, Peru, at the Mexican Cultural Centre. 'I sold some paintings, too! ' he laughs shyly, hand over mouth. 'The German ambassador bought one.' Louden's work appears in London galleries beyond the tiny Outsider circuit; he plans a 2001 exhibition in Mayfair.</p> <p>Louden paints in the front bedroom where weights and a fitness machine share space with yet more paintings. This is where his latest work can be found. Even though the curtains are drawn, the colour on four huge canvases pours like sunlight through cathedral windows. Clotted oils shift from one rich colour to another. But where are his Louden people? 'I've been experimenting,' he smiles. 'I always experimented, even at the beginning, abstracts as well as figures.' He reveals a mildewed scrapbook containing blurry, 20-year-old prints. Some look like Turner landscapes. 'I'd been arguing for a long time with my work, in isolation, but never came to terms with it,' he says.</p> <p>The British market for Outsider Art was first championed by the late Victor Musgrave, a leading light on the 60s art scene. He promoted the work of Britain's best known Outsider artist Scottie Wilson. Wilson, who died in 1972, was a self-taught, working-class man who specialised in intricate ink-coloured drawings of strange flippered creatures and trees filled with mythic creatures. It wasn't long before other collectors became interested. Henry Boxer started collecting visionary and mystical works in the 60s: 'These outsiders and psychotics appealed to me because they were doing things without any drugs at the time when we were using LSD and mescaline to get to the same place,' he recalls.</p> <p>George Melly has been a collector of Outsider Art for more than 30 years. For him, it fulfils a lot of what surrealism achieved. 'You lower a bucket into the mind, pull it up and examine it,' he states with relish. 'It's the lack of consciousness and self-consciousness that I like. Artists today are so self-conscious, they consider the market first, whereas for Outsiders, the thing exists of itself and they do it because they have to - whether it will sell or not. Art should be magical, and these are magical, compulsive things.'</p> <p>These days, the London art map is being re-written by a handful of maverick dealers who are specialising in this awkward genre of Outsider Art. They are viewed by the majority of dealers with almost as much suspicion as the artists they represent. The problem is that they promote work which lacks the very commodity which keeps the Hoxton-Saatchi scene alive: a concept. Instead, Outsider Art combines a contemporary edginess with irrepressible exuberance and frequently reveals a sophisticated design sense reminiscent of the tribal artists working in Africa and Australia.</p> <p>A new landmark in Outsider and Marginal art is the England &amp; Co Gallery, located in the golden retail mile of Westbourne Grove, between Agn\u00e8s b clothes and Tom Conran foodstuffs. Jane England is attracting buyers who include 'art' on their shopping lists. England is fiercely protective of the artists she exhibits, and yet she also wants to bring them to a wider audience: 'They shouldn't be treated like mushrooms and kept under a stone,' she says sternly. 'They're not freaks!'</p> <p>England's current exhibition is a collection of strange, perverse pencil drawings by a Kent geography graduate called Chris Hipkiss. Stand close enough to them and visitors disappear into intricate, alien landscapes, fields and city streets. Intriguing from a distance, close to they divulge some startling secrets: rows of women hanging upside down compose a hedge, strapping dominatrixes driving bobsleighs made from mutant trees, fields of corn cobs numbered like soldiers in a drill parade or mutated into missiles.</p> <p>Hipkiss also dislikes the tag of Outsider artist. He insists he's just 'an ordinary guy. I wear jeans and T-shirts. I've got a degree in geography. I draw. That's what I do.' He draws obsessively for hours on end at the table in the living room of his small rough-and-ready cottage in Kent, with the cats cavorting around him, and the television on in the background. As a child, he made models, encouraged by his father who runs the family joinery business where Hipkiss used to work. He sees no difference between what they each do for a living. He has strong views about 'outsiderness' and thinks there are few real outsiders at work today. 'People making environments, using shells and stuff, or living in institutions where they don't know about the world, come closest to real outsiders. They'll be discovered when they die. I'm definitely not an outsider, I'm in the world,' he says.</p> <p>John Maizels, editor of the glossy magazine Raw Vision, and author of the lavishly illustrated book, Raw Creation has a unique international overview of Outsider Art. The magazines reports on all kinds of beautiful and terrifying sculptures, doodles created on scraps of old cornflakes packets, recycled canvases built from bits of timber, stone, shells, and junk - work from countries as diverse as Croatia, Italy, Slovakia, Moscow, Japan, the United States, and Britain. Raw Vision is based in Maizels's incongruously quaint Hertfordshire cottage, which doubles as a gallery. The deceptively quiet former art teacher has a punkish delight in the art which now rules his life. For him, Outsider artists are 'people who are completely out of it, automatic. They never make changes or mistakes, don't take the pencil off the paper until it's finished. It just flows from the subconscious.' His house is filled with the stuff.</p> <p>Albert Louden and Chris Hipkiss feature in Maizels's collection. As does the work of Damian and Delaine LeBas. Some artists, like Hipkiss, resent the label Outsider, but Damian LeBas, who comes from a line of tinker families based around Sheffield, has always felt like an outsider. The fact that both he and his wife went to art school - they studied fashion and textiles - would appear to disqualify them from the Outsider clan, but their art was never consistent with college rules. Today, Damian and Delaine who comes from a large south-coast Roma-gypsy family are the glamorous couple on the Outsider network, but their everyday life brings them abuse and insults for the way they look and live. Their home in Worthing is filled with gnomes and Elvis memorabilia, Damian's obsessive football collections and crazy paintings and Delaine's gypsy art and fabric collection.</p> <p>Damian LeBas made waves during his time at the Royal College of Art, where he would draw the tattoos on builders' arms rather than classic designs on Greek ceramics during museum outings, and embroider denim jackets with sequinned abstract designs while other students created curtain fabrics. Drawing was an early escape route from a disturbed childhood, 'I started drawing football crowds when I was six,' he remembers. 'I was fascinated by the patterns and colours,' he says. Cats are a lifelong obsession. Some years ago, he produced dozens of cat paintings with acid-hell Catherine-wheel eyes, drawn with clashing bright pencils and oil pastels. 'I did about 10 a day,' he recalls, 'so many, I thought I was turning into a cat, because I'm so hairy. I got very paranoid.'</p> <p>Delaine LeBas could have been many things in life - fashion model, designer, artist. Her startling beauty and highly personal dress style has some of the kitsch beauty of the fairground. An early work called Me and my husband shows Delaine in a yellow, rose-covered jacket and flouncing tiered skirt, and Damian in soul boy's baggies and braces. They are standing in front of a caravan window and framed by floral designs which look like embroidery. Her gypsy background informs everything she does. 'My mum and dad always dressed me in strange, bizarre things - two-tone shoes, coats covered in tapestry, fancy things. But I'm glad for it. I'm an eternal child. I never make plans or drawings, it is all spontaneous.'</p> <p>Being an Outsider is not something Delaine considers relevant in her work. 'The art world is incredibly conservative. It's difficult for me to work in it because of what I am and where I come from, what I look like. I thought it was supposed to be about interesting people, fantastic things, but they ignore people like me.' For Delaine LeBas, the Outsider world is like family, just a collection of eccentric people ploughing their own route through life, and having fun on the way.</p> <p>Alex 'Perifimou' Georgiou also lives in Worthing and is a great friend of Damian and Delain LeBas. The 84-year-old Greek-Cypriot plays bingo once a week with his neighbours, drinks freshly made Greek coffee and is always on the lookout for a new lady friend. His flat is comfortable and homely, and filled with souvenirs from Cyprus. But there are also some small, brilliantly coloured paintings of cartwheeling animals and odd human figures - all painted at the dining table in this same room.</p> <p>Perifimou's early years, in a poor village just outside the Cyprus capital of Nikosia, were wretched, and he moved to London in 1935. He shifted between various jobs and then landed at the Royal Academy as a warder and later moved to the Tate Gallery. He sat among all the great paintings of the Western world, but only those of William Blake stirred him. He started drawing at the age of 59, discreetly making visual notes on small pieces of paper as he sat in his warden's chair, transforming them into small paintings later.</p> <p>Perifimou's forte is colour. He uses bright primaries blocked out into solid shapes and broken into scaly or feathery detail. Mythical, uncreated animals and acrobatic humans are his typical characters, the men with grinning expressions and whorled eyeballs. His neighbour, Damian LeBas explains Perifimou's art in terms of his Greek background: 'He was brought up thinking Ulysses was real. He says the stories are Greek dreams and all his own paintings are about Greek mythology.' Perifimou is far less analytical and simply shrugs with the now familiar response, that he loves to draw.</p> <p>There are some critics who believe that it's almost impossible to find genuine Outsider artists in Britain today. Either they have been trained in some way like Damian and Delaine LeBas, or they become successful and automatically gain entrance into the mainstream art world.</p> <p>An instinct for selling his work, for instance, has meant that Albert Louden has been 'excommunicated' from the Outsider clan. 'I had to hand my badge back,' he jokes. Prices for his work top \u00a35,000 in this country, higher in the US. Next year, an exhibition of his work is planned in Mayfair.</p> <p>Pearl Alcock, however, might be considered closer to the original definition of the word Outsider. She came to painting through necessity. When her local dress shop in Brixton, south London, failed and she was on the dole, she couldn't afford a birthday card for a friend so she painted one instead. That was back in 1985. An elderly Jamaican woman with an outgoing personality but poor health, she rarely leaves her first-floor flat. Instead, she sits in a special rocking chair and waits for the world, and what she calls her 'visions', to come to her. She sleeps a lot and has perfect recall of a rich dream world which is as real to her as waking time.</p> <p>Her sitting room is hardly a typical artist's atelier; the paints, brushes, sketch pads and paper are tidied away in the sideboard. And most surprisingly, the walls are bare. 'Everything I do has to come from my head,' Alcock explains, 'and that's why there's no pictures. I don't want them to disturb me.' I ask if a particularly vibrant landscape with heavenly-blue sky and hibiscus-red flowers were a Jamaican memory. 'I don't know,' she laughs. 'These things just come to me.'</p> <p>Pearl's paintings fit into three categories: narrative portraits, mostly without titles, although she conjures some up on the spot - 'The Africans', 'Woman and T'ief', 'Mermaid' and 'Merman'; flowers and abstracts, which create repeated patterns and reveal a tremendous intuitive sense of design. These are easily her most 'sophisticated' works in conventional terms. Birds regularly visit her visions, yellow canaries with puffed-up breasts based, elongated blue birds.</p> <p>She discusses all her works, as if seeing them for the first time. 'This bird is as big as the two boys,' she giggles at its ridiculous proportions, but adds that she really likes it. She is particularly fond of a beautiful portrait of a women with tearful eyes, painted in Tretchnikoff greens and blues. 'This woman died and when she woke up she was very sad because it's not like she thought.' But even Pearl has her collectors. George Melly lists her as a favourite artist and owns several of what she calls her 'dreams' and 'mood paintings'. Monika Kinley, one of the country's leading advocates of Outsider Art, calls her 'a visual poet'. In 2001, Pearl's work will be exhibited at the October Gallery in London.</p> <p>Will the Outsiders ever come in from the commercial cold? Jane England thinks Outsider Art should merge with the rest of the art world. 'I want to see an Outsider Room at the Tate Modern,' she says. West End dealer James Colman, who includes Scottie Wilson's works in an otherwise conventional modernist mix, thinks dealers should support young Outsider artists. 'It's bloomed in the US and the rest of Europe,' he says, 'but here it's still a gamble. It's up to us.' Perhaps the final word should go to Albert Louden, the ex-Marxist. 'It's all about market forces,' he says. 'I sometimes wonder if it's got anything to do with content. The young artists and the galleries are all a social network. Outsiders will never be in on that.'</p> <p>\u0095 Chris Hipkiss - Visionary Drawings is at England &amp; Co, 216 Westbourne Grove, London W11 (020 7221 0417) until 4 November</p> <p>Outsider websites: <a href=\"http://www.rawvision.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.rawvision.com</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.outsiderart.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.outsiderart.co.uk</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.abam.org\" target=\"_NEW\">www.abam.org</a></p>",

Louden calls them his 'internal landscapes' and says he has no idea where they come from or what they mean. 'I think they're odd,' he says, 'but not depressing. I've destroyed sackfuls of them in the past because they came out vicious or nasty.' Louden is unhappy about the label 'Outsider' which originally launched him on the art scene. Thirty years after his work was first exhibited, he feels the term ghettoises him. The Outsider Art concept can be traced back to the 1930s and the paintings done by patients in a number of Swiss mental asylums. The French painter Jean Dubuffet called the work Art Brut (Raw Art). In turn, art historian Roger Cardinal coined the term 'Outsider Art'. Picasso and Klee were amongst the early artists drawn to the genre, inspired by their shared fascination with psychoanalysis. Because most Outsider artists steer clear of the art world and of each other's work, and have no theoretical basis or analysis for it, there is little chance of a 'movement'. They tend to work like techno producers and computer nerds, tucked away in a timeless vacuum at home; sometimes only discovered after they die. They just get on with it and are often amused and surprised that anyone will sell or buy their outpourings. Today's artists have little in common with 1930s mental asylum patients, but they do share a lack of art training and no motivation to paint-to-sell. Without exception, they have to paint or draw. Louden works for seven hours most days when he is not globe-trotting with his paintings. Articulate and self-educated, he was a Marxist activist in east London's labour disputes of the 60s and 70s. He used to store his huge canvases in his garden shed, but they rotted and he had to throw them out. These days, he sells paintings in New York and was recently invited to show in Quito, Peru, at the Mexican Cultural Centre. 'I sold some paintings, too! ' he laughs shyly, hand over mouth. 'The German ambassador bought one.' Louden's work appears in London galleries beyond the tiny Outsider circuit; he plans a 2001 exhibition in Mayfair. Louden paints in the front bedroom where weights and a fitness machine share space with yet more paintings. This is where his latest work can be found. Even though the curtains are drawn, the colour on four huge canvases pours like sunlight through cathedral windows. Clotted oils shift from one rich colour to another. But where are his Louden people? 'I've been experimenting,' he smiles. 'I always experimented, even at the beginning, abstracts as well as figures.' He reveals a mildewed scrapbook containing blurry, 20-year-old prints. Some look like Turner landscapes. 'I'd been arguing for a long time with my work, in isolation, but never came to terms with it,' he says. The British market for Outsider Art was first championed by the late Victor Musgrave, a leading light on the 60s art scene. He promoted the work of Britain's best known Outsider artist Scottie Wilson. Wilson, who died in 1972, was a self-taught, working-class man who specialised in intricate ink-coloured drawings of strange flippered creatures and trees filled with mythic creatures. It wasn't long before other collectors became interested. Henry Boxer started collecting visionary and mystical works in the 60s: 'These outsiders and psychotics appealed to me because they were doing things without any drugs at the time when we were using LSD and mescaline to get to the same place,' he recalls. George Melly has been a collector of Outsider Art for more than 30 years. For him, it fulfils a lot of what surrealism achieved. 'You lower a bucket into the mind, pull it up and examine it,' he states with relish. 'It's the lack of consciousness and self-consciousness that I like. Artists today are so self-conscious, they consider the market first, whereas for Outsiders, the thing exists of itself and they do it because they have to - whether it will sell or not. Art should be magical, and these are magical, compulsive things.' These days, the London art map is being re-written by a handful of maverick dealers who are specialising in this awkward genre of Outsider Art. They are viewed by the majority of dealers with almost as much suspicion as the artists they represent. The problem is that they promote work which lacks the very commodity which keeps the Hoxton-Saatchi scene alive: a concept. Instead, Outsider Art combines a contemporary edginess with irrepressible exuberance and frequently reveals a sophisticated design sense reminiscent of the tribal artists working in Africa and Australia. A new landmark in Outsider and Marginal art is the England &amp; Co Gallery, located in the golden retail mile of Westbourne Grove, between Agn\u00e8s b clothes and Tom Conran foodstuffs. Jane England is attracting buyers who include 'art' on their shopping lists. England is fiercely protective of the artists she exhibits, and yet she also wants to bring them to a wider audience: 'They shouldn't be treated like mushrooms and kept under a stone,' she says sternly. 'They're not freaks!' England's current exhibition is a collection of strange, perverse pencil drawings by a Kent geography graduate called Chris Hipkiss. Stand close enough to them and visitors disappear into intricate, alien landscapes, fields and city streets. Intriguing from a distance, close to they divulge some startling secrets: rows of women hanging upside down compose a hedge, strapping dominatrixes driving bobsleighs made from mutant trees, fields of corn cobs numbered like soldiers in a drill parade or mutated into missiles. Hipkiss also dislikes the tag of Outsider artist. He insists he's just 'an ordinary guy. I wear jeans and T-shirts. I've got a degree in geography. I draw. That's what I do.' He draws obsessively for hours on end at the table in the living room of his small rough-and-ready cottage in Kent, with the cats cavorting around him, and the television on in the background. As a child, he made models, encouraged by his father who runs the family joinery business where Hipkiss used to work. He sees no difference between what they each do for a living. He has strong views about 'outsiderness' and thinks there are few real outsiders at work today. 'People making environments, using shells and stuff, or living in institutions where they don't know about the world, come closest to real outsiders. They'll be discovered when they die. I'm definitely not an outsider, I'm in the world,' he says. John Maizels, editor of the glossy magazine Raw Vision, and author of the lavishly illustrated book, Raw Creation has a unique international overview of Outsider Art. The magazines reports on all kinds of beautiful and terrifying sculptures, doodles created on scraps of old cornflakes packets, recycled canvases built from bits of timber, stone, shells, and junk - work from countries as diverse as Croatia, Italy, Slovakia, Moscow, Japan, the United States, and Britain. Raw Vision is based in Maizels's incongruously quaint Hertfordshire cottage, which doubles as a gallery. The deceptively quiet former art teacher has a punkish delight in the art which now rules his life. For him, Outsider artists are 'people who are completely out of it, automatic. They never make changes or mistakes, don't take the pencil off the paper until it's finished. It just flows from the subconscious.' His house is filled with the stuff. Albert Louden and Chris Hipkiss feature in Maizels's collection. As does the work of Damian and Delaine LeBas. Some artists, like Hipkiss, resent the label Outsider, but Damian LeBas, who comes from a line of tinker families based around Sheffield, has always felt like an outsider. The fact that both he and his wife went to art school - they studied fashion and textiles - would appear to disqualify them from the Outsider clan, but their art was never consistent with college rules. Today, Damian and Delaine who comes from a large south-coast Roma-gypsy family are the glamorous couple on the Outsider network, but their everyday life brings them abuse and insults for the way they look and live. Their home in Worthing is filled with gnomes and Elvis memorabilia, Damian's obsessive football collections and crazy paintings and Delaine's gypsy art and fabric collection. Damian LeBas made waves during his time at the Royal College of Art, where he would draw the tattoos on builders' arms rather than classic designs on Greek ceramics during museum outings, and embroider denim jackets with sequinned abstract designs while other students created curtain fabrics. Drawing was an early escape route from a disturbed childhood, 'I started drawing football crowds when I was six,' he remembers. 'I was fascinated by the patterns and colours,' he says. Cats are a lifelong obsession. Some years ago, he produced dozens of cat paintings with acid-hell Catherine-wheel eyes, drawn with clashing bright pencils and oil pastels. 'I did about 10 a day,' he recalls, 'so many, I thought I was turning into a cat, because I'm so hairy. I got very paranoid.' Delaine LeBas could have been many things in life - fashion model, designer, artist. Her startling beauty and highly personal dress style has some of the kitsch beauty of the fairground. An early work called Me and my husband shows Delaine in a yellow, rose-covered jacket and flouncing tiered skirt, and Damian in soul boy's baggies and braces. They are standing in front of a caravan window and framed by floral designs which look like embroidery. Her gypsy background informs everything she does. 'My mum and dad always dressed me in strange, bizarre things - two-tone shoes, coats covered in tapestry, fancy things. But I'm glad for it. I'm an eternal child. I never make plans or drawings, it is all spontaneous.' Being an Outsider is not something Delaine considers relevant in her work. 'The art world is incredibly conservative. It's difficult for me to work in it because of what I am and where I come from, what I look like. I thought it was supposed to be about interesting people, fantastic things, but they ignore people like me.' For Delaine LeBas, the Outsider world is like family, just a collection of eccentric people ploughing their own route through life, and having fun on the way. Alex 'Perifimou' Georgiou also lives in Worthing and is a great friend of Damian and Delain LeBas. The 84-year-old Greek-Cypriot plays bingo once a week with his neighbours, drinks freshly made Greek coffee and is always on the lookout for a new lady friend. His flat is comfortable and homely, and filled with souvenirs from Cyprus. But there are also some small, brilliantly coloured paintings of cartwheeling animals and odd human figures - all painted at the dining table in this same room. Perifimou's early years, in a poor village just outside the Cyprus capital of Nikosia, were wretched, and he moved to London in 1935. He shifted between various jobs and then landed at the Royal Academy as a warder and later moved to the Tate Gallery. He sat among all the great paintings of the Western world, but only those of William Blake stirred him. He started drawing at the age of 59, discreetly making visual notes on small pieces of paper as he sat in his warden's chair, transforming them into small paintings later. Perifimou's forte is colour. He uses bright primaries blocked out into solid shapes and broken into scaly or feathery detail. Mythical, uncreated animals and acrobatic humans are his typical characters, the men with grinning expressions and whorled eyeballs. His neighbour, Damian LeBas explains Perifimou's art in terms of his Greek background: 'He was brought up thinking Ulysses was real. He says the stories are Greek dreams and all his own paintings are about Greek mythology.' Perifimou is far less analytical and simply shrugs with the now familiar response, that he loves to draw. There are some critics who believe that it's almost impossible to find genuine Outsider artists in Britain today. Either they have been trained in some way like Damian and Delaine LeBas, or they become successful and automatically gain entrance into the mainstream art world. An instinct for selling his work, for instance, has meant that Albert Louden has been 'excommunicated' from the Outsider clan. 'I had to hand my badge back,' he jokes. Prices for his work top \u00a35,000 in this country, higher in the US. Next year, an exhibition of his work is planned in Mayfair. Pearl Alcock, however, might be considered closer to the original definition of the word Outsider. She came to painting through necessity. When her local dress shop in Brixton, south London, failed and she was on the dole, she couldn't afford a birthday card for a friend so she painted one instead. That was back in 1985. An elderly Jamaican woman with an outgoing personality but poor health, she rarely leaves her first-floor flat. Instead, she sits in a special rocking chair and waits for the world, and what she calls her 'visions', to come to her. She sleeps a lot and has perfect recall of a rich dream world which is as real to her as waking time. Her sitting room is hardly a typical artist's atelier; the paints, brushes, sketch pads and paper are tidied away in the sideboard. And most surprisingly, the walls are bare. 'Everything I do has to come from my head,' Alcock explains, 'and that's why there's no pictures. I don't want them to disturb me.' I ask if a particularly vibrant landscape with heavenly-blue sky and hibiscus-red flowers were a Jamaican memory. 'I don't know,' she laughs. 'These things just come to me.' Pearl's paintings fit into three categories: narrative portraits, mostly without titles, although she conjures some up on the spot - 'The Africans', 'Woman and T'ief', 'Mermaid' and 'Merman'; flowers and abstracts, which create repeated patterns and reveal a tremendous intuitive sense of design. These are easily her most 'sophisticated' works in conventional terms. Birds regularly visit her visions, yellow canaries with puffed-up breasts based, elongated blue birds. She discusses all her works, as if seeing them for the first time. 'This bird is as big as the two boys,' she giggles at its ridiculous proportions, but adds that she really likes it. She is particularly fond of a beautiful portrait of a women with tearful eyes, painted in Tretchnikoff greens and blues. 'This woman died and when she woke up she was very sad because it's not like she thought.' But even Pearl has her collectors. George Melly lists her as a favourite artist and owns several of what she calls her 'dreams' and 'mood paintings'. Monika Kinley, one of the country's leading advocates of Outsider Art, calls her 'a visual poet'. In 2001, Pearl's work will be exhibited at the October Gallery in London. Will the Outsiders ever come in from the commercial cold? Jane England thinks Outsider Art should merge with the rest of the art world. 'I want to see an Outsider Room at the Tate Modern,' she says. West End dealer James Colman, who includes Scottie Wilson's works in an otherwise conventional modernist mix, thinks dealers should support young Outsider artists. 'It's bloomed in the US and the rest of Europe,' he says, 'but here it's still a gamble. It's up to us.' Perhaps the final word should go to Albert Louden, the ex-Marxist. 'It's all about market forces,' he says. 'I sometimes wonder if it's got anything to do with content. The young artists and the galleries are all a social network. Outsiders will never be in on that.' \u0095 Chris Hipkiss - Visionary Drawings is at England &amp; Co, 216 Westbourne Grove, London W11 (020 7221 0417) until 4 November Outsider websites: www.rawvision.com www.outsiderart.co.uk www.abam.org",

      "body": "<p>Michael is the godfather of my six-year-old daughter. When she was a few months old, he was one of the few people we trusted to be able to care for her. We would go out to the cinema or for a quick meal and he would be completely unfazed by her evening sessions of colicky crying, singing to her so that she was always fast asleep when we arrived home. Since then, he has often looked after both our children, acting as a child minder when I had to work, or as a wonderful baby-sitter in the evenings.</p> <p>So I was surprised to learn from Michael that his sister-in-law wouldn't agree with me. She considers him incapable of caring for children and she has forbidden him from looking after or taking his nephew out alone. Not because of any suspected deviancy or substance dependency, you understand, but because he has a epilepsy.</p> <p>The term epilepsy covers the many different types of seizure that are caused by a temporary state of abnormal activity within differing parts of the brain. It is important to note the word 'temporary', because epilepsy is not considered to be an illness or a disease any more than, say, a migraine. Though to be diagnosed as having epilepsy (the tendency to suffer repeated seizures) has a more profound impact on a person's life than a migraine. This is not only illustrated by Michael's sister-in-law's fears but by my willingness to ignore his epilepsy because most of the time he seems to.</p> <p>Although I have never witnessed Michael having a seizure in the 10 years I've known him, I have seen him afterwards with a bruised and bloody face and a painful, swollen tongue that can make it difficult to eat or sleep. Michael is not a whinger, and like most people with epilepsy does not want to be defined by his condition (he does not like being called 'an epileptic'). But when he told me about his sister-in-law's alarmist attitude, I couldn't help wondering if I hadn't perhaps been too relaxed - it crossed my mind that the unpredictability of epilepsy and the fact that it is often alarming to witness should have put me off asking Michael to care for my kids. I decided I needed to know more.</p> <p>Epilepsy is a neurological condition. The brain has tens of millions of neurones, each connected to about 6,000 other neurones. When the brain is functioning normally, thousands of neurones fire (that is, give out a burst of electrical energy), transmitting information from cell to cell. Their activity is usually well organised, but sometimes - and this is what happens with epilepsy - the brain becomes too excitable and this super-excitability leads to areas going out of control, with many cells firing together.</p> <p>These bursts of abnormal firing activity can last from seconds to minutes, and then the brain returns to its normal functioning state. While the discharge lasts, it causes a temporary change in our emotions, consciousness, intellect or behaviour, which is known as a seizure or 'fit', although the term 'fit' is now rarely used by people with epilepsy because it is seen to have negative connotations with uncontrollable anger, as in 'don't tell them or they will have a fit'.</p> <p>Anyone might have a seizure, and in fact one in 20 people will have a major one during their life, but two thirds of those who have a single seizure will never have another one. Seizures can be the result of disease, injury, birth trauma, brain infection (such as meningitis or encephalitis), brain tumour, stroke, as well as drug or alcohol abuse and withdrawal. A tendency to seizures may develop for no obvious reason, though, or there may possibly be an inherited predisposition.</p> <p>The clinical diagnosis is made by a neurologist on the basis of the patient having more than one epileptic seizure (an accurate eyewitness account is often asked for). An EEG (electroencephalogram) is a special test that records brain waves and can provide useful information, particularly about types of seizure. CT and MRI brain scans can assess if there is an underlying cause or damage to the brain itself.</p> <p>Michael has been diagnosed as having 'tonic clonic' seizures ('I know it sounds like something I used to drink in Soho,' he says, 'but that is what they tell me'), or what used to be called 'grand mal'. This kind of seizure is probably what most people imagine when they think of epilepsy, although there are many different types and syndromes. First, he falls to the ground unconscious and his arms and legs go straight and rigid, his mouth clenches tight and the whole body is stiff. Then the muscles start to jerk in unison, starting at a rate of once every four to six seconds, and then stopping after a matter of minutes.</p> <p>Michael comes to some time later with no memory of what has happened, and if the seizure has occurred outside his home, he often finds himself either with a crowd around him or in an ambulance. If he is alone, he is not always aware that he has had a seizure. 'Recently, I went to buy some milk from the newsagent's,' he says. 'And wondered why the man behind the counter was looking at me in such a horrified way. When I got home, I looked in the mirror and saw that I had cut my head and had blood dripping down my face. Afterwards, there is a terrible pressure in my head and I have often bitten my tongue. I feel battered.'</p> <p>Dostoevsky wrote of the aftermath of his own epilepsy: 'After every attack, I cannot collect my thoughts for four days_ my memory seems to have gone.' It was not only his memory that suffered after each attack, but he was also overwhelmed by 'a feeling of terrible guilt', just as if he had committed 'some dreadful crime'. Michael says that he does not suffer from guilt, but rather humiliation and shame. Dostoevsky wrote, too, of a sense of euphoria before a seizure, which others describe as an 'aura'. Michael never used to have this but does now describe the sensation of 'slowing down; an odd sucking-out of sensation and a deadly calmness'.</p> <p>Michael suffered a frontal lobe injury in a car accident when he was 10. Ten years later, he had his first fit and in the last 20 years he has tried eight different types of anti-epileptic drugs to control and reduce his seizures. (No drug, however, can guarantee you will never have another fit.)</p> <p>One of the things Michael most loathes about epilepsy is the side effects of the drugs that he has to take twice daily because 'there is a dulling of the senses and a terrible sluggishness'. Professor John Duncan, medical director of the National Society for Epilepsy and professor of neurology at University College London, agrees: 'For some people with epilepsy, the side effects can include having the edge taken off concentration and a pervasive tiredness. For those who are having seizures at a rate of, say, once a year, it might be worth carefully considering lowering the dose of anti-epileptic drugs, even if it means more frequent seizures. For some, it might be worth the trade-off.'</p> <p>I know that Michael has got fed up with the effects of the drugs before, but has then been taken aback by the intensity of the seizures when he has tried to ease off them. He is now convinced of the necessity of taking them regularly. 'For years, I used all sorts of euphemistic terms such as \"my blackouts\", which was a sort of denial. Even now, I tend to overcompensate by being as lively and enthusiastic as I can but, of course, the thought that you might have a seizure at any time and without any real warning is pretty incapacitating. You can feel marginalised, and because it is a brain thing, I know that it has certainly affected my personal relationships. Epilepsy is considered to be mysterious and terrifying by an awful lot of people.'</p> <p>For a very few people with epilepsy (about 1,000 a year), the seemingly drastic measure of surgery is taken. If seizures begin on one side of the brain, occur frequently and can not be brought under control with two or, at most, three anti- epileptic drugs, or if there is shown to be a single abnormality in just one region of the brain, surgery can be seen as a 'cure'.</p> <p>Meanwhile, I will be lucky to book Michael in for baby-sitting at the moment. Two of my friends have asked if he would consider looking after their young children, because they have seen how great he is with mine. Like me, they know how hard it is to find someone as reliable, trustworthy and easy-going as Michael and feel that ultimately it is his sister- in-law's loss. Still, I am glad to have discovered more about such a close friend's condition - in the unlikely event that I will be with him during a seizure, I will at least have a greater understanding of what is going on.</p> <p><b> Helping hands: What to do if someone has a seizure</b></p> <p>Most epileptic fits demand no action on the part of the bystander. Even a tonic clonic convulsion is not a medical emergency, although it is frightening to watch, especially if you have never seen one before. Don't try to restrain the movements of the person having the seizure. You may need to move them gently, if they are in immediate danger (near an open fire or water). Otherwise, simply move any pieces of furniture so that there is a clear space around them, or put padding round any immovable objects that might cause injury.</p> <p>Never try to force the person's mouth open or wedge anything between their teeth.

Once the violent movements of the convulsion have stopped, gently turn the person on to their side into the recovery position, so that their breathing will not be obstructed while they are unconscious. Let the person wake up naturally, if they are sleeping. If the convulsions last for more than five minutes, or if another fit begins immediately, call for an ambulance telling them that the person is in status epilepticus.This is an emergency situation, so make sure that the person's airway is clear, put them in the recovery position, if this is possible, and stay with the person until the ambulance arrives.</p> <p><b>More information</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.epilepsy.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">British Epilepsy Association</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.epilepsynse.org.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">National Society for Epilepsy</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Michael is the godfather of my six-year-old daughter. When she was a few months old, he was one of the few people we trusted to be able to care for her. We would go out to the cinema or for a quick meal and he would be completely unfazed by her evening sessions of colicky crying, singing to her so that she was always fast asleep when we arrived home. Since then, he has often looked after both our children, acting as a child minder when I had to work, or as a wonderful baby-sitter in the evenings. So I was surprised to learn from Michael that his sister-in-law wouldn't agree with me. She considers him incapable of caring for children and she has forbidden him from looking after or taking his nephew out alone. Not because of any suspected deviancy or substance dependency, you understand, but because he has a epilepsy. The term epilepsy covers the many different types of seizure that are caused by a temporary state of abnormal activity within differing parts of the brain. It is important to note the word 'temporary', because epilepsy is not considered to be an illness or a disease any more than, say, a migraine. Though to be diagnosed as having epilepsy (the tendency to suffer repeated seizures) has a more profound impact on a person's life than a migraine.

      "body": "<p>Each night in Monte Carlo, it is said, a recording of predatory birds is transmitted through hidden loudspeakers in the main square to prevent sparrows from soiling the famous casino's pristine lawn. And each morning a platoon of gardeners removes dying petals from the immaculate flowerbeds. Amid such stainless perfection, a prison could look embarrassingly conspicuous. The authorities in the world's wealthiest state have dealt with the problem by locating the local jail on the very extremity of its tiny landmass. Of the thousands of tour- ists who file past the old fort on the rocky promontory of Monaco Ville, between the Oceanographic Museum and a cheesy celebration of the Grimaldi family called the Monte Carlo Story, very few realise that incarcerated within its walls are the principality's 20 or so prisoners. There are no signboards nor, indeed, any apparent entrance. The only clues to its true purpose are the bars on the windows and the battery of security cameras on the roof - hardly an atypical sight in Monaco. </p> <p>Among the inmates, most of whom are imprisoned for fraud or other white-collar crime, is Ted Maher, a 42-year-old former Green Beret in the US Army. Last December, Maher was arrested following the deaths of billionaire banker Edmond Safra and his nurse in circumstances that remain oblique and subject to a multitude of speculative theories. Initially, Maher was not a suspect. Those who were, suggested one newspaper, 'range from the Russian mafia to Japanese investors, through drug cartels and Middle Eastern trading companies'. It seemed that Safra, 67, who was renowned for his protective shield of Israeli bodyguards, was a man with no shortage of enemies. And, equally, Maher, a smalltown American who never travelled beyond US borders in his three years in the army, appeared to be someone who was a total stranger to both drug cartels and the Moscow mafia. </p> <p>How he came to be in Monaco was a result of unforeseeable happenstance. Working at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, where he had qualified as a licensed nurse, Maher found an expensive camera which he promptly returned to its owner. The photographer mentioned the story to an associate, Safra, who was sufficiently impressed to offer Maher a position as part of his 12-strong medical team - the banker suffered from Parkinson's Disease. </p> <p>The unworldly Maher spoke not a word of French. Safra, a Lebanese Jew with Brazilian nationality who lived mostly in the south of France, was fluent in French, English, Italian, Portuguese, Arabic and Hebrew. Maher was a tall, slender man with an open manner. Safra was short and bald and enigmatic. Maher had an ongoing property dispute with his next-door neighbour in upper New York State. Safra owned a vast penthouse in Monaco and La Leopolda, the magnificent villa in Villefranche built on the estate that once belonged to Belgium's genocidal King Leopold II. He also possessed homes in Paris, Geneva, London, New York and Brazil. </p> <p>In any other circumstances, the closest Maher might have come to Safra would have been to cash a cheque in one of his banks. But, as it was, Maher left his wife and three children in Stormville, New York, and his secure post at Columbia-Presbyterian, and flew to the French Riviera and a $600-a-day ringside view of the life of one of the world's richest and most mysterious men. </p> <p> As far back as 1957, Edmond Safra was named as a drug trafficker in a US Bureau of Narcotics report. The accusation was later withdrawn, but until his death Safra was the inspiration for countless unsubstantiated rumours that linked him to drug, gold and currency trafficking, money laundering and organised crime. </p> <p>The Safra family came from the Halabi merchants of northern Lebanon, a close-knit clan of Sephardic Jewish traders who historically made their money from financing the camel caravans of the Middle East. Edmond's father Jacob opened the family bank in 1920, building on the Safras' long experience in gold and currency exchange. Sephardic tradition maintained that the family business should be passed on to the oldest son. But such was his precocious interest in banking that the young Edmond leapfrogged his elder brother, Elie, to be selected by his father as the prime heir. At just 16, Edmond went to Milan to learn the banking business and then on to Brazil, where he set up his first bank at the age of 21. </p> <p>In contrast to most banks, Safra's was built on deposits rather than loans. It may be this strategy that originally led some observers to view Safra's banks as attractive propositions for money launderers. Five years ago, New York magazine ran an investigation into Safra's Republic National Bank in which it claimed that the bank 'quickly became known on the street as a bank that would send an armoured car to pick up large sums from its more secretive customers'. </p> <p>In the 80s, Safra and Republic were the targets of a global whispering campaign. Among the allegations that surfaced in a variety of mostly obscure publications was the suggestion that he was involved in the Iran-Contra affair; that he arranged the murder of a security specialist who had supposedly discovered a link between him and the arms-for-hostages scandal; that he had double-crossed the Medellin cocaine cartel; that he was a confr\u00e8re of mafia legend Mayer Lansky; and that Republic had laundered the drug-trafficking profits of Panama's General Noriega. </p> <p>Only the last claim had any basis in established fact, and Republic was only one of a number of banks that held Noriega's funds. Eventually, Safra proved in court that the rumours emanated from his corporate rivals, American Express, which had bought Republic's Swiss parent company, TDB, in an acrimonious deal in 1983 (Safra regained control in 1988). American Express was forced to apologise and donate $8m to a number of charities, including the Anti-Defamation League. For many people in and around the world of banking, however, Safra's legal victory served only to increase their suspicions of the secretive Lebanese businessman. In New York and London it was customary to grin in a knowing fashion whenever Safra's name was mentioned. Now the grins were that much wider. </p> <p>Bryan Burrough ascribed the slurs aimed at Safra to anti-Semitism in his book Vendetta: American Express and the Smearing of Edmond Safra . But if anti-Semitism alone was the reason for the stories, then why was Safra singled out and not the innumerable other Jewish bankers operating in high finance? It would be rather as if Michael Jordan had been selected for racist abuse on account of being a black player in basketball. Whatever the true explanation for the attacks, Safra was acutely sensitive to their effect on his good name. He was determined to sue any publication, however small, that repeated the libels. </p> <p>While American Express was waging its smear campaign, American customs officers were investigating Safra's banks for laundering Colombian drug funds. No charges were brought. Yet when the news emerged that Safra was dead, the prime suspects were not embittered former American Express executives or Colombian drug lords, but the Russian mafia, or mafiya . </p> <p>Three factors pointed in its direction. First, Republic's dealings with Russia were well documented. Under licence from the US government, Republic shipped around $10bn of US currency a year to Russian banks. Although perfectly legal, the shipments caused no little consternation among some state agencies. The problem was that many banks in Russia, and up to 50 that Republic was trading currency with, were suspected of being at the very least unreliable and quite possibly fronts for the mafiya. Referring to this apparent criminalisation of cash, a source from the Criminal Investi gation Bureau of New York State Banking Department told New York magazine: 'To us it was like a sore on Cindy Crawford's face.' </p> <p>Second, at the time of his death, Safra was engaged in the protracted and problematic sale of Republic to HSBC. There were various hold-ups, but one of them was said to be the Russian accounts that were frozen as a result of Federal investigation into money laundering, which Republic itself prompted by alerting the authorities to its concerns. Observers speedily concluded that a short-changed mafiya chief had sought revenge. Some 90 or so bankers have been killed in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union. 'What you have to understand,' Stephen Handelman, an expert on the mafiya and author of Comrade Criminal , told me, 'is that bankers are different in Russia. Over 2,000 banks were set up after 1989, most of which have since collapsed, and many of the people behind them had emerged from the black market and criminal backgrounds. So often when a banker is killed he may himself be involved in the mafiya.' </p> <p>And third, the French Riviera, which enjoys a rich history of Russian influence dating back to 19th-century aristocrats, had seen a sudden and ostentatious influx of newly wealthy Russians. Tales of Moscow businessmen buying yachts and property for cash formed the gossip of sales people from Cannes up to Menton, who, while often offended, seldom refused the money. In Nice, the mafiya was said to have bought into the exclusive Marina Baie des Anges, where the head of one Russian crime gang was arrested with false papers and fled to Monaco. In the past three years, Monaco has itself expelled 15 Russians suspected of illegal business practices, including a former KGB colonel. And some lawyers say that Monaco has now adopted an unofficial policy of refusing entry to all Russians. </p> <p>Arnaud Montauibourg, a French MP who led a parliamentary investigation into the mafiya, thinks the mafiya has already 'penetrated Monaco', laundering money 'through real estate, the casino and through trusts'. Sitting outside the Caf\u00e9 de Paris in Monte Carlo on a soft autumn evening earlier this month, watching the hopefuls making their way to the casino, it was not hard to spot the Russian businessmen. They have little apparent fear of cultural stereotyping. Thus two men with gold bracelets and neck chains sat drinking vodka and smoking weighty cigars, largely ignoring their two women companions whose compliant demeanour, polite laughter and visible stocking garters made it plain that they were part of the night's entertainment bill. </p> <p>It's this kind of egregious behaviour that has placed the Russians, whether legitimate business people or not, at the centre of a near moral panic hereabouts. The Russians are coming, is the anxious chorus on the Cte d'Azur, and everyone assumed they had come for Safra. </p> <p> At 5am on the morning of 3 December last </p> <p> year, Ted Maher awoke his boss with news that two masked men had broken into the belle \u00e9poque building at 17 Avenue D'Ostende in Monaco. Maher was bleeding from three stab wounds. Although a former Green Beret, Maher had served as a medical auxiliary. He had no more experience of combat than he did of high-style living. He was there to tend his employer, not protect him. For that, Safra had his Israeli army bodyguards. But not in Monaco. So safe did he feel in his penthouse next to the renowned Hotel Hermitage, that he maintained the security team at La Leopolda, 10 miles away. </p> <p>It was there during the 80s that Safra, under the guidance of his Brazilian socialite wife, held celebrity-enriched parties of daunting splendour. Lily, whom Safra married in 1976, had three children from a previous marriage and was independently a very rich woman. Nevertheless, the prenuptial agreement she signed was said to have run to 600 pages. It was she who ensured that names such as Aristotle Onassis and Frank Sinatra were included on the Safras' guest list. John Fairchild, the arbiter of American high-society standing, was moved to speak of the couple's 'meteoric rise to social power'. </p> <p>But social acceptance had not lessened Safra's near-phobic paranoia. He always carried blue gemstones to ward off the evil eye, and retained an abiding fear of curses. He was deeply superstitious about the number five and was terrified of being kidnapped. So he must have been deeply scared early that morning when he learned from Maher that the state-of-the-art security system in the building, which also housed three banks, had been breached. Immediately, Safra retreated with another of his nurses, 52-year-old Viviane Torrente, to his steel-reinforced bathroom. </p> <p>Within minutes a fire broke out. This is how Monaco's assistant prosecutor Catherine Le Lay described the scene: 'The apartment is immense, and within it there are two separate wings, one for Mr Safra and one for his wife. Mr Safra was in his wing, which consisted of three rooms - his bedroom, a nursing laboratory and a bathroom. With him were two nurses. The police received a call from the receptionist of the building. She had been alerted by the male nurse, who had staggered from the apartment which occupies the fifth and sixth floors, down to the ground floor. He had been injured with a knife with a six-inch blade. </p> <p>'The police arrived at the scene extremely quickly and when they arrived they were un able immediately to access the apartment, which is protected by steel-reinforced doors. When they did gain entry with the firemen, the fire had already taken hold in the flat, which was extremely difficult to bring under control. When the police were finally able to penetrate the flat, they found Mr Safra dead where he had taken refuge in the bathroom with his nurse, Viviane Torrente, who also died. </p> <p>'His wife was not even roused by the drama. It is difficult to convey just how big this flat is, but I have never seen anything like it. She was separated by a good distance from her husband and each door was reinforced. By the time the firemen had mastered the fire, smoke was only beginning to affect her wing of the flat, which would have rendered her more deeply unconscious. We still don't know how the attackers got into the flat, or how they escaped.' </p> <p>Safra and Torrente died from smoke inhalation. The fumes reached them through the fire-detection system. With its 500 officers, Monaco is probably the most intensively policed square mile anywhere on the planet - the local constabulary likes to boast that it can close down all exit routes from the principality in minutes. Its border with France is only notional, but the police always man it. Its streets and buildings are also the world's most intensively filmed. </p> <p>Very few square feet remain unrecorded by the ubiquitous security cameras. But there was no sign of the intruders. The idea that two men could break into the heavily secured home of one of the world's wealthiest men, cause his death and leave without trace did not sit well with Monaco's reputation as a crime-free zone for the super-rich. </p> <p>The police became convinced that it was an inside job. Within two days of Safra's death, Maher was arrested. And, shortly afterwards, he told police that he had stabbed himself and started a fire and that there were no intruders, masked or otherwise. His actions, he said, were an attempt to gain his boss's respect. He spoke of not getting along with the head nurse, a woman named Sonia, and how he wished to circumvent her power by demonstrating his loyalty to Safra. At a news conference, chief prosecutor Daniel Serdet quoted from Maher's police statement: 'It was my own dark ideas which led me to do this.' </p> <p>This was an extraordinary turnaround. From a story of high-financial corruption and international gangsterism, it became one of a misguided approach to job promotion. Police announced Maher's confession on 6 December, the same day that Safra was buried in Geneva. Around 1,000 mourners attended the ceremony at the Hekhal Haness synagogue, including the Nobel Peace laureate Eli Wiesel, Israel's foreign minister David Levy, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan and former United Nations secretary general, Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar. Also, on the same day, the US Federal Reserve approved the sale of Republic to HSBC Holdings, and four weeks to the day after Safra's death the $9.85bn deal was completed, netting Safra's heirs some $2.8bn. Could it really be that strange and that straightforward? </p> <p> In America, the conspiracy theorists' medium, the internet, has been hot with indignation. There is much talk of Maher's 'imprisonment as a scapegoat for Russian money- launderers' and he is referred to as 'prisoner of war'. 'Please help him,' runs one appeal, 'before he is killed by the Monaco government or the responsible parties that did commit this crime and used Ted as a scapegoat.' Much of the stuff is hysterically xenophobic, virulently right-wing and clearly the work of delusional minds. Of course, that doesn't mean that Maher isn't a fall guy. However, his defence team certainly do not see Maher as the victim of a fiendish plot. </p> <p>Georges Blot, Maher's Monegasque lawyer, has gone on record as saying that his client started the fire and stabbed himself. 'The first words Ted said to me when I met him were: \"This is horrible. I loved him. I admired him. I respected him. I don't understand why I did it.\"' </p> <p>Maher's family in the US are unimpressed. They say that the internal security videotapes, which they believe would prove Maher's innocence, have gone missing (Monaco police say the video system was not working). And Maher's wife Heidi, argues that her husband's legal defence is compromised because it is state-appointed. 'The Monaco government is paying Ted's lawyer, Mr Blot, which is clearly a conflict of interest,' she has said. In fact, that is common legal practice, and indeed a human right, in most countries on occasions when the accused cannot afford a lawyer. Yet while Monaco is not implicated in a cover-up, there is a sense that it is actively presenting an untroubled face to the world. </p> <p>This is not the first time that a banker's death has caused a scandal in the region. Back in 1990, Jean Ferry, an official of the Industrial Bank of Monaco (BIM), was found dead from a bullet wound in the head. The police decided it was suicide, but a subsequent investigation found that a client of Ferry had constructed a large-scale fraud involving BIM. It also discovered that lax practices encouraging foreign tax evasion were endemic within the Monaco banking system. The most common method exploited a law which enabled foreign investors to create 'shell' companies in the names of Monegasque citizens (for a small payment). It has often been alleged that the system is abused by organised crime. </p> <p>Roger Bianchini, a journalist with Nice-Matin , told an author of a book on the Grimaldis: 'The whole system is well known to the initiated. But when underground deals begin to surface and scandal breaks through, Prince Rainier becomes concerned that the image of the principality could be tarnished.' </p> <p>As with other wealthy climes, such as Beverly Hills, the very sheen of Monaco's surface leads the visitor to suspect some form of moral corruption lurking underneath. The old wedding-cake architecture that survives is placed in the shade by the huge apartment-block developments that Rainier green-lighted in the 60s, creating an odd combination of sickly innocence and brash confidence. Although there is a refreshing sea breeze and the streets are neurotically clean, the faintest smell of pollution hangs in the air alongside the sweet fragrance of jasmine. And there is a disturbing sense that no amount of money will wash it away. </p> <p>For all its publicity-seeking glamour, Monaco thrives on secrecy. The government and its institutions, such as the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Bains de Mer, which runs the casino and hotels and much else, and which are all essentially arms of the Grimaldi empire ruled by Prince Rainier, are unapologetically opaque. Bankers may be attracted to secrecy, but so are storytellers. One of the more fanciful ideas doing the rounds has it that the Grimaldi grip on Monaco includes extensive telephone tapping based on a word-trigger system. 'If you said something derogatory about a Grimaldi it would undoubtedly hit the trigger,' suggests one observer. </p> <p>Against this backdrop of fantasy, any explanation of events provided by Monaco, the so-called Disneyland Dictatorship, would never be seen as the whole story. And indeed there are inconsistencies. Even Safra's widow's lawyer, Marc Bonnant, was concerned to ask that all the evidence be made available. </p> <p>'We would like to have all the details of the nurse's confession. Was it credible and complete, what exactly pushed him to do what he did, how many fires did he set, are there any inconsistencies in his confession? A thousand questions come to mind which need answers to make any sense out of this tragic and absurd death.' </p> <p>Among those questions, perhaps, are why did Safra remain in the bathroom even after the police arrived and why did it take two long hours for the fire brigade to get inside the bathroom? And why is it that Maher is said to have started only one fire and yet investigators located two separate origins? </p> <p>In early official reports it was stated - unambiguously by assistant prosecutor Le Lay - that Lily Safra did not speak to her husband during his confinement in the bathroom, that she was asleep. Elsewhere there were reports that she had spoken to him on a mobile phone. Bonnant told me, 'Edward Safra spoke twice to his wife, to his bodyguard and to the police.' Then why did he not emerge from the bathroom? Bonnant says that everyone was still under the impression that two armed intruders were in the building, which is also why the fire brigade made slow progress. </p> <p>But given the police presence and his own security guard, Safra must have been paralysed with fear not to feel confident enough to come out. Who did he think was after him? Bonnant is quick to scotch any talk of assassins. 'Look, if you want to kill a man, you pay $20,000 and you get the job done the right way by a professional. The right way is not to hire a nurse to start a small fire and hope that the police take two hours to get to him.' An insider on Maher's defence team echoes this point. 'People have told me they know for sure that Safra was shot with two bullets. Now the defence is going to see the inside of the building and we've asked for further fire reports and to look at video film outside the home. It might be that we'll see two guys in balaclavas on top of the roof, but I don't think so. And you have to ask, why were there no holes in Ted's clothes where his wounds were? Did the intruders thoughtfully lift up his shirt before stabbing him?' </p> <p>Handelman also dismissed the idea that Russians were behind Safra's death. 'It just wasn't their MO. Not outside Russia. Most people thought Safra was holding IOUs or money for the mafiya, but they wouldn't have killed him for that.' But he added: 'You can always be surprised.' </p> <p> After Maher's confession was made public, people began to ask how Safra had ever come to employ a man with such evident psychological problems. Suddenly it was common knowledge that Maher had a prescription-drug problem - according to Serdet - a history of violence and unstable personality traits. His colleagues at Columbia-Presbyterian countered these stories and provided an image of a reliable and motivated worker. 'He was really on top of things,' said one paediatrician. 'In fact, he was one of the better nurses I've seen.' </p> <p>Bonnant has said that Maher was properly vetted through 'in-depth background checks', as well as being interviewed by Safra himself. 'The fact that Maher is unstable became apparent to us only after the accident. Nothing in Maher's files showed the slightest trace of mental instability.' Perhaps because it wasn't there. </p> <p>Some newspaper articles quoted a former neighbour who quarrelled with Maher. 'He was a miserable bastard,' said 70-year- old Leonard Levelle, who accused Maher of physical assault. According to Maher's defence, Levelle himself was cautioned a number of times by the police. Much was also made of Mayer's leaving the Las Vegas police force after only three months. His defence say he quit because he contracted spinal meningitis. </p> <p>So was it a bizarre aberration? 'The reality of the situation is not something Ted can articulate,' say his defence. But the same source believed Maher was under pressure because his wife wanted him to return home and he wanted to stay in Monaco. </p> <p>What even his detractors agree on is that Maher never intended to kill Safra. 'If he wanted to,' said Serdet, 'he would have had 10,000 chances a day.' The fire simply got out of hand because he started it in an acrylic wastepaper basket. However, Maher is currently charged on a count of arson leading to death, a crime which carries a maximum life sentence. </p> <p>In his Monte Carlo office, high above the Boulevard des Moulins, Donald Manasse, an American-Frenchman who is assisting Georges Blot, told me, 'Ted is not guilty of the crimes as charged and we are seeking a requalification of the charges.' </p> <p>Optimistically, he might be looking at four to six years. But that's still a very severe sentence for what basically amounts to an accident. Bonnant demonstrated the Safra family's determination to gain what they see as justice. He told me: 'We want to ensure that the one who caused this will be properly punished.' </p> <p>The trial is unlikely to come to court until early next year. The investigating judge, Patricia Richett is still conducting her inquiry. Given the profile and importance of Safra, and the sensitivity of the Monaco authorities, fears have been expressed by those close to Maher that the investigation might be partial. Manasse was certain that Richett would not succumb to external pressure from any direction. 'Anyone who would say she could be influenced by third parties,' he told me, 'has no idea who she is.' </p> <p>Maher, it seems, does have one influential supporter himself. Dominic Dunne, the celebrated Vanity Fair writer and crusader against criminal injustice, is known to be sympathetic towards his plight. And the Monegasques have taken due notice. 'When Serdet heard that Dunne was arriving in Monaco,' a legal source said, 'he was practically saying, \"We've got to get this right, Dominic Dunne is coming to town.\"' </p> <p>In the meantime, Maher, the man who wanted to gain attention, is locked up in a prison that dare not speak its name, removed from his Mediterranean idyll, but tantalisingly trapped a few feet from the sea. He has no visitors, save his lawyers and the American consulate representative, and of course the tourists passing unknowingly by on their way to see a different Monte Carlo story. </p> <p>Life in Monaco continues as ever in its own secretive way. On a brilliant morning with seagulls circling overhead and the roar of the Monaco Kart Cup ripping around the bay, I stopped outside 17 Avenue D'Ostende. The fire damage is now mostly repaired, and just to be certain, I asked a policeman where Monsieur Safra had lived. He looked at me with a thin smile and said, ' Je ne sais pas.' Then he walked away. </p> <p>After Safra's burial, Eli Wiesel said of the close friend he often called his brother: 'After all, what remains of a man after his death? It is his name, his reputation, his honour.' And, a less circumspect man might have added, his money. Already there is talk of family disputes about where it will go. And there will continue to be talk about the banker from Beirut. For if Ted Maher started the fire, there was always smoke around Edmond Safra.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Each night in Monte Carlo, it is said, a recording of predatory birds is transmitted through hidden loudspeakers in the main square to prevent sparrows from soiling the famous casino's pristine lawn. And each morning a platoon of gardeners removes dying petals from the immaculate flowerbeds. Amid such stainless perfection, a prison could look embarrassingly conspicuous. The authorities in the world's wealthiest state have dealt with the problem by locating the local jail on the very extremity of its tiny landmass. Of the thousands of tour- ists who file past the old fort on the rocky promontory of Monaco Ville, between the Oceanographic Museum and a cheesy celebration of the Grimaldi family called the Monte Carlo Story, very few realise that incarcerated within its walls are the principality's 20 or so prisoners. There are no signboards nor, indeed, any apparent entrance. The only clues to its true purpose are the bars on the windows and the battery of security cameras on the roof - hardly an atypical sight in Monaco. Among the inmates, most of whom are imprisoned for fraud or other white-collar crime, is Ted Maher, a 42-year-old former Green Beret in the US Army. Last December, Maher was arrested following the deaths of billionaire banker Edmond Safra and his nurse in circumstances that remain oblique and subject to a multitude of speculative theories. Initially, Maher was not a suspect. Those who were, suggested one newspaper, 'range from the Russian mafia to Japanese investors, through drug cartels and Middle Eastern trading companies'. It seemed that Safra, 67, who was renowned for his protective shield of Israeli bodyguards, was a man with no shortage of enemies. And, equally, Maher, a smalltown American who never travelled beyond US borders in his three years in the army, appeared to be someone who was a total stranger to both drug cartels and the Moscow mafia. How he came to be in Monaco was a result of unforeseeable happenstance. Working at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, where he had qualified as a licensed nurse, Maher found an expensive camera which he promptly returned to its owner. The photographer mentioned the story to an associate, Safra, who was sufficiently impressed to offer Maher a position as part of his 12-strong medical team - the banker suffered from Parkinson's Disease. The unworldly Maher spoke not a word of French. Safra, a Lebanese Jew with Brazilian nationality who lived mostly in the south of France, was fluent in French, English, Italian, Portuguese, Arabic and Hebrew. Maher was a tall, slender man with an open manner. Safra was short and bald and enigmatic. Maher had an ongoing property dispute with his next-door neighbour in upper New York State. Safra owned a vast penthouse in Monaco and La Leopolda, the magnificent villa in Villefranche built on the estate that once belonged to Belgium's genocidal King Leopold II. He also possessed homes in Paris, Geneva, London, New York and Brazil. In any other circumstances, the closest Maher might have come to Safra would have been to cash a cheque in one of his banks. But, as it was, Maher left his wife and three children in Stormville, New York, and his secure post at Columbia-Presbyterian, and flew to the French Riviera and a $600-a-day ringside view of the life of one of the world's richest and most mysterious men. As far back as 1957, Edmond Safra was named as a drug trafficker in a US Bureau of Narcotics report. The accusation was later withdrawn, but until his death Safra was the inspiration for countless unsubstantiated rumours that linked him to drug, gold and currency trafficking, money laundering and organised crime. The Safra family came from the Halabi merchants of northern Lebanon, a close-knit clan of Sephardic Jewish traders who historically made their money from financing the camel caravans of the Middle East. Edmond's father Jacob opened the family bank in 1920, building on the Safras' long experience in gold and currency exchange. Sephardic tradition maintained that the family business should be passed on to the oldest son. But such was his precocious interest in banking that the young Edmond leapfrogged his elder brother, Elie, to be selected by his father as the prime heir. At just 16, Edmond went to Milan to learn the banking business and then on to Brazil, where he set up his first bank at the age of 21. In contrast to most banks, Safra's was built on deposits rather than loans. It may be this strategy that originally led some observers to view Safra's banks as attractive propositions for money launderers. Five years ago, New York magazine ran an investigation into Safra's Republic National Bank in which it claimed that the bank 'quickly became known on the street as a bank that would send an armoured car to pick up large sums from its more secretive customers'. In the 80s, Safra and Republic were the targets of a global whispering campaign. Among the allegations that surfaced in a variety of mostly obscure publications was the suggestion that he was involved in the Iran-Contra affair; that he arranged the murder of a security specialist who had supposedly discovered a link between him and the arms-for-hostages scandal; that he had double-crossed the Medellin cocaine cartel; that he was a confr\u00e8re of mafia legend Mayer Lansky; and that Republic had laundered the drug-trafficking profits of Panama's General Noriega. Only the last claim had any basis in established fact, and Republic was only one of a number of banks that held Noriega's funds. Eventually, Safra proved in court that the rumours emanated from his corporate rivals, American Express, which had bought Republic's Swiss parent company, TDB, in an acrimonious deal in 1983 (Safra regained control in 1988). American Express was forced to apologise and donate $8m to a number of charities, including the Anti-Defamation League. For many people in and around the world of banking, however, Safra's legal victory served only to increase their suspicions of the secretive Lebanese businessman. In New York and London it was customary to grin in a knowing fashion whenever Safra's name was mentioned. Now the grins were that much wider. Bryan Burrough ascribed the slurs aimed at Safra to anti-Semitism in his book Vendetta: American Express and the Smearing of Edmond Safra . But if anti-Semitism alone was the reason for the stories, then why was Safra singled out and not the innumerable other Jewish bankers operating in high finance? It would be rather as if Michael Jordan had been selected for racist abuse on account of being a black player in basketball. Whatever the true explanation for the attacks, Safra was acutely sensitive to their effect on his good name. He was determined to sue any publication, however small, that repeated the libels. While American Express was waging its smear campaign, American customs officers were investigating Safra's banks for laundering Colombian drug funds. No charges were brought. Yet when the news emerged that Safra was dead, the prime suspects were not embittered former American Express executives or Colombian drug lords, but the Russian mafia, or mafiya . Three factors pointed in its direction. First, Republic's dealings with Russia were well documented. Under licence from the US government, Republic shipped around $10bn of US currency a year to Russian banks. Although perfectly legal, the shipments caused no little consternation among some state agencies. The problem was that many banks in Russia, and up to 50 that Republic was trading currency with, were suspected of being at the very least unreliable and quite possibly fronts for the mafiya. Referring to this apparent criminalisation of cash, a source from the Criminal Investi gation Bureau of New York State Banking Department told New York magazine: 'To us it was like a sore on Cindy Crawford's face.' Second, at the time of his death, Safra was engaged in the protracted and problematic sale of Republic to HSBC. There were various hold-ups, but one of them was said to be the Russian accounts that were frozen as a result of Federal investigation into money laundering, which Republic itself prompted by alerting the authorities to its concerns. Observers speedily concluded that a short-changed mafiya chief had sought revenge. Some 90 or so bankers have been killed in Russia since the collapse of the Soviet Union. 'What you have to understand,' Stephen Handelman, an expert on the mafiya and author of Comrade Criminal , told me, 'is that bankers are different in Russia. Over 2,000 banks were set up after 1989, most of which have since collapsed, and many of the people behind them had emerged from the black market and criminal backgrounds. So often when a banker is killed he may himself be involved in the mafiya.' And third, the French Riviera, which enjoys a rich history of Russian influence dating back to 19th-century aristocrats, had seen a sudden and ostentatious influx of newly wealthy Russians. Tales of Moscow businessmen buying yachts and property for cash formed the gossip of sales people from Cannes up to Menton, who, while often offended, seldom refused the money. In Nice, the mafiya was said to have bought into the exclusive Marina Baie des Anges, where the head of one Russian crime gang was arrested with false papers and fled to Monaco. In the past three years, Monaco has itself expelled 15 Russians suspected of illegal business practices, including a former KGB colonel. And some lawyers say that Monaco has now adopted an unofficial policy of refusing entry to all Russians. Arnaud Montauibourg, a French MP who led a parliamentary investigation into the mafiya, thinks the mafiya has already 'penetrated Monaco', laundering money 'through real estate, the casino and through trusts'. Sitting outside the Caf\u00e9 de Paris in Monte Carlo on a soft autumn evening earlier this month, watching the hopefuls making their way to the casino, it was not hard to spot the Russian businessmen. They have little apparent fear of cultural stereotyping. Thus two men with gold bracelets and neck chains sat drinking vodka and smoking weighty cigars, largely ignoring their two women companions whose compliant demeanour, polite laughter and visible stocking garters made it plain that they were part of the night's entertainment bill. It's this kind of egregious behaviour that has placed the Russians, whether legitimate business people or not, at the centre of a near moral panic hereabouts. The Russians are coming, is the anxious chorus on the Cte d'Azur, and everyone assumed they had come for Safra. At 5am on the morning of 3 December last year, Ted Maher awoke his boss with news that two masked men had broken into the belle \u00e9poque building at 17 Avenue D'Ostende in Monaco. Maher was bleeding from three stab wounds. Although a former Green Beret, Maher had served as a medical auxiliary. He had no more experience of combat than he did of high-style living. He was there to tend his employer, not protect him. For that, Safra had his Israeli army bodyguards. But not in Monaco. So safe did he feel in his penthouse next to the renowned Hotel Hermitage, that he maintained the security team at La Leopolda, 10 miles away. It was there during the 80s that Safra, under the guidance of his Brazilian socialite wife, held celebrity-enriched parties of daunting splendour. Lily, whom Safra married in 1976, had three children from a previous marriage and was independently a very rich woman. Nevertheless, the prenuptial agreement she signed was said to have run to 600 pages. It was she who ensured that names such as Aristotle Onassis and Frank Sinatra were included on the Safras' guest list. John Fairchild, the arbiter of American high-society standing, was moved to speak of the couple's 'meteoric rise to social power'. But social acceptance had not lessened Safra's near-phobic paranoia. He always carried blue gemstones to ward off the evil eye, and retained an abiding fear of curses. He was deeply superstitious about the number five and was terrified of being kidnapped. So he must have been deeply scared early that morning when he learned from Maher that the state-of-the-art security system in the building, which also housed three banks, had been breached. Immediately, Safra retreated with another of his nurses, 52-year-old Viviane Torrente, to his steel-reinforced bathroom. Within minutes a fire broke out. This is how Monaco's assistant prosecutor Catherine Le Lay described the scene: 'The apartment is immense, and within it there are two separate wings, one for Mr Safra and one for his wife. Mr Safra was in his wing, which consisted of three rooms - his bedroom, a nursing laboratory and a bathroom. With him were two nurses. The police received a call from the receptionist of the building. She had been alerted by the male nurse, who had staggered from the apartment which occupies the fifth and sixth floors, down to the ground floor. He had been injured with a knife with a six-inch blade. 'The police arrived at the scene extremely quickly and when they arrived they were un able immediately to access the apartment, which is protected by steel-reinforced doors. When they did gain entry with the firemen, the fire had already taken hold in the flat, which was extremely difficult to bring under control. When the police were finally able to penetrate the flat, they found Mr Safra dead where he had taken refuge in the bathroom with his nurse, Viviane Torrente, who also died. 'His wife was not even roused by the drama. It is difficult to convey just how big this flat is, but I have never seen anything like it. She was separated by a good distance from her husband and each door was reinforced. By the time the firemen had mastered the fire, smoke was only beginning to affect her wing of the flat, which would have rendered her more deeply unconscious. We still don't know how the attackers got into the flat, or how they escaped.' Safra and Torrente died from smoke inhalation. The fumes reached them through the fire-detection system. With its 500 officers, Monaco is probably the most intensively policed square mile anywhere on the planet - the local constabulary likes to boast that it can close down all exit routes from the principality in minutes. Its border with France is only notional, but the police always man it. Its streets and buildings are also the world's most intensively filmed. Very few square feet remain unrecorded by the ubiquitous security cameras. But there was no sign of the intruders. The idea that two men could break into the heavily secured home of one of the world's wealthiest men, cause his death and leave without trace did not sit well with Monaco's reputation as a crime-free zone for the super-rich. The police became convinced that it was an inside job. Within two days of Safra's death, Maher was arrested. And, shortly afterwards, he told police that he had stabbed himself and started a fire and that there were no intruders, masked or otherwise. His actions, he said, were an attempt to gain his boss's respect. He spoke of not getting along with the head nurse, a woman named Sonia, and how he wished to circumvent her power by demonstrating his loyalty to Safra. At a news conference, chief prosecutor Daniel Serdet quoted from Maher's police statement: 'It was my own dark ideas which led me to do this.' This was an extraordinary turnaround. From a story of high-financial corruption and international gangsterism, it became one of a misguided approach to job promotion. Police announced Maher's confession on 6 December, the same day that Safra was buried in Geneva. Around 1,000 mourners attended the ceremony at the Hekhal Haness synagogue, including the Nobel Peace laureate Eli Wiesel, Israel's foreign minister David Levy, Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan and former United Nations secretary general, Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar. Also, on the same day, the US Federal Reserve approved the sale of Republic to HSBC Holdings, and four weeks to the day after Safra's death the $9.85bn deal was completed, netting Safra's heirs some $2.8bn. Could it really be that strange and that straightforward? In America, the conspiracy theorists' medium, the internet, has been hot with indignation. There is much talk of Maher's 'imprisonment as a scapegoat for Russian money- launderers' and he is referred to as 'prisoner of war'. 'Please help him,' runs one appeal, 'before he is killed by the Monaco government or the responsible parties that did commit this crime and used Ted as a scapegoat.' Much of the stuff is hysterically xenophobic, virulently right-wing and clearly the work of delusional minds. Of course, that doesn't mean that Maher isn't a fall guy. However, his defence team certainly do not see Maher as the victim of a fiendish plot. Georges Blot, Maher's Monegasque lawyer, has gone on record as saying that his client started the fire and stabbed himself. 'The first words Ted said to me when I met him were: \"This is horrible. I loved him. I admired him. I respected him. I don't understand why I did it.\"' Maher's family in the US are unimpressed. They say that the internal security videotapes, which they believe would prove Maher's innocence, have gone missing (Monaco police say the video system was not working). And Maher's wife Heidi, argues that her husband's legal defence is compromised because it is state-appointed. 'The Monaco government is paying Ted's lawyer, Mr Blot, which is clearly a conflict of interest,' she has said. In fact, that is common legal practice, and indeed a human right, in most countries on occasions when the accused cannot afford a lawyer. Yet while Monaco is not implicated in a cover-up, there is a sense that it is actively presenting an untroubled face to the world. This is not the first time that a banker's death has caused a scandal in the region. Back in 1990, Jean Ferry, an official of the Industrial Bank of Monaco (BIM), was found dead from a bullet wound in the head. The police decided it was suicide, but a subsequent investigation found that a client of Ferry had constructed a large-scale fraud involving BIM. It also discovered that lax practices encouraging foreign tax evasion were endemic within the Monaco banking system. The most common method exploited a law which enabled foreign investors to create 'shell' companies in the names of Monegasque citizens (for a small payment). It has often been alleged that the system is abused by organised crime. Roger Bianchini, a journalist with Nice-Matin , told an author of a book on the Grimaldis: 'The whole system is well known to the initiated. But when underground deals begin to surface and scandal breaks through, Prince Rainier becomes concerned that the image of the principality could be tarnished.' As with other wealthy climes, such as Beverly Hills, the very sheen of Monaco's surface leads the visitor to suspect some form of moral corruption lurking underneath. The old wedding-cake architecture that survives is placed in the shade by the huge apartment-block developments that Rainier green-lighted in the 60s, creating an odd combination of sickly innocence and brash confidence. Although there is a refreshing sea breeze and the streets are neurotically clean, the faintest smell of pollution hangs in the air alongside the sweet fragrance of jasmine. And there is a disturbing sense that no amount of money will wash it away. For all its publicity-seeking glamour, Monaco thrives on secrecy. The government and its institutions, such as the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Bains de Mer, which runs the casino and hotels and much else, and which are all essentially arms of the Grimaldi empire ruled by Prince Rainier, are unapologetically opaque. Bankers may be attracted to secrecy, but so are storytellers. One of the more fanciful ideas doing the rounds has it that the Grimaldi grip on Monaco includes extensive telephone tapping based on a word-trigger system. 'If you said something derogatory about a Grimaldi it would undoubtedly hit the trigger,' suggests one observer. Against this backdrop of fantasy, any explanation of events provided by Monaco, the so-called Disneyland Dictatorship, would never be seen as the whole story. And indeed there are inconsistencies. Even Safra's widow's lawyer, Marc Bonnant, was concerned to ask that all the evidence be made available. 'We would like to have all the details of the nurse's confession. Was it credible and complete, what exactly pushed him to do what he did, how many fires did he set, are there any inconsistencies in his confession? A thousand questions come to mind which need answers to make any sense out of this tragic and absurd death.' Among those questions, perhaps, are why did Safra remain in the bathroom even after the police arrived and why did it take two long hours for the fire brigade to get inside the bathroom? And why is it that Maher is said to have started only one fire and yet investigators located two separate origins? In early official reports it was stated - unambiguously by assistant prosecutor Le Lay - that Lily Safra did not speak to her husband during his confinement in the bathroom, that she was asleep. Elsewhere there were reports that she had spoken to him on a mobile phone. Bonnant told me, 'Edward Safra spoke twice to his wife, to his bodyguard and to the police.' Then why did he not emerge from the bathroom? Bonnant says that everyone was still under the impression that two armed intruders were in the building, which is also why the fire brigade made slow progress. But given the police presence and his own security guard, Safra must have been paralysed with fear not to feel confident enough to come out. Who did he think was after him? Bonnant is quick to scotch any talk of assassins. 'Look, if you want to kill a man, you pay $20,000 and you get the job done the right way by a professional. The right way is not to hire a nurse to start a small fire and hope that the police take two hours to get to him.' An insider on Maher's defence team echoes this point. 'People have told me they know for sure that Safra was shot with two bullets. Now the defence is going to see the inside of the building and we've asked for further fire reports and to look at video film outside the home. It might be that we'll see two guys in balaclavas on top of the roof, but I don't think so. And you have to ask, why were there no holes in Ted's clothes where his wounds were? Did the intruders thoughtfully lift up his shirt before stabbing him?' Handelman also dismissed the idea that Russians were behind Safra's death. 'It just wasn't their MO. Not outside Russia. Most people thought Safra was holding IOUs or money for the mafiya, but they wouldn't have killed him for that.' But he added: 'You can always be surprised.' After Maher's confession was made public, people began to ask how Safra had ever come to employ a man with such evident psychological problems. Suddenly it was common knowledge that Maher had a prescription-drug problem - according to Serdet - a history of violence and unstable personality traits. His colleagues at Columbia-Presbyterian countered these stories and provided an image of a reliable and motivated worker. 'He was really on top of things,' said one paediatrician. 'In fact, he was one of the better nurses I've seen.' Bonnant has said that Maher was properly vetted through 'in-depth background checks', as well as being interviewed by Safra himself. 'The fact that Maher is unstable became apparent to us only after the accident. Nothing in Maher's files showed the slightest trace of mental instability.' Perhaps because it wasn't there. Some newspaper articles quoted a former neighbour who quarrelled with Maher. 'He was a miserable bastard,' said 70-year- old Leonard Levelle, who accused Maher of physical assault. According to Maher's defence, Levelle himself was cautioned a number of times by the police. Much was also made of Mayer's leaving the Las Vegas police force after only three months. His defence say he quit because he contracted spinal meningitis. So was it a bizarre aberration? 'The reality of the situation is not something Ted can articulate,' say his defence. But the same source believed Maher was under pressure because his wife wanted him to return home and he wanted to stay in Monaco. What even his detractors agree on is that Maher never intended to kill Safra. 'If he wanted to,' said Serdet, 'he would have had 10,000 chances a day.' The fire simply got out of hand because he started it in an acrylic wastepaper basket. However, Maher is currently charged on a count of arson leading to death, a crime which carries a maximum life sentence. In his Monte Carlo office, high above the Boulevard des Moulins, Donald Manasse, an American-Frenchman who is assisting Georges Blot, told me, 'Ted is not guilty of the crimes as charged and we are seeking a requalification of the charges.' Optimistically, he might be looking at four to six years. But that's still a very severe sentence for what basically amounts to an accident. Bonnant demonstrated the Safra family's determination to gain what they see as justice. He told me: 'We want to ensure that the one who caused this will be properly punished.' The trial is unlikely to come to court until early next year. The investigating judge, Patricia Richett is still conducting her inquiry. Given the profile and importance of Safra, and the sensitivity of the Monaco authorities, fears have been expressed by those close to Maher that the investigation might be partial. Manasse was certain that Richett would not succumb to external pressure from any direction. 'Anyone who would say she could be influenced by third parties,' he told me, 'has no idea who she is.' Maher, it seems, does have one influential supporter himself. Dominic Dunne, the celebrated Vanity Fair writer and crusader against criminal injustice, is known to be sympathetic towards his plight. And the Monegasques have taken due notice. 'When Serdet heard that Dunne was arriving in Monaco,' a legal source said, 'he was practically saying, \"We've got to get this right, Dominic Dunne is coming to town.\"' In the meantime, Maher, the man who wanted to gain attention, is locked up in a prison that dare not speak its name, removed from his Mediterranean idyll, but tantalisingly trapped a few feet from the sea. He has no visitors, save his lawyers and the American consulate representative, and of course the tourists passing unknowingly by on their way to see a different Monte Carlo story. Life in Monaco continues as ever in its own secretive way. On a brilliant morning with seagulls circling overhead and the roar of the Monaco Kart Cup ripping around the bay, I stopped outside 17 Avenue D'Ostende. The fire damage is now mostly repaired, and just to be certain, I asked a policeman where Monsieur Safra had lived. He looked at me with a thin smile and said, ' Je ne sais pas.' Then he walked away. After Safra's burial, Eli Wiesel said of the close friend he often called his brother: 'After all, what remains of a man after his death? It is his name, his reputation, his honour.' And, a less circumspect man might have added, his money. Already there is talk of family disputes about where it will go. And there will continue to be talk about the banker from Beirut. For if Ted Maher started the fire, there was always smoke around Edmond Safra.",

Physiologically, the skin consists of millions of cells that rely on a regular supply of oxygen and nutrients for their survival, so adverse changes in your general health or the balance of nutrients you quickly start to show in your skin.</p> <p>The skin consists of three layers. The deepest is the subcutaneous layer, which contains the main blood vessels, fat and two types of protein: collagen, which provides the skin with a smooth, firm texture, and elastin, which makes it resilient. The middle layer, the dermis, which contains more blood vessels, hair follicles and sweat glands, protects the subcutaneous layer and supplies the epidermis - the upper layer - with new skin cells. The epidermis is covered in dead skin cells, which are shed and replaced daily. When it comes to anti-ageing strategies, two of the skin's main components to nourish and preserve are collagen and elastin, because wrinkles develop when these protein fibres deteriorate, a process greatly accelerated by exposure to sunlight.</p> <p>The skin's arch enemies are free radicals, unstable molecules that occur naturally in our bodies and are also produced by sunlight, smoke, air pollution and certain foods. Free radicals damage cells and can cause them to behave abnormally, in extreme cases triggering cancerous and other disease-related responses. It is possible to reduce the damage caused by making sure your diet is rich in the foods that limit the effect and by avoiding activities and foods that encourage their production. Among the latter are hydrogenated vegetable oils, found in margarines and ready-made products such as cakes and biscuits.</p> <p>The antioxidant vitamins C and E, selenium, betacarotene and bioflavonoids can protect your skin against free-radical damage by soaking up the rogue molecules. All fruits and vegetables are rich in antioxidants. Although bioflavonoids are particularly concentrated in the peel, skin or outer layers of citrus fruits, I recommend that you wash them before eating them, in order to rid them of waxes and residues.

Cardiovascular exercise generally keeps you looking younger, as do facial exercises that preserve good muscular structure. Yo-yo dieting is the worst thing that you can do, as repeated bouts of weight loss and gain can result in sagging, stretchmarks and wrinkling.

Keeping a glass of water by the radiator when the central heating is blasting out dehydrating heat will moisten the air, and thus also your skin, as will using moisturising lotions.

Yo-yo dieting is the worst thing that you can do, as repeated bouts of weight loss and gain can result in sagging, stretchmarks and wrinkling. Creams can't protect you from stretchmarks, but losing weight gradually - say, a kilogram a week - allows the skin to shrink and stretch gently. Finally, because lack of water is one of the most common causes of unhealthy-looking skin, aim to drink 2.5l of water a day and keep alcohol and caffeine intake down. Keeping a glass of water by the radiator when the central heating is blasting out dehydrating heat will moisten the air, and thus also your skin, as will using moisturising lotions. Water not only keeps the skin hydrated, but enables the body to glean all of food's skin-preserving, free-radical-fighting, antioxidant nutrients. \u0095 Jane Clarke is a state-registered dietician and author of the Bodyfoods series of books.",

      "body": "<p>Given the choice, the public chose Sainsbury's. Offered its pick of every new building in the land, it turned its back on the austere reconstruction of Tate Modern, on the pomo funfairness of the London Eye and on the steel-and-glass clich\u00e9s of a hundred Lottery-funded arts centres. Instead, when - for the first time - we the people were asked to make our selection for the Stirling Prize, our most prestigious architecture competition, we plumped for Sainsbury's.</p> <p>Not any old Sainsbury's, but the new one just down the road from the Dome and across the Thames from Norman Foster's Canary Wharf Tube station - which came second in the people's vote by just one vote. (For the record, I cast my vote for Southwark Tube station. The final victor will be announced next Saturday evening, when the great, the good and the dinner-jacketed will gather in front of the cameras of Channel 4 to announce - live! from the Wellcome Wing of the Science Museum! - the winner of this year's glittering prize.)</p> <p>It's an eco-friendly branch of 'the nation's favourite supermarket', with all clever kinds of stuff built into it - natural lighting balanced by computer-controlled louvres on top, wind-and-solar-powered totem signs out front and 75m-deep boreholes down below to run the cooling system. I tried it out, did a house shop there on a Thursday lunchtime - \u00a371.43 for 29 items, including half a dozen decent oysters (\u00a32.94), a double pack of apple and mango juice (\u00a33.49) and a Savoy cabbage (99p). On the way out, I splurged a ridiculous \u00a32.90 on a venti mocha frappuccino at the inhouse Starbucks. I was, in short, everyshopper for the afternoon.</p> <p>Designed by the previously obscure firm Chetwood Associates, it's a fine addition to Sainsbury's long association with proper architecture - Samantha Hardingham's guide to recent English architecture lists four branches, not including Nick Grimshaw's masterfully brutish one in Camden Town. The Greenwich store is already the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors building of the year.

      "bodyText": "Given the choice, the public chose Sainsbury's. Offered its pick of every new building in the land, it turned its back on the austere reconstruction of Tate Modern, on the pomo funfairness of the London Eye and on the steel-and-glass clich\u00e9s of a hundred Lottery-funded arts centres. Instead, when - for the first time - we the people were asked to make our selection for the Stirling Prize, our most prestigious architecture competition, we plumped for Sainsbury's. Not any old Sainsbury's, but the new one just down the road from the Dome and across the Thames from Norman Foster's Canary Wharf Tube station - which came second in the people's vote by just one vote. (For the record, I cast my vote for Southwark Tube station. The final victor will be announced next Saturday evening, when the great, the good and the dinner-jacketed will gather in front of the cameras of Channel 4 to announce - live! from the Wellcome Wing of the Science Museum! - the winner of this year's glittering prize.) It's an eco-friendly branch of 'the nation's favourite supermarket', with all clever kinds of stuff built into it - natural lighting balanced by computer-controlled louvres on top, wind-and-solar-powered totem signs out front and 75m-deep boreholes down below to run the cooling system. I tried it out, did a house shop there on a Thursday lunchtime - \u00a371.43 for 29 items, including half a dozen decent oysters (\u00a32.94), a double pack of apple and mango juice (\u00a33.49) and a Savoy cabbage (99p). On the way out, I splurged a ridiculous \u00a32.90 on a venti mocha frappuccino at the inhouse Starbucks. I was, in short, everyshopper for the afternoon. Designed by the previously obscure firm Chetwood Associates, it's a fine addition to Sainsbury's long association with proper architecture - Samantha Hardingham's guide to recent English architecture lists four branches, not including Nick Grimshaw's masterfully brutish one in Camden Town. The Greenwich store is already the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors building of the year. It's elegant, clever and good at the important bit of its job - making your shop easy, calm and joyful. Its low profile and grassed-over, sloping walls make it look not at all unpleasantly Teletubbyish. The 'steel-framed, 280m radius, barrel-vault roof with integrated radiating northlight double-glazed strips' both gives a clear, soft light and has a wry zoomorphism to it - suggesting the skeleton of some giant prehistoric sea thing which got beached on the Greenwich peninsula when the North Sea retreated back towards the dodgems and whelk stalls of Southend.

      "body": "<p>When I was in my early teens, I used to tape the Top 40, every week, every record, from 40 up to Number One. No editing required: ELO, Bucks Fizz, The Kids From Fame sat alongside The Jam, The Clash, John Lennon, and I thought of them all the same. They were just music, the soundtrack to the hopes and obsessions and unspecific hatred of teenage life. When I got a babysitting job and started buying records, I progressed into making compilation tapes: these too, were a mishmash of quality and dross. My brother and I didn't have enough records of our own to fill a 90-minute tape, so my parents' collection - Frank Sinatra, Petula Clark, Burt Bacharach, Bobbie Gentry - was raided to make up numbers. (Taping was a tricky business in the DIY days of the 80s. We had one of those flat-box tape recorders whose microphone registered - fuzzily - every noise within a 4ft radius.

Right: New Order, Aretha Franklin, The Fall, Sam Cooke. Wrong: Howard Jones. So I began editing my still-meagre record collection, taping from friends', listening to John Peel, going to clubs, acquiring knowledge and taste and a personal soundtrack that hinted at an intriguing, seductive inner life. 'Ooh, you like Prefab Sprout and Public Enemy! Sensitive yet punchy! A bedwetter with an attitude problem! Care for a shag?' </p> <p>Such musical - and therefore personal - revision isn't uncommon.

We strive to learn discernment, to acquire good taste. Yet bad taste will always haunt you. You wake up humming Sonique, you find your foot tapping to Johnny Hates Jazz. Failing memory may mean that you can't recall the name of the shadow trade and industry secretary, nor, indeed, your beloved's birthday.

Essentially, such programmes are just compilation tapes without the aren't-I-clever reworking of hindsight. So you have to sit through Sheena Easton to get to David Bowie, Vanilla Ice to get to Happy Mondays. And you are appalled, and then inspired, because now you can see how great 'Ashes to Ashes' was and you actually understand the words to 'Too Much, Too Young' and you wiggle on the sofa in wonder at 'Kinky Afro' and you finally realise that 'Dance Yourself Dizzy' was utter cack.

The Norwich and Peterborough society offers green mortgages to those with homes that already have a good efficiency rating, or to individuals who want to upgrade their homes to that level. Both societies specialise in self-build mortgages for individuals building their own houses - often the best way of maximising energy-efficiency at home. How to save energy Low-cost or no-cost ways to cut your heating bills: \u0095 Draw curtains at night to prevent heat being lost through windows \u0095 Turn the thermostat down by one degree celsius and heat your home one hour less daily \u0095 Keep the thermostat on your water heater at about 60 degrees celsius \u0095 Showers use less water than baths - and put the plug in your sink to avoid leaving the hot tap running \u0095 Turn off lights when you leave rooms for long periods, and switch off TVs properly - 'standby' uses up to 60 per cent of the electricity \u0095 Defrost fridges regularly \u0095 Make sure washing machines and dishwashers have full loads, and use low-temperature settings if possible \u0095 Use only the minimum water you need for cooking or making drinks \u0095 Use low-energy lamps: they use 75 per cent less electricity and last 10 times as long \u0095 Insulate the loft, which often accounts for the loss of 25 per cent of a house's heat, and make sure hot water tanks and pipes are lagged Source: London Electricity Contacts Free government energy-saving pack 0345 277200 Online energy efficiency tips at www.saveenergy.co.uk Local Energy Efficiency Advice Centre 0800 512 012 Berkeley Homes 01256 814314 Try Homes 01932 245 800 Ecology Building Society 01535 635933 Norwich and Peterborough Building Society 01733 372372",

      "body": "<p>Many couples may have shuddered when they heard this month about the sad case of widow Sadie Dalziel, whose damages following the death of her husband were reduced by \u00a3100,000 in a court case because he had been cheating on her. </p> <p>Jason Dalziel died in 1996, at the age of 26, when his motorbike collided with a car. His wife, now 30, had never suspected his infidelity until she found out he had been involved for a year with the woman who was the pillion passenger in the accident. Elizabeth Simpson survived the crash and provided more evidence of the fragility of the Dalziel marriage - because he had also proposed to her. </p> <p>Under existing law, Privilege Insurance, the car driver's insurer, was entirely within its rights to ask that the damages be reduced to the widow on the grounds that the marriage looked un-likely to last. The judge, who presided over the High Court hearing this month, Robert Moxon-Browne QC, was also acting in accordance with the law when he reduced Sadie Dalziel's payout by about 40 per cent because he believed the argument that the marriage was quite likely to fall apart. </p> <p>Although the Association of British Insurers claims the case is something of a one-off, many married couples may wonder what could happen to them in similar circumstances. Figures from the Office of National Statistics show that while 304,000 couples tied the knot in 1998, about 160,000 got divorced. With divorce rates of about 50 per cent, should we all be worried? </p> <p>The answer is probably yes. Even Mrs Dalziel's solicitor, David Faithful of Amery Parkes in Birmingham, accepts the basic law is very clear: 'The way the law stands at the mo-ment, judges are entitled to discount damages on the basis that there will be a divorce.' </p> <p>Faithful believes there could be many disputes of this type, although few go to court: 'These cases are very, very rare. It's a matter for insurers what tactics they adopt.' </p> <p>Fighting this sort of case is very expensive. It has cost Mrs Dalziel about \u00a310,000 and the issue of money is going to lie very heavily with her, a nursery nurse, when she decides in the next three weeks whether to appeal. </p> <p>There are two ways this sort of dispute could be treated more sympathetically. The first would involve a more un-derstanding view of marital strife by judges. Many experts believe infidelity is not a strong indicator of relationship breakdown. </p> <p>Family solicitor Mark Har-per of law firm Withers will not comment on the Dalziel case but asks: 'How can a judge make a decision as to whe-ther a marriage is likely to end just because there has been an affair? Many of my clients tell me of past affairs which have not led to the breakdown of the marriage. It is a very big assumption to say that the existence of another relationship would lead to the breakdown of the marriage. Who can make that judgment?' </p> <p>It seems as if many other legal and family experts agree. The Law Commission last year urged the government to change procedures so that damages would be reduced only if there were objective evidence of impending divorce, such as the start of divorce proceedings. </p> <p>The commission is charged with making recommendations for better law. About 70 per cent of its recommendations do eventually make it to the statute books. But the big problem is usually finding the political will for the allocation of parliamentary time. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Lord Chancellor's Department said: 'The issue is being looked at by officials - but there isn't yet a set date for publishing a definitive report.' </p> <p>So the status quo will prevail. Damages in these sorts of cases are set very clinically under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976. This legislation sets out the procedures for calculating 'dependency claims' - looking at how much the de-ceased earned, for instance, assuming that 75 per cent of the income went on maintaining the family, deducting the other 25 per cent from the claim, deducting the surviving spouse's income, calculating the life expectancy of the spouse and then making other deductions for possible divorce, poor promotion pros-pects or ill health of the deceased. </p> <p>Solicitor Anne Davies of law firm Vizards Staples &amp; Bannisters acts for insurance companies and believes the Dalziel case could become an important one. 'The judgment will be used in other cases where a wid-ow is claiming against third parties,' she says. 'There seems to have been a very substantial reduction for a risk that seems to be not particularly quantifiable.' </p> <p>Insurance lawyers will scrutinise the transcript of the judgement when it comes out - to see if other factors, such as Jason Dal- ziel's apparently poor promotion prospects in the army, also played a part in the discounts to the damages. </p> <p>The case has clear implications for other people who are killed through the negligence of others. As well as traffic accidents, it could apply to disputes over people killed in the workplace. But, says Davies, it has fewer implications for people with life policies, travel insurance policies and other direct contracts with insurance companies. 'I would want to look at the wording of a life policy, but normally there wouldn't be a deduction of this kind to a widow,' she says. </p> <p>The difference between the two types of case is that the Dalziel claim is against a third party, the driver of the car which killed her husband, someone whose liability to her was based on his negligence. But a claim on a spouse's insurance policy is one based on a very clear contract which sets out the basis for any claim. </p> <p>Could it be possible, however, for lawyers in cases of the Dalziel kind to force down damages payments on the grounds that one in two marriages is likely to fail? 'Even as a lawyer who de-fends insurance companies, I would find that an unpalatable argument,' says Davies. 'I don't think it would be accepted.' </p> <p>But we do not know what is happening in the cases settled out of court.</p>",

He was looking for wooden toys for his son but was disappointed with what he'd found in the shops. His market research consisted of thinking: 'If I want to buy wooden toys, so must a lot of other people'. </p> <p>Nigel owns the company with his wife Jo. He employs eight people, four full-time, the others part-time. This year he expects his turnover to be \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>'When you run your own business, everything is down to you,' he says. 'It cost me far more money than I ever thought. If you think it's going to cost you \u00a320,000 to set up your business, double it, and if you think you're going to get a salary from it in six months, budget on 12. </p> <p>'There are so many unknowns and potential mistakes. I remember working out that if I placed an advert in a particular magazine with a readership of 1 million and got a response of 1 per cent, I would get so much. It was complete garbage: you just don't achieve that. Things never work out the way you'd think. </p> <p>'But I think that if I put in 100 per cent, things may not be as I planned, but they'll still be all right.' </p> <p>'The new catalogue went out in September. Before that, the financial situation was very close. We had very little money left. But we had to believe that the catalogue we were sending out would produce revenue. The moment it hits the mat, the phones ring.' </p> <p>'At the moment, I'm working a minimum of 14 hours a day, seven days a week. It's the busiest time of year and I have to put the hours in. I don't see my wife very much. I don't see our two children. But it's only between now and Christmas.' </p> <p>'I've got a couple of friends who run their own businesses, and everyone says the biggest problem is staff. You try to pay them a decent wage and look after them, but it's another learning curve for me. You have to learn about everything: accountancy, computers. Mail order is very analytical. We buy databases. It costs about 10p a person, but then you've got to print and post the catalogue. An average response is about 3 per cent. </p> <p>'When I check the competition, products I had last year are now appearing in other people's catalogues. I should be selling the doll's house for \u00a3130 but John Lewis is selling it at \u00a399.99 for Christmas, so to compete I also sell it at \u00a399.99. </p> <p>'I've never sold toys and I've never had a website so I'm going to make mistakes. But the quicker you realise that you've made a mistake and learn from it and move on, the better. If you try to hang on in there and think that things are going to get better, they're not.'</p> <p><strong>Hard graft to reach soft centre</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.druidchocolate.ie\">Druid Chocolates</a></p> <p>Dublin </p> <p>A love of chocolate has become a business for ex- insurance underwriter Gareth Vaughan and former teacher Ana Marcos.</p> <p>Gareth, from Dundalk in the Irish Republic, and Ana, from Spain, met when they were both working in Ipswich. His passion for chocolate started when he worked as a student in a chocolate shop in the US. Years later, he lived from savings and worked with the luxury chocolate company, Wittamer, in Brussels.</p> <p>They started Druid Chocolates in 1996 in Dublin, selling to specialist shops and through their own website. Fortnum and Mason is the first shop outside Ireland to sell their wares. Their turnover this year is expected to be \u00a3250,000.</p> <p>Gareth says: 'It hasn't been an easy ride and it's hard in that you do work 16 or 18 hours a day and you don't get a wage at the end of the month. You know that you have to move forward but you're finding your way.</p> <p>'When Ana and I came back to Ireland in 1996 we hooked up with an enterprise development programme in Dublin. They gave us a free telephone and about \u00a385 per week. We used a kitchen in the enterprise centre, so we didn't have to worry about health requirements and we started selling chocolates at farmers' markets.</p> <p>'The chocolate arrives in 10 kilo bricks of chocolate from Belgium. We blend it with fresh Irish cream and butter, and it has its own distinctive taste. We chose the name Druid because it has Celtic and magical associations, and rolls off the tongue.</p> <p>'I'm still not drawing a full salary but I am earning more than I was earning as an underwriter in Ipswich, although that was five years ago. Now there are eight people on the payroll. About a year ago we knew that we had to start paying ourselves salaries and making profits. The only way to do that was by taking on help to free us up to develop the marketing.</p> <p>'Starting the business was a personal thing as well as a business thing. Going from insurance to chocolate is a funny transition.</p> <p>'Yet while people in chocolate tend to work hard and get stressed at Christmas, they're happy.'</p> <p>Ana says: 'When I met Gareth he started giving me chocolates he'd made himself - classic truffles, with cocoa powder on top.

      "bodyText": "Toy story of long hours and faith in the catalogue Dawson &amp; Son Saffron Walden, Essex Nigel Dawson founded a mail order company selling traditional wooden toys after he was made redundant two years ago. He found himself with a 'reasonable' sum of money, which he lived on, and took the chance to set up Dawson &amp; Son. He was looking for wooden toys for his son but was disappointed with what he'd found in the shops. His market research consisted of thinking: 'If I want to buy wooden toys, so must a lot of other people'. Nigel owns the company with his wife Jo. He employs eight people, four full-time, the others part-time. This year he expects his turnover to be \u00a3500,000. 'When you run your own business, everything is down to you,' he says. 'It cost me far more money than I ever thought. If you think it's going to cost you \u00a320,000 to set up your business, double it, and if you think you're going to get a salary from it in six months, budget on 12. 'There are so many unknowns and potential mistakes. I remember working out that if I placed an advert in a particular magazine with a readership of 1 million and got a response of 1 per cent, I would get so much. It was complete garbage: you just don't achieve that. Things never work out the way you'd think. 'But I think that if I put in 100 per cent, things may not be as I planned, but they'll still be all right.' 'The new catalogue went out in September. Before that, the financial situation was very close. We had very little money left. But we had to believe that the catalogue we were sending out would produce revenue. The moment it hits the mat, the phones ring.' 'At the moment, I'm working a minimum of 14 hours a day, seven days a week. It's the busiest time of year and I have to put the hours in. I don't see my wife very much. I don't see our two children. But it's only between now and Christmas.' 'I've got a couple of friends who run their own businesses, and everyone says the biggest problem is staff. You try to pay them a decent wage and look after them, but it's another learning curve for me. You have to learn about everything: accountancy, computers. Mail order is very analytical. We buy databases. It costs about 10p a person, but then you've got to print and post the catalogue. An average response is about 3 per cent. 'When I check the competition, products I had last year are now appearing in other people's catalogues. I should be selling the doll's house for \u00a3130 but John Lewis is selling it at \u00a399.99 for Christmas, so to compete I also sell it at \u00a399.99. 'I've never sold toys and I've never had a website so I'm going to make mistakes. But the quicker you realise that you've made a mistake and learn from it and move on, the better. If you try to hang on in there and think that things are going to get better, they're not.' Hard graft to reach soft centre Druid Chocolates Dublin A love of chocolate has become a business for ex- insurance underwriter Gareth Vaughan and former teacher Ana Marcos. Gareth, from Dundalk in the Irish Republic, and Ana, from Spain, met when they were both working in Ipswich. His passion for chocolate started when he worked as a student in a chocolate shop in the US. Years later, he lived from savings and worked with the luxury chocolate company, Wittamer, in Brussels. They started Druid Chocolates in 1996 in Dublin, selling to specialist shops and through their own website. Fortnum and Mason is the first shop outside Ireland to sell their wares. Their turnover this year is expected to be \u00a3250,000. Gareth says: 'It hasn't been an easy ride and it's hard in that you do work 16 or 18 hours a day and you don't get a wage at the end of the month. You know that you have to move forward but you're finding your way. 'When Ana and I came back to Ireland in 1996 we hooked up with an enterprise development programme in Dublin. They gave us a free telephone and about \u00a385 per week. We used a kitchen in the enterprise centre, so we didn't have to worry about health requirements and we started selling chocolates at farmers' markets. 'The chocolate arrives in 10 kilo bricks of chocolate from Belgium. We blend it with fresh Irish cream and butter, and it has its own distinctive taste. We chose the name Druid because it has Celtic and magical associations, and rolls off the tongue. 'I'm still not drawing a full salary but I am earning more than I was earning as an underwriter in Ipswich, although that was five years ago. Now there are eight people on the payroll. About a year ago we knew that we had to start paying ourselves salaries and making profits. The only way to do that was by taking on help to free us up to develop the marketing. 'Starting the business was a personal thing as well as a business thing. Going from insurance to chocolate is a funny transition. 'Yet while people in chocolate tend to work hard and get stressed at Christmas, they're happy.' Ana says: 'When I met Gareth he started giving me chocolates he'd made himself - classic truffles, with cocoa powder on top. They didn't look very good, but I thought it was so romantic. We weren't happy with the jobs we were doing, and one day we suddenly said: \"Why don't we make them for other people?\" ' 'We had the spirit to do it. We looked under every stone for money and I didn't buy clothes for two years, but when you're busy doing what you want, nothing else matters. 'I used to dream about chocolate but now I dream about finances. I've learnt expressions that I can't translate into Spanish, such as cash flow management. Our sales are growing.

      "body": "<p><strong> Active funds back on track</strong><br> </p> <p>Managers of UK growth funds have started to outperform the tracker funds that merely mimic financial indices, according to a review of 98 funds by the financial ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's. </p> <p>Over the 12-month review period, the average total return from an actively managed fund was 11.1 per cent - compared with a 7.6 per cent rise in the FTSE All Share index and a 4.4 per cent increase in the FTSE 100. </p> <p>Managers of smaller companies funds fared even better, returning a sector average of 46.2 per cent, 18 per cent ahead of the FTSE small capitalisation ex-IT index. </p> <p>S&amp;P says the results show that active management comes into its own in volatile markets. But it warns investors to analyse a fund carefully before putting in money because there can be a big gap in the performance of the top and bottom funds in the review. </p> <p>Look for consistency of investment approach, it advises. </p> <p>Four mainstream funds have been awarded an AAA rating: ABN Amro UK Growth, Barings UK Growth Trust, Mercury Offshore Sterling United Kingdom, and the Newton Income.</p> <p><strong> Invest with style</strong><br> </p> <p>As if small investors do not have enough complexity to deal with, along comes another investment label: the style fund. </p> <p>This has nothing to do with catwalks, but describes the methods by which managers choose shares. Instead of selecting shares or bonds according to geography or themes - a specific industry, for example - they are chosen on the basis of whether they offer the prospect of a fast increasing share price, or long term value. </p> <p>Growth stocks will gener ally be found in fast-growing industries such as technology. Value stocks may be cheap compared to market averages or the company's asset base and may be in a mature industry. </p> <p>Investment house Schroders believes style investment funds will become widely marketed in the UK. It is launching seven funds, and renaming an eighth, offering a choice of growth or value funds in each of four markets: the UK, continental Europe, the US and Japan. </p> <p>The initial charges will be 5.25 per cent, discounted by 2 per cent to 3.25 per cent until 31 January. The annual management charge will be 1.5 per cent. Schroders expects them to be sold mainly through independent advisers.</p> <p><strong> Bungee cover</strong><br> </p> <p>Insurer MRL is aiming to under-cut the competition with a travel policy for the 600,000 young people who go backpacking each year. </p> <p>Prices start at \u00a349 for four months in Europe and \u00a389 for roving worldwide. It covers medical expenses, personal accidents, personal belongings and loss of passport expenses as well as hazardous activities such as bungee jumping and white water rafting. Contact MRL on 08708 450 050.</p> <p><strong> Down Under loans</strong><br> </p> <p>Borrowing with an Australian flavour is promised with the launch in Britain of the Commonwealth bank of Australia at the end of November. </p> <p>It will offer a range of flexible mortgages under the brand name NewWorld. </p> <p>It will offer features not currently found in the UK such as loan portability, product switching between most NewWorld offerings, and borrowers will be able to make their repayments weekly or fortnightly. </p> <p>As an introductory offer owner-occupiers will be offered a discount of 1.24 per cent off the standard vari able rate of 6.99 per cent. </p> <p>There will be no redemption penalties on non-fixed products. Visit NewWorld on mynewworld.com.</p> <p><strong> Cash machine</strong><br> </p> <p>Software from Microsoft aims to save you money by keeping track of your outgoings and helping manage your investments. </p> <p>The company says around a third of people either never know how much money is in their account or end up in the red. </p> <p>Key features of the standard Microsoft Money 2001 package include electronic bill payment and budgeting tools. It costs \u00a329.99. </p> <p>The \u00a349.99 Money 2001 financial suite will count air miles and organise school fee payments. An intriguing What If? feature shows how different scenarios could affect your finances.</p> <p><strong>Want a will? Here's a way</strong></p> <p>More than 1,300 solicitors around Britain are offering their services free of charge in November for people wishing to make a simple will. They will suggest a donation to charity of \u00a350 for a single will and \u00a375 for a couple. </p> <p>The scheme is the latest brainchild of Will Aid, an organisation set up by solicitor Graeme Pagan who took up fundraising in the mid-Eighties as a result of the Ethiopian famine. The money will go to several charities including the Red Cross, Christian Aid and Save the Children.</p> <p>Contact Will Aid on 0870 6060239.</p> <p><strong>Hector's hi-tech fiasco could win you a tax refund</strong></p> <p>Tax advisers are urging taxpayers to see whether they may be eligible for Inland Revenue refunds for 1997-98 following the Government's decision to write off more than 1 million tax records for that tax year. </p> <p>This follows difficulties at the Revenue with the introduction of a new computer system. Some taxpayers will escape tax they owe. Others who may be owed tax will have to make a claim.</p> <p>Among those likely to be affected are people who were employed for part of the year, and who paid tax through PAYE, but then gave up work. If they earned less than that year's personal allowance \u00a34.045, they may be able to claim a refund. Other beneficiaries could be people who gave up jobs to start businesses.</p> <p>Gerry Hart of the Tax Team, says: 'They are entitled to a year's personal allowance against a few months earnings.'

      "bodyText": "Active funds back on track Managers of UK growth funds have started to outperform the tracker funds that merely mimic financial indices, according to a review of 98 funds by the financial ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's. Over the 12-month review period, the average total return from an actively managed fund was 11.1 per cent - compared with a 7.6 per cent rise in the FTSE All Share index and a 4.4 per cent increase in the FTSE 100. Managers of smaller companies funds fared even better, returning a sector average of 46.2 per cent, 18 per cent ahead of the FTSE small capitalisation ex-IT index. S&amp;P says the results show that active management comes into its own in volatile markets. But it warns investors to analyse a fund carefully before putting in money because there can be a big gap in the performance of the top and bottom funds in the review. Look for consistency of investment approach, it advises. Four mainstream funds have been awarded an AAA rating: ABN Amro UK Growth, Barings UK Growth Trust, Mercury Offshore Sterling United Kingdom, and the Newton Income. Invest with style As if small investors do not have enough complexity to deal with, along comes another investment label: the style fund. This has nothing to do with catwalks, but describes the methods by which managers choose shares. Instead of selecting shares or bonds according to geography or themes - a specific industry, for example - they are chosen on the basis of whether they offer the prospect of a fast increasing share price, or long term value. Growth stocks will gener ally be found in fast-growing industries such as technology. Value stocks may be cheap compared to market averages or the company's asset base and may be in a mature industry. Investment house Schroders believes style investment funds will become widely marketed in the UK. It is launching seven funds, and renaming an eighth, offering a choice of growth or value funds in each of four markets: the UK, continental Europe, the US and Japan. The initial charges will be 5.25 per cent, discounted by 2 per cent to 3.25 per cent until 31 January. The annual management charge will be 1.5 per cent. Schroders expects them to be sold mainly through independent advisers. Bungee cover Insurer MRL is aiming to under-cut the competition with a travel policy for the 600,000 young people who go backpacking each year. Prices start at \u00a349 for four months in Europe and \u00a389 for roving worldwide. It covers medical expenses, personal accidents, personal belongings and loss of passport expenses as well as hazardous activities such as bungee jumping and white water rafting. Contact MRL on 08708 450 050. Down Under loans Borrowing with an Australian flavour is promised with the launch in Britain of the Commonwealth bank of Australia at the end of November. It will offer a range of flexible mortgages under the brand name NewWorld. It will offer features not currently found in the UK such as loan portability, product switching between most NewWorld offerings, and borrowers will be able to make their repayments weekly or fortnightly. As an introductory offer owner-occupiers will be offered a discount of 1.24 per cent off the standard vari able rate of 6.99 per cent. There will be no redemption penalties on non-fixed products. Visit NewWorld on mynewworld.com. Cash machine Software from Microsoft aims to save you money by keeping track of your outgoings and helping manage your investments. The company says around a third of people either never know how much money is in their account or end up in the red. Key features of the standard Microsoft Money 2001 package include electronic bill payment and budgeting tools. It costs \u00a329.99. The \u00a349.99 Money 2001 financial suite will count air miles and organise school fee payments. An intriguing What If? feature shows how different scenarios could affect your finances. Want a will? Here's a way More than 1,300 solicitors around Britain are offering their services free of charge in November for people wishing to make a simple will. They will suggest a donation to charity of \u00a350 for a single will and \u00a375 for a couple. The scheme is the latest brainchild of Will Aid, an organisation set up by solicitor Graeme Pagan who took up fundraising in the mid-Eighties as a result of the Ethiopian famine. The money will go to several charities including the Red Cross, Christian Aid and Save the Children. Contact Will Aid on 0870 6060239. Hector's hi-tech fiasco could win you a tax refund Tax advisers are urging taxpayers to see whether they may be eligible for Inland Revenue refunds for 1997-98 following the Government's decision to write off more than 1 million tax records for that tax year. This follows difficulties at the Revenue with the introduction of a new computer system. Some taxpayers will escape tax they owe. Others who may be owed tax will have to make a claim. Among those likely to be affected are people who were employed for part of the year, and who paid tax through PAYE, but then gave up work. If they earned less than that year's personal allowance \u00a34.045, they may be able to claim a refund. Other beneficiaries could be people who gave up jobs to start businesses. Gerry Hart of the Tax Team, says: 'They are entitled to a year's personal allowance against a few months earnings.' Accountant Moore Stephens says non-taxpayers who had tax deducted at source on savings accounts may also have a claim. Advisers said taxpayers who think they might be owed money would have to look up any records of their employment and tax paid during 1997-98 and write to their tax office. Mike Warburton of accountant Grant Thornton said he thought the fiasco might contravene the Taxpayers' Charter which entitled taxpayers to have their affairs settled. Hart pointed out that taxpayers could face heavy penalties for not keeping their own records in order. Scottish strife Thousands of pension investors with Scottish Life are discovering that its takeover by fellow mutual Royal London will not lead to immediate cash windfalls. The flat payments of \u00a3500 being made as part of the deal will not go to individual pension investors. This is because personal pensions and company schemes are run by trustees, and they - in this case, Scottish Life - are the members eligible for the money. However, the insurer will get only one windfall each, not one for each pension customer. Pension investors who have with-profit policies will receive sums estimated to average \u00a33,500, but these will be paid in the form of bonuses in future years. Norwich-based employee benefits consultant Robert Clarke describes the structure of the bonus payouts as 'an outrage' that will line Scottish Life's pockets. The insurer rejects this. A spokesman says it had legal advice that the ownership structure of its pensions did not allow for flat payments to all pension holders. One-off payments to trustees have occurred in previous demutualisations but Scottish Life seems unusual in writing all its personal pensions in a trust. Quicker savings National Savings is introducing bonds with shorter investment terms, and cutting interest rates on the latest issues of all its fixed-rate products by between 0.1 and 0.4 per cent because of falling market rates. Existing customers are not affected. Spokesman Paul Keeble said of the shorter terms: 'People want the flexibility of not having their money tied up for so long.' The pensioners' bond, previously available for two or five years, can now be taken out for just one. It has an AER (annual equivalent rate) of 5.9 per cent. What's the catch?

      "bodyText": "If Al Gore had a coat of arms it ought to have a donkey with a hoof in its mouth as a prominent feature. The US Vice-President is prone to making daft statements about the internet. Rather like our own dear Prime Minister, come to think of it. When the Gore campaign website was first launched some years ago, it briefly included the boast that it was an 'open source' site because it welcomed ideas from visitors. But this was small beer compared with the Vice-President's gaffe about how he 'invented' the internet. 'During my service in the United States Congress,' he declared, 'I took the initiative in creating the internet.' On the face of it, this is patently absurd. The internet was not a better mousetrap that emerged fully formed from the creative imagination of a single individual. It is a complex system that was created by a whole community of scientists and engineers, not an 'invention' in the James Dyson sense of the term. Paul Baran, the chap who first conceived the idea of packet-switching, once likened the project to the building of a cathedral in which successive generations of masons build on the work of their predecessors. 'If you are not careful,' he said afterwards, 'you can con yourself that you did the most important part. But the reality is that each contribution has to follow on from previous work.'

Left to its own devices, the commercial world would never have created such an amazing, permissive, dynamic, open communications system as the net, and society would have been (literally as well as metaphorically) the poorer. The point about Gore is that from the earliest days of his political career he understood this fundamental point - that there are some things that government can and should do because nobody else will. Indeed, that is largely what government is for. In a message recently published on the net, Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn (the guys who laid the foundations of the TCP/IP protocols, which define the modern net) have been pointing out that, as a congressman in the Seventies, Gore promoted the idea of high-speed telecommunications as an engine for both economic growth and the improvement of the US educational system.

She becomes something of an icon to the City while he is still able to shop in Tesco without being recognised. </p> <p>'It's interesting to reflect on the attention given to Lastminute.com, says Professor John Quelch, dean of London Business School (LBS). 'Martha Lane Fox got much more press coverage than Brent Hoberman, which suggests there was something more unique about her in the minds of the media than him. It's a reflection of the problem facing women in business.' </p> <p>The depressing fact is that, despite all the talk of closing gender gaps over the last few years, men still wear the trousers in the business world. The few women like Lane Fox who have made it to the top of the tree are seen as freaks, which serves only to reinforce stereotypes and, ultimately, exacerbate the corporate gender divide. </p> <p>LBS is so concerned at the lack of senior female executives that later this week it will hold a high-profile conference - 'Breaking the Mould' - in an attempt to attract more women to the university and into the business world at large. Only 22 per cent of the school's students are women, reflecting the fact that they form less than a quarter of those who apply. It is a statistic common to business schools nationwide. </p> <p>Quelch says: 'If you take a profession like medicine or the law, you find women have broken through. About 50 per cent of the people in these two are women. Even in engineering women are making headway. But in business...' </p> <p>Indeed. The facts are overly familiar. Only one woman - Marjorie Scardino, chief executive of Pearson - heads a FTSE 100 company. Less than 5 per cent of non-executive positions in those companies are held by women. Last week a comprehensive report into executive pay by the research company Incomes Data Services showed that in this financial year a female FTSE 350 director could expect to receive total earnings - including bonuses and share options - of \u00a3261,000. Her male counterpart, however, would be in line for a package just shy of \u00a3400,000. </p> <p>Even in the US, seen as home to a more enlightened business culture than the old boy network represented in the Square Mile, there seem few grounds for optimism. An exhaustive study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which analysed US salary data between 1992 and 1997, showed that women executives earned one-third less than men over the same period: $900,000 compared with $1.3 million - although the differentials were heavily skewed by disparities in age and experience. Even so, it is still a fact that less than 5 per cent of women reach the most senior executive positions in American companies. </p> <p>But the UK seems to be one of the worst offenders when it comes to top jobs for the boys. Success stories are few and far between. Scardino does, after all, hail from the US. The UK's second highest-profile businesswoman, Barbara Cassani, chief executive of BA's low-cost airline Go, is also from over the pond. A recent edition of Fortune magazine was big on female high-flyers in the US - as you would expect - but it also waxed lyrical about French and Japanese businesswomen. The UK was, with the exception of Scardino, sadly lacking. </p> <p>The entrenched patriarchal structure of the business world might make for a cosy club, but it doesn't make for strong corporate performances, according to Quelch. This is because the new, knowledge-based economy places much greater emphasis on the need to create enduring working relationships between companies. More and more companies are sharing information, brands and personnel, calling for new management skills. </p> <p>'The types of challenges facing businesses today are often about managing joint ventures or strategic partnerships. It's not about being a bull in a china shop like the old days. The competitiveness of the UK economy depends on it leveraging the talents of its people and obviously there are demands for people with these sorts of management skills,' Quelch says. </p> <p>Elizabeth Coffey, author of The Changing Culture of Leadership: Women Leaders' Voices, agrees with Quelch's analysis. She studied 50 of the top businesswomen in the UK and compared their styles of leadership with their male counterparts. </p> <p>'Women are much more into developing learning cultures. They'll create teams rather than divisions and hierarchies,' says Coffey. </p> <p>It might sound New Age mumbo jumbo to the pinstriped brigade but Coffey argues that companies will have to start taking such cultures far more seriously in the future. 'Companies will start to pay more attention to this when they ask \"who are our customers?\" Customers are increasingly female.' </p> <p>Indeed they are, and it's not just in the obvious conventional retail departments that women are making the purchasing decisions. Four-fifths of all car-buying decisions are made or influenced by women. A survey in the US found that nearly 60 per cent of all car tyre purchases were made by women. </p> <p>'Companies need to understand how their customers think. That's a primary driver for setting up these learning cultures, so they know how to react,' Coffey says. </p> <p>The trend to outsourcing is also having an effect. Anna Lloyd, of the Committee of 200, a US society for leading businesswomen, says: 'The market place is demanding a different perspective in relationships. A lot of tasks are now outsourced and consultants are doing everything on the payroll. Managers have to interact differently. The old ways of managing things are changing.' </p> <p>But, even if this argument holds water, few companies so far give it credence. 'There is still a lot of prejudice against women around. Companies are more aware that they need women in senior posts and they may appoint some more, but does that mean they're just token gestures?' asks Bronwyn Curtis, managing director of Bloomberg TV and Radio in Europe. </p> <p>Curtis, who was a few years ago the former chief economist at Japanese bank Nomura - still the only woman to have held such a position at a high-profile finance house - is cynical about the future. 'It [the gender gap] is better than when I started in the City in 1987, but I don't think you'll see drastic changes in the next five years.

      "body": "<p>You'd have to have the sentence-building skills of Arthur Mullard not to score some kind of job in journalism these days. </p> <p>Thanks to the explosion of web-based news sites, there has been an estimated 15 percent rise in jobs for sub-editors and writers. But a series of announcements last week may be a signal that this 'golden age' is drawing to a close. </p> <p>Last Monday, Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corporation, announced a 2.5 per cent cut at New Digital Media, its online media division. NMD, which employed 475 staff before the cuts, will now narrow its focus to national and political news. Reporters covering science and technology are among the first to go. </p> <p>The lay-offs came days after Murdoch cast doubt on the value of the internet in comments made to shareholders. </p> <p>Network of the World (NOW), the interactive entertainment service set up by 'Superboy' Richard Li of Hong Kong, is also facing sharp cutbacks. Parent company Pacific Century Cyberworks told analysts it would reduce investment in the London-based service, which employs 350 staff. </p> <p>So far no details of cuts are available but staff fear the worst. NOW, run by the son of Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing - known as 'Superman' - is a joint venture between Pacific and Trans World, the TV and online production company. </p> <p>In the States, NBC Internet has already announced plans to lay off 20 per cent of its staff, while technology news site Red Herring has cut 25 jobs - around 7 per cent of the workforce. </p> <p>In Britain, the cull hasn't started yet, but it's a matter of time according to Jeremy Dear, national organiser at the National Union of Journalists. 'We still have concerns about how many sites make money. A lot of them hardly get any adverts. They're just pumping money hoping to outlast their competitors,' he said. </p> <p>The warning signs are clear. Journalists lured to websites by the promise of fat stock options following a float have seen those hopes dashed. 'The investment climate is such that floats are pulled or delayed. Last year a lead weight could have floated but investors have been badly burnt and now bankers are asking when a site's business model will make money. That is a nasty, penetrating question to which there is no short answer,' said one senior web journalist. </p> <p>'Options are useless,' said another. 'We were promised that our site was going to float but the climate is not right. There's talk of a year-end bonus now, but it's just talk at this stage.' </p> <p>Accusations are rife within web news sites that they are run as little more than 'sweatshops'. Many say their job is to produce a glorified wire service which reheats press releases and offers little job fulfilment. Stories are often kept to a minimum 300 words, allowing little detail or explanation. </p> <p>'What happens is that all the sites, whether they're music, news, health or finance, look at what each other does in the afternoon and then tweak it at the end of the day. We haven't added much to the sum total of news output,' said one. </p> <p>Nils Pratley, former Daily Telegraph and Sunday Business journalist now editing TheStreet.com, a leading financial news and features site, denies this - up to a point. 'We offer analysis, depth and proper comment. We break more stories than most websites. But in the grand scheme of things, most financial stories break in the FT or in the Sundays. That hasn't changed much. Everyone goes on about web sites reinventing journalism. It's hard. But readers are also interested in readable good analysis.' </p> <p>Certain websites have ridden into a storm over the treatment of freelances. The 365 Corporation, run by television presenter and former Q magazine editor Danny Kelly, earlier this year lost a prominent staff member who resigned in protest at 'stringent' freelance contracts. Pay rates were well below industry rates and journalists had to waive their copyright yet they were were wholly liable in the event of legal action. </p> <p>Negotiations are still taking place over contracts. But at most sites spawned by established publishing houses, union recognition agreements are already in place. </p> <p>'We've no problem at FT.com or at the Beeb's site,' said Dear. 'It's the smaller sites where problems arise. The trouble with web news is that people work incredibly long hours. That happens a lot in the media but more so here where news can be released any time of the day.' </p> <p>Dear said one effect of the the proliferation of web news was a severe shortage of sub-editors on provincial papers. Sub-editors on titles such as the Yorkshire Post earn up to \u00a320,000. Web subs can earn \u00a35,000 more than that - still \u00a310,000 less than wages on a national daily. </p> <p>On trade news websites, where most web journalists are employed, the job can be very frustrating. 'We are at the mercy of technology,' said the editor of a trade-based travel site. 'You can have the best design and be staffed by intelligent writers but if your email doesn't work or your server regularly breaks down, it means nothing. The problem is that too many companies don't invest in good enough technology to run these sites. So they crash.' </p> <p>For all the talk of web news reinventing journalism, the reality is that nothing much has changed. True, there is a greater interface with readers and the ability to correct errors is easier. But only Matt Drudge, the man who broke the Monica Lewinsky scandal in America, has ever achieved a cast-iron web scoop. </p> <p>Not until a web news site does the equivalent of what CNN did to television news journalism can the medium be said to have come of age. And there's little sign of that happening. </p> <p><strong>Com-rades</strong></p> <p>Danny Kelly <br> Danny Kelly, 43, made his name at music title NME, where he was editor before running 'Dad Rock' title, Q. Joined the ranks of dotcom paper millionaires last December when 365 Corporation, the content providing the company he founded, floated.

      "bodyText": "You'd have to have the sentence-building skills of Arthur Mullard not to score some kind of job in journalism these days. Thanks to the explosion of web-based news sites, there has been an estimated 15 percent rise in jobs for sub-editors and writers. But a series of announcements last week may be a signal that this 'golden age' is drawing to a close. Last Monday, Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corporation, announced a 2.5 per cent cut at New Digital Media, its online media division. NMD, which employed 475 staff before the cuts, will now narrow its focus to national and political news. Reporters covering science and technology are among the first to go. The lay-offs came days after Murdoch cast doubt on the value of the internet in comments made to shareholders. Network of the World (NOW), the interactive entertainment service set up by 'Superboy' Richard Li of Hong Kong, is also facing sharp cutbacks. Parent company Pacific Century Cyberworks told analysts it would reduce investment in the London-based service, which employs 350 staff. So far no details of cuts are available but staff fear the worst. NOW, run by the son of Hong Kong's richest man, Li Ka-shing - known as 'Superman' - is a joint venture between Pacific and Trans World, the TV and online production company. In the States, NBC Internet has already announced plans to lay off 20 per cent of its staff, while technology news site Red Herring has cut 25 jobs - around 7 per cent of the workforce. In Britain, the cull hasn't started yet, but it's a matter of time according to Jeremy Dear, national organiser at the National Union of Journalists. 'We still have concerns about how many sites make money. A lot of them hardly get any adverts. They're just pumping money hoping to outlast their competitors,' he said. The warning signs are clear. Journalists lured to websites by the promise of fat stock options following a float have seen those hopes dashed. 'The investment climate is such that floats are pulled or delayed. Last year a lead weight could have floated but investors have been badly burnt and now bankers are asking when a site's business model will make money. That is a nasty, penetrating question to which there is no short answer,' said one senior web journalist. 'Options are useless,' said another. 'We were promised that our site was going to float but the climate is not right. There's talk of a year-end bonus now, but it's just talk at this stage.' Accusations are rife within web news sites that they are run as little more than 'sweatshops'. Many say their job is to produce a glorified wire service which reheats press releases and offers little job fulfilment. Stories are often kept to a minimum 300 words, allowing little detail or explanation. 'What happens is that all the sites, whether they're music, news, health or finance, look at what each other does in the afternoon and then tweak it at the end of the day. We haven't added much to the sum total of news output,' said one. Nils Pratley, former Daily Telegraph and Sunday Business journalist now editing TheStreet.com, a leading financial news and features site, denies this - up to a point. 'We offer analysis, depth and proper comment. We break more stories than most websites. But in the grand scheme of things, most financial stories break in the FT or in the Sundays. That hasn't changed much. Everyone goes on about web sites reinventing journalism. It's hard. But readers are also interested in readable good analysis.' Certain websites have ridden into a storm over the treatment of freelances. The 365 Corporation, run by television presenter and former Q magazine editor Danny Kelly, earlier this year lost a prominent staff member who resigned in protest at 'stringent' freelance contracts. Pay rates were well below industry rates and journalists had to waive their copyright yet they were were wholly liable in the event of legal action. Negotiations are still taking place over contracts. But at most sites spawned by established publishing houses, union recognition agreements are already in place. 'We've no problem at FT.com or at the Beeb's site,' said Dear. 'It's the smaller sites where problems arise. The trouble with web news is that people work incredibly long hours. That happens a lot in the media but more so here where news can be released any time of the day.' Dear said one effect of the the proliferation of web news was a severe shortage of sub-editors on provincial papers. Sub-editors on titles such as the Yorkshire Post earn up to \u00a320,000. Web subs can earn \u00a35,000 more than that - still \u00a310,000 less than wages on a national daily. On trade news websites, where most web journalists are employed, the job can be very frustrating. 'We are at the mercy of technology,' said the editor of a trade-based travel site. 'You can have the best design and be staffed by intelligent writers but if your email doesn't work or your server regularly breaks down, it means nothing. The problem is that too many companies don't invest in good enough technology to run these sites. So they crash.' For all the talk of web news reinventing journalism, the reality is that nothing much has changed. True, there is a greater interface with readers and the ability to correct errors is easier. But only Matt Drudge, the man who broke the Monica Lewinsky scandal in America, has ever achieved a cast-iron web scoop. Not until a web news site does the equivalent of what CNN did to television news journalism can the medium be said to have come of age. And there's little sign of that happening. Com-rades Danny Kelly Danny Kelly, 43, made his name at music title NME, where he was editor before running 'Dad Rock' title, Q. Joined the ranks of dotcom paper millionaires last December when 365 Corporation, the content providing the company he founded, floated. But his paper fortune has dwindled in tandem with 365's stock market performance. Took the opportunity to buy more shares when 365 fell below float price.

      "body": "<p>We all saw the pictures. The deep eye sockets. The streamline features. The gleaming cranium, radiating energy in the glare of his own NBC television lights. We heard the shoot-from-the-hip lingo as he explained how he just snapped together that $45 billion deal between his turbine to twin-tub combine General Electric and industrial controls group Honeywell, in three days. </p> <p>He told us how a tip from a reporter led him to fax Honeywell's chairman nine days' ago and close a deal gazumping his rival United Technologies the following day. As a result of this masterstroke he's putting off his retirement. But, hey, he's taking the risk: his family has only company stock to live on. He's not doing it because he's an old man who can't let go. To anyone who disagrees, he says: 'I want to take them on right in the chops'. </p> <p>How do you describe a man like Jack Welch? 'A dynamo,' says one expert. 'A connoisseur of talent,' says another. </p> <p>'We call him The Penguin,' says one less enamoured engineering firm that has to compete with him rather than lecture about him. 'Tell me if he does not look like Batman's biggest headache. The problem is he has that effect on the competition.' </p> <p>Welch unnerves people. One official at aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce says: 'One of our executives once asked Jack at a conference what he though Rolls should do. 'Just stay in big engines,' he said. 'Our people spent a while puzzling out whether this was good advice, or if he was trying to get one over on us.' </p> <p>He unnerves for a reason. Though he talks macho, synergies with Honeywell worth $1.5 billion were 'right in the gunsights' - he delivers. </p> <p>General Electric is the first and last word in conglomerates. He has built it from the $13bn company he took over in 1981 into the world's biggest company, worth $530 billion. </p> <p>It has 340,000 employees - 465,000 after the latest merger - in 100 countries, with revenues of $111.6 bn. It sells everything from light bulbs to dishwashers and ovens, to electrical switchgear, aero engines and financial services. </p> <p>At 64, Welch's raw energy remains famous. One of his better known sobriquets is Neutron Jack - a phrase that gets close to the heart of the man: he destroys whatever gets in the way of what he wants to build. He is charismatic and competitive and has great charm, according to those who have met him. He has judgment - GE is as much about successful delegation as it is about Welch himself - and he is canny. </p> <p>'All that nonsense about him depending on the success of the deal,' says another competitor. 'He has been getting millions in bonuses. But it's typical Welch: he knows some people will believe it, and he knows they think he does.' Welch is the eighth highest paid US executive, says Forbes magazine . </p> <p>His upbringing is suspiciously close to the ideal American dream, an idea the old myth-maker does little to discourage. For example, a converted gravel pit in his native Salem, Massachusetts - requisitioned by local boys who ran it themselves because there were no state leisure facilities - was where his first fist fights and ball games were played out. Naturally, he rose to the top. </p> <p>But for the record, he was born the only son of a railway conductor. His father was often away from home so he was raised by his ambitious mother. </p> <p>Welch was not shy about ambition himself. He had an accomplished spell at Salem High school, where he was co-captain of golf - he is still very keen - played hockey, and held the post of treasurer. </p> <p>His teachers said in his college yearbook: 'A keen wit, a wise look and an answer always ready.' Welch said in the school literary magazine: 'repressed desire - to make a million.' </p> <p>He went to the University of Massachusetts for a degree in chemical engineering, followed by a Phd at the University of Illinois. </p> <p>He joined GE's plastics division in 1960. Plastics was a buzzing area, with new markets being developed. His career has perhaps come full circle. With the acquisition of Honeywell, GE's $250m plastics division gains critical mass. </p> <p>'Back then,' says one business analyst, 'he learnt you have to innovate ceaselessly to get margins.' </p> <p>Welch sped through GE. By 1981 he was joint chief executive and chairman. Jay Conger, professor of leadership at the London Business School, says one of the keys to Welch was spotting defining new trends and remodelling the business around them. 'Control your destiny or die,' he said. </p> <p>His first initiative was to force the company's operations to focus at being number one or number two in its market. If it wasn't it had to get there. If it couldn't, it would go. This not only refocused the business - hundreds of underperforming operations went - it refocused management and weeded out those who weren't up to scratch. </p> <p>He called his next move 'speed, simplicity, self confidence'. Welch viewed the GE bureaucracy - an industrial civil service - with suspicion. So he smashed it, gaining that Neutron Jack tag. He thinned out divisions, fired thousands of staff, shed layers of management. Each division would be a business 'laboratory', creating ideas and deciding the best way of making money from them. </p> <p>Late in the Eighties Welch latched onto globalisation, which he called 'boundarylessness'. GE needed to think globally about everything from labour markets, suppliers and customers to business practice, generating its own ideas and taking them from others. </p> <p>On top of this it created businesses such as a leasing and financial services division, which made its own products such as aero-engines more easily available. This division now generates $55.75bn of revenue. He realised margins were in servicing engines, not manufacturing them, so bought independent aero engine workshops around the world. </p> <p>GE has faced challenges throughout - such as the Kidder Peabody financial scandal, which saw a rogue trader lose the financial services arm millions - and some observers have criticised the increasing dominance of financial services. But to his admirers, Welch's success has depended on meeting problems, such as the internet, head on. His response to that? 'destroyyourbusiness.com', an initiative to show top managers that the Net was do or die for GE. The group claims it has already gained $5bn from online operations. </p> <p>He has faced criticism for it. Last year, for example, Forbes hinted that Welch might be a dinosaur thrashing about in a new age when he refused to link the pay of young webmeisters he had brought in to the profits of their operations. The young things began to defect to dotcoms. Welch was allegedly furious - but who's laughing now? </p> <p>For Jay Conger there's more to Welch than the corporate engineer. 'Jack Welch is one of the great dealmakers. People know they are facing the quickest mind in business. But there is more than that - they know they are dealing with one of the world's only business celebrities. Welch knows he's going to do a good deal for GE, and so do they.' Thus far it seems self fulfilling - the 1,700 acquisitions under Welch have created GE as a savvy and agile conglomerate. </p> <p>There are sceptics, particularly over Honeywell. One UK analyst says: 'This could be the mark of an organisation looking for places for its capital. The big question isn't whether Honeywell's a great fit - it isn't perfect - but whether it indicates GE running out of steam. Was it the big man's last gambit?' </p> <p>Honeywell will almost certainly be his swan song. True to form he has managed his succession - picking candidates and designing the selection process. But will he choose the right man? And has he left a structure that they can build on? </p> <p>'You wait to see what comes out of the woodwork when he's gone,' says another analyst. 'There's a lesson from the UK. Remember that famously autocratic and successful British boss Lord Weinstock. Do you remember what his company was called?' </p> <p>Answers on a postcard. </p> <p><strong>Vital signs</strong></p> <p><strong> Subject: </strong> John F Welch Jr </p> <p><strong> Age: </strong> 64 </p> <p><strong> Job: </strong> Chairman and chief executive, General Electric </p> <p><strong> Hobbies: </strong> Golf, baseball, competing </p> <p><strong>Sayings of chairman Jack</strong></p> <p>'We will only be number one or two or else we will sell it, fix it or close it.' </p> <p>'Companies can't give job security. Only customers can.' </p> <p>'Muscle is the answer. When you have 10 diverse businesses, you have 10 popgun stalls. When they are constructed into one entity that can really do the job, that gives you muscle.' </p> <p><strong>Anatomy of a giant</strong></p> <p>Jack Welch may seem like a big deal, but even his stature is dwarfed by the company he runs. General Electric is an American industrial institution. Its origins go back to the 1878 foundation of the Edison Electric company, which turned into GE in 1892. The company history reads like a chronicle of US industrial progress. </p> <p>Between 1882 and 1968 it built the US's first central power station, launched its domestic appliance company, created the RCA radio corporation, entered commercial aircraft engine manufacture, opened the first licensed nuclear power plant and pioneered consumer, commercial and industrial credit and leasing. </p> <p>But while the company's life blood has been building industrial businesses across many sectors of US business, its brains, particularly since Welch became a vice president in the Seventies, have been deployed as one of the country's most astute corporate operators. </p> <p>Under Welch GE has become a deal-making machine - to the tune of some 1,700 acquisitions. Indeed, Welch cited his skills at bedding in deals, particularly the 1985 acquisition of the RCA media business, as the main reason for staying on. </p> <p>In 1981 GE moved into semiconductors, buying Intercil. In 1983 it consolidated its position in medical scanning technology through acquisition. </p> <p>A string of deals since then has built GE Capital Services into a massive consumer credit, industrial and commercial financing and leasing operation which dominates the business - some would say too much so. </p> <p>Welch has also pursued other strategies by acquisition, for example backing his belief in the margins of servicing rather than building aero-engines by buying BA's operations in Wales in 1991 and Greenwich Air services and UNC in 1997. </p> <p>He's also bought into mobile phones - a joint venture with Ericsson in 1991 - and snapped up operations that fit with the companies earliest origins, such as Thorn EMI's light bulb business in 1991. </p> <p>He has also jettisoned extraneous operations, such as non financial broadcasting, oil and gas exploration and problematic operations such as Kidder Peabody financial business. </p> <p>One disposal, made in 1970 when he had been at the company 10 years, may have caught his eye. In that year GE sold its mainframe computer business to Honeywell. Last week's deal brings the business back to GE. </p> <p>But the world is split over whether Jack's done well on this one. Initial reaction from the markets was twitchy - GE's value dropped by about 4.8 per cent. </p> <p>Analysts rallied, however, pointing to the strategic fit in aerospace, where GE's $10.6 billion of aero engine sales was matched by Honeywell's $10.5 billion cockpit avionics business. They also pointed to a broader customer base for GE's industrial systems brought by Honeywell's controls division. </p> <p>Welch himself defended the acquisition of the chemicals business, saying it bulked GE's $250m activities up by $1bn. </p> <p>He added that these are real technology businesses, with real earnings and real products - unlike the dotcoms - and pointed to real $1.5bn savings from the '90 per cent fit' of the businesses. </p> <p>In a Merrill Lynch note out on Wednesday analyst Jeanne Terrile says if GE successfully integrates Honeywell it could be the driver of GE's future growth when other businesses, like power, turn down. </p> <p>But the note is in awe of Welch: 'Fixing Honeywell will call upon a lot of GE's resources, but... GE has done this sort of thing before,' Terrile wrote.' She added: 'The deal seems so much (a) a Jack deal... and (b) will be the thing that investors focus on until it is done... that the succession story becomes much smaller.' </p> <p>With 3,000 miles perspective, UK analysts are not so sure. ABN Amro's Sandy Morris said: 'There are \"yesses\" about this. Perhaps Honeywell's automation will allow GE to develop its home products division, for example with fridges that can read barcodes and so on. But nobody has ever demonstrated to me that cockpits (Honeywell's Avionics) and engines (GE) have natural synergies. I'm sure if they had, people would have tried it. </p> <p>'That said, GE is a phenomenally powerful company with a phenomenal growth record. The question is, is this the best thing it can find to do with its capital, or is it a sign that the momentum is finally beginning to go?'</p>",

When they are constructed into one entity that can really do the job, that gives you muscle.' Anatomy of a giant Jack Welch may seem like a big deal, but even his stature is dwarfed by the company he runs. General Electric is an American industrial institution. Its origins go back to the 1878 foundation of the Edison Electric company, which turned into GE in 1892. The company history reads like a chronicle of US industrial progress. Between 1882 and 1968 it built the US's first central power station, launched its domestic appliance company, created the RCA radio corporation, entered commercial aircraft engine manufacture, opened the first licensed nuclear power plant and pioneered consumer, commercial and industrial credit and leasing. But while the company's life blood has been building industrial businesses across many sectors of US business, its brains, particularly since Welch became a vice president in the Seventies, have been deployed as one of the country's most astute corporate operators. Under Welch GE has become a deal-making machine - to the tune of some 1,700 acquisitions. Indeed, Welch cited his skills at bedding in deals, particularly the 1985 acquisition of the RCA media business, as the main reason for staying on. In 1981 GE moved into semiconductors, buying Intercil. In 1983 it consolidated its position in medical scanning technology through acquisition. A string of deals since then has built GE Capital Services into a massive consumer credit, industrial and commercial financing and leasing operation which dominates the business - some would say too much so. Welch has also pursued other strategies by acquisition, for example backing his belief in the margins of servicing rather than building aero-engines by buying BA's operations in Wales in 1991 and Greenwich Air services and UNC in 1997. He's also bought into mobile phones - a joint venture with Ericsson in 1991 - and snapped up operations that fit with the companies earliest origins, such as Thorn EMI's light bulb business in 1991. He has also jettisoned extraneous operations, such as non financial broadcasting, oil and gas exploration and problematic operations such as Kidder Peabody financial business. One disposal, made in 1970 when he had been at the company 10 years, may have caught his eye. In that year GE sold its mainframe computer business to Honeywell. Last week's deal brings the business back to GE. But the world is split over whether Jack's done well on this one. Initial reaction from the markets was twitchy - GE's value dropped by about 4.8 per cent. Analysts rallied, however, pointing to the strategic fit in aerospace, where GE's $10.6 billion of aero engine sales was matched by Honeywell's $10.5 billion cockpit avionics business. They also pointed to a broader customer base for GE's industrial systems brought by Honeywell's controls division. Welch himself defended the acquisition of the chemicals business, saying it bulked GE's $250m activities up by $1bn. He added that these are real technology businesses, with real earnings and real products - unlike the dotcoms - and pointed to real $1.5bn savings from the '90 per cent fit' of the businesses. In a Merrill Lynch note out on Wednesday analyst Jeanne Terrile says if GE successfully integrates Honeywell it could be the driver of GE's future growth when other businesses, like power, turn down. But the note is in awe of Welch: 'Fixing Honeywell will call upon a lot of GE's resources, but... GE has done this sort of thing before,' Terrile wrote.' She added: 'The deal seems so much (a) a Jack deal... and (b) will be the thing that investors focus on until it is done... that the succession story becomes much smaller.' With 3,000 miles perspective, UK analysts are not so sure. ABN Amro's Sandy Morris said: 'There are \"yesses\" about this. Perhaps Honeywell's automation will allow GE to develop its home products division, for example with fridges that can read barcodes and so on. But nobody has ever demonstrated to me that cockpits (Honeywell's Avionics) and engines (GE) have natural synergies. I'm sure if they had, people would have tried it. 'That said, GE is a phenomenally powerful company with a phenomenal growth record. The question is, is this the best thing it can find to do with its capital, or is it a sign that the momentum is finally beginning to go?'",

Many of them have come together in the Government's rail summits to make declarations of unity and debate issues of performance. But it took the Hatfield crash 12 days ago to force them to sit down and work out how to run a railway that is safe and can perform well. The Government has ordered an investigation into whether profit is being put before safety in the industry - not wilfully but by default because of flaws in the contractual relationships drawn up for privatisation. Hatfield is already seen as a watershed in the short history of the privatised railway. It took a single broken rail to expose the failure in the chain of command running through the fragmented industry. The Government will not tear up the entire structure, or take a stake in Railtrack, but it has ordered an investigation into all the contractual relationships between the main players. Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority, has been asked by John Prescott, Deputy Prime Minister, specifically to look at whether the commercial regime is fundamentally in conflict with putting safety first.

A senior industry source told The Observer this weekend that the problem in the chain of command between network owner and maintenance company went from the top of Railtrack right down to the man on the ground working on the tracks for Balfour Beatty. 'What we have is an instance of a very significant failure in the competence of the management of the network,' he said. Railtrack has been asked to give rail regulator Tom Winsor a 'remedial plan', showing how it will return the network to normal as soon as possible after carrying out emergency works on potentially dangerous areas of track that it should have known about and dealt with long ago.

Early evidence from the Hatfield investigation, revealed to The Observer, suggests Balfour Beatty had told Railtrack the line that broke near Hatfield was dangerous but that Railtrack failed to impose a speed limit or close the track. This was not an isolated example. That is seen as a failure of management and of Railtrack's contracts with maintenance firms, in many cases, not being designed to cater for a passenger and freight boom.

Passengers were promised a privatised railway that would be safe, punctual and good value for money, with new trains and higher speeds.

It also depends on how effectively the industry structure is reorganised by rail regulator Tom Winsor and Sir Alastair Morton, chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority. It is widely agreed that the system is badly in need of reforms that were already under way before Hatfield, and are now likely to be intensified. </p> <p>One stark demonstrationof the problem is that the public is constantly being told of record levels of investment in the industry but what they see is a network falling apart. So where does all the money go? </p> <p>Railtrack's latest annual report boasts: 'The scale of our investment has been transformed over the past four years, with almost \u00a32 billion invested last year - over twice the level we achieved three years ago.' </p> <p>Two thirds of this was spent on basic maintenance and repairing or renewing worn-out equipment - including track, signalling, bridges and stations. Around 22 per cent was spend on expanding capacity on the network and new 'enhancement' projects, and 13 per cent was spent on the first stage of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. </p> <p>Last week Winsor announced his review of Railtrack's finances for the five years from next April. Railtrack's finances are regulated because as a privatised monopoly it receives fixed amounts of revenue from the train operators, subsidised by \u00a31.3bn a year of taxpayers' money. Railtrack's spending will go up to \u00a315bn for the new five-year period, compared with \u00a310bn last time: most of the money comes from pre-determined and subsidised charges paid by the train operators for access to the tracks. The figure has also been increased by \u00a3855m from the provisional amount decided by Winsor in July. </p> <p>This extra \u00a3855m will come as a direct grant out of the \u00a360bn announced for the railways by the Government in the summer as part of its \u00a3180bn 10-year transport spending plans. </p> <p>Public spending on the railways as a whole is set to rise from \u00a31.6bn this year to \u00a34bn by 2006 - proof that one of the primary aims of privatisation, that of unburdening the public purse, has failed. And there is a grave risk that without effective reforms, much of the money will be wasted: not just in the high-profile dividends to shareholders and bonus payments to executives that cause such an outcry among the general public, but purely in terms of how much of Railtrack's spending actually produces the desired result. </p> <p>Consultancy Booz Allen Hamilton reported to the rail regulator in 1999 that Railtrack's project management and spending efficiencies often led to projects going over budget and money being wasted on bureaucracy and an inefficient chain of companies subcontracted to carry out work. In relation to the company's plans to refurbish stations, the report said: 'Serious problems remain, with a \"\u00a3 in the ground\" indicator suggesting that physical works represent less than 50 per cent of project expenditure. Railtrack's project management processes may be adding up to 20 per cent to delivery costs.' </p> <p>News that the company was wasting 50p in every \u00a31 on invisible overheads enraged the regulator. </p> <p>Booz Allen also reported that 10 per cent of the network's 20,000 miles of track were in either poor or very poor condition, and the nation's infrastructure was in a worse state than when Railtrack was hived off from British Rail in 1994. </p> <p>Despite tightening up on project management, driving down costs on contracts and keeping a closer watch on its contractors and their myriad sub-contractors, Railtrack has not solved its problems. </p> <p>At one end of the portfolio, its biggest project - to modernise the West Coast Main Line - has been subject to delay, and the cost involved rose from \u00a32.3bn to \u00a35.8bn after the company realised it would have to renew all the lineside signalling on the routes from London to Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow. It had intended simply to remove the existing signals and install an automatic system, but will now have to have both operating alongside each other for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>With work now going on apace, there have been patches of huge disruption at London's Euston station this year: sub-contractors would cut through the wrong cables or overran working schedules, often bringing the passenger railway to a halt. </p> <p>At the most basic end of its portfolio, Railtrack has been slated for failing to repair broken and cracked rails fast enough and failing to replace sleepers and stone ballast. The company is on its third attempt to draw up a database of its assets after it was revealed that it did not have a register of the condition, capacity and capability of the network it owns. </p> <p>There were 755 broken rails on the network in the year to March 1998 but this number rose to 952 the following year. The total of 917 in the year to this spring exceeded Railtrack's first forecast of 770, and its revised forecast of 870. </p> <p>Winsor decided in August that this was prima facie evidence of a breach of the central condition of its licence - that the company maintain the network properly. He appointed an independent consultancy from the US, TCCI, to carry out an audit. In a report due to be published on Friday the TCCI team is expected to criticise Railtrack's relationship with its contractors, which has led to vital repairs on the network being neglected or delayed, and saw it embroiled in rows about who is responsible and who should pay. </p> <p>After the Hatfield crash there was claim and counter-claim that Balfour Beatty had warned Railtrack last year that track in the area was worn and that, in turn, the rail company had warned its contractor that it was not carrying out maintenance work properly. </p> <p>A fresh piece of track had been sitting next to a worn section of track at Hatfield on the East Coast Main Line since May, waiting to be fitted by renewal contractor Jarvis. But the train operators are so keen to run their record numbers of trains that Railtrack had had difficulty getting them to agree to close off track for repairs. </p> <p>After a privatisation and regulation process that Winsor has criticised as 'cutting corners' and leaving too much to the discretion of Railtrack and the train operators, he and Morton are busy rewriting the contracts that underpin the labyrinth of relationships in the industry. </p> <p>Morton is redrawing the map of passenger franchises, and last week stripped Connex of its London South Central franchise. </p> <p>Winsor is tightening up Railtrack's licensing conditions to leave less scope for waste and incompetence in its engineering work and more 'sticks and carrots' to ensure it spends more to renew the railway faster. </p> <p>Winsor is not expected to recommend to the Government that it removes Railtrack's licence because, as it is a monopoly, there is no one else readily available to run the network. </p> <p>The Government will not renationalise the railways, and it is understood to be highly unlikely to take a token stake in Railtrack, because that would give it little extra power over the company while opening it up to blame whenever anything goes wrong. </p> <p>Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott prefers to rely on Winsor and Morton, the two men he personally appointed to shake up the railways, to bring greater accountability, responsibility and investment into the industry. </p> <p>That means more of Railtrack's pounds going in the ground more quickly so that the taxpayer can at last get a decent ride - both safe and punctual - on a railway for which it is paying through the nose.</p>",

With work now going on apace, there have been patches of huge disruption at London's Euston station this year: sub-contractors would cut through the wrong cables or overran working schedules, often bringing the passenger railway to a halt. At the most basic end of its portfolio, Railtrack has been slated for failing to repair broken and cracked rails fast enough and failing to replace sleepers and stone ballast. The company is on its third attempt to draw up a database of its assets after it was revealed that it did not have a register of the condition, capacity and capability of the network it owns. There were 755 broken rails on the network in the year to March 1998 but this number rose to 952 the following year. The total of 917 in the year to this spring exceeded Railtrack's first forecast of 770, and its revised forecast of 870. Winsor decided in August that this was prima facie evidence of a breach of the central condition of its licence - that the company maintain the network properly. He appointed an independent consultancy from the US, TCCI, to carry out an audit. In a report due to be published on Friday the TCCI team is expected to criticise Railtrack's relationship with its contractors, which has led to vital repairs on the network being neglected or delayed, and saw it embroiled in rows about who is responsible and who should pay. After the Hatfield crash there was claim and counter-claim that Balfour Beatty had warned Railtrack last year that track in the area was worn and that, in turn, the rail company had warned its contractor that it was not carrying out maintenance work properly. A fresh piece of track had been sitting next to a worn section of track at Hatfield on the East Coast Main Line since May, waiting to be fitted by renewal contractor Jarvis. But the train operators are so keen to run their record numbers of trains that Railtrack had had difficulty getting them to agree to close off track for repairs. After a privatisation and regulation process that Winsor has criticised as 'cutting corners' and leaving too much to the discretion of Railtrack and the train operators, he and Morton are busy rewriting the contracts that underpin the labyrinth of relationships in the industry. Morton is redrawing the map of passenger franchises, and last week stripped Connex of its London South Central franchise. Winsor is tightening up Railtrack's licensing conditions to leave less scope for waste and incompetence in its engineering work and more 'sticks and carrots' to ensure it spends more to renew the railway faster. Winsor is not expected to recommend to the Government that it removes Railtrack's licence because, as it is a monopoly, there is no one else readily available to run the network. The Government will not renationalise the railways, and it is understood to be highly unlikely to take a token stake in Railtrack, because that would give it little extra power over the company while opening it up to blame whenever anything goes wrong. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott prefers to rely on Winsor and Morton, the two men he personally appointed to shake up the railways, to bring greater accountability, responsibility and investment into the industry. That means more of Railtrack's pounds going in the ground more quickly so that the taxpayer can at last get a decent ride - both safe and punctual - on a railway for which it is paying through the nose.",

It is about nothing more than privatisation'. </p> <p>At the meeting he announced that within a year Boeing planned to unveil a satellite-based scheme capable of total overhaul of air traffic control, managing it more efficiently than the current radar/satellite hybrids operating around the world and creating 50 per cent more space. The project would take five years before it could be rolled out. It will cost between $10bn and $20bn, of which Boeing is prepared to foot a significant proportion. </p> <p>The fundamental difference between satellite and radar is this: radar tracks from the ground, plotting accurately an aircraft's progress on to a screen every three seconds or so. Satellites rely on the plane sending them signals before relaying them to the controller's screen. </p> <p>Satellite, which is already in use through the US government's military GPS system where radar is uneconomic and impractical, are potentially quicker and more accurate than radar - allowing more planes to fly. </p> <p>A next-generation system would initially run on GPS satellites but would eventually need a dedicated fleet of new-generation satellites capable of greater accuracy and predictive power, since plotting an aircraft's future course is as vital as knowing where it is now. </p> <p>GPS can place aircraft to within 7 metres of their position.

To make the personal adviser model profitable in Europe, Warburg will raise the minimum investment required to $500,000. The e-services programme was aimed at those with at least $100,000 to invest. Other banks with 'mass affluent' internet projects in the pipeline are Credit Suisse and HSBC in conjunction with Merrill Lynch.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>You know the business world is weird when the makers of Wonderbra want to buy Bernard Matthews, the poultry food producer. </p> <p>But next week, expect the first salvos in what could be a vicious battle for the soul of one of Norfolk's biggest and most famous firms. </p> <p>Giant US conglomerate, Sara Lee is likely to bid for Bernard Matthews. And the battle could be grisly. </p> <p>Matthews, the 70-year-old who brought turkeys to the masses and coined the phrase 'bootiful', last week announced plans to take his firm private. Those close to him insist he would resist all moves to rip the company from his grasp. </p> <p>Bernard Matthews is seen as one of the naffest companies in Britain. Any firm in the business of killing animals is never going to be regarded as sexy. And everyone dislikes the 'bootiful' catchphrase. Even the man himself is embarrassed by it. What's more, its turkey burgers, cooked meats and birds for roasting are the fare of students and those on low incomes. </p> <p>But in the midst of the biggest farming crisis to hit Britain for generations, Matthews is thriving.Never mind that sterling's strength against the euro has made life intolerable for British farmers. Matthews vies with Bird's Eye to dominate the \u00a3600 million frozen poultry market, has more than 50 per cent of the \u00a3300m cold-cooked poultry meat market and is making serious inroads into fresh turkey meat and breaded poultry products. </p> <p>While his core market is Britain, he is beginning to spread his wings overseas - a notoriously tricky thing to pull off for UK food producers and retailers. Matthews is selling to Germany, New Zealand and, most crucially, Hungary, where he rears vast numbers of birds and which is proving to be a lucrative market. It eventually will be a launch pad for an assault on what could be a profitable eastern European market. </p> <p>For Sara Lee, buying Bernard Matthews makes sense. OK, it makes Pretty Polly tights, Radox, Brylcream and Douwe Egbert coffee. But it is also the world's biggest processed-meat producer. A bid for Matthews would cement its dominant position and give it the opportunity to drive into Europe. </p> <p>Matthews and Sara Lee's chairman and chief executive, John Bryan, go back years. In fact Sara Lee bought the technology that rips out the poultry's innards from Matthews 10 years ago. </p> <p>For some time Bryan has coveted Matthews' business. Next week he will strike. For Bryan, this deal will be chicken feed. His firm generates revenues of more than \u00a310 billion, compared with Matthews' turnover of \u00a3344m. </p> <p>But if Bryan is to succeed, he will have to pay a high price. Matthews' offer to shareholders to take his firm private is 185p per share. There is every indication that 13 per cent of shareholders are happy with that price. With Matthews owning more than 40 per cent of share capital, he is in a strong position. </p> <p>But there are several who think Matthews' offer is too low. They are eagerly expecting a Sara Lee bid weighing in at over 230p. </p> <p>Matthews' institutional backers include some of the bluest blue chips around: the likes of Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch , Fidelity and M&amp;G, whose shares have leapt in value since its original investment. </p> <p>While these institutions are not entirely happy with Matthews' offer, they know that Matthews himself has to be prepared to sell in order for Sara Lee to triumph. In which case a bid of 250p a share valuing Bernard Matthews at about \u00a3310m is a price he may be prepared to accept. </p> <p>If Matthews decides to reject Sara Lee the future direction of the company would be unclear. </p> <p>None of Matthews' children has seemingly any interest or experience in food production.

      "bodyText": "You know the business world is weird when the makers of Wonderbra want to buy Bernard Matthews, the poultry food producer. But next week, expect the first salvos in what could be a vicious battle for the soul of one of Norfolk's biggest and most famous firms. Giant US conglomerate, Sara Lee is likely to bid for Bernard Matthews. And the battle could be grisly. Matthews, the 70-year-old who brought turkeys to the masses and coined the phrase 'bootiful', last week announced plans to take his firm private. Those close to him insist he would resist all moves to rip the company from his grasp. Bernard Matthews is seen as one of the naffest companies in Britain. Any firm in the business of killing animals is never going to be regarded as sexy. And everyone dislikes the 'bootiful' catchphrase. Even the man himself is embarrassed by it. What's more, its turkey burgers, cooked meats and birds for roasting are the fare of students and those on low incomes. But in the midst of the biggest farming crisis to hit Britain for generations, Matthews is thriving.Never mind that sterling's strength against the euro has made life intolerable for British farmers. Matthews vies with Bird's Eye to dominate the \u00a3600 million frozen poultry market, has more than 50 per cent of the \u00a3300m cold-cooked poultry meat market and is making serious inroads into fresh turkey meat and breaded poultry products. While his core market is Britain, he is beginning to spread his wings overseas - a notoriously tricky thing to pull off for UK food producers and retailers. Matthews is selling to Germany, New Zealand and, most crucially, Hungary, where he rears vast numbers of birds and which is proving to be a lucrative market. It eventually will be a launch pad for an assault on what could be a profitable eastern European market. For Sara Lee, buying Bernard Matthews makes sense. OK, it makes Pretty Polly tights, Radox, Brylcream and Douwe Egbert coffee. But it is also the world's biggest processed-meat producer. A bid for Matthews would cement its dominant position and give it the opportunity to drive into Europe. Matthews and Sara Lee's chairman and chief executive, John Bryan, go back years. In fact Sara Lee bought the technology that rips out the poultry's innards from Matthews 10 years ago. For some time Bryan has coveted Matthews' business. Next week he will strike. For Bryan, this deal will be chicken feed. His firm generates revenues of more than \u00a310 billion, compared with Matthews' turnover of \u00a3344m. But if Bryan is to succeed, he will have to pay a high price. Matthews' offer to shareholders to take his firm private is 185p per share. There is every indication that 13 per cent of shareholders are happy with that price. With Matthews owning more than 40 per cent of share capital, he is in a strong position. But there are several who think Matthews' offer is too low. They are eagerly expecting a Sara Lee bid weighing in at over 230p. Matthews' institutional backers include some of the bluest blue chips around: the likes of Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch , Fidelity and M&amp;G, whose shares have leapt in value since its original investment. While these institutions are not entirely happy with Matthews' offer, they know that Matthews himself has to be prepared to sell in order for Sara Lee to triumph. In which case a bid of 250p a share valuing Bernard Matthews at about \u00a3310m is a price he may be prepared to accept. If Matthews decides to reject Sara Lee the future direction of the company would be unclear. None of Matthews' children has seemingly any interest or experience in food production. And he is not getting any younger. Two years ago, he suffered from ill health and, while those close to him say he is now fit, the bid to take the company is seen as a sign that he wants to tidy up his affairs. But there is always the possibility that Matthews, who started his company in 1950 with 20 turkey eggs and an incubator for \u00a32.50, is playing a cute game. Knowing that Sara Lee has always been interested in his firm, a bid to take it private could flush out a fantastic offer giving his dependants a fat inheritance. Bootiful!",

Over the past decade, the UK topped the European league of worker effort. </p> <p>'During the Thatcher years, manufacturing work intensified and this seemed to be linked with high productivity increases, despite the fact there was little investment,' Green says.

O'Mahony says: 'Compared with Germany and France, it is an investment story - we have consistently invested less in capital equipment.' </p> <p>Productivity growth has been seen as the holy grail of current economic policy. Where once industrial policy involved picking winning industries, like automotive, shipbuilding and steel, or sustaining failing, but politically important sectors, it now focuses rigidly on increasing productivity. </p> <p>Whichever Treasury policy initiative you examine, the productivity mantra can be found: controversial public-private partnerships for the provision of public services, to the myriad retraining schemes and tax breaks for hi-tech investment. The intention of all these schemes is to increase the efficiency, competitiveness and, ultimately, the productive capacity of the economy. </p> <p>But the UK is still anxiously waiting for lift-off. And for a Government that attaches so much importance to increasing productivity, the stubborn absence of an upturn is a matter of deep concern. </p> <p>History shows there is no simple way of achieving this. In the early 1980s it was fashionable to say that the Thatcher labour reforms - watering down workplace rights and clamping down on the unions - could solve the problem. But the argument now favoured by this Government is that such an approach ignored the need to improve and invest in the skills of the workforce. As O'Mahony says: 'The things that matter, such as R&amp;D, capital investment and skills, are factors that take a long time to change.' </p> <p>Private investment is another key area. Venture capital is the petrol of high productivity industries. The conservative attitude displayed by pension funds towards investing in emerging sectors is under particular scrutiny, namely the explanation for why they put 0.5 per cent of their investments into venture capital compared to 5 per cent in the US. </p> <p>For manufacturing, however, the productivity question is a drop in the ocean in terms of our international competitiveness compared with the high pound. </p> <p>'The UK couldn't really have a productivity gain big enough to offset the effect of the strong pound,' says Alison Cottrell, economist at Paine Webber. </p> <p>But, conversely, the strength of sterling may help lick UK companies into shape. Last week's announcement of an export surplus with the European Union provides evidence that companies are finding ways to compete. </p> <p>'The high pound has made productivity even more important for the UK. The strong yen for many years during the 1980s forced Japanese companies to keep on innovating,' says Cottrell. </p> <p>But some express fears that the strong pound could end up scaring inward investment away, thereby hitting productivity. Recent research by the NIESR found that foreign-owned firms have 'a significant positive effect on the level of technical efficiency in domestic firms'. </p> <p>Investment is the key in the medium- and long-term. In the UK's main hi-tech cluster, Silicon Fen, a neglected public infrastructure threatens to put the breaks on growth. Equally worrying is the negativity of investment intentions in the private sector. Despite seven years of macroeconomic stability, a luxury which should encourage forward-looking investment behaviour, a recent CBI survey predicted a fall in manufacturing investment of 8.8 per cent this year, on top of last year's 13.6 per cent drop. </p> <p>The Chancellor has already granted research and development (R&amp;D) tax credits to small companies. The larger companies that actually carry out most of the R&amp;D will be eagerly awaiting similar concessions to encourage investment. Otherwise Brown's productivity roadshow may have to go on indefinitely. </p> <p><strong>Vital Statistics</strong></p> <p>The UK's low productivity may be solved with considerably less effort than expected - by altering the statistics. But this may not be the quick fix that it sounds. Productivity figures for service industries are notoriously difficult to measure, and this sector has become more important. And the IT revolution has contributed a whole new set of measurement problems. </p> <p>In the US, statistics are adjusted to take account of the rapid changes in the quality of computers. Such adjustments, known as hedonics, are the cause of considerable controversy in economic circles. Some argue that they overstate US output and productivity growth. Goldman Sachs economists David Walton and Ben Broadbent calculated that making hedonic adjustments would add up to 0.5 per cent a year to UK productivity growth since 1995. </p> <p>The quality of data is another issue. 'The US is very good at producing numbers on time, and in Europe there's not the same confidence invested in the data, they often come late,' says one banker. </p> <p>Markets place a lot more faith in the US figures.

Conservative trade and industry spokesman David Heathcoat-Amory believes construction of up to eight new-generation pressurised water reactors - the technology used in Britain's most modern plant at Sizewell B in Suffolk - should be considered as a possible solution to Britain's energy problems. Heathcoat-Amory, a former Energy Minister, was due to unveil the new policy at a Commons debate tomorrow on the Government's public-private partnership proposals for British Nuclear Fuels. That debate has been postponed, but Nick Gibb, junior Conservative DTI spokesman, intends to argue the case in the rescheduled debate later this month. It will be the first time a major political party has seriously put forward the construction of nuclear power stations since the idea for a third reactor at Sizewell was abandoned in the early Nineties.

Last Sunday on <strong> Stars and Their Lives</strong>, in a breathy whirlwind of alliteration, Carol Vorderman helped fill in the gaps - 'She's gorgeous but she's gutsy too! She's the Geordie with the giant heart! The beauty who battles against the bad times! The model who became a model campaigner' - when she introduced the celebrity amputee and consort to Sir Paul McCartney on ITV's answer to This Is Your Life . </p> <p>I couldn't work out how this inscrutably blank-faced Barbie-blonde (see, it's catching) ticked, even while friends from Chris Eubank to Richard Branson to the Duchess of Kent testified to her all-round gutsy goodness, her toughness and non-conformity. Heather accessorised herself with a dry Geordie wit, thereby unsettling the audience who didn't know quite how to respond to stuff like 'I thought: what's my leg doing over there? I've just bought those trainers! I'll never get the blood off!' </p> <p>But then McCartney came on to kiss her and tell us he loved her, which was like watching the post-coital analysis in an edition of Celebrity Blind Date . Macca had improbably starry eyes, youthfully-tinted hair and described his girlfriend as 'a very beautiful true fine momma'. He looked about as besotted as a man can be without having to display a Do Not Disturb sign. 'I always had this dream of a knight in shining armour,' said Heather. </p> <p>Carol told the couple that there is a lot of goodwill towards them, 'isn't there?!'. 'Mmm!' muttered the audience. But, and I can't put my finger on quite why this should be, given Macca's recent pain and Heather's tireless charity work, Carol was wrong; there isn't quite as much goodwill towards them as they'd like. 'People that are jealous of us, or bitter, you look at those people's lives and they give and do nothing for anyone else. But people who like us are giving, nice people,' explained Mills, which presumably leaves most of us in Nowhere-Man's-land, slightly bemused by the combination of Heather's strident sanctimony and Sir Paul's slavering. </p> <p>Funnily enough, Pride was the first of the sins to be tackled in... well, <strong> The Sins, </strong> BBC1's new go-on!-guess-how-many-parts series, in which Pete Postlethwaite plays Len, an ex-getaway driver determined to go straight. I couldn't take my eyes off that spin-dried Sinatra face, in which sweetness and menace seem to fight for control of his features. So much so, that scenes without Postlethwaite faltered slightly, not through any fault of the script or the acting, but just because Pete fills the screen with so much mutable gravitas. </p> <p>Frank Finlay came close, though, as Len's Uncle Irwin, a funeral director contemplating retirement, regretful that 'there is no obvious replacement chomping at the funereal bit' and operating just a few doors up the road from the Hammer House of Horror: 'I have some lungs to drain, but I can work quite happily while you rummage around.' After his turn as Dylan (love-of-my-life) Moran's evil father-in-law in How Do You Want Me?, Finlay is rather belatedly cornering the market in menacing campery - which is odd given that he was doing it brilliantly as far back as Bouquet of Barbed Wire . </p> <p>Len's sin manifested at a party thrown to celebrate his release from a four-year stretch, where he told his crime cronies they were 'dullards' and proclaimed his freshly minted middle-classness: 'I live in Paradise Drive, I've had a letter published in the Telegraph, one of my daughters is up at Oxford', which, predictably, went down like a pair of concrete wellies, particularly with his family. Suddenly, Len's wife (Geraldine James) couldn't get her regular table at Mario's ('Am I or am I not Len Green's wife?' 'Len Green is not Len Green any more,' shrugged Mario) and 'in the light of recent developments' her credit was revoked at the local boutique. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Len was off to the Job Centre, demanding 'proper, stimulating, middle-aged, middle-England legal employment'. The Sins is deliciously wordy, funny and even had a great car chase - very rare on TV, where even Grand Prix look as though everyone's pootling around the M25 in third gear. Next week sees Len working, inevitably, as an undertaker while struggling with Covetousness, particularly in relation to top-of-the-range, fully-loaded hearses. Can't wait. </p> <p>BBC2's <strong> Marion and Geoff </strong> is a 10-part series of 10-minute dramatic monologues by Keith, minicab driver, divorcee and owner of a selection of Alan Partridge's cast-off sweaters (Steve Coogan is one of the show's producers). Last week saw the halfway mark, which is as good a place as any to ponder Keith's swiftly unravelling grip on what little is left of his sanity. The Marion and Geoff of the title are, respectively, Keith's ex-wife and her new husband, who live in Cardiff with Keith's two young sons, while Keith lives in London but regularly drives through the night accompanied by binoculars, a rifle (with telescopic sight) and toys for the children: 'I thought the Action Man might be too violent but, like his mother says, he's a very violent child.' </p> <p>What initially looked like tragic stoicism in the face of complete rejection (re Geoff: 'I don't feel like I've lost a wife, I've gained a friend!') is proving to be a dangerously thin veneer. Last week, Keith told us how he'd gone to see Father Paul, a pastor - he said: 'You don't need the Church, Keith, you need a bloody good solicitor' - and though we are another five fraught weeks away, the d\u00e9nouement looks likely to inspire a nationwide mini-cab boycott. </p> <p> Luckily, young Sonia Jackson got a lift to hospital in a black cab when she gave birth, unexpectedly, to Martin Fowler's daughter in Thursday's <strong> EastEnders</strong>. This was a disappointing episode not least because too many storylines jostled for our attention. Wasn't a teenage girl going into labour without knowing she was pregnant considered enough to sustain 30 minutes of sudsy excitement? Given that Natalie Cassidy is such a good little actress and Sonia such a sympathetic character, they could both have been allowed to hog the show. Instead, the drama was squandered by having Mo Harris play midwife, and constant cutting to the rows between Melanie and Steve, trysts between Frank and Pat, a showdown between Pauline and Martin and, to top it all, an unnecessarily drunk, and therefore pantomimic, Dot Cotton. </p> <p>These days, EastEnders is often distracted from what, in soap terms at least, used to be a laudable concentration span in which plotlines could develop and thrive.

      "body": "<p><strong> Fallen Angels</strong> Apollo London W1 </p> <p> Just up the street from The Seven Year Itch , No\u00ebl Coward's Fallen Angels could easily be subtitled 'The 12 Year Itch'. That's how long Julia (Felicity Kendal) and Jane (Frances de la Tour) have been married to their husbands, and life is beginning to pall. So when the men have rolled off for a golfing weekend and a postcard heralds the arrival of an ex-lover with whom they both had a premarital affair, they are determined, after a token attack of conscience, to misbehave. </p> <p>While waiting for Maurice - a romantic Frenchman, and the antithesis of their tweedy spouses - to arrive from Paris, the two women dress spectacularly for dinner in Julia's Mayfair flat and proceed to get royally drunk. Thus ensues a hilarious piece of comedy - wonderfully choreographed by director Michael Rudman - as Kendal somersaults over the sofa, slithers horizontally over the furniture on to the floor to light de la Tour's cigarette, and de la Tour tries to remove her shoes while standing firmly rooted to the ground. </p> <p>Yet under the slapstick runs the icy rivalry of what will actually happen when Maurice does turn up. Who will he choose? How will the other one react? Will they really be able to maintain their close friendship as they claim? </p> <p>All this seems fairly commonplace for the year 2000, but it shocked critics to the core when it first opened in 1925 with Tallulah Bankhead as Julia. The notion that the women had had sex before marriage, and were contemplating adultery almost lost the play its performing licence. </p> <p>The work is a fine piece of Coward writing: witty, trenchant, superficially frothy but actually questioning the empty lives led by these indolent, privileged people. It is dominated by strong, feisty women reminiscent of Hay Fever, and there is one of Coward's fantastically eccentric maid characters - Saunders, deftly played by Tilly Tremayne - subtly stealing the limelight from time to time along the lines of the dour Miss Erickson in Present Laughter. Stephen Greif is a smooth Maurice who has lost none of his charm; it is the two husbands - James Woolley and Eric Carte - who have to make the best of feeble parts.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fallen Angels Apollo London W1 Just up the street from The Seven Year Itch , No\u00ebl Coward's Fallen Angels could easily be subtitled 'The 12 Year Itch'. That's how long Julia (Felicity Kendal) and Jane (Frances de la Tour) have been married to their husbands, and life is beginning to pall. So when the men have rolled off for a golfing weekend and a postcard heralds the arrival of an ex-lover with whom they both had a premarital affair, they are determined, after a token attack of conscience, to misbehave. While waiting for Maurice - a romantic Frenchman, and the antithesis of their tweedy spouses - to arrive from Paris, the two women dress spectacularly for dinner in Julia's Mayfair flat and proceed to get royally drunk. Thus ensues a hilarious piece of comedy - wonderfully choreographed by director Michael Rudman - as Kendal somersaults over the sofa, slithers horizontally over the furniture on to the floor to light de la Tour's cigarette, and de la Tour tries to remove her shoes while standing firmly rooted to the ground. Yet under the slapstick runs the icy rivalry of what will actually happen when Maurice does turn up. Who will he choose? How will the other one react? Will they really be able to maintain their close friendship as they claim? All this seems fairly commonplace for the year 2000, but it shocked critics to the core when it first opened in 1925 with Tallulah Bankhead as Julia. The notion that the women had had sex before marriage, and were contemplating adultery almost lost the play its performing licence. The work is a fine piece of Coward writing: witty, trenchant, superficially frothy but actually questioning the empty lives led by these indolent, privileged people. It is dominated by strong, feisty women reminiscent of Hay Fever, and there is one of Coward's fantastically eccentric maid characters - Saunders, deftly played by Tilly Tremayne - subtly stealing the limelight from time to time along the lines of the dour Miss Erickson in Present Laughter. Stephen Greif is a smooth Maurice who has lost none of his charm; it is the two husbands - James Woolley and Eric Carte - who have to make the best of feeble parts.",

The station has been broadcasting every day since 1979 - except for one month in 1990, when the FM tower was destroyed by an Israeli bombardment. On the eighth floor of the still-dilapidated building, Claude Kawas, the 29-year-old station manager, walks me into a studio. </p> <p>In a country repeatedly scarred by war, a country where many young people idolise Hizbollah, the Iranian-backed militant group famous for kidnapping Israeli soldiers, you might expect the music on the airwaves to be a cauldron of radical politics. If any nation on earth were likely to be a fount of political pop music, Lebanon should surely be it. </p> <p>Yet the only radicalism that RML broadcasts is the anti-PC, corrupt westernisms of American hip-hop stars such as Eminem, Dr Dre and the Wu Tang Clan. That and heavy metal. 'The kids especially like German metal music,' says Kawas. He laughs incredulously: 'Yes, I know: German metal! I don't understand it either.' </p> <p>For over 20 years, RML has doggedly stuck to its policy of avoiding political comment on the airwaves. This, despite Muslim-Christian wars, clashes between rival Islamic groups, a border war with Syria and two Israeli invasions. 'We want to bring people down from the level of war,' says Kawas. 'What we do here is pure entertainment. This isn't a country where political expression is tolerated.' </p> <p>The station's current advertisement shows Lebanese politicians graphically manipulated to dance to the tune of Stardust's 1999 hit, 'Music Sounds Better With You'. 'We took a chance with that,' Kawas admits. 'It was dangerous.' </p> <p>The only person in Lebanon who dares to write political pop songs, he tells me, is veteran rock singer Gassan Rahbani, the very mention of whose name tends to make people look startled and slightly scared. For more than 20 years, Rahbani has been, effectively, Lebanon's only protest singer. At 36, his cultural standing is best approximated as Public Enemy mixed with Neil Young. </p> <p>Rahbani Studios is located in Italias, a Beirut suburb nearly 30 miles north of the city centre. During the Lebanese civil war of 1975, Italias withstood heavy artillery fire from the fighting Muslim and Christian factions - and with reconstruction still limited to Beirut, the suburban skyline is dominated by bombed-out high-rise buildings. </p> <p>Rahbani greets me and leads the way to his office. The wood flooring is cluttered with boxes of CDs and vinyl. The walls are lined with pictures of him on stage. He looks an unlikely pop star - nearly middle-aged, balding and with a scraggly beard. A trio of metallic laminates on the wall advertise his favourite rock performers - Jimi Hendrix, Whitesnake and Deep Purple. 'I loved Whitesnake,' he says. 'I could kiss the hands of David Coverdale.' </p> <p>His father, Elias Rahbani, 62, is a multiculturalist composer celebrated throughout the Middle East. Back in the Eighties, the younger Rahbani was catapulted to early success with his hard rock group, Wild Days. And over a 20-year career, he has amassed a back catalogue of 11 albums. His most famous tunes include 'Prohibited' (his denunciation of censorship), 'The Municipality of Beirut' (a scathing attack on local pollution) and 'The Road To The Airport'. </p> <p>One of his most recognised songs, 'Stranger Go Home', has become a veritable national anthem against Syria's 35,000 occupation forces, who have been stationed in southern Lebanon since 1990. Against squealing guitars and thunderous drums, Rahbani delivers his ultimatum to the occupiers: 'You gotta know that/ You'll have to leave/ I'm warnin' you for the last time/ We are a country that could never die/ We'll keep on fighting/ Till you can't find your way home'. </p> <p>Why is heavy metal so popular here, I wonder? 'Heavy metal reminds me of war - the drums are like the cannons,' Rahbani says, matter-of-factly. 'And the raps are like the sound of chaos.' </p> <p>At BO18, a local nightclub on Thursday evening, the city's well-heeled Lebanese teenagers dance to the latest R&amp;B and hip-hop imports.

Many of them are students at the American University of Beirut, where student fees climb up to $4,000 per term. </p> <p>'Hip-hop is very popular,' says Abou Aziz, 23, a local promoter. Aziz puts together touring packages of local groups, booking them into Beirut, Saida and Tripoli. 'Rap music is aggressive,' he continues. 'You have to speak your mind.

      "body": "<p><strong> Akram Khan</strong> Lilian Baylis Theatre, London EC1<br><strong> Swan Lake</strong> ROH, London WC2 </p> <p> Akram Khan dances in freefall, composed and intense, hanging in there for dear life. Where ballet dancers try to escape gravity, he ignores it. Thanks to his training in the Kathak tradition of Indian dance, he can scoot around space like a jump-cut edit. He's moved before you can blink. </p> <p>Khan has launched his own company (now touring) with a trio, Rush, following his concentrated solo, Fix. The solo is addictive, changing subtly each time he has performed it over the past year. Last week's account was the most ascetic yet, more a Sufi meditation than a journey of discovery. </p> <p>The question of whether Khan can transfer his skills to other bodies is part-answered by Rush. He takes motifs from Fix - spins, falls and rolls - and formalises them into rhythmic patterns. At first, you watch only him; then the structure takes over. Gwyn Emberton and Moya Michael contribute their own qualities; where Khan floats, they flail themselves into weightlessness. Rush feels like a work in progress, ready for further elaboration. </p> <p>Anthony Dowell's last season as artistic director of the Royal Ballet opened with his 1987 production of <strong> Swan Lake</strong>. No doubt the first thing his successor, Ross Stretton, will do is replace it with his own. Maybe then we'll be sorry to lose Dowell's version. </p> <p>But since the last Swan Lake we saw on the Opera House stage in summer was the Kirov's, it is obvious how much the Royal Ballet has been missing over the years. Compared with the Kirov's classic account of the white acts, Dowell's looks decadent, sentimental. His swan-maidens are fluffy, lakeside creatures, their abstract patterns blurred by fluttery dresses and a flock of swan-children, cute, minute and in the way. </p> <p>This soft-edged corps bears no relation to the strikingly athletic Odette of Darcey Bussell, a bird-woman whose pinions have to be held down by her determined suitor (Roberto Bolle). She dances with admirable power, then mars her clean sweep by adding flapping hands and a pained expression. Instead of moving in a sustained flow, as Kirov swan queens do, Bussell goes from one pose to another. She end-stops the dance phrases by holding balances as long as she can. </p> <p>It is an approach that works triumphantly in Act III, where her Odile is boldly alluring. Bolle's Siegfried succumbs without a qualm. A discreet partner and excellent dancer, Bolle needs to assert himself more forcefully to complement Bussell's Olympian magnetism. </p> <p>Johan Persson, making his debut on Wednesday with Tamara Rojo, portrayed a feckless Euro-princeling, obstinately falling for the wrong girl. </p> <p>Rojo's Odile was wicked in the modern sense, whipping off triple fouett\u00e9s and shooting seductive glances from under her dark brows. As Odile, she was all of a piece; as Odette in Act II, she seemed to be giving two interpretations - her own and the Royal Ballet's. </p> <p>Everything came together in the last act, where she and the swans, companions in distress, finally inhabited the same world. Act IV is the climax of this production, instead of the coda, a sign of how skewed towards soppiness Dowell's vision has become.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Akram Khan Lilian Baylis Theatre, London EC1 Swan Lake ROH, London WC2 Akram Khan dances in freefall, composed and intense, hanging in there for dear life. Where ballet dancers try to escape gravity, he ignores it. Thanks to his training in the Kathak tradition of Indian dance, he can scoot around space like a jump-cut edit. He's moved before you can blink. Khan has launched his own company (now touring) with a trio, Rush, following his concentrated solo, Fix. The solo is addictive, changing subtly each time he has performed it over the past year. Last week's account was the most ascetic yet, more a Sufi meditation than a journey of discovery. The question of whether Khan can transfer his skills to other bodies is part-answered by Rush. He takes motifs from Fix - spins, falls and rolls - and formalises them into rhythmic patterns. At first, you watch only him; then the structure takes over. Gwyn Emberton and Moya Michael contribute their own qualities; where Khan floats, they flail themselves into weightlessness. Rush feels like a work in progress, ready for further elaboration. Anthony Dowell's last season as artistic director of the Royal Ballet opened with his 1987 production of Swan Lake. No doubt the first thing his successor, Ross Stretton, will do is replace it with his own. Maybe then we'll be sorry to lose Dowell's version. But since the last Swan Lake we saw on the Opera House stage in summer was the Kirov's, it is obvious how much the Royal Ballet has been missing over the years. Compared with the Kirov's classic account of the white acts, Dowell's looks decadent, sentimental. His swan-maidens are fluffy, lakeside creatures, their abstract patterns blurred by fluttery dresses and a flock of swan-children, cute, minute and in the way. This soft-edged corps bears no relation to the strikingly athletic Odette of Darcey Bussell, a bird-woman whose pinions have to be held down by her determined suitor (Roberto Bolle). She dances with admirable power, then mars her clean sweep by adding flapping hands and a pained expression. Instead of moving in a sustained flow, as Kirov swan queens do, Bussell goes from one pose to another. She end-stops the dance phrases by holding balances as long as she can. It is an approach that works triumphantly in Act III, where her Odile is boldly alluring. Bolle's Siegfried succumbs without a qualm. A discreet partner and excellent dancer, Bolle needs to assert himself more forcefully to complement Bussell's Olympian magnetism. Johan Persson, making his debut on Wednesday with Tamara Rojo, portrayed a feckless Euro-princeling, obstinately falling for the wrong girl. Rojo's Odile was wicked in the modern sense, whipping off triple fouett\u00e9s and shooting seductive glances from under her dark brows. As Odile, she was all of a piece; as Odette in Act II, she seemed to be giving two interpretations - her own and the Royal Ballet's. Everything came together in the last act, where she and the swans, companions in distress, finally inhabited the same world. Act IV is the climax of this production, instead of the coda, a sign of how skewed towards soppiness Dowell's vision has become.",

It sounds like a romantic comedy - Ryan and Hanks, even Fred and Ginger - but there is nothing remotely comic here. This love is intricate, consuming and elegiac. And, though the mood is essentially European - say mid-career Truffaut, with a whisper of Brief Encounter - the setting is far away in the Hong Kong of the early Sixties. Wong Kar-Wai, chameleon amongst great directors, has done it again. </p> <p>Tony Leung Chiu-Wai is Mr Chow, a thirtysomething journalist with a pretty wife. Maggie Cheung Man-Yuk is Mrs Chow, a super secretary married to a travelling businessman. The couples find rooms to live in adjoining flats. Slowly, it dawns on Leung and Cheung that their increasingly absent partners are having an affair. Slowly, Leung begins his pursuit of the wronged wife and she begins to descend into an agony of doubt. If she succumbs, will she be any better than her faithless husband? </p> <p>Wong Kar-Wai does everything: action movies, cop movies, epics, often with a French new-wave feel of improvisation. Here, there is none of that. Instead, we move meticulously from one little box to the next, from one poky room to the room next door. Other rooms in the apartment block are filmed down corridors or over shoulders; the only excursions beyond are into deserted streets where rain falls torrentially around the sheltering pair. Complete claustrophobia. We never see the faces of the adulterous husband or his mistress, only their backs: they are ciphers throwing Leung and Cheung into starker relief. </p> <p>Does that sound a trifle dour? It isn't. The family who rent Cheung her room are warm and effusive, always offering food and companionship. Leung's hoary journalist mate is rounded and jolly. There is human life just across the landing or at the office; the characters are rooted in place and time - but that time, too, matters. Falling in love in the Hong Kong of four decades ago isn't a quick, modern fling. You feel the brooding disapproval of a more traditional Chinese society. Contacts must be secret, emotions hidden. Celia Johnson looks out of the railway carriage window. Upper lips stiffen and then quiver. When Cheung is trapped - innocently enough - in Leung's bedroom overnight, because others are playing mah-jong outside, there's no question of a quick roll on the bed. Cheung lies there alone, imprisoned by inhibition. </p> <p>Wong Kar-Wai is never entirely unobtrusive. The director's presence remains constant - sometimes playing jokes, like rehearsals of the farewell speeches Cheung will make to her husband, which appear, for a moment, to be the real thing. But that constant presence merely focuses us more hypnotically on the central relationship; and upon a particular sequence of months and passions locked away, resistance eroding as the mood takes hold. </p> <p>It doesn't work completely. Leung and Cheung are two of China's most f\u00eated stars, one stubby, battered and thoughtfully bemused, the other sinuous and tortured. They hold the screen and the still, silent Leung is especially hypnotic as he calculates and manipulates. But Cheung has an almost impossibly testing role. Can she make us, as twenty-first-century spectators, comprehend and share her inner turmoil? Can she become somebody we not only understand intellectually, but weep for in her desperate dilemma of the soul? </p> <p>Maybe Truffaut could have got that from Nathalie Baye, because her face is infinitely expressive and part of a world we understand. Cheung cannot quite convey that. She agonises, but she can't draw us in. The gap between eras and cultures is too great. The background score, by Mike Galasso, plonks away, sometimes Nat King Cole, sometimes second-hand Michel Legrand, so that you know you ought to understand. But no - you can see the suffering, yet you don't feel it. A love story without the hint of tear. </p> <p>But for all that this is an accomplished and memorable film, one that Wong Kar-Wai fought to finish through two years of censorship and Eastern financial crisis. Why should the censors have worried? There is no sex here, no sweaty coupling. This is love pursued, love won, love lost; love as a mingling of minds and calculation; love as regret.

After 15 years of labour, John Barton, director and co-founder of the Royal Shakespeare Company, produces a massive cycle of plays. It's based on Greek mythology, which means that it touches on almost every issue flying around the twenty-first century: vengeance after war, the chances of a just peace, the impossibility of assigning blame and the point at which a beauty becomes an icon. Stephen Daldry declares he would rip out the seating in the Old Vic in order to stage it. </p> <p>Peter Hall, Barton's life-long friend who becomes, together with his son, Edward, director of the cycle proclaims that if he were running the RSC he'd 'scrap some of the repertory' in order to put it on. But when the premiere of <strong> Tantalus </strong> takes place it is hundreds of miles away, at the Denver Center for Performing Arts in Colorado. </p> <p>Lack of cash meant that the RSC, who commissioned the piece, couldn't put it on. There was no room at the Dome. And no television company was prepared to stump up. This is a shaming indictment of British arts policy: avid for buildings; less concerned with what takes place inside them. But the move across the Atlantic turned out to be peculiarly apt. As if the Fates had been at work. </p> <p>A play which shows the sacking of one civilisation and the making of another - Greece - was performed in a town whose glossy towers and silent gleaming malls are surrounded by the relics of faded glories, by old mining towns with names, such as Silver Plume, as evocative as Troy, though now their only gold hangs from aspen branches. It was acted by a cast of Americans and Britons in a place formed by Hispanic and Native American and pioneer cultures. </p> <p>And Denver's craggy setting proved particularly piquant. Tantalus was punished by continual threat and constantly frustrated desire for betraying the gods. In Hades, grapes were dangled in front of his mouth and a rock was suspended precariously above him: in the Halls' production, you see sand drifting down and at crucial moments hear warning groans, as if an avalanche were about to launch itself on to the stage. Where better to acknowledge this stony menace than in a city shadowed by the Rockies? </p> <p>It's a tribute to Tantalus that it wakes you up to such parallels. </p> <p>And the tribute's the greater because Barton's enterprise has one foot in the academy. He has created his own version of the conduct and consequences of the Trojan War. He has drawn on ancient sources, though without using lines from classical drama. He has written in unrhymed verse, though the verse format isn't always detectable, or delectable. He has larded the dialogue with literary allusions ranging from Troilus and Cressida to The Importance of Being Earnest: 'One rape is a misfortune; two cause comment.' </p> <p> Tantalus has been cut and edited by the directors. But its nine remaining plays - in which the playwright Colin Teevan is credited with providing some 'additional text' - still amount to a marathon: at Denver, they started at 10am and ended at 10.45pm. It is, remarked one member of the audience, 'such a dare to do something this long about something so old'. </p> <p>A battery of surprises keeps the audience on its intellectual toes, not to say tantalised. The structure of the plays is unexpected: a series of cliffhangers, which Barton has described as soap-operatic. The dialogue switchbacks unpredictably from bleak to droll. The plot twists are startling: the Greeks sail off for Troy, but land up in Mysia; Helen is said not to have gone to Troy at all because that was another, more superficial Helen. And, alongside a reprisal of classical tragic themes - do human beings have any control over their own destinies? Are patterns of revenge imprinted through generations? - Barton charts his own concerns. Not least of these is the history of drama, a movement from storytelling to acting, which suggests that Ulysses started out as a bit of a fraud, and that Achilles's son was the first actor - getting himself up in drag in order to beguile the Trojans. </p> <p>Some of this is exhilarating. There are terrific performances from the fluidly transforming (American) Analee Jefferies and from (British) Greg Hicks, as a wry Agamemnon and a tottering carnival Priam. Some of it is casually misogynistic: does Helen, in a world of adulterous men, have to be pure to be adored? </p> <p>Some scenes are made more vital by the Halls' robust, sometimes gorgeous production: the Trojan women, about to be branded by their conquerors, appear in their red wedding dresses like the stumps of teeth; Mick Sands' dulcimers and drums ripple through the action; Dionysis Fotopoulos's design, a hemisphere of sand with a screen of smokey glass at its back, is transformed by Sumio Yoshii's lighting into a rippling underwater region. </p> <p>Other episodes are made more ludicrous: it's bad enough that Barton's female chorus is required to behave like stooges teasing out information from a charismatic male poet. ('Yes he was a god-swan.' 'Which god was it?') But the clumpiness is increased by setting the scene on a Fifties-going-on-Sixties beach, with a gaggle of girls, clenched by bikinis and clutching transistors, desperately trying to look hip. Never can there have been so much explanation with so little clarity. It's a fluent, exciting production which is insufficiently peculiar. </p> <p>It has spawned its own epic struggles. The artistic director of the Gate, Mick Gordon, was engaged to work with the Halls, but exited early. One actor was sacked; one left.

      "body": "<p>Well, one more day of voting to go and it's looking like a two-horse race. Both of the major prizes on offer - the Best No 1 of All Time and the No 1 We Most Love to Hate - are being contested by two front-runners. Not, I should stress, the same two front-runners. Indeed, they are very different. The two songs at the top of the Most Loved poll are classics from the Seventies, while the two songs at the top of the Love to Hate poll were both released in the last five years. Sorry, I can't tell you more than that. You'll just have to wait till January, when the final results will be broadcast on Channel 4.</p> <p>However, I can tell you about some of the broader trends highlighted by the poll results so far. The Seventies, for instance, despite being the decade in which the current Top Three were recorded, seems far from the golden decade if you take into consideration the rest of the results. Of the Top 40 Most Loved No1s, 12 are from the Sixties, 12 from the generally reviled Eighties, and nine from the Nineties (including eight in the Top 30), while a mere five songs have made it from the halcyon era of disco, glam and rap.</p> <p>Oh, and one from the twenty-first century. Yes, rather astonishingly, Spiller's 'Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)', the sole post-millennial entrant, is in the Top 10. The Rolling Stones' only entry, meanwhile - '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction' - barely scrapes into the Top 40, way behind their supposedly lesser contemporaries The Monkees, The Animals and The Kinks.</p> <p>There are lots of quirks like this in the results. As a child of the Eighties, I have to say I'm rather gutted (and genuinely surprised) that Human League's mordant classic 'Don't You Want Me?' is not even ranked in the top half. For me, the early Eighties were a golden period for the pop single: the combination of post-punk aesthetics, the liberating technology of the synthesiser and a certain manic boldness in the fashion world made the years 1980-83 an extremely colourful period in chartland. Yet not only did the panel ruthlessly (and, let's face it, wrongly) dispose of Adam &amp; the Ants and Duran Duran, but of the eight tracks in this list that fit my criteria (ie they made my heart beat faster as an 11-year-old), only 'Tainted Love' has exceeded expectation by scraping courageously into the Top 20. Otherwise, classics by The Jam ('Going Underground'), Frankie Goes to Hollywood ('Relax'), Blondie ('Heart of Glass') and Human League are all muddling around in mid-table mediocrity. As for Spandau Ballet ('True'), The Specials ('Ghost Town') and The Pretenders ('Brass in Pocket'), well, they're so far down, they're practically out. Come on people, Tony Hadley gives you 'the sound of his soul' and you rank him 50 places below Robbie Williams's smarmy 'Millennium'? You ingrates...</p> <p>Elsewhere, there are some startling incongruities. Is the Manic Street Preachers' 'If You Tolerate This, Your Children Will Be Next' really more loved than Gloria Gaynor's 'I Will Survive'? Can 'Gangsta's Paradise' genuinely be better thought of than 'I Heard It Through the Grapevine'? Well, yes - but only by one vote. So all you Marvin Gaye fans should get on the modem now if you want your idol to overtake Coolio.</p> <p>In terms of the kind of songs that are doing best, the received wisdom has always been that ballads sell better than uptempo tracks. That would appear to be backed up by the Top 10 - seven of which are heavy, slushy ballads with a capital B. Seven and a half if you count the opening section of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. Of the songs ranked 11-40, however, only nine are ballads. In other words, only 16 of the Top 40.</p> <p>My idea of a great pop single is, by contrast, something that fizzes with invention, melody, wit and a certain kind of brazenness, yet still manages to sound a little odd . It has to have a chorus that echoes in your head after the second listen (there are exceptions to this rule, obviously - 'Bohemian Rhapsody' being the most daring and popular), but it also has to be non-formulaic and unclich\u00e9d. It needs to have gracefulness and a kind of gleaming perfection, yet also some buried weirdness, an emotional subtext that you didn't expect. And it has to fade or climax before you're ready for it to end, so that your initial impulse is to hit the repeat button or pull the needle back to the outside groove. Every second has to count, from the first sound you hear - the prowling bassline in 'Grapevine', the first high synthesiser note of 'Nothing Compares 2 U' - to the final chord. And it needs passion. In other words, 'Strawberry Fields Forever' rather than 'Hey Jude'; 'Roxanne' rather than 'Every Breath You Take'; 'Wannabe' rather than 'Holler'...</p> <p>As for the great historical war between rock bands and pop acts (recently reactivated by Bono), that's alive and well. Of the Top 40 Most Loved No1s, 16 are by pop acts, 16 by rock acts. There are also three dance, two hip-hop and two soul tracks, plus Gloria Gaynor's disco anthem.</p> <p>The chosen ones are a fairly heterogenous bunch - mostly white, straight and male. Only nine of the Top 40 are by black artists (and that's including Michael Jackson!), with a further two by racially mixed groups (The Prodigy and, er, Band Aid). Eight are sung by women (eight and a half if you count Band Aid), while only four are by openly gay artists.</p> <p>Only two songs out of the 105 have received more votes in the Love to Hate category than in the Love category, which is surprising in such a cynical age, and particularly on a topic like No1 singles, which by their nature tend to be so ubiquitous and overplayed that even the ones you start out loving will begin to grind on you after a while. It's interesting, though, that ballads do even better in the Love to Hate category than in the Most Loved category: sugary sentimentality is clearly something of an ambiguous obsession for the British record-buying public.</p> <p>But it's also noticeable that many singles appear close to the top of both categories. Of the Top 40 Most Loved No1s, 14 are also in the Top 40 singles that we most love to hate. Seven appear in both Top 20s. It is, as The Pretenders once sang, a thin line between love and hate. Now, that was a single...</p> <p><b>From Frankie Laine to Spiller... these are the 105 nominated top No1s</b></p> <p><b> The Fifties </b><br><b>I Believe </b> Frankie Laine</p> <p><b> Jailhouse Rock </b> Elvis Presley</p> <p><b> That'll Be The Day</b> Buddy Holly and the Crickets</p> <p><b> (We're Gonna) Rock Around The Clock</b> Bill Haley and the Comets</p> <p><b> The Sixties </b> <br><b>Albatross </b> Fleetwood Mac</p> <p><b> Baby Love </b> The Supremes</p> <p><b> Good Vibrations </b> Beach Boys</p> <p><b> He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother </b> The Hollies (No 1 on re-release in 1988)</p> <p><b> Hey Jude</b> The Beatles</p> <p><b> House Of The Rising Sun </b> The Animals</p> <p><b> (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction </b> The Rolling Stones</p> <p><b> I Heard It Through The Grapevine </b> Marvin Gaye</p> <p><b> I'm A Believer </b> The Monkees</p> <p><b> Israelites </b> Desmond Dekker and the Aces</p> <p><b> It's Not Unusual </b> Tom Jones</p> <p><b> Je T'Aime...

Elsewhere, there are some startling incongruities. Is the Manic Street Preachers' 'If You Tolerate This, Your Children Will Be Next' really more loved than Gloria Gaynor's 'I Will Survive'? Can 'Gangsta's Paradise' genuinely be better thought of than 'I Heard It Through the Grapevine'? Well, yes - but only by one vote. So all you Marvin Gaye fans should get on the modem now if you want your idol to overtake Coolio. In terms of the kind of songs that are doing best, the received wisdom has always been that ballads sell better than uptempo tracks. That would appear to be backed up by the Top 10 - seven of which are heavy, slushy ballads with a capital B. Seven and a half if you count the opening section of 'Bohemian Rhapsody'. Of the songs ranked 11-40, however, only nine are ballads. In other words, only 16 of the Top 40. My idea of a great pop single is, by contrast, something that fizzes with invention, melody, wit and a certain kind of brazenness, yet still manages to sound a little odd . It has to have a chorus that echoes in your head after the second listen (there are exceptions to this rule, obviously - 'Bohemian Rhapsody' being the most daring and popular), but it also has to be non-formulaic and unclich\u00e9d. It needs to have gracefulness and a kind of gleaming perfection, yet also some buried weirdness, an emotional subtext that you didn't expect. And it has to fade or climax before you're ready for it to end, so that your initial impulse is to hit the repeat button or pull the needle back to the outside groove. Every second has to count, from the first sound you hear - the prowling bassline in 'Grapevine', the first high synthesiser note of 'Nothing Compares 2 U' - to the final chord. And it needs passion. In other words, 'Strawberry Fields Forever' rather than 'Hey Jude'; 'Roxanne' rather than 'Every Breath You Take'; 'Wannabe' rather than 'Holler'... As for the great historical war between rock bands and pop acts (recently reactivated by Bono), that's alive and well. Of the Top 40 Most Loved No1s, 16 are by pop acts, 16 by rock acts. There are also three dance, two hip-hop and two soul tracks, plus Gloria Gaynor's disco anthem. The chosen ones are a fairly heterogenous bunch - mostly white, straight and male. Only nine of the Top 40 are by black artists (and that's including Michael Jackson!), with a further two by racially mixed groups (The Prodigy and, er, Band Aid). Eight are sung by women (eight and a half if you count Band Aid), while only four are by openly gay artists. Only two songs out of the 105 have received more votes in the Love to Hate category than in the Love category, which is surprising in such a cynical age, and particularly on a topic like No1 singles, which by their nature tend to be so ubiquitous and overplayed that even the ones you start out loving will begin to grind on you after a while. It's interesting, though, that ballads do even better in the Love to Hate category than in the Most Loved category: sugary sentimentality is clearly something of an ambiguous obsession for the British record-buying public. But it's also noticeable that many singles appear close to the top of both categories. Of the Top 40 Most Loved No1s, 14 are also in the Top 40 singles that we most love to hate. Seven appear in both Top 20s. It is, as The Pretenders once sang, a thin line between love and hate. Now, that was a single...

This week, I would like to burn every surtitle screen in the land. </p> <p>This rumbling issue (it's more than a decade since they were introduced) took a new twist at the UK premiere of Harrison Birtwistle's <b> The Last Supper</b> . In Berlin earlier this year, the work, sung in English, had German surtitles. Here, it was sung in English with English surtitles. In Germany, it was easy to ignore them. At Glyndebourne, it was impossible not to. Instead of serving this compellingly audacious work, they got in the way. Robin Blaser's libretto, though occasionally plain and effective, had seemed the weak link in this bold treatment of one of the world's most potent myths. </p> <p>Birtwistle wanted his opera to centre on '13 blokes sitting round a table'. Blaser aims for high poetry. In Berlin, enough guiding words could be heard, but the force of the piece was primarily musical. Here, the text interposed itself between score and audience. Words half heard or intuited through Birtwistle's blaze of music looked mawkish in their naked state. </p> <p>In other respects, this co-production between Glyndebourne and the Deutsche Staatsoper had new focus. Martin Duncan's staging, with strong designs by Alison Chitty and lighting by Wolfgang Gobbel, was better prepared than in Berlin. The musical performance, in the hands of Elgar Howarth, a faithful Birtwistle interpreter, was excellent. </p> <p>It is hard to imagine any group playing this glinting, scintillating, pulsating score better than Glyndebourne Touring Opera's fine musicians managed here. The voices of the unseen 'chorus mysticus' singing their ethereal counterpoint had precision and mystery. Ghost, the only female voice (the formidable mezzo-soprano Susan Bickley), offered a radiant contrast to the dark timbres of a violin-free orchestra and the men's voices, led by Thomas Randle as a potently sullen Judas. The three wordless 'visions' which halt the sequence (or dramatic tableaux, as the work is subtitled) are as impressive as anything Birtwistle has written. The composer has elsewhere, notably in Gawain , been lucky in his librettists. Here, it was impressive he could climb so high using such a rickety ladder. </p> <p>The ritual of Birtwistle's The Last Supper , in unexpected ways, is not so far from <b> The Magic Flute</b> though Mozart's last opera has a better line in jokes. Sarastro, High Priest of Isis and Osiris, heads a male order dedicated to the pursuit of wisdom and light. Ceremony and symbol play a central role and the Queen of the Night represents the evils of the world. The work's complexity, often buried by those productions which play up the much- loved pantomimic elements, was exposed with bright intelligence in English Touring Opera's new production, which travels to eight venues until December. </p> <p>Inspired by the star-canopied landscape of Simon Quaglio's Munich 1818 production, ETO sets the opera in an extraterrestrial woodland glade, naive in style, compact and adaptable in function. The Earth spins slowly through the rim of a crater-like hole at the back of the set. (In response to Tamino's 'Where am I?', a member of the highly engaged Richmond audience helpfully replied: 'On the flipping Moon, mate'.) Political correctness makes a predictable appearance: Monostatos the Moor, as disagreeable a racist stereotype as any attributed to Wagner, has become a white thug who all but rapes Pamina. The lovers are fresh-faced teenagers, Tamino in shorts and rugby shirt, Pamina a trim prefect in blouse and pleated skirt. </p> <p>These somewhat unromantic details robbed the piece of a degree of magic. In its place, the production probed the uneasy heart of the work and raised many usually unasked questions. Whereas the end is usually depicted as a straightforward victory for good, here Pamina is visibly - and convincingly - distraught at being initiated into a sect which, in the name of wisdom, is prepared to destroy her mother. She alone apprehends this contradiction while her naive lover follows his new guru with wide-eyed zeal. </p> <p>The immediacy of the staging generally worked well in this small theatre. As Tamino, Eugene Ginty sang boldly and accurately, if a little too starkly, but earned bonus points for being an actual player rather than mimer of the eponymous flute. After a stiff start, Richard Burkhard relaxed and enjoyed the humour in Papageno. He sings lyrically, with excellent diction. Every word of Jeremy Sams's classic translation was audible. Laure Meloy's thoughtful Queen of the Night was virtuosic and not the usual pantomime caricature of evil. </p> <p>The talented cast and chorus were well supported by Martin Fitzpatrick who, in addition to playing the magic bells with great spirit, drew crisp results from ETO's small, dedicated band. </p> <p>The flourishing <b> BBC Symphony Orchestra</b> gave its first concert at the Queen's Hall 70 years ago. This event was celebrated at the Barbican and live on Radio 3 with a characteristically varied programme conducted by the American Leonard Slatkin, the new chief conductor. What other orchestra has the financial freedom to follow such a daring artistic brief, often to less than full houses? One great tradition has been to support British music via premieres of new works (more than 1,000 to date). Two were included here: Simon Bainbridge's skittering Scherzi was inspired by Mendelssohn's Midsummer Night's Dream and possessed of a similar mercurial spirit. The orchestra's new associate composer, Mark-Anthony Turnage, had reworked a jazz-like piece for trombone solo and orchestra, now entitled Another Set To. Turnage's career took a leap forward when he held a similar post in Birmingham with Simon Rattle. </p> <p>Last week, the CBSO announced that Julian Anderson is the next composer in association.

Two were included here: Simon Bainbridge's skittering Scherzi was inspired by Mendelssohn's Midsummer Night's Dream and possessed of a similar mercurial spirit. The orchestra's new associate composer, Mark-Anthony Turnage, had reworked a jazz-like piece for trombone solo and orchestra, now entitled Another Set To. Turnage's career took a leap forward when he held a similar post in Birmingham with Simon Rattle. Last week, the CBSO announced that Julian Anderson is the next composer in association. Even post-Rattle, this city continues to be a seedbed of compositional talent on which others are happy to thrive.",

This show used to be token and meagre, a handful of samples in a little room on which no final judgment was based. Now it makes all the difference. When the judges walk through the four galleries devoted to the prize these days - a solo show for each artist - it may be the first time that some of them have actually laid eyes on the shortlisted art. </p> <p>If that seems outrageous, bear the following in mind: the Turner Prize is open to any British or British-based artist under 50 who's had a show anywhere on the planet in the past 12 months. Faced with the impossibility of seeing even a percentage of this imponderable sum, the five judges are naturally forced back on catalogues, reproductions and tips from their art-world colleagues. It's clear that at least one of them saw Michael Raedecker's embroidered paintings in Eindhoven last autumn, since he happens to be director of the museum in which they were shown. But I strongly doubt that all five flew to Los Angeles to see Glenn Brown's startling new sculptures. </p> <p>So that's just one of the anomalies, along with the closed shop of judges, the annual conflicts of interest and the general, all-welcome pretence, that make the Turner such a slippery award. The best thing to do is ignore it as a low-credibility competition and enjoy it as an exhibition. </p> <p>This is not always possible. Last year was a complete slug of a show, its vitality registering only in tabloid headlines about The Bed. This year's show is tasteful, steady and, in two cases, highly accomplished. There's nothing wilfully bad, flash or obscure here: the services of the Tate's head of interpretation will not be required. Take your grandmother, take your children - the only shock is that there isn't a single video. </p> <p>Tokyo-born Tomoko Takahashi literally wastes her space. Takahashi is best known for sorting several tons of discarded junk into family heaps on the floor of the Saatchi Gallery. Here, she does exactly the same thing, but without the eerie effects she achieved there with fluctuating light bulbs and flickering tellies. </p> <p>Takahashi is not a magpie so much as a beaver. She prefers standard-issue flotsam to discarded glitz and she forms little nests of like-with-like in an archipelago across the gallery. The ceiling is hung with steel shelves and plastic pipes; fake foliage garnishes the filing cabinets below. The look is somewhere between B&amp;Q and a fire-sale at a borough council. Once you've recognised the tidy categories, the inventory seems oddly pointless. So much stuff, so little to look at. </p> <p>Wolfgang Tillmans, the German-born photographer, makes a bigger point with bulk. Tillmans has no style but every style, no subject except everything he sees in the world. He does casual portraits, black-and-white reportage and cibachrome panoramas saturated with sunset colours. He does them framed, unframed, magnified, cropped, minuscule and the size of a billboard. Some are taped to the wall, others suspended from clips. He's showing 57 varieties, mounted from skirting-board to ceiling, plus a whole lot more in glass cases, including spreads for a recent Big Issue . </p> <p>The installation looks like a magazine layout minus the text. Sure enough, these images speak for themselves: a day at the beach, strap-hanging on the Tube, clothes drying, planes flying, two lilies, some bees and a moon rise. You might call it looking at the overlooked, except that this is exactly what we do notice daily. Tillmans just likes to bring it all together in a vista of shared normality. The only photograph of moment for me was a tightrope walker, side-lit in the style of Caravaggio. But that's an unusually beautiful shot. Generally, Tillmans rejects the outstanding for the unexceptional. </p> <p>This is pure sedative compared with the YBA stress on pricks and kicks in recent years. Glenn Brown is the only shortlisted artist with any links back to that phase - he was included in Sensation. But Brown is a loner, an obsessive who paints flawless reproductions of photographs: photographs of famous paintings. You can't see a brushmark in his ultra-flat pictures, a perverse achievement that forces you to admire his cold virtuosity before all else. This technique also deletes the painterly nuances of the original. Frank Auerbach loses his crucial impasto; Fragonard's delicacy becomes frozen and stiff. </p> <p>Over the years, Brown's repertoire has expanded to include Rembrandt, Dali, Baselitz - and rather more of Brown himself. He doesn't just quote, he flanges, reworks and distorts. One of his paintings in the Tate flattens the face from an Auerbach, sets it in an eighteenth-century lunette and colours it in the palette of Landseer's 'Monarch of the Glen'. Retitled 'The Marquess of Breadalbane', after the man who commissioned the Landseer, the picture becomes a multi-layered game, a portrait of a portrait, via other artists and centuries. </p> <p>The creepy thing about these paintings is that you're never quite sure whether Brown likes the originals or is suffering from the anxiety of influence and wants to cancel them out. I much prefer his recent sculptures, which move into another dimension. Some look like meteorites, others like abstracted bouquets or heads. All are created out of globs of pigment, licked into shape with sensuous, liberated brushmarks. Sculptures that look like paintings, they are much less trapped and melancholy than all his paintings from photographs. </p> <p>A little bit of Brown's deadpan paint seems to have gotten into Michael Raedecker's pictures. Here and there, in these evacuated landscapes, a flat patch of white doubles as both water and sky, twisting perspective and baffling the eye. Raedecker won the John Moores Prize last year for 'Mirage', his eery painting of desert which turned out to be stitched and sequinned. He plays paint against thread to create these spacey, spectral illusions. </p> <p>Raedecker's scenes are dreamy in the first place - motel rooms drifting with tumbleweed, cabins snowed up in winter, forest clearings at twilight. But he deepens the disquiet, as in 'Kismet', with this fusion of materials. Mohair trees cast painted shadows; distant mountains, woven in twine, are shrouded beneath rain-grey pigment. </p> <p>Raedecker uses needle and thread to draw shadows and light, veils of paint to disturb the atmosphere. In 'Echo', an oasis is barely visible behind skeins of Spanish moss, yet it also seems to hover as reflection in a pool surrounded by wave-rippled sands. It's a weird phantasm, a figment from Crusoe's dreams translated in silk on linen and the most seductive work here by some way. Raedecker and Brown have been jostling for position at the bookies for several weeks. But that was before they, we or the judges had a chance to see the Turner Prize show.</p>",

Or, as the rules put it, 'the architects of the European building which has made the greatest contribution to British architecture in the past year'. But, in fact, the prize has more to do with boosting the profile of the architectural profession as a whole, rather than creating stars in the way that the Turner Prize does. Architects - outsize egotists though they may well appear to be to the rest of us - suffer endless doubts about themselves. When they are not traumatised about being blamed for everything from the disembowelling of the inner cities in the 1960s to the problems of leaky tower blocks, they need constant reassurance that they are not being ignored by the world at large. </p> <p>As they see it, as a group, they have lacked the clout of writers in a culture as literary as Britain's. And they have seen a new generation of British artists shoot past them in the public recognition stakes. So the Stirling Prize is a chance for them to squeeze into their black velvet tulip-lapelled dinner jackets, drink champagne in the lurid purple glare of the Science Museum's new Welcome wing next Saturday, and watch Waldemar Januszczak hand the winner their \u00a325,000 cheque and bask in a bit of reflected glory. It's a chance to say 'look how much we matter'. </p> <p>The trouble is, until now it has been pretty hard to make the proceedings anything but tedious. The prize is run by the Royal Institute of British Architects, and is based on a shortlist drawn from the institute's own awards scheme. It is limited to buildings designed by members, who, though they don't have to be based in Britain, can only submit projects completed in the European Union. It has turned out on occasions to be a fairly flimsy set of guidelines. Technically, Ahrends Burton and Koralec's British Embassy in Moscow stands on British soil, so it got on the long list, but was eventually rejected on grounds of aesthetics rather than geography. Herzog and de Meuron, though Swiss, would be eligible for our RIBA membership, but they did not enter Tate Modern, the building that did more for the popular appreciation of architecture in Britain than any other in the past year. </p> <p>There have been plenty of rows, but nothing to catch the imagination. Nor have the tabloids found an architectural equivalent of Tracey Emin to sink their fangs into. Instead there have been predictable moans from everybody outside London about being snubbed by London-dominated judges. Part of the trouble is that much of the short list consists of major work from established names with little room for surprise discoveries, more like the summer show at the Royal Academy than the Saatchi collection. </p> <p>But despite all these handicaps, this year the Stirling Prize does seem finally to be on the point of catching fire. A new sponsor has been found to put up the \u00a325,000 prize money. The award is getting television coverage for the first time. But what really thrilled the RIBA was persuading William Hill to open a book on the result. In a perverse, blokeish kind of way architecture is only seen to be on level pegging with the cultural heavyweights, the Turner and the Booker, when it gets into the betting shops. This suggests to the sentimentalists at the RIBA that the prize is well on the way to becoming an institution, clasped to the nation's bosom. There is still time to put your shirt on Norman Foster or Caruso St John, joint favourites. But if you feel like going for an outsider, Sauerbruch Hutton's Berlin HQ for the city's housing association looks cheap for what is by any standards a beautiful building. </p> <p>William Hill has not as yet been exactly deluged with eager punters. 'I'm not expecting this to rival the Grand National just yet,' says Graham Sharp, who set the odds. 'It doesn't matter what you like yourself. The secret is to work out what you think the judges will be looking for. That's why we have joint favourites. With such a London-leaning short list, you might conclude the judges would find it more acceptable to give the prize to Walsall.' </p> <p>Richard Murphy, one well-regarded architect from Edinburgh who is not on the shortlist, claims that it is not where architecture is that matters but how good it is. 'It's not that the list is so London-based that bothers me. The trouble is there is a certain type of building which always seems to do well in awards. They seem to be all about funny shapes.' Murphy is sceptical about Will Alsop's library. 'I looked at the plan and it seems like the guy who delivered the shelves just dumped them on the floor. It's just a big gesture.' </p> <p>Tracey Emin, the one non-architect judge (the celebrity factor), makes a different point. 'So many of the best architects have to get work abroad to survive.' She confesses to having been uncharacteristically reticent in jury deliberations. 'It was fun, but hard. I found myself keeping very quiet at first, all the others seemed to know what they were talking about and I was much more emotional. I couldn't just say that I liked a building just because I liked it. And it's tough to compare. It's easy to make an office block look sexy, but a hotel with about 1,000 fire escapes, now that really is hard to get right.

Grant isn't doing too badly, either. He was spotted at a London nightclub in September with a new brunette. And yet, Liz'n'Hugh were an item for 13 years. That's a lot longer than most marriages last. Plus, those years weren't all rosy. Leaving aside the Divine Brown affair, Liz, in particular, has struggled to forge a reputation for anything other than wearing a lot of lip gloss. Through all of this, Hurley and Grant stayed glued together.</p> <p>The only other public unshakable in the face of adversity is the Simpsons. Can you imagine Marge leaving Homer and then, barely five months on, getting herself a new bloke? Of course not. She'd be too busy getting her hair dyed. Actually, about the only sign that Liz might be behaving like the rest of us are the blonde streaks she has acquired since the break-up.</p> <p>When a 'normal' person, as opposed to one of the Hello! fraternity, comes out of a relationship, he or she invariably vows never to talk to the opposite sex again. Part of this is emotional exhaustion. Fighting to hold a crumbling romantic situation together is draining. We need time to recharge our batteries and lick our wounds. This translates as at least a fortnight on the sofa with a tub of H\u00e4agen Dazs.</p> <p>Then there is the post break-up cynicism. There is nothing that destroys your faith in Cupid's arrow quite like witnessing the death throes of a relationship. The petty jealousies and full-blown rows transform the person you once loved into someone you can't wait to see the back of. This makes you question your judgment. Were they like that when you met them? Have they changed? Have you changed? Are you rubbish at picking a partner? Only the most optimistic would emerge from this emotional frying pan ready to ignite the fire of passion with someone new.</p> <p>Last, and equally important for women at least, is the fear factor. This is the terror of removing one's clothing in front of someone new. Many are the girls who have stayed in an unwise pairing simply to avoid having to start holding her tummy in. He may be bad, goes the justification, but at least I've broken him in to my cellulite. For men, this is matched by a reluctance at having to haul themselves out of a comfortable rut. If a man has to find a new partner, that means making an effort - not eating curry in bed while wearing his favourite knackered T-shirt and watching Match of the Day .</p> <p>However, to judge Liz Hurley or Hugh Grant by these normal codes of behaviour is futile. They are celebrities. Their ability to drop one love and almost immediately pick up another - out with the old, in with the new - is entirely typical of their shiny breed. Liz'n'Hugh don't have children, which is strange, since most starry twosomes are reproducing before the first hangover has worn off. Catherine Zeta Jones and Michael Douglas, Posh and Becks, Scary Spice and Jimmy Gulzar... the rest of us dither for years. Either that, or nature decides to do the dithering for us. Maybe fame makes you more fertile, but celebs don't hang about.</p> <p>To be honest, Liz'n'Hugh did phenomenally well. In showbiz circles, swapping your partner with the same frequency that you might change your designer handbag is de rigueur. The Gallagher brothers have both recently ended high-profile relationships. Are they sitting morosely in a corner playing Leonard Cohen records? Not a bit of it. Noel has hooked himself both an \u00a3850,000 Mayfair mews house and a new piece of arm candy. She is PR girl Sara McDonald. Sara says: 'Noel has had a hard year and it's been difficult for him, but we're getting on well and he seems happier. I think I've helped him.' This makes her sound like a Brownie doing her good deed for the day. However, Noel met Sara at Ibiza club Manumission. This suggests her idea of a good time is not a night in with a family pack of Maltesers. Could this be Meg Mark II?</p> <p>Liam Gallaghre has been almost as quick to embark on a fresh romantic foray. With the ink barely dry on his divorce from Patsy Kensit (she also has a new 'friend') Liam is flaunting Nicole Appleton from All Saints. The pair are said to have discussed marriage even though they've only been dating for four months. Liam, also linked to Courtney Love and Rachel Hunter since his break-up with Patsy, recently rang a newspaper to insist: 'I am in a serious relationship with Nicole and it's going very well.' According to Nicole: 'I'd like this to be the Big One.'</p> <p>Apart from the fact that both Liam and Noel are Back Out There so soon, the really striking thing about both their new relationships is how keen they and their new partners are to stress that these aren't just flings. Most divorc\u00e9es I know want to play the field a bit, sow some wild oats, indulge in all manner of clich\u00e9d behaviour. But Sara McDonald says: 'Our relationship is very deep.' They've only known each other five minutes, for goodness sake.</p> <p>But perhaps it is something about the celebrity lifestyle that encourages turbo-charged romance. For the Gallagher brothers, spells spent away on tour are matched by periods when they are available for canoodling 24 hours a day. When you know you only have a week before you have to say: 'Hello Munich!', it must motivate you to skip the playing-hard-to-get bit.</p> <p>For actors, juggling periods of frenetic activity with periods of crushing boredom is an occupational hazard. Tinseltown's most famous lesbian couple, Anne Heche and Ellen De Generes, broke up in August. They were due to marry later this year in Vermont. The couple issued a statement through a publicist claiming their parting was 'amicable'. It also said: 'We greatly value the three-and-a-half years we have spent together.' Not that much it seems. Less than a month later, Ellen showed off a new girlfriend. Alexandra Hedison is the star of US TV show, LA Firefighters. Does she take her uniform home, one wonders?</p> <p>The supposedly friendly nature of the Heche/De Generes split doesn't fool anyone. Heche was found, following the break-up, wandering about in Fresno 'dazed and confused' and taken to hospital. Still, celeb lore has it that you must pretend that you are terribly mature and calm and even kissy kissy when a romance has run its course. Not all, though. Scary Spice's car crash of a divorce from one-time dancer Jimmy Gulzar is proving highly lucrative for batteries of lawyers.</p> <p>Celebrity is shallow. The suspicion must be that those on whom it is conferred are able to form new relationships so quickly because their old ones never penetrated beneath surface level. However, just because someone is famous doesn't make them any more inured to emotional pain.</p> <p>There is a reason why people become pop stars or world-famous actors. They want to play a part, be loved by the masses. The problem is that with real relationships, rather than the fake one of star and fan, the first flush of attraction mellows into something altogether more mundane. When that happens, the temptation is to look for the next romantic high. The publicity that follows isn't necessarily that unwelcome either. Geri Halliwell, for one, is adept at manipulating her love life to boost record sales, as her 'flings' with Chris Evans and Robbie Williams prove.</p> <p>The celebrity circuit offers endless romantic opportunities. It is one long party. The choice of potential partners is infinite. Add in large amounts of alcohol and illegal drugs and the shyest person in the world suddenly thinks he's Tom Jones. Fame in itself is an aphrodisiac. I was recently at a showbiz awards ceremony. There was a red carpet, paparazzi, and all the girls were wearing dresses that showed lots of cleavage. The air was heavy with the scents of sex and self-congratulation.</p> <p>The high point of the evening was when Carol Vorderman took to the stage. She looked fabulously, sexily vampy. Carol is, of course, newly single. By the blowlamp heat coming off her, if she hasn't found a new man, it can only be a matter of time. What occurred to me is that there is someone who would be perfect for her. He's good looking and wouldn't be frightened by her earnings. It might not last, but...

Perhaps in an attempt to prove his manliness is still intact, he gives me an account, over coffee and shortbread, of how he sawed off his frostbitten fingertips with a fretsaw he'd bought in his local village store. He held his hand steady in a Black and Decker vice. Each finger took about two days, the thumb a little longer. </p> <p>'Mentally, I could probably continue for a long time but physically, a severe loss of strength is normal for anyone after reaching the age of 50,' he says in his curiously circuitous prose.

'She fell in love with the Aberdeen anguses,' he explains, with the fierce protective pride of one eccentric towards another. </p> <p>Now he is contemplating a quieter life, Fiennes seems to be softening in some ways. Having withstood a lifetime of accusations that he is a bloodless 'polar automaton' because of his perceived lack of introspection - Anthony Clare famously described his attempt to analyse Fiennes on In the Psychiatrist's Chair as 'stirring a vortex with a teaspoon' - he now feels a need to redress the balance. In his new book, Beyond the Limits, he examines, sometimes painfully, the lessons he has learned from his mistakes. </p> <p>He also talks about his hatred of being separated from his wife. 'This isn't a subject I have ever discussed, but saying goodbye to Ginnie each time I set off on an expedition has always been the most terrible aspect of my work. It's as bad saying goodbye from an advanced polar base camp as from Heathrow and it doesn't improve with repetition. We try to make the departures as ordinary as possible, almost as if I'm just going to the office and, of course, we have our own ways of saying goodbye but it's the most difficult part emotionally of the whole expedition.' </p> <p>In the past, Fiennes has always ducked questions about his childlessness. But now he admits the biggest regret of his life is not an unmet polar challenge but the fact that he and his wife never had children. They tried, but were unable to conceive. </p> <p>'We spent 17 years of time, effort, worry and anticipation with IVF clinics trying to find something wrong with either of us so we could put it right but they couldn't,' he says, looking into the middle distance. 'When it became obvious it wasn't going to work, we tried to adopt but because we didn't have a predictable income, that was not allowed.' </p> <p>In an attempt to conform, Fiennes took a job with Occidental Oil in 1985, the first and last time in his life he ever drew a salary. 'We applied to adopt again immediately, only to be told that because I was now over 40, it was out of the question,' he adds. </p> <p>Had they managed to adopt, however, Fiennes would not have given up adventuring - 'not unless Ginnie found she couldn't cope, but she's extremely good at coping with everything'. </p> <p>Nor is Fiennes planning to stay at home all the time in the future.

      "body": "<p>Paul Merton loves the way people come up to him and say, 'You look different - oh you've had your hair cut!' as if having his hair cut could explain his great weight loss. As you can see on the new series of Have I Got News For You, he really does look different, no longer puffy and dishevelled but positively svelte, a shimmering vision of elegance almost like - well, not quite like - Angus Deayton. Two years ago he ballooned to a terrifying 17 stone and was frightened by his own passport photograph. So since then he's been eating sensibly and laying off the beer. In the past few months, he's also stopped eating wheat or anything containing gluten because he found it made him lethargic, and the result is that he has lost three stone. </p> <p>Anyway, he looks good - but disconcertingly different to the Paul Merton one knows and loves from television. I was quite worried about meeting him because I always got the impression from Have I Got News (not so much from Room 101) that he could be a bit chippy, sullen, taciturn - I feared it might be a case of me asking ever longer, daffier questions and him giving ever shorter, surlier replies. Whereas in fact he was almost puppyishly friendly, sunny, hello birds, hello trees, and eager to share his enthusiasms, especially his enthusiasm for comedy.</p> <p>He once said, 'I could have been the world's biggest comedy anorak, the most boring man imaginable' and although I wouldn't say boring, there are certain questions such as 'Why do you admire Buster Keaton?' which bring out the inner trainspotter to an alarming degree. As a boy, he used to watch silent comedies on his own projector and analyse every scene, but he's still doing it now - he told me that recently he's bought all the films of Charlie Chaplin on DVD and has been watching them in sequence from the first in 1915 to the last in 1967, tracing the development of his technique.</p> <p>The essential, all-encompassing difference between Paul Merton on telly and Paul Merton in real life is that the real-life version is obviously a happy man. After a rocky couple of years when his marriage to Caroline Quentin broke up, he is now happily settled with his new partner, Sarah Parkinson, and declares: 'We are together for the rest of our lives.' And anyway he is happy because, 'Look, I'm sitting here having lunch in a nice restaurant [the Caprice] on a Monday when I could have been in the civil service office in Tooting - I mean, life is good. And on a day like today when I can see people getting on the tube and I can see their drawn faces and I think, They're going to get into their offices - \"Morning, Lorraine\", \"Morning, Mr Hennessy\" - and that's what they're doing till Friday, I think: Well, just by not having to do that, I'm already ahead of the game.' </p> <p>Last month he and Sarah went on holiday to the Maldives and 'We went to this desert island - they take you there in a boat, and give you a picnic basket and a walkie-talkie - and had a little ceremony between the two of us, with nobody else there. So it was very romantic and we did it at midday on October fifth, so that's 5/10/2000 to make it memorable.' But why not marry properly? 'Oh because Sarah's not keen on the whole church/state thing, and I'm kind of like-minded, really. Why not just two people on a desert island? We got married in nature rather than in church.' </p> <p>Sarah is 38 and the daughter of an actor called Robin Parkinson. She used to be an actress but told Paul particularly to tell me that she no longer wishes to be described as that - she is now a writer-producer. She co-wrote and associate-produced his new film The Suicidal Dog (of which more later), and is also producing a radio series called Catholics in Comedy in which Paul will interview other comedians who were raised as Catholics. (There are surprisingly many of them - Kathy Burke, Julian Clary, Lily Savage, Steve Coogan, Caroline Aherne - quite apart from what he calls 'the Irish contingent'.) Obviously they plan to work together as much as possible. </p> <p>They met in 1995 when Paul Merton and Caroline Quentin were doing a three-month run of The Live Bed Show in London, and Sarah was Caroline's understudy. (She never got to play the role because Caroline was never ill.) At that stage, he says, they were 'just talking'. But then in 1997 his marriage to Quentin broke up. Quentin told me that she was completely shocked and mystified at the time - 'I didn't know my marriage was going wrong till it ended, really.' They had been married seven years since Paul proposed on bended knee by the statue of Eros in Piccadilly Circus and they seemed in many ways a perfect couple. But after Quentin's career took off with Men Behaving Badly, their various work commitments meant they were often apart. When they announced their separation in April 1997, they were hounded by the tabloids for several weeks and The Mirror even sent a pseudo-buyer to their house to photograph their bedroom. Merton is still pretty bitter about all that. He and Quentin have always been careful not to say anything hurtful about each other in interviews, and they are friendly on the rare occasions when they meet. Last year she had a baby by Sam Farmer, a television researcher. </p> <p>Do Paul and Sarah hope to have children? 'Yes, well, we could, we will. We'll have to wait and see really. But I mean - we're doing what we should be doing on a very regular basis, so it's in the lap of the gods! And yes, I could have a child now, because I'm financially secure for the foreseeable future and I don't have expensive tastes anyway. If it had happened when I was 23, 24 it would have been a disaster because I'd have had to give up doing comedy, or attempting to do comedy. But now - yes, maybe.' And Sarah would like children, too? 'Yes - I thought she should get involved at some stage, and the planning stage seemed a good stage to begin!' </p> <p> Paul and Sarah live in considerable style in a listed Georgian house in Parson's Green, Fulham, where he says nobody recognises him 'because they're all too posh to watch television - the only people who recognise me are van drivers passing through'. It is actually less than a mile from where he was born 43 years ago, but Fulham has come up in the world, as has he. His father was a tube train driver, his mother a nurse, and they lived in a council flat. He was very shy as a boy but hooked on comedy from an early age. He thinks the two are connected - he says most comedians are shy. 'I was never one to go up to someone as a five- or six-year-old and say, \"Hello, my name's Paul, will you be my friend?\" But I found if I did an impression of the PE teacher or whatever and people laughed, then they did like me, and so then they started talking to me, rather than me making the initial overture and then maybe being rebuffed. They come to you already happy, you know?' </p> <p>Even as a small child, he really studied comedy. He would watch Sunday at the London Palladium and ignore the singers and dancers but 'If a comic came on - it didn't matter how appalling he was - I would watch, fascinated by the whole process. I got into Laurel and Hardy very early on, Charlie Chaplin, Marx Brothers, the Goons on the radio. Monty Python started when I was about 12, Tony Hancock I loved, and I read PG Wodehouse - I loved comedy in all its forms. I was an avid consumer of comedy. I think there was something in my head whereby I was trying to learn as much as I could about it without actually doing it. I read every book about Buster Keaton and Chaplin to see how they worked - it's all about dedication, tunnel vision, pursuit of perfection, getting the gag right.' </p> <p>But he planned his career slowly, carefully, deliberately, because he didn't want to be famous for five minutes, he wanted to last . His dream is to be like Bob Monkhouse, still working in his seventies. So after school (two A levels), he went to work for the civil service in the Tooting employment office, and wrote scripts in his spare time and sent them off to the BBC. But he eventually realised that they would not buy scripts from unknowns - he had to make his name first as a performer, which meant doing stand up. And he knew he wouldn't have the energy, or perhaps the will, to do that while doing a nine-to-five job. So he left the civil service on 29 February 1980 - he chose the date deliberately so he would remember it - and signed on.</p> <p>'It was a bizarre existence I led in my early twenties - that clich\u00e9 of the comedian who goes out and entertains a roomful of people and then goes home to a lonely bedsit was unbelievably poignant for me because that was exactly what I was doing. I had periods of real loneliness. But it was something I'd chosen to do, it hadn't been imposed on me, so I could never complain. And I didn't have any dependents or anything to worry about other than just living on the dole and doing good gigs, but then coming back and still being on my own.' Did he have girlfriends? 'A couple here and there, but not really. I was never one to do the chasing - I was always very shy - and even if some girl had come up and said hello, I couldn't have said, \"Come back to the bedsit\" - she would have seen it and said goodbye.' </p> <p>He was often depressed - he remembers spending whole days in bed because he couldn't face getting up. 'I always had to battle that thing with confidence - and it took me two years after I left the civil service to get on stage at the Comedy Store. But again, that was partly because I wanted it so much, because to have a great ambition and then find out you're no good at it is potentially quite soul-destroying. So I was postponing or delaying the moment of truth.' But in April 1982 he did his act at the Comedy Store and got a standing ovation and walked all the way home to Streatham in a daze of happiness.</p> <p>Gradually, he built up his bookings and his fees and by 1987 had saved enough to hire a hall and put on his own show at the Edinburgh Festival. It got terrific reviews - but the day after the first night he broke his leg playing football, went to hospital, developed a pulmonary embolism (which almost killed him) and caught hepatitis A, so he was out of work for months. This led to another of his big decisions - he felt he had served his apprenticeship on the comedy circuit, it was time to make the leap into television. He wrote scripts for Julian Clary, appeared on Whose Line Is It Anyway? and in 1989 was commissioned to write his own Paul Merton show for Channel 4.</p> <p>But now again, as when he broke his leg, he wobbled on the brink of success - only this was much more than a wobble. It was a mental illness that put him in the Maudsley psychiatric hospital for six weeks, though even now he yelps when I refer to it as a nervous breakdown and says it was not a nervous breakdown - it was a 'manic episode' caused by a combination of overwork and anti-malaria pills. 'I just think it was a sort of manic excitement, really, because everything was happening and it was going really well. I felt that it was a good thing. Because, apart from just before I went into the Maudsley, I felt good, I felt alive, I felt alert, I was full of energy. It was the people around me who were getting worried - I wasn't too bothered. I thought: I'm achieving everything.'</p> <p>But his friends were worried because he was talking non-stop, almost gibbering, and working 24 hours a day. He suffered what he thought was a heart attack during a run-through of Whose Line Is It Anyway? and they called a doctor, who told him he was hyperventilating and must take some rest. But of course he couldn't rest because he was far too busy. He developed paranoia, thinking that people were talking about him behind his back and that he was being followed everywhere by Freemasons. One day he went to the corner shop and thought everyone was looking at him oddly, and the shopkeeper was reading things about him off his credit card. 'I remember coming out of the shop and running down the side road back to the flat and I had a filmic image of all the curtains twitching.' </p> <p>His girlfriend persuaded him to go to the Maudsley but he discharged himself after a few days because he was desperate to finish writing his Channel 4 series. But then he broke down again and was admitted for six weeks and put on Largactyl. He recalls the embarrassment of going to group therapy sessions with serious schizophrenics and people who had attacked strangers with knives when his only problem, he thought, was that his Channel 4 series had been postponed. He also remembers when one of the fellow patients committed suicide and he volunteered to speak at his funeral but someone shouted something. 'And suddenly I was in stand-up mode. I had to fight the urge to use a putdown, to say, \"Oh I remember when I had my first pint of lager...\" It was a very black comic moment.' </p> <p> But he also remembers the precise moment when he started to get better. It was a Saturday evening, a friend came to visit him and 'What I wanted was for somebody to hug me. But he, being a typical middle-class male, was keeping his distance. And his emotional detachment made me feel even more alone. When he went away, I felt so lonely, I howled, like animals cry.' But that howl of pain was a sort of catharsis, and after that he recovered quickly. Even so, he was reluctant for many years to talk about his stay in the Maudsley. It was only last year, on The South Bank Show, that he fully came clean, and also returned to the Maudsley for the first time, to open a new garden for the patients. He has had no manic episodes since, but has been careful to pace himself and not take on more work than he could handle. </p> <p>Ironically, the Channel 4 series he had literally driven himself mad to write was not a great success. But it hardly mattered because by then Have I Got News For You had started, and made him a star. It is now in its 10th year, and has just shifted to BBC1. One year Merton dropped out and the producers tried various substitutes, whose failure Merton watched with undisguised glee. I said I thought Eddie Izzard was good but Merton corrected me - 'Not bad. His first one was good, second not bad - third one was awful. I'm not being unfair to him, but he was doing the same gags in the third week that he'd done in the second week. But I knew that nobody coming in could immediately pick up and do what I was doing, so I wasn't worried. And I thought me not doing a series would be a good shot in the arm - and it was. I think they missed me a lot, and since then I think we're in the best form we've ever been.' </p> <p>But why is he often so rude to his guests - why does he ignore them so cruelly? He says first, they're not his guests, he has no say in choosing them, he's not even allowed to go into the Have I Got News production office because they say he might see the questions. He only once managed to get his choice of guest on the programme - Spike Milligan - but other times when he's suggested someone he's been overruled. Nor does he have any power of veto - 'I mean, I've sat next to the Hamiltons and I'm no big fan of theirs.' But anyway he says he's not deliberately rude to the guests, or only once, to Teddy Taylor. But he concedes that he might sometimes appear rude. He recently played an old video of Peter Cook on the show and was shocked to see that he never spoke to Cook - 'It looks like I'm being spectacularly rude to him but it's just that, you know, I wanted to kiss him!' </p> <p>He could make a perfectly good living from doing programmes like Have I Got News and Room 101 and Just a Minute (on Radio 4), where he just has to turn up and be funny. Turning up and being funny is no problem for him - he has been doing it since school, he still does it every Sunday at the Comedy Store, where he and Josie Lawrence and friends do a regular improv night, which he says is 'like flying - like jazz, almost'. He is amazed when people say that his Have I Got News jokes must be scripted - 'Nobody's ever given me a joke, I don't need it' - the only preparation he and Hislop get is that they see the headlines and pictures at the run-through half an hour beforehand. </p> <p>But he gets a bit twitchy when people say he is so great on Have I Got News because 'It's just me being a panellist, and I don't think I'm really working at the top of my powers - I just sit there and say something rude about Michael Heseltine and everybody's pleased! It's not quite enough, really. I mean, it's wonderful to be doing a show that's so well paid, and all I have to do is turn up on the Thursday at half five and by 9 o'clock I'm done. And 16 weeks of the year that's all I do and for someone who worked in the civil service, who used to dread going into work on a Monday... So I enjoy Have I Got News and I'm glad people like it, but it's not all I want to do. It's not like making a great film or creating something that has longevity. And that's how I judge comedy, really - will it be funny in 40 years' time?' </p> <p>So now he has made his pitch for longevity - written and directed a short film called The Suicidal Dog which is going out on arthouse release with Chuck and Buck over the next few weeks, and then being shown on BBC2 some time next year. I went to its premiere at the Raindance Festival the other week and it was well received, with plenty of laughs and big applause at the end. The big excitement for film buffs - and for Paul Merton - is that the director of photography is 86-year-old Jack Cardiff, who worked with Powell and Pressburger, with Hitchcock, with Houston (on The African Queen) and photographed Marilyn Monroe in The Prince and the Showgirl.</p> <p>Merton only got him by accident because when Hat Trick, the producers, asked who he wanted as director of photography, he couldn't think of any names apart from Jack Cardiff, whose autobiography he'd read. Luckily Cardiff was a fan of Have I Got News and agreed to do it. But Merton was nervous the first day shooting because 'The crew all knew Jack or knew his reputation and were very very pleased to be working with him, whereas I'm just the bloke off the telly. So for the first few hours they were a bit unsure. And then I contradicted one of Jack's suggestions and there was a sort of hushed moment, everyone waiting to see what would happen, but then he said, \"Yes, that's better, we'll do that.\" He could pull all kinds of rank on you, but he doesn't - he's a great man to work with and I was very lucky to get him.' </p> <p>Also, Merton thinks, he's made a bit of film history, or at least film trivia. Jack Cardiff was a child actor before he was a cameraman and first appeared in a film aged four. He also appears (just the back of his head, on a train) in Merton's film - 'So that's 82 years between first and last film appearances - who else has had that much longevity? Not Lillian Gish, I don't think. Or Bette Davis. I'd have to look it up, but I think he's got to have some sort of record there.' This is exactly the sort of useless information Merton loves - for someone who only got grade five CSE in maths, he is weirdly hooked on numbers and statistics. </p> <p>His big ambition now is to make more films - hopefully a full-length feature eventually. 'It's like a bug that bites you and gets in your bloodstream. There's something magical about film, it's the ultimate for me, because it's kind of permanent - inasmuch as anything is. When I went to see Buster Keaton when I was about 14 and I came out of the cinema having really laughed at this film which had been made 50 years before, I thought: That's immortality. It's fantastic. And if my film is shown after I'm gone and it gets laughs - it doesn't get any better than that, I don't think. Though obviously I'd prefer to live forever!'</p> <p>\u0095 The Suicidal Dog is released on 10 November</p>",

I had periods of real loneliness. But it was something I'd chosen to do, it hadn't been imposed on me, so I could never complain. And I didn't have any dependents or anything to worry about other than just living on the dole and doing good gigs, but then coming back and still being on my own.' Did he have girlfriends? 'A couple here and there, but not really. I was never one to do the chasing - I was always very shy - and even if some girl had come up and said hello, I couldn't have said, \"Come back to the bedsit\" - she would have seen it and said goodbye.' He was often depressed - he remembers spending whole days in bed because he couldn't face getting up. 'I always had to battle that thing with confidence - and it took me two years after I left the civil service to get on stage at the Comedy Store. But again, that was partly because I wanted it so much, because to have a great ambition and then find out you're no good at it is potentially quite soul-destroying. So I was postponing or delaying the moment of truth.' But in April 1982 he did his act at the Comedy Store and got a standing ovation and walked all the way home to Streatham in a daze of happiness. Gradually, he built up his bookings and his fees and by 1987 had saved enough to hire a hall and put on his own show at the Edinburgh Festival. It got terrific reviews - but the day after the first night he broke his leg playing football, went to hospital, developed a pulmonary embolism (which almost killed him) and caught hepatitis A, so he was out of work for months. This led to another of his big decisions - he felt he had served his apprenticeship on the comedy circuit, it was time to make the leap into television. He wrote scripts for Julian Clary, appeared on Whose Line Is It Anyway? and in 1989 was commissioned to write his own Paul Merton show for Channel 4. But now again, as when he broke his leg, he wobbled on the brink of success - only this was much more than a wobble. It was a mental illness that put him in the Maudsley psychiatric hospital for six weeks, though even now he yelps when I refer to it as a nervous breakdown and says it was not a nervous breakdown - it was a 'manic episode' caused by a combination of overwork and anti-malaria pills. 'I just think it was a sort of manic excitement, really, because everything was happening and it was going really well. I felt that it was a good thing. Because, apart from just before I went into the Maudsley, I felt good, I felt alive, I felt alert, I was full of energy. It was the people around me who were getting worried - I wasn't too bothered. I thought: I'm achieving everything.' But his friends were worried because he was talking non-stop, almost gibbering, and working 24 hours a day. He suffered what he thought was a heart attack during a run-through of Whose Line Is It Anyway? and they called a doctor, who told him he was hyperventilating and must take some rest. But of course he couldn't rest because he was far too busy. He developed paranoia, thinking that people were talking about him behind his back and that he was being followed everywhere by Freemasons. One day he went to the corner shop and thought everyone was looking at him oddly, and the shopkeeper was reading things about him off his credit card. 'I remember coming out of the shop and running down the side road back to the flat and I had a filmic image of all the curtains twitching.' His girlfriend persuaded him to go to the Maudsley but he discharged himself after a few days because he was desperate to finish writing his Channel 4 series. But then he broke down again and was admitted for six weeks and put on Largactyl. He recalls the embarrassment of going to group therapy sessions with serious schizophrenics and people who had attacked strangers with knives when his only problem, he thought, was that his Channel 4 series had been postponed. He also remembers when one of the fellow patients committed suicide and he volunteered to speak at his funeral but someone shouted something. 'And suddenly I was in stand-up mode. I had to fight the urge to use a putdown, to say, \"Oh I remember when I had my first pint of lager...\" It was a very black comic moment.' But he also remembers the precise moment when he started to get better. It was a Saturday evening, a friend came to visit him and 'What I wanted was for somebody to hug me. But he, being a typical middle-class male, was keeping his distance. And his emotional detachment made me feel even more alone. When he went away, I felt so lonely, I howled, like animals cry.' But that howl of pain was a sort of catharsis, and after that he recovered quickly. Even so, he was reluctant for many years to talk about his stay in the Maudsley. It was only last year, on The South Bank Show, that he fully came clean, and also returned to the Maudsley for the first time, to open a new garden for the patients. He has had no manic episodes since, but has been careful to pace himself and not take on more work than he could handle. Ironically, the Channel 4 series he had literally driven himself mad to write was not a great success. But it hardly mattered because by then Have I Got News For You had started, and made him a star. It is now in its 10th year, and has just shifted to BBC1. One year Merton dropped out and the producers tried various substitutes, whose failure Merton watched with undisguised glee. I said I thought Eddie Izzard was good but Merton corrected me - 'Not bad. His first one was good, second not bad - third one was awful. I'm not being unfair to him, but he was doing the same gags in the third week that he'd done in the second week. But I knew that nobody coming in could immediately pick up and do what I was doing, so I wasn't worried. And I thought me not doing a series would be a good shot in the arm - and it was. I think they missed me a lot, and since then I think we're in the best form we've ever been.' But why is he often so rude to his guests - why does he ignore them so cruelly? He says first, they're not his guests, he has no say in choosing them, he's not even allowed to go into the Have I Got News production office because they say he might see the questions. He only once managed to get his choice of guest on the programme - Spike Milligan - but other times when he's suggested someone he's been overruled. Nor does he have any power of veto - 'I mean, I've sat next to the Hamiltons and I'm no big fan of theirs.' But anyway he says he's not deliberately rude to the guests, or only once, to Teddy Taylor. But he concedes that he might sometimes appear rude. He recently played an old video of Peter Cook on the show and was shocked to see that he never spoke to Cook - 'It looks like I'm being spectacularly rude to him but it's just that, you know, I wanted to kiss him!' He could make a perfectly good living from doing programmes like Have I Got News and Room 101 and Just a Minute (on Radio 4), where he just has to turn up and be funny. Turning up and being funny is no problem for him - he has been doing it since school, he still does it every Sunday at the Comedy Store, where he and Josie Lawrence and friends do a regular improv night, which he says is 'like flying - like jazz, almost'. He is amazed when people say that his Have I Got News jokes must be scripted - 'Nobody's ever given me a joke, I don't need it' - the only preparation he and Hislop get is that they see the headlines and pictures at the run-through half an hour beforehand. But he gets a bit twitchy when people say he is so great on Have I Got News because 'It's just me being a panellist, and I don't think I'm really working at the top of my powers - I just sit there and say something rude about Michael Heseltine and everybody's pleased! It's not quite enough, really. I mean, it's wonderful to be doing a show that's so well paid, and all I have to do is turn up on the Thursday at half five and by 9 o'clock I'm done. And 16 weeks of the year that's all I do and for someone who worked in the civil service, who used to dread going into work on a Monday... So I enjoy Have I Got News and I'm glad people like it, but it's not all I want to do. It's not like making a great film or creating something that has longevity. And that's how I judge comedy, really - will it be funny in 40 years' time?' So now he has made his pitch for longevity - written and directed a short film called The Suicidal Dog which is going out on arthouse release with Chuck and Buck over the next few weeks, and then being shown on BBC2 some time next year. I went to its premiere at the Raindance Festival the other week and it was well received, with plenty of laughs and big applause at the end. The big excitement for film buffs - and for Paul Merton - is that the director of photography is 86-year-old Jack Cardiff, who worked with Powell and Pressburger, with Hitchcock, with Houston (on The African Queen) and photographed Marilyn Monroe in The Prince and the Showgirl. Merton only got him by accident because when Hat Trick, the producers, asked who he wanted as director of photography, he couldn't think of any names apart from Jack Cardiff, whose autobiography he'd read. Luckily Cardiff was a fan of Have I Got News and agreed to do it. But Merton was nervous the first day shooting because 'The crew all knew Jack or knew his reputation and were very very pleased to be working with him, whereas I'm just the bloke off the telly. So for the first few hours they were a bit unsure. And then I contradicted one of Jack's suggestions and there was a sort of hushed moment, everyone waiting to see what would happen, but then he said, \"Yes, that's better, we'll do that.\" He could pull all kinds of rank on you, but he doesn't - he's a great man to work with and I was very lucky to get him.' Also, Merton thinks, he's made a bit of film history, or at least film trivia. Jack Cardiff was a child actor before he was a cameraman and first appeared in a film aged four. He also appears (just the back of his head, on a train) in Merton's film - 'So that's 82 years between first and last film appearances - who else has had that much longevity? Not Lillian Gish, I don't think. Or Bette Davis. I'd have to look it up, but I think he's got to have some sort of record there.' This is exactly the sort of useless information Merton loves - for someone who only got grade five CSE in maths, he is weirdly hooked on numbers and statistics. His big ambition now is to make more films - hopefully a full-length feature eventually. 'It's like a bug that bites you and gets in your bloodstream. There's something magical about film, it's the ultimate for me, because it's kind of permanent - inasmuch as anything is. When I went to see Buster Keaton when I was about 14 and I came out of the cinema having really laughed at this film which had been made 50 years before, I thought: That's immortality. It's fantastic. And if my film is shown after I'm gone and it gets laughs - it doesn't get any better than that, I don't think. Though obviously I'd prefer to live forever!' \u0095 The Suicidal Dog is released on 10 November",

Of the many thousands of companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, only a tiny percentage are genuine growth stars. We list them all in the table below, which details the annual survey by our sister publication, Money Observer , of companies that have maintained or raised equity earnings per share every year for the past decade. </p> <p>Jayesh Manek, manager of Manek Growth Fund, says: 'Earnings are one of the key criteria: the momentum, or how they are increasing over previous years.' </p> <p>Original figures from data provider Datastream have been adjusted for exceptional items such as disposals. So a company that has increased earnings by sell ing off underperforming divisions, for instance, would not make the grade. </p> <p>Any portfolio containing all 13 companies would be a stellar performer, but they are not easily definable and it would be difficult even for professionals to spot them all. The groups differ, but one thing they have in common is sound management. Unfortunately, this can be impossible to spot without the benefit of hindsight. </p> <p>Equity earnings are the product of a quoted company's efforts over the year, and can indicate how well a group is employing its resources or, more accurately, its equity capital (represented most often by ordinary shares). This capital base is not set in stone from the minute the company floats: it should develop and expand. If used wisely, this extra capital will generate increased equity earnings and a higher share price. </p> <p>To expand, a company will need to borrow at some point, either from the bank or by issuing fixed-interest securities such as unsecured loan stock, debenture stock or preference shares. However, far more can be raised through the issue of new equity or, put simply, extra shares. The amounts raised here, either through a rights issue or a secondary placing, can be as much as the stock market will tolerate. </p> <p>The effect is a virtuous circle, from growth to expansion to profit to growth. Clever managers will be able to generate enough profit to compensate for the new shares, otherwise earnings will suffer. </p> <p>All the companies in our table have locked into this virtuous circle, exhibiting a rising share price along with increased earnings figures. Close Brothers, for instance, was priced at 500p two years ago, but it is now changing hands for 1,180p. During this time, its earnings have increased by 88 per cent. Similarly, Serco Group was 65p five years ago; it is now worth 647.5p per share. Its earnings rose 125.5 per cent in that time. </p> <p>Those losing faith in growth stories will be heartened by the fact that the number of companies in our table has increased from 12 last year to 13. There were only eight in 1998. Last year we named seven companies we thought might make our table this year. </p> <p>Three of them - Capita Group, Close Brothers and Rathbone Brothers - did just that. SmithKline Beecham would have been included if it was not merging with its rival in the pharmaceuticals sector, Glaxo Wellcome. Of the others, Compass Group has become Granada Compass, Hays has failed to increase earnings this year and fund manager Perpetual has yet to report its latest annual results. </p> <p>Investment manager Close Brothers delighted shareholders with its recent results, but even more success could be in store. William Patterson, manager of the Lionheart Winners' Investment Trust, explains: 'Close's record speaks for itself. It has good price momentum, positive newsflow and its recent results were excellent. If the rumours are true about Close selling its volatile Winterflood division, it could be revalued and look cheap.' </p> <p>That would be good news for the share price, which is already a 'buy' with many stockbrokers. </p> <p>Capita Group provides support services for government and the private sector. Business is booming and last year turnover was up 38 per cent, producing increased earnings of 4.06p, up 37 per cent. This success looks set to continue, and last month we added Capita to our Global Nifty Fifty portfolio. Fund managers agree. Manek says: 'Outsourcing is increasing and Capita is one of the best-placed to benefit from that'. </p> <p>But he warns: 'I bought it for the fund last year and sold it in February. Now, I think the multiples are high and it will find it difficult to maintain its previous growth rate.' </p> <p>Investment manager Rathbone has also imp-ressed. Over the last three years turnover shot up 42 per cent and pre-tax profits leapt 108 per cent. The share price has appreciated 17 per cent since the start of the year and 235 per cent over the last five years. Rathbone's interim results point towards 2000 as another year of good progress. The professionals remain positive.Patterson says: 'We think it is a very good prospect.' </p> <p>Other surprise new entrants this year are catalogue retailer N Brown Group and water company Kelda, while Johnston Press, a stalwart of this survey, should continue to do well. The newspaper publisher is expected to increase earnings by around 20 per cent in the current year. </p> <p>Manek says: 'Johnston Press has always been on my wish list but has always been too expensive.' The shares are steadily coming down in price, though, and stand at 315p, off the high of 375p earlier this year. Special mention should also go to Domestic &amp; General Group, Rentokil Initial and William Morrison, as all three were also members of our income stars survey last November. They had all managed to increase their dividend payouts by at least 10 per cent for 10 consecutive years. Coupled with their earnings records, this is a fantastic achievement. </p> <p>Four companies have vanished from last year's table, but only two because of poor performance. Brewers Greenall Group and Morland were both taken over - Morland by Greene King, the third drop-out from last year, proving that using earnings for expansion can hit the balance sheet hard. </p> <p>The fourth to fall from grace was Vodafone, which had a busy year merging with US firm AirTouch and absorbing Germany's Mannesmann. Again, it was expansion and acquisition that harmed the group's formerly fine record. </p> <p>Brokers expect 11 of the 13 groups in our table to increase earnings for the current year. As investment opportunities some of them look better than others. </p> <p>Indeed, some could even be called cheap on current price/earnings valuations, the ratio used by investors to determine how much they are paying for future growth. Used against the sector or market average, it can determine whether a company is cheap or expensive in relation to its peers. </p> <p>Brown's, for instance, is on a p/e of 28.0, which is higher than its sector average of 15.1 and the UK market in general, which is on 21.4. This suggests that any future growth may already have been accounted for in Brown's share price. </p> <p>But Kleeneze, which is in the same sector as Brown's, has a p/e ratio of just 9.3, way below the general retail sector and the whole UK market. So Kleeneze could prove the more astute buy. Others that look cheap include Rentokil Initial, Town Centre Securities and Serco Group. Patterson says Serco 'looks good for upwards earnings revisions'. </p> <p>Rotork, Morrison and Domestic &amp; General look expensive in relation to their peers, but only because the market is expecting greater things from them. If that means another 10 years of earnings growth, shareholders will be more than happy. </p> <p>\u0095 For full details of this year's growth stars, as well as companies which might be next year's, see the November issue of Money Observer, \u00a33.50 from newsagents.

      "bodyText": "I have injured my shoulder so badly through work that I can no longer do the physical job I have performed for many years. But it seems that, instead of helping to find a physically easier role, my employers are getting ready to dismiss me. What can I do? The basic situation used to be that you could be fairly dismissed if you could no longer do your job. Unfair as it may sound, no distinction would be made as to whether you had sustained the injury on a skiing holiday or in the course of your duties. You could be dismissed either way. A way forward was, in some cases, to make a personal injury claim against your employer. But in the past few years new protections have come in. Under the Disability Discrimination Act, employers are meant to try to redeploy you or make other arrangements to keep you if you have a long-term illness. So, your employer should be exploring the possibility of other, less physical, types of work with you. Some employers are not yet familiar with these rules - and they give too much latitude to their medical advisers, who may not understand the implications of new laws. Legal advice from Hammond Suddards Edge",

So why were there only 50,000 Sipps among the 6 million private pensions taken out last year, and will this change as online Sipps arrive? </p> <p>Sipps were introduced in 1989 to enable pension holders to manage their own investments. They can be used to build up a pension for retirement or, more traditionally, to house a fund set up after retirement. </p> <p>Sipps, like other personal pensions, are available to employees who are not in company schemes, to the self-employed and to partnerships. </p> <p>Thomas McPhail, pensions development manager for Wolverhampton-based financial adviser Torquil Clark says: 'Sipps would suit someone in their forties or fifties who wants to do something imaginative with their fund, and growth is tax free because it is in a pension fund. But you should have investment knowledge, or pay an adviser.' </p> <p>The choice of investments under Sipps is wide. Money can go directly into shares or collective investments such as unit trusts as well as into life insurance and commercial property. </p> <p>This means you don't have to place all your hard-earned cash with one provider, as you do with other personal pensions. You can diversify your investments to minimise risk, and take your pick of the best performers'z. </p> <p>Nick Bamford, managing director of Cranleigh-based financial adviser Informed Choice, which does a lot of Sipps business, says: 'Sipps give you control over your investment, something many people find appealing given current disillusionment with providers.' </p> <p>But they are perceived as expensive. There are set up charges, annual charges, fund management charges and trading charges - all of which can run into thousands of pounds, making small Sipps impractical. </p> <p>McPhail says: 'They are definitely for high net worth clients. You are looking at making monthly payments of \u00a3400 to \u00a3500 a month on top of a lump sum transfer value or one off payment of \u00a320,000.' </p> <p>He says if the Sipp is for an income drawdown plan - which allows you to keep your fund invested in the stock market after retirement while you draw an annual income from it - you need\u00a3100,000. </p> <p>But if you are seeking a spread of investments, you could consider a personal pension such as Skandia's which invests in a wide range of funds without the hassle of all the trading involved with Sipps. </p> <p>Bamford disagrees.'If you are using a Sipp for income drawdown, you will have to build up a substantial fund, he says. 'But the situation is different if you are building up a fund. It works out cheaper than taking out a pension through an insurance company.' </p> <p>Sipp charges do vary. Establishing a Sipp can cost anywhere between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000, while management fees can be as much as \u00a3500 a year. The trading fee is typically 1 per cent of the deal. </p> <p>Life insurer National Mutual's Sipp has a setting-up charge of \u00a3625 and an annual management fee of \u00a3400. If you trade yourself, it will cost you \u00a325 a shot. James Hay's Sipp has a setting-up fee of \u00a3290 and an annual management charge of \u00a3455.

      "body": "<p>Should pensioners invest for their old age? The question is not as ludicrous as it sounds. Increasing life ex-pectancy means many people aged 65 or more could well live for another 20 to 30 years. </p> <p>In investment terms, 20 years is certainly a decent period to acquire some capital growth. However, getting the balance between investment income - what many old people really need in old age - and long-term capital investment growth is quite a trick, especially in today's low interest-rate environment. </p> <p>What, then, are the op-tions for the silver-haired in-vestor? Mark Bolland of In-dependent financial adviser firm Chamberlain de Broe advises looking hard at your income needs first. </p> <p>'A lot of older people want to know how much income they can get from a lump sum. I always turn the question on its head and say how much do you need? Wanting an income of \u00a32,000 a month is all very well but will fast eat up your capital. Asking for \u00a3250 a month gives you far more flexibility in terms of future growth, and won't erode your capital investment so quickly.' </p> <p>Capital ero-sion, especially for 'young' pensioners, can be disastrous, particularly if inflation re-emerges to eat away your purchasing power. So resisting the temptation to tuck into too much pension in-come too early is vital. </p> <p>For those wanting income with the opportunity for a little capital growth, Kim North of London IFA firm Calkin Pattinson suggests looking at corporate bonds. Issued by companies as a form of debt, they are traded in the stock market but pay set rates of return. </p> <p>North says: 'I'm a big fan of these as they are a good halfway house between cash and equities. Both Perpetual's Monthly Income Plus and ABN Amro High Income are worth a look.' </p> <p>But be careful. Although some corporate bond funds provide attractive levels of income, they can expose your capital to some risk, particularly if interest rates go up. This usually reduces demand, which affects prices. </p> <p>Income can also fluctuate. The country's largest corpo rate bond fund, CGU Monthly Income Plus, is cutting its annual income from 7.8 to 6.3 per cent from November. The fund could no longer maintain the higher return without eating into capital. </p> <p>Equity income funds, on the other hand, take a less ambitious attitude to in-come, generally providing yields of around 3 per cent. This means, crucially, that your capital is unlikely to be used up so quickly. Equity income funds are better suited to those who only need a small income top-up. </p> <p>Ben Yearsley, investment manager for Hargreaves Lansdown, suggests looking at Newton Higher Income. 'This fund concentrates on buying out-of-favour stocks on high, sustainable yields and selling them once prices go up - it's a good, classic income fund. Newton staff hold a significant minority stake in the company, so they're highly incentivised to provide results.' </p> <p>Tax-paying pensioners need to look for ways to earn income and growth tax-free. Using up annual allowances for Individual Savings Accounts -\u00a37,000 for an individual in one tax year - is one method. </p> <p>Another route to maximising in-come is through your \u00a37,200 capital gains tax allowance, possibly via zero dividend preference shares - a very complicated name for a simple, low-risk product. </p> <p>Zeros, as they are called, are a class of share in an investment trust that pays no income but a pre-set level of capital return. They are particularly good for low- to medium-risk investors with modest funds. You can cash in the zeros on maturity and use the profit as tax-free income. </p> <p>Rosemary Heaversedge of Shropshire Independent Financial and Mortgage Services says: 'Retired people who want income should look at these, which are relatively low risk.' </p> <p>Older investors should work out how much income they can manage on, how much they might need for potential long-term healthcare costs or help in the house and set aside a rainy day fund of cash. Only then are they in a position to think aboutlong-term capital growth. </p> <p>Share prices have been turbulent recently, particularly those of telecoms, media and telecommunications companies. But shares have historically proved far better investment vehicles than cash or gilts, even in the long stock market downturn in the Sixties and Seventies. </p> <p>Although investing in shares can be risky, you don't have to play too safe and you don't have to confine yourself to buying individual stocks. Taking a small holding in, say, technology or a Far East fund doesn't have to jeopardise your capital too greatly, and can add a little zing to your portfolio. </p> <p>But if you like the idea of investing in straight companies, stick to FTSE 100 blue chips, says Stephen Bland of the Motley Fool personal finance website. </p> <p>'No more than 10 to 15 holdings are needed, even for very large amounts of money. Avoid too much concentration in a particular sector. A couple of banks would be fine, but you don't want eight, even if they are attractive long-term yielders at present.' </p> <p>Bland says another advantage of direct equity investing is that the money can be taken out without penalty at any time - 'not the case with many other investments to which older people are sometimes drawn'. </p> <p>However, as with all stocks and shares, equities need to be watched closely. Com-panies, like any other business, go through their good and bad patches. </p> <p>Points to consider: </p> <p>\u0095 For a non-tax-paying wife whose husband may have a good pension, one tax-efficient manoeuvre is to take out an offshore investment in her own name. Also, consider putting the major part of bank or building society deposits in the wife's name so she can have the interest paid tax-free (ask for form IR85), making use of her personal tax allowance. </p> <p>\u0095 Be careful when looking at with-profits bonds. Although they have performed well in the last 10 years, past returns of 10 per cent annual growth are unlikely to be repeated; 6-7 per cent is more likely to be the new norm. Also, with-profits bonds are commonly perceived as low-risk. They are not. </p> <p>\u0095 Don't turn your nose up at annuities. Despite declining yields they could sink even lower in years to come. For anyone who lives to a ripe old age, a guaranteed income is worth having. The longer you live, the better the deal. </p> <p>\u0095 Remember there is no point in living frugally to maintain capital investment value if your dependents have little need for an inheritance </p> <p>\u0095 After the age of 80, circum stances often change; you are less likely to be seeking capital growth than income. Make sure your financial arrangements are flexible. </p> <p>\u0095 Don't believe everything you read. 'What you must not rely on is company literature saying we have had 19 per cent growth,' says Rosemary Heaversedge. 'You can't rely on past performance tables - I never send clients these as I think they're often misleading.'</p>",

Asking for \u00a3250 a month gives you far more flexibility in terms of future growth, and won't erode your capital investment so quickly.' Capital ero-sion, especially for 'young' pensioners, can be disastrous, particularly if inflation re-emerges to eat away your purchasing power. So resisting the temptation to tuck into too much pension in-come too early is vital. For those wanting income with the opportunity for a little capital growth, Kim North of London IFA firm Calkin Pattinson suggests looking at corporate bonds. Issued by companies as a form of debt, they are traded in the stock market but pay set rates of return. North says: 'I'm a big fan of these as they are a good halfway house between cash and equities. Both Perpetual's Monthly Income Plus and ABN Amro High Income are worth a look.' But be careful. Although some corporate bond funds provide attractive levels of income, they can expose your capital to some risk, particularly if interest rates go up. This usually reduces demand, which affects prices. Income can also fluctuate. The country's largest corpo rate bond fund, CGU Monthly Income Plus, is cutting its annual income from 7.8 to 6.3 per cent from November. The fund could no longer maintain the higher return without eating into capital. Equity income funds, on the other hand, take a less ambitious attitude to in-come, generally providing yields of around 3 per cent. This means, crucially, that your capital is unlikely to be used up so quickly. Equity income funds are better suited to those who only need a small income top-up. Ben Yearsley, investment manager for Hargreaves Lansdown, suggests looking at Newton Higher Income. 'This fund concentrates on buying out-of-favour stocks on high, sustainable yields and selling them once prices go up - it's a good, classic income fund. Newton staff hold a significant minority stake in the company, so they're highly incentivised to provide results.' Tax-paying pensioners need to look for ways to earn income and growth tax-free. Using up annual allowances for Individual Savings Accounts -\u00a37,000 for an individual in one tax year - is one method. Another route to maximising in-come is through your \u00a37,200 capital gains tax allowance, possibly via zero dividend preference shares - a very complicated name for a simple, low-risk product. Zeros, as they are called, are a class of share in an investment trust that pays no income but a pre-set level of capital return. They are particularly good for low- to medium-risk investors with modest funds. You can cash in the zeros on maturity and use the profit as tax-free income. Rosemary Heaversedge of Shropshire Independent Financial and Mortgage Services says: 'Retired people who want income should look at these, which are relatively low risk.' Older investors should work out how much income they can manage on, how much they might need for potential long-term healthcare costs or help in the house and set aside a rainy day fund of cash. Only then are they in a position to think aboutlong-term capital growth. Share prices have been turbulent recently, particularly those of telecoms, media and telecommunications companies. But shares have historically proved far better investment vehicles than cash or gilts, even in the long stock market downturn in the Sixties and Seventies. Although investing in shares can be risky, you don't have to play too safe and you don't have to confine yourself to buying individual stocks. Taking a small holding in, say, technology or a Far East fund doesn't have to jeopardise your capital too greatly, and can add a little zing to your portfolio. But if you like the idea of investing in straight companies, stick to FTSE 100 blue chips, says Stephen Bland of the Motley Fool personal finance website. 'No more than 10 to 15 holdings are needed, even for very large amounts of money. Avoid too much concentration in a particular sector. A couple of banks would be fine, but you don't want eight, even if they are attractive long-term yielders at present.' Bland says another advantage of direct equity investing is that the money can be taken out without penalty at any time - 'not the case with many other investments to which older people are sometimes drawn'. However, as with all stocks and shares, equities need to be watched closely. Com-panies, like any other business, go through their good and bad patches. Points to consider: \u0095 For a non-tax-paying wife whose husband may have a good pension, one tax-efficient manoeuvre is to take out an offshore investment in her own name. Also, consider putting the major part of bank or building society deposits in the wife's name so she can have the interest paid tax-free (ask for form IR85), making use of her personal tax allowance. \u0095 Be careful when looking at with-profits bonds. Although they have performed well in the last 10 years, past returns of 10 per cent annual growth are unlikely to be repeated; 6-7 per cent is more likely to be the new norm. Also, with-profits bonds are commonly perceived as low-risk. They are not. \u0095 Don't turn your nose up at annuities. Despite declining yields they could sink even lower in years to come. For anyone who lives to a ripe old age, a guaranteed income is worth having. The longer you live, the better the deal. \u0095 Remember there is no point in living frugally to maintain capital investment value if your dependents have little need for an inheritance \u0095 After the age of 80, circum stances often change; you are less likely to be seeking capital growth than income. Make sure your financial arrangements are flexible. \u0095 Don't believe everything you read. 'What you must not rely on is company literature saying we have had 19 per cent growth,' says Rosemary Heaversedge. 'You can't rely on past performance tables - I never send clients these as I think they're often misleading.'",

      "bodyText": "The oil giants are set to announce record third-quarter profits as the spiralling price of crude and huge refining margins combine to produce results 100 per cent up on last year. Analysts are predicting that the third-quarter profits to be announced over the coming weeks from UK and European oil majors will represent a 10-year high. Shell kicks off the reporting season on Thursday, with analysts predicting increases of between 70 and 90 per cent on last year's numbers. BP's figures are expected to be even higher. The timing of the results could not be more sensitive for UK oil companies. BP's come on 7 November, the day before Chancellor Gordon Brown is due to announce his pre-Budget report, and six days before the deadline for a fresh round of refinery blockades by demonstrators protesting at fuel duty levels. The Government was angered by the role of the oil industry during the fuel crisis and has sought to deflect blame for the unrest on to the high price of oil, which, it argues, is the cause of the majority of the increase in prices at the pump, rather than high fuel duty. There has been speculation that Brown may alter the North Sea tax regime. But Ministers are concerned that this may undermine investment in the North Sea; they recently said publicly that Brown is unlikely to do this in his pre-Budget statement. However industry analysts and motoring groups argue that Brown could link Petroleum Revenue Tax to the crude oil price without frightening off investment. Commerzbank oil analysts Steven Turner and Clay Smith stated in a research note last week: 'It is difficult to imagine a more favourable environment than that which existed in the third quarter, 2000.

Another reason for Brown's reticence is the threat by oil companies to scale down North Sea investment plans - slated for a 33 per cent increase to \u00a34bn next year. Oil companies argue that their returns are minimal during cyclical troughs in the crude price - determined in part by the Opec cartel - and that they are facing problems downstream at the petrol pump, where high prices work against their margins.",

      "body": "<p>Two years ago, director Curtis Hanson delighted audiences and critics with his devout adaptation of James Ellroy's LA Confidential, a classic example of book noir. It was a rare example of a very good novel being turned into a very fine movie, a transubstantiation that did not come to pass with The Talented Mr Ripley, The End Of The Affair, Les Miserables, The Great Gatsby or any number of War And Peace adaptations.</p> <p>One thing that gave LA Confidential a certain cachet was its mesmerising sense of place, its faithful portrayal of Los Angeles, circa 1950, as a balmy Inferno where the Borgias and the Medicis would not have felt out of place: Purgatory del Rey, if you will. It was as if LA was a character in the movie, the way London is a character in those old Sherlock Holmes films.</p> <p>Now Hanson is back with another book adaptation set in a troubled municipality. In Wonder Boys, the backdrop is studiously unglamorous Pittsburgh, a city that was once the capital of the US steel industry, which has somehow managed to avoid becoming an out-and-out hellhole like Gary, Indiana, or Camden, New Jersey, but has not actually succeeded in becoming anything other than Pittsburgh, former capital of the US steel industry. In this dowdy town abides a middle-aged, dope-smoking, skirt-chasing creative writing professor played with commendable industry by Michael Douglas.</p> <p>Michael Douglas has a history of making good movies in which he is the least talented of the major players - The China Syndrome, Wall Street, The War Of The Roses, The Star Chamber, The Game - and Wonder Boys is no exception. Tobey Maguire, Frances McDormand, Rip Torn and Robert Downey Jr are all far better actors than Michael Douglas and discreetly outperform him here. But without Michael Douglas, movies like Wonder Boys don't get made. Or, if they do get made, they star somebody perfectly awful, like Kurt Russell. So we should all be thankful for small mercies.</p> <p>The term \"Wonder Boys\" refers to fabulously talented young male writers who may fail to live up to their youthful potential because life, drugs, alcohol, women or a combination of all four get in the way. Douglas was once a Wonder Boy: Seven years earlier he wrote a magnificent first novel entitled The Arsonist's Daughter and seemed destined for greatness.</p> <p>But now he is bogged down in a 2,612-page epic that does not appear to be about anything in particular, and it is not anywhere close to completion. He is no longer a Wonder Boy. He is now looking more like a precocious has-been.</p> <p>Worse still, his wife has just left him; his mistress (McDormand) - who happens to be his boss's wife - is pregnant; and his struggling New York editor (Downey) is coming to town to read the novel he has not finished writing, hoping to get his own career back on track.</p> <p>Into Douglas's life steps Tobey Maguire, a Wonder Boy whose life is even more of a mess than his: a young, depressed, sexually repressed, anti-social novelist who lives in the local bus station because no one else will have him. Least of all his parents. Douglas, who smokes more dope in Wonder Boys than Jeff Bridges smoked in The Big Lebowski, reluctantly takes the prodigy under his wing.</p> <p>The results of their 48-hour liaison are comical but disastrous, leaving the chairman of the English department's blind dog dead and Douglas badly bitten in the calf area. Worse still, Maguire has made off with a prized trophy that the department head keeps stored in a bedroom safe that Douglas has foolishly opened: the tiny, fur-lined jacket that Marilyn Monroe wore the day she married baseball legend Joe DiMaggio.</p> <p>Bear in mind that the man's wife is already pregnant with Douglas's child. All in all, not a very good weekend. Stripped to its fundamentals, Wonder Boys is a coming-of-middle-age tale in which a talented writer finally realises that God-given talent can also be taken away, sometimes by God. As such, it has a certain wry appeal. </p> <p>Unlike most films about fabulously gifted novelists who have wasted their abilities - not that there are that many films in this genre - Wonder Boys is not hobbled by angst, ennui, anomie or any of the other novelistic emotions imported from the Continent. Moreover, it is not stupid, a virtually unparallelled achievement in American films about writers.</p> <p>All the same, Wonder Boys ultimately falls short of the mark. The fault, alas, lies in the casting. While Robert Downey Jr is perfect as the jaded, sexually perplexed, morally depleted book editor who has flown in for the weekend; and Frances McDormand exudes the kind of weary sexuality that is typical of academics' wives; and Rip Torn does yeoman service as the blustery hack who fancies himself the second coming of Emile Zola, and Tobey Maguire is positively adorable as the confused wunderkind, Michael Douglas simple cannot carry the load as the burned-out novelist.</p> <p>The reason he cannot carry the load is that Michael Douglas is too LA. No matter how old and jowly he gets, Douglas retains that buoyant Southern California demeanour and those Malibu Beach speech patterns. Proving, once again, that you can take the boy out of the surf, but you can't take the surf out of the boy.</p> <p>In an effort to make him seem more downscale and pathetic and more believable as a Pittsburghian, Hanson dresses him like a bum, gives him standard-issue props like reading glasses and ratty bathrobes and has him fall down a lot, but it's no go. Douglas is superb when he plays ruthless cops, predatory industrialists, unfaithful husbands, jaded lawyers.</p> <p>But cast as the author of a great American novel, Douglas is about as convincing as he was when he played a vaunted lion hunter in The Ghost And The Darkness. One has to admire his courage. But one has to question his judgment.</p> <p>Wonder Boys is out on Friday</p>",

Tobey Maguire, Frances McDormand, Rip Torn and Robert Downey Jr are all far better actors than Michael Douglas and discreetly outperform him here. But without Michael Douglas, movies like Wonder Boys don't get made. Or, if they do get made, they star somebody perfectly awful, like Kurt Russell. So we should all be thankful for small mercies. The term \"Wonder Boys\" refers to fabulously talented young male writers who may fail to live up to their youthful potential because life, drugs, alcohol, women or a combination of all four get in the way. Douglas was once a Wonder Boy: Seven years earlier he wrote a magnificent first novel entitled The Arsonist's Daughter and seemed destined for greatness. But now he is bogged down in a 2,612-page epic that does not appear to be about anything in particular, and it is not anywhere close to completion. He is no longer a Wonder Boy. He is now looking more like a precocious has-been. Worse still, his wife has just left him; his mistress (McDormand) - who happens to be his boss's wife - is pregnant; and his struggling New York editor (Downey) is coming to town to read the novel he has not finished writing, hoping to get his own career back on track. Into Douglas's life steps Tobey Maguire, a Wonder Boy whose life is even more of a mess than his: a young, depressed, sexually repressed, anti-social novelist who lives in the local bus station because no one else will have him. Least of all his parents. Douglas, who smokes more dope in Wonder Boys than Jeff Bridges smoked in The Big Lebowski, reluctantly takes the prodigy under his wing. The results of their 48-hour liaison are comical but disastrous, leaving the chairman of the English department's blind dog dead and Douglas badly bitten in the calf area. Worse still, Maguire has made off with a prized trophy that the department head keeps stored in a bedroom safe that Douglas has foolishly opened: the tiny, fur-lined jacket that Marilyn Monroe wore the day she married baseball legend Joe DiMaggio. Bear in mind that the man's wife is already pregnant with Douglas's child. All in all, not a very good weekend. Stripped to its fundamentals, Wonder Boys is a coming-of-middle-age tale in which a talented writer finally realises that God-given talent can also be taken away, sometimes by God. As such, it has a certain wry appeal. Unlike most films about fabulously gifted novelists who have wasted their abilities - not that there are that many films in this genre - Wonder Boys is not hobbled by angst, ennui, anomie or any of the other novelistic emotions imported from the Continent. Moreover, it is not stupid, a virtually unparallelled achievement in American films about writers. All the same, Wonder Boys ultimately falls short of the mark. The fault, alas, lies in the casting. While Robert Downey Jr is perfect as the jaded, sexually perplexed, morally depleted book editor who has flown in for the weekend; and Frances McDormand exudes the kind of weary sexuality that is typical of academics' wives; and Rip Torn does yeoman service as the blustery hack who fancies himself the second coming of Emile Zola, and Tobey Maguire is positively adorable as the confused wunderkind, Michael Douglas simple cannot carry the load as the burned-out novelist. The reason he cannot carry the load is that Michael Douglas is too LA. No matter how old and jowly he gets, Douglas retains that buoyant Southern California demeanour and those Malibu Beach speech patterns. Proving, once again, that you can take the boy out of the surf, but you can't take the surf out of the boy. In an effort to make him seem more downscale and pathetic and more believable as a Pittsburghian, Hanson dresses him like a bum, gives him standard-issue props like reading glasses and ratty bathrobes and has him fall down a lot, but it's no go. Douglas is superb when he plays ruthless cops, predatory industrialists, unfaithful husbands, jaded lawyers. But cast as the author of a great American novel, Douglas is about as convincing as he was when he played a vaunted lion hunter in The Ghost And The Darkness. One has to admire his courage. But one has to question his judgment. Wonder Boys is out on Friday",

      "body": "<p>The fairytale, lichen-encrusted oaks of Wistman's Wood are a bit of a mystery. Ecologists are still puzzled over why its wizened and gnarled trees, some of which are over 300 years old, are all of the lowland, pedunculate variety, whereas all those in the well-wooded valleys on the edge of the moor are the more hardy sessile oaks, usually found in the uplands of Britain. </p> <p>Another mystery is that this incredibly ancient-looking wood, which feels as though it has been there since the beginning of time, is on the move. Not only are its trees twice the height they used to be 80 years ago, but the wood itself has doubled in size over the past 60 years, and is slowly but surely creeping up the slopes of neighbouring Longaford Tor. </p> <p>This part of the mystery, however, is easier to solve. As the plentiful new acorns germinate, they are sheltered by the older trees from the prevailing westerly winds which are therefore responsible for gradually pushing the wood uphill. So despite its venerable and unchanging appearance, Wistman's Wood is what the ecologists call a \"dynamic ecosystem\". This arboreal enigma lies hidden away in the desolate valley of the West Dart river in the moorland heart of Dartmoor, near the National Park's epicentre at Two Bridges. For many it represents the essence of Dartmoor. </p> <p>While it is usually heralded by guidebooks as \"the last great wilderness of southern Britain\", Dartmoor's spirit is not necessarily to be found on the open, tor-topped moors, described by their most famous chronicler, Arthur Conan Doyle, as \"so vast, and so barren, and so mysterious\". </p> <p>Wistman's is thought to take its name from the old West Country word \"wisht\" which means sad or uncanny, so \"Wistman\" may mean \"Wisht-man\", and the wood may be named after a local, other-worldly spirit. Certainly, early Dartmoor antiquarians were keen to link this ancient oakwood with the activities of Celtic Druids, who were known to favour oak groves for their pagan ceremonies. </p> <p>But perhaps the most remarkable feature of Wistman's Wood, apart from its exposed position at 400m (1,300ft) above the sea, is its luxurious mantle of mosses, ferns, liverworts and lichens. They drip from the branches of the weirdly-contorted branches like the epiphytes and bromeliads of an Amazonian rain forest, and in fact represent a habitat which is every bit as rare and threatened. </p> <p>The loss of the rare and beautiful moss antitrichia curtipendula, which formerly hung in liana-like fronds from the branches of many of the trees in Victorian times, is blamed on the increase in airborne pollution, and the gradual opening-up of the wood has in turn caused a loss of humidity which has affected the moisture-loving ferns and liverworts. </p> <p>Wistman's Wood is now a National Nature Reserve managed by English Nature under agreement with the Duchy of Cornwall, and access is strictly by written permission only. However, a public footpath runs conveniently past the wood, and you can peep into it along this easy, three-mile stroll from Two Bridges. </p> <p>Start from the quarry car park on the side of the B3357, opposite the Two Bridges Hotel. The way leads clearly north along a track towards Crockern farmhouse, where a stile takes you out into open country and the first sighting of Wistman's Wood, low-lying like a hedge on the slopes of the valley ahead. </p> <p>The prominent rocks on the hillside to your left are Beardown Tors, parts of which make up the Merrivale Firing Range, still in use by the Army despite the fact it is now situated in a National Park supposedly set aside for the quiet enjoyment of the public. When a red flag is seen flying from the tors, firing is taking place and walking is forbidden on these hills. </p> <p>The winding artificial waterway that can just be seen contouring beneath the tors is the Devonport Leat, cut between 1793-96 to take water from the West Dart river, whose natural course flows down in the valley below, to the Burrator Reservoir and thence to the then fast-growing dockyard town of Devonport. </p> <p>As you step out across the rock-strewn moorland heading due north towards the approaching wind-stunted \"hedge\" of Wistman's Wood, you may notice some broken down walls and mounds emerging from the moorland grass. The map of Dartmoor is scattered with the words \"settlement\" and \"hut circle\" in that Gothic lettering the Ordnance Survey reserves for ancient monuments. These humps are all that remains of medieval and earlier villages and farms that once made Dartmoor one of the most populous places in the south west. </p> <p>Indeed, it is said to contain, \"fossilised\" under the moor grass, the most important and complete prehistoric landscape in north-west Europe. </p> <p>Walk around the top edge of the wood, looking inside at what one author has described as \"the ultimate in arboreal deformity\" and \"a phantasmagoria of greenleaf and granite\". Wistman's Wood covers about four hectares (8.5 acres), and its amazing survival is thought to be due to the fact that the trees have grown in the shelter of the rocky crevices of the \"clitter\" (the Dartmoor name for loose rocks). These create a favourable micro- climate, protecting the trees from gales and frost and, above all, from being nibbled by local sheep. </p> <p>When you reach the northern end of the wood, turn right and head steeply uphill to reach the rocky summit of Longaford Tor, from where a splendid view opens up to the north towards the 1,978ft (603m) Cut Hill, perhaps the most remote of the Dartmoor summits. The nearer tor is Higher White Tor, and between that and Longaford Tor are the remains of one of Dartmoor's enigmatic prehistoric stone rows. </p> <p>Take the ridge due south, crossing the strange, masonry-like blocks of Littaford Tors and down through gaps in the walls towards Crockern Tor. </p> <p>It is now a short step due west and downhill, passing some more pillow mounds, to reach Crockern again and your outward route back to Two Bridges. </p> <p><strong> The practicals </strong><br> </p> <p> Wistman's Wood is near Two Bridges in the centre of Dartmoor, off the B3357 Dartmeet-Tavistock road. The walk is approximately three miles in length and should take about 2 hours. It is over rough moorland, so appropriate footwear should be worn. Indispensable for any exploration of Dartmoor is the Ordnance Survey's 1:25,000 Outdoor Leisure Map No. 28, covering the National Park. The Two Bridges Hotel (tel: 01822 890581) has a beautiful riverside setting near the junction of the West Dart river with the Cowsic, and is very popular with walkers.

Can a night-flight be transformed from a punishing experiment in sleep deprivation into a travellers' treat, on a par with the old luxury night-trains of old? </p> <p>British Airways certainly hopes so. That's why it's equipped its club-class quarters with a perk that used to be confined to first: a flat-bed seat. Think of it as the latest offensive in the great furniture war of the air - a bed in the sky for every business-class passenger between London and New York. </p> <p>Personally, I couldn't resist. I've done that overnight run often, always in economy, emerging the next morning with aching limbs, matted hair, clingy trousers and a desperate need for slumber. Wouldn't it be great to dodge the entire experience by bedding down for the night at JFK and arriving in London fresh and ready for the new day? </p> <p>BA's new service is obsessed with achieving that outcome. Sleep is the goal, pursued relentlessly. There's pre-board dining in the newly-built Terraces lounge in JFK: that way you can eat first, wasting no valuable sleep time onboard. If you're one of those travellers who skids into the airport with seconds to spare - and no time for the lounge - then the on-board menu includes a sleep-well option (olive bread stuffed with beef and ricotta cheese, followed by hot chocolate and cookies). It's not so much food as a soporific. </p> <p>But the heart of the matter is the seat. It looks less like a chair than a pod. There are two seats in each unit, forming an S-shape - with a handy, fan-like screen to ensure no peeking between you and your neighbour (unless you want to). A TV screen swings out on a steel arm; there's a tiny little stand for cocktails as well as the regular tray table stowed in the seat arm. Also stashed away is a TV remote control, which doubles as a telephone, and a clutch of light-switches and gadgets.

You must keep pressing the button and keep pressing some more. For the chair bends further and further back (forcing you to move your bottom, lest your backside gets trapped in the chair like a foot in an escalator).

      "bodyText": "Can the red-eye be abolished forever? Can a night-flight be transformed from a punishing experiment in sleep deprivation into a travellers' treat, on a par with the old luxury night-trains of old? British Airways certainly hopes so. That's why it's equipped its club-class quarters with a perk that used to be confined to first: a flat-bed seat. Think of it as the latest offensive in the great furniture war of the air - a bed in the sky for every business-class passenger between London and New York. Personally, I couldn't resist. I've done that overnight run often, always in economy, emerging the next morning with aching limbs, matted hair, clingy trousers and a desperate need for slumber. Wouldn't it be great to dodge the entire experience by bedding down for the night at JFK and arriving in London fresh and ready for the new day? BA's new service is obsessed with achieving that outcome. Sleep is the goal, pursued relentlessly.

      "body": "<p>Vienna is the grand capital of music. Hadyn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert all thrived in its bubbling coffee-house culture and came to pay court to the Habsburgs and to each other. Today along the Kartnerstrasse, Vienna's central shopping street, busy Viennese still hover patiently as buskers tune up. Even the mobile phones chime. </p> <p>Now is a good time to ride Vienna's trams around the Ringstrasse, looping the old city. The opera season is starting and, with Christmas approaching, Vienna lights up like a sparkler. </p> <p>But the home of so much pleasure is also the city of Freud and that artistic reject Hitler; a place that can still cast truly grotesque shadows. For an outsider Vienna can be over-rich to say the least and, on a weekend break, penetrating its charmed musical circle is as intimidating as the overmighty Hofburg palace. Fear not though, Vienna is actually remarkably easy to get around. </p> <p><strong> Tuning up</strong></p> <p> Buy a <strong> Vienna Card</strong> (\u00a39 for three days - from underground stations and tobacconists) for unlimited use of trams, subway and discounts to most museums. For anyone vaguely nervous of all that noise, there is only one place to start. Just three months old, Vienna's newest, slickest, most hi-tech museum, the <strong> Haus der Musik</strong>, is a revelation. It starts with a computerised introduction to the sounds of music and music of sounds, and ends in a futuristic playground of sonic massages and sound morphing. You can even conduct the Vienna Philharmonic courtesy of a computer program masterminded by the university of Linz. </p> <p>For a genuine insight into what made all those metronomes tick, the coupes de theatre <strong> </strong> are the walk-through biographies of Vienna's seven great composers, from \"Papa\" Hadyn to Mahler and the dissonance of the 20th-century Viennese School. They brilliantly weave their stories into the fabric of the city and show how music, beginning in the churches, moved to the court and aristocratic salons, then through Schubert's open-air gatherings to the all-popular waltzes of the Strausses, preparing the way, in the collapse of empire and two world wars, for the shattering atonalities of the 20th century. \"When you hear a sound you are also hearing the space in which it is made.\" It couldn't be truer than in Vienna. </p> <p>Haus Der Musik, Seilerstatte 30. (+4315164851 <a href=\"http://www.houseofmusic-vienna.at\">www.houseofmusic-vienna.at</a>). Open 10am-10pm daily. Adults \u00a35, family ticket \u00a311. </p> <p> Next stop the <strong> Hofburg </strong> palace and an exhibition of 16th-century musical instruments, not just to touch bass but as an introduction to the Habs burgs. The winter palace of the Holy Roman emperor Franz Joseph, who defined the staggering pomp and circumstance of the 19th- century city, the Hofburg lies at Vienna's epicentre. It symbolises how this capital of an empire, once uniting 56 million people in the heart of the European maelstrom, became such a glittering focus for art and culture. </p> <p>The Hofburg could take a weekend in itself but a must on a short trip is the Hofburg Chapel where every Sunday morning you can hear the Vienna Boys Choir. Make sure to get a seat near the front, otherwise you will have to peer at those angelic faces on a monitor. </p> <p> Instruments of the 16th Century - National Library in the Hofburg Palace, Innere Stadt. Open 10am-5.30am except Tuesday. \u00a32.50. </p> <p> If the Hofburg testifies to the importance of patrons, it is the composers who play on and, armed with enough anecdotes, Vienna's drama explodes in the places they frequented. I didn't know Beethoven was always running upstairs or that Mozart spent a third of his life in carriages. </p> <p>Everywhere you'll see plaques to Vienna's musical worthies, but two of the most important pilgrimage sites are the <strong> Pasqualati House</strong> and <strong> The Figaro House</strong> . Beethoven - who moved house 97 times - found a burgherish patron in Herr Pasqualati. The charming Figaro House lies in cobbled streets behind the all-imposing St Stephen's, the only surviving residence of Vienna's best loved visitor, Wolfgang Amadeus. Under the baroque ceiling in his bedroom you do get a real sense of Mozart's (or perhaps Peter Schaffer's) Vienna. Headphones and digital harpsichords allow you to indulge in some of the greatest works in situ. </p> <p>It was the commercially-minded Strausses who really began to exploit popular music with their celebrated waltzes. Although the Danube is not and never has been blue, as you will see from the tributary that now forms Vienna's famous canal, you will hear the strains of waltzes everywhere. Vienna's ball season starts again too in November, although it doesn't reach its peak until January and February. </p> <p> PasqualatiHaus, Molkerbastei 8. FigaroHaus, Domgasse 5. Johann Strauss Memorial Rooms, Praterstrasse 54. All open 9am-12.15pm, 1pm-4.30pm Tues- Sun. Closed Jan 1, May 1 &amp; Dec 25. </p> <p><strong> Nights at the opera</strong><br> </p> <p> The two main concert halls are the <strong> Musikverein</strong> (1 B\u00f6sendorferstrasse 12, tel: 505 8190) and the <strong> Konzerthaus </strong> (3 Lothringerstrasse 3, tel: 712 1211), home of the Vienna Philharmonic and Symphony orchestras. </p> <p>But the high altar of musical culture is the splendid <strong> Staatsoper </strong> (1 Opernring 2, tel: 5144 42960), completely rebuilt in 1945. Sometimes, the humourless Viennese could do with the Marx brothers around, but for me there was no greater thrill than watching those deep-red curtains rise on a production of Verdi's Enani, as well-dressed Viennese showed their love, knowledge and appreciation in one of the world's greatest opera houses. Of course, seats are expensive but you can stand for around \u00a35 - if you can get tickets. </p> <p>Try, too, the <strong> Volksoper</strong> (9 W\u00e4hringerstrasse 78, tel: 51 444) - the People's Opera. Far more relaxed, it still reaches a high standard and you are more likely to hear the strains of Figaro or Don Giovanni drifting through the doors. </p> <p>For tickets to everything theatrical and musical, go to the Bundestheatrekassen (1 Hanuschgasse 3, down from the opera house, tel:5144 42960). </p> <p><strong> Tone deaf</strong><br> </p> <p> If music isn't your thing, Vienna has plenty of other attractions.

For lunch, <strong> Hansen</strong> (1 Wipplingerstrasse 34 in the basement of the Stock Exchange, tel: 532 0542) is trendy, the <strong> Cantino</strong> (at the top of the Haus der Musik) good, while <strong> Zum Zwarzen Kameel</strong> (1 Bognergasse 5, tel: 533 8967) is famous for its reislings and a still-unpaid bill of Beethoven's. </p> <p>If you are going to the opera, be careful because Vienna seems to close suprisingly early.

      "bodyText": "Vienna is the grand capital of music. Hadyn, Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert all thrived in its bubbling coffee-house culture and came to pay court to the Habsburgs and to each other. Today along the Kartnerstrasse, Vienna's central shopping street, busy Viennese still hover patiently as buskers tune up. Even the mobile phones chime. Now is a good time to ride Vienna's trams around the Ringstrasse, looping the old city. The opera season is starting and, with Christmas approaching, Vienna lights up like a sparkler. But the home of so much pleasure is also the city of Freud and that artistic reject Hitler; a place that can still cast truly grotesque shadows. For an outsider Vienna can be over-rich to say the least and, on a weekend break, penetrating its charmed musical circle is as intimidating as the overmighty Hofburg palace. Fear not though, Vienna is actually remarkably easy to get around. Tuning up Buy a Vienna Card (\u00a39 for three days - from underground stations and tobacconists) for unlimited use of trams, subway and discounts to most museums. For anyone vaguely nervous of all that noise, there is only one place to start. Just three months old, Vienna's newest, slickest, most hi-tech museum, the Haus der Musik, is a revelation. It starts with a computerised introduction to the sounds of music and music of sounds, and ends in a futuristic playground of sonic massages and sound morphing. You can even conduct the Vienna Philharmonic courtesy of a computer program masterminded by the university of Linz. For a genuine insight into what made all those metronomes tick, the coupes de theatre are the walk-through biographies of Vienna's seven great composers, from \"Papa\" Hadyn to Mahler and the dissonance of the 20th-century Viennese School. They brilliantly weave their stories into the fabric of the city and show how music, beginning in the churches, moved to the court and aristocratic salons, then through Schubert's open-air gatherings to the all-popular waltzes of the Strausses, preparing the way, in the collapse of empire and two world wars, for the shattering atonalities of the 20th century. \"When you hear a sound you are also hearing the space in which it is made.\" It couldn't be truer than in Vienna. Haus Der Musik, Seilerstatte 30. (+4315164851 www.houseofmusic-vienna.at). Open 10am-10pm daily. Adults \u00a35, family ticket \u00a311. Next stop the Hofburg palace and an exhibition of 16th-century musical instruments, not just to touch bass but as an introduction to the Habs burgs. The winter palace of the Holy Roman emperor Franz Joseph, who defined the staggering pomp and circumstance of the 19th- century city, the Hofburg lies at Vienna's epicentre. It symbolises how this capital of an empire, once uniting 56 million people in the heart of the European maelstrom, became such a glittering focus for art and culture. The Hofburg could take a weekend in itself but a must on a short trip is the Hofburg Chapel where every Sunday morning you can hear the Vienna Boys Choir. Make sure to get a seat near the front, otherwise you will have to peer at those angelic faces on a monitor. Instruments of the 16th Century - National Library in the Hofburg Palace, Innere Stadt. Open 10am-5.30am except Tuesday. \u00a32.50. If the Hofburg testifies to the importance of patrons, it is the composers who play on and, armed with enough anecdotes, Vienna's drama explodes in the places they frequented. I didn't know Beethoven was always running upstairs or that Mozart spent a third of his life in carriages. Everywhere you'll see plaques to Vienna's musical worthies, but two of the most important pilgrimage sites are the Pasqualati House and The Figaro House . Beethoven - who moved house 97 times - found a burgherish patron in Herr Pasqualati. The charming Figaro House lies in cobbled streets behind the all-imposing St Stephen's, the only surviving residence of Vienna's best loved visitor, Wolfgang Amadeus. Under the baroque ceiling in his bedroom you do get a real sense of Mozart's (or perhaps Peter Schaffer's) Vienna. Headphones and digital harpsichords allow you to indulge in some of the greatest works in situ. It was the commercially-minded Strausses who really began to exploit popular music with their celebrated waltzes. Although the Danube is not and never has been blue, as you will see from the tributary that now forms Vienna's famous canal, you will hear the strains of waltzes everywhere. Vienna's ball season starts again too in November, although it doesn't reach its peak until January and February. PasqualatiHaus, Molkerbastei 8. FigaroHaus, Domgasse 5. Johann Strauss Memorial Rooms, Praterstrasse 54. All open 9am-12.15pm, 1pm-4.30pm Tues- Sun. Closed Jan 1, May 1 &amp; Dec 25. Nights at the opera The two main concert halls are the Musikverein (1 B\u00f6sendorferstrasse 12, tel: 505 8190) and the Konzerthaus (3 Lothringerstrasse 3, tel: 712 1211), home of the Vienna Philharmonic and Symphony orchestras. But the high altar of musical culture is the splendid Staatsoper (1 Opernring 2, tel: 5144 42960), completely rebuilt in 1945. Sometimes, the humourless Viennese could do with the Marx brothers around, but for me there was no greater thrill than watching those deep-red curtains rise on a production of Verdi's Enani, as well-dressed Viennese showed their love, knowledge and appreciation in one of the world's greatest opera houses. Of course, seats are expensive but you can stand for around \u00a35 - if you can get tickets. Try, too, the Volksoper (9 W\u00e4hringerstrasse 78, tel: 51 444) - the People's Opera. Far more relaxed, it still reaches a high standard and you are more likely to hear the strains of Figaro or Don Giovanni drifting through the doors. For tickets to everything theatrical and musical, go to the Bundestheatrekassen (1 Hanuschgasse 3, down from the opera house, tel:5144 42960). Tone deaf If music isn't your thing, Vienna has plenty of other attractions. It is a city of theatres and museums, 90 in fact. A reason to go now is the exhibition in the Belvedere of Klimt's Women; a banquet of the painter's rich, jewelled colours, and decadent sensuality. To escape take a boat along the canal and loop out into the Danube. Klimt's Women, Belvedere, Landstrasse. Until Jan 7. Open 10am-6pm except Mondays. Thurs to 7pm. \u00a35. www.klimt-frauen.at. In Vienna, even the horses love to dance and though it's difficult to get tickets you can watch them training in the mornings at the Spanish Riding School (Hofburg, Josefplatz). Fiakers, Vienna's famous horse-drawn carriages, are very expensive and far better value is a personal guided tour. For some darker notes, try the Prater Park and the sounds of the funfair. From the famous Ferris wheel where Harry Lime spills the beans in The Third Man you can gaze out across the city, over to the UN building, housing among other things the Drug Control Agency. For film buffs there is also a guided tour down to the sewers, called The Return of The Third Man (tel: 585 6455). Where to eat Vienna is almost as famous for food as music. The Sacher Hotel (1 Philharmonikerstrasse 4, behind the Opera House, tel: 514 560) invented the sachertorte (chocolate cake) for Prince Metternich, and everywhere windows groan with pastries, puddings and sweets. This is all most pleasurable in the city's numerous coffee houses. Several boast musical associations but my favourites are the pink-fronted Caf\u00e9 Diglas (1, Wollzeile 10, tel: 512 8401), and Hawelka (1 Dorotheerhasse 6, tel: 512 8230), still frequented by artists and musicians. The tourist board has an excellent booklet of concert-caf\u00e9s. Caf\u00e9 Landtmann (1 Dr-Karl-Lueger-Ring 4, tel: 532 0621) was a favourite of Freud's and is great for music. You shouldn't leave Vienna without trying tafelspitz , a delicious Viennese beef stew, best at Plachutta (1 Wollzeile 38, tel: 512 1577). For lunch, Hansen (1 Wipplingerstrasse 34 in the basement of the Stock Exchange, tel: 532 0542) is trendy, the Cantino (at the top of the Haus der Musik) good, while Zum Zwarzen Kameel (1 Bognergasse 5, tel: 533 8967) is famous for its reislings and a still-unpaid bill of Beethoven's.

A traditional pre-opera tipple is a glass of champagne at the Reiss Bar ( Marco D'aviano-Gasse 1). For some real life and the street culture that fed all that genius, try the student bars around Juden Strasse. Where to stay As everything happens in the charmed inner circle, district number 1 is the only place to stay.

It was a short walk from the slopes, where a small gondola took you to the main ski station at Courchevel 1850. </p> <p>Unlike the functional but unattractive hub of the Trois Vall\u00e9es, we were staying in Courchevel 1550 - one of the five components of the resort that link to the 600km of pistes. Down the mountain from the jet-setting Courchevel 1850, we were in a small, quiet and attractive village, ideal for families and substantially cheaper. </p> <p>A short gondola ride or alternatively a regular bus service were all that separated the two areas - that is until it started to snow, and snow and snow. Later that night we watched the snow build on the balcony, and as the flakes grew to the size of a fist and the wind started to howl our first concerns set in. </p> <p>The next morning all was quiet, there was no hum from the gondola, our essential link to the main ski area, and the buses had stopped running. Eventually, a short Poma lift was opened, but it didn't go anywhere, all it did was justify the price of a lift ticket. We were well and truly cut off. </p> <p>In New York City, any real estate agent will tell you that the three most important factors to take into account when looking for accommodation are location, location, location. The same could well apply to ski resorts. Sadly though, the most attractive resorts may not have the best skiing or reliable public transport, while the most convenient may not be attractive. In many cases it comes down to what you are prepared to pay. </p> <p>Many of the purpose-built resorts are popular because they offer location and convenience at affordable prices. This doesn't mean that you should forego the pretty villages where the smell of manure wafts through the narrow cobbled streets and 400-year-old chalets groan from the passing of time, but that you should choose your alpine hideaway with care. </p> <p>In Austria, where many traditional alpine villages have barely changed and hotels have been modernised or expanded in good taste, there are many resorts that combine convenience, and an attractive village, and a few that can add excellent skiing to the list. </p> <p>In Switzerland, beware the antiquated four-star hotel. Last year, I went to Villars for the first time and found it a delightful location, with excellent skiing. But the so called four-star hotels, while meeting international standards, were tired and badly in need of renovation. </p> <p>Italian resorts such as Courmayeur and Cortina D'Ampezzo have it all, but there are many other attractive Italian centres such as Livigno and Gressoney where you can find charm and good, albeit mostly, intermediate skiing. In France you'll find the purpose-built resort as the gateway to many of the largest ski areas. </p> <p><strong> Pretty Alpbach, Austria</strong></p> <p> The classic chocolate-box village with old wooden chalets, a small attractive church, narrow streets, and two 16th-century hotels run by the same family for several generations. The skiing is mostly intermediate on the Wiedersbergerhorn reached by a free shuttle bus. It's typically Tyrolean - expect cream teas, lederhosen and accordion players rather than tequila slammers and hip-hop. </p> <p><strong> Who goes there: </strong></p> <p><strong>Crystal Holidays</strong> 0870 848 7000 <br><strong> Inghams </strong> 020-8780 4444 <br><strong> Made to Measure </strong> 01243 533333 <br><strong> Meg\u00e8ve, France</strong> </p> <p> An exclusive and chic resort that attracted the likes of Brigitte Bardot, Roger Vadim and other celebrities in the 1960s.

      "body": "<b>Via Dolorosa </b> is a monologue, ideally to be performed by its author. As the audience arrive, the author is at the side of the stage. When they are all in he begins to speak. <br> People always say that in the west we lead shallow lives. Our lives must be shallow because we live in countries where nobody believes in anything any more. All my life, I've been told \"Western civilisation? An old bitch gone in the teeth.\" And so people say, go to Israel. Because in Israel at least people are fighting. <p>In Israel, they're fighting for something they believe in. Israel is, first and foremost, a cause, the cause being a patch of land, north to south on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, lying like a small brown anchovy set down on a school atlas, to which the most persecuted people of modern times - perhaps the most persecuted people of all times - after the matchless catastrophe of the Holocaust rushed in the perfectly reasonable belief that they would never be safe until they had a country of their own. \"We appealed to the conscience of the world. The world has no conscience. We have no one but ourselves.\" The fight. The struggle. The historic destiny. The return of the people. The cause: life therefore having a meaning and shape that eludes the rest of us in the endless wash of \"What the hell are we doing here?\" In a single day, says an Israeli friend, he experiences events and emotions that would keep a Swede going for a year. </p> <p> Zionism being a movement with only a short history, and distinguished from other political movements of our time by the fact that it was invented by a playwright. Yes, Theodor Herzl, in 1894 takes a mere three weeks to write his play Das Neue Ghetto, in which the Jewish hero, struck down by his enemy, dies at curtain-fall, his last words ringing out through the darkened theatre: \"I want to get out! Out of the ghetto!\" Nine years later it is the same Herzl who is chairman of the World Zionist Congress when Lord Lansdowne, on behalf of the magnanimous British Empire, is generous enough to offer a small chunk of Uganda as a suitable place for the Jews to \"live and observe their national customs\". Incredibly, a fair number of delegates are hotly in favour - a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, and Africa, after all, is better than nothing - but the option is finally rejected on the grounds that Uganda does not have the spiritual quality the Jews require. From this moment on, the central argument is foreshadowed. Is this a Biblical mission? Or is Israel to be a secular state? Throughout the 80s, organizations like the Friends of Israel offer to pay for writers to visit their country. Later, my friend Philip Roth goes off his own bat and returns home inspired by his meeting with the settlers, those religious Jews who have turned their whole lives into an act of political defiance by establishing Jewish townships on hitherto Arab land. \"You've got to go, David. You've got to go and see it for yourself. These people are absolute lunatics. They're the maddest people I've ever met in my life. For any writer of fiction, they're the most wonderful material.\" \"But surely,\" I say to Philip, one of America's most gifted comic novelists, \"they're your material, not mine.\" \"Oh no,\" says Philip, \"You have no idea. These people are so crazy there's room enough for all of us.\" </p> <p> On all occasions I refuse. It is only now, it is only 10 years later that I realise, almost without noticing, that for some time my subject as a playwright has been faith. My subject is belief. And so it comes to seem appropriate - no, more than that, it comes to seem urgent - that the 50-year-old British playwright should finally visit the 50-year-old state. The week before, the Israeli novelist, David Grossman, comes to my house in Hampstead. He says that whenever he comes to London, he makes sure to walk on Hampstead Heath. \"I have some sort of mineral reaction to the place I don't get anywhere else in the world. Just to breathe the air makes me feel happy.\" Obscurely, I feel proud when he says this, as if somehow Grossman's happiness in Hampstead reflected credit on me, as if it were part of the glory of happening to be British to be able, rather casually, to offer foreigners the wonderfulness of Hampstead Heath. But \"mineral reaction\"? Grossman has thought so deeply about the problems of Israel and has lived so long with questions from people like me that he can't help wincing at my clumsiness. \"What you call the major problems of Israel can one day be solved. There will be a Palestinian state. When I said this 10 years ago, everyone told me I was crazy. But now in their hearts people know it will happen. There are huge issues. But they are essentially soluble. What is less soluble is the underlying moral question: how does a majority which itself has been historically unloved now deal fairly with an unloved Palestinian minority in their own midst? Are we mature enough, are we courageous enough to internalise the idea of equality?\" I say, surely this has always been the problem at the heart of Zionism. Israel is effectively a religious state. It now admits immigrants of only one faith. Won't it one day have to become a modern country, multi-cultural, like any other? </p> <p> Grossman smiles. \"Yes, but for us that's very difficult. I don't see it the way you do. I don't think you have to be religious to be a Jew. There is no God in my life, and I'm as Jewish as it's possible to be. If you want to understand Israel, look to the six day war. That war changed everything. Myself, I feel we were much more Jewish before 1967. That war destroyed our essential Jewishness, because up till then places and buildings and stones didn't mean anything to us. They weren't important. What mattered to us were ideas. </p> <p> \"Something very profound happened to Israel during the six day war. For the first time we seized land, we took land by conquest, and suddenly the religious Jew saw the Bible not as a historical story, but as a contemporary operations manual. Yes, I want Israelis to have access to the Wailing Wall, but I don't need to own it. Nor do I need to own any of these holy places. It's new this idea. That you have to own things. It's new and it's profoundly un-Jewish.\" On arrival in Tel-Aviv I am rushed down Californian highways in the company of Sigal Cohen, the young and humorous translator who will accompany me wherever I go. I had expected massive security precautions and I boast of the ease with which I have sailed through immigration. \"Yes,\" she says, \"Israel is a very easy country to get into but it's an impossible country to get out of.\" At my nasty western-style downtown hotel, my chief British Council host Keith Lawrence is waiting. He is very thin, like a teddy-boy with tapered trousers and a collarless jacket. Give him a tall, skinny latte and this could be Soho. He is the man who is bringing plays like Shopping and Fucking to Tel-Aviv. He keeps saying Tel-Aviv is sexy and a happening kind of place, especially for a beach bunny, and sometimes he refers, rather unexpectedly, to the 'buzz'. When I try to find out exactly what the buzz consists of, everyone tells me that it has mostly to do with sitting in cafes and fucking. Later somebody tells me that Tel-Aviv is the fucking capital of the world. </p> <p> No chance to observe, because I am off to eat baked sea-bream, in a stunning waterside restaurant in the nearby port of Jaffa, at the invitation of the Israeli theatre director Eran Baniel. Eran is a fine-looking man in his early 50s, bearded, articulate, in a black corduroy suit. Now we drink Rothschild's Red Merlot and discuss the profound divisions which have emerged between the secular and religious ways of life. At the foundation of the state, the religious orthodox were guaranteed a special status. Anyone who entered a yeshiva to study the Talmud was exempted from the army, and given a public salary. At the time, there were just 500 students, but by the early 1990s there were over 100,000, says Eran \"effectively living off the state for life\".</p> <p> \"For years,\" says Eran, \"the Jew believed that when the goy persecuted you, it gave you the right to shortchange him. Hence the racial stereotype of the Jew who smiles while he swindles you. Well now we are the goy. Israel is the goy. And the religious orthodox have become the thieving Jew. They go to whoever wants to be prime minister and say, yes, you can have our votes but only if you promise to give us our money. They don't serve in the army. They smile and smile, and rob the country blind.\" </p> <p>Eran, it is clear, is a secular Jew. His life was changed by his famous co-production of Romeo and Juliet. This was presented in the middle of Jerusalem. The Palestinians played the Capulets and the Jews played the Montagues. There were five months of rehearsal, with the Palestinian producer George Ibrahim in charge of the Capulets and with Eran directing the Montagues. The project took eight years to achieve. In this production the Capulets really hated the Montagues. This was not a production about love, but about hate. Neither side needed the rhetoric at the beginning. \"You know that bit,\" says Eran, \"where the two sides line up and sort of say \"Fuck you, Montague\" and \"Fuck you, Capulet\". Well, we cut all that. Because Israelis and Palestinians go straight to the emotion: you pick up a stone and throw it straight away.\" </p> <p> Eran says he never really understood the occupation until he did this job. \"Most Israelis,\" says Eran, \"don't even notice the Palestinians. They don't see them. Have you seen how Israelis drive? They don't drive. They own the road.\" His voice is rising now. \"Have you been to the Palestinian territories? Look how the water is allocated. In the settlements, you have the obscene spectacle of Israelis sitting by their swimming pools while Palestinians carry their drinking water round in jerry cans.\" He uses a phrase I have heard before. \"It's un-Jewish, it's un-Jewish behaviour.\" By chance, a play of mine, Amy's View, is currently rehearsing at the Cameri, one of Israel's foremost theatres. Next morning I kick my way through the litter-strewn streets to meet the cast, who have two hours of questions. At one point I say the play is about how we no longer expect society to validate our beliefs. Our only values are private values. The last line of the play is: \"So. We're alone.\" Israel, I say, may be the worst place in the world to perform the play since here people are still arguing passionately about where their country is heading. Whereas in England Tony Blair represents all things to all men. What does he believe? Nobody knows. What will he do? Whatever is popular. Where is he heading? He never tells us. At once, an Israeli actor interrupts: \"Oh please, please, send us your Tony Blair.\" </p> <p> In fact, theatre is making me impatient because I am longing to get going and spend Sabbath in the Jewish settlement of Sheri Tikva which lies some miles inside the borders of the Palestinian territory. It takes us hours to push our way out of town on a Friday afternoon, in the pre-Sabbath rush, but finally Tel-Aviv falls away, and the road opens out. I think of my Sunday school, Sunday afternoons in a stuffy wooden hall in Bexhill-on-Sea. I look from the window of the car and the pale, stony landscape of dusty hills and olive-groves feels familiar, like a drawing from memory. </p> <p>I have now to be careful, because 10 minutes later a feeling arrives, unbidden. My mind is slipping, I am dreaming, perhaps of Israeli wine and fresh fish, when suddenly, in open country at last, it occurs to me, as I look out the window, that the Jews do not belong here. This thought is so unexpected and of course implicitly so inflammatory that I turn guiltily, blushing, to see whether anyone in the back of the car can tell what I'm thinking. Up till now I have spent time in Tel-Aviv, a town which, on its surface at least, is sophisticated and western, but now I am speeding through a huge land mass - I feel the topography, I feel the land, a great hot continent stretching away to my right, Arab country after Arab country - and for the first time I understand how odd, how egregious Israel must look to the Arab eye. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,390205,00.html\">Extract two</a></p>",

And when consumers were asked where they would go if money were no object, Australia won hands down (see the table right). It was chosen by 22%, followed by the United States with 11%.

Our moral custodians have unerringly erred on the side of caution, seizing anything remotely perturbing with a vigilance bordering on the fanatical, and justifying their actions legally with grey terms like \"corrupt\" and \"deprave\". </p> <p>So what's changed? About four years ago, police informed the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) that material being released as R18 (ie hardcore porn) was actually too tame to merit the description, and therefore misleading. New guidelines were half implemented, but then Jack Straw entered the Home Office and effectively reversed the process. </p> <p>A ping-pong match of appeals, refusals and judicial reviews ensued, and to everyone's surprise, the courts ruled that watching sex on TV really didn't harm many people (repetitive strain injury aside). \"We don't sit in our ivory tower and say what people should watch,\" says Sue Clark of the BBFC, which recently undertook an extensive public survey. \"We still have some of the strictest censorship rules in the world, but now we effectively accept that adults should be allowed to decide what they want to watch.\"</p> <p>So here we are, officially relaxed and eager to watch anything we once couldn't. As any record producer knows, an official ban is the best publicity one could hope for, which explains why any film with a vague whiff of scandal attached to it is now being sprung from the vaults. </p> <p>To put the record straight, though, the BBFC does not \"ban\" films. It classifies them, or doesn't as the case may be, and local authorities decide whether or not to screen them. This was the case with \"cult erotic dramas\" like The Story Of O, a kinky confection of Ferrero Rocher styling and consensual sado-masochism that caused a stir in 1975 and finally received a UK release this year. </p> <p>Director Just Jaeckin, who also directed the equally notorious Emmanuelle (which received a certificate, with cuts), has fond but vague memories of the film: \"For me, it was a beautiful story about love. It was not corrupting or pornographic, it was a fantasy, like Alice In Wonderland. But erotic, of course.\" </p> <p>While it's unlikely The Story Of O or Emmanuelle could have corrupted anyone, it's also quite a stretch to imagine that they could have aroused anyone either. Apart from crimes against interior design, the only real reason to suppress them was so that bands like Air could rip off their soundtracks undetected.</p> <p>Jaeckin's films did, however, show others the way to get sex onto cinema screens: make your film foreign and try to have some kind of plot. \"Arthouse\" has always been a way of evading the censors' scissors. Nagisa Oshima's In The Realm Of The Senses was passed in 1991 (only a 15-year wait), and the old erect-penis taboo was later lifted for Lars Von Trier's The Idiots, and Leos Carax's Pola X. </p> <p>Catherine Breillat's Romance, in many ways an updated Emmanuelle, has as many erections as an R18 film, but was passed for cinema release virtually uncut. Pasolini's Salo has fared less well. Despite impeccable arthouse credentials, its blend of perverted sex, sadistic violence and coprophilia went down as well as an excrement souffle with the authorities, despite the fact that its themes of repression, consumption and sexuality were serious-minded.</p> <p>Currently up for reclassification, it was seized by police when shown uncut at a Soho cinema in 1977 - narrowly staving off a nationwide outbreak of faeces-eating. </p> <p>The only films truly banned in the UK were the infamous \"video nasties\" of the 80s. In this instance, the Department of Public Prosecutions stepped in to staunch the Betamax bloodbath which the BBFC was powerless to stop, and prosecuted about 60 films, including future classics such as The Driller Killer, The Evil Dead and Andy Warhol's Flesh For Frankenstein (Texas Chainsaw Massacre was not on the list, although it had been refused a certificate since 1975). </p> <p>The \"but horror films are supposed to be scary\" argument didn't wash; a racy title or a lurid cover was enough (like the relatively tame I Miss You Hugs And Kisses, unwisely tagged \"for those who like their sex with a lot of violence\"). </p> <p>In the sober light of the 21st century, the majority of these low-budget splatterdramas are more hilarious than disgusting - such as Forest Of Fear, in which hippies become zombies after the FBI sprays their weed with an experimental herbicide, or Night Of The Demon, in which a victim is disembowelled by bigfoot, then whipped with his own intestines in slow motion. </p> <p>There are still many uncertified titles, some of which are unlikely to ever see the light of day, but others only remain \"banned\" because they are so bad nobody has bothered to re-submit them.

We are allowed to buy R18 videos but not receive them by mail, or bring them from abroad. And what we consider 18-certificate material, our European counterparts regularly classify as 15 or even 12. European porn producers still tone down their films for the UK market. </p> <p>Perhaps another side-effect of this liberation is the consequences for eroticism as opposed to pornography. With a rising background-smut count - thanks to increasingly sexualised advertising, television, magazines - pornography is scuttling up the hardcore ladder into bizarre, almost medical realms.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The notice by the museum entrance said: \"Iranians 500 tumans, Foreigners 5,000.\" Ali, my guide, interpreter and general fixer was asking the unshaven attendant in the kiosk for tickets. </p> <p>\"One Iranian and one foreigner.\" </p> <p>The official looked puzzled. \"Where's the foreigner?\" </p> <p>Ali pointed to me. </p> <p>\"Oh, I thought that was your Iranian grandfather.\" </p> <p>I was wondering whether to be offended by the insult - surely I don't look ancient and decrepit enough to be the grandfather of an overweight 26-year-old - when the ticket-seller addressed me in such fast colloquial Persian that, though my command of the language is better than it has any right to be after 30 years of disuse, I couldn't quite catch his drift. Before I could stop myself, I had cupped my hand to my ear and, in the quavering, piping voice of an old, deaf and stupid grandfather, was asking: \"What? What?\" </p> <p>\"You ... are ... welcome ... Sir,\" the man said very slowly, loudly and patronisingly. \"May ... you ... never ... be ... weary!\" It's a common enough Persian greeting, but he seemed to me to say it more pointedly than necessary. I consoled myself with the thought that I had saved myself 4,500 tumans (about $25) . Over the next 10 days, as we toured the country in Ali's clapped-out Fiat, playing the Iranian grandfather was to save me a lot more money, as well as getting me into the kind of cheap lodging-house that wasn't willing to take foreigners. This was lucky, since I was visiting the country at a time of year when most decent hotels are full. </p> <p>Having come to Iran to look at pre-Islamic sites for a book about the ancient Persian prophet Zoroaster, I particularly wanted to witness the Persian New Year celebrations, still strongly Zoroastrian in tone in spite of nearly 1,300 years of Islam. This is the most popular holiday of the Iranian year and the Lonely Planet Guide suggested that it was not the best time for a visit: \"You should seriously consider avoiding Iran altogether for about 10 days before and after Noruz, the chaotic Iranian New Year, which starts on or about 21st March.\" </p> <p>Ignoring this advice, my plan was to spend 10 days driving in a great circle around the country. Iran is a difficult country to travel in. Neither trains nor planes seem to serve the most sought-after destinations, and I had no idea of the condition of the roads. It was going to be touch and go whether I would make it back to Tehran in time for my return flight and my daughter's birthday back home. </p> <p>The start was inauspicious. Daylight-saving time began the day I arrived, and I dutifully set my watch forward. The next morning we were to set off at six, but Ali was more than an hour late. He laughed when I pointed to the clock on the hotel lobby wall. \"We don't work for the government,\" he protested. \"And the Mullahs don't control the sun.\" </p> <p>Nor, it seems, the roads. After two hours' playing dodgem through Tehran's insane morning traffic I was genuinely relieved to find myself still alive. No self-respecting Iranian driver will forego overtaking just because another vehicle is coming the other way. Two lanes are expected to accommodate three cars, or even trucks, abreast, even if it means scraping through, hooting like mad, with only inches to spare on either side. </p> <p>Starting out, you can't help holding your breath and gripping the seat, white knuckled, at the hairiest moments. But there is a limit to the number of times you can brace yourself for certain death. In the end you learn to say, with the Iranians, Masha'allah: whatever God wills. </p> <p>Our first, 500-mile drive south through the rolling desert took us to the oasis city of Yazd, with its unique skyline of tall wind towers, designed to catch any faint breaths of breeze and funnel them down into secret retreats at the heart of the huddle of mud-brick houses. We spent the next day visiting Yazd's spectacular mosques, its prison attributed to Alexander the Great and its Zoroastrian fire-temple, packed during Noruz with Iranian tourists craning to catch a sight, through the protective glass, of the sacred fire which has been burning continuously since AD 470, though not in this same place. </p> <p>A few years ago after a great windstorm, Yazdis were amazed to see the top of a dome peek out of the sand just outside town. Much digging exposed an entire buried village, perfectly preserved, complete with a fire-temple of its own. During our visit, a local family party arrived. The father, who seemed to have insider knowledge, was lecturing his wife and daughter about Zoroastrian beliefs in the wildly theatrical style Iranians use when reciting verse - drawling out the long vowels as if eating them, peppering each sentence with sudden loud phrases or unexpectedly ... slowing ... right ... down. I whispered to Ali that this must surely be a schoolteacher by trade. The man heard me and turned on us. </p> <p>\"Were you speaking English?\" </p> <p>Ali confessed. The man pointed at me. </p> <p>\"Is he British? Because there are some things that should not be spoken in front of some people.\" </p> <p>\"Well,\" Ali told him, \"he carries a British passport, but his family came from Czechoslovakia and he himself was born in Vienna.\" </p> <p>The schoolteacher looked at me a little more benignly. \"Then his sins are diminished.\" </p> <p>Afterwards I said to Ali \"I thought it was the Americans who were the Great Satan.\" </p> <p>\"Oh no,\" he explained, \"Iranians believe that the Americans are good people at heart but innocent and na\u00efve. It is always the British who command them to do bad things.\" </p> <p>The first threat to our tight schedule came on my third Iranian night. All hotels in Yazd being full, we were sleeping on the living room floor of a local man's basement flat. Generously hospitable like all Iranians, he brought out a hookah and a brace of bottles of wine for his guests. </p> <p>\"Alcohol? Isn't that against the law?\" </p> <p>\"I don't drink it for enjoyment, only for health,\" he emphasised, as if that made all the difference. \"Anyway, it's not made from grapes, but from pomegranates and honey.\" The first taste confirmed that nobody could drink it for enjoyment. </p> <p>The resulting hangovers delayed our next day's departure south over the mountains until noon, so that it was too dark to see anything by the time we reached Cyrus the Great's tomb at Pasagard and the spectacular remains of Persepolis, the summer capital founded by Darius and burned by Alexander. My executive decision was to press on to Shiraz and return again very early the next morning. </p> <p>Even at 10 o'clock, Shiraz, elegant city of palaces, poets and perfumed gardens, was like a madhouse. All of Iran seemed to have congregated there for Noruz. Festive crowds pressed along the decorated streets, while gaily-dressed wedding parties, the women's black chadors barely concealing their finery, crammed on to the backs of lorries and paraded through the city centre, shouting and hooting and blaring raucous wind instruments. </p> <p>After two hours of fruitless driving around to find a vacant hotel room, Ali regretfully conceded that we would have to make do with a common lodging house. He found the Heavenly Guesthouse near the central glittering Sayyed Mir Ahmad shrine but came out looking gloomy. </p> <p>\"You won't like it,\" he said. </p> <p>I didn't. The tiny room, with space only for a double bed and a washbasin, was so filthy that Ali suggested we avoid undressing. The smell of urine forced us to leave the window open, and rowdy wedding parades outside kept us awake till three. It was no hardship to be up again and ready to leave town at five. </p> <p>Lost time was impossible to make up, however. Though we were back shortly after seven at Cyrus's movingly simple and dignified tomb, the entrance gates to the site were locked and, in spite of my offer of money and Ali's improbable claims of high political influence, a dishevelled and bad-tempered official refused us admission for nearly two hours. </p> <p>Late that night, we were 200 miles behind schedule when exhaustion forced us to stop in a small town on the road, at a guest house which proved to be, if anything, even more awful than the one in Shiraz. </p> <p>In the morning I asked Ali the name of the place. \"I want to be sure never to come here again.\" </p> <p>\"Beh-behan,\" he said. \"Literally, it means 'Used-to-be-better'.\" </p> <p>Driving on that night into the hours of darkness turned our careering descent to the oilfields of Mesopotamia into an awesome light show. Gigantic gas flares sprang from the ground on all sides, painting the entire sky a flickering rose red, as if we were entering the gates of Hell. It was almost a surprise to arrive unscathed in the cool modern urbanity of the great oil town of Ahwaz. </p> <p>Next day, it was an even greater surprise to be thoroughly frisked on leaving the slick shopping mall by the banks of the Karun river, though Ali took the indignity for granted. \"Otherwise people would steal things,\" he said. </p> <p>But even Ali was taken aback when the best hotel in town refused to change my dollars at a respectable rate, on the grounds that some of them were more than a year old. The cashier claimed to be worried. \"Perhaps they are not valid any more.\" </p> <p>I suggested that the day that two-year-old dollar bills went out of date, the world economy might as well close down. \"Why?\" he asked. \"Here we change our money all the time.\" </p> <p>By the time we had reached the nine o'clock position in our 360 degree circumnavigation of the country, we were falling ever more behind schedule. We had to press on far into the night to reach Shush, the site of Susa, one of oldest and longest-lasting of ancient Iran's cities - and one that took the brunt of the enemy onslaught during the Iran-Iraq war. The dusty hill of ruins which was once the biblical Shushan stands opposite the supposed tomb of the Prophet Daniel, the forecourt of which - for the benefit, I suppose, of Jewish pilgrims - is daubed with a huge savage mural, in uncannily Belfast-like style, showing heroic Muslims capturing Jerusalem. Close by is a gruesome blood-and-guts exhibition memorialising the martyrs to Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>Leaving the ancient mound, I was so affected by this combination of ruthlessness and horror that I quite forgot my Iranian grandfather role - until three angry men came running up to stop us in the street. Too late, I realised that I had been speaking English. </p> <p>\"You didn't say you were with a foreigner when you bought tickets,\" their spokesman accused Ali aggressively. </p> <p>\"You didn't ask.\" </p> <p>\"Foreigners must pay 10,000 tumans.\" </p> <p>Ali was squaring up for an argument. \"There is no sign that says so.\" </p> <p>The two others were beginning to look belligerent. I feared they might call the police and that I would never get back to Tehran in time to catch my plane. </p> <p>\"Pay them the money and let's go,\" I said. </p> <p>Ali did, but with ill grace. \"It's $57. You know the money will go straight into their pockets.\" </p> <p>\"But I don't want to miss my daughter's birthday.\" </p> <p>By driving through the night, we somehow managed to visit the carved cliffsides near Kermanshah and the ancient city of Hamadan as planned, and still arrive back in Tehran on the right day. With huge relief I checked in at Mehrabad airport well on time. </p> <p>The check-in clerk looked sombre. \"I am sorry,\" he said. \"Your flight is being diverted via Baku. You are going to miss your connection to London. The airline will pay for your overnight hotel in Dubai.\" </p> <p>I protested, of course. But this time there was absolutely nothing I could do. </p> <p>\u0095 In Search of Zarathustra, Paul Kriwaczek's look at the influence of the ancient Persian prophet on world religions, will be published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson in 2001.</p> <p><strong> Visa</strong><br> </p> <p> You can apply for a tourist visa at the Iranian consulate in London (Kensington Court, London W8, tel: 020-7937 5225), for a non-returnable fee of \u00a340.

      "bodyText": "The notice by the museum entrance said: \"Iranians 500 tumans, Foreigners 5,000.\" Ali, my guide, interpreter and general fixer was asking the unshaven attendant in the kiosk for tickets. \"One Iranian and one foreigner.\" The official looked puzzled. \"Where's the foreigner?\" Ali pointed to me. \"Oh, I thought that was your Iranian grandfather.\" I was wondering whether to be offended by the insult - surely I don't look ancient and decrepit enough to be the grandfather of an overweight 26-year-old - when the ticket-seller addressed me in such fast colloquial Persian that, though my command of the language is better than it has any right to be after 30 years of disuse, I couldn't quite catch his drift. Before I could stop myself, I had cupped my hand to my ear and, in the quavering, piping voice of an old, deaf and stupid grandfather, was asking: \"What? What?\" \"You ... are ... welcome ... Sir,\" the man said very slowly, loudly and patronisingly. \"May ... you ... never ... be ... weary!\" It's a common enough Persian greeting, but he seemed to me to say it more pointedly than necessary. I consoled myself with the thought that I had saved myself 4,500 tumans (about $25) . Over the next 10 days, as we toured the country in Ali's clapped-out Fiat, playing the Iranian grandfather was to save me a lot more money, as well as getting me into the kind of cheap lodging-house that wasn't willing to take foreigners. This was lucky, since I was visiting the country at a time of year when most decent hotels are full. Having come to Iran to look at pre-Islamic sites for a book about the ancient Persian prophet Zoroaster, I particularly wanted to witness the Persian New Year celebrations, still strongly Zoroastrian in tone in spite of nearly 1,300 years of Islam. This is the most popular holiday of the Iranian year and the Lonely Planet Guide suggested that it was not the best time for a visit: \"You should seriously consider avoiding Iran altogether for about 10 days before and after Noruz, the chaotic Iranian New Year, which starts on or about 21st March.\" Ignoring this advice, my plan was to spend 10 days driving in a great circle around the country. Iran is a difficult country to travel in. Neither trains nor planes seem to serve the most sought-after destinations, and I had no idea of the condition of the roads. It was going to be touch and go whether I would make it back to Tehran in time for my return flight and my daughter's birthday back home. The start was inauspicious. Daylight-saving time began the day I arrived, and I dutifully set my watch forward. The next morning we were to set off at six, but Ali was more than an hour late. He laughed when I pointed to the clock on the hotel lobby wall. \"We don't work for the government,\" he protested. \"And the Mullahs don't control the sun.\" Nor, it seems, the roads. After two hours' playing dodgem through Tehran's insane morning traffic I was genuinely relieved to find myself still alive. No self-respecting Iranian driver will forego overtaking just because another vehicle is coming the other way. Two lanes are expected to accommodate three cars, or even trucks, abreast, even if it means scraping through, hooting like mad, with only inches to spare on either side. Starting out, you can't help holding your breath and gripping the seat, white knuckled, at the hairiest moments. But there is a limit to the number of times you can brace yourself for certain death. In the end you learn to say, with the Iranians, Masha'allah: whatever God wills. Our first, 500-mile drive south through the rolling desert took us to the oasis city of Yazd, with its unique skyline of tall wind towers, designed to catch any faint breaths of breeze and funnel them down into secret retreats at the heart of the huddle of mud-brick houses. We spent the next day visiting Yazd's spectacular mosques, its prison attributed to Alexander the Great and its Zoroastrian fire-temple, packed during Noruz with Iranian tourists craning to catch a sight, through the protective glass, of the sacred fire which has been burning continuously since AD 470, though not in this same place. A few years ago after a great windstorm, Yazdis were amazed to see the top of a dome peek out of the sand just outside town. Much digging exposed an entire buried village, perfectly preserved, complete with a fire-temple of its own. During our visit, a local family party arrived. The father, who seemed to have insider knowledge, was lecturing his wife and daughter about Zoroastrian beliefs in the wildly theatrical style Iranians use when reciting verse - drawling out the long vowels as if eating them, peppering each sentence with sudden loud phrases or unexpectedly ... slowing ... right ... down. I whispered to Ali that this must surely be a schoolteacher by trade. The man heard me and turned on us. \"Were you speaking English?\" Ali confessed. The man pointed at me. \"Is he British? Because there are some things that should not be spoken in front of some people.\" \"Well,\" Ali told him, \"he carries a British passport, but his family came from Czechoslovakia and he himself was born in Vienna.\" The schoolteacher looked at me a little more benignly. \"Then his sins are diminished.\" Afterwards I said to Ali \"I thought it was the Americans who were the Great Satan.\" \"Oh no,\" he explained, \"Iranians believe that the Americans are good people at heart but innocent and na\u00efve.

      "body": "<p>It's 6.45am, and there's a gentle tapping on the door. You might be on holiday, but on Denis Island in the Seychelles it's time to get up and go fishing. </p> <p>On the beach, a dozen yards from the veranda, is Mayjoe, impatient in his Aston Villa shorts. He and the skipper, Etienne, have a lot of fish to catch and they want to get going before the pearly morning light is consumed by the heat of the tropical sun. </p> <p>Three miles from shore, Etienne cuts the engine and Mayjoe helps set up the lines. A weight and five baited hooks are attached to a fine nylon rope. It's tossed overboard, unravelling to a depth of 50m, and secured in your hand. You sit back and wait for a tug on your forefinger. This comes soon and it comes often: fishing in the Indian ocean does not require a huge amount of skill. Bonito, red snapper, parrot fish, capitaine blanc, job fish, groupier, the occasional baby shark - they're all delicious and waiting to be caught. At the end of the day, there is an absurd sense of pride in seeing your fish served for dinner. </p> <p>Denis Island relies on the well-stocked sea surrounding its 2 sq kms to feed its guests. Privately owned, there is nothing on the island apart from the lodge and a farm which supplies it with pork, chickens, eggs, vegetables and fruit. Everything else comes from the sea or is flown in on the 20-seater plane which lands on the 900m grass airstrip four times a week. </p> <p>It is precisely this remoteness that makes Denis so special. Three degrees south of the equator and 95km from Mahe, the main island of the Seychelles, the coral atoll is the kind of place you dream of on a dreary October afternoon stuck at your desk. As the plane approaches, you can see from your window a crescent of lush green, bordered by blindingly white sand, ringed by turquoise water skimming over coral, set in the deep blue ocean. The island is rich in vegetation and, like all the Seychelles, a haven for birds. </p> <p>Touchdown on the grass airstrip - used most of the time for either grazing cattle or practising golf shots - is not for the fainthearted, but once on the ground you are reassured by the friendly greeting of Denis's staff and the offer of cold towels and fresh fruit juice. </p> <p>The lodge - 10 minutes walk from the airstrip - prides itself on informality, urging its guests to make themselves at home. Several things mark it out from a conventional hotel: principally the feeling that the whole island is yours for the duration of your stay. There are no locks on the doors of the 25 \"cottages\" scattered among the trees along the beaches - there is no need, according to the lodge, as the island's resident population of about 40 all work either at the hotel or the farm. There are no televisions, radios or phones in the rooms, and the island is just out of range for the use of mobiles. Messages from the outside world can get through, but most people don't want to be disturbed. </p> <p>Richard, the Welsh barman at the lodge, had been on Denis for four weeks, having escaped from a pub in Aldershot by tracking down and securing his desert island dream on the internet. \"The world could be ablaze and I'd know nothing about it,\" he said. He spends his freetime swimming and snorkelling. </p> <p>The lodge operates only on a full-board basis - there is nowhere else to eat on the island. Breakfast and lunch are both buffets, with guests often eating barefoot. Dinner is less casual, although unlike many exclusive hotels there is no obligation to dress up. There is always a choice of three main courses including a meat option, and the food is fabulous: vodka-cured tuna; fish baked in spicy creole sauce; octopus and coconut curry, exotic fruits and home-baked bread. </p> <p>Drinks are added to your bill, and you could end up with a reasonably hefty charge at the end of your stay depending on your taste: beers are cheap, cocktails expensive. But, apart from drinks, scuba-diving and deep-sea fishing, there is literally nothing on the island to spend money on. The lodge has a tiny shop, selling trin kets and a few essentials; there are shelves of books in the bar for guests to borrow; billiards, table-tennis, backgammon and chess-sets are available for those who have not quite reached the empty-minded, staring-out-to-sea, completely-chilled condition that is what Denis is really all about. </p> <p>Once you have reached that state, the best place to be is on the beach. If the stretch of brilliant sand in front of your cottage is not deserted enough, you can easily find a real Robinson Crusoe experience elsewhere on the island.

      "bodyText": "It's 6.45am, and there's a gentle tapping on the door. You might be on holiday, but on Denis Island in the Seychelles it's time to get up and go fishing. On the beach, a dozen yards from the veranda, is Mayjoe, impatient in his Aston Villa shorts. He and the skipper, Etienne, have a lot of fish to catch and they want to get going before the pearly morning light is consumed by the heat of the tropical sun. Three miles from shore, Etienne cuts the engine and Mayjoe helps set up the lines. A weight and five baited hooks are attached to a fine nylon rope. It's tossed overboard, unravelling to a depth of 50m, and secured in your hand. You sit back and wait for a tug on your forefinger. This comes soon and it comes often: fishing in the Indian ocean does not require a huge amount of skill. Bonito, red snapper, parrot fish, capitaine blanc, job fish, groupier, the occasional baby shark - they're all delicious and waiting to be caught. At the end of the day, there is an absurd sense of pride in seeing your fish served for dinner. Denis Island relies on the well-stocked sea surrounding its 2 sq kms to feed its guests. Privately owned, there is nothing on the island apart from the lodge and a farm which supplies it with pork, chickens, eggs, vegetables and fruit. Everything else comes from the sea or is flown in on the 20-seater plane which lands on the 900m grass airstrip four times a week. It is precisely this remoteness that makes Denis so special. Three degrees south of the equator and 95km from Mahe, the main island of the Seychelles, the coral atoll is the kind of place you dream of on a dreary October afternoon stuck at your desk. As the plane approaches, you can see from your window a crescent of lush green, bordered by blindingly white sand, ringed by turquoise water skimming over coral, set in the deep blue ocean. The island is rich in vegetation and, like all the Seychelles, a haven for birds. Touchdown on the grass airstrip - used most of the time for either grazing cattle or practising golf shots - is not for the fainthearted, but once on the ground you are reassured by the friendly greeting of Denis's staff and the offer of cold towels and fresh fruit juice. The lodge - 10 minutes walk from the airstrip - prides itself on informality, urging its guests to make themselves at home. Several things mark it out from a conventional hotel: principally the feeling that the whole island is yours for the duration of your stay. There are no locks on the doors of the 25 \"cottages\" scattered among the trees along the beaches - there is no need, according to the lodge, as the island's resident population of about 40 all work either at the hotel or the farm. There are no televisions, radios or phones in the rooms, and the island is just out of range for the use of mobiles. Messages from the outside world can get through, but most people don't want to be disturbed. Richard, the Welsh barman at the lodge, had been on Denis for four weeks, having escaped from a pub in Aldershot by tracking down and securing his desert island dream on the internet. \"The world could be ablaze and I'd know nothing about it,\" he said. He spends his freetime swimming and snorkelling. The lodge operates only on a full-board basis - there is nowhere else to eat on the island. Breakfast and lunch are both buffets, with guests often eating barefoot. Dinner is less casual, although unlike many exclusive hotels there is no obligation to dress up. There is always a choice of three main courses including a meat option, and the food is fabulous: vodka-cured tuna; fish baked in spicy creole sauce; octopus and coconut curry, exotic fruits and home-baked bread. Drinks are added to your bill, and you could end up with a reasonably hefty charge at the end of your stay depending on your taste: beers are cheap, cocktails expensive. But, apart from drinks, scuba-diving and deep-sea fishing, there is literally nothing on the island to spend money on. The lodge has a tiny shop, selling trin kets and a few essentials; there are shelves of books in the bar for guests to borrow; billiards, table-tennis, backgammon and chess-sets are available for those who have not quite reached the empty-minded, staring-out-to-sea, completely-chilled condition that is what Denis is really all about. Once you have reached that state, the best place to be is on the beach. If the stretch of brilliant sand in front of your cottage is not deserted enough, you can easily find a real Robinson Crusoe experience elsewhere on the island. It takes about two hours to walk round Denis, and for most of that time you will be entirely alone among the crabs and driftwood. Take some flippers and a snorkel, and you can spend hours floating face down in the warm sea gazing at fluorescent fish darting in and out of the coral. The cottages are generously spaced and roomy. Each has a large veranda facing the sea, a sitting area and a big bathroom with disturbing floor-to-ceiling windows and glass door leading to a tiny walled courtyard with an outdoor shower to rinse off the sand. The average stay on Denis is nine nights, although one emotional entry in the visitors' book recorded a four-month stay. Right up until the last possible minute, you can bury your toes in the warm sand on the beach or sip an ice-cold beer at the bar.

      "bodyText": "Evidence of a dramatic slowdown in the US economy helped boost the euro on the foreign exchanges yesterday as dealers contemplated the end of record American expansion. The US economy grew at annual rate of 2.7% in the third quarter, the slowest pace for more than a year and well below market expectations. In the second quarter the economy expanded by 5.6%. Europe's beleaguered single currency jumped half a cent on the news, which provoked fears of a sharp end to the US economy's nine-year boom. The euro finished trading in London at 84.1 cents against the dollar, up from 83.3 earlier, and its highest level for a week. \"The GDP figures played on the fears of a hard-landing scenario in the US,\" Marc Chandler at Deutsche Bank said, adding that it was still too early for the Fed to ease monetary policy. Robust US growth has been blamed for the 30% fall in the euro since its launch in January 1999. Investors have rushed to buy dollar-denominated assets in the expectation of better returns in US markets than in Europe. Signs of a slowdown in the United States could prompt the end of the long dollar bull market, according to some analysts.

His peerage will be a constant reminder of the lack of probity which has always surrounded Tory party funding.\" Mr Ashcroft gave \u00a3766,000, almost exactly the same as last year, but turned a \u00a3250,000 loan into a gift - the remnant of a \u00a32m loan which had also been converted this way. His donations in kind were also about the same amount, bringing a virtually unchanged total. The formula is likely to have been used to reduce unwelcome headlines. The Tory chairman, Michael Ancram, struck a doggedly cheerful note. \"This has been a splendid year. While Tony Blair is increasingly out of touch with everyday concerns, the Conservative party has, in stark contrast, shown that it is listening to the country and tackling the issues that really matter.\"",

This week she is sliding down a python's back (so to speak). The papers today are full of pictures of her cat, Maurice, who had to be rescued by the RSPCA on Thursday night after neighbours heard piteous miaowing coming from Pandora's flat in Pimlico. Unfortunately, she was on a fact-finding mission with Keith Allen in Ayia Napa at the time of the cat's rescue. An RSPCA spokesperson said: \"Dr Pandora Braithwaite may be charged with the neglect and cruelty of an animal. Maurice had not been fed for five days and was in an emaciated condition.\" </p> <p> I phoned Pandora's mother, Tanya, for the inside story and she told me that Maurice's computerised feed-a-pet feeding bowl had developed a fault and had refused to open up and feed the ravenous beast. Some of the headlines were harsh: \"Pan's pet starved alone\", \"Drug MP's cat horror\", and \"Pan's pussy shock\". </p> <p> In my role (unpaid) as Pandora's advisor on Middle England, I rang the House of Commons to offer my help.

      "bodyText": "Saturday, October 21, Ashby-de-la-Zouch Last week Pandora was climbing the rungs of the snakes and ladders of life. This week she is sliding down a python's back (so to speak). The papers today are full of pictures of her cat, Maurice, who had to be rescued by the RSPCA on Thursday night after neighbours heard piteous miaowing coming from Pandora's flat in Pimlico. Unfortunately, she was on a fact-finding mission with Keith Allen in Ayia Napa at the time of the cat's rescue. An RSPCA spokesperson said: \"Dr Pandora Braithwaite may be charged with the neglect and cruelty of an animal. Maurice had not been fed for five days and was in an emaciated condition.\" I phoned Pandora's mother, Tanya, for the inside story and she told me that Maurice's computerised feed-a-pet feeding bowl had developed a fault and had refused to open up and feed the ravenous beast. Some of the headlines were harsh: \"Pan's pet starved alone\", \"Drug MP's cat horror\", and \"Pan's pussy shock\". In my role (unpaid) as Pandora's advisor on Middle England, I rang the House of Commons to offer my help. Unfortunately, she was not able to take my call as she was in emergency talks with Alastair Campbell. I left a message with her private secretary, Nigel Hetherington, \"Tell her to make a large donation to the Cat Rescue Mission.\" Nigel said: \"How very, very original.

The New York courts found in favour of Grove Press, and an appeal brought by the federal government affirmed the decision.

A suit bought against Miller, and a conspiracy charge against Grove Press and publisher Barney Rossett, was dropped before it got to court.</p> <p>In 1965, Putnam's public- ation of John Cleland's Memoirs Of A Woman Of Pleasure, better known as Fanny Hill, saw Rembar defending the book all the way to the US supreme court. With the overturning of a temporary restraint against the book in New York, sales rocketed, but Rembar found himself on more uncertain ground when he tried to argue the literary merit of the book and its author's intent in writing it.</p> <p>On publication, in the mid-18th century, Cleland, broke and facing debtor's prison, had written the novel and sold it outright for \u00a320, which made any attempted defence that he had crafted the novel with serious literary intentions patently absurd. The eventual decision of the supreme court was six to three in the publisher's favour.</p> <p>Rembar's book on these cases, optimistically titled The End Of Obscenity (1968), was a mixture of court testimony, history and sharp, sometimes amusing, asides into the history of American law. It won the George Polk Memorial Award for the best book of 1968.

      "body": "<p>Geisha: girl power. Not a high-class prostitute, but a liberated woman. \"Geisha never cook\", was one of the more intriguing pieces of information I heard when I went to live in the geisha quarter of Kyoto. But I did not realise quite how far their refusal to set foot inside a kitchen extended until I made my first visit to a geisha house. (Geisha - meaning \"arts people\" or \"entertainers\" - live in an okiya. They carry out their nightly work, entertaining at banquets, in an ochaya, or teahouse.) </p> <p>Haruta-san, the proprietress or \"mother\" of the house, was a big-hearted, straight-talking woman of 50 - utterly different from the simpering geisha of the western stereotype. She welcomed me in and offered me coffee, then settled down for a chat. I was still wondering when she was going to put the kettle on when the doorbell rang and a young man arrived from a nearby cafe, bearing two cups of steaming coffee on a tray. </p> <p>The Kyoto geisha districts - of which the most famous is Gion - fulfil one's every fantasy of the mystery and enchantment of the geisha world. They are medieval thoroughfares, picturesque rabbit warrens of tiny alleys, too narrow for cars to pass through, lined with wooden geisha houses and teahouses. At dusk white lanterns begin to glow outside the doors of the teahouses, indicating that they are open for business. That is the time when one might spot a maiko (\"dancing girl\", or trainee geisha) or a geisha, flitting along like an apparition from another age. </p> <p>The maiko are the most extraordinary. Their faces are painted eggshell white, their eyes lined in black, their mouths rosebuds of red. As they pass by, you notice that their ornate kimonos, primly wrapped at the front, are pulled down shockingly low at the rear to reveal a white-painted expanse of back. At the nape of the neck, the part of the body which Japanese men find most sexy, is a tantalising fork of bare skin, the shape of a serpent\"s tongue, left unpainted. </p> <p>Their world is enveloped in secrecy. Most Japanese have never seen a geisha and even fewer have ever managed to meet one. They are the confidantes of some of the country's most powerful politicos and businessmen, who need to be sure that whatever is said or done at a teahouse party remains strictly confidential. Added to which, an evening at a teahouse is liable to run to several thousand pounds. Even those who have the connections and budget to afford such entertainment still see only the geishas' public faces. </p> <p>But I wanted to meet the real women behind the painted smile, to find out who they were and how they perceived their lives and their work. I had some advantages: I was not male, like their customers; and I was single and had experienced life in Japan as a single woman. I also had some idea of how to behave in the proper Japanese way - not pushy but restrained, quiet and eternally polite. </p> <p>Eventually it all paid off. As we sat over our coffees in the kitchen of her geisha house, Haruta-san told me her story. She was born on the impoverished island of Kyushu to a wealthy landowner and a geisha. Her mother disappeared after her birth, and her father took her in. Tormented by his legitimate children, she ran away at 10 to find her mother, by then married and living in Osaka. But the mother was far from pleased. She beat her, bullied her, refused to let her go to school, then sold her to a hospital to work rinsing out filthy rags. </p> <p>At the age of 12 Haruta tried to commit suicide. By 14, barely literate, she was working in a \"cabaret\" (a euphemism for a brothel) in Osaka. There she met a woman who suggested that she become a geisha. As a geisha, she was told, she would be provided for throughout her life. </p> <p>The woman found a guarantor to give her an introduction to a geisha house. There she again found herself at the bottom of the heap. \"In winter they wouldn't let me take a bath,\" she said. \"I had to wash in freezing cold well-water. They wouldn't let me sit on tatami [woven straw] mats, they made me kneel on the hard wooden floor in the entrance hall. But I persevered. I put up with it all and eventually they realised they could trust me.\" </p> <p>Many years and several lovers later, she inherited the keys to the house. When I met her she was a prosperous businesswoman, providing for and training two maiko and a geisha who lived with her. </p> <p>The geisha world was Haruta's salvation. For many women of her generation, the geisha world offered a way of surviving and even, with luck, financial indepen dence. Modern-day geisha no longer have bad-luck stories. These days no one turns to the profession out of desperation, neither is anyone sold by their parents. But many young girls still wish to wear the white face and an ornate kimono as the embodiment of traditional femininity. </p> <p>Harumi, one of the maiko to whom Haruta was \"mother\", was the epitome of geisha prettiness. She grew up in a village just outside Kyoto. Her father was a builder, her mother a taxi driver. \"I wanted to be a geisha ever since I was a little girl,\" she told me. Like modelling, becoming a geisha is a career where beauty is all; class and qualifications count for nothing. At 13, Harumi left home and regular schooling to move into Haruta's house. When I met her she was 15, brimming with confidence, used to mixing with and being admired by business magnates, politicians, actors and rock stars; people who she could otherwise never have dreamed of meeting. </p> <p>In the 17th century, long before the word geisha was coined, their precursors were performing on stages in the dry bed of the river Kamo in Kyoto. The most original of all, a woman named Izumo no Okuni, electrified her public by cross-dressing. She performed erotic dances and saucy sketches wearing brocade trousers and an animal-skin jacket like a dashing young man about town. She even dressed as a priest. People called her performance \"kabuku\", meaning \"to be wild and outrageous\". </p> <p>This was the beginning of the kabuki theatre. In those days, the line between acting and prostitution was very thin. Soon there were troupes of courtesans performing risqu\u00e9 dances across the country and providing other services after the show. The shogunate, the government of the day, was less worried about morality than about threats to public order, and only banned actresses from the public stage in 1647, after squabbles between samurai over particularly desirable women. </p> <p>Women's kabuki was replaced by young men's kabuki; but the problem remained the same, with beautiful young actors offering sexual favours. Finally that too was banned and replaced by adult men's kabuki, as we have it today, in which men take the parts of women. </p> <p>In those days, according to the Confucian code, it was considered grossly immoral to marry someone you loved; marriage was arranged by your parents. It was also improper to enjoy sex with your wife. The function of marriage was to produce offspring and sex was expected to cease once that function had been fulfilled. </p> <p>The government, however, appreciated that men had needs; hence the provision of licensed pleasure quarters, which quickly turned into glamorous entertainment hubs offering far more than sex. There, men went to enjoy fine music, food, dancing and conversation. If they were lucky, the evening might culminate in sex; but the top courtesans had the right to refuse and would only agree to share their beds with the most charming and sophisticated suitors. </p> <p>The first people to go by the name of geisha appeared around the turn of the 17th century. Strangely enough, they were men. Their job was to entertain with bawdy conversation, song and dance. Around 1760, women began to join their ranks and quickly outnumbered the men. Soon the word \"geisha\" was used primarily of women. The courtesans, gorgeous though they might be, were caged birds, literally imprisoned within the walled pleasure quarters. Yet the geisha were free spirits; their skills at music and dancing gave them independence. They came and went as they pleased and relied on their arts, not their bodies, for their living. </p> <p> Although they have always had an ambivalent position on the edge of society, some geisha, like the hetairae of ancient Greece, are trained to be the companions of brilliant and powerful men. Many have been the lovers and sometimes the wives of prime ministers. Often wealthy men, forced by their fathers into an unhappy first marriage with a \"suitable\" woman, get a divorce as soon as they become powerful in their own right and are then free to marry the woman of their choice, who may be a geisha whom they have met at a teahouse party. Ex-geisha, of course, make the most charming society hostesses. </p> <p>Many geisha are supported by a \"danna\" or patron, often elderly men who can afford to support them as well as their wife and children. But having a patron does not impinge on independence. As one long-time (male) foreign resident of Japan put it, \"They are like cats, dignified and totally independent.\" Until the second world war, every geisha assumed that she would have a danna, who would provide her with a house, pay for her kimonos and dance classes and give her a regular allowance. </p> <p>Like modern western women, the geisha's career is the centre of her life. In the daytime she hones her classical dancing and music skills which are her chief arts, and which she continues to study throughout her life. In the evening she appears at teahouse parties, providing witty conversation, a ready ear and entertaining the customers with her exquisite singing and dancing. Whether any more goes on is up to each individual but it is not part of the job. </p> <p>And, of course, the geisha never emerges before 11am. Then you can spot her in the street, pale and bleary-eyed after the night's partying, perhaps with her hair still unbrushed or in her nightwear, on her way to the local coffee shop for eggs and toast. </p> <p>\u0095 Geisha by Lesley Downer is published in hardback on Thursday, priced \u00a318.99, by Headline Book Publishing Ltd.

Not a high-class prostitute, but a liberated woman. \"Geisha never cook\", was one of the more intriguing pieces of information I heard when I went to live in the geisha quarter of Kyoto. But I did not realise quite how far their refusal to set foot inside a kitchen extended until I made my first visit to a geisha house. (Geisha - meaning \"arts people\" or \"entertainers\" - live in an okiya. They carry out their nightly work, entertaining at banquets, in an ochaya, or teahouse.) Haruta-san, the proprietress or \"mother\" of the house, was a big-hearted, straight-talking woman of 50 - utterly different from the simpering geisha of the western stereotype. She welcomed me in and offered me coffee, then settled down for a chat. I was still wondering when she was going to put the kettle on when the doorbell rang and a young man arrived from a nearby cafe, bearing two cups of steaming coffee on a tray. The Kyoto geisha districts - of which the most famous is Gion - fulfil one's every fantasy of the mystery and enchantment of the geisha world. They are medieval thoroughfares, picturesque rabbit warrens of tiny alleys, too narrow for cars to pass through, lined with wooden geisha houses and teahouses. At dusk white lanterns begin to glow outside the doors of the teahouses, indicating that they are open for business. That is the time when one might spot a maiko (\"dancing girl\", or trainee geisha) or a geisha, flitting along like an apparition from another age. The maiko are the most extraordinary. Their faces are painted eggshell white, their eyes lined in black, their mouths rosebuds of red. As they pass by, you notice that their ornate kimonos, primly wrapped at the front, are pulled down shockingly low at the rear to reveal a white-painted expanse of back. At the nape of the neck, the part of the body which Japanese men find most sexy, is a tantalising fork of bare skin, the shape of a serpent\"s tongue, left unpainted.

      "body": "<p>Six months before leaving the National Theatre I was asked to write and present a series of programmes about the history of 20th-century theatre for BBC2. This is an account of the filming. The actual start was several months earlier, when I interviewed John Gielgud, in case he \"dropped off the twig\", as he put it. </p> <p><strong> September 13 1999</strong> </p> <p>To the Aran Islands, to film a sequence about Synge, who went there in 1898 for four summers, out of which came three great plays. We arrive from Stansted at Knock airport in Galway - a monument to the capitalist instincts of the Catholic church - and drive to an airstrip in Connemara, through Knock and Tuam and Galway City. The west of Ireland has an air of yesterday: no factory farming, not much speculative building, the shop fronts all gloss paint and Celtic lettering, none of the graphics and logos of the New Europe. </p> <p>The airstrip is a thin tear of tarmac in a field. The plane seats six. We skim the sea and within minutes see the small island of Inishmaan before us, like a giant sleeping seal, scarred with hundreds of drystone walls, containing pockets of scrubby grass, and houses dotted over the island like a ragged white necklace. We land on one of the few large, unenclosed fields, next to a Gaelic football ground with, surrealistically, only one set of goalposts. We go out on a recce round the island and watch the sun go down through huge waves, standing on a cliff at the west tip of the island - nothing between us and America. </p> <p><strong> September 14</strong> </p> <p>Dawn. Standing on a grey, sandy beach, we film the sun rising over the hills of County Clare. It's very mild, a clear sky, butter-gold sun, a perfect morning. It doesn't seem to fit with what I've written about Synge coming to a bleak, weather-beaten place. </p> <p>It's too sunny to film on the rocky outcrop where we stood last night, so we go off to another location, where huge slabs of limestone pave the fields like abandoned car parks, and massive chunks stand up, sliced by the weather into great grey lumps with six-inch crevasses. This is the spot for my first \"PTC\" - I'm learning: PTC, piece to camera. I have to walk along the edge of a limestone cliff, stepping over the crevasses, talking to the distant camera, following a route that I'm assured looks great on camera but demands that I stop on the words \"edge of the world\" at the edge of a 50ft drop. Ah yes, no trouble. It's hard enough to remember what I've written, but walk, talk, don't fall off and look at the camera? Now I really admire Anneka Rice. </p> <p>The sun is hot. We move around the island to other locations. To someone used to filming drama accompanied by actors, extras, a crew of 30 odd and an army of vehicles, driving around in a old Land Rover with a crew of three seems deeply enviable. </p> <p>The weather changes: the cliff that we recced last night is thought to be suitably stormy. This time I have to walk towards the camera while stepping over large sharp rocks, skirting craggy pools, trying not to slip on sea-weed, pointing to America, then to England, and talking to an unresponsive lens about the way British drama has been dependent on the Irish for centuries. When I reach the camera without messing up my words or slipping into the sea, there is jubilation from the crew. \"The waves behind you!\" they shriek. \"We thought you were going to be dragged into the sea!\" And there I was worrying about my lines. </p> <p><strong> September 15</strong> </p> <p>The cottage where Synge stayed: it's small, low and long. Perhaps a dozen people lived here in four small rooms, one of those being occupied by the paying guest. The cottage has been restored by the great-granddaughter of Synge's hosts: a labour of love, she's raised the money to restore the cottage, dilapidated since her parents moved to a new cottage just below in 1978. It has a new earth floor in the kitchen, floorboards next door in Synge's room, a new rye-thatched roof. </p> <p>Synge was sent here by his producer, Yeats, who did something that producers often do, but it seldom works: he told Synge what to write about. \"Give up Paris,\" he said. \"Go to the Aran Islands. Live as if you were one of the people themselves; express a life that has never found expression.\" Yeats and Lady Gregory had been here; she was remembered for her snobbery, for refusing to give sweets to the kids, and for bribing neighbours to keep their dog quiet when she stayed in the cottage. Synge wrote listening to the comforting chatter of the women in the kitchen speaking Irish, which he learned from a Martin McDonagh - almost certainly a distant cousin of the prolific young author of The Cripple of Inishmaan (who lives in Elephant and Castle). The islanders still speak Irish among themselves. </p> <p>Life on the island is still hard and poor. There are photos of 19th-century evictions in the house: they had to pay a ground rent to an English landlord, only a few shillings, but imagine evicting people who had to make a living from this unforgiving soil. </p> <p>In the evening we film in the bar; we've brought some musicians over from Galway. It starts to fill up around 10 o'clock. Only one man complains of being \"exploited\" by the BBC. He's an immigrant - a Dubliner - and he's told by an islander not to be so inhospitable. Mostly they seem indifferent to our filming. After all, they're used to film crews here; they had Flaherty doing Man of Aran in 1934. Rivers of Guinness flow, every table with black columns of creamy Guinness lined up like skittles. After we stop filming, people start to sing - unaccompanied, unselfconscious Irish songs, the strange intervals made stranger by the loose relation with pitch, straying around the note like the wind through trees. </p> <p><strong> September 16</strong> </p> <p>We fly back to Connemara. At the tiny airport shop (which sells home-made scones) I buy another copy of Synge's journal, The Aran Islands. \"He was through here today, you know,\" says the man behind the counter. \"You could have got him to sign your book.\" </p> <p>\u0095 This is the first of our weekly edited extracts from the diary that Richard Eyre kept while filming Changing Stages. The first part is on BBC2 at 6pm on Sunday 5 November. The book of the series is published next week by Bloomsbury, price \u00a330.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Malaria</strong> <br> Susan Hillmore <br> 134pp, Jonathan Cape<br> \u00a310 <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502448344,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a><br></p> <p> Mannar, the anonymous fabulist narrator of Susan Hillmore's compact, elliptical novel tells us, was once regarded as a latter-day Garden of Eden, an earthly paradise in which \"sparkling streams cascaded down hillsides and meandered through green valleys. Elephants browsed with deer and roamed in peace. Cranes and pink-headed duck reflected their plumage in water tanks built by kings on the fringes of ancient cities.\" No longer. Now, we are told, rivers stagnate, oily coral lies blasted and flora and fauna have reached or already passed the brink of extinction. </p> <p>Although Mannar's postlapsarian state is fleetingly ascribed to the forgetfulness of the gods, there is little doubt as to the true culprits. Presided over by corrupt politicians and ransacked by the reckless activity of its people, who are desperate to exploit its natural abundance, the island has been turned from heaven into hell by human beings. Into this debased perfection steps Sir Alexander Haye, a zoologist wreathed in TV celebrity, bent on capturing Mannar's last surviving herd of elephants on film - not, we understand, in the spirit of a conservationist plea, but as a panacea to concerned western viewers as well as a gambit, with the ruling elite's connivance, to boost the island's failing tourist industry. </p> <p>The PR stunt that ushers in this dubious project is the gift of a baby elephant to London Zoo, to be escorted from the remote, inaccessible hills to the airport by Alexander's twin brother Max, who himself lives in reclusive opulence on one of Mannar's rocky outcrops. The central strand of the novel concerns Max's hellish, allegorical journey upcountry, during which a stealthy mosquito infects him with the malaria of the title. Distressed at his own complicity in this act of bad faith - as the baby elephant is whisked away in an aeroplane, its enraged mother runs pell-mell through hangar and over runway - Max succumbs to the disease, and when he returns to his shuttered castle, he is plunged into a hallucinatory fever that mirrors Mannar's plight. </p> <p>This section of intensely imagined, dense descriptive writing is perhaps the strongest part of a novel that evokes the miserable reality of ecological destruction and its concomitant political and social malaise without exploring it in any great depth. Hillmore is adept, however, at translating her subject into powerful, lyrical prose, most notably when she is portraying Max's delirium: \"Outside the sea had boiled itself away and over the grey salty landscape a terrifying sun burned in the sky. On cracked dusty earth lay desiccated fish whose flesh was being stripped from their bones by scavenging seabirds.\" As his fever subsides, Max is visited by a vision of mermaids drowning in the poisoned sea, their agonising death throes later echoed by the popular revolt that sweeps the island, leaving in its wake massacred orphans and rotting piles of charred corpses. </p> <p>If Alexander's philanthropic posturings strike a false note - the possibilities for his film are increased five-fold when the elephants he plans to portray are discovered splayed out in a mass grave - then Max's disengaged horror is equally useless. Indeed, there is little cause for optimism in Malaria, where entropy and brutality have combined to snuff out the future. Not developed fully enough to serve as cautionary tale, Hillmore's bravura depiction of this unrelenting nightmare is, however, a striking and compelling reflection of the world as it may yet become.</p>",

Although Mannar's postlapsarian state is fleetingly ascribed to the forgetfulness of the gods, there is little doubt as to the true culprits. Presided over by corrupt politicians and ransacked by the reckless activity of its people, who are desperate to exploit its natural abundance, the island has been turned from heaven into hell by human beings. Into this debased perfection steps Sir Alexander Haye, a zoologist wreathed in TV celebrity, bent on capturing Mannar's last surviving herd of elephants on film - not, we understand, in the spirit of a conservationist plea, but as a panacea to concerned western viewers as well as a gambit, with the ruling elite's connivance, to boost the island's failing tourist industry. The PR stunt that ushers in this dubious project is the gift of a baby elephant to London Zoo, to be escorted from the remote, inaccessible hills to the airport by Alexander's twin brother Max, who himself lives in reclusive opulence on one of Mannar's rocky outcrops. The central strand of the novel concerns Max's hellish, allegorical journey upcountry, during which a stealthy mosquito infects him with the malaria of the title. Distressed at his own complicity in this act of bad faith - as the baby elephant is whisked away in an aeroplane, its enraged mother runs pell-mell through hangar and over runway - Max succumbs to the disease, and when he returns to his shuttered castle, he is plunged into a hallucinatory fever that mirrors Mannar's plight. This section of intensely imagined, dense descriptive writing is perhaps the strongest part of a novel that evokes the miserable reality of ecological destruction and its concomitant political and social malaise without exploring it in any great depth. Hillmore is adept, however, at translating her subject into powerful, lyrical prose, most notably when she is portraying Max's delirium: \"Outside the sea had boiled itself away and over the grey salty landscape a terrifying sun burned in the sky. On cracked dusty earth lay desiccated fish whose flesh was being stripped from their bones by scavenging seabirds.\" As his fever subsides, Max is visited by a vision of mermaids drowning in the poisoned sea, their agonising death throes later echoed by the popular revolt that sweeps the island, leaving in its wake massacred orphans and rotting piles of charred corpses. If Alexander's philanthropic posturings strike a false note - the possibilities for his film are increased five-fold when the elephants he plans to portray are discovered splayed out in a mass grave - then Max's disengaged horror is equally useless. Indeed, there is little cause for optimism in Malaria, where entropy and brutality have combined to snuff out the future. Not developed fully enough to serve as cautionary tale, Hillmore's bravura depiction of this unrelenting nightmare is, however, a striking and compelling reflection of the world as it may yet become.",

The pity will not be for the Nobel Prize-winning philosopher but for his suffering biographer, who found himself in the ghastly situation of being offered lots of money to write about a man whom - as he already knew when he banked the cheque - he loathed. The cheque was big because of his successful biography of Wittgenstein, whom by contrast he worships; the choice was forced on him by the fact that Russell was the only obvious place to go once his Wittgenstein book was done. </p> <p>Monk has taken the sole course open to anyone who finds himself in this plight. His bulky life of Russell is a sustained attack, in which he lays two charges against the philosopher, trying to make each as serious as he can. The first is that Russell made a living as a journalist, a crime in Monk's view because journalism is necessarily more popular and accessible than Russell's masterpiece, Principia Mathematica. He works himself into a lather of rage and contempt over Russell's addressing himself to the general public in terms it can understand, describing as \"superficial\", \"trivial\", \"naive\", \"dishonest\" and worse the newspaper articles and popular books by which for several decades Russell supported his family. </p> <p>His second charge is that the thrice-divorced Russell was emotionally stunted to the point of being a monster of coldness and indifference who hurt his wives, children and grandchildren profoundly. In particular Monk blames him for the mental breakdown of his son John, and even for the unhappiness of John's daughters. But by a quirk of the biographer's art, Monk provides all the materials for a refutation of his own view of Russell, who emerges from the mugging Monk attempts with his famous halo of white hair sticking up rather more than usual, but looking as quizzical and stoical as ever. </p> <p>The first charge would scarcely be worth rebutting if Russell's endless labours for peace - and for the improvement of humanity, which he saw as a necessary condition for attaining it - had not filled so much of his life after 1918. In common with others, including Karl Popper and Wittgenstein, he thought that the only hope of fashioning a new world was better education. He founded a school, which he had to finance by writing journalism and giving exhausting lecture tours in America. Wittgenstein did not survive long as a teacher, being hounded from the profession by irate parents of children he bullied, but Russell and his second wife Dora ran their school until the early 1930s. Russell's involvement ended only with his divorce from Dora, who by then had given birth to two children by another man. In addition to disdaining the books Russell wrote to pay for the school, Monk mocks his efforts to use what were then the latest psychological theories to teach his children and other pupils, and ignores his struggles to keep his marriage going for his children's sake, blaming him for the unhappiness they felt when it ended. </p> <p>This calumniating style prevails throughout. Monk's method is to gather vignettes of Russell from the writings of contemporaries who disliked him, so that we see him as vain, unfeeling and glib, cracking his acid witticisms at dinner parties and discoursing on the state of the world while neglecting his own offspring. Like Monk himself, the unimpeachably earnest Beatrice Webb thought that Russell was wasting his great powers by writing popular literature, although she did not explain how Russell was to have earned a living from logical treatises. </p> <p>When he was a young man Russell gave his inheritance away to the budding London School of Economics, founded by the Webbs, so Webb's attitude is hardly fair. But Monk relishes her attitude and makes it his own. Russell can do no right in his eyes; he scours Russell's journalism and blames him when he detects a change of mind - and also when he finds him saying the same thing. He blames him for addressing the general public when he should have been doing philosophy - and then berates him for returning to philosophy in the 1930s and 1940s, on the grounds that he had been away from it too long. There are too many such contradictions in Monk's endless complaints to detail. One thing he seems unable to recognise - or when he does, to abide - is Russell's irony and his witty use of contradiction and startling generalisation to make swift, thought-provoking points. Monk treats Russell's sallies with humourless seriousness, trying to get us to see them as proof of intellectual irresponsibility. </p> <p>In the decades after 1945, as the threat of nuclear disaster increased, Russell bombarded world leaders with telegrams urging peace and disarmament. Monk describes this as Russell's fantasy that he had a world role. Since Krushchev, Kennedy, Nkrumah, Nehru, Chou En Lai and others replied, and even sometimes negotiated with each other by means of their letters to him, it is hard to see how Russell could have avoided thinking so. </p> <p>Monk reserves most of his ire for what he sees as Russell's disastrous effect on his family, and it is here he does him deepest injustice. He tells us that Russell gave a home and an education to his children and grandchildren, fought to save his marriages for their sakes, suffered tremendously from the destructive behaviour of his second and third wives, loved his children profoundly and was devastated when his son John became schizophrenic - and yet, according to Monk, was still to blame for all that went wrong with them. In a way exactly reminiscent of his Nelson's-eye attitude to Wittgenstein's unpleasant character, Monk reports but passes no judgment on the amazing antics of Russell's wives and the dreadful harm done by John and his equally unstable wife to their children. He also reports, but does not comment upon, the enduring love for Russell of his daughter Kate and her children, his first wife Alys and both his second and third wives, facts that scarcely suggest the monster of Monk's imagination. The result is a badly skewed portrait. </p> <p>To readers who remember Russell's last years it will come as no surprise to have it confirmed that his apparent nonagenarian metamorphosis into a revolutionary follower of Che Guevera was the result of his name being misused by his egregious \"secretary\" Ralph Schoenman, an intemperate supporter of fiery causes. Russell was bitterly opposed to the Vietnam war, but the crude propaganda about it that Schoenman had him sign was certainly not his. Monk is vague about the degree to which Russell knew what Schoenman was doing (not much, the evidence suggests). This is an unpleasantly biased book, yet it still displays Monk's great talent as a writer and a biographer; let us hope he finds a more congenial subject next time.</p>",

His new short-story retrospective, The Angel on the Roof, sinks especially deep into the ice-bound aloneness of small towns and trailer parks in upstate New Hampshire and New York, the American North Country he's staked as his own. We see the inhabitants of one lakeside terminus from a dozen angles, each enriching the pride, idiocy, selfishness, sympathy, nobility and wreckage-clinging survived despair to be found in such lost corners. </p> <p>In the novel Continental Drift (1985), the careening effort by Bob Dubois to escape his caged small-town prospects tears him away from himself and his family, and leads to devastating loss. In Rule of the Bone (1995), a teenage boy's need to out-race alienation and parental abuse spins him off America's edge. The busload of drowned, frozen schoolchildren in The Sweet Hereafter (1997) and the middle-aged man doomed by his drunk, violent father's example in Affliction (1989) - both recently adapted as Oscar-winning films - show abandonment from other angles, a genetic flaw in America's heart. Banks knows this whole story. Born in New Hampshire, he's fought off his own violent father's example, freed himself from a fated life with fiction. He knows his subjects aren't a Jerry Springer freak show. They're humanity. </p> <p>\"There's an important tradition in American writing,\" the 60-year-old says, in the upstate New York small town where he now lives, when not teaching at Princeton, \"going back to Mark Twain and forward to Raymond Carver and Grace Paley, whose work is generated by love of people who are scorned and derided. The people I'm writing about are the ones you normally don't feel affection for when you see them in the street or the shopping mall. I have an almost simple-minded affection for them. My readers are not the same as my characters, as I'm very aware. So I'm glad when they feel that affection too.\" </p> <p>Vann, in the story \"Plains of Abraham\", stands for almost all Banks's male characters: \"a complex, layered mind with only a few compartments connected\". Alienated from his culture and class, unable to understand his own nature, he has no way out. \"I think that's particularly true of men,\" Banks says. \"They feel their lives are being mysteriously controlled by forces they can't even name. As a defence they compartmentalise their experience into little boxes that don't communicate, because the truth is too painful. At some point, they hear rapping through the walls of those boxes, and they start to realise something's deeply wrong. Most of my male characters then struggle back to some place in their past, to find when the light at tunnel's end dimmed.\" </p> <p>Banks's life was like that of his own future characters until his mid-twenties, fitted to the shape set for him: wife at 18 (first of four), baby at 19, divorced at 20, a small-town New Hampshire pipe-fitter in a pick-up truck. It was writing's discipline - Jack Kerouac's harsh background and the paternal friendship of Nelson Algren were among his inspirations - that plucked him to a different life. But this uprooting left guilty scars on work that was at first constrained, in denial. \"I felt I'd betrayed my past and the people who made it up. My writing was in a netherland: fearful of my own sources, of myself, till my mid-thirties, when I accepted them.\" </p> <p>The source that was most difficult to admit was his father, a violent drunk who abandoned the family when Banks was 12, and around whom he was physically anxious even in the man's old age. \"He remains the centre of my imaginative life. He wasn't just a violent, alcoholic brute, no one is. He died in 1979, and yet he appears in my dreams two or three times a week, as he was in his mid-forties, when he was at his most powerful. He left a residue of violence my neurons are still patterned around. It's trauma that rewires them, usually. Goodness never provides a trauma. Violence does. Abandonment does. Betrayal does. My adult life has been lucky, people have been faithful and loving. So my wiring's the same.\" </p> <p>\"The Visit\", in which a successful middle-aged man revisits a childhood home electrified with shadowy, threatening memories, is also Banks's attempt to invoke what he calls the \"heat and light\" of violence, \"its erotic charge, its intensity of attention\", for both victim and victimiser - a seduction that he later sought out in senseless bar-room fights which would have left him dead if writing hadn't stepped in. Affliction's paternal tragedy was his fictional goodbye to all that. \"I was glad I wrote that story. It meant I wouldn't have to again.\" </p> <p> The Sweet Hereafter and Rule of the Bone instead focused on 1990s children: Nicole in one, Bone in the other, both sexually abused. The former's schoolbus, in which a town's children sink inexorably away from their parents through cracked ice, is later a refuge from parents for Bone, abandonment unbroken. Recently, Cloudsplitter (1999), about violent Abolitionist John Brown, investigated racism's stain. </p> <p>Banks, meanwhile, is back where he started, in a working-class small town. \"I had to will myself back.

He and his kind represent what might be called genetic physicists: people who look for the deep theoretical underpinnings behind the immediately visible quirks of nature. In fact, this book is an attempt to explain everything living that we can see without a microscope, so it's not lacking in ambition. The title alludes to Maxwell's Demon, an imaginary being devised by James Clerk Maxwell who distorts the normal processes of thermodynamics to make a lawful but very unlikely order; Ridley's version names the processes that maintain complex information in DNA against the efforts of time and chance to garble or degrade it. </p> <p>The central question he considers is why there should be anything on earth more complex than bacteria; bacteria do very well, thank you. According to some calculations, they constitute the majority of living things on earth; they had the place to themselves for about 1.5 billion years before the first more complex cells appeared, and according to Ridley it was nearly another 1.5 billion years of more or less exciting amoebae before the first animals appeared. What took us so long? </p> <p>The answer he derives sweeps over these billions of years, but comes simply enough from two founding principles of selfish-gene theory: that life is essentially a process of copying information contained in strings of chemicals - usually DNA - and that the competition to be copied between different strings of DNA, or genes, is unceasing and pursued with the utmost ingenuity. This language of agency is very difficult to avoid, although Ridley is scrupulously careful not to anthropomorphise his genes. Some people have argued that the evolution of complexity is in some sense inevitable in a Darwinian world, if only because all the simple niches in it fill up fairly soon. Certainly, Ridley believes that there will almost always be an advantage available for a creature more complex - by which he means having more genes - than any predecessor. So this makes the time it took to develop creatures capable of exploiting smaller ones all the more puzzling. </p> <p>The difficulty, as he sees it, is not that such creatures might evolve in the first place; mutations are common enough that some helpful ones are bound to appear over millions of years simply because it's difficult for cells to copy very long strings of DNA accurately as they divide. However, this simplicity also makes it very difficult for creatures of interesting complexity to maintain themselves. In the first few chapters Ridley proves with elegant calculations that humans are evolutionarily impossible: we ought to disintegrate as a species in a welter of copying mistakes and degenerating mutations. </p> <p>The process has been observed in artificially pampered fruit flies; the worry, in one form or another, is as old as genetics. To paraphrase Goldsmith: ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey, where health accumulates and genes decay. This genetic fragility is why Ridley believes that human cloning is impossible on any large scale. Despite all this elegant theory, we're still here; and most of the book is taken up with a detailed and fascinating account of the ways in which sex and gender may have evolved so as to guarantee the stability of complex animals (this is not just a matter of ensuring that the DNA is copied accurately enough through the generations, and repaired where possible). Sex and gender are two different things, and in Ridley's account they serve two different purposes. </p> <p>Sex, or the exchange of genetic material, is known between bacteria: it allows the correction of copying mistakes. Gender, on the other hand, follows from the accident that plants and animals are made up of cells that are themselves more complex than bacterial cells. They have inner nuclei, in which most of the DNA is stored (unlike bacteria, who keep theirs slopping around anyhow). Gender results from the fact that when two such cells have sex, the DNA outside the nucleus of one is either stripped away or destroyed. From this simple asymmetry, cells have specialised to be either sperm or eggs and their bearers to be either male or female. This made possible the baroque multiplications and divisions that chromosomes undergo when sex cells are formed, and these in turn ensure that genes must cooperate with each other or fail to be copied. </p> <p>This isn't really a popular-science book. It is elegantly written, very informative and free of mathematics, but it suffers from its donnish virtues. Ridley writes like a good lecturer, and he makes the reader feel like a good undergraduate. But even if he is too scrupulous to succeed in a marketplace full of loud certainties, he carries off the traditional pop-science ending in fine style. This is the point at which the author suddenly expands his conclusions to take in the whole universe and the future of mankind; true to the form, Mendel's Demon ends with a very funny riff on the mating habits of angels. </p> <p> \u0095 Andrew Brown is the author of Darwin Wars (see <a href=\"http://www.darwinwars.com\">www.darwinwars.com</a>).</p>",

Clancy - a terrible old windbag - takes more than 1,000 pages to tell a story that should have taken half that; given his top-selling status, he has clearly progressed beyond any kind of editing. With its blockbuster cast, wodges of undigested research and useless insider information, endless acronyms and countless dreary minor anecdotes, the book is clunkily authentic and insistent on leaving nothing to the imagination. Clancy comes into his own as a techno-bore, but in spite of all the hardware authenticity - and plausibility of the central scenario - as an objective political analyst, he is in the world of Boys' Own. The general tone is one of old-fashioned colonial propaganda: devious Oriental control freaks versus the responsible statesmanship and reasoned informality of US government (the president calls his wife \"Babe\"; the head of the CIA calls her husband \"Honeybunny\"). Clancy's president is an anodyne Kennedy retread, minus infidelities, while the Russians - now that we know them better - turn out to be soulful, reliable and, well, not wily. \"He was a Russian patriot,\" we are solemnly informed in tourist-brochure prose, \"who loved the very smell of Russian soil, the birch forests, the vodka and the borscht.\" </p> <p>The writing - never any great shakes to start with and at best done in a style that could be called runaway word processor - is by now on full autopilot, and readers who haven't already quit from exhaustion might get the sneaking suspicion that the author too has long jumped ship. From here on few sentences stand up to inspection, particularly those relating to routine and time (most of the book): \"The morning sun that lit up Beijing had done the same to Siberia even earlier in the day.\" </p> <p> The Bear and the Dragon lends new evidence to the theory that Clancy is in reality a CIA committee designed to produce US propaganda in the form of popular entertainment. In its bulk and lack of conspicuous authorship, the work is clearly beyond the scope of a single writer, just as it is equally obvious that the jacket photo of \"Tom Clancy\" is in fact Big Ron Atkinson moonlighting as an author double. </p> <p>After Clancy, Andy McNab is a breeze: Blue Peter for big boys - \"Here's a bomb I made earlier\". McNab is on-the-ground, hands-on and presenter-led with a hero who can manage a bit of fieldcraft, is professionally efficient and privately a mess; prone to dodgy women and sentimental about children. Like Clancy, McNab is a secure franchise, an authentic storyteller on the grounds of his been-there, done-that experiences in the SAS, thanks to which he is able to dispose of the notion of writing as a poncy business. His language favours the vernacular, and any evidence of interior life is rendered only in terms of the accepted visceral response, as in \"gutted\". </p> <p>McNab's plots, which are efficient and uncomplicated, could be primly summarised as: the best-laid plans go awry, so get out of that. Yet, for all his reliance on formula, he never emerges as a cynical writer and with this novel shows signs of studying the craft. Firewall is essentially an update of Len Deighton's Billion Dollar Brain , down to its Scandinavian locations and computer plot - a debt belatedly admitted when McNab writes \"I felt like Harry Palmer in one of those Michael Caine films from the 60s\" - and it succeeds in capturing something of early Deighton's insolent, other-ranks tone.</p>",

Each story reveals lives cut open with the precision of a surgeon's scalpel, every scene is probed with the thrill of a torch through a keyhole.

It appeared in 1924, at the very time when Hugh MacDiarmid was writing the lyrics in \"synthetic Scots\" that were to bring Buchan's taste into question. But there's hardly a piece in the book that doesn't give pleasure; Buchan chose only what he liked, and it shows. Pleasure, in the sense of editorial predilection, stands at the opposite pole of representativeness in the work of anthologists, who can seem to be facing a choice between putting in what they like and putting in what other people have liked (and what their friends have written). This doesn't mean that The Northern Muse fails as a record of what lots of people have liked, but Buchan is unScottishly keen, as some might think, on pleasuring himself. </p> <p>Few of his choices are to be found in the New Penguin Book of Scottish Verse compiled by Robert Crawford and Mick Imlah, a selection more interested than Buchan's in inclusiveness. But this is a good book too: the poet editors are attentive to the verse of their contemporaries and to translations from Gaelic and Latin (excellent ones by Crawford himself, including a banishment \"knee-deep in shite\" to the croft and the plough, from the Latin of Shakespeare's contemporary Arthur Johnston). It has its \"finds\" and its serendipity, as in the case of gentle Allan Ramsay's little-known dying words or \"Last Advice\" of the granitic madam of an Edinburgh brothel. </p> <p>The 16th century yields a find in the vengeful Mrs MacGregor of Glenstrae, on a clanship matter, a Campbell crime: \"May sickness kill my father/ And Colin die of the plague.\" And 100 years on, there's Francis Sempill of Beltrees, whose Maggie Lauder is told by a passing piper: \"My name is Rob the Ranter:/ The lassies loup as they were daft,/ When I blaw up my chanter.\" Marion Bernstein of Victorian Paisley is soundly opposed to blood sports, and there's a welcome MacGonagall. </p> <p>The scarcity here of Buchan's selections testifies to the richness of the heritage and to a difference of opinion concerning the black hole which is often felt to have opened up in 19th-century Scottish literature, whose Kailyard school, with its vernacular and its rural settings, can be seen as a response to the subordination of Scots speech promoted by parliamentary union and urban and industrial development. MacDiarmid set himself to cut out the soft heart of the \"mawkish\" Kailyard, and the impact of his early poems drew Scotland towards modernist practice, where a dislike of Victorian sentimentality was routinely aired. </p> <p>Country life of the sort embodied in Burns's poems, write the New Penguin editors, \"shrank smartly into the margins as industry took root\". Smartly? MacDiarmid spent most of his life in the country, and his early poems are set there. Writers and others went on living there, and the version of pastoral that arose during these dark years and on into the new century produced valuable poems, several of them by upper-class women. The accomplished Violet Jacob, daughter of the 18th Laird of Dun, is rife in Buchan, but not in the New Penguin or in Douglas Dunn's successive anthologies of Scottish verse. </p> <p>Two of the most popular poems of the northern 19th century were James Hogg's \"Kilmeny\", in which a pure young girl goes to fairyland and experiences an overflight of Scotland and its history, and his friend William Laidlaw's \"Lucy's Flittin\". Extracts from \"Kilmeny\" are provided in the New Penguin. The Laidlaw, a Kailyard precursor dear to Buchan's project, is omitted. It is a fine poem, and an intensely sentimental one. Why does Servant Lucy leave everyone on the farm in tears? Two charged and equivocal lines may be the answer to that (\"ettled\" means meant, or ordained): \"If I wasna ettled to be ony better,/ Then what gars me wish ony better to be?\" Lucy may have been looking to improve herself. </p> <p>Hogg's many poems are thinly represented here. I turned to \"The Witch O' Fife\" hoping for the exhilarating night-rider ballad of that name done in the synthetic, antique Scots he devised for his ballads. What I found was a lyrical appendage to this ballad with a sprinkling of Scots words. The editors sometimes seem a little leery of Scots. Stevenson's lively vernacular poems, of interest to Buchan, are not among the 10 of his that are picked (double the tally for Dunbar, but well worth picking, admittedly). </p> <p>A selection by Douglas Dunn of 20th-century Scottish verse appeared towards the end of that century, in 1992. Here for the hip pocket is a digest of that anthology, 100 20th-Century Scottish Poems, with choices revised and a string of recent poems added. One recent poem by Donny O'Rourke, about a father who mends grandfather clocks, chimes with an earlier one by Angus Martin, who says \"I am a Scottish wood collector\" - two enjoyable occupational lyrics. Another appealing poem, Mick Imlah's \"Goldilocks\", is less straightforward. It is in both Dunns, but in the slim one stanzas absent from the parent anthology are restored or added. A galloping outdoors metre is applied to a state of inwardness, as the poet discovers a Scots-speaking tramp doppelg\u00e4nger in his Oxford college bed. In the Dunn book of 1992 are four poems by Alasdair Maclean, a Highland poet from Fife who is cross at times, and Larkin-like. In the digest there are none, and none in the New Penguin either. This is a loss. </p> <p>Another poet of that name is the Gael Sorley Maclean, whose symbolist elegy \"Hallaig\"- translated by himself from Gaelic into English - no anthologist of the period would be likely to leave out. It is one of the high points in Scottish literature of the last century, and a reminder of how complex, in one important respect, its achievements are: they are in more than one language and hail from more than one part of the world. All three of these anthologies acknowledge the existence of a Scottish diaspora and of a Scottish complexity. </p> <p>Among the flowering of Scottish prose and poetry that has taken place in the last few years can be identified, without presumption or piracy, an unforgettable work of the last few weeks - the novel No Great Mischief by a Canadian of Gaelic stock, Alistair MacLeod. It's about family feeling and clanship, it prefers a harsh maritime countryside to the city, and it shares some of the starkness of Mrs MacGregor of Glenstrae. MacLeod's rural world - with its rigours and dangers, its duties and skills - also has something of the world of Odysseus. The sun moves on \"its appointed journey\" through the sky. Here is a lordless, lairdless Nova Scotian Ithaca. It is both a Canadian book and a Scottish book; there are moments when Gaelic utterance makes it bilingual. When the narrator's twin sister turns up in Scotland, she is recognised as one of theirs; she belongs \"here\". The heart is Highland. </p> <p>Scots and English have been described as languages of the heart and the head respectively - categories mentioned in MacLeod's novel. It makes more sense to describe them as dialects of the same language. But it should also be said that this is a language of many dialects, both literary and demotic, and that in the work of many writers Scots and English are one.</p>",

      "body": "<p>For Roger Scruton, as for so many of his generation, the Paris riots of May 1968 were the defining political moment of his life. He was in the Latin Quarter when students tore up the cobblestones to hurl at the riot police. His friends overturned cars and uprooted lamp-posts to erect the barricades. Representatives of his own discipline, old philosophers like Marx and new ones like Foucault, were providing the intellectual fuel for the fire raging on the ground. </p> <p> As he watched the events unfold from his apartment window, and listened to his friends, drunk on revolutionary hope and excitement, Scruton found his own emotions and opinions crystallising. \"I suddenly realised that I was on the other side,\" he says. \"What I saw was an unruly mob of self-indulgent middle-class hooligans. When I asked my friends what they wanted, what were they trying to achieve, all I got back was this ludicrous Marxist gobbledegook. I was disgusted by it, and thought there must be a way back to the defence of western civilisation against these things. That's when I became a conservative. I knew I wanted to conserve things rather than pull them down.\" </p> <p> His efforts to do this over the next three decades have made him one of the most contentious figures in British public life. As an academic, journalist and writer he has been a lightning rod for criticism and abuse from the left. While he has a reputation as a first class professional philosopher among other academics of all political persuasions, he has regularly been shouted down in universities and prevented from speaking. </p> <p> His books have been unmercifully slaughtered by reviewers and his pronouncements on society mocked. He is accused of being a grammar-school boy in thrall to the upper classes: \"it is all a bit like Charles Ryder in Brideshead\", says one observer. The fact that he used to go fox-hunting wearing Enoch Powell's old hunting clothes - the jacket split the first time he used it - says it all for many others. \"I do ask myself why I make people so enraged, because I only ever say what I think. And while I know it might not be everyone's point of view, that doesn't seem particularly intolerable to me.\" </p> <p> Part of the reason is, of course, straightforward political disagreement. As an academic in the 1980s, for instance, he did not make himself popular among his peers by defending education cuts. But this doesn't explain the venomous intensity of the attacks. For this, one must look at his interventions in social and cultural issues, where gut reactions can count for more than the sophistication of the argument. One such issue is national identity, which has increasingly entered the cultural and intellectual mainstream. Britishness has become a legitimate subject for discussion with two recent debates - one trivial, one less so - flickering across the public consciousness; the Runnymede Trust report on the future of multi-ethnic Britain, and whether the England football team should have a foreign coach. </p> <p> It wasn't always this way. The incendiary combination of nationality, race, history and culture was until recently something most sensible commentators avoided. But not Scruton. In 1982, as editor of the conservative philosophical journal The Salisbury Review, he published an article called Education And Race by Ray Honeyford, a Bradford headmaster. The gist was that multi-cultural education was actually harmful for immigrant children. </p> <p> \"All hell broke loose,\" recalls Scruton. \"But Ray Honeyford is not racist. He spent his whole life teaching Pakistani children in Bradford, trying to do the best for them against their parents and the mullahs. He recognised the terrible conflicts. But then, in the 80s, any questioning of the left-liberal orthodoxy could only have a racist motivation, or be seen to give succour to racists. I'd argue that not addressing these issues gives succour to racists. But it got us into terrible trouble.\" </p> <p> His latest book, England: An Elegy tries to show England as reflected in its own ideals, he says. \"I know ideals aren't realities, but they do influence reality - social, legal, political, cultural.\" Its reception shows the change in mood. Of course he gets his share of sneering reviews but there is a recognition of his breadth of reference and scholarship and he wins less grudging support from some surprising quarters. </p> <p> Labour Peer Melvyn Bragg describes it as \"an elegant and moving book\", before claiming Scruton \"is excellent at bringing common sense to bear on the distressing frenzy which has overtaken those whose views of England can only be doom-struck and void of all praise.\" Anthony Barnett, the founding director of Charter 88, who also has written on Englishness from a radical perspective, has worked with Scruton. Together they set up the Town and Country Forum to bring a non-partisan approach to discussion of urban and rural conflicts. He praises Scruton's willingness to engage. </p> <p>\"People who take these things seriously are trying not to think in received political terms any more,\" Barnett says. \"Agri-business, medical ethics, environmental questions can't just be thought about in terms of right and left. Even on a red-flag issue like hunting there is no simple left position.\" Scruton himself, for instance, is in favour of higher fuel taxes although he is not surprised that their implementation was so contentious. </p> <p> But for all this apparent reasonableness, he still puts himself out there to be shot at. Shortly after he first became a father, two years ago, at 54, he wrote a tongue-in-cheek article about childrearing. \"It goes without saying that Sam will not enjoy his childhood\", he said before going on to anticipate their \"nightly readings of the classics and our home performances of Shakespeare,\" and the young Sam, like John Stuart Mill, would be reading Greek by the age of six. The Guardian Diary responded by launching the Samuel Scruton Playstation appeal, but he was duly castigated and mocked elsewhere for his antediluvianism. </p> <p> Again, this hasn't stopped him writing about his own experiences, and his last two books have contained significant autobiographical content. The opening lines of his historical and social celebration, On Hunting, said his life divides into three parts. \"In the first, I was wretched; in the second, ill at ease; in the third, hunting.\" In England: An Elegy, his starting point is himself. \"TS Eliot said writing autobiography was, 'imposing order on and eliciting order in, one's life'. It did bring order to my life which I needed.\" </p> <p> Scruton was born in 1944. His father was a left-wing working-class Mancunian who became a teacher. Jack Scruton hated the upper class and loved the English countryside. Scruton's mother, Beryl Claris - always called Johnny - was a more genteel figure who read romantic fiction and, \"entertained blue-rinsed ladies who appeared miraculously almost as soon as he [father] was out the door.\" </p> <p> Roger and his two sisters were brought up in Buckinghamshire, in Marlow and High Wycombe, and he remembers, \"a sort of Lawrentian class-tension between my parents. There were terrible rows which frightened the children. My father went through a very depressed period - partly through not getting anywhere with his career but also something deeper - about the time I was entering puberty. Life at home wasn't very good and I had really left by the time I was 16 and didn't go back until after Cambridge when I went to look after my mother when she was dying.\" </p> <p>In both On Hunting and England: An Elegy, Scruton continually nags at his father's viewpoint and arguments. \"My father was a man of principle,\" he says, \"who found his principles confirmed in the unremitting failure which they brought on him. But my personality was significantly shaped by him. He represented to me a personality that was quintessentially English in the determination to be himself and entertain his own cantankerous views. But he also represents a view of the world against which I found myself at an early age in rebellion.\" </p> <p> In fact Scruton was on the left at school, High Wycombe Grammar. But even then he didn't go along with \"all the fashionable causes of the day\", and was shocked when a friend was imprisoned after an Aldermaston march. Scruton has little but praise for the school, which the headmaster self-consciously modelled on Eton. Many of the staff had been in the war and in the colonial service; the children were clever and keen; but Scruton says he wasn't the brightest boy. \"There was one who could play all the Beethoven sonatas. When he was 14 he introduced me to Oswald Spengler's Decline Of The West. But many grammar schools were like that then. There was a ferment of intellectual activity as we explored the post-war world.\" </p> <p> For all this, he says he refused to fit in. He shunned the cadets and sports, played bass guitar when he was 16, and was into the Beatles. He was eventually expelled, although only after he had won a scholarship to Cambridge. \"The headmaster had wanted to throw me out for a while but he recognised that I was good for the statistics. We put on this play and he came and saw the stage on fire with a half-naked girl on it. His solution was to expel me.\" </p> <p> In his gap year - as it then wasn't called - Scruton washed-up in a Lyons corner house on the Mile End Road, east London, hitchhiked to Greece and then to Egypt before getting a boat to Lebanon, where he ran out of money. He couldn't work his passage home on British boats because he wasn't in the union - \"my first experience of the trade unions which my father admired\" - so ended up on a Norwegian vessel carrying potatoes. </p> <p> When he got to Cambridge, in 1962, his adventures made him feel much older than his contemporaries, and he changed courses on the first day, from natural sciences to philosophy. He says he was not political. \"But this was pre-1968. There was an old idea of education that prevailed. I went to lectures on Kant and Hume and logic and literature and I couldn't tell you what my lecturers' political beliefs were.\" </p> <p> In his new book he claims that England died about the time he was at university. From his father he got a pessimism about the fate of rural England and had a melancholy sense that western civilisation was doomed. \"But like anyone who was brought up on Leavis, I had a tremendous belief in English culture and literature. I never though there was an alternative to what we had inherited. You either learn to inherit it properly or you become disinherited. I always thought the oriental faction - the hashish-smoking people with pony tails and dreamy eyes - were escapists. They hadn't found an alternative but were just deceiving themselves.\" </p> <p> Although destined for an academic career, a life at Cambridge didn't appeal. \"It was then quasi-monastic. There weren't many women around, there was this mist of nostalgic pederasty that hung over it all.\" He had ambitions to be a writer but took a job at the University of Bordeaux where he rented a cottage in the foothills of the Pyrennees. He then moved to Rome, where he wrote a novel that was never published, and returned in 1969 to Peterhouse, Cambridge, as a research fellow in aesthetics. </p> <p> Two years later he moved to Birkbeck College, London. He was made professor of aesthetics in 1985 and stayed at the college until 1992. \"When I went to Birkbeck I was already in a conservative frame of mind,\" he says. \"My colleagues regarded me with great suspicion. The waves of 1968 had just reached London University. There were attempts to introduce more Foucault and Marx on to the curriculum. I had been brought up in Cambridge with this completely de-politicised view of what philosophy should be, so was obviously against all this.\" </p> <p> While at Birkbeck he read for the Bar as a fall-back position. \"I thought I might have to get out of this, and the law seemed a career where conservatives might be welcomed. I thought I ought to have an exit route.\" AC Grayling was a colleague in the Birkbeck philosophy department and says Scruton is a very good professional academic philosopher \"and a wonderful teacher of philosophy. The pedagogic works he wrote for students and the general public are clear, lucid and accurate. It is partly because of Roger's presence that the department is one of the best in the country.\" Grayling, who says he and Scruton disagree politically, also says what a \"very charming and somewhat sweet man,\" he is in person. \"This rather glum, obtuse figure who pops up every now again to say 'bring back hanging', or something, is not really characteristic of him.\" </p> <p> Ralph Walker of Magdalen College, Oxford, agrees about Scruton's academic stature, but claims that what he tries to do, at least part of the time, is to stimulate people. \"Some of the views he expresses in conversation or print are not necessarily views he would hold to the bitter end. They are often put in a provocative form for people to think about. Roger irritates people who find they don't like the position he's taken, but can't argue back. That can show itself as anger or accusations of extremism.\" </p> <p> This was Scruton's \"ill at ease\" period, made harder by a failed marriage. He had met Danielle Laffitte, a student, in France. After a long on-off affair they married in 1973, but were divorced in 1979. She still lives in England and they meet occasionally. \"It wasn't a very happy experience. I think marriages are much less stable if you live together first,\" he says. \"You don't have that sense of the metaphysical transformation from one condition to the next. The rite of passage is lost.\" </p> <p> He and Danielle didn't have children because there was, \"not sufficient commitment. Also there was selfishness. Perhaps if we had [children] we would have stayed together.\" Scruton did not become a father until two years ago when he and his second wife, Sophie Jeffreys, had Samuel. A second child, Lucy, was born last August. Jeffreys, an architectural historian, is 28 years his junior. They live contentedly on a farm in Wiltshire. Scruton also has a two-room apartment in Albany, the exclusive lodgings on London's Piccadilly. His rooms used to be the late MP Alan Clark's servant quarters.</p> <p> As Birkbeck only operated in the evenings, it gave Scruton time to pursue a career as a writer cum journalist as well as moving into the world of politics. He says he was appalled by the Heath government. \"There seemed to be a lot of thinking to be done and no-one was doing it.\" Along with the MP Hugh Fraser, Jonathan Aitken and academic John Casey, Scruton founded the Conservative Philosophy Group. Antonia Fraser, then married to Hugh Fraser, the Tory MP, and herself on the left, has been a friend since that time. Through her, Scruton got to know her present husband, Harold Pinter; this proved useful when Scruton was in financial difficulties. </p> <p> \"Wine has been the most important factor in my life, apart from women and song, but it can be an expensive taste. When I was a don at Cambridge I could buy it at cost and I bought a lot of 1961 clarets. But I fell on hard times and couldn't pay my tax bill so I sold the lot to Harold Pinter. He was the only person who would trust me that these bottles really were what I told him they were, because all the labels had come off. He was just marrying Antonia and wanted a proper cellar. He was very generous and did invite me to drink some of it afterwards.\" Scruton is often associated with Margaret Thatcher's reinvigoration of the Conservative party through a red-blooded commitment to the market in the mid 1970s. But he says that process happened quite independently of anything he was doing. \"Thatcher was completely indifferent to our kind of conservative philosophy. I'd never heard of her gurus - people like Alan Walters and Alfred Sherman.\" </p> <p> Scruton was associated with writers at the Spectator and Telegraph, exponents of a more settled, patrician conservatism. \"It was about a subdued sense of the importance of history and tradition, of doing things in an orderly way. Small-scale improvements. The market economy was a good thing but it wasn't the foundation of social order, and should be heavily qualified by all the traditions that enable people to live with each other rather than just compete. But under Thatcher it was completely the free market.\" </p> <p> His association with Thatcher didn't do him any good. \"I was identified in the intellectual world with this terrible woman - who I never knew, although I do now - and was blamed for everything she did, without me knowing what she would do.\" He did attempt to get on the Tory candidates' list in 1978 but was turned down - \"too bookish\". Soon after, he began a crash course in very practical politics. In 1979 he was invited to an aesthetics conference in Krakow, Poland. It was just after the election of a Polish Pope and just before the birth of Solidarity. \"Culpably, I had never engaged with communism,\" he says. </p> <p>\"When the Prague Spring happened in 1968, I so identified it with the ghastly students I'd seen in Paris I didn't have much sympathy, which I now realise was a terrible wrong. It showed a lack of moral imagination on my part and unfortunately I never acted upon it.\" </p> <p> His visit to Poland disturbed him. He then went on to Prague to give a secret lecture with the dissident Czech philosopher Julius Tomin. After the lecture he accompanied Tomin back to his apartment. Waiting for them at the entrance was a secret policeman who refused to let Scruton in and then threw him down the stairs. From then on Scruton was a marked man. He was eventually arrested when two policeman stepped out from behind a bush in Brno and soon after he was thrown out of the country.</p> <p> \"I realised that this was a situation that was complete outside anything in my experience,\" he says \"And at the same time this was a place which was dear to my heart. The intellectual life was genuinely dangerous. They were being put in jail by a left-wing police force.\"</p> <p>Along with other British academics, mostly from Oxford, he began to work with the Jan Hus educational trust - named after the 13th century Czech reformer and martyr - to provide books, support samizdat production and teach courses. The foreign office had been lukewarm about their activities until Malcolm Rifkind became minister of state with responsibility for eastern Europe in 1982. \"The foreign office's job was to maintain links with government,\" explains Rifkind, \"but I thought we could have links with unofficial bodies as well and should make contact with dissidents.\" He lent support to Scruton and others and commends their bravery. \"Travelling as an individual in quite hostile terrain, they were putting themselves at risk.\"</p> <p> Scruton learned Czech and threw himself in to the culture. Pavel Bratinka, a nuclear physicist in Prague who, because of his opposition to the regime, was forced to work as cleaner on the metro, attended Scruton's seminars. After communism collapsed he held several ministerial posts in the new government. \"As a thinker whose point of departure was conservative he was very important here,\" explains Bratinka. \"His reputation in academic circles is very high. They know that what he did was for no personal reward and we are extremely grateful to him. I hope after he dies they name a street for him here in Prague.\" </p> <p> After communism collapsed, to Bratinka's huge surprise, the alumni of his classes were suddenly in charge. Scruton formed a consultancy firm to make contacts between western businesses and the new governments. However, his friends' power was short-lived, and he is depressed that the communists hadn't gone away after all. \"They worked out that they would do far better if they gave up the nonsense of political power and just seized the assets of the country instead. They privatised the whole economy to themselves.\" </p> <p>He says he had no hope that communism would go away. \"I thought that perhaps we were keeping the light of learning burning just a little longer than it would have otherwise. But it was the right thing to do, and you do get comfort from doing something that is morally right. As there was no way this could be publicly known, that was the only motive for doing it. It was hugely important to me.\" Scruton was subsequently awarded the Czech republic's highest civilian honour for his work. </p> <p> During the 1980s he was having a very hard time. He says his columns in the Times and editorship of the Salisbury Review had identified him as an intellectual traitor, a rightwinger and a person of ill-repute. He then tried writing a novel, Francesca, about a grammar-school boy who falls for an upper-class girl, which reviewers rushed to annihilate. \"It felt unjust,\" he says. \"I don't mind people criticising me. I'm bound to be criticised because I say strong things that are controversial, although I do try to back them up. But that is not the same as being mocked and made to look ridiculous by people who don't understand what you are saying.\" </p> <p> So shaken was Scruton by the reviews of Francesca that he stopped writing fiction. Instead he turned his creative energies to music. He is a very good pianist and, perhaps surprisingly, has a keen appreciation of 20th century music. He wrote an opera, The Minister, about a politician who sacrifices his personal life to ambition. It was staged in the Czech republic and in Oxford. </p> <p> His other response to the relentless criticism in this country was to accept the post of professor of philosophy at Boston University in the US. While he says that many of the students weren't very good, \"those that were good were fantastic. Especially those from the bible belt, who were a gift to someone like me. They had that residue of European culture which most young people in England no longer have. American culture can be what you want: you can make around yourself a circle of people that are your type.\" This is more difficult to do in England. He claims English culture has become mediocratised in the last 10 years: the legitimisation of pop music and football as genuine manifestations of the nations culture being prime examples. </p> <p> His next novel, Xanthippic Dialogues, written in dialogue form about Plato's women, was better received, and encouraged Scruton to return home full-time. \"I'd found an idiom that synthesised my philosophical side and my fiction side. I always think that a world view is incomplete if it can't be embodied in some way in the human situation. This makes Shakespeare into a truly great philosopher.</p> <p> You can explore his characters and come across metaphysical layers and an archaeology of knowledge in each of them. I don't have the talent, but I would like to be a really serious philosopher who absolutely concretised his philosophy in individual characters in a situation that makes them live.\" </p> <p> A C Grayling says that \"the intellectual class and the academic class only fractionally overlap these days. Most academics are great experts in their field, but that's no guarantee they will be widely read and cultured individuals. Roger certainly is. He could see the wider picture and had an appreciation of the wider civilisation to go along with his academic and professional knowledge.\" </p> <p> Scruton says he regrets as a young man \"dithering\" as to what type of intellectual he should be. \"I knew since I had been in France that I was an intellectual in the French mould. I should be sitting in a cafe rather than a lecture room. But I was brought up on analytical philosophy. It isn't people showing off and trying to be incomprehensible and deep, but addressing real problems. It gets technical and dry and seems detached from ordinary human life and from culture and the spiritual - all the things you go to philosophy for as an amateur in the first place. </p> <p> \"Even though I knew it was a means, not an end, I should have been much more clear at the beginning that I would try to internalise that discipline but nevertheless be true to my cultural identity - somebody attempting to express a vision of human life rather than attacking tiny little problems within it. That's been hard but I think it has come together much more now.\" </p> <p> There is still a way to go before he can expect people to disentangle the personality of the man from his work. He says he was astonished by the reaction to his jokey piece on child-rearing. \"There was such a complete lack of a sense of humour in the people who responded to it. It was tongue-in-cheek. But of course irony can be difficult. That's why Socrates was put to death in Athens. His irony was not only a form of truth-telling but it made people inferior because they were. He brought them face to face with their own inferiority. No wonder they put him to death.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance: Roger Vernon Scruton </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> February 27 1944. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> High Wycombe Grammar School; Jesus College, Cambridge. </p> <p><strong> Married: </strong> 1973 Danielle Laffitte, divorced 1979; 1996 Sophie Jeffreys (one son, one daughter). </p> <p><strong> Career: </strong> Research fellow, Peterhouse, Cambridge 1969-71; Birkbeck College, lecturer in philosophy 1971-79, reader 1979-85, professor of aesthetics 1985-92; professor of philosophy Boston University 1992-95.

      "bodyText": "For Roger Scruton, as for so many of his generation, the Paris riots of May 1968 were the defining political moment of his life. He was in the Latin Quarter when students tore up the cobblestones to hurl at the riot police. His friends overturned cars and uprooted lamp-posts to erect the barricades. Representatives of his own discipline, old philosophers like Marx and new ones like Foucault, were providing the intellectual fuel for the fire raging on the ground. As he watched the events unfold from his apartment window, and listened to his friends, drunk on revolutionary hope and excitement, Scruton found his own emotions and opinions crystallising. \"I suddenly realised that I was on the other side,\" he says. \"What I saw was an unruly mob of self-indulgent middle-class hooligans. When I asked my friends what they wanted, what were they trying to achieve, all I got back was this ludicrous Marxist gobbledegook. I was disgusted by it, and thought there must be a way back to the defence of western civilisation against these things. That's when I became a conservative. I knew I wanted to conserve things rather than pull them down.\" His efforts to do this over the next three decades have made him one of the most contentious figures in British public life. As an academic, journalist and writer he has been a lightning rod for criticism and abuse from the left. While he has a reputation as a first class professional philosopher among other academics of all political persuasions, he has regularly been shouted down in universities and prevented from speaking. His books have been unmercifully slaughtered by reviewers and his pronouncements on society mocked. He is accused of being a grammar-school boy in thrall to the upper classes: \"it is all a bit like Charles Ryder in Brideshead\", says one observer. The fact that he used to go fox-hunting wearing Enoch Powell's old hunting clothes - the jacket split the first time he used it - says it all for many others. \"I do ask myself why I make people so enraged, because I only ever say what I think. And while I know it might not be everyone's point of view, that doesn't seem particularly intolerable to me.\" Part of the reason is, of course, straightforward political disagreement. As an academic in the 1980s, for instance, he did not make himself popular among his peers by defending education cuts. But this doesn't explain the venomous intensity of the attacks. For this, one must look at his interventions in social and cultural issues, where gut reactions can count for more than the sophistication of the argument. One such issue is national identity, which has increasingly entered the cultural and intellectual mainstream. Britishness has become a legitimate subject for discussion with two recent debates - one trivial, one less so - flickering across the public consciousness; the Runnymede Trust report on the future of multi-ethnic Britain, and whether the England football team should have a foreign coach. It wasn't always this way. The incendiary combination of nationality, race, history and culture was until recently something most sensible commentators avoided. But not Scruton. In 1982, as editor of the conservative philosophical journal The Salisbury Review, he published an article called Education And Race by Ray Honeyford, a Bradford headmaster. The gist was that multi-cultural education was actually harmful for immigrant children. \"All hell broke loose,\" recalls Scruton. \"But Ray Honeyford is not racist. He spent his whole life teaching Pakistani children in Bradford, trying to do the best for them against their parents and the mullahs. He recognised the terrible conflicts. But then, in the 80s, any questioning of the left-liberal orthodoxy could only have a racist motivation, or be seen to give succour to racists. I'd argue that not addressing these issues gives succour to racists. But it got us into terrible trouble.\" His latest book, England: An Elegy tries to show England as reflected in its own ideals, he says. \"I know ideals aren't realities, but they do influence reality - social, legal, political, cultural.\" Its reception shows the change in mood. Of course he gets his share of sneering reviews but there is a recognition of his breadth of reference and scholarship and he wins less grudging support from some surprising quarters. Labour Peer Melvyn Bragg describes it as \"an elegant and moving book\", before claiming Scruton \"is excellent at bringing common sense to bear on the distressing frenzy which has overtaken those whose views of England can only be doom-struck and void of all praise.\" Anthony Barnett, the founding director of Charter 88, who also has written on Englishness from a radical perspective, has worked with Scruton. Together they set up the Town and Country Forum to bring a non-partisan approach to discussion of urban and rural conflicts. He praises Scruton's willingness to engage. \"People who take these things seriously are trying not to think in received political terms any more,\" Barnett says. \"Agri-business, medical ethics, environmental questions can't just be thought about in terms of right and left. Even on a red-flag issue like hunting there is no simple left position.\" Scruton himself, for instance, is in favour of higher fuel taxes although he is not surprised that their implementation was so contentious. But for all this apparent reasonableness, he still puts himself out there to be shot at. Shortly after he first became a father, two years ago, at 54, he wrote a tongue-in-cheek article about childrearing. \"It goes without saying that Sam will not enjoy his childhood\", he said before going on to anticipate their \"nightly readings of the classics and our home performances of Shakespeare,\" and the young Sam, like John Stuart Mill, would be reading Greek by the age of six. The Guardian Diary responded by launching the Samuel Scruton Playstation appeal, but he was duly castigated and mocked elsewhere for his antediluvianism. Again, this hasn't stopped him writing about his own experiences, and his last two books have contained significant autobiographical content. The opening lines of his historical and social celebration, On Hunting, said his life divides into three parts. \"In the first, I was wretched; in the second, ill at ease; in the third, hunting.\" In England: An Elegy, his starting point is himself. \"TS Eliot said writing autobiography was, 'imposing order on and eliciting order in, one's life'.

Jack Scruton hated the upper class and loved the English countryside.

Two years later he moved to Birkbeck College, London. He was made professor of aesthetics in 1985 and stayed at the college until 1992. \"When I went to Birkbeck I was already in a conservative frame of mind,\" he says. \"My colleagues regarded me with great suspicion. The waves of 1968 had just reached London University. There were attempts to introduce more Foucault and Marx on to the curriculum. I had been brought up in Cambridge with this completely de-politicised view of what philosophy should be, so was obviously against all this.\" While at Birkbeck he read for the Bar as a fall-back position. \"I thought I might have to get out of this, and the law seemed a career where conservatives might be welcomed. I thought I ought to have an exit route.\" AC Grayling was a colleague in the Birkbeck philosophy department and says Scruton is a very good professional academic philosopher \"and a wonderful teacher of philosophy. The pedagogic works he wrote for students and the general public are clear, lucid and accurate. It is partly because of Roger's presence that the department is one of the best in the country.\" Grayling, who says he and Scruton disagree politically, also says what a \"very charming and somewhat sweet man,\" he is in person. \"This rather glum, obtuse figure who pops up every now again to say 'bring back hanging', or something, is not really characteristic of him.\" Ralph Walker of Magdalen College, Oxford, agrees about Scruton's academic stature, but claims that what he tries to do, at least part of the time, is to stimulate people. \"Some of the views he expresses in conversation or print are not necessarily views he would hold to the bitter end. They are often put in a provocative form for people to think about. Roger irritates people who find they don't like the position he's taken, but can't argue back. That can show itself as anger or accusations of extremism.\" This was Scruton's \"ill at ease\" period, made harder by a failed marriage. He had met Danielle Laffitte, a student, in France. After a long on-off affair they married in 1973, but were divorced in 1979. She still lives in England and they meet occasionally. \"It wasn't a very happy experience. I think marriages are much less stable if you live together first,\" he says. \"You don't have that sense of the metaphysical transformation from one condition to the next. The rite of passage is lost.\" He and Danielle didn't have children because there was, \"not sufficient commitment. Also there was selfishness. Perhaps if we had [children] we would have stayed together.\" Scruton did not become a father until two years ago when he and his second wife, Sophie Jeffreys, had Samuel. A second child, Lucy, was born last August. Jeffreys, an architectural historian, is 28 years his junior. They live contentedly on a farm in Wiltshire. Scruton also has a two-room apartment in Albany, the exclusive lodgings on London's Piccadilly. His rooms used to be the late MP Alan Clark's servant quarters. As Birkbeck only operated in the evenings, it gave Scruton time to pursue a career as a writer cum journalist as well as moving into the world of politics. He says he was appalled by the Heath government. \"There seemed to be a lot of thinking to be done and no-one was doing it.\" Along with the MP Hugh Fraser, Jonathan Aitken and academic John Casey, Scruton founded the Conservative Philosophy Group. Antonia Fraser, then married to Hugh Fraser, the Tory MP, and herself on the left, has been a friend since that time. Through her, Scruton got to know her present husband, Harold Pinter; this proved useful when Scruton was in financial difficulties. \"Wine has been the most important factor in my life, apart from women and song, but it can be an expensive taste. When I was a don at Cambridge I could buy it at cost and I bought a lot of 1961 clarets. But I fell on hard times and couldn't pay my tax bill so I sold the lot to Harold Pinter. He was the only person who would trust me that these bottles really were what I told him they were, because all the labels had come off. He was just marrying Antonia and wanted a proper cellar. He was very generous and did invite me to drink some of it afterwards.\" Scruton is often associated with Margaret Thatcher's reinvigoration of the Conservative party through a red-blooded commitment to the market in the mid 1970s. But he says that process happened quite independently of anything he was doing. \"Thatcher was completely indifferent to our kind of conservative philosophy. I'd never heard of her gurus - people like Alan Walters and Alfred Sherman.\" Scruton was associated with writers at the Spectator and Telegraph, exponents of a more settled, patrician conservatism. \"It was about a subdued sense of the importance of history and tradition, of doing things in an orderly way. Small-scale improvements. The market economy was a good thing but it wasn't the foundation of social order, and should be heavily qualified by all the traditions that enable people to live with each other rather than just compete. But under Thatcher it was completely the free market.\" His association with Thatcher didn't do him any good. \"I was identified in the intellectual world with this terrible woman - who I never knew, although I do now - and was blamed for everything she did, without me knowing what she would do.\" He did attempt to get on the Tory candidates' list in 1978 but was turned down - \"too bookish\". Soon after, he began a crash course in very practical politics. In 1979 he was invited to an aesthetics conference in Krakow, Poland. It was just after the election of a Polish Pope and just before the birth of Solidarity. \"Culpably, I had never engaged with communism,\" he says. \"When the Prague Spring happened in 1968, I so identified it with the ghastly students I'd seen in Paris I didn't have much sympathy, which I now realise was a terrible wrong. It showed a lack of moral imagination on my part and unfortunately I never acted upon it.\" His visit to Poland disturbed him. He then went on to Prague to give a secret lecture with the dissident Czech philosopher Julius Tomin. After the lecture he accompanied Tomin back to his apartment. Waiting for them at the entrance was a secret policeman who refused to let Scruton in and then threw him down the stairs. From then on Scruton was a marked man. He was eventually arrested when two policeman stepped out from behind a bush in Brno and soon after he was thrown out of the country. \"I realised that this was a situation that was complete outside anything in my experience,\" he says \"And at the same time this was a place which was dear to my heart. The intellectual life was genuinely dangerous. They were being put in jail by a left-wing police force.\" Along with other British academics, mostly from Oxford, he began to work with the Jan Hus educational trust - named after the 13th century Czech reformer and martyr - to provide books, support samizdat production and teach courses. The foreign office had been lukewarm about their activities until Malcolm Rifkind became minister of state with responsibility for eastern Europe in 1982. \"The foreign office's job was to maintain links with government,\" explains Rifkind, \"but I thought we could have links with unofficial bodies as well and should make contact with dissidents.\" He lent support to Scruton and others and commends their bravery. \"Travelling as an individual in quite hostile terrain, they were putting themselves at risk.\" Scruton learned Czech and threw himself in to the culture. Pavel Bratinka, a nuclear physicist in Prague who, because of his opposition to the regime, was forced to work as cleaner on the metro, attended Scruton's seminars. After communism collapsed he held several ministerial posts in the new government. \"As a thinker whose point of departure was conservative he was very important here,\" explains Bratinka. \"His reputation in academic circles is very high. They know that what he did was for no personal reward and we are extremely grateful to him. I hope after he dies they name a street for him here in Prague.\" After communism collapsed, to Bratinka's huge surprise, the alumni of his classes were suddenly in charge. Scruton formed a consultancy firm to make contacts between western businesses and the new governments. However, his friends' power was short-lived, and he is depressed that the communists hadn't gone away after all. \"They worked out that they would do far better if they gave up the nonsense of political power and just seized the assets of the country instead. They privatised the whole economy to themselves.\" He says he had no hope that communism would go away. \"I thought that perhaps we were keeping the light of learning burning just a little longer than it would have otherwise. But it was the right thing to do, and you do get comfort from doing something that is morally right. As there was no way this could be publicly known, that was the only motive for doing it. It was hugely important to me.\" Scruton was subsequently awarded the Czech republic's highest civilian honour for his work. During the 1980s he was having a very hard time. He says his columns in the Times and editorship of the Salisbury Review had identified him as an intellectual traitor, a rightwinger and a person of ill-repute. He then tried writing a novel, Francesca, about a grammar-school boy who falls for an upper-class girl, which reviewers rushed to annihilate. \"It felt unjust,\" he says. \"I don't mind people criticising me. I'm bound to be criticised because I say strong things that are controversial, although I do try to back them up. But that is not the same as being mocked and made to look ridiculous by people who don't understand what you are saying.\" So shaken was Scruton by the reviews of Francesca that he stopped writing fiction. Instead he turned his creative energies to music. He is a very good pianist and, perhaps surprisingly, has a keen appreciation of 20th century music. He wrote an opera, The Minister, about a politician who sacrifices his personal life to ambition. It was staged in the Czech republic and in Oxford. His other response to the relentless criticism in this country was to accept the post of professor of philosophy at Boston University in the US. While he says that many of the students weren't very good, \"those that were good were fantastic. Especially those from the bible belt, who were a gift to someone like me. They had that residue of European culture which most young people in England no longer have. American culture can be what you want: you can make around yourself a circle of people that are your type.\" This is more difficult to do in England. He claims English culture has become mediocratised in the last 10 years: the legitimisation of pop music and football as genuine manifestations of the nations culture being prime examples. His next novel, Xanthippic Dialogues, written in dialogue form about Plato's women, was better received, and encouraged Scruton to return home full-time. \"I'd found an idiom that synthesised my philosophical side and my fiction side. I always think that a world view is incomplete if it can't be embodied in some way in the human situation. This makes Shakespeare into a truly great philosopher. You can explore his characters and come across metaphysical layers and an archaeology of knowledge in each of them. I don't have the talent, but I would like to be a really serious philosopher who absolutely concretised his philosophy in individual characters in a situation that makes them live.\" A C Grayling says that \"the intellectual class and the academic class only fractionally overlap these days. Most academics are great experts in their field, but that's no guarantee they will be widely read and cultured individuals. Roger certainly is. He could see the wider picture and had an appreciation of the wider civilisation to go along with his academic and professional knowledge.\" Scruton says he regrets as a young man \"dithering\" as to what type of intellectual he should be. \"I knew since I had been in France that I was an intellectual in the French mould. I should be sitting in a cafe rather than a lecture room. But I was brought up on analytical philosophy. It isn't people showing off and trying to be incomprehensible and deep, but addressing real problems. It gets technical and dry and seems detached from ordinary human life and from culture and the spiritual - all the things you go to philosophy for as an amateur in the first place. \"Even though I knew it was a means, not an end, I should have been much more clear at the beginning that I would try to internalise that discipline but nevertheless be true to my cultural identity - somebody attempting to express a vision of human life rather than attacking tiny little problems within it. That's been hard but I think it has come together much more now.\" There is still a way to go before he can expect people to disentangle the personality of the man from his work. He says he was astonished by the reaction to his jokey piece on child-rearing. \"There was such a complete lack of a sense of humour in the people who responded to it. It was tongue-in-cheek. But of course irony can be difficult. That's why Socrates was put to death in Athens. His irony was not only a form of truth-telling but it made people inferior because they were. He brought them face to face with their own inferiority. No wonder they put him to death.\" Life at a glance: Roger Vernon Scruton Born: February 27 1944.

      "body": "<p>I have never been a good or conscientious letter-writer. My father, in contrast, was an inveterate letter-writer, always firing off missives in his beautiful, slanted handwriting. He wrote to me after his arrest and I replied, commiserating with him but explaining that I was busy settling into my first job since leaving journalism school. I told him about the difficulties I was having trying to place the story of his arrest in the British media. It was a small lie, because all I had done was send out a press release. I knew, deep down, that he was innocent, but acknowledging his innocence would mean I would have to abandon my life to help him. And not only would I be pulled into the struggle, but I would have to take a position against my cousins who had already publicly sworn to avenge their father's death.</p> <p>I told him that my cousins and other Ogoni in London and in Nigeria had been trying to persuade my mother to turn against him. I wanted him to realise that his fate was in my mother's hands, to pay him back for all the times he had hurt her. I wanted him to sit in his cell and contemplate the fact that she would be justified in taking her family's side against him. It was a cruel thing to do, but our emotional attachment had been almost severed by the years of mutual suspicion and misunderstanding.</p> <p>I didn't hear from him for two months. In a way, his silence was a relief because it shielded me from having to make a decision I would have been happy to put off for the rest of my life. I buried my head in the sand, hoping the situation would somehow resolve itself.</p> <p>But the silence was unbearable. His silence and my own.</p> <p>I flinch now at how cold I was. It seems obvious, especially with the benefit of hindsight, that anything, however banal, would have kept his spirits up. But I was paralysed by an awareness that if I wrote to him, I would have to answer the issue dangling like a large question mark between his hot, filthy prison cell in Port Harcourt and my comfortable misery in London: What was I going to do?</p> <p>A letter arrived from Nigeria.</p> <p>Dear Junior, <br>I have not heard from you in months. <br>Your father</p> <p>Only three lines, but three lines that spoke volumes. In that anguished letter, I felt his pain, his anger. He must have thought that I had abandoned him. I threw it in the bin. I felt my anger was justified, but the letter sat in the bin, insisting that I stand up for my father. At last, some time later, I wrote a long letter to my father. I have kept almost all the letters my father ever wrote to me, but I wish I had been as careful and conscientious with my own. I wish I could retrieve that particular letter I wrote, because it changed the dynamics of our relationship.</p> <p>What I do remember clearly is that I finally found the courage to confront my father about his relationship with my mother. I told him he was lucky to have a wife like her, and I explained that she had always been responsible for keeping his children, especially me, loyal to him, that she had never once tried to turn me against him. He had done that all by himself. I told him that she had always advised me to stand by him, no matter how rough their marriage was for her. I reminded him that he hadn't always been as faithful, and that he had often tried to blame her for his difficulties with his children.</p> <p>I also told him I was going to marry Olivia; I went about it in a cautious, circumspect way. I had read somewhere that Ogoni were forbidden to marry outside their race, and I somehow imagined that since he had become such an Ogoni nationalist, he would disapprove of my choosing to marry outside. His reply came back to me in less than a week. Nigeria's notorious postal system had never been so efficient. He described my letter as \"a very encouraging and cheering Xmas gift\". He wrote positively about my mother, my upcoming wedding, the need to work hard and to save. That letter remains the most important one my father ever wrote to me. But as was my wont in those days, I zeroed in on his criticisms of me: I was ashamed that he felt I was \"lazy\". He could have said I was lacking in direction, but my father never minced his words, especially when he was trying to motivate me. It did the trick, however, because I handed in my notice at work the very next day. I decided it was time to show him what I could do. At the time, I rationalised my decision as giving up my life to try to save his.

The name Ken Saro-Wiwa had lost some of its personal meaning to me. He was already a symbol in my mind, and it took a few moments before it registered that my father had just been sentenced to death.

The only noises I could hear were the sporadic sounds of early morning traffic drifting in and out of my room from the streets outside. When I heard a timid knock on my door, I jumped out of bed and threw on some clothes. My hands were shaking as Richard Boele, a fellow activist, slipped into the room. He was as pale as a ghost.

      "bodyText": "I have never been a good or conscientious letter-writer. My father, in contrast, was an inveterate letter-writer, always firing off missives in his beautiful, slanted handwriting. He wrote to me after his arrest and I replied, commiserating with him but explaining that I was busy settling into my first job since leaving journalism school. I told him about the difficulties I was having trying to place the story of his arrest in the British media. It was a small lie, because all I had done was send out a press release. I knew, deep down, that he was innocent, but acknowledging his innocence would mean I would have to abandon my life to help him. And not only would I be pulled into the struggle, but I would have to take a position against my cousins who had already publicly sworn to avenge their father's death. I told him that my cousins and other Ogoni in London and in Nigeria had been trying to persuade my mother to turn against him. I wanted him to realise that his fate was in my mother's hands, to pay him back for all the times he had hurt her. I wanted him to sit in his cell and contemplate the fact that she would be justified in taking her family's side against him. It was a cruel thing to do, but our emotional attachment had been almost severed by the years of mutual suspicion and misunderstanding. I didn't hear from him for two months. In a way, his silence was a relief because it shielded me from having to make a decision I would have been happy to put off for the rest of my life. I buried my head in the sand, hoping the situation would somehow resolve itself. But the silence was unbearable. His silence and my own. I flinch now at how cold I was. It seems obvious, especially with the benefit of hindsight, that anything, however banal, would have kept his spirits up. But I was paralysed by an awareness that if I wrote to him, I would have to answer the issue dangling like a large question mark between his hot, filthy prison cell in Port Harcourt and my comfortable misery in London: What was I going to do? A letter arrived from Nigeria. Dear Junior, I have not heard from you in months. Your father Only three lines, but three lines that spoke volumes. In that anguished letter, I felt his pain, his anger. He must have thought that I had abandoned him. I threw it in the bin. I felt my anger was justified, but the letter sat in the bin, insisting that I stand up for my father. At last, some time later, I wrote a long letter to my father. I have kept almost all the letters my father ever wrote to me, but I wish I had been as careful and conscientious with my own. I wish I could retrieve that particular letter I wrote, because it changed the dynamics of our relationship. What I do remember clearly is that I finally found the courage to confront my father about his relationship with my mother. I told him he was lucky to have a wife like her, and I explained that she had always been responsible for keeping his children, especially me, loyal to him, that she had never once tried to turn me against him. He had done that all by himself. I told him that she had always advised me to stand by him, no matter how rough their marriage was for her. I reminded him that he hadn't always been as faithful, and that he had often tried to blame her for his difficulties with his children. I also told him I was going to marry Olivia; I went about it in a cautious, circumspect way. I had read somewhere that Ogoni were forbidden to marry outside their race, and I somehow imagined that since he had become such an Ogoni nationalist, he would disapprove of my choosing to marry outside. His reply came back to me in less than a week. Nigeria's notorious postal system had never been so efficient. He described my letter as \"a very encouraging and cheering Xmas gift\". He wrote positively about my mother, my upcoming wedding, the need to work hard and to save. That letter remains the most important one my father ever wrote to me. But as was my wont in those days, I zeroed in on his criticisms of me: I was ashamed that he felt I was \"lazy\". He could have said I was lacking in direction, but my father never minced his words, especially when he was trying to motivate me. It did the trick, however, because I handed in my notice at work the very next day. I decided it was time to show him what I could do. At the time, I rationalised my decision as giving up my life to try to save his. But when I look back on it, it is probably fairer to say that I had decided to make something of my life by trying to save his.

      "body": "<p>\"When you see the Nobel Peace Prize pinned on the chest of a man whose maps still do not depict the state of Israel, then you know there is nothing you can do. The hyena never changes his spots.\" I say, this is crazy. Where is the hope? Where is the way forward? \"The only hope now,\" - he sips his coffee - \"is the passage of time. Arafat can never be the solution, because he will always be the problem. For as long as my Arab neighbours go on choosing him, there is no hope whatsoever.</p> <p>\"People know this. They know it but they don't want to face it. They go round saying \"Oh wouldn't it be nice if it all worked out somehow? They know the facts but they refuse to draw the conclusion. It won't work out.\"</p> <p>We are all taken aback by Begin, his intellectual command, his profound and daunting pessimism, and Sigal has gone into one of her silent moods, as if the effort of listening without interrupting has terminally lowered her spirits. I scarcely have time to worry about this. For today I have decided to walk through the mirror into Israel's twin, its underside.</p> <p> Nothing prepares you for the physical shock of the passage into Gaza. One writer has said that driving from Israel into the Gaza Strip is like driving from California into Bangladesh. You become so used to the broad highways, the easy sensuality of Israel that it is the sight of dust, sudden dust, an unholy big brown storm of pure dirt, which alerts you to the fact that you are about to enter a society where people earn precisely 8% of what their opposite numbers earn in Israel.</p> <p>Keith Lawrence and I set off on foot across the concrete strip which divides the two countries. For a moment, it is like a John Le Carre movie, as we carry our bags past gun towers down the wide empty road. And at the exact half-way point, just as in the movies, I am seized, bundled into a waiting car and driven quickly away, admittedly by two friendly young Englishwomen. The reason for this haste, it turns out, is that Susannah and Pauline, my new British Council handlers, have just told me that in 20 minutes I will be meeting with Haider Abdel Shafi. Shafi is the most popular politician in Gaza and it is something of a mystery why he has agreed to see me, since he sees no one. </p> <p>As we travel along a potholed track - you couldn't call it a road - towards the city of Gaza, I am taken aback by what I am seeing. Gaza is an area 45 kilometres by eight. Even now, one-third of it is held by the Israelis, on behalf of just 6,000 religious settlers. Around them are crammed 750,000 Palestinians, half of whom live in the refugee camps, which were temporarily established in 1948.</p> <p>Dusk comes down and we have stepped back 60 years. As we push past the donkeys Pauline says: \"It's a good day today because it's not been raining. When it rains, there's no drainage and the main street can be under three feet of water. Turds float past the car window,\" she says. There are rudiments of civilisation - yellow dustbins, donated by the European Union ; donkeys queue at the 18 sets of traffic lights, donated by the French; and in a bizarre job creation scheme there are innumerable young boys dressed as policemen, and universally ignored. </p> <p>As soon as we are ushered into Haider Abdel Shafi's elegant living room, it becomes clear why he has agreed to meet me. He believes that I am the Guardian journalist, David Hirst, and, as such, the author of a recent two-page expose straplined \"Shameless in Gaza\". Since the 70-year-old Shafi has lately resigned from the legislative body in protest at the notorious corruption of Arafat's regime, he is keen to congratulate me on my work. It seems somehow appropriate to this peculiar, hushed city that a man who knows nothing is now about to interview a man who thinks he is someone else.</p> <p>\"If I want to find excuses for Arafat, then I suppose I can say he has spent his whole life in a liberation movement, and he is unused to not getting his way. Hundreds of millions of dollars have simply disappeared. Arafat is a man who buys peoples' allegiance. But in a society where law is neglected and never enforced, nothing can ever be right.\"</p> <p>I ask what effect the lawlessness is having on the peace process. Shafi smiles. \"There is no peace process. Even by pretending that there is such a thing, we play into Israeli hands. I was in Washington for 20 months negotiating, so I know how Israelis think. Their position has never changed. All they are doing is using settlements to establish their presence in the land, and then to treat it as a fait accompli. It's a strategy, nothing more.\" </p> <p>Shafi gets up to offer us Turkish coffee and chocolates from a big tin of Milk Tray. He twinkles at the ladies, who glow back from the sofa. \"President Clinton has no interest in the indigenous people of Palestine, who were here long before the Israelis arrived. He wants settlement-building to stop. But for him it's not a matter of principle. It's a tactic in his peace process. It's a pause he wants, not a stop.\" How does Arafat feel? \"I have no idea. He refuses to reveal his thinking. Friends say he is depressed. I cannot wonder he is depressed.</p> <p>\"Our most urgent task is to reform ourselves. It's far more important than negotiation with Israel. You can't get anywhere if you live in a society without principles. When Mohammed came back from battle, he said: \"Raja na min al jihadil-asgar ila l-jihadi l-akbar. We come back from the little strife and we return to the bigger strife. The strife of the soul.' But of course nowadays, nobody thinks about these things.\"</p> <p>It is Shafi's achievement to create a calm in us all, and the calm lasts as we step out onto the empty street. I ask: \"Where does Arafat live?\" It's dark and not a soul moves. We drive towards the sea. We turn. A quiet avenue of villas. At the end of this road of seaside vernacular, two enormous tanks. Behind them, Arafat's house, looking like any other.</p> <p>We get out. Silence. Only the roar of the surf, the Mediterranean. \"There'll be a civil war,\" says Pauline. \"It's inevitable. The society is simply not functioning.\"</p> <p>Later, it is Pauline who finally sets me straight. She is here to help the Palestinians set up a civil service. \"What you're seeing, I'm afraid, is the result of the intifada. You have to understand that was a real revolution, and it came up from below, not from the leadership. But now . . . well it's like that film with Meryl Streep. What's it called?\" \"You mean the one where she's meant to be Danish?\" \"No, not that one. The one set during the war.\" \"Oh, Plenty,\" I say, \"I wrote it.\" She looks at me suspiciously. \"Well anyway, the figure of the woman - what's she called?\" \"Susan Traherne.\" \"Yes, the woman who goes to war at 20 and for whom the peace is this terrible disappointment. It's the same here. It's like Plenty. These kids were 13 or 14, some of them even seven or eight, and they found they could create their own structures. They could have a direct and devastating effect on daily life in Israel. By their actions they truly achieved something. But now the energy is gone. The men from Tunis came and stole it. Those same kids have grown up and are sitting around in cafes. They have no jobs, they have no life, they're totally disillusioned. </p> <p>\"There was a point once, there was a reason. You were fighting for a Palestinian state, and you were willing to die. What on earth would you die for now? If you struggled now, you would be arrested, and tortured and put to death, all so that Arafat can go on being corrupt. There are more people in prison today under Arafat than there were under the Israelis! What's the point of dying for a society without rules? If the Israelis were really clever, they would give the Palestinians every inch of land they want, and then stand by and watch them fuck it up.\" This is a terrible analysis, but it's confirmed when I next travel, this time to the Arab city of Ramallah. My official companion is Muna Khlefi, a sparkling, clever Palestinian who thinks I am incredibly lucky to have met Haider Abdel Shafi and who wants to hear every word. \"He is a great man. He is the guts, he is the soul of the country. The new leadership just want to do business. They did business in Lebanon, they did it in Tunis. They say: just make money, then later we'll decide what kind of society we want. But Shafi says you cannot delay this question.\" Muna wants me to meet Albert Aghazerin, the great Palestinian historian, to talk about the problem of Jerusalem. He is late, so I sit in his outer office at Birzeit University, looking out onto the hillside campus. I pick up the Amnesty International report on Palestine. \"Subjects have been electrocuted, hanged upside down. Scalding plastic has been melted over their bodies... \"</p> <p>After an hour, Aghazerin arrives, a frightening figure with a big pipe and a superb sculpted face, rather like the actor Anthony Quinn. He thrusts an article at me, ordering me to read it. When I dare to ask a question, he sighs and says: \"Where do you start? For me you can only answer this by considering the Egyptian conquest of 1831,\" and at once he sets off on a canter through 19th-century statistics which I can't grasp, partly because he scares me so much, and partly because his mind is leaping about like an angry gazelle. </p> <p>However, when I ask him what he thinks the religious Jew truly believes, he starts to cheer up, pleased that we turn out to share a common interest. \"All this apocalyptic stuff only starts after 1967. You do get a whiff of it before but it's only after the six day war that the Jews come up with this new interpretation of the Bible. The building of the Third Temple! The end of the world! Please! It's pure opportunism. Religious revelation which just happens to be the most perfect political connivance.</p> <p>\"There are women in Jerusalem who've actually started sewing the garments for the priests of the Third Temple and they're preparing the unblemished... ANIMAL. You know, what is it? That... what is it? Animal, begins with h? H!\", he shouts. \"Heifer?\" \"That's right! HEIFER! They are preparing the unblemished HEIFER to purge the temple. And of course it all suits Israel fine. But groups like this always bring violence and bloodshed. Rabin's assassination did not come out of nothing.\"</p> <p>I ask him if he thinks Israel divided. \"Deeply, deeply divided. There are three Israels now. The hedonistic Israel of Tel-Aviv. The austere Israel of Jerusalem. And the mad Israel of Hebron which wants only vengeance and blood.</p> <p>\"Look I do not discount what the Jews suffered. Nobody can. I know what they suffered in Europe. But to me it is as if they jumped from a burning building and happened to land and break the neck of a man who was passing. And when the man says 'Hey, you've broken my neck', they say 'Sorry, it's because of the fire'. And when the man says \"yes, but my neck's broken', they just break his arm to try and shut him up. And when he doesn't shut up, they break his other arm. Then his leg. Then his other leg. All in the hope that one day he'll shut up. But, you see, I don't think he will.</p> <p>\"I like these parables. I will give you another. Israel has its hands round our throat. He can't throttle us, but nor can he let us go. He's unhappy because he wants to go for a beer, and we're unhappy because we're being strangled, but in some terrible way we are bound up in each other's unhappiness. We cannot be separated.\"</p> <p>I ask him if it will change. \"It will stink before it changes. You have to ask yourself about the so-called peace process: is its purpose the exchange of land, or is it the subjugation of the Palestinian people? Because, on the ground, there's no question all the evidence points to the second. What is the reason for all these stupid checkpoints, and the impossibility of Arabs getting a visa to visit Jerusalem? Arabs can't visit Jerusalem!\" </p> <p>On the road home to Jerusalem the other night he was stopped, as he always is, at the checkpoint. The army girl who was no older than his own daughter started to go through all his luggage. When she put his things back he said: \"Do you like what you do? I have a daughter, and I will give her the right to do many things, but not this, because this is dehumanising. Do you know what she replied? 'I'm doing a job. I don't think about it. Now goodbye.' </p> <p>\"Shall I sum it up for you? They always ask two questions. Did you pack the bag yourself? And did anyone give you anything to carry? The other day I answered the first question, then I added, 'And no-one gave me anything to carry.' The Israeli guard looked at me furious: 'How dare you? Don't you know : you are not allowed to answer the second question until I ask it?' \"David, that says it all.\"</p> <p>Albert and I part firm friends. And my own spirits are reflected in the cheerful air of Ramallah, the largest Arab city in the West Bank, where women wear dresses and where alcohol is served in the restaurants.</p> <p>On the way to the Presto cafe, where I am to meet the producer of Romeo and Juliet, Muna explains that George Ibrahim is one of the few people in Palestine allowed to make theatre. On arrival, George turns out to be bear-like and convivial, punching my arm whenever he makes a good point.</p> <p>George attacks the portrayal of Arabs in western films. \"We are always just puppets. You play with us according to your imagination, so we are monkeys smoking pipes, or more usually, criminals. I hate Hamas myself, so I know that extremists are criminals. But I also know why. I know why they commit crimes. Think! Just think! Think what depths of despair it will take to make you walk into a market with lumps of dynamite tied round your chest. But no American film-maker has ever tried to think. All Arabs get lumped together.\"</p> <p>His friend, the poet of the intifada, Hussein Barghouti joins in. \"Did you see... did you see The English Patient? Foreground action: white people, noble, fine feelings, strong, full of laughter, walking in gardens, taking showers, oh standing up! Background action: Arabs, shifty, mysterious, dirty, untrustworthy, oh sitting down! Or Air Force One! This picture explains to us what Arabs want. What do they want? To capture the American president! Why? Why would anyone want the American president? Why would they do that? No, really? The reason? Because the world needs an enemy. When the Soviet Union was around, there it was, ready-made. Now it's to be us. It suits the Americans to say, 'Who are the Arabs? The Arabs are the people who will start the third world war.'</p> <p>\"You know, I have been reading Mishima and he is very moving on this subject. The destruction of Japanese culture by the west. The west injecting violence into a culture. All the conflicts in this area are imported. They are not organic. The west came here to find its religion. Yet how did you bring it back to us? In the form of the Crusades! You collect your religion from this part of the world, then you bring it back to us as violence.\"</p> <p>I'm happy in Ramallah, it's less desperate, less disturbing than Gaza, but every night I travel back to Jerusalem, where not only half the world's religions originated but also - hardly by coincidence - where the world first started collecting crime statistics. Yes, Crime Number One. It happened in Jerusalem. Cain killed Abel. </p> <p>At Oslo, the question of how Jerusalem should be administered was put to one side as being simply too difficult even to approach. For this Jerusalem is the world capital of claim and counter-claim, the acknowledged metropolis of dispute. Here, contention, abrasion and mistrust are scored deep into the subtly pink rock. </p> <p>\"The angry face of Yahweh,\" says Arthur Koestler, \"broods over hot rocks which have seen more holy murder, rape and plunder than any other place on earth.\" \"The air over Jerusalem,\" says Herman Melville, \"is saturated with prayers and dreams... it's hard to breathe.\" For me, there's no question: I have to walk the Via Dolorosa, to follow the Stations of the Cross, which represent the steps on Christ's journey to his death. \"All these stones, all this sadness, all this light.\" It's the religion of my homeland, even if homeland's not a word I've ever used. But the shock is to realise just how little impact Christianity has made. It's amusing to see bus-loads of American evangelicals, dressed in shell suits and baseball caps, searching vainly in an old Arab city for any remaining evidence of Our Lord. \"There ought to be more. What's happened? Why is there not more?\"</p> <p>To be honest, I share their bewilderment. After all, Christianity's a well-known religion and I'd say influential in its day. You'd think it was still worth a pilgrimage, but in this town, we come a sporting third. We're the sideshow. The Via Dolorosa is a pavement which winds unimpressively past postcard shops and up narrow alleys, filling me with a sense of loss, with a tangible sense of something lost - until it reaches the Church of the Holy Sepulchre which - wouldn't you know, wouldn't you just guess it? - is also disputed. Yes, even the church which contains the stone where our Lord was crucified is shared unhappily: 70% to the Greeks and the rest doled out higgeldy-piggeldy between the Armenian Christians, the Coptic Christians, the Latins, the Syrians and the Ethiopians. A people divided by a common religion. Sects and the single church.</p> <p>And what's more - hold on, here we go - is the stone on the right spot? Nobody knows. Archaeologists also dispute. Nobody can know because nobody knows where the city walls were. Nobody agrees. Where was Calvary indeed? So for now - look, is anything certain? - let's just do as the family next to me and drop alarmingly to our knees, on the working assumption - let's just assume - X marks the spot, and kiss the stone. After all does the literal truth of it matter? Does the literal truth matter? Aren't we kissing an idea? Stones or ideas? Stones or ideas?</p> <p>And it's a relief, I'd say a relief, to come out of the dark and stroll down to the big open plaza where you find the Wailing Wall, strangely impressive, tall, uncrowded, the bit where the Jews are allowed. For towering above them at the very top of the arrangement, is the most coveted spot in the universe of faith, what the Jews call Temple Mount, but what to the Arabs who occupy it is known as the Haram al-Sharif. And at its centre, the saffron-yellow golden Dome of the Rock.</p> <p>I have felt since I arrived that Jerusalem doesn't need my admiration. Enough people are obsessed with it already. The truth is, I look at it and think how beautiful it must have been when it was a small town. Myself, I would like Jerusalem more if it were less important. But even I, inside the Arab sanctuary, taking in the cleanest, most oxygenated sun-dazzled air you ever breathed, looking across to the Mount of Olives, yield to the splendour of the place and realise: oh I see, how provoking it is to own beauty, to own the most breathtaking space of them all.</p> <p>Coming down, Sigal is waiting. I haven't seen the delightful Sigal for some time, because I have been, as it were, with the other lot, and so she is spilling over with gossip: Netanyahu's government is falling, or is about to fall, or may not fall, because of some scandal about money and loans. I get into the car. The driver doesn't know the city, so we circle for some time. It's interesting. When we stop people in the street to ask them the way to Yad Vashem, the world-famous museum of the Holocaust, some of them don't seem to know.</p> <p>The museum's power is in its very simplicity, a bleak photographic record ending not, as westerners expect, in 1945, but in 1948 at the foundation of the state. At the centre of the display, I stop at the text of Himmler's speech, the most astonishing document of the war, in which he congratulates his men on the discipline they have shown in exerting what he calls their \"moral right\" to exterminate the Jews.</p> <p>It is, Himmler says, \"natural tact\" which prevents any German from speaking of what they are doing. Himmler knows it is hard work, digging pits and throwing bodies into them. But what he is proudest of is that in doing this work his men have - the phrase resonates down the century - his men have \"stayed decent\", and it is staying decent \"that has made us hard\".</p> <p>The only false notes in the museum are hit by works of art. Sculpture and painting. They seem superfluous. In every case the gesture seems inadequate. What is a painting, a painting of a starving man? What is a painting of a corpse? It's the facts we want. Give us the facts. We go into the dark, into the Hall of Names. Here, every Jew who is known to have died between 1939 and 1945 is given a simple file. Finally, after so many years, numbers are given the dignity of becoming human beings. In this sombre room of open shelves, the scale of the Nazi offence, its deliberateness is revealed. The unbroken rank of documentation hits you more shockingly, more woundingly, than any other image. </p> <p>We walk in the Garden of Remembrance. We begin to feel the sun. Voltaire said you must choose between countries where you sweat and countries where you think. The confusing thing about Israel is that it's one where you do both. And my mind is racing now. We're all blind. We all see only what we want to. Don't we blank out the rest?</p> <p>And me more than anyone. At times I'm the worst of the lot. I've seen a good many politicians while I'm here but at the end I'm due to meet one who's lost all hope of office. I'm used to hours getting past the security arrangements for the minister of something or other, but my last visit is to a tiny, unsecured basement in Tel-Aviv. I have already noticed that just the name of Shulamit Aloni is enough to attract violent hostility from some who knew her as the flaming red firebrand of the Rabin government.</p> <p>And as she comes already talking into the room she is like a manic depressive Melina Mercouri with thick glasses and no time to wait for the questions.</p> <p>\"What you want to know?\" she asks, throwing herself down into the biggest armchair. \"Why do you say it's difficult to understand what's happening? It couldn't be simpler. We're going backwards. What's so difficult to understand? Jews were once victims, so we are brainwashed to believe we will always be victims and victims can do no wrong. Suddenly we've become strong and greedy and pretend we can justify everything. We're told all the time the Palestinians want to throw us into the sea. We have six million people and the strongest army in the region. And yet we speak of them as if they were two equal powers. It's just manipulating peoples' fears.\"</p> <p>She raps out an order in Hebrew for Sigal to go and get some coffee. Sigal gets up, furious, while Shulamit carries on, blaming the reversal entirely on Netanyahu. I am enjoying Shulamit - she is absolutely, as they say, my cup of tea - but even I am a little surprised by her blaming Netanyahu for everything. Are things ever really down to one man? \"You are English and I assume you went to high school\" she says, rather nastily, \"so you will have heard of the philosopher Hobbes. Hobbes says a whole society can be destroyed by a single individual who decides to come along and burn down the forest. Netanyahu, aided by the greedy fascists, the army, the security service, is such a man.\"</p> <p>I ask what she can do meanwhile. Does she just wait? \"To wait means to die. I have no optimistic things to tell you. Why come to me? What are you doing here? Go to the younger people and ask them what they think.\" She is staring at me, as if it's the first time she's noticed me at all. \"Why you write down my blah-blah?\"</p> <p>I say that I normally start an interview by explaining what I am doing here, but somehow we had skipped that stage. \"It's a bad time. What can I say?\" \"It's what you feel.\" \"No, it's not what I feel. It's what I know. If it were only what I feel I'd go and have a brandy and I'd feel better. I'm not telling you my mood, though my mood is bad. I'm telling you the facts. I am gloomy. But what do I matter?\"</p> <p>She looks me in the eye, challenging me to defy her. This talented lawyer, who has done as much as anyone to offer practical support to the victims of discrimination and segregation, is lost, in pain, painfully lost and spoiling for a fight. \"What do you see happening next?\" \"Demonstrations, bloodshed, bitterness. It's not yet a civil war, but it's a form of civil war. It's a Kulturkampf. Do you know what that is?\" I nod. \"We are in the middle of one. The great mistake was to give power to the clergy in the first place. And immigrants came from eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, they were backward, they knew nothing about democracy. They think democracy is the rule by the majority. What's worst, we have no written constitution...\" I have not opened my mouth and already she is shouting at me. \"Don't tell me you don't have one in England! I know that! I know that! But you have the Magna Carta and Oliver Cromwell and a tradition, and until recently you had the idea that certain things are not done.\"</p> <p>She gets up. It ends as abruptly as it begins. \"Anything else? I have to run.\" I am aware this woman's world was destroyed by Rabin's death. She shakes my hand. \"The British caused a lot of problems here.\" \"I know that\". \"Do you know what I say to the British? Since you left, we love you very much. And I mean it. We do.\"</p> <p>We walk back to the British Council, Sigal fuming at the way Shulamit insulted her. I start collating my notes in the office. A British Council worker comes in, called George. He is a Christian Arab. \"He is my enemy,\" says Sigal and they both roar with laughter contentedly. Shulamit Aloni rings to ask us both to pardon her for being what she calls \"impatient and obnoxious\". She is worn down, she says, by the weight of her case-work.</p> <p>We set off for the airport. On the way in, I have been advised not to let them stamp my passport so that I can visit Arab countries. But, on the way out, before I can say a word, WHAM, not a second to speak, and the word ISRAEL is on my passport for ever.</p> <p>(At this point the lights shift, and the feel of the stage is changed for the epilogue) Gatwick. My plane is late. I return in the middle of the night. I get on the slow train to Victoria. </p> <p>Darkness. </p> <p>The Israeli military commander, unnamed at his own request, who sits across a desk smiling, telling me that only 20,000 Jews have been killed in the cause of setting up the state. \"Not that every death isn't a tragedy, please don't misunderstand me, and of course I'm not talking about the Jewish experience in Europe. But the Jewish experience in this part of the world? 20,000 to set up a whole country: that's not so bad, you know. Not bad. Not for a whole state.\" Victoria station deserted. Into a friendly black cab. Up past Buckingham Palace, Park Lane, and north towards the suburbs, up the Finchley Road. Leafy street after leafy street of sleeping houses, sleeping bodies, sleeping hearts. Passion receding up the broad tree-lined avenues. Haider Abdel Shafi quoting Mohammed on his return from battle. \"I come back from the little strife and I return to the greater. The strife of the soul.\"</p> <p>Sitting in the harbour with Eran Baniel, eating fish. \"Fuck the land! Fuck it! What does the land matter? The highest value to a Jew is human life. The idea that stones now matter more than lives is a complete deformation of the Jewish religion. A deformation!\"</p> <p>Left on Chapel Street. Tall terraces of impeccable Georgian houses on either side. I think of David Grossman walking on the Heath. \"I have some sort of mineral reaction,\" he said. Pauline, in the boarding house in Gaza: \"There was a point once, there was a reason. You were fighting for a Palestinian state, and you were willing to die. What on earth would you die for now?\"</p> <p>The taxi turns right and right again. Are we where we live, or are we what we think? What matters? Stones or ideas? Stones or ideas?</p> <p>My dog Blanche waking in the night to greet me, the heavy white door of my home closing behind me.</p> <p>Via Dolorosa.</p>",

The hyena never changes his spots.\" I say, this is crazy. Where is the hope? Where is the way forward? \"The only hope now,\" - he sips his coffee - \"is the passage of time. Arafat can never be the solution, because he will always be the problem. For as long as my Arab neighbours go on choosing him, there is no hope whatsoever. \"People know this. They know it but they don't want to face it. They go round saying \"Oh wouldn't it be nice if it all worked out somehow? They know the facts but they refuse to draw the conclusion. It won't work out.\" We are all taken aback by Begin, his intellectual command, his profound and daunting pessimism, and Sigal has gone into one of her silent moods, as if the effort of listening without interrupting has terminally lowered her spirits. I scarcely have time to worry about this. For today I have decided to walk through the mirror into Israel's twin, its underside. Nothing prepares you for the physical shock of the passage into Gaza. One writer has said that driving from Israel into the Gaza Strip is like driving from California into Bangladesh. You become so used to the broad highways, the easy sensuality of Israel that it is the sight of dust, sudden dust, an unholy big brown storm of pure dirt, which alerts you to the fact that you are about to enter a society where people earn precisely 8% of what their opposite numbers earn in Israel. Keith Lawrence and I set off on foot across the concrete strip which divides the two countries. For a moment, it is like a John Le Carre movie, as we carry our bags past gun towers down the wide empty road. And at the exact half-way point, just as in the movies, I am seized, bundled into a waiting car and driven quickly away, admittedly by two friendly young Englishwomen. The reason for this haste, it turns out, is that Susannah and Pauline, my new British Council handlers, have just told me that in 20 minutes I will be meeting with Haider Abdel Shafi. Shafi is the most popular politician in Gaza and it is something of a mystery why he has agreed to see me, since he sees no one. As we travel along a potholed track - you couldn't call it a road - towards the city of Gaza, I am taken aback by what I am seeing. Gaza is an area 45 kilometres by eight. Even now, one-third of it is held by the Israelis, on behalf of just 6,000 religious settlers. Around them are crammed 750,000 Palestinians, half of whom live in the refugee camps, which were temporarily established in 1948. Dusk comes down and we have stepped back 60 years. As we push past the donkeys Pauline says: \"It's a good day today because it's not been raining. When it rains, there's no drainage and the main street can be under three feet of water. Turds float past the car window,\" she says. There are rudiments of civilisation - yellow dustbins, donated by the European Union ; donkeys queue at the 18 sets of traffic lights, donated by the French; and in a bizarre job creation scheme there are innumerable young boys dressed as policemen, and universally ignored. As soon as we are ushered into Haider Abdel Shafi's elegant living room, it becomes clear why he has agreed to meet me. He believes that I am the Guardian journalist, David Hirst, and, as such, the author of a recent two-page expose straplined \"Shameless in Gaza\". Since the 70-year-old Shafi has lately resigned from the legislative body in protest at the notorious corruption of Arafat's regime, he is keen to congratulate me on my work. It seems somehow appropriate to this peculiar, hushed city that a man who knows nothing is now about to interview a man who thinks he is someone else. \"If I want to find excuses for Arafat, then I suppose I can say he has spent his whole life in a liberation movement, and he is unused to not getting his way. Hundreds of millions of dollars have simply disappeared. Arafat is a man who buys peoples' allegiance. But in a society where law is neglected and never enforced, nothing can ever be right.\" I ask what effect the lawlessness is having on the peace process. Shafi smiles. \"There is no peace process. Even by pretending that there is such a thing, we play into Israeli hands. I was in Washington for 20 months negotiating, so I know how Israelis think. Their position has never changed. All they are doing is using settlements to establish their presence in the land, and then to treat it as a fait accompli. It's a strategy, nothing more.\" Shafi gets up to offer us Turkish coffee and chocolates from a big tin of Milk Tray. He twinkles at the ladies, who glow back from the sofa. \"President Clinton has no interest in the indigenous people of Palestine, who were here long before the Israelis arrived. He wants settlement-building to stop. But for him it's not a matter of principle. It's a tactic in his peace process. It's a pause he wants, not a stop.\" How does Arafat feel? \"I have no idea. He refuses to reveal his thinking. Friends say he is depressed. I cannot wonder he is depressed. \"Our most urgent task is to reform ourselves. It's far more important than negotiation with Israel. You can't get anywhere if you live in a society without principles. When Mohammed came back from battle, he said: \"Raja na min al jihadil-asgar ila l-jihadi l-akbar. We come back from the little strife and we return to the bigger strife. The strife of the soul.' But of course nowadays, nobody thinks about these things.\" It is Shafi's achievement to create a calm in us all, and the calm lasts as we step out onto the empty street. I ask: \"Where does Arafat live?\" It's dark and not a soul moves. We drive towards the sea. We turn. A quiet avenue of villas. At the end of this road of seaside vernacular, two enormous tanks. Behind them, Arafat's house, looking like any other. We get out. Silence. Only the roar of the surf, the Mediterranean. \"There'll be a civil war,\" says Pauline. \"It's inevitable. The society is simply not functioning.\" Later, it is Pauline who finally sets me straight. She is here to help the Palestinians set up a civil service. \"What you're seeing, I'm afraid, is the result of the intifada. You have to understand that was a real revolution, and it came up from below, not from the leadership. But now . . . well it's like that film with Meryl Streep. What's it called?\" \"You mean the one where she's meant to be Danish?\" \"No, not that one. The one set during the war.\" \"Oh, Plenty,\" I say, \"I wrote it.\" She looks at me suspiciously. \"Well anyway, the figure of the woman - what's she called?\" \"Susan Traherne.\" \"Yes, the woman who goes to war at 20 and for whom the peace is this terrible disappointment. It's the same here. It's like Plenty. These kids were 13 or 14, some of them even seven or eight, and they found they could create their own structures. They could have a direct and devastating effect on daily life in Israel. By their actions they truly achieved something. But now the energy is gone. The men from Tunis came and stole it. Those same kids have grown up and are sitting around in cafes. They have no jobs, they have no life, they're totally disillusioned. \"There was a point once, there was a reason. You were fighting for a Palestinian state, and you were willing to die. What on earth would you die for now? If you struggled now, you would be arrested, and tortured and put to death, all so that Arafat can go on being corrupt. There are more people in prison today under Arafat than there were under the Israelis! What's the point of dying for a society without rules? If the Israelis were really clever, they would give the Palestinians every inch of land they want, and then stand by and watch them fuck it up.\" This is a terrible analysis, but it's confirmed when I next travel, this time to the Arab city of Ramallah. My official companion is Muna Khlefi, a sparkling, clever Palestinian who thinks I am incredibly lucky to have met Haider Abdel Shafi and who wants to hear every word. \"He is a great man. He is the guts, he is the soul of the country. The new leadership just want to do business. They did business in Lebanon, they did it in Tunis. They say: just make money, then later we'll decide what kind of society we want. But Shafi says you cannot delay this question.\" Muna wants me to meet Albert Aghazerin, the great Palestinian historian, to talk about the problem of Jerusalem. He is late, so I sit in his outer office at Birzeit University, looking out onto the hillside campus. I pick up the Amnesty International report on Palestine. \"Subjects have been electrocuted, hanged upside down. Scalding plastic has been melted over their bodies... \" After an hour, Aghazerin arrives, a frightening figure with a big pipe and a superb sculpted face, rather like the actor Anthony Quinn. He thrusts an article at me, ordering me to read it. When I dare to ask a question, he sighs and says: \"Where do you start? For me you can only answer this by considering the Egyptian conquest of 1831,\" and at once he sets off on a canter through 19th-century statistics which I can't grasp, partly because he scares me so much, and partly because his mind is leaping about like an angry gazelle. However, when I ask him what he thinks the religious Jew truly believes, he starts to cheer up, pleased that we turn out to share a common interest. \"All this apocalyptic stuff only starts after 1967. You do get a whiff of it before but it's only after the six day war that the Jews come up with this new interpretation of the Bible. The building of the Third Temple! The end of the world! Please! It's pure opportunism. Religious revelation which just happens to be the most perfect political connivance. \"There are women in Jerusalem who've actually started sewing the garments for the priests of the Third Temple and they're preparing the unblemished... ANIMAL. You know, what is it? That... what is it? Animal, begins with h? H!\", he shouts. \"Heifer?\" \"That's right! HEIFER! They are preparing the unblemished HEIFER to purge the temple. And of course it all suits Israel fine. But groups like this always bring violence and bloodshed. Rabin's assassination did not come out of nothing.\" I ask him if he thinks Israel divided. \"Deeply, deeply divided. There are three Israels now. The hedonistic Israel of Tel-Aviv. The austere Israel of Jerusalem. And the mad Israel of Hebron which wants only vengeance and blood. \"Look I do not discount what the Jews suffered. Nobody can. I know what they suffered in Europe. But to me it is as if they jumped from a burning building and happened to land and break the neck of a man who was passing. And when the man says 'Hey, you've broken my neck', they say 'Sorry, it's because of the fire'. And when the man says \"yes, but my neck's broken', they just break his arm to try and shut him up. And when he doesn't shut up, they break his other arm. Then his leg. Then his other leg. All in the hope that one day he'll shut up. But, you see, I don't think he will. \"I like these parables. I will give you another. Israel has its hands round our throat. He can't throttle us, but nor can he let us go. He's unhappy because he wants to go for a beer, and we're unhappy because we're being strangled, but in some terrible way we are bound up in each other's unhappiness. We cannot be separated.\" I ask him if it will change. \"It will stink before it changes. You have to ask yourself about the so-called peace process: is its purpose the exchange of land, or is it the subjugation of the Palestinian people? Because, on the ground, there's no question all the evidence points to the second. What is the reason for all these stupid checkpoints, and the impossibility of Arabs getting a visa to visit Jerusalem? Arabs can't visit Jerusalem!\" On the road home to Jerusalem the other night he was stopped, as he always is, at the checkpoint. The army girl who was no older than his own daughter started to go through all his luggage. When she put his things back he said: \"Do you like what you do? I have a daughter, and I will give her the right to do many things, but not this, because this is dehumanising. Do you know what she replied? 'I'm doing a job. I don't think about it. Now goodbye.' \"Shall I sum it up for you? They always ask two questions. Did you pack the bag yourself? And did anyone give you anything to carry? The other day I answered the first question, then I added, 'And no-one gave me anything to carry.' The Israeli guard looked at me furious: 'How dare you? Don't you know : you are not allowed to answer the second question until I ask it?' \"David, that says it all.\" Albert and I part firm friends. And my own spirits are reflected in the cheerful air of Ramallah, the largest Arab city in the West Bank, where women wear dresses and where alcohol is served in the restaurants. On the way to the Presto cafe, where I am to meet the producer of Romeo and Juliet, Muna explains that George Ibrahim is one of the few people in Palestine allowed to make theatre. On arrival, George turns out to be bear-like and convivial, punching my arm whenever he makes a good point. George attacks the portrayal of Arabs in western films. \"We are always just puppets. You play with us according to your imagination, so we are monkeys smoking pipes, or more usually, criminals. I hate Hamas myself, so I know that extremists are criminals. But I also know why. I know why they commit crimes. Think! Just think! Think what depths of despair it will take to make you walk into a market with lumps of dynamite tied round your chest. But no American film-maker has ever tried to think. All Arabs get lumped together.\" His friend, the poet of the intifada, Hussein Barghouti joins in. \"Did you see... did you see The English Patient? Foreground action: white people, noble, fine feelings, strong, full of laughter, walking in gardens, taking showers, oh standing up! Background action: Arabs, shifty, mysterious, dirty, untrustworthy, oh sitting down! Or Air Force One! This picture explains to us what Arabs want. What do they want? To capture the American president! Why? Why would anyone want the American president? Why would they do that? No, really? The reason? Because the world needs an enemy. When the Soviet Union was around, there it was, ready-made. Now it's to be us. It suits the Americans to say, 'Who are the Arabs? The Arabs are the people who will start the third world war.' \"You know, I have been reading Mishima and he is very moving on this subject. The destruction of Japanese culture by the west. The west injecting violence into a culture. All the conflicts in this area are imported. They are not organic. The west came here to find its religion. Yet how did you bring it back to us? In the form of the Crusades! You collect your religion from this part of the world, then you bring it back to us as violence.\" I'm happy in Ramallah, it's less desperate, less disturbing than Gaza, but every night I travel back to Jerusalem, where not only half the world's religions originated but also - hardly by coincidence - where the world first started collecting crime statistics. Yes, Crime Number One. It happened in Jerusalem. Cain killed Abel. At Oslo, the question of how Jerusalem should be administered was put to one side as being simply too difficult even to approach. For this Jerusalem is the world capital of claim and counter-claim, the acknowledged metropolis of dispute. Here, contention, abrasion and mistrust are scored deep into the subtly pink rock. \"The angry face of Yahweh,\" says Arthur Koestler, \"broods over hot rocks which have seen more holy murder, rape and plunder than any other place on earth.\" \"The air over Jerusalem,\" says Herman Melville, \"is saturated with prayers and dreams... it's hard to breathe.\" For me, there's no question: I have to walk the Via Dolorosa, to follow the Stations of the Cross, which represent the steps on Christ's journey to his death. \"All these stones, all this sadness, all this light.\" It's the religion of my homeland, even if homeland's not a word I've ever used. But the shock is to realise just how little impact Christianity has made. It's amusing to see bus-loads of American evangelicals, dressed in shell suits and baseball caps, searching vainly in an old Arab city for any remaining evidence of Our Lord. \"There ought to be more. What's happened? Why is there not more?\" To be honest, I share their bewilderment. After all, Christianity's a well-known religion and I'd say influential in its day. You'd think it was still worth a pilgrimage, but in this town, we come a sporting third. We're the sideshow. The Via Dolorosa is a pavement which winds unimpressively past postcard shops and up narrow alleys, filling me with a sense of loss, with a tangible sense of something lost - until it reaches the Church of the Holy Sepulchre which - wouldn't you know, wouldn't you just guess it? - is also disputed. Yes, even the church which contains the stone where our Lord was crucified is shared unhappily: 70% to the Greeks and the rest doled out higgeldy-piggeldy between the Armenian Christians, the Coptic Christians, the Latins, the Syrians and the Ethiopians. A people divided by a common religion. Sects and the single church. And what's more - hold on, here we go - is the stone on the right spot? Nobody knows. Archaeologists also dispute. Nobody can know because nobody knows where the city walls were. Nobody agrees. Where was Calvary indeed? So for now - look, is anything certain? - let's just do as the family next to me and drop alarmingly to our knees, on the working assumption - let's just assume - X marks the spot, and kiss the stone. After all does the literal truth of it matter? Does the literal truth matter? Aren't we kissing an idea? Stones or ideas? Stones or ideas? And it's a relief, I'd say a relief, to come out of the dark and stroll down to the big open plaza where you find the Wailing Wall, strangely impressive, tall, uncrowded, the bit where the Jews are allowed. For towering above them at the very top of the arrangement, is the most coveted spot in the universe of faith, what the Jews call Temple Mount, but what to the Arabs who occupy it is known as the Haram al-Sharif. And at its centre, the saffron-yellow golden Dome of the Rock. I have felt since I arrived that Jerusalem doesn't need my admiration. Enough people are obsessed with it already. The truth is, I look at it and think how beautiful it must have been when it was a small town. Myself, I would like Jerusalem more if it were less important. But even I, inside the Arab sanctuary, taking in the cleanest, most oxygenated sun-dazzled air you ever breathed, looking across to the Mount of Olives, yield to the splendour of the place and realise: oh I see, how provoking it is to own beauty, to own the most breathtaking space of them all. Coming down, Sigal is waiting. I haven't seen the delightful Sigal for some time, because I have been, as it were, with the other lot, and so she is spilling over with gossip: Netanyahu's government is falling, or is about to fall, or may not fall, because of some scandal about money and loans. I get into the car. The driver doesn't know the city, so we circle for some time. It's interesting. When we stop people in the street to ask them the way to Yad Vashem, the world-famous museum of the Holocaust, some of them don't seem to know. The museum's power is in its very simplicity, a bleak photographic record ending not, as westerners expect, in 1945, but in 1948 at the foundation of the state. At the centre of the display, I stop at the text of Himmler's speech, the most astonishing document of the war, in which he congratulates his men on the discipline they have shown in exerting what he calls their \"moral right\" to exterminate the Jews. It is, Himmler says, \"natural tact\" which prevents any German from speaking of what they are doing. Himmler knows it is hard work, digging pits and throwing bodies into them. But what he is proudest of is that in doing this work his men have - the phrase resonates down the century - his men have \"stayed decent\", and it is staying decent \"that has made us hard\". The only false notes in the museum are hit by works of art. Sculpture and painting. They seem superfluous. In every case the gesture seems inadequate. What is a painting, a painting of a starving man? What is a painting of a corpse? It's the facts we want. Give us the facts. We go into the dark, into the Hall of Names. Here, every Jew who is known to have died between 1939 and 1945 is given a simple file. Finally, after so many years, numbers are given the dignity of becoming human beings. In this sombre room of open shelves, the scale of the Nazi offence, its deliberateness is revealed. The unbroken rank of documentation hits you more shockingly, more woundingly, than any other image. We walk in the Garden of Remembrance. We begin to feel the sun. Voltaire said you must choose between countries where you sweat and countries where you think. The confusing thing about Israel is that it's one where you do both. And my mind is racing now. We're all blind. We all see only what we want to. Don't we blank out the rest? And me more than anyone. At times I'm the worst of the lot. I've seen a good many politicians while I'm here but at the end I'm due to meet one who's lost all hope of office. I'm used to hours getting past the security arrangements for the minister of something or other, but my last visit is to a tiny, unsecured basement in Tel-Aviv. I have already noticed that just the name of Shulamit Aloni is enough to attract violent hostility from some who knew her as the flaming red firebrand of the Rabin government. And as she comes already talking into the room she is like a manic depressive Melina Mercouri with thick glasses and no time to wait for the questions. \"What you want to know?\" she asks, throwing herself down into the biggest armchair. \"Why do you say it's difficult to understand what's happening? It couldn't be simpler. We're going backwards. What's so difficult to understand? Jews were once victims, so we are brainwashed to believe we will always be victims and victims can do no wrong. Suddenly we've become strong and greedy and pretend we can justify everything. We're told all the time the Palestinians want to throw us into the sea. We have six million people and the strongest army in the region. And yet we speak of them as if they were two equal powers. It's just manipulating peoples' fears.\" She raps out an order in Hebrew for Sigal to go and get some coffee. Sigal gets up, furious, while Shulamit carries on, blaming the reversal entirely on Netanyahu. I am enjoying Shulamit - she is absolutely, as they say, my cup of tea - but even I am a little surprised by her blaming Netanyahu for everything. Are things ever really down to one man? \"You are English and I assume you went to high school\" she says, rather nastily, \"so you will have heard of the philosopher Hobbes. Hobbes says a whole society can be destroyed by a single individual who decides to come along and burn down the forest. Netanyahu, aided by the greedy fascists, the army, the security service, is such a man.\" I ask what she can do meanwhile. Does she just wait? \"To wait means to die. I have no optimistic things to tell you. Why come to me? What are you doing here? Go to the younger people and ask them what they think.\" She is staring at me, as if it's the first time she's noticed me at all. \"Why you write down my blah-blah?\" I say that I normally start an interview by explaining what I am doing here, but somehow we had skipped that stage. \"It's a bad time. What can I say?\" \"It's what you feel.\" \"No, it's not what I feel. It's what I know. If it were only what I feel I'd go and have a brandy and I'd feel better. I'm not telling you my mood, though my mood is bad. I'm telling you the facts. I am gloomy. But what do I matter?\" She looks me in the eye, challenging me to defy her. This talented lawyer, who has done as much as anyone to offer practical support to the victims of discrimination and segregation, is lost, in pain, painfully lost and spoiling for a fight. \"What do you see happening next?\" \"Demonstrations, bloodshed, bitterness. It's not yet a civil war, but it's a form of civil war. It's a Kulturkampf. Do you know what that is?\" I nod. \"We are in the middle of one. The great mistake was to give power to the clergy in the first place. And immigrants came from eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, they were backward, they knew nothing about democracy. They think democracy is the rule by the majority. What's worst, we have no written constitution...\" I have not opened my mouth and already she is shouting at me. \"Don't tell me you don't have one in England! I know that! I know that! But you have the Magna Carta and Oliver Cromwell and a tradition, and until recently you had the idea that certain things are not done.\" She gets up. It ends as abruptly as it begins. \"Anything else? I have to run.\" I am aware this woman's world was destroyed by Rabin's death. She shakes my hand. \"The British caused a lot of problems here.\" \"I know that\". \"Do you know what I say to the British? Since you left, we love you very much. And I mean it. We do.\" We walk back to the British Council, Sigal fuming at the way Shulamit insulted her. I start collating my notes in the office. A British Council worker comes in, called George. He is a Christian Arab. \"He is my enemy,\" says Sigal and they both roar with laughter contentedly. Shulamit Aloni rings to ask us both to pardon her for being what she calls \"impatient and obnoxious\". She is worn down, she says, by the weight of her case-work. We set off for the airport. On the way in, I have been advised not to let them stamp my passport so that I can visit Arab countries. But, on the way out, before I can say a word, WHAM, not a second to speak, and the word ISRAEL is on my passport for ever. (At this point the lights shift, and the feel of the stage is changed for the epilogue) Gatwick. My plane is late. I return in the middle of the night. I get on the slow train to Victoria. Darkness. The Israeli military commander, unnamed at his own request, who sits across a desk smiling, telling me that only 20,000 Jews have been killed in the cause of setting up the state. \"Not that every death isn't a tragedy, please don't misunderstand me, and of course I'm not talking about the Jewish experience in Europe. But the Jewish experience in this part of the world? 20,000 to set up a whole country: that's not so bad, you know. Not bad. Not for a whole state.\" Victoria station deserted. Into a friendly black cab. Up past Buckingham Palace, Park Lane, and north towards the suburbs, up the Finchley Road. Leafy street after leafy street of sleeping houses, sleeping bodies, sleeping hearts. Passion receding up the broad tree-lined avenues. Haider Abdel Shafi quoting Mohammed on his return from battle. \"I come back from the little strife and I return to the greater. The strife of the soul.\" Sitting in the harbour with Eran Baniel, eating fish. \"Fuck the land! Fuck it! What does the land matter? The highest value to a Jew is human life. The idea that stones now matter more than lives is a complete deformation of the Jewish religion. A deformation!\" Left on Chapel Street. Tall terraces of impeccable Georgian houses on either side. I think of David Grossman walking on the Heath. \"I have some sort of mineral reaction,\" he said. Pauline, in the boarding house in Gaza: \"There was a point once, there was a reason. You were fighting for a Palestinian state, and you were willing to die. What on earth would you die for now?\" The taxi turns right and right again. Are we where we live, or are we what we think? What matters? Stones or ideas? Stones or ideas? My dog Blanche waking in the night to greet me, the heavy white door of my home closing behind me. Via Dolorosa.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p> <p>On a Saturday in late September earlier this year, I stood once more on the Mount of Olives, looking across to the divided city of Jerusalem. It was the first time I'd been back since I'd made a series of visits to write Via Dolorosa three years previously. This time, the occasion was particularly happy. A friend was getting married, and by some special good fortune, the ceremony was allowed to take place in the open air, in an amphitheatre at the Hebrew University, on the very spot where the state of Israel was declared in 1948. Afterwards 350 guests piled into buses and were driven out into the desert. There followed an evening of Gatsby-like munificence - belly-dancers, camels and carpets on the sand. The speeches stressed the importance of family, roots, belonging. Already, it seems an extraordinarily long time ago. I can't pretend that at the wedding I had any inkling of the imminence of the convulsions which have since shaken the area, and which seem to have begun noticeably to shift the attitudes of foreigners to the rights and wrongs of the struggle between Israelis and Palestinians. The television pictures of heavily armed Israeli soldiers firing, as it seems, indiscriminately at young Palestinians who carry only rocks and bottles have ignited the emotions of a far wider public than anyone would hitherto have imagined. </p> <p> Curiously, I had begun writing my play in 1997, with the strong conviction that it was unhealthy that such a violent dispute should attract the passionate interest only of its own participants. At the time the west was shrugging off the subject of Arab and Jew as if it were over-familiar and boring. I could never have foreseen how, three years later, I would hear people who had previously been non-partisan arguing with such a deep sense of moral disgust and revulsion against the imbalance of forces at play in the territory. The arithmetic tells its own story: at least 130 people dead as I write this, all but eight of them Arab. When Elyse Dodgson, the head of the Royal Court's international department which had originally sent me to the Middle East, rang a friend in Ramallah to ask her what people were now feeling, the friend replied: \"We're not feeling anything. We're just burying the dead.\" </p> <p>It had seemed important when writing the play not to waste time offering opinions, since here was a controversy already overloaded with opinion. It was far more valuable to attempt enlightenment. I wanted, above all, to explain the roots of some of the powerful feelings which informed the attitudes of those most concerned. But by chance, four weeks ago in Jerusalem, I did make a point of returning to Yad Vashem, the Museum of the Holocaust, precisely because I wanted to remind myself out of what terrible suffering the current dilemmas of the area had come. I had always found the museum deeply moving and affecting. This time, as we walked in, we were faced with a few hundred Israeli conscripts who had plainly been made to visit the museum as part of their national service. Against black-and-white photographs of men, women and children dying in concentration camps, the young soldiers stood in uniform, boots and dark glasses, chewing gum, making obscene jokes and chatting loudly on mobile phones. Around their necks were still slung their sleek, black sub-machine guns, which they had not considered to remove before entering the museum. It was an image of stunning arrogance and disrespect. Even to someone who had gone out of his way not to rush to easy judgment, it marked confirmation of what the play had intimated - that sometimes the divisions inside the two communities have been just as important as the divisions between them. </p> <p> Watching the events of the last few weeks, I have become convinced that one statistic from Via Dolorosa stands out above all others. Arabs who live and work in the Palestinian territory earn well under one-tenth of what their opposite numbers earn in Israel. Wherever the blame lies for this dismal state of affairs - and both sides, remember, have failed the ordinary Palestinian whether by occupation or corruption - it must nevertheless be apparent to all parties that there is no chance of addressing profound problems of geography and religion if you do not also help correct this grotesque inequality. Crazy kids pick up stones not only because they believe their land has been stolen, but also because they feel that, in the current dispensation, there is no prospect of a livelihood. In looking for causes of the recent violence, it suits everybody to disregard the economic. But people with nothing to lose lose nothing by fighting. During the year I performed the play both here and in New York, I was asked over and over why I was so involved in a region in which the death rate, after all, was nowhere near as frighteningly high as it was in Rwanda. History, I believe, is answering that question, and not in ways which are offering much comfort.</p> <p><strong>Via Dolorosa revisited</strong> </p> <p>Via Dolorosa is a monologue, ideally to be performed by its author. As the audience arrive, the author is at the side of the stage. When they are all in he begins to speak. <br> People always say that in the west we lead shallow lives. Our lives must be shallow because we live in countries where nobody believes in anything any more. All my life, I've been told \"Western civilisation? An old bitch gone in the teeth.\" And so people say, go to Israel. Because in Israel at least people are fighting. </p> <p>In Israel, they're fighting for something they believe in. Israel is, first and foremost, a cause, the cause being a patch of land, north to south on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean, lying like a small brown anchovy set down on a school atlas, to which the most persecuted people of modern times - perhaps the most persecuted people of all times - after the matchless catastrophe of the Holocaust rushed in the perfectly reasonable belief that they would never be safe until they had a country of their own. \"We appealed to the conscience of the world. The world has no conscience. We have no one but ourselves.\" The fight. The struggle. The historic destiny. The return of the people. The cause: life therefore having a meaning and shape that eludes the rest of us in the endless wash of \"What the hell are we doing here?\" In a single day, says an Israeli friend, he experiences events and emotions that would keep a Swede going for a year. </p> <p> Zionism being a movement with only a short history, and distinguished from other political movements of our time by the fact that it was invented by a playwright. Yes, Theodor Herzl, in 1894 takes a mere three weeks to write his play Das Neue Ghetto, in which the Jewish hero, struck down by his enemy, dies at curtain-fall, his last words ringing out through the darkened theatre: \"I want to get out! Out of the ghetto!\" Nine years later it is the same Herzl who is chairman of the World Zionist Congress when Lord Lansdowne, on behalf of the magnanimous British Empire, is generous enough to offer a small chunk of Uganda as a suitable place for the Jews to \"live and observe their national customs\". Incredibly, a fair number of delegates are hotly in favour - a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, and Africa, after all, is better than nothing - but the option is finally rejected on the grounds that Uganda does not have the spiritual quality the Jews require. From this moment on, the central argument is foreshadowed. Is this a Biblical mission? Or is Israel to be a secular state? Throughout the 80s, organizations like the Friends of Israel offer to pay for writers to visit their country. Later, my friend Philip Roth goes off his own bat and returns home inspired by his meeting with the settlers, those religious Jews who have turned their whole lives into an act of political defiance by establishing Jewish townships on hitherto Arab land. \"You've got to go, David. You've got to go and see it for yourself. These people are absolute lunatics. They're the maddest people I've ever met in my life. For any writer of fiction, they're the most wonderful material.\" \"But surely,\" I say to Philip, one of America's most gifted comic novelists, \"they're your material, not mine.\" \"Oh no,\" says Philip, \"You have no idea. These people are so crazy there's room enough for all of us.\" </p> <p> On all occasions I refuse. It is only now, it is only 10 years later that I realise, almost without noticing, that for some time my subject as a playwright has been faith. My subject is belief. And so it comes to seem appropriate - no, more than that, it comes to seem urgent - that the 50-year-old British playwright should finally visit the 50-year-old state. The week before, the Israeli novelist, David Grossman, comes to my house in Hampstead. He says that whenever he comes to London, he makes sure to walk on Hampstead Heath. \"I have some sort of mineral reaction to the place I don't get anywhere else in the world. Just to breathe the air makes me feel happy.\" Obscurely, I feel proud when he says this, as if somehow Grossman's happiness in Hampstead reflected credit on me, as if it were part of the glory of happening to be British to be able, rather casually, to offer foreigners the wonderfulness of Hampstead Heath. But \"mineral reaction\"? Grossman has thought so deeply about the problems of Israel and has lived so long with questions from people like me that he can't help wincing at my clumsiness. \"What you call the major problems of Israel can one day be solved. There will be a Palestinian state. When I said this 10 years ago, everyone told me I was crazy. But now in their hearts people know it will happen. There are huge issues. But they are essentially soluble. What is less soluble is the underlying moral question: how does a majority which itself has been historically unloved now deal fairly with an unloved Palestinian minority in their own midst? Are we mature enough, are we courageous enough to internalise the idea of equality?\" I say, surely this has always been the problem at the heart of Zionism. Israel is effectively a religious state. It now admits immigrants of only one faith. Won't it one day have to become a modern country, multi-cultural, like any other? </p> <p> Grossman smiles. \"Yes, but for us that's very difficult. I don't see it the way you do. I don't think you have to be religious to be a Jew. There is no God in my life, and I'm as Jewish as it's possible to be. If you want to understand Israel, look to the six day war. That war changed everything. Myself, I feel we were much more Jewish before 1967. That war destroyed our essential Jewishness, because up till then places and buildings and stones didn't mean anything to us. They weren't important. What mattered to us were ideas. </p> <p> \"Something very profound happened to Israel during the six day war. For the first time we seized land, we took land by conquest, and suddenly the religious Jew saw the Bible not as a historical story, but as a contemporary operations manual. Yes, I want Israelis to have access to the Wailing Wall, but I don't need to own it. Nor do I need to own any of these holy places. It's new this idea. That you have to own things. It's new and it's profoundly un-Jewish.\" On arrival in Tel-Aviv I am rushed down Californian highways in the company of Sigal Cohen, the young and humorous translator who will accompany me wherever I go. I had expected massive security precautions and I boast of the ease with which I have sailed through immigration. \"Yes,\" she says, \"Israel is a very easy country to get into but it's an impossible country to get out of.\" At my nasty western-style downtown hotel, my chief British Council host Keith Lawrence is waiting. He is very thin, like a teddy-boy with tapered trousers and a collarless jacket. Give him a tall, skinny latte and this could be Soho. He is the man who is bringing plays like Shopping and Fucking to Tel-Aviv. He keeps saying Tel-Aviv is sexy and a happening kind of place, especially for a beach bunny, and sometimes he refers, rather unexpectedly, to the 'buzz'. When I try to find out exactly what the buzz consists of, everyone tells me that it has mostly to do with sitting in cafes and fucking. Later somebody tells me that Tel-Aviv is the fucking capital of the world. </p> <p> No chance to observe, because I am off to eat baked sea-bream, in a stunning waterside restaurant in the nearby port of Jaffa, at the invitation of the Israeli theatre director Eran Baniel. Eran is a fine-looking man in his early 50s, bearded, articulate, in a black corduroy suit. Now we drink Rothschild's Red Merlot and discuss the profound divisions which have emerged between the secular and religious ways of life. At the foundation of the state, the religious orthodox were guaranteed a special status. Anyone who entered a yeshiva to study the Talmud was exempted from the army, and given a public salary. At the time, there were just 500 students, but by the early 1990s there were over 100,000, says Eran \"effectively living off the state for life\".</p> <p> \"For years,\" says Eran, \"the Jew believed that when the goy persecuted you, it gave you the right to shortchange him. Hence the racial stereotype of the Jew who smiles while he swindles you. Well now we are the goy. Israel is the goy. And the religious orthodox have become the thieving Jew. They go to whoever wants to be prime minister and say, yes, you can have our votes but only if you promise to give us our money. They don't serve in the army. They smile and smile, and rob the country blind.\" </p> <p>Eran, it is clear, is a secular Jew. His life was changed by his famous co-production of Romeo and Juliet. This was presented in the middle of Jerusalem. The Palestinians played the Capulets and the Jews played the Montagues. There were five months of rehearsal, with the Palestinian producer George Ibrahim in charge of the Capulets and with Eran directing the Montagues. The project took eight years to achieve. In this production the Capulets really hated the Montagues. This was not a production about love, but about hate. Neither side needed the rhetoric at the beginning. \"You know that bit,\" says Eran, \"where the two sides line up and sort of say \"Fuck you, Montague\" and \"Fuck you, Capulet\". Well, we cut all that. Because Israelis and Palestinians go straight to the emotion: you pick up a stone and throw it straight away.\" </p> <p> Eran says he never really understood the occupation until he did this job. \"Most Israelis,\" says Eran, \"don't even notice the Palestinians. They don't see them. Have you seen how Israelis drive? They don't drive. They own the road.\" His voice is rising now. \"Have you been to the Palestinian territories? Look how the water is allocated. In the settlements, you have the obscene spectacle of Israelis sitting by their swimming pools while Palestinians carry their drinking water round in jerry cans.\" He uses a phrase I have heard before. \"It's un-Jewish, it's un-Jewish behaviour.\" By chance, a play of mine, Amy's View, is currently rehearsing at the Cameri, one of Israel's foremost theatres. Next morning I kick my way through the litter-strewn streets to meet the cast, who have two hours of questions. At one point I say the play is about how we no longer expect society to validate our beliefs. Our only values are private values. The last line of the play is: \"So. We're alone.\" Israel, I say, may be the worst place in the world to perform the play since here people are still arguing passionately about where their country is heading. Whereas in England Tony Blair represents all things to all men. What does he believe? Nobody knows. What will he do? Whatever is popular. Where is he heading? He never tells us. At once, an Israeli actor interrupts: \"Oh please, please, send us your Tony Blair.\" </p> <p> In fact, theatre is making me impatient because I am longing to get going and spend Sabbath in the Jewish settlement of Sheri Tikva which lies some miles inside the borders of the Palestinian territory. It takes us hours to push our way out of town on a Friday afternoon, in the pre-Sabbath rush, but finally Tel-Aviv falls away, and the road opens out. I think of my Sunday school, Sunday afternoons in a stuffy wooden hall in Bexhill-on-Sea. I look from the window of the car and the pale, stony landscape of dusty hills and olive-groves feels familiar, like a drawing from memory. </p> <p>I have now to be careful, because 10 minutes later a feeling arrives, unbidden. My mind is slipping, I am dreaming, perhaps of Israeli wine and fresh fish, when suddenly, in open country at last, it occurs to me, as I look out the window, that the Jews do not belong here. This thought is so unexpected and of course implicitly so inflammatory that I turn guiltily, blushing, to see whether anyone in the back of the car can tell what I'm thinking. Up till now I have spent time in Tel-Aviv, a town which, on its surface at least, is sophisticated and western, but now I am speeding through a huge land mass - I feel the topography, I feel the land, a great hot continent stretching away to my right, Arab country after Arab country - and for the first time I understand how odd, how egregious Israel must look to the Arab eye. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,390205,00.html\">Extract two</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Introduction On a Saturday in late September earlier this year, I stood once more on the Mount of Olives, looking across to the divided city of Jerusalem. It was the first time I'd been back since I'd made a series of visits to write Via Dolorosa three years previously. This time, the occasion was particularly happy. A friend was getting married, and by some special good fortune, the ceremony was allowed to take place in the open air, in an amphitheatre at the Hebrew University, on the very spot where the state of Israel was declared in 1948. Afterwards 350 guests piled into buses and were driven out into the desert. There followed an evening of Gatsby-like munificence - belly-dancers, camels and carpets on the sand. The speeches stressed the importance of family, roots, belonging. Already, it seems an extraordinarily long time ago. I can't pretend that at the wedding I had any inkling of the imminence of the convulsions which have since shaken the area, and which seem to have begun noticeably to shift the attitudes of foreigners to the rights and wrongs of the struggle between Israelis and Palestinians. The television pictures of heavily armed Israeli soldiers firing, as it seems, indiscriminately at young Palestinians who carry only rocks and bottles have ignited the emotions of a far wider public than anyone would hitherto have imagined. Curiously, I had begun writing my play in 1997, with the strong conviction that it was unhealthy that such a violent dispute should attract the passionate interest only of its own participants. At the time the west was shrugging off the subject of Arab and Jew as if it were over-familiar and boring. I could never have foreseen how, three years later, I would hear people who had previously been non-partisan arguing with such a deep sense of moral disgust and revulsion against the imbalance of forces at play in the territory. The arithmetic tells its own story: at least 130 people dead as I write this, all but eight of them Arab. When Elyse Dodgson, the head of the Royal Court's international department which had originally sent me to the Middle East, rang a friend in Ramallah to ask her what people were now feeling, the friend replied: \"We're not feeling anything. We're just burying the dead.\" It had seemed important when writing the play not to waste time offering opinions, since here was a controversy already overloaded with opinion. It was far more valuable to attempt enlightenment. I wanted, above all, to explain the roots of some of the powerful feelings which informed the attitudes of those most concerned. But by chance, four weeks ago in Jerusalem, I did make a point of returning to Yad Vashem, the Museum of the Holocaust, precisely because I wanted to remind myself out of what terrible suffering the current dilemmas of the area had come. I had always found the museum deeply moving and affecting. This time, as we walked in, we were faced with a few hundred Israeli conscripts who had plainly been made to visit the museum as part of their national service. Against black-and-white photographs of men, women and children dying in concentration camps, the young soldiers stood in uniform, boots and dark glasses, chewing gum, making obscene jokes and chatting loudly on mobile phones. Around their necks were still slung their sleek, black sub-machine guns, which they had not considered to remove before entering the museum. It was an image of stunning arrogance and disrespect. Even to someone who had gone out of his way not to rush to easy judgment, it marked confirmation of what the play had intimated - that sometimes the divisions inside the two communities have been just as important as the divisions between them. Watching the events of the last few weeks, I have become convinced that one statistic from Via Dolorosa stands out above all others. Arabs who live and work in the Palestinian territory earn well under one-tenth of what their opposite numbers earn in Israel. Wherever the blame lies for this dismal state of affairs - and both sides, remember, have failed the ordinary Palestinian whether by occupation or corruption - it must nevertheless be apparent to all parties that there is no chance of addressing profound problems of geography and religion if you do not also help correct this grotesque inequality. Crazy kids pick up stones not only because they believe their land has been stolen, but also because they feel that, in the current dispensation, there is no prospect of a livelihood. In looking for causes of the recent violence, it suits everybody to disregard the economic. But people with nothing to lose lose nothing by fighting. During the year I performed the play both here and in New York, I was asked over and over why I was so involved in a region in which the death rate, after all, was nowhere near as frighteningly high as it was in Rwanda. History, I believe, is answering that question, and not in ways which are offering much comfort. Via Dolorosa revisited Via Dolorosa is a monologue, ideally to be performed by its author. As the audience arrive, the author is at the side of the stage. When they are all in he begins to speak. People always say that in the west we lead shallow lives. Our lives must be shallow because we live in countries where nobody believes in anything any more. All my life, I've been told \"Western civilisation?

The world has no conscience. We have no one but ourselves.\" The fight. The struggle. The historic destiny. The return of the people. The cause: life therefore having a meaning and shape that eludes the rest of us in the endless wash of \"What the hell are we doing here?\" In a single day, says an Israeli friend, he experiences events and emotions that would keep a Swede going for a year. Zionism being a movement with only a short history, and distinguished from other political movements of our time by the fact that it was invented by a playwright.

Though I'd like her more if she didn't now go on to say that Peres was way offline, the Labour party was corrupt, and Ben Gurion was a well-known communist. And a worse thing happens when we get home. She asks me if I'm married and have children. I explain that my wife is Jewish. Her family fled from Turkey. Her mother and father hid from the Nazis for a year in a barn in France. My wife has taken the exact opposite course to their own. Not only has she married a Gentile, but one cousin has married a black man. Another cousin lives with an Arab. \"And what's funny is the Jewish family's fine about it,\" I say, laughing. \"It's the Arab girl who doesn't dare tell hers!\"</p> <p>I feel Sarah withdraw from me. Up till this, I have been an observer. Now I am the husband of an assimilationist. \"So what you're saying is there won't be any Jews in the next generation,\" she says. \"Tell your wife, maybe she feels accepted. But tell her to remember: to be accepted, you don't have to be the same.\"</p> <p>I've reached a low point, it's obvious, and next morning I'm not crazy to get up from my bedroom with its bomb-proof steel door to resume what seems to me a subtly insane dialogue. Nothing wrong with the philosophy This Is How We Want to Live, so long as you don't attach the lethal dangler: This Is How We Want To Live, So Fuck You.</p> <p>But luckily my mood is not infectious, because at noon we are bowling downhill to spend time with Miriam's family who are already ranged round the kitchen table eating a delicious-looking stew. Various American presidents are discussed, including Nixon, who, everyone says, was not a good person. \"But he saved Israel's ass, so he's fine by me.\" Danny explains that although Nixon called Kissinger the Jew-boy and spoke of people as kikes, he was not a real anti-Semite, because he was equally rude about all other races, like Ities and Micks. \"He was anti-Semitic, but he wasn't really.\"</p> <p>The news that I am scheduled to meet Menachem Begin's famous son Benni leads us back to the subject of Rabin and his wife Leah (\"Ugly, a very ugly woman to look at,\" says someone, getting in an early blow) and what he knew of his own assassination. Suddenly, the atmosphere turns quite nasty. Miriam's elderly husband, Ron, is shouting that everyone knows that the assassin was put up to it by a government agent provocateur. The whole assassination was a plot to discredit the right wing and the settlers. Sarah is becoming equally voluble. \"Ron, Ron you don't have to twist the facts. I happen to agree with your theory, but it isn't yet proved.\" But Ron is now raving about how you can*t trust anybody, there are agents everywhere, so Danny tactfully suggests we leave. In the street afterwards Danny tells his wife to calm down. \"Just be calm, just be calm when you talk.\"</p> <p>But I have learned something important. Nothing unsettles the settlers more than the idea that Rabin's death is their fault. The murder of a Jewish leader by a Jew travesties the very meaning of their existence. </p> <p>Meanwhile, at my side, Sarah is not letting go. \"David, you have to understand Rabin was not a man from a good home, and he was unfaithful to his wife Leah, though of course the press don't tell you that...\" To be honest, by now, I'm tiring a bit - my ignorance and dismay make an unhappy cocktail - and at lunch I try to avoid trigger words like \"Rabin\" or \"Bible\". But after lunch, we bench. One of their daughters explicates a portion of Biblical text. She tells the basic story - something about a patriarch going somewhere to get a wife - and then she introduces the character of a girl aged either three or 14. No two rabbis, she says, have ever agreed on the girl's age. </p> <p>At once an argument starts up. Sarah says the girl can't possibly have been three because later in the story she has to water 10 camels. \"Have you ever tried to water a camel? The buckets are really heavy and each camel needs at least four buckets. How can a three-year-old do that?\" Another daughter is rolling her eyes to the ceiling - she's the irreligious one - and one of the sons is shouting that the girl is meant to have had children: \"Are you telling me she had kids at the age of three?\"</p> <p>Suddenly the whole table is yelling and I am sitting there wondering - wondering in the sense of marvelling - that it never occurs to anyone here that maybe the story is simply wrong, maybe the storyteller just got it WRONG, but no, it's the Bible, so it must be true and it must be our fault if we don't get it and so we sit here - can we please stop SHOUTING for a moment? - arguing about whether a girl of three can, or cannot, carry 40 buckets to water her camels. Who speaks for the settlers better than the brilliant Benni Begin? A few days later, he is waiting, on time, on schedule, at the Knesset in Jerusalem. When I start by asking him a question about Netanyahu, he is steely. \"This is not what you're here to talk about. You are here to talk about the British Mandate.\" He gets out a personal organizer, and jabs angrily at the key-pads. \"Look. David Hare: 2.15. Mandate.\"</p> <p>I swallow hard and say that the British period of rule does indeed attract me, at one stage I had wanted to research it, but that - how do I put this? - I'm a writer. I can't always predict my own interests. And my interests have deepened. Begin is still scowling. He is a slight man, with a manner which somehow seems both modest and confrontational at the same time. His eyes are black as caviar. \"It's a family quarrel and I don't talk about family in front of strangers.\" I say it would help if he could explain why these conquered places mean so much to him. Why does the Oslo accord cause him such deep offence?</p> <p>Begin looks at me. He says he will answer by explaining that he has been trying to solve the problem of a notoriously difficult ancient Hebrew message on a stone from the time of the destruction of the First Temple in 587 BC. What has interested him is how instantly familiar the stone seemed. \"It was in the language of the Book of Kings and of Samuel. The prose was a little higher than the prose I use every day, yet I felt very comfortable with it. When it said harvest, I could see the harvest. I knew the weather. I knew the smells and the seasons. I had read books about this stone, but no stranger had ever brought it close to me. The closeness I felt was a revelation.</p> <p>\"So you see, David, what you call the emotion of these places is, to me, the very history of our people. In these places, we feel this is Israel, this is us. Most of what matters in Jewish history happened within 20 miles of Jerusalem. We can identify rocks where David fought against the Philistines. The exact place where Amos preached. It is inconceivable to be deprived of our right to live here and walk here; to be where our kings ruled and our judges judged; and, most important of all, to walk the hillsides where our prophets prophesied. This is ours because this is us. We're crippled without it.\"</p> <p>I say I understand this - this yearning, this 2,000-year spiritual yearning to go home - but that my time in the settlements has disturbed me. I have met people who are choosing danger, who choose to put themselves in a place of danger, and yet who refuse to negotiate themselves out of that danger. Isn't this a form of madness, to live with no conception of the future? \"If you mean will we give up land? then no. I have always warned, \"Give up the land and you will not get peace. You will get insecurity.\" People used to say, well it's a gamble worth taking. And now they see the results. Two hundred and sixty people killed since Oslo, thousands injured and all because we made an accommodation with an alliance of hoodlums and terrorists. The more land you give away, the more terrorism there is. Every hectare conceded to PLO/Islamic Jihad becomes a haven of immunity. What we have to confront is the ominous possibility of encouraging a terrorist state right next door to us.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/extracts/story/0,6761,390208,00.html\">Extract three</a></p>",

They stride on pretty well regardless of their surroundings, or just head for the nearest seat. They are enjoying themselves in their own way. </p> <p>Curiosity generally spurs me to take a good preliminary squint at my surroundings. Is the house visible and, if so, is it beautiful or hideous? If beautiful, do its surroundings set it off pleasantly? If hideous, how well have the owners managed to conceal the fact? Or perhaps they don't want to, and actually enjoy the very features that I find awful. That in itself can be fun. Especially if you're with a friend whom you can dig in the ribs and have a good laugh with. </p> <p>Is the garden stuffed with features? Features, especially water features, are the in thing currently. My own garden's lack of piddling water spouts, of fountains or of rushing torrents seems to constitute a sad omission in the eyes of some, and they often comment on it. Personally, I hate to be fidgeted by features. The bones of a garden are quite another matter. Frills are easily overdone. </p> <p>What part are trees playing in the garden you are in? Often they fail to be noticed, yet their role is vital. Also, they are not static but always changing, both with the seasons and with the years. They may develop in ways that the owners had not premeditated, and with so much of their own character that their individuality seems worth accommodating. Or they may simply become gaga and an eyesore, yet be hung on to out of familiarity or inertia, waiting for the next big storm to make a messy necessity of removal. </p> <p>Often, you may, as a visitor, be close to, yet fail to notice, a fine specimen of a tree because it is way above your usual sight lines. The kind of tree that I greatly enjoy in an old, long-established garden is an ancient robinia - the false acacia. They become craggy, with deeply fissured trunks; the branches may be quite sparse and leaves scarcely yet apparent as late as early June. Then, giving themselves a shake, there they suddenly are, hung with tresses of white, dark-centred blossom, scenting the air around them. It is an extraordinary transformation and their leaves thereafter are of the airiest. Yet this may be decried as a tiresome tree, liable to sucker and with unpleasantly thorny branches that are prone to dropping off. For the care of anything alive, however, there are always penalties to pay. As visitors, we can applaud the owners' forbearance. </p> <p>Small trees can develop as much personality as big. At Dixter, my home, we have consistently failed to please the walnut, Juglans regia . It is not really difficult; perhaps our soil is too clayey or insufficiently drained. The outstanding feature about a walnut, apart from its pleasing, rounded crown, is its pale bark, which stands out particularly in winter. </p> <p>Fig trees, similarly, have very pale grey bark, which makes them a beautiful winter feature when trained into a wall. But a free-standing fig bush-tree, with many stems, looks wonderful - witness the one standing at one end of the footbridge across the lake in St James's Park in London. That, after a big storm, was stooled to the ground, yet figs take to this treatment as though expecting it. They bounce back with amazing speed and vigour. Of course, a bush-tree of this sort does need a good deal of lateral space, a point that many gardeners fail to appreciate when first planting their gardens.

A fig tree should immediately draw your attention when you catch sight of it in a garden.

      "body": "<p>Thirty years ago it was the telephone and the telly. Not everyone had them, and your parents will tell you (if you're fool enough to encourage them) how they had to go to a friend's house if they wanted to access these new technologies. </p> <p>Now it's the web, and many of today's generation are in the same position. For graduates however, the internet is more than just the latest nice-to-have. </p> <p>If you're interested in pursuing your intellectual interests or simply looking for a job (and some companies now only accept applications online), the internet has become an essential resource. </p> <p>So if you're not online at home, what options do you have, and how much do they cost? </p> <p> <strong> 1. Friends and family</strong> </p> <p> Although they are your first resort, the difficulty with friends and family is that, unlike the telly or a quick loan of the phone, using this technology is both solitary and time-consuming. Because of this anti-social element, the generosity of friends and family can turn quickly to resentment. This option does of course have the advantage of being free, but you may pay the price in strained relationships. </p> <p> <strong> 2. The private sector</strong> </p> <p> From the invention of insurance through to the jukebox, caf\u00e9s have been quick to provide a semi-public space in which the latest innovation can be accessed. The internet revolution has been no different. Internet caf\u00e9s offer access to the web at prices from \u00a32 to \u00a34 an hour. </p> <p>The only difficulty is that you need to be able to work without being distracted by the ebb and flow of those around you, and, as everyone who has used the net knows, the chargeable minutes tick by quickly. </p> <p> <strong> 3. The public sector</strong> </p> <p> Unfortunately, provision of internet facilities at public libraries is not yet universal, nor is it necessarily free. At present, just over a fifth of local authorities have internet access at all their libraries while nearly 90% have it in at least one of their sites. </p> <p>When it comes to charging, you can expect to pay as much as you would at an internet cafe, though 20% of local authorities do now offer free access from at least one of their libraries. </p> <p>If you want to use a public library it is necessary to be a member. It is also worth phoning because you will probably need to book in advance. The major drawback is that you will almost certainly find your time is limited (e.g. to an hour a day). </p> <p> <strong> 4.University libraries</strong> </p> <p> Thirty years ago you could don a corduroy jacket adopt a plausibly academic air and talk your way into any university library, but times have changed. Once you stop being a student the chances of finding free internet access at a university library diminishes significantly. Libraries now charge non-student members up to several hundred pounds a year, and though there may be preferential rates for alumnae, this is not much help if you have moved away from the area. </p> <p>The only thing to do is telephone and ask (both your alma mater and others have reciprocal arrangements). Some of the post-1992 universities do see themselves as providing a service to the wider community, so they might be a good starting point. </p> <p>If your use of the internet is limited to searching for a job, free or very cheap access should be a lot easier to find. </p> <p> <strong> 5. Careers services</strong> </p> <p> The rule of thumb is that any university careers service will provide graduates of other universities with help (including internet access) for up to three years after graduation. Some careers services do charge (more likely in the bigger cities), but fees tend to be reasonable. The University of Bristol for example charges a one-off fee of \u00a314 (\u00a37 to the unemployed) to alumnae of other universities. </p> <p> <strong> 6. Job centres</strong> </p> <p> One advantage of being unemployed is that after six months of claiming benefit you become eligible for the New Deal. Along with all the free stamps, word processing and printing facilities which this scheme offers, the organisations which deliver it should also be able to arrange free internet access. </p> <p>Whatever option you use, one thing is certain, this situation is not going to last for long. This means that in 30 years' time you can fascinate your own children with your stories of how they used to hire out the net by the hour.</p>",

The public sector Unfortunately, provision of internet facilities at public libraries is not yet universal, nor is it necessarily free. At present, just over a fifth of local authorities have internet access at all their libraries while nearly 90% have it in at least one of their sites. When it comes to charging, you can expect to pay as much as you would at an internet cafe, though 20% of local authorities do now offer free access from at least one of their libraries. If you want to use a public library it is necessary to be a member. It is also worth phoning because you will probably need to book in advance. The major drawback is that you will almost certainly find your time is limited (e.g. to an hour a day). 4.University libraries Thirty years ago you could don a corduroy jacket adopt a plausibly academic air and talk your way into any university library, but times have changed. Once you stop being a student the chances of finding free internet access at a university library diminishes significantly. Libraries now charge non-student members up to several hundred pounds a year, and though there may be preferential rates for alumnae, this is not much help if you have moved away from the area. The only thing to do is telephone and ask (both your alma mater and others have reciprocal arrangements). Some of the post-1992 universities do see themselves as providing a service to the wider community, so they might be a good starting point. If your use of the internet is limited to searching for a job, free or very cheap access should be a lot easier to find. 5. Careers services The rule of thumb is that any university careers service will provide graduates of other universities with help (including internet access) for up to three years after graduation. Some careers services do charge (more likely in the bigger cities), but fees tend to be reasonable. The University of Bristol for example charges a one-off fee of \u00a314 (\u00a37 to the unemployed) to alumnae of other universities. 6. Job centres One advantage of being unemployed is that after six months of claiming benefit you become eligible for the New Deal. Along with all the free stamps, word processing and printing facilities which this scheme offers, the organisations which deliver it should also be able to arrange free internet access. Whatever option you use, one thing is certain, this situation is not going to last for long. This means that in 30 years' time you can fascinate your own children with your stories of how they used to hire out the net by the hour.",

A prime slot which would have cost $3,500 now costs $12,500. </p> <p>The advertising binge is entirely localised, and is concentrated in the states where the big contests are tightest. In St Louis, Missouri, you will be deluged with political ads. But switch on in Washington DC and all you will get is advertising for the Virginia senate race. Here, in the safest Democratic stronghold in the US, the presidential campaigns do not need to spend a cent. </p> <p>The spending frenzy is especially focused on the programmes watched by the target voters. Almost by definition, the much sought-after independents do not watch political programmes or the news. They watch soaps and game shows, the programmes with the most expensive advertising slots.

      "body": "<p>It's usually pretty easy to predict which pop stars will end up confessing all to the tabloids in one of those \"My Drug Hell\" pieces. Marti Pellow definitely wasn't one of them. The chipper housewives' choice who led Glasgow's Wet Wet Wet to 26 hit singles (including the sickeningly sincere Love Is All Around, which stayed at number one for 15 long weeks in 1994) was the good boy in a profession of delinquents and misfits. Aptly nicknamed Smiler since schooldays, his only addiction seemed to be an attachment to the old R&amp;B albums that inspired him to form a band back in the mid-80s. He was the Ronan Keating of his day, the perfect gent with no bad habits.</p> <p>That was before the revelation, in February 1999, that Smiler wasn't so well-adjusted after all - he collapsed at the Conrad Hotel in Chelsea, west London, from an apparent drugs binge. The shock had barely subsided before his girlfriend, a former Miss Scotland named Eileen Catterson, revealed the even more unlikely truth: he had been on heroin for three years, and on the day in question became ill from \"unintentionally\" mixing alcohol with prescription drugs that he was using to withdraw from the heroin.</p> <p>It was passed off as an accident, but Pellow now admits, \"I was weaning myself off smack with methadone and Librium, yet I was still self-destructive, so I thought, 'Have a drink!' I drank copious amounts of vodka and Strega for two or three hours, and collapsed.\"</p> <p>My drugs hell, indeed. Suddenly Pellow, who had been quietly forgotten about since Wet Wet Wet's long run of hits ended in 1997, was front-page news again. It wasn't just the drugs that shocked, but the realisation that, in an age where celebrities compulsively air their private lives, so little was known of his. He'd been a major star, and his relationship with Catterson made them the Caledonian equivalent of Posh and Becks, but he had seemed so uninterestingly normal that the media had left him alone.</p> <p>\"He was the clean-cut boy with the nice grin, so when people found out he was a heavy drugs user they were so shocked, especially because there were never even any rumours,\" says a Scottish tabloid reporter. His former publicist, Linda Valentine, adds, \"I was completely stunned when I heard, because I'd had chats about heroin with him and he knew it was a disaster area.\"</p> <p>Pellow has maintained a wary silence until now. He's never been one for five-page spreads in Hello! anyway, but now he needed space to pull himself together as he prepared to relaunch his career. His debut solo album will be released early next year, and next month he begins a tour in which he'll be playing his new music. Finally he's feeling more confident about talking publicly.</p> <p>\"I'm more in touch with my feelings now,\" he says wryly. \"A while ago, I had a really weird feeling of impending doom and I got really uptight - you know the kind of thing? And my friends who'd been in the same situation, they said, 'It's just a feeling, Marti.'\" He shakes his head in wonder, almost embarrassed.</p> <p>He has the air of a man who has the chance of making a new beginning and is going to make the most of it as he takes a seat in a restaurant near Kensington Palace and orders a cappuccino - caffeine being the only drug, other than nicotine, in which he still indulges. Clean since July 1999, and a conscientious attender of Narcotics Anonymous meetings, Pellow is evangelical about the NA programme, which he says changed his life. He's on the fourth step, which advises \"making a moral inventory\". Apparently, this is the most difficult step, because it requires complete honesty on the addict's part. He says that it has forced him to rethink his priorities: \"That step's a long-term project. Living with an addict is so frustrating because [other people] want to help, but it's got to come from the addict,\" he says in an accent that remains crunchy despite 13 years spent mostly outside Scotland. \"Sobriety has been humbling, being in these rooms [at NA meetings]. There's a great cross-section of people. I hadn't done shit in 10 years because everything was done for me. I paid wages, so I didn't have to think of anything. Check myself on to a plane? Get my passport? 'This way, Mr Pellow, this way.' If it happens long enough, it becomes the norm. For me, it's been a real godsend that I can get in touch with my feelings.\"</p> <p>He speaks with the earnestness of the newly sober, so absorbed that he's soon leaning forward and making unwavering eye contact. After three years of drug abuse he is still handsome enough - or famous enough - for the waitress to flutter a bit as she brings his coffee. He's rather too thin - he's 5ft 11in and claims he was down to nine-and-a-half stone during his worst patch - but, physically, has weathered pretty well. The only outward sign of his travails is one of those mood bracelets, black for \"peace and serenity\", worn on the opposite wrist from a dangly gold Cartier watch. The latter was a gift from Elton John's ex-manager, John Reid, who managed Pellow for a short time last year before they split in mysterious circumstances that neither is willing to discuss.</p> <p>It's late morning, and Pellow is in talkative mood. I'd been told as much by his new songwriting partner, former Squeeze singer Chris Difford (the Cockney baritone on Cool For Cats). The two met in the Priory, where Difford was being treated for cocaine addiction, and Difford now functions as lyricist and unofficial helper. He ushers us to a table, gives Pellow a paternally anxious glance and adjourns to the lobby, where he settles down with a copy of the Mirror. Difford's involvement has been questioned by Pellow's former manager from the Wet Wet Wet years, Elliot Davies, from whom he split last year - \"Chris Difford has never managed a band in his life,\" Davies gripes - but it's clear that his role is more to do with emotional support than business.</p> <p>Pellow talks with hardly a pause for two hours, sketching the 5am panic of running out of drugs, the Florida cottage where he spent Christmas 1998 alone and desperate, how he felt finishing treatment and going straight back on to heroin. \"I was depressed every day. There was a tremendous amount of isolation. Just leave me alone with my drug of choice,\" he remembers.</p> <p>Yet there were never any rumours because he seemed so happy in his job as frontman of Scotland's biggest band. A natural attention-seeker, he was completely at home in front of huge audiences (a situation that occurred less often as the 90s wore on), flourishing under the spotlight. When his looks got him more notice than the rest of Wet Wet Wet, he didn't even pretend to be embarrassed. Some musicians find touring a necessary evil; for Pellow, it was an opportunity to bask in his public's approval. Linda Valentine says, \"He was a charmer who just wanted to be liked. In the early days, when he finished a show, he'd go to the gym. I never even saw him smoke a spliff.\"</p> <p>Yet once Wet Wet Wet's career peaked with Love Is All Around and began a gentle downward slide, he needed numbing drugs just to get through the day. What he's never talked about until now is the lifelong sense of emptiness that drove him to find validation on stage: \"I'd like to have thought I was a normal working-class kid, but I can remember being six or seven at school, and at the end of the day I would go off alone. I always felt there was something missing. I'd want to be with people, but then I couldn't because I could only take so much. The most poignant thing about my childhood was that I was always alone. When I discovered things - like the first time I've ever seen this tunnel or whatever, the things that kids do together - I'd do it alone.\"</p> <p>It's an equation that you keep encountering in the music business: an empty childhood plus a craving for attention equals a troubled pop star. \"Big ego plus low self-esteem? That's the makings of an addict,\" points out a friend of mine who has grappled with addiction himself. But what's unclear, and even Pellow can't put his finger on it, is the source of this emptiness. His family, who come from a working-class part of Glasgow called Clydebank, was happy, he says, and even exceptionally attractive. His father was a bricklayer, his mother a singer and Marti, whose real name is Mark McLachlan, and his older brother John were the apples of their eye.

Pellow's silky singing was praised by Al Green's producer, Willie Mitchell, as the best he'd heard since Green himself, but the package as a whole attracted slatings that stopped the Wets rising to the superleague. In a tangential way, much of the negativity was generated by Pellow himself or, rather, by his looks.

      "bodyText": "It's usually pretty easy to predict which pop stars will end up confessing all to the tabloids in one of those \"My Drug Hell\" pieces. Marti Pellow definitely wasn't one of them. The chipper housewives' choice who led Glasgow's Wet Wet Wet to 26 hit singles (including the sickeningly sincere Love Is All Around, which stayed at number one for 15 long weeks in 1994) was the good boy in a profession of delinquents and misfits. Aptly nicknamed Smiler since schooldays, his only addiction seemed to be an attachment to the old R&amp;B albums that inspired him to form a band back in the mid-80s. He was the Ronan Keating of his day, the perfect gent with no bad habits. That was before the revelation, in February 1999, that Smiler wasn't so well-adjusted after all - he collapsed at the Conrad Hotel in Chelsea, west London, from an apparent drugs binge. The shock had barely subsided before his girlfriend, a former Miss Scotland named Eileen Catterson, revealed the even more unlikely truth: he had been on heroin for three years, and on the day in question became ill from \"unintentionally\" mixing alcohol with prescription drugs that he was using to withdraw from the heroin. It was passed off as an accident, but Pellow now admits, \"I was weaning myself off smack with methadone and Librium, yet I was still self-destructive, so I thought, 'Have a drink!' I drank copious amounts of vodka and Strega for two or three hours, and collapsed.\" My drugs hell, indeed. Suddenly Pellow, who had been quietly forgotten about since Wet Wet Wet's long run of hits ended in 1997, was front-page news again. It wasn't just the drugs that shocked, but the realisation that, in an age where celebrities compulsively air their private lives, so little was known of his. He'd been a major star, and his relationship with Catterson made them the Caledonian equivalent of Posh and Becks, but he had seemed so uninterestingly normal that the media had left him alone. \"He was the clean-cut boy with the nice grin, so when people found out he was a heavy drugs user they were so shocked, especially because there were never even any rumours,\" says a Scottish tabloid reporter. His former publicist, Linda Valentine, adds, \"I was completely stunned when I heard, because I'd had chats about heroin with him and he knew it was a disaster area.\" Pellow has maintained a wary silence until now. He's never been one for five-page spreads in Hello! anyway, but now he needed space to pull himself together as he prepared to relaunch his career. His debut solo album will be released early next year, and next month he begins a tour in which he'll be playing his new music. Finally he's feeling more confident about talking publicly. \"I'm more in touch with my feelings now,\" he says wryly. \"A while ago, I had a really weird feeling of impending doom and I got really uptight - you know the kind of thing? And my friends who'd been in the same situation, they said, 'It's just a feeling, Marti.'\" He shakes his head in wonder, almost embarrassed. He has the air of a man who has the chance of making a new beginning and is going to make the most of it as he takes a seat in a restaurant near Kensington Palace and orders a cappuccino - caffeine being the only drug, other than nicotine, in which he still indulges. Clean since July 1999, and a conscientious attender of Narcotics Anonymous meetings, Pellow is evangelical about the NA programme, which he says changed his life. He's on the fourth step, which advises \"making a moral inventory\". Apparently, this is the most difficult step, because it requires complete honesty on the addict's part. He says that it has forced him to rethink his priorities: \"That step's a long-term project. Living with an addict is so frustrating because [other people] want to help, but it's got to come from the addict,\" he says in an accent that remains crunchy despite 13 years spent mostly outside Scotland. \"Sobriety has been humbling, being in these rooms [at NA meetings]. There's a great cross-section of people. I hadn't done shit in 10 years because everything was done for me. I paid wages, so I didn't have to think of anything. Check myself on to a plane? Get my passport? 'This way, Mr Pellow, this way.' If it happens long enough, it becomes the norm. For me, it's been a real godsend that I can get in touch with my feelings.\" He speaks with the earnestness of the newly sober, so absorbed that he's soon leaning forward and making unwavering eye contact. After three years of drug abuse he is still handsome enough - or famous enough - for the waitress to flutter a bit as she brings his coffee. He's rather too thin - he's 5ft 11in and claims he was down to nine-and-a-half stone during his worst patch - but, physically, has weathered pretty well. The only outward sign of his travails is one of those mood bracelets, black for \"peace and serenity\", worn on the opposite wrist from a dangly gold Cartier watch. The latter was a gift from Elton John's ex-manager, John Reid, who managed Pellow for a short time last year before they split in mysterious circumstances that neither is willing to discuss. It's late morning, and Pellow is in talkative mood. I'd been told as much by his new songwriting partner, former Squeeze singer Chris Difford (the Cockney baritone on Cool For Cats). The two met in the Priory, where Difford was being treated for cocaine addiction, and Difford now functions as lyricist and unofficial helper. He ushers us to a table, gives Pellow a paternally anxious glance and adjourns to the lobby, where he settles down with a copy of the Mirror. Difford's involvement has been questioned by Pellow's former manager from the Wet Wet Wet years, Elliot Davies, from whom he split last year - \"Chris Difford has never managed a band in his life,\" Davies gripes - but it's clear that his role is more to do with emotional support than business. Pellow talks with hardly a pause for two hours, sketching the 5am panic of running out of drugs, the Florida cottage where he spent Christmas 1998 alone and desperate, how he felt finishing treatment and going straight back on to heroin. \"I was depressed every day. There was a tremendous amount of isolation. Just leave me alone with my drug of choice,\" he remembers. Yet there were never any rumours because he seemed so happy in his job as frontman of Scotland's biggest band. A natural attention-seeker, he was completely at home in front of huge audiences (a situation that occurred less often as the 90s wore on), flourishing under the spotlight. When his looks got him more notice than the rest of Wet Wet Wet, he didn't even pretend to be embarrassed. Some musicians find touring a necessary evil; for Pellow, it was an opportunity to bask in his public's approval. Linda Valentine says, \"He was a charmer who just wanted to be liked. In the early days, when he finished a show, he'd go to the gym. I never even saw him smoke a spliff.\" Yet once Wet Wet Wet's career peaked with Love Is All Around and began a gentle downward slide, he needed numbing drugs just to get through the day. What he's never talked about until now is the lifelong sense of emptiness that drove him to find validation on stage: \"I'd like to have thought I was a normal working-class kid, but I can remember being six or seven at school, and at the end of the day I would go off alone. I always felt there was something missing. I'd want to be with people, but then I couldn't because I could only take so much. The most poignant thing about my childhood was that I was always alone. When I discovered things - like the first time I've ever seen this tunnel or whatever, the things that kids do together - I'd do it alone.\" It's an equation that you keep encountering in the music business: an empty childhood plus a craving for attention equals a troubled pop star. \"Big ego plus low self-esteem? That's the makings of an addict,\" points out a friend of mine who has grappled with addiction himself. But what's unclear, and even Pellow can't put his finger on it, is the source of this emptiness. His family, who come from a working-class part of Glasgow called Clydebank, was happy, he says, and even exceptionally attractive. His father was a bricklayer, his mother a singer and Marti, whose real name is Mark McLachlan, and his older brother John were the apples of their eye. John, who at 38 is three years Marti's senior, has been an alcoholic for some years. \"He's working through it, but it's got to come from him,\" he sighs. \"Is it better to be good-looking?\" Pellow muses. \"Ask John Merrick, the Elephant Man. Being nice-looking and a great singer ... can I have all that and credibility, too?\" Ah, the C-word. Musical credibility has always been at the top of his wish-list, and the lack of same has been a thorn in his side for years. Not that he isn't justly renowned for his expressive voice - an early NME review advised him to ditch the rest of Wet Wet Wet - but real kudos somehow eludes him. When lists of classic British male vocalists are compiled, he's rarely included - overlooked, perhaps, or maybe just too identified with Wet Wet Wet's period of teen-idoldom. He never wanted to be a pop star in the first place, seeing himself and schoolfriends Graeme Clark, Tommy Cunningham and Neil Mitchell as inheritors of a Celtic white-soul tradition stretching back to the Average White Band in the 70s. Their heroes were Al Green and Marvin Gaye, unusual influences for a young band in the middle of the Culture Club 80s. Studying their musty vinyl records as if they were texts, Wet Wet Wet developed a soul-tinged sound that was hugely successful with the public but never quite passed muster with the critics. The Virgin Encyclopaedia Of Popular Music sniffs that they were \"agreeable blue-eyed soul\", while others derided them as \"faceless\" or \"innocuous\". Pellow's silky singing was praised by Al Green's producer, Willie Mitchell, as the best he'd heard since Green himself, but the package as a whole attracted slatings that stopped the Wets rising to the superleague. In a tangential way, much of the negativity was generated by Pellow himself or, rather, by his looks. With a face like his, he was a bespoke teen idol, and the teen 'zines pounced as soon as the band's debut single, Wishing I Was Lucky, came out in April 1987. With his first Smash Hits cover went any hope of credibility. Worse, he seemed unsure of which side of the fence he was on, anxious as he was for both populist adulation and critical plaudits. Wet Wet Wet also had the bad luck to come along just as British pop was about to be purged by the Madchester movement. The Wets - unfortunate abbreviation - suddenly looked like earnest traditionalists in stonewashed denim. So, while they were commercially hot, selling 2.5 million copies of their first album, Popped In, Souled Out, the more adult press never took them seriously. It bothered Pellow - a lot. \"Credibility and success never came hand in hand,\" he says resignedly. \"We had the success, so who was I searching for to say it's okay? The magazines, the papers? Within the nucleus of the band, they were annoyed that I was singled out.

Fresh off the dole, they indulged themselves like lottery winners. It wasn't just Ferraris (Pellow had two) and big houses, but larks such as having curries flown from their favourite Glasgow takeaway, Cafe India, to gigs in Europe. \"Who cares how much it cost?\" he says, still amused. \"It made sense at the time. A lot of stuff like that went on. We were young guys with lots of money and no ties and not a care in the world. I look back and think how amazing it was, first time in Paris, the Eiffel Tower, Australia. I'd never even been out of the UK before.\" He still can't quite articulate what he sought from drugs, just that an indefinable something was missing from an otherwise enviable life. He had \u00a33 million in the bank, the esteem of fans and a long-term relationship with the supportive Catterson. And yet, he gropes to explain, \"it became hard work\". It is currently fashionable for pop stars to insist that, despite achieving everything they have ever hoped for, it hasn't filled the void within. Robbie Williams claims that being rich and adored has left him \"in bits\", while Spice Girl Mel C recently admitted to being on anti-depressants. The term \"paradise syndrome\" has been coined to describe the feeling, pithily summed up by the late Michael Hutchence, of \"getting to the top and finding there's nothing there\". When it hit Pellow, 10 years into his career, he smothered the feeling with the strongest medication he could find. \"The heroin started around 1996.

The dog's owner, Bill Jones, said he tried to grab the labrador but was knocked down by the alligator's tail. Alligators can be found in every big lake, river, bayou, creek and farm pond in Louisiana, said Steve Hebert, a wildlife division supervisor. AP, Bossier City",

      "body": "<p>George W Bush has surged to a 13-point opinion poll lead over Al Gore with just 10 days to go before the US presidential election on November 7.</p> <p>Mr Bush, the Republican nominee, is on 52%, with the Democrat, Mr Gore, now trailing on 39% in the latest Gallup daily tracking poll for CNN and USA Today. The Green candidate, Ralph Nader, has 4%.</p> <p>The new poll means that Mr Bush has benefited from a three-point swing in the past 24 hours, a remarkable boost by any standards. In Thursday's Gallup poll, Mr Bush was on 49% with Mr Gore 42% and Mr Nader 3%.</p> <p>Yesterday's 13-point margin is Mr Bush's biggest lead over Mr Gore since before the party conventions in August.</p> <p>If the Gallup poll is correct - and some experts think it could be a rogue result of the kind that shows up in any campaign - Mr Gore would seem to face an almost hopeless task with only 10 days before election day.</p> <p>The Republicans, meanwhile, stand on the threshold of regaining the White House after eight years of Bill Clinton's presidency.</p> <p>The accuracy of the Gallup finding was challenged last night by the polling director of the Washington Post, which is conducting its own daily tracking polls, similar to the Gallup survey. The latest Washington Post survey showed Mr Bush with a much narrower 48%-45% lead over Mr Gore, while a third tracking survey for Reuters/MSNBC showed Mr Bush on a slim one-point lead.</p> <p>\"All I can say is I would love to be tracking the election that Gallup is tracking,\" said Richard Morin, the Post's polling director. \"It's a lot more interesting election than the one I'm looking at. I see something far more stable than the Gallup numbers suggest.\"</p> <p>But a separate Gallup survey for Time magazine today also showed Mr Bush with a clear lead, 49%-43%, over Mr Gore, with Mr Nader on 3%.</p> <p>All three tracking surveys produce rolling results based on the last three days of daily surveying. Each day's new result is obtained by adding the latest day's sample and discarding the four-day-old segment.</p> <p>Such tracking polls have become increasingly prominent in this year's Bush-Gore contest because of what has otherwise been an exceptionally close and volatile race. Mr Gore led by 46% to 45% in Gallup's tracking survey as recently as Tuesday.</p> <p>The fluidity of the closest presidential contest in decades was underlined by a series of state-based polls which brought some comfort to all the candidates. Mr Gore campaigned yesterday in Pennsylvania where a poll gave him a five-point lead. Mr Bush, meanwhile, was in Michigan, where the two men are in a virtual dead heat in the state which could ultimately tip the balance. Meanwhile, Mr Bush was eight points up in Ohio, a local poll suggested.</p> <p>Mr Nader's increasing importance was underlined by a poll in Minnesota that showed him holding the difference between the two frontrunners. Mr Bush had a 41% to 38% lead over Mr Gore in the always independent-minded state, with Mr Nader on 10%.</p> <p>The increasingly tense and bitter final stages of the election were marked yesterday by an extraordinary off-message move by supporters of the Bush campaign in Texas, who began airing a television advertisement implying that Mr Gore would lead the US into a nuclear conflict with China.</p> <p>The ad, which is modelled on a celebrated 1964 commercial which did much to destroy the presidential campaign of the Republican presidential candidate, Barry Goldwater, in his contest with Lyndon Johnson, shows a young girl picking the petals off a daisy as a nuclear explosion occurs. It began running in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida yesterday.</p> <p>The commentary claims the Clinton-Gore administration \"sold\" America's security \"to Communist red China in exchange for campaign contributions\".</p> <p>Mr Gore claimed the ad was \"another personal attack\" by Mr Bush's supporters. A campaign spokesman for Mr Bush disavowed the ad.</p>",

      "bodyText": "George W Bush has surged to a 13-point opinion poll lead over Al Gore with just 10 days to go before the US presidential election on November 7. Mr Bush, the Republican nominee, is on 52%, with the Democrat, Mr Gore, now trailing on 39% in the latest Gallup daily tracking poll for CNN and USA Today. The Green candidate, Ralph Nader, has 4%. The new poll means that Mr Bush has benefited from a three-point swing in the past 24 hours, a remarkable boost by any standards. In Thursday's Gallup poll, Mr Bush was on 49% with Mr Gore 42% and Mr Nader 3%. Yesterday's 13-point margin is Mr Bush's biggest lead over Mr Gore since before the party conventions in August. If the Gallup poll is correct - and some experts think it could be a rogue result of the kind that shows up in any campaign - Mr Gore would seem to face an almost hopeless task with only 10 days before election day. The Republicans, meanwhile, stand on the threshold of regaining the White House after eight years of Bill Clinton's presidency. The accuracy of the Gallup finding was challenged last night by the polling director of the Washington Post, which is conducting its own daily tracking polls, similar to the Gallup survey. The latest Washington Post survey showed Mr Bush with a much narrower 48%-45% lead over Mr Gore, while a third tracking survey for Reuters/MSNBC showed Mr Bush on a slim one-point lead. \"All I can say is I would love to be tracking the election that Gallup is tracking,\" said Richard Morin, the Post's polling director. \"It's a lot more interesting election than the one I'm looking at. I see something far more stable than the Gallup numbers suggest.\" But a separate Gallup survey for Time magazine today also showed Mr Bush with a clear lead, 49%-43%, over Mr Gore, with Mr Nader on 3%. All three tracking surveys produce rolling results based on the last three days of daily surveying. Each day's new result is obtained by adding the latest day's sample and discarding the four-day-old segment. Such tracking polls have become increasingly prominent in this year's Bush-Gore contest because of what has otherwise been an exceptionally close and volatile race. Mr Gore led by 46% to 45% in Gallup's tracking survey as recently as Tuesday. The fluidity of the closest presidential contest in decades was underlined by a series of state-based polls which brought some comfort to all the candidates. Mr Gore campaigned yesterday in Pennsylvania where a poll gave him a five-point lead. Mr Bush, meanwhile, was in Michigan, where the two men are in a virtual dead heat in the state which could ultimately tip the balance. Meanwhile, Mr Bush was eight points up in Ohio, a local poll suggested. Mr Nader's increasing importance was underlined by a poll in Minnesota that showed him holding the difference between the two frontrunners. Mr Bush had a 41% to 38% lead over Mr Gore in the always independent-minded state, with Mr Nader on 10%. The increasingly tense and bitter final stages of the election were marked yesterday by an extraordinary off-message move by supporters of the Bush campaign in Texas, who began airing a television advertisement implying that Mr Gore would lead the US into a nuclear conflict with China. The ad, which is modelled on a celebrated 1964 commercial which did much to destroy the presidential campaign of the Republican presidential candidate, Barry Goldwater, in his contest with Lyndon Johnson, shows a young girl picking the petals off a daisy as a nuclear explosion occurs. It began running in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida yesterday. The commentary claims the Clinton-Gore administration \"sold\" America's security \"to Communist red China in exchange for campaign contributions\". Mr Gore claimed the ad was \"another personal attack\" by Mr Bush's supporters. A campaign spokesman for Mr Bush disavowed the ad.",

At the least, yesterday's deal will give Allied a consolation prize if it looses out on the bidding for the rest of Seagram.",

      "bodyText": "Government scientists are making an urgent reassessment of the possible size of the human BSE epidemic after confirmation that a 74-year-old man has died of the disease. The victim , believed to be from North Yorkshire, was 20 years older than the previous oldest known case of the inevitably fatal condition. The man died last year and his case was only revealed after doctors, worried that this might be a highly unusual instance of the disease known as variant CJD, referred the case to the CJD survillance unit at Edinburgh. It was also revealed last night that officials responsible for the safety of medicines are to look at the use of vaccines used throughout the 1970s. This followed the finding of Lord Phillips' BSE inquiry report, published on Thursday, that BSE might have existed in a series of rapidly increasing epidemic waves from 1970 until it finally became obvious as hundreds of cows began to die in 1987-88. Previous checks concentrated on those using calf serum from pregnant cows used to develop products in the 1980s and only last week the Department of Health found that one of those was still in use despite guidelines that were meant to ban the use of products made from British bovine sources. Victims of vCJD have previously all been between 15 and 54, although a 14-year-old girl who first displayed signs of the disease when she was 12 is still alive. But the latest revelation of a much older victim is expected to lead to increased scrutiny by neurologists of older patients, previously thought less susceptible to the disease. The government is already funding a study in Nottingham in which experts are re-assessing diagnoses of dementia in older people who died in the area in recent years. But it has not yet uncovered any mistakes. The health department said it would not hesistate to act quickly if any new cases of older victims were revealed. No one was prepared to speculate openly on the significance of the new discovery last night but the government will be hoping the latest victim was an older consumer, during the 1980s, of cheap beef products that were usually eaten by far younger people. Among alternatives being considered, however, is that the older man came from a previous wave of \"infection\" during the 1970s when the population's exposure to BSE was far lower and the possibility of being unlucky to catch a fatal \"dose\" far lower. Eating cheap meat before anti-BSE measures to protect human health were phased in from 1989 is the explanation still favoured by most experts but Lord Phillips said there must be a re-examination of other possible routes. The most recent estimates of the size of the epidemic - from just over 100 to over 100,000 - were based on the pattern of cases so far, the percentage of the population thought at risk, the relative infectivity of cattle, and the likely incubation period. The Oxford-based team responsible for the estimates suggested in August that young people were either more susceptible or more exposed to BSE. But Prof Roy Anderson, one of that team and a member of the government's spongiform encephalopathy advisory committee (Seac), said of the new case: \"This leads to a reappraisal of the ages at which people are susceptible to this disease.\" He said there were still many unknowns about the disease, including the incubation period. \"If that incubation period is short - and this is an optimistic scenario - say eight years, then this year and the next two years may see the worst of the epidemic. \"If, which is equally probably at the moment, that incubation operiod is long, perhaps 20-30 years, then we have only seen a very small part of the epidemic.\" He added: \"We can't say with any certainty where the number will lie.\" Seac was already reassessing predictions because of a sharp rise in cases of vCJD in recent months.

Children may be more vulnerable because of their developing nervous system. The tiny pulses of microwaves emitted by mobile phones are of the same type as the radiation used in microwave ovens. </p> <p>But the safety message is mixed. A DTI report suggested hands-free kits reduce radiation entering the brain. But the Consumers' Association said the kits act like aerials, increasing the radiation. </p> <p><b> GM foods</b> </p> <p>Some scientists fear the artificial nature of modern genetic technologies could damage our environment and health. Ecologists are worried about the danger of herbicide-resistant genes spreading to wild flowers and plants. There is little evidence so far on the dangers but other scientists welcome the development, which could lead to a reduction in the use of pesticides. </p> <p><b> Fluoride in water</b> </p> <p>Opponents claim fluoride causes bone disease, cancer, hyperactive behaviour and impaired intellect, and argue that adding it to water amounts to enforced medication. </p> <p>Supporters say adding it to water supplies would be the single most effective way of improving dental health. </p> <p><b> Nuclear power stations</b> </p> <p>In April, research suggested women living downwind of mudflats that contain discharges from Hinkley Point in Somerset have twice the risk of breast cancer. Leukaemia clusters have been found near all three nuclear reprocessing plants. So far scientists have failed to agree on the cause. </p> <p><b> Antibiotics in foods</b> </p> <p>Growth promoters have been used extensively in animals' feed and water in British farming for 40 years, especially in the poultry and pig industries.

      "bodyText": "Mobile phones Initial scientific evidence has found exposure to radio frequency radiation might have subtle effects on biological functions, including the brain. Children may be more vulnerable because of their developing nervous system. The tiny pulses of microwaves emitted by mobile phones are of the same type as the radiation used in microwave ovens. But the safety message is mixed. A DTI report suggested hands-free kits reduce radiation entering the brain. But the Consumers' Association said the kits act like aerials, increasing the radiation. GM foods Some scientists fear the artificial nature of modern genetic technologies could damage our environment and health. Ecologists are worried about the danger of herbicide-resistant genes spreading to wild flowers and plants. There is little evidence so far on the dangers but other scientists welcome the development, which could lead to a reduction in the use of pesticides. Fluoride in water Opponents claim fluoride causes bone disease, cancer, hyperactive behaviour and impaired intellect, and argue that adding it to water amounts to enforced medication. Supporters say adding it to water supplies would be the single most effective way of improving dental health. Nuclear power stations In April, research suggested women living downwind of mudflats that contain discharges from Hinkley Point in Somerset have twice the risk of breast cancer. Leukaemia clusters have been found near all three nuclear reprocessing plants. So far scientists have failed to agree on the cause. Antibiotics in foods Growth promoters have been used extensively in animals' feed and water in British farming for 40 years, especially in the poultry and pig industries. Proponents argue that chickens grow faster and the saving on feed costs is vital in keeping businesses viable and producing birds of the quality required by supermarkets. But there are worries that humans who eat them will become immune to antibiotic medicines.

But it is the Red Square \"Kremlin Centre\" which is raising eyebrows in Moscow and provoking sniggers about the latest folie de grandeur planned by the social climbers in the Kremlin. They envisage it rising beside St Basil's at an estimated cost of \u00a3200m, an estimate that will inevitably prove too little by half.

But at first sight the goatee-bearded man in the unprepossessing suit, shirt and shoes in the lobby of the Celtic Manor Resort, Newport, Gwent, barely looks the part: more like a Valleys politician or small-scale entrepreneur. Until he speaks. Out comes a torrent of words, anecdotes, stories, accompanied by a whirlwind of gesticulations. </p> <p>He is an inveterate story-teller, a chronicler of south Wales' industrial history. A group of Vancouver tourists gawp in bafflement and awe as he recites the tale of the Powell family, founders of the Powell Duffryn engineering group, including the fate of a scion eaten alive in what is now Ethiopia, and then moves on to Swansea's role as the hub of the global non-ferrous metals industry for two centuries. \"I like history, industrial history,\" he tells them, pointing to a brass railing in the lobby. \"You know where brass comes from originally. Swansea. That's where.\" Then he is gone, out on to a nearby green of one of the three championship golf courses surrounding the \u00a3120m resort and off into local Roman history. \"See over there, just beyond the clubhouse, there's the remains of a Roman training camp we found, and [a sudden switch of gear] over here we're building corporate golf suites.\" </p> <p>But this global player has his eyes fixed firmly on the present and future. His roots may be in south-east Wales, in the Gwent valleys but home is Ottawa and north London - and the revolutionary world of broadband telecoms technology and the high-risk, high-stakes domain of venture capital. \"The ability to communicate in broadband is a dramatic instigator of change in everything we do in life and I'm not going to miss out on it,\" he says by way of dispelling any suggestion, his billions made, he is ready to retire at the age of 57. </p> <p>Matthews is good at two things: networking and networking. He devises solutions and applications for telecoms networks. Brash, pugnacious, ruthless, demanding he may be - \"I take concrete with my cereal\" - but he gets on with people. Celtic Manor, which he founded two years ago on the site of the boarded-up nursing home where he was born, is, with its 400 rooms, 32 suites, convention centre and golf courses, a magnet for \"the most senior people\" in the global telecoms industry. \"For some reason they all love golf and I can use the hotel as a base to conduct business - and, no, I don't have time to play.\" </p> <p>He has made his money in two ways. First, by building up his own businesses and selling them on, and by providing the seed-corn for spin-offs and start-ups. An obsessive fixer of things - clocks, bikes, cars - in his native Newbridge, he started work at 16 in BT's research labs in Dollis Hill, north London, and turned holidays in Ottawa at the age of 26 into a permanent stay. He set up Mitel in 1972, making integrated circuits and inventing private switchboards (PBX). \"We set it up with $4,000 of borrowed money and now it's making $1.5bn revenues.It doubled its revenues every year for the first 11 years and generally in electronics a successful company can do that and remain stable. Anything above that can be unstable.\"</p> <p>The company ran into problems with the break-up of AT&amp;T in 1982 and he sold a 51% controlling stake three years later to BT. By then a multi-millionaire, he founded Newbridge Networks a year later and earlier this year, 15 years on, sold it to Alcatel for \u00a34.4bn, taking a 3% stake in the French group to become its biggest individual stockholder. \"Alcatel's shares have just about doubled since the acquisition which is good for them and their shareholders, and employees of Newbridge.\" </p> <p>He talks excitedly about the spin-offs or affiliates he has helped nurture. \"In my career I have started up around 40 companies and I have lost only two, when the normal success rate is one in 10, and some of them have had an absolutely staggering success.\" He reels off a string of businesses: Vancouver-based Abatis, set up with $5m and sold four years later to Redback of California for $1.2bn; Bookham; Encipher; Orchestry. </p> <p>Matthews uses as his funding vehicle Celtic House Investments, set up in 1994 and run by an old school friend, Roger Maggs. He says he has invested $100m in the past five years and the companies he so far has not floated are alone worth well over $1bn. \"This coming year we will put in $250m. Investment capital has dramatically escalated in the last 12 months, just for Celtic House alone. There's more venture capital available than over the past five years, more than any time be fore.\" The main reason he cites is the potential unleashed by broadband networking, seeing an exponential, explosive growth in digital subscriber lines, digital cable modems, local multi-point distribution services and the like. </p> <p>\"Demand grossly outstrips the ability to supply and the point is that these networks are always available, always on, rather than having to be accessed by dialling via a modem,\" he says, a host of statistics about the potential growth pouring forth. \"Anything you've seen in the last 10 years in networking technology is just the tip of the iceberg. This is one of the most exciting developments ever in human endeavour because networking is fundamental to every aspect of life.\" </p> <p>Matthews has, therefore, no time for the doom-laden forecasts that the \"inflated bubble\" cocooning the Ciscos, Lucents, Nortels of this new world, even BT, is about to burst. \"Absolutely not, there may be a few problems now with the share prices but this is such a titchy bit of the iceberg and the value of the overhaul of the network - imagine, 1bn lines to be upgraded - is so staggeringly high that the entire sector will continue to do well. And the applications are even bigger once the basic highway has been laid. \"Until you put the roads in, the cars, buses and garages can't happen. This is dramatic and it's now. You've got to take advantage of the infrastructure and the applications, as in one or two years all the roads will be in place.\" For all his self-confidence he sees his own role in this process in a strangely coy manner. \"Timing in life is everything. If I had done this five years ago, surprise, surprise, there were no roads to run the cars on and now there are. All it takes is just awareness of what's going on to be innovative and inventive,\" he says, a trifle disarmingly. \"There will be losers as they will not be able to accommodate this dramatic change but opportunities are opening up like never before and you don't have to be a builder of the big switchers and optical networking to do well.\" </p> <p>The first application of broader bandwidth he sees is in fast-responding internet services - a graveyard for profit expectations until now. But his own sights are set on what he calls videocentric applications: using broadband networks in areas ranging from security and surveillance to health care, where he promises a budgetary revolution. </p> <p>Matthews is now chief executive of March Networks, an Ottawa-based offshoot of Newbridge that used to be called Telexis which itself specialised in digital video recording products for security and operations management. Earlier this month, March took over Elcombe, which provides technological solutions for the health-care market, for $15m equity and a share swap. The expanded company, he says, has secured $35m in equity funding. </p> <p>\"I can now do things for senior citizens in terms of health care which will help deal with a chronic shortage of nurses, for instance,\" he says. The new digital video applications can enable a nurse to treat or care for 15 patients online each day, compared to the perhaps five he or she might visit or see in a hospital or clinic. He is thinking ahead, according to his own motto: \"Don't be boring, do something\" or \"make a mark, don't be part of the living dead\". Amid this restless activity he still had time that day to take part in an \"innovation summit\" at his Celtic Manor resort and put the finishing details to his bid to stage the 2009 Ryder Cup, due to be submitted on Tuesday. It seems like a heroic one-man endeavour to put Wales on the map. </p> <p>The summit, attended by Rhodri Morgan, first secretary of the national assembly for Wales, came less than 24 hours after Panasonic became the latest Far East electronics group to scale down its Welsh operations, with the loss of 1,300 jobs. Matthews brushes aside this bad news in favour of the opportunities opening up for artists and content providers in Wales. \"We've got to create this entrepreneurialism and this is what they should focus on and they are. It's the first time in Wales I have ever heard anyone as prominent as Rhodri focus on such things. It's like a breath of fresh air.\" </p> <p>Terry Matthews, rich dynamic man of the world with a penchant for being a bon viveur, says he is trying to bring a taste of that world to his native country through his hotel complex above the M4. Even his new company, March, like Newbridge before, retains its Welsh origins - the name a play on pre-Tudor times when the region was known as Wales and the Marches, an ill-defined territory with no fixed border. \"Henry VII was born in Monmouth and was the Welsh person who became king of England, and his son, Henry VIII, nailed down the border. And broadband is disputed territory.\" It is a rich region where he would like to be king - and, like his Tudor predecessor, seems ready to chop off a few heads to do so. </p> <p><strong>The CV </strong></p> <p><strong>Born:</strong> Newport, Gwent, June 6, 1943 </p> <p><strong>Education:</strong> Schools in Newbridge, Gwent.

Buoyed by an opinion poll that showed overwhelming support for Mr Trimble among his party's voters, the UUP leader will announce a \"comprehensive and proportionate\" response to the IRA's \"failure\" to disarm. His gesture is designed to win round disillusioned unionists, typified by the UUP deputy leader, John Taylor, who voiced support yesterday for hardline opponents of Mr Trimble. Mr Trimble will face the political fight of his life today when hardliners, led by the UUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson, table a motion calling on the party to walk out of the power-sharing executive on November 30 if the IRA fails to disarm.

The association's chairman, David Thorp, decried the lack of wise heads watching the finances. </p> <p>\"The reason why the early dot.coms seemed to succeed was because they had no bag gage. Everyone was looking with fresh eyes and they went for it; the internet meant that barriers to entry were low and they had speed and verve. But what they did not have was business knowledge, and what we are now seeing is some of the more trusted business skills being integrated into new internet solutions.\" He adds that most venture capitalists avoided early dot.coms precisely because of their lack of business experience. </p> <p>This month saw the first high-profile signing of an older business star by his younger peers. Allan Leighton, 47, former chief executive officer of Wal-Mart Europe and Asda before that, is joining the board of lastminute.com. He will not be paid, but is receiving 1m share options for his role as non-executive chairman. </p> <p>Martha Lane Fox, the 27- year-old chief operating officer of lastminute says: \"We are thrilled that someone with Allan's track record of leadership in customer-focused businesses is joining us. Allan is someone we have respected for some time. As we talked to him about our vision it soon became clear that he would be extremely valuable in helping us to provide an even better service for our customers.\" </p> <p>Ronald Cohen, of venture capitalists Apax Partners, agrees that dot.coms are waking up to the value of experience. \"Young entrepreneurs are coming in and asking for experienced people; increasingly they are realising that they need this to get the business to the stock markets.\" </p> <p>And Charlotte Thorne, author of the Industrial Society report, says: \"The current requirement is for knowledge. Businesses need people who can employ their experience and understanding, their networks and their strategic vision to add value to organisations.\" She makes the point that businesses set up by entrepreneurs in their early 50s are twice as likely to survive as those started by people aged 20-25 and that by 2020 one in four of the workforce will be aged 50 or above. </p> <p>But are those who are bricks and mortar worldly wise readily able to transfer their skills to the virtual realm? </p> <p>Graham Woolley, aged 54, had spent most of his working life as a management consultant until he went into semi-retirement last year. His CV boasts that he has been director of business solutions at CGNU Insurance, and has also been principal of PricewaterhouseCoopers' management consultancy di vision - and that his skills and experience include analysing problems and issues, creating and implementing original solutions and organising third-party suppliers. </p> <p>He is now acting as a consultant to FashionNightmare.com, a website which aims to stimulate, educate, entertain and empower female teenagers, launched later this month. </p> <p>\"I was running a project employing Kath's (Kathleen Nickels, founder of FashionNightmare) husband. He said that he thought I was just the kind of person who could help the company get off the ground and I was interested in getting involved in a project. To date I have mainly been involved in forward planning and making sure that services are delivered. </p> <p>\"It's a kind of 'sorting out any messes' role - before me, Kath went to family and friends to try to get issues sorted out, but it is what I have spent most of my career doing. The biggest issue so far for FashionNightmare has been that it has not had enough money.\" </p> <p>He is not being paid for his input, but has taken an equity share in the company instead: \"I have a much more personal stake than I would have if it was just a matter of investment,\" he says. </p> <p>The decision-making process is essentially the same as with a traditional style company, so his experience is directly relevant, and his years in the business world mean that he can play a smoothing role. </p> <p>Ms Nickels has found that the process of raising money, finding the right team, managing third-party suppliers and actually launching a website has been more torturous than she had expected, even with her strong business background. She says that taking on Mr Woolley was one of the best long-term moves she has made so far in her bid to launch the site. </p> <p>Although she has been a management consultant - with US group Marakon, working both in the States and the UK, and writing the business model should not have been a problem, she found herself proposing ideas which, as a consultant, she would have pooh-poohed. </p> <p>\"It's amazing, now that I'm on my own, how much self-doubt creeps in and how excited I am when someone thinks what I'm doing is a good idea. Also, I did not go to business school, which is where I think the majority of strong networks are built. </p> <p>\"When you start out there are plenty of cynics, the kind of people who have just got their MBA and need to prove that they know more about the internet than you. They just want to rain on your parade and you need to be able to spot that. </p> <p>\"But what you really need is people who know a lot and will be able to criticise, but their criticism will be constructive.\" </p> <p>She adds that Mr Woolley's involvement also encouraged backers. \"I had to tell my cousin, who had been helping me out, that her CV was not going to get us funding. It's definitely true that backers will go for an A team with a B idea but never a B team with an A idea. </p> <p>\"But it is a catch 22 situation - you can't get people without funding, but you can't get funding without the people there in the first place.\" </p> <p>But most important is the guiding hand of someone used to toughing out hard times in business: \"It has been a constantly changing dynamic, like a box of puzzle pieces which keep changing size. It is exhilarating when people promise money or support, but when that then fails to materialise quickly, or at all, the lows are really low. Having Graham around has helped me put it all into perspective.\" </p> <p>She would now offer two main pieces of advice to an internet startee: ensure that one of the first members of staff taken on is a technology expert: \"I tried to launch without this and failed. I now have a person who has 20 years' experience,\" she adds. </p> <p>Secondly, find a mentor and get them on board as a non-executive director. \"It helps to have contacts, but it is far more helpful to have advice and cheerleaders.\"</p> <p><strong>Windows of opportunity: why even Bill Gates may face an age-old problem in his 30s</strong> </p> <p>Ageism is rife in the IT sector despite huge skills shortages, says a new survey by the Employers' Forum on Age, writes Liz Stuart . Although 65% of the 1,400 IT professionals questioned said their company finds it difficult to recruit staff, more companies are refusing to take on older people, many of whom have the necessary skills. More than four in five thought the government should do more to stop ageism in the workplace. </p> <p>Sam Mercer, campaign director of the EFA, says the research also shows that 88% of people said mixed-aged teams work better than teams comprised solely of younger workers. \"The IT industry is particularly guilty of ageism. An article in a computer trade magazine said all employees over 50 should be sacked because they do not have the right skills, but our survey refutes that.</p> <p>\"The government's immigration initiative could help to close this skills gap but it's not enough on its own. If the government and IT industry are serious about addressing skills shortages they should work towards changing a culture undervaluing the contribution of employees as young as 35.\"</p> <p>The research also showed an alarming definition of the term \"older\": 21% thought an employee is an older worker by the age of 35, which would put Bill Gates in this category.</p>",

Although she has been a management consultant - with US group Marakon, working both in the States and the UK, and writing the business model should not have been a problem, she found herself proposing ideas which, as a consultant, she would have pooh-poohed. \"It's amazing, now that I'm on my own, how much self-doubt creeps in and how excited I am when someone thinks what I'm doing is a good idea. Also, I did not go to business school, which is where I think the majority of strong networks are built. \"When you start out there are plenty of cynics, the kind of people who have just got their MBA and need to prove that they know more about the internet than you. They just want to rain on your parade and you need to be able to spot that. \"But what you really need is people who know a lot and will be able to criticise, but their criticism will be constructive.\" She adds that Mr Woolley's involvement also encouraged backers. \"I had to tell my cousin, who had been helping me out, that her CV was not going to get us funding. It's definitely true that backers will go for an A team with a B idea but never a B team with an A idea. \"But it is a catch 22 situation - you can't get people without funding, but you can't get funding without the people there in the first place.\" But most important is the guiding hand of someone used to toughing out hard times in business: \"It has been a constantly changing dynamic, like a box of puzzle pieces which keep changing size. It is exhilarating when people promise money or support, but when that then fails to materialise quickly, or at all, the lows are really low. Having Graham around has helped me put it all into perspective.\" She would now offer two main pieces of advice to an internet startee: ensure that one of the first members of staff taken on is a technology expert: \"I tried to launch without this and failed. I now have a person who has 20 years' experience,\" she adds. Secondly, find a mentor and get them on board as a non-executive director. \"It helps to have contacts, but it is far more helpful to have advice and cheerleaders.\" Windows of opportunity: why even Bill Gates may face an age-old problem in his 30s Ageism is rife in the IT sector despite huge skills shortages, says a new survey by the Employers' Forum on Age, writes Liz Stuart . Although 65% of the 1,400 IT professionals questioned said their company finds it difficult to recruit staff, more companies are refusing to take on older people, many of whom have the necessary skills. More than four in five thought the government should do more to stop ageism in the workplace. Sam Mercer, campaign director of the EFA, says the research also shows that 88% of people said mixed-aged teams work better than teams comprised solely of younger workers. \"The IT industry is particularly guilty of ageism. An article in a computer trade magazine said all employees over 50 should be sacked because they do not have the right skills, but our survey refutes that. \"The government's immigration initiative could help to close this skills gap but it's not enough on its own. If the government and IT industry are serious about addressing skills shortages they should work towards changing a culture undervaluing the contribution of employees as young as 35.\" The research also showed an alarming definition of the term \"older\": 21% thought an employee is an older worker by the age of 35, which would put Bill Gates in this category.",

The Guardian has learned that evidence the MoD wants heard behind closed doors includes everything relating to \"damage assessments\" it made of the Irish War written by Tony Geraghty and published in 1998. Lieutenant Nigel Wylde is charged under the Official Secrets Act of passing information to Mr Geraghty. MoD officials have told Lt Col Wylde that its damage assessments must be heard in secret \"for reasons of national security\". However, it is understood that the MoD's initial damage assessment concluded that the book did not endanger lives or military operations. The book describes the growing use of computers by military intelligence in identifying targets, including automatic photographing of vehicle registration plates. The systems \"provide total cover of a largely innocent population,\" Mr Geraghty wrote. Lt Col Wylde and Mr Geraghty were charged in 1999. Charges against Mr Geraghty were dropped last December.

Months before the link between BSE and human vCJD was admitted, when ministers were still trying to sustain confidence in the beef industry, Mr Dorrell had said there was \"no conceivable risk\" from eating British beef. Yesterday he said: \"The question about conceivable risk was that it was my phrase. I have responsibility for that and I regret having made that statement. But the broader scientific advice coming to the government at that time was advice made in good faith by the relevant advisory body.\" As the contrite Mr Dorrell surfaced on Radio 4's Today programme, ministers signalled their determination to use Lord Phillips's report on the BSE crisis to create a far more open climate for \"mature debate\" on policy options and scientific advice in Whitehall. But their aims are doomed to disappoint freedom of information campaigners as not going far enough in giving electors the full picture. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, has asked for the names of officials involved in the policy-making. But he regards institutional failures as being more important than the \"blame game\" mistakes of individuals. His priority in the months ahead is to replace the old paternalism which allowed officials to decide what should be put in the public domain with a system which gives voters and the media the facts and lets them make their own assessments of the risk. Mr Brown is afraid that Lord Phillips's relatively gentle strictures on ministers and officials who made bad judgments on BSE/ vCJD will allow \"a sigh of relief to go through Whitehall and prevent progress being as fast as it should be\". Had scientific advice flowing in to ministerial offices been available earlier, it is argued, many more people would have stopped eating beef to be on the safe side. However, the government was given a boost from an unlikely source yesterday. In one of the Anglo-French beef war's rare gestures of conciliation, the authoritative daily Le Monde heaped praise on the Phillips report, saying it represented a level of government transparency and accountability all but inconceivable in France. \"What a lesson in democracy Britain has given the rest of Europe, and particularly France,\" the paper said in an editorial headlined the British Example. \"It should be hailed as a model for an investigation by a state that has committed errors and recognises it - without trying to wriggle out of its responsibilities.\" Such a report, accusing government officials of misleading the public for years, would be a long time coming in France, Le Monde said.

      "bodyText": "The Labour outsider running to become the \"backbenchers' shop steward\" at Westminster yesterday warned the government that MPs are getting fed up with ministers squabbling like prima donnas and told them to talk with \"greater frankness behind closed doors\". Andrew Mackinlay complained that failure to listen to backbenchers had contributed to Labour's inability to act decisively on issues such as the ban on hunting with dogs and compensation for ageing Japanese POWs - causing huge frustration around the Commons. \"If you had had a greater frankness behind closed doors we might have avoided the 75p [a week increase] pensions fiasco which was not only wrong in terms of fairness to pensioners, but was also politically maladroit,\" said Mr Mackinlay. The MP for Thurrock who is challenging Clive Soley for the influential post of chairman of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) laid out his stall in an interview with the www.ePolitix.com website three weeks before the expected contest. Mr Mackinlay, a pugnacious and outspoken MP since 1992, also argued that since prime ministers are becoming more presidential, political parties needed tough \"caucus leaders\" who could stand up to them. Mr Soley, who has been PLP chairman since Labour came to power in 1997, has been criticised for being too much Downing Street's man on the backbenches rather than a strong conduit for backbench MPs' views. His job is also being stalked by ex-ministers Nigel Griffiths and Tony Lloyd. Mr Mackinlay will be attacked by his rivals as too confrontational in his likely dealings with Tony Blair, \"too much like Marcus Fox\", as some MPs put it, a reference to the former chairman of the backbench Tory 1922 committee who enjoyed popping up on TV to report what he had just told John Major. Yesterday Mr Mackinlay, 51, a former local government officer, said Mr Soley, a former probation officer, had been wrong to show a public preference for one candidate in the election of Speaker of the Commons, let alone for Sir George Young, a former Tory minister who had been in charge of rail privatisation. \"I am getting considerable support,\" he said. \"I have always been known for my candour.\" In a sideswipe at the Geoffrey Robinson-Peter Mandelson row he also condemned \"ministers who spin against one another and write books. They are seen as prima donnas\".",

Investigations into the death of a 74-year-old man last year had concluded that he, too, was a victim of vCJD - news that could lead to a fundamental reassessment of the disease. No wonder then that Mr Brown announced that the government was already \"commissioning an independent assessment of current scientific understanding of the disease, including emerging findings, on the origins of the BSE epidemic\". Behind that flat matter-of-fact announcement was a worrying realisation that the Phillips inquiry belief that BSE could have been in cows since the early 1970s - at least three cycles of the infection before it burst in its full horror on to Britain's dairy farms - would mean scientists would have to think yet again about all the potential risks to human health.

A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Blair believed that the industry was doing the best it could in difficult circumstances.

      "bodyText": "Ending a fortnight of court drama that has riveted and revolted France, a court in Saint-Omer sentenced two middle-aged brothers to life yesterday imprisonment yesterday for kidnapping, raping and murdering four teenage girls The jury found Jean-Louis and Jean-Michel Jourdain, scrap merchants dubbed \"the carnival killers\", guilty of beating, sexually assaulting and strangling to death two pairs of sisters, Audrey and Isabelle Rufin and Am\u00e9lie and Peggy Merlin, in February 1997. \"You are the Siamese twins of horror,\" the public prosecutor, Luc Fr\u00e9mio, said. \"You have sickened us. You have made me afraid. You are the dark side of humanity. You are our failure.\" Mr Fr\u00e9miot described how the brothers - both with previous convictions, one for rape, the other for murder and attempted murder - gave the four girls, aged 17 to 19, a lift in their decrepit van as they headed for a carnival in Portel, near Boulogne. Their bodies were found six days later in the dunes at Saint-Omer, still wearing their makeup and fancy-dress. They had been buried face down in shallow graves, at least one while alive. Jean-Louis, 41, said Jean-Michel took away the first girl and returned alone 20 minutes later for another. He said: \"The little one, the one in red, was crying. She clung to her sister till she, too, was led away.\" Jean-Louis admitted only having raped one girl and helped his brother bury all four.

It emerged yesterday that Mr Elstein was asked to leave the company earlier this week amid boardroom tensions with executives from Channel 5's parent company RTL. Staff at the channel were said to be shocked by the news which was announced internally at a meeting yesterday afternoon. He is walking away with a pay-off of around \u00a33m. Mr Elstein will be replaced by Channel 5's director of programming, Dawn Airey, who has been in large part responsible for winning the broadcaster the sobriquet of \"Channel Filth.\" Mr Elstein has taken the brunt of press criticism over programming which some thought plumbed new depths with a game show fronted by a naked Keith Chegwin. Ms Airey, 40, is understood to have recently been approached with job offers from rival broadcasters and sources said RTL was keen to keep her at Channel 5 by rewarding her with the top job. A spokesman for RTL said \"it had simply been time for a change\", adding that the description of Mr Elstein's departure as a sacking would be a harsh interpretation.

A lot of people looked up to him because he was so knowledgeable, but took the time to explain any aspect of Hinduism. \"Harish bridged that gap between old and young Hindus. Sometimes it was like a one man show in Leicester, he didn't get the support.\"",

He called for today's poll to be followed quickly by elections for an assembly and president - de facto independence. Richard Holbrooke, the US special envoy, said such elections would be held soon, but a UN spokeswoman said it was too early to say if they would be held in the spring. Despite the replacement of the hated Slobodan Milosevic as president of Yugoslavia by the more conciliatory Vojislav Kostunica, who called this week for the poll to be postponed, the demand for independence has increased. Party political broadcasts have been unequivocal, showing footage of fleeing refugees and Serbian police entering Kosovo Albanian villages, a reminder of the events that led to Nato's intervention last year. Kosovo is still recovering from that war: many buildings in Pristina are still wrecked from the Nato bombing, there are frequent power cuts, the roads are pitted and communication is irregular. The biggest problem remains lawlessness in a country with one of the highest concentrations of guns in the world. The judicial system is biased against Serbs; crime and corruption are endemic.

To try to circumvent the boycott the UN administrator in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner, will appoint Serbs to some municipalities. There are no reliable opinion polls but Mr Rugova's LDK is forecast to emerge as the biggest party, Mr Thaci's PDK second and Ramush Haradinaj's AAK (Alliance for the Future of Kosovo), also pro-independence, third. There is little difference between their programmes, most of the debate focusing on their roles in the past 10 years: Mr Thaci argues that his military option was more successful than Mr Rugova's passive resistance.",

      "body": "<b>The facts </b> <p> Mark Burman is a 29-year-old senior scientific researcher living in London, in a quandary about what to do with investments and endowments. </p> <p>He has been working full time since he graduated in 1991 and now earns around \u00a329,000. His major outgoings are his social life, holidays and his car. \"I basically want to have enough money to allow me to do what I want to do.\" </p> <p>He rents, but still pays into two endowment policies (around \u00a3100 a month in total) with a current value of \u00a38,000, hangovers from two previous flats he owned in Leeds. He has a company pension with his present job and transferred a sum from his previous employer's scheme, giving him around four years of contributions. </p> <p> Savings total \u00a36,000 plus \"a few\" shares from this and his previous employment packages. He does not currently hold any Isas, Peps or Tessas. </p> <p>His sole debt is a car loan taken out 18 months ago, on which he pays 9% a month, or \u00a3120, although he never pays off his credit card in full, a NatWest combined Visa and Mastercard, with a rate of 19.4%. He currently owes \u00a3600 on this. </p> <p>He has three current accounts, one of which he opened recently to operate as a share buying fund. \"I would put a percentage of money at risk, but I can't afford to lose much,\" he says, adding that he would like investments to be in fairly liquid form and would expect to tie up money for around five years. </p> <p>He would like to get rid of the endowment policies and put the money into an Isa instead: \"I think I would get a better return.\" He would also like to find a financial adviser to manage a small share portfolio. </p> <p><b>The solution</b></p> <p>Many people think that the tax breaks on an Isa are better than an endowment, but the tax credits on an Isa are equal to only about 0.25% for a basic rate payer, which may mean he is better off keeping the endowment. </p> <p>By trading it in, he could indeed invest the proceeds into an Isa, but that would mean him using up his Isa allowance. Keeping the endowment he would not only be keeping an investment free of capital gains and income tax, but also keep the life cover element of his policy, which could be useful if he decides to buy another property.</p> <p>He has some shares from his previous and current employers which could potentaily be wrapped in an Isa. He also has \u00a36,000 in cash savings, \u00a33,000 of which could be put into a cash Isa, where they would earn a better rate. The remainder of the money could be used to pay off his credit card, leaving \u00a32,400 for \"rainy day\" cash.</p> <p>He says he wants to invest small sums of money in the stock market and is looking for a broker to do this for him, but given the small amounts involved it is very unlikely he would find anyone to manage his portfolio. The best idea would be to look at a share dealing service on the internet.</p> <p>There are other considerations, too. He has a very expensive credit card and he may be better considering one of the cheaper cards, such as Egg, RBS Advanta and Cahoot.</p> <p>And his pension could be looked at. Given that he is not saving for a house and has few committments at the moment, now would be an ideal time to look at his pension as the more you invest and the earlier you invest it, the better.</p> <p>He should be investing at least 10% of his salary (including his employer's contributions), particularly as this is the most tax efficient way of saving for the future.</p> <p><b>Ray Boulger</b><br> Senior manager,<br> Charcol IFA </p> <p>\u0095 If you are 18-30, working and want advice on managing your money, e-mail <a href=\"mailto:jobs.and.money@theguardian.com\" target=\"_new\">jobs.and.money@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The facts Mark Burman is a 29-year-old senior scientific researcher living in London, in a quandary about what to do with investments and endowments. He has been working full time since he graduated in 1991 and now earns around \u00a329,000. His major outgoings are his social life, holidays and his car. \"I basically want to have enough money to allow me to do what I want to do.\" He rents, but still pays into two endowment policies (around \u00a3100 a month in total) with a current value of \u00a38,000, hangovers from two previous flats he owned in Leeds. He has a company pension with his present job and transferred a sum from his previous employer's scheme, giving him around four years of contributions. Savings total \u00a36,000 plus \"a few\" shares from this and his previous employment packages. He does not currently hold any Isas, Peps or Tessas. His sole debt is a car loan taken out 18 months ago, on which he pays 9% a month, or \u00a3120, although he never pays off his credit card in full, a NatWest combined Visa and Mastercard, with a rate of 19.4%. He currently owes \u00a3600 on this. He has three current accounts, one of which he opened recently to operate as a share buying fund. \"I would put a percentage of money at risk, but I can't afford to lose much,\" he says, adding that he would like investments to be in fairly liquid form and would expect to tie up money for around five years. He would like to get rid of the endowment policies and put the money into an Isa instead: \"I think I would get a better return.\" He would also like to find a financial adviser to manage a small share portfolio. The solution Many people think that the tax breaks on an Isa are better than an endowment, but the tax credits on an Isa are equal to only about 0.25% for a basic rate payer, which may mean he is better off keeping the endowment. By trading it in, he could indeed invest the proceeds into an Isa, but that would mean him using up his Isa allowance. Keeping the endowment he would not only be keeping an investment free of capital gains and income tax, but also keep the life cover element of his policy, which could be useful if he decides to buy another property. He has some shares from his previous and current employers which could potentaily be wrapped in an Isa. He also has \u00a36,000 in cash savings, \u00a33,000 of which could be put into a cash Isa, where they would earn a better rate. The remainder of the money could be used to pay off his credit card, leaving \u00a32,400 for \"rainy day\" cash. He says he wants to invest small sums of money in the stock market and is looking for a broker to do this for him, but given the small amounts involved it is very unlikely he would find anyone to manage his portfolio. The best idea would be to look at a share dealing service on the internet. There are other considerations, too. He has a very expensive credit card and he may be better considering one of the cheaper cards, such as Egg, RBS Advanta and Cahoot. And his pension could be looked at. Given that he is not saving for a house and has few committments at the moment, now would be an ideal time to look at his pension as the more you invest and the earlier you invest it, the better. He should be investing at least 10% of his salary (including his employer's contributions), particularly as this is the most tax efficient way of saving for the future.

Politicians need to learn the lessons of the commercial jungle if they are ever to gain the upper hand in the state-enterprise struggle. </p> <p>Dazzled by the windfalls accruing to the British and German state finances, the Italian government chose an auction process in an attempt to maximise revenues from the sale of licences for third-generation mobile operation. In a lather of excitement about the business to be gained from 3G technology, such as the market in text messaging, the telecoms groups collectively bid \u00a322.5bn for the five UK licences. In Germany the bids totalled a third as much again. </p> <p>I admit to being something of a luddite. The only text message I have received on my mobile came from BT Cellnet, offering me, as a \"valued customer\", a free handset upgrade. Needless to say I took them up on this no-strings offer - primarily because I could not understand how it represented good business. </p> <p>Even allowing for my reactionary response to new technology, I cannot see the text-to-mobile or mobile internet revolution justifying the valuations placed on 3G licences: \u00a322.5bn represents around \u00a3380 for every man, woman, child and baby in Britain - and that is before taking into account the cost of operating a network. It is telling that the heaviest users of text messaging are school children - they understand that a message can be sent at a fraction of the cost of a voice call. </p> <p>The UK licence auction raised five times original estimates. The chancellor - already perched on a healthy public purse - has refused to be seduced by unsolicited suggestions regarding spending this windfall. </p> <p>The Italians, by contrast, have a public debt mountain that must be dramatically reduced - at least if the Maastricht criteria are to be taken seriously. It has always been clear what Italy intended to do with its 3G licence fees. </p> <p>What the Italians failed to allow for was the ability of the potential bidders to learn from past experience. The British auction succeeded - from the government's perspective - because 13 bidders lined up at the outset for the five licences, and because none of the participants had any experience. In the intervening months investors and analysts have questioned the wisdom behind the prices paid for licences. Balance sheets have become stretched. Telecoms share prices have tumbled, reducing the ability of successful bidders to restructure their finances. The game, in short, has changed. </p> <p>Only six bidders lined up for the Italian auction of five licences. One of those, Blu, was an uneasy consortium led by motorway operator Autostrade, with our own BT as a minority shareholder but majority provider of telecoms expertise.

The Blu consortium folded its hand, choosing instead to indulge in an unseemly round of mutual recriminations. The Italian government was left with five bidders for five licences, raising a total of only \u00a38bn, or around half the government's publicly stated expectation. That is about \u00a3140 per head of Europe's most mobile-enthusiastic population - and only 35% of the UK take. </p> <p>Whatever governments throw at them, companies invariably find ways of maximising commercial opportunities.

However, privatisation carries the risk that a commercial business focus undermines public service; in the case of rail, not only in safety but also in breadth of service and return to the exchequer.

Even after the country was placed under a 14-hour curfew last Sunday, many people still complained angrily that they had not been counted. There are suspicions that the the official body-counters may have been too busy plumping the population figures to visit every house. According to unofficial estimates released yesterday, the population is rising far faster than expected. A 1997 census counted 62.8m people. This week the figure rose dramatically to 71.2m - at least 5m more than the experts had predicted. Many of those experts now suspect foul play. And it seems they are right. In some areas where big increases were recorded the census-takers apparently listed the names of those buried in local cemeteries in an attempt to boost their figures. \"They even counted the gravestones\", exclaimed the headline in one newspaper. \"Unfortunately, this is true,\" said Sefik Yildizeli, head of the state statistics institute. \"Officials are currently inspecting the numbers.\" The cause of the excessive enthusiasm is pretty simple. The census findings determine how much money each local authority gets from the central government to provide municipal services. They also determine how many members of parliament each district is allowed. Power, influence, and lots of cash are at stake. As a result, there were competing claims on people's residential loyalties in the run-up to census day. Some large municipalities, including Istanbul and Ankara, threatened their residents with \"dire consequences\" if they returned to their home towns or villages for the census weekend, which some were offered enticements to do. Many Turks thought the idea of imposing a curfew during the count was absurd; it was seen as yet another example of the authoritarian tendencies that linger in some state institutions. In the central city of Sivas, for example, prosecutors are seeking prison sentences for 51 people who broke curfew, including seven schoolchildren who went outside to play football. Some of the 43 questions on the census form have also been criticised - one asked women over the age of 12 how many miscarriages they had had. The government insists that a regular census is a necessary evil in a country with huge internal migration. But it has promised that things will change. A new computerised system will be introduced, and this census, they say, will be the last held under curfew. In some districts the very thought will have them turning in their graves.",

This widely valid generalisation was notably challenged by Mireille Johnston, the French/American cook, author, scholar and television presenter, who has died aged 65. Her distinction lay not so much in her books as in the totality of her life.</p> <p>She was born Mireille Busticaccia, the only child of a successful importer-exporter, in a house on the old promenade des Angles in Nice: \"A tall, apricot-coloured house with green shutters overlooking the sea,\" she began her first cookery book. \"We were constantly sent to the seashore, the garden or the hills to find ingredients for the kitchen\".</p> <p>This idyllic childhood was shattered by the second world war. The family home was blown up by the Germans, and Mireille's father became a key member of the Marseilles resistance. Part of her bilingual education took place in an English board- ing school. She returned to France after the war to study in Aix-en-Provence, and was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study American Indian civilisation at Oberlin College, Ohio.</p> <p>A woman of extraordinary intelligence, modesty, beauty and charm, Mireille wore her PhD as lightly as anyone I have met. Thus, she was admirably suited for her tour de force, the 12-part BBC2 series, A Cook's Tour Of France. Recorded in 1992 and 1993, it did not have to be formulated as light entertainment, and so her interviews with chefs and artisanal food producers were conducted in French and broadcast with English subtitles. This made it possible for Mireille to converse fluently on camera with some of the most distinguished names in contemporary French cuisine, including Paul Bocuse, Andr\u00e9 Daguin, Joel Robuchon and Lulu Peyraud.</p> <p>The format and content were worked out in collaboration with further education producer Clare Brigstocke. Mireille was able to establish in a few words the distinctive cultural identity of each locale, with the help of music related directly to the scenes it accompanied. The series has recently been rebroadcast on BBC Choice; it is a timeless document that should be available on DVD.</p> <p>Mireille came to food by way of an academic career and political activism. Both activities were encouraged by her husband, Thomas Johnston, whom she met in 1958. They were married within a year, and pursued their academic qualifications at Yale, and then their careers, in parallel. After gaining her doctorate in comparative literature, Mireille taught successively at Yale, Sarah Lawrence College and Columbia University. She also became a civil rights protester.</p> <p>Tom, in the meantime, was beginning his own career as a documentary film-maker. This took them both to New York, where his work brought him into contact with the Kennedy family. In 1964, he took charge of Robert Kennedy's senatorial office, and four years later became his presidential campaign manager. Mireille was thus introduced to world leaders, such as President Mitterrand, and to many of America's leading intellectuals, including Norman Mailer, Jules Feiffer, Pierre Salinger, and Random House Publisher Jason Epstein.</p> <p>The fact that Mireille was a polished hostess and able cook did not go unnoticed, and it was Epstein who commissioned her first book, Cuisine Of The Sun: Classical Dishes From Nice And France (1976). This and her subsequent book, The Cuisine Of The Rose (1982), were both designed by Milton Glaser, another dinner companion. Mireille's Complete French Cookery Course (1992-4) was based on her television series. Her books contain highly personal versions of classical French recipes, but her departures from tradition are conscientiously noted.</p> <p>In 1972, Mireille translated into English the transcript of Marcel Ophuls's remarkable four-hour documentary on occupied France, The Sorrow And The Pity. When I spoke with her last May, she explained that her work on the film had been a tribute to her father, Jean, who had been disgusted at the number of known collaborators who, after the war, claimed to have remained loyal to France.</p> <p>Inheriting from her father this sense of social justice, Mireille remained a dedicated and active socialist. Once back in France, she joined the Socialist party and demonstrated against Le Pen and the National Front. Her translation for the film, together with biographical and appendix material, was published in Britain in 1975.</p> <p>Mireille brought to her life's work all that she had received through her father's Italianate family, conditioned and enriched by her Nicean upbringing. The result was a cultural blend as complex, yet coherent, as the cuisine which she so ably practised and presented.</p> <p>She is survived by her husband and her two daughters.</p> <p>\u0095 Mireille Johnston, cook, writer, television presenter and translator, born October 4 1935; died October 5 2000</p>",

Her distinction lay not so much in her books as in the totality of her life. She was born Mireille Busticaccia, the only child of a successful importer-exporter, in a house on the old promenade des Angles in Nice: \"A tall, apricot-coloured house with green shutters overlooking the sea,\" she began her first cookery book. \"We were constantly sent to the seashore, the garden or the hills to find ingredients for the kitchen\". This idyllic childhood was shattered by the second world war. The family home was blown up by the Germans, and Mireille's father became a key member of the Marseilles resistance. Part of her bilingual education took place in an English board- ing school. She returned to France after the war to study in Aix-en-Provence, and was awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study American Indian civilisation at Oberlin College, Ohio. A woman of extraordinary intelligence, modesty, beauty and charm, Mireille wore her PhD as lightly as anyone I have met. Thus, she was admirably suited for her tour de force, the 12-part BBC2 series, A Cook's Tour Of France. Recorded in 1992 and 1993, it did not have to be formulated as light entertainment, and so her interviews with chefs and artisanal food producers were conducted in French and broadcast with English subtitles. This made it possible for Mireille to converse fluently on camera with some of the most distinguished names in contemporary French cuisine, including Paul Bocuse, Andr\u00e9 Daguin, Joel Robuchon and Lulu Peyraud. The format and content were worked out in collaboration with further education producer Clare Brigstocke. Mireille was able to establish in a few words the distinctive cultural identity of each locale, with the help of music related directly to the scenes it accompanied. The series has recently been rebroadcast on BBC Choice; it is a timeless document that should be available on DVD. Mireille came to food by way of an academic career and political activism. Both activities were encouraged by her husband, Thomas Johnston, whom she met in 1958. They were married within a year, and pursued their academic qualifications at Yale, and then their careers, in parallel. After gaining her doctorate in comparative literature, Mireille taught successively at Yale, Sarah Lawrence College and Columbia University. She also became a civil rights protester. Tom, in the meantime, was beginning his own career as a documentary film-maker. This took them both to New York, where his work brought him into contact with the Kennedy family. In 1964, he took charge of Robert Kennedy's senatorial office, and four years later became his presidential campaign manager. Mireille was thus introduced to world leaders, such as President Mitterrand, and to many of America's leading intellectuals, including Norman Mailer, Jules Feiffer, Pierre Salinger, and Random House Publisher Jason Epstein. The fact that Mireille was a polished hostess and able cook did not go unnoticed, and it was Epstein who commissioned her first book, Cuisine Of The Sun: Classical Dishes From Nice And France (1976). This and her subsequent book, The Cuisine Of The Rose (1982), were both designed by Milton Glaser, another dinner companion. Mireille's Complete French Cookery Course (1992-4) was based on her television series. Her books contain highly personal versions of classical French recipes, but her departures from tradition are conscientiously noted. In 1972, Mireille translated into English the transcript of Marcel Ophuls's remarkable four-hour documentary on occupied France, The Sorrow And The Pity. When I spoke with her last May, she explained that her work on the film had been a tribute to her father, Jean, who had been disgusted at the number of known collaborators who, after the war, claimed to have remained loyal to France. Inheriting from her father this sense of social justice, Mireille remained a dedicated and active socialist. Once back in France, she joined the Socialist party and demonstrated against Le Pen and the National Front. Her translation for the film, together with biographical and appendix material, was published in Britain in 1975. Mireille brought to her life's work all that she had received through her father's Italianate family, conditioned and enriched by her Nicean upbringing. The result was a cultural blend as complex, yet coherent, as the cuisine which she so ably practised and presented. She is survived by her husband and her two daughters. \u0095 Mireille Johnston, cook, writer, television presenter and translator, born October 4 1935; died October 5 2000",

      "byline": "Ian Mayes",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Even if you are not an aficionado of the internet you will have noticed increasing references to websites in the Guardian in the form of short lists of links provided at the end of features and reports. These are designed to encourage readers of the paper to use the freedom of the net to get a broader or deeper view of the subject dealt with in our own version. But how much freedom should the Guardian be encouraging its readers to enjoy? </p> <p>Should we provide links to, say, Hamas, which describes itself as the Islamic resistance movement, or to the website of the Guardian's closest rival, the Independent? We have done both of those things in the past few days and both attracted protests. </p> <p>The Hamas link drew strong complaints from outside the paper, chastising us for linking to a \"terrorist\" organisation, or for not making clear enough to what we were linking. (There was a flurry of calls within the space of half an hour, one caller mistaking the recipient and asking why the BBC, rather than the Guardian, was linking to Hamas, suggesting perhaps that a lobby was at work.) </p> <p>Complaints about links to the website of the Independent came from inside the paper, arguing that linking to routine coverage in a rival newspaper was demoralising for the authors of the equivalent pieces in the Guardian. </p> <p>The editor of Guardian Unlimited, our website, resisted the complaints about the Hamas link. The link was offered at the end of a report on Israel and the Middle East by the former editor of the Guardian, Peter Preston. </p> <p>In the printed version only the writer's email address was provided. In the web version the Hamas link was one of seven provided at the end of the piece. The others offered access to the offices of Madeleine Albright, Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak; and to the websites of the Israeli government, the Palestinian National Authority and the Egyptian presidency. If you have internet access you may still read the piece in the archive, explore the links and reach your own conclusion. </p> <p>When the editor of the website asked the editor of the Guardian for an opinion, the latter replied, \"I think I'm relaxed about the link. We were, as a paper, against the broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, believing that the battle for ideas needs to be fought in the open. I think the vast majority of people reading Peter Preston's column would be perfectly aware of what Hamas was. In a Spanish context, it would be interesting to read the Herri Batasuna site, now under construction, better to understand the political aims behind Eta.\" [Herri Batasuna is the political wing of the armed Eta movement.] </p> <p>We have run over some of the ground before in this column (Click here for free speech: links to controversial websites, February 13 1999). One of the important considerations is the context in which a link is made. In this case the Hamas site was in the company of other links offering the broadest possible access to views in the debate. Whether some additional flagging should have been offered, other than the one-word link \"Hamas\", is open to debate. On other parts of the website efforts are being made to develop a vocabulary of signals, and it might have appeared, for example, as \"Key player: Hamas\". </p> <p>It is also important to see this point in the context of the whole coverage of the Middle East on the Guardian website. This is widely admired, a fact of which I was reminded when I noticed that the website of Rai, the Italian state broadcasting service, was directing attention to the Guardian's website among the links it offered on the Middle East. </p> <p>Careful consideration is given to the provision of links. The freedom of the net is not, the editor of the Guardian believes, to be restricted lightly. \"If CP Scott [the famous former editor] were alive today he would say, 'What an amazing medium'.\" He quoted from CP Scott's own words in his introduction to the American edition of The Manchester Guardian by William Haslam Mills, 1922, and his enthusiastic espousal of the technological advances of his own day. \"The world is shrinking. Space is every day being bridged. Already we can telegraph through the air or the ether, from Penzance to Melbourne, and tomorrow we shall be able to talk by the same mechanism. Physical boundaries are disappearing; moral boundaries must speedily follow suit... What a change for the world! What a chance for a newspaper.\" </p> <p>To return to the matter of linking to the Independent, or other newspaper sites. Guidelines have now been formulated that should avoid the risk of appearing either to undervalue the Guardian's own material or to be linking on a whim, without, it is to be hoped, detracting from the spirit of free inquiry. </p> <p>\u0095 You may comment on the links provided at the end of reports in the newspaper to ben.summers@theguardian.com Comments on the Newslist (which sometimes links to other papers) to gwyn.topham@theguardian.com The editor of Guardian Unlimited can also be emailed: <a href=\"mailto:david.rowan@theguardian.com\"> david.rowan@theguardian.com</a>.<br> \u0095 Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning 020-7239 9589 between 11am and 5pm Monday to Friday.

      "bodyText": "Even if you are not an aficionado of the internet you will have noticed increasing references to websites in the Guardian in the form of short lists of links provided at the end of features and reports. These are designed to encourage readers of the paper to use the freedom of the net to get a broader or deeper view of the subject dealt with in our own version. But how much freedom should the Guardian be encouraging its readers to enjoy? Should we provide links to, say, Hamas, which describes itself as the Islamic resistance movement, or to the website of the Guardian's closest rival, the Independent? We have done both of those things in the past few days and both attracted protests. The Hamas link drew strong complaints from outside the paper, chastising us for linking to a \"terrorist\" organisation, or for not making clear enough to what we were linking. (There was a flurry of calls within the space of half an hour, one caller mistaking the recipient and asking why the BBC, rather than the Guardian, was linking to Hamas, suggesting perhaps that a lobby was at work.) Complaints about links to the website of the Independent came from inside the paper, arguing that linking to routine coverage in a rival newspaper was demoralising for the authors of the equivalent pieces in the Guardian. The editor of Guardian Unlimited, our website, resisted the complaints about the Hamas link. The link was offered at the end of a report on Israel and the Middle East by the former editor of the Guardian, Peter Preston. In the printed version only the writer's email address was provided. In the web version the Hamas link was one of seven provided at the end of the piece. The others offered access to the offices of Madeleine Albright, Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak; and to the websites of the Israeli government, the Palestinian National Authority and the Egyptian presidency. If you have internet access you may still read the piece in the archive, explore the links and reach your own conclusion. When the editor of the website asked the editor of the Guardian for an opinion, the latter replied, \"I think I'm relaxed about the link. We were, as a paper, against the broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, believing that the battle for ideas needs to be fought in the open. I think the vast majority of people reading Peter Preston's column would be perfectly aware of what Hamas was. In a Spanish context, it would be interesting to read the Herri Batasuna site, now under construction, better to understand the political aims behind Eta.\" [Herri Batasuna is the political wing of the armed Eta movement.] We have run over some of the ground before in this column (Click here for free speech: links to controversial websites, February 13 1999). One of the important considerations is the context in which a link is made. In this case the Hamas site was in the company of other links offering the broadest possible access to views in the debate. Whether some additional flagging should have been offered, other than the one-word link \"Hamas\", is open to debate. On other parts of the website efforts are being made to develop a vocabulary of signals, and it might have appeared, for example, as \"Key player: Hamas\". It is also important to see this point in the context of the whole coverage of the Middle East on the Guardian website. This is widely admired, a fact of which I was reminded when I noticed that the website of Rai, the Italian state broadcasting service, was directing attention to the Guardian's website among the links it offered on the Middle East. Careful consideration is given to the provision of links. The freedom of the net is not, the editor of the Guardian believes, to be restricted lightly. \"If CP Scott [the famous former editor] were alive today he would say, 'What an amazing medium'.\" He quoted from CP Scott's own words in his introduction to the American edition of The Manchester Guardian by William Haslam Mills, 1922, and his enthusiastic espousal of the technological advances of his own day. \"The world is shrinking. Space is every day being bridged. Already we can telegraph through the air or the ether, from Penzance to Melbourne, and tomorrow we shall be able to talk by the same mechanism. Physical boundaries are disappearing; moral boundaries must speedily follow suit... What a change for the world! What a chance for a newspaper.\" To return to the matter of linking to the Independent, or other newspaper sites. Guidelines have now been formulated that should avoid the risk of appearing either to undervalue the Guardian's own material or to be linking on a whim, without, it is to be hoped, detracting from the spirit of free inquiry. \u0095 You may comment on the links provided at the end of reports in the newspaper to ben.summers@theguardian.com Comments on the Newslist (which sometimes links to other papers) to gwyn.topham@theguardian.com The editor of Guardian Unlimited can also be emailed: david.rowan@theguardian.com. \u0095 Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning 020-7239 9589 between 11am and 5pm Monday to Friday.

The pantomime horse catches you by surprise. The figures inside the soft brown costume are so perfectly lifesize, it's hard to shake the idea there really are people inside. </p> <p>Then you do a double-take. The figure in the rear end of the pantomime horse is standing upright, thrusting its pelvis against the backside of the figure in front. Something very lewd appears to be going on. The horse's tail stands pertly upright and the horse is grinning.

The pantomime horse catches you by surprise. The figures inside the soft brown costume are so perfectly lifesize, it's hard to shake the idea there really are people inside. Then you do a double-take. The figure in the rear end of the pantomime horse is standing upright, thrusting its pelvis against the backside of the figure in front. Something very lewd appears to be going on. The horse's tail stands pertly upright and the horse is grinning. The title on the wall nearby says: \"Oh no he isn't, oh yes he is.\" Wallinger's art uses everyday, prosaic materials and yet its intentions are nothing short of visionary.

      "body": "<p>The Wexford Festival has become all too predictable over the past six years. Under the artistic directorship of Luigi Ferrari, whose day job now is running the Teatro Communale in Bologna, the repertoire has narrowed: anything written earlier than 1800 or after 1920 appears to be out. Indeed, Ferrari is on record as saying opera \"died\" at the beginning of the 20th century. </p> <p>The products of Italian verismo, however minor, are definitely in, though - apparently chosen almost at random, as if Ferrari had just stuck a pin in a publisher's catalogue and programmed whatever he impaled. There could be no other explanation for the inclusion of Riccardo Zandonai's Conchita in this year's triptych of productions - a profoundly unsavoury story, first seen in 1911, that wanly attempts to capitalise on the popularity of Bizet's Carmen, and is set to music of total vacuity. It is hard to believe that anyone with the faintest glimmer of musical intelligence could have believed that Conchita was worth hearing again: neglected operas are sometimes neglected for the very good reason that they are rubbish. </p> <p>The other works this time, though, are worthwhile. In reviving Tchaikovsky's Orleanskaya Deva (The Maid of Orleans) and Adolphe Adam's Si J'Etais Roi, the festival is continuing to fulfil the role that made it an important fixture in the operatic calendar from the 1950s onwards, giving audiences a chance to evaluate scores that have either become unfashionable (the Adam) or overshadowed by greater stage works by the same composer (The Maid of Orleans). </p> <p>If Tchaikovsky had not produced two blazing masterpieces in Eugene Onegin and The Queen of Spades, The Maid of Orleans would probably not be the forgotten score it is. The libretto is based upon Schiller's play about Joan of Arc, and though the four acts sprawl a bit (the Wexford performances are tactfully cut), there is more good music than bad. Some of it, especially the set pieces for Joan, is very clearly the work of a great composer. As always Tchaikovsky's dramatic juices flow most copiously when he has a female character to whom he can respond, and in Joan's conflict between her mission to save France from the English and her love for the Burgundian knight Lionel, he found the resonance he wanted. </p> <p>Si J'Etais Roi is a very different operatic animal, an op\u00e9ra comique first seen in Paris in 1852, which takes a story from the Arabian Nights and, for no obvious reason, relocates it to Goa. A young fisherman saves a mysterious young woman from drowning (and, as the programme puts it, manages to \"lay her, still unconscious, on the sand\"). Without knowing that she is a princess, he falls in love, and is transformed into a king for a day; finally everyone lives happily ever after. It's frothy, make-believe stuff, carried along by its unabashed good humour and a wealth of fine (if never very memorable) tunes. Adam's music is wonderfully polished: his scoring is deft, his vocal writing brilliant; he was obviously a consummate professional who knew exactly what his singers needed. And here the score gets the kind of punchy presentation it needs, with an outstanding perfor mance from Iwona Hossa as the princess N\u00e9m\u00e9a (she is a coloratura soprano of whom much more will be heard) and strong, touching singing from Joseph Calleja as the fisherman Z\u00e9phoris, while David Agler in the pit keeps the score bouncing along. Musical standards at Wexford seem to be high: The Maid of Orleans is solidly cast, too, with Lada Biriucov as Joan, Igor Tarrassov as Lionel and a dark, burnished baritone Aleksander Teligar as her father Thibaut. </p> <p>But production values certainly have reached rock bottom under the present regime. While the Adam is decently enough staged by Renaud Doucet, with colourfully improbable sets and plenty of over-the-top humour, both Conchita and The Maid of Orleans are woeful, clad in dismal designs and lacking even a modicum of dramatic credi bility. The Tchaikovsky could have been a concert performance for all that the village-hall acting and costumes added to the occasion. Staging opera convincingly doesn't need more money than staging it badly, only more imagination, and that is a commodity that seems in short supply in Wexford at the moment.</p> <p>\u0095 The Wexford Festival runs until November 5.

      "body": "<p>I don't know if any of you remember that fantastic bit in the film Jackie Brown, where Bridget Fonda, playing a sexy slacker, is warned by her boyfriend as she lights up the nth joint of the day and surfs channels, \"That stuff's gonna rob you of your ambition.\" Bridget giggles: \"Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV!\" </p> <p>It was a great answer, and I thought of it the other day when the usual suspects were banging on about us endangering our poor ickle kiddies by stuffing them full of junk food and leaving them to fester on the sofa. When columnists use \"us\" in this context, of course, they mean \"the working class\", but they can't say that because they're meant to be liberals and it would sound snooty. So they cover themselves in communal guilt while covertly making the best of this fine opportunity to give the proles a good kicking; yes, the paedophile protests in Portsmouth have died down, but here's another window of contempt for oiks that every good closet-patrician can access. </p> <p>I'm not so sure, myself; having grown up working class, it's struck me as I've moved up the social ladder how much more right about lots of things they instinctively are than their so-called betters - who don't even come out of full-time education until their mid-20s and spend the rest of their lives exploiting the contacts they made during it and their family connections, rather than truly making their own way in the world. If you took away their cleaners and nannies, I doubt whether these people could cope for a weekend nearly as well as numerous single parents I've known living in garden-free council flats. And yes, I am aware of how self-righteous that sounds and, no, I don't give a toss. </p> <p>Nigella Lawson and her fragrant ilk are currently berating the working-class women of Britain for condemning their kids to a life of corpulence and couch-potatory; excitable health minister, Yvette Cooper, has even more of her elastic in a twang, declaring that today's children \"may\" not live as long as their parents. But Bridget's answer rings once more in my ears; why should working-class children want to be fit? And why should they want to live until they are 90? </p> <p>Should they be fit for the soul-destroying call-centre McJobs which will be their main source of income now that traditional industry has been destroyed? Should they want to stay fit into middle-age so that they can experience being told that they are too old to hire at 55, as they have seen happen to their grandparents? And should they want to live to be old so that they can receive a 75p a week rise in their pension, find that D0 NOT RESUSCITATE is written on their hospital records and wait five years for a hip operation before dying on a trolley in the corridor of some filthy hospital? Is it any wonder that the working class often do not appear to have the same attachment to longevity as the middle class, but would rather enjoy the here and now? </p> <p>Maybe they have it right, like dogs eating grass to then attain the desired effect of making themselves sick after ingesting poison. Because whatever our class, the fact remains that those of us who do not die of heart disease, brought on by a sedentary lifestyle, will probably die of cancer, brought on by Christ knows what. In the past two years, I have seen both my parents die; my father, who was extremely fit and sporty, slowly and painfully from a type of cancer and my mother, who was extremely self-indulgent, from a heart attack in the time it took me to leave the room and make her a cup of tea. And I sure as hell know how I'd like to go. \"Five portions of fruit and veg a day!\" we chant like children afraid of the dark, convinced that this bizarre counting ritual will in some way help us. </p> <p>Alternatively, you could eat, drink and be chubby, because we're all going to die anyway. \"Gimme a pig's foot and a bottle of beer\", sang Bessie Smith, and her delight in the swinish pleasures of gluttony reflected a joie de vivre that just wouldn't be the same if we changed it to an apple and a bottle of Evian. Health is often what we obsess about the most when we lack those things which make life truly transcendent: politics, sex, God. </p> <p>Those who place too much emphasis on healthy eating display a fear of both life, in all its messiness, and death, in all its inevitability. And I've got to say that the muesli-munching middle classes, last time I looked, didn't even throw up half as many appealing physical specimens as the junk-crunching proles, from where we recruit our best examples of beauty and athleticism: Moss, Campbell, Lewis, Beckham. </p> <p> Middle-class parents may stuff their children full of fruit and veg, but they abuse them in a hundred ways completely unknown to the innocent, coronary-courting sink-estate mum, by hot-housing them academically until suicide seems a welcome option (middle-class young men aged between 18 and 25 have never killed themselves as much, often just before or after an \"important\" exam), by making them appear in self-serving TV programmes as dinky accessories to their parents' fab lifestyle, and worst of all by waving their horrible hairy scrotums in tiny children's faces in the name of (yeah, right) \"growing up with a healthy attitude to sex\". </p> <p>Among all of last week's breast-beating about the beastly proles killing their kiddies with calories, no one so much as raised an eyebrow at an excerpt from John Mortimer's forthcoming autobiography, printed in a Sunday paper: </p> <p>\"I was 62 when my daughter Rosie was born. When she was very young we were having a bath together (a fact which would lead to our immediate arrest if known to the social workers) and she suddenly said, 'I don't love you, Dad.' </p> <p>\"'That's very sad,' I told her. </p> <p>\"'Yes,' Rosie admitted, 'it's sad but it is interesting.'\" </p> <p>Such is the arrogance of the middle classes that it obviously never occurred to Mortimer that his daughter had ceased to love him because, let's face it, to be trapped in a confined space with a naked, wet, 64-year-old John Mortimer must be so unpleasant that it would feel to a small child exactly like a punishment, one that must be outlawed somewhere in the Geneva Convention - he's a lawyer, he should know. I've often thought it would be fun to be a lesbian, but such an early experience would make it practically compulsory. No, there's definitely worse things I could do than fill my teen angel up with carbos; praise the Lord and pass the chip pan.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I don't know if any of you remember that fantastic bit in the film Jackie Brown, where Bridget Fonda, playing a sexy slacker, is warned by her boyfriend as she lights up the nth joint of the day and surfs channels, \"That stuff's gonna rob you of your ambition.\" Bridget giggles: \"Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV!\" It was a great answer, and I thought of it the other day when the usual suspects were banging on about us endangering our poor ickle kiddies by stuffing them full of junk food and leaving them to fester on the sofa. When columnists use \"us\" in this context, of course, they mean \"the working class\", but they can't say that because they're meant to be liberals and it would sound snooty. So they cover themselves in communal guilt while covertly making the best of this fine opportunity to give the proles a good kicking; yes, the paedophile protests in Portsmouth have died down, but here's another window of contempt for oiks that every good closet-patrician can access. I'm not so sure, myself; having grown up working class, it's struck me as I've moved up the social ladder how much more right about lots of things they instinctively are than their so-called betters - who don't even come out of full-time education until their mid-20s and spend the rest of their lives exploiting the contacts they made during it and their family connections, rather than truly making their own way in the world. If you took away their cleaners and nannies, I doubt whether these people could cope for a weekend nearly as well as numerous single parents I've known living in garden-free council flats. And yes, I am aware of how self-righteous that sounds and, no, I don't give a toss. Nigella Lawson and her fragrant ilk are currently berating the working-class women of Britain for condemning their kids to a life of corpulence and couch-potatory; excitable health minister, Yvette Cooper, has even more of her elastic in a twang, declaring that today's children \"may\" not live as long as their parents. But Bridget's answer rings once more in my ears; why should working-class children want to be fit? And why should they want to live until they are 90? Should they be fit for the soul-destroying call-centre McJobs which will be their main source of income now that traditional industry has been destroyed? Should they want to stay fit into middle-age so that they can experience being told that they are too old to hire at 55, as they have seen happen to their grandparents? And should they want to live to be old so that they can receive a 75p a week rise in their pension, find that D0 NOT RESUSCITATE is written on their hospital records and wait five years for a hip operation before dying on a trolley in the corridor of some filthy hospital? Is it any wonder that the working class often do not appear to have the same attachment to longevity as the middle class, but would rather enjoy the here and now? Maybe they have it right, like dogs eating grass to then attain the desired effect of making themselves sick after ingesting poison. Because whatever our class, the fact remains that those of us who do not die of heart disease, brought on by a sedentary lifestyle, will probably die of cancer, brought on by Christ knows what. In the past two years, I have seen both my parents die; my father, who was extremely fit and sporty, slowly and painfully from a type of cancer and my mother, who was extremely self-indulgent, from a heart attack in the time it took me to leave the room and make her a cup of tea. And I sure as hell know how I'd like to go. \"Five portions of fruit and veg a day!\" we chant like children afraid of the dark, convinced that this bizarre counting ritual will in some way help us. Alternatively, you could eat, drink and be chubby, because we're all going to die anyway. \"Gimme a pig's foot and a bottle of beer\", sang Bessie Smith, and her delight in the swinish pleasures of gluttony reflected a joie de vivre that just wouldn't be the same if we changed it to an apple and a bottle of Evian. Health is often what we obsess about the most when we lack those things which make life truly transcendent: politics, sex, God. Those who place too much emphasis on healthy eating display a fear of both life, in all its messiness, and death, in all its inevitability. And I've got to say that the muesli-munching middle classes, last time I looked, didn't even throw up half as many appealing physical specimens as the junk-crunching proles, from where we recruit our best examples of beauty and athleticism: Moss, Campbell, Lewis, Beckham. Middle-class parents may stuff their children full of fruit and veg, but they abuse them in a hundred ways completely unknown to the innocent, coronary-courting sink-estate mum, by hot-housing them academically until suicide seems a welcome option (middle-class young men aged between 18 and 25 have never killed themselves as much, often just before or after an \"important\" exam), by making them appear in self-serving TV programmes as dinky accessories to their parents' fab lifestyle, and worst of all by waving their horrible hairy scrotums in tiny children's faces in the name of (yeah, right) \"growing up with a healthy attitude to sex\". Among all of last week's breast-beating about the beastly proles killing their kiddies with calories, no one so much as raised an eyebrow at an excerpt from John Mortimer's forthcoming autobiography, printed in a Sunday paper: \"I was 62 when my daughter Rosie was born. When she was very young we were having a bath together (a fact which would lead to our immediate arrest if known to the social workers) and she suddenly said, 'I don't love you, Dad.' \"'That's very sad,' I told her. \"'Yes,' Rosie admitted, 'it's sad but it is interesting.'\" Such is the arrogance of the middle classes that it obviously never occurred to Mortimer that his daughter had ceased to love him because, let's face it, to be trapped in a confined space with a naked, wet, 64-year-old John Mortimer must be so unpleasant that it would feel to a small child exactly like a punishment, one that must be outlawed somewhere in the Geneva Convention - he's a lawyer, he should know. I've often thought it would be fun to be a lesbian, but such an early experience would make it practically compulsory. No, there's definitely worse things I could do than fill my teen angel up with carbos; praise the Lord and pass the chip pan.",

For example, some people absolutely insist that you spread the jam to the furthest corners of the toast. Others insist on jam applied in Marmite-sized quantities. Still others insist on Marmite applied in jam-sized quantities - these people don't normally have friends who are prepared to make them toast. Cold toast is a very sad affair, and gives a small insight into death - something you've known and loved, that was warm and comforting, but that is now cold and stiff and destined for the bin. If this thought gets you down, pop in another couple of slices and smear them with half a pound of honey. It's impossible to be sad afterwards. Toasters are one of the high points in western civilisation, It's just a shame that you can't cook bigger meals such as roast beef or country chicken pie in them. The quintessence of toast is thick, white bread, well-browned but not burned, hand-crushed and then soaked in salted butter with a layer of tangy marmalade on top. That's real cooking, and is why millions of single men choose it over a lot of fancy restaurant cuisine. Unless someone else is paying.",

Except on dinner tables from Berkeley to Bermondsey, where Pacific Rim (aka, fusion) cooking may be observed in action. Like most developments in cooking, reassuringly, it isn't new at all. When 17th-century English cooks developed a craving for nutmeg from the Molucca Islands of Indonesia, they were doing fusion. So were the Indian and south-east Asian cooks who took the chilli pepper (native to Mesoamerica) to their hearts, minds and bellies from around the turn of the 16th century. </p> <p><strong> The basics</strong> </p> <p>Fusion cooking is an elusive concept, but if you want a definition, try this: cooking that freely mixes ingredients, methods and equipment from every part of the globe, with results that can't be identified with a single national cuisine. On occasion, the Knowledge wishes it had never been invented: some chefs turn their global larders into fusionistic dog's dinners. About as appetising as mouldy bread, and better described as con fusion. But when it's good, it's very, very good. And you can do it successfully in the privacy of your own home. Herewith, the Knowledge's top-10 starting-point ingredients ... </p> <p><strong> The details</strong></p> <p><strong> Fusion fodder 1: noodles</strong><br> The shapes of Asian pasta are few (basically, round or flat long noodles, a bit like vermicelli, spaghetti or linguini), but the starchy matter - hubba hubba! - is something else. It can be egg and flour, buckwheat, rice, soy beans or mung beans (as in Chinese \"cellophane\" noodles), in addition to plain old wheat flour. Japan has the greatest variety, China follows close behind. Use them as a side dish, sauced as you please. They make the best noodle soups, the best noodle salads, and the only stir-fryable noodles. </p> <p><strong> Fusion fodder 2: lemongrass</strong> <br> One of the most seductive flavours on earth. Top and tail, slip off the tough outer husk, bruise at brief intervals with the dull edge of a knife, and slice or chop for use in soups, braises, salsas or saut\u00e9s. Creamy chicken soup flavoured with lemongrass and coconut does the Pacific Rim job sensationally. </p> <p><strong> Fusion fodder 3: lime leaves</strong> <br> Lemongrass's constant companion in Thai cooking and even more extravagantly aromatic. There's almost nothing in which the Knowledge wouldn't consider using these green goddesses, but they were made for soups and sauces, shellfish and chicken in any guise, and anything with garlic. The dried version is acceptable, but fresh is best. </p> <p><strong> Fusion fodder 4: dashi</strong><br> One of the basic flavours of Japanese food. Dashi is a mixture of dried bonito and dried seaweed, reconstituted in water to make a broth of wonderfully delicate flavour. This is your friend for fused soups, sauces and gravies. Instant versions are widely available. </p> <p><strong> Fusion fodder 5: ginger</strong> <br> Will get Knowledged in full at a later date. If I had an extra page or two, a full listing of ginger's possible uses would be possible. In the meantime, consider ginger in: meatballs, burgers, braised carrots, fishcakes. </p> <p><strong> Fusion fodder 6: galangal</strong> <br> Ginger's rarer cousin. Galangal is almost chilli-hot, and has to be used in moderation; but when it's used well, watch out!</p> <p> <strong> Fusion fodder 7: Asian greens</strong> <br> The stuff called \"Chinese cabbage\" (often from Israel) is ubiquitous and okay, but a good Chinese supermarket or food shop will present you with things you've never seen before. You won't know their names, but you will fall in love when you take them home for sacrifice on the fusionistic altar. Treat them as you would spinach, celery or fennel. Braise them, steam them, stir-fry them, add them to stews for the last 15 minutes of cooking, stir them into the juices from a roast chicken or piece of pork.</p> <p> <strong> Fusion fodder 8: fish sauce</strong> <br> The odour repels some people, and why shouldn't it? Made from dried, salted fish, it smells a bit like a mackerel tail that got stuck to the side of the rubbish bin and stayed there all weekend. But used in small quantities, it makes gravy, steamed veg, potato gratins or even salad dressing zoom into the stratosphere.</p> <p> <strong> Fusion fodder 9: Chinese five-spice powder</strong> <br> A fragrant mix of star anise, cloves, cassia, fennel seeds and Sichuan peppercorns. If this stuff hadn't been invented in China, it would have been invented in Europe, so perfect is it in a multitude of western devices. In baked goods, or dusted on to a duck breast or pork chop, or in a fusionistic rice pudding or rice pilaf, and in marinades - this quintet has legs. Run with it. </p> <p><strong> Fusion fodder 10: soy sauce</strong> <br> The grandaddy of east meets west cooking and truly a case of last but not least. Soy sauce isn't just for stir-fries.

      "body": "<p>Despite having a name that inspires visions of some glamorous 40s movie star, Traci des Jardins is, in fact, one of San Francisco's hottest chefs. Her restaurant, Jardini\u00e8re, a short walk from San Francisco's City Hall, is a marked success in a city that, though it loves to eat, more often than not chews up and spits out even the most experienced of restaurateurs.</p> <p>The style and decor is laid-back California meets London's East End with a detour through New York's Tribeca, and the food wins praise all around. Being a female chef, and working on the US West Coast, one might imagine her serving what they call \"girl food\", all fussy and light, or \"California cuisine\", with fusion vinaigrettes, roasted veggie pastas and endless goat's cheese salads. But that would be wrong. With her pulled-back blonde hair, quiet voice, and serious demeanour, des Jardins heads her large team with strict but kindly professionalism.</p> <p>Named 1995 Rising Star Chef of the Year by the prestigious James Beard Foundation, the diminutive des Jardins previously ran Rubicon, a swank San Francisco restaurant owned by Francis Ford Coppola, Robert De Niro and Robin Williams. Even so, she shuns all of that fickle \"flavour of the month\" label common to so many top-class restaurants. It's an attitude that reflects a classic French training - des Jardins took the route of traditional apprenticeship, along the way working for such legendary establishments in France as Fr\u00e8res Troisgros and L'Arpege.</p> <p>Her menu, then, is built on solid foundations of classic French techniques - hearty food with a sensual nature; rather aptly, given her name, it also revolves around the freshest vegetables the local area has to offer. Risotto comes rich with sweetcorn and chanterelles, or resplendent with root vegetables; fish rests on a bed of leek pur\u00e9e and oil-crushed potatoes, and is sauced with curry-scented pumpkin; shortribs, a succulent and rich cut of beef, rests on a bed of celeriac pur\u00e9e with a salad of chanterelles and chestnuts.</p> <p>Indeed, des Jardins gathers flavours for her customers with an earnestness that is as endearing as it is demanding. She also credits them with knowing what's what. \"The more educated the palate,\" she says, \"the more willing customers are to eat, and appreciate, different and unusual offerings.\" Sure, you'll find the odd fusion vinaigrette (such as Thai vinaigrette splashed on to lobster and melon salad with fennel and tomato), but you'll also find pork chops with black-eyed peas, lamb loin with fennel-tomato confit and rosemary jus, wild salmon with fresh cranberry beans and herb pur\u00e9e - it's all classic French, yet, in the style of modern Californian cuisine, there is also a twist of flavour, a splash of surprise, a shock of something delicious and unexpected.</p> <p>But you won't find strange combinations tossed together just because they look good in menu-speak. Des Jardins is quite emphatic about this: \"Food has to have a reference, often historical, for ingredients to work together: Vietnamese and French, for instance.

To understand just how courageous this is, remember that, in California, cholesterol is a dirty word - so much so that, each time I go there, I half-expect cheese to have been outlawed. Not only does she offer a cheeseboard, she even has her own affinage room, where between 30-50 ripening cheeses loll about at just the right temperature for just the right length of time to achieve their own distinctive charm.</p> <p>\"The American palate is becoming more refined,\" explains des Jardins. \"Twenty years ago, wonderfully-roasted coffee beans, excellent bread and well-grown vegetables were a rarity; today, they are expected. The same holds true with cheese.\" And if the daring cheeseboard doesn't grab you, there is always a choice of glorious puddings: caramelised bananas atop banana ice cream and chocolate hazelnut tart; fig-pecan crumble with port ice cream; cr\u00e8me brl\u00e9e topped with blackberries ...</p> <p>Des Jardins grew up in a tiny Central Valley town, and the home table was both Spanish- and French-influenced by virtue of a Mexican mother and Louisianan father. The experience had a profound effect: \"I came to cheffing fuelled by a passion for food, simple as that,\" she says. \"I never wanted to do anything else.\"</p> <p>All recipes serve eight.</p> <p><b> AHI TUNA TARTARE NICOISE WITH POTATO AND OVEN-DRIED TOMATOES</b></p> <p>For the oven-dried tomatoes:</p> <p>450g plum tomatoes, blanched, cored, peeled, deseeded and quartered <br> 60ml extra-virgin olive oil <br> 2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only <br> Salt and pepper</p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 160C/325F/ gas mark 3. Lightly oil a flat baking tray and sprinkle with thyme, salt and pepper. Place the tomato quarters on the tray and cook for two to three hours, until lightly 'dried'.</p> <p>900g sashimi-quality Ahi tuna <br> 1 bulb fennel, finely diced <br> 4 spring onions, thinly sliced <br> 30g black olives, pitted and roughly chopped <br> 55g oven-dried tomatoes, chopped (see recipe above) <br> 1 small handful basil leaves, finely chopped <br> 225g new potatoes, boiled, peeled and finely diced <br> 125ml extra-virgin olive oil <br> 3 tbsp balsamic vinegar <br> Salt and pepper</p> <p>Remove all the sinew from the tuna, dice the flesh into 1cm cubes and place in a stainless-steel bowl. Add the fennel, spring onions, olives, oven-dried tomatoes and basil. Mix, and season generously.</p> <p>Make a vinaigrette by whisking the olive oil slowly into the vinegar, then season. Season the potato with salt, pepper and a little extra-virgin olive oil, then place in a ring mold or on a platter. Add the vinaigrette to the tuna mixture, mix and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Place the tuna on top of the potatoes and garnish with more basil leaves.</p> <p><b> ROCK SHRIMP GAZPACHO SALAD </b></p> <p>900g rock shrimp (other shrimp may be substituted) <br> 1 red bell pepper, seeds removed <br> 1 yellow bell pepper, seeds removed <br> 1 sweet onion, peeled <br> 4 sticks celery, de-stringed <br> 1 cucumber <br> 1 bulb fennel <br> 450g tomatoes <br> bunch flat-leaf parsley, washed, picked and cut into a chiffonade <br> bunch fresh coriander, washed, picked and cut into a chiffonade <br> Cayenne pepper <br> Salt and black pepper <br> 2 lemons, juiced <br> 125ml extra-virgin olive oil <br> 1 small loaf French bread</p> <p>Pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6. In a large saut\u00e9 pan, heat a little olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and saut\u00e9 until just cooked through: this should take about three or four minutes. Season to taste. Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate.</p> <p>Cut the peppers, onion, celery, cucumber and fennel into fine julienne strips. Place the vegetables in a bowl and chill. Cut the outer tomato flesh into a julienne. Remove the seeds, and pur\u00e9e the rest of the tomato in a blender or food processor. Pour into cheesecloth hanging above a small bowl for about an hour. Squeeze the remaining pur\u00e9e from the cheesecloth and add three tablespoons of olive oil, a tablespoon lemon juice, and salt, pepper and cayenne to taste. Chill.</p> <p>Make a lemon vinaigrette by whisking together the lemon juice and remaining olive oil. Season to taste.</p> <p>Cut the bread into very tiny croutons. Place on a baking sheet and cook in the hot oven until lightly toasted. Toss with a little olive oil, salt and pepper.</p> <p>To compose the dish, toss all the vegetables with the shrimp. Dress with the vinaigrette, salt and pepper, and stir in half of the fresh herbs. Place the tomato 'sauce' on a plate, spoon the shrimp mixture on top, then garnish with croutons and the rest of the herbs.</p> <p><b> RISOTTO WITH WINTER VEGETABLES AND SAUTEED MUSHROOMS </b></p> <p>1 small winter squash <br> 12 tbsp butter, divided <br> 1 small white onion, diced <br> 800g Arborio rice <br> 250ml white wine <br> 2 litres salted chicken stock, boiling (set aside 60ml) <br> 1 parsnip, peeled and diced <br> 1 bulb celery root, peeled and diced <br> 30g Parmesan, grated <br> 450g assorted mushrooms, cleaned and sliced <br> bunch flat-leaf parsley, washed, picked and chopped</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Cut the squash in half and remove any seeds. Peel and dice one half only. Put a tablespoon of butter in the other half, season, then place, cut-side down, on a baking tray and cook for 30-45 minutes until soft and tender. Spoon the cooked pulp into a blender and pur\u00e9e. Set aside.</p> <p>Now you can start making the risotto. In a large, heavy-based saucepan, melt four tablespoons of the butter. Add the onion and sweat over medium heat until translucent and tender. Add the rice and sweat gently. Add the wine and reduce completely, stirring constantly. Start adding the stock, a ladle at a time, stirring all the time.</p> <p>While watching over the risotto, sweat the parsnip in a tablespoon of butter. In a separate pan, sweat the celery root in another tablespoon of butter. In a third pan, sweat the diced squash in another tablespoon of butter until soft. In a small frying pan, saut\u00e9 the mushrooms in two tablespoons of the butter. Season each with salt and pepper. When the rice is almost cooked, after about 13 minutes, stir in the parsnip, celery root, squash and squash pur\u00e9e. Add the Parmesan, and season.</p> <p>Add the remaining chicken stock to the mushroom pan, reduce a little, then stir in the remaining butter and the parsley. Spoon the risotto into large bowls, and top with mushrooms.</p> <p><b> GOAT'S CHEESE AND HONEY FILO TART WITH SAUTEED SEASONAL FRUIT </b></p> <p>For the goat's cheese filling:</p> <p>450g mild goat's cheese <br> 1 egg <br> 8 tbsp honey <br> 2 tbsp all-purpose flour <br> 1 tbsp Grand Marnier <br> 1 pinch nutmeg</p> <p>Combine all the ingredients except the flour in a bowl, and mix with a wooden spoon. (Do not try to do this in a food processor as it will liquefy.) Gradually sift in the flour and mix thoroughly. Refrigerate until ready to use.</p> <p>For the filo dough:</p> <p>225g butter, clarified <br> 1 box shop-bought filo pastry <br> Sugar</p> <p>Clarified butter is very easy to make, and is by far the best thing to use here as it creates a crispier filo. Simply melt the butter, then set it in a warm place to settle for about 15-20 minutes. Once it has fully settled, it will look like oil with a film floating on top. Skim off this film, and spoon the clear butter below into a clean, dry container. Stop when you get to the watery substance, which should be discarded.</p> <p>To make the tart base, place a sheet of filo pastry on a board, brush with clarified butter, then sprinkle with a little sugar. Lay another sheet of filo on top, and repeat the process. Top this with a third sheet of filo brushed with butter. Make a second three-tier layer of filo the same way for the tart top.</p> <p>To assemble the tarts:</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 225C/425F/gas mark 7. Place the layered filo on a clean and dry surface. Depending on the diameter of your pastry, you should be able to make four to six tarts per filo square. Cut the filo into 13cm circles. Place two tablespoons of the cheese mixture in the middle of each round, and top with another pastry circle. Using a paring knife, seal the edges by folding them over each other. Repeat for each tart. Bake for seven to 10 minutes, until golden brown.</p> <p>For the fruit garnish:</p> <p><b> Use your imagination and nature's seasons to give you the inspiration for this garnish. You'll need the following: </b></p> <p>225-250g fresh fruit, peeled, seeded and cut into attractive shapes <br> Dried fruit (optional) Nuts (optional) <br> 60g butter <br> 5 tbsp sugar <br> 125ml white wine <br> 1 vanilla pod, split</p> <p>Combine the sugar, wine and vanilla in a saucepan, bring to the boil, lower the heat and reduce by two-thirds. Strain through a coarse strainer. Melt the butter in a saut\u00e9 pan over medium heat. Add the fruit (any hard fruit, such as pears or apples, should be added first, and cooked until just soft; softer fruit should go in last, so it does not turn mushy). Place some fruit and a little of the cooking syrup on a plate, then top with a warm tart.</p> <p>\u0095 Traci des Jardins is chef at Jardini\u00e8re, 300 Grove Street, San Francisco, tel 001 415 861 5555.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Despite having a name that inspires visions of some glamorous 40s movie star, Traci des Jardins is, in fact, one of San Francisco's hottest chefs. Her restaurant, Jardini\u00e8re, a short walk from San Francisco's City Hall, is a marked success in a city that, though it loves to eat, more often than not chews up and spits out even the most experienced of restaurateurs. The style and decor is laid-back California meets London's East End with a detour through New York's Tribeca, and the food wins praise all around. Being a female chef, and working on the US West Coast, one might imagine her serving what they call \"girl food\", all fussy and light, or \"California cuisine\", with fusion vinaigrettes, roasted veggie pastas and endless goat's cheese salads. But that would be wrong. With her pulled-back blonde hair, quiet voice, and serious demeanour, des Jardins heads her large team with strict but kindly professionalism. Named 1995 Rising Star Chef of the Year by the prestigious James Beard Foundation, the diminutive des Jardins previously ran Rubicon, a swank San Francisco restaurant owned by Francis Ford Coppola, Robert De Niro and Robin Williams. Even so, she shuns all of that fickle \"flavour of the month\" label common to so many top-class restaurants. It's an attitude that reflects a classic French training - des Jardins took the route of traditional apprenticeship, along the way working for such legendary establishments in France as Fr\u00e8res Troisgros and L'Arpege. Her menu, then, is built on solid foundations of classic French techniques - hearty food with a sensual nature; rather aptly, given her name, it also revolves around the freshest vegetables the local area has to offer. Risotto comes rich with sweetcorn and chanterelles, or resplendent with root vegetables; fish rests on a bed of leek pur\u00e9e and oil-crushed potatoes, and is sauced with curry-scented pumpkin; shortribs, a succulent and rich cut of beef, rests on a bed of celeriac pur\u00e9e with a salad of chanterelles and chestnuts.

AHI TUNA TARTARE NICOISE WITH POTATO AND OVEN-DRIED TOMATOES For the oven-dried tomatoes: 450g plum tomatoes, blanched, cored, peeled, deseeded and quartered 60ml extra-virgin olive oil 2 sprigs fresh thyme, leaves only Salt and pepper Pre-heat the oven to 160C/325F/ gas mark 3. Lightly oil a flat baking tray and sprinkle with thyme, salt and pepper. Place the tomato quarters on the tray and cook for two to three hours, until lightly 'dried'. 900g sashimi-quality Ahi tuna 1 bulb fennel, finely diced 4 spring onions, thinly sliced 30g black olives, pitted and roughly chopped 55g oven-dried tomatoes, chopped (see recipe above) 1 small handful basil leaves, finely chopped 225g new potatoes, boiled, peeled and finely diced 125ml extra-virgin olive oil 3 tbsp balsamic vinegar Salt and pepper Remove all the sinew from the tuna, dice the flesh into 1cm cubes and place in a stainless-steel bowl. Add the fennel, spring onions, olives, oven-dried tomatoes and basil. Mix, and season generously. Make a vinaigrette by whisking the olive oil slowly into the vinegar, then season. Season the potato with salt, pepper and a little extra-virgin olive oil, then place in a ring mold or on a platter. Add the vinaigrette to the tuna mixture, mix and adjust the seasoning as necessary. Place the tuna on top of the potatoes and garnish with more basil leaves. ROCK SHRIMP GAZPACHO SALAD 900g rock shrimp (other shrimp may be substituted) 1 red bell pepper, seeds removed 1 yellow bell pepper, seeds removed 1 sweet onion, peeled 4 sticks celery, de-stringed 1 cucumber 1 bulb fennel 450g tomatoes bunch flat-leaf parsley, washed, picked and cut into a chiffonade bunch fresh coriander, washed, picked and cut into a chiffonade Cayenne pepper Salt and black pepper 2 lemons, juiced 125ml extra-virgin olive oil 1 small loaf French bread Pre-heat the oven to 200C/400F/ gas mark 6. In a large saut\u00e9 pan, heat a little olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp and saut\u00e9 until just cooked through: this should take about three or four minutes. Season to taste. Transfer to a bowl, cover and refrigerate. Cut the peppers, onion, celery, cucumber and fennel into fine julienne strips. Place the vegetables in a bowl and chill. Cut the outer tomato flesh into a julienne. Remove the seeds, and pur\u00e9e the rest of the tomato in a blender or food processor. Pour into cheesecloth hanging above a small bowl for about an hour. Squeeze the remaining pur\u00e9e from the cheesecloth and add three tablespoons of olive oil, a tablespoon lemon juice, and salt, pepper and cayenne to taste. Chill. Make a lemon vinaigrette by whisking together the lemon juice and remaining olive oil. Season to taste. Cut the bread into very tiny croutons. Place on a baking sheet and cook in the hot oven until lightly toasted. Toss with a little olive oil, salt and pepper. To compose the dish, toss all the vegetables with the shrimp. Dress with the vinaigrette, salt and pepper, and stir in half of the fresh herbs. Place the tomato 'sauce' on a plate, spoon the shrimp mixture on top, then garnish with croutons and the rest of the herbs. RISOTTO WITH WINTER VEGETABLES AND SAUTEED MUSHROOMS 1 small winter squash 12 tbsp butter, divided 1 small white onion, diced 800g Arborio rice 250ml white wine 2 litres salted chicken stock, boiling (set aside 60ml) 1 parsnip, peeled and diced 1 bulb celery root, peeled and diced 30g Parmesan, grated 450g assorted mushrooms, cleaned and sliced bunch flat-leaf parsley, washed, picked and chopped Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Cut the squash in half and remove any seeds. Peel and dice one half only. Put a tablespoon of butter in the other half, season, then place, cut-side down, on a baking tray and cook for 30-45 minutes until soft and tender. Spoon the cooked pulp into a blender and pur\u00e9e. Set aside. Now you can start making the risotto. In a large, heavy-based saucepan, melt four tablespoons of the butter. Add the onion and sweat over medium heat until translucent and tender. Add the rice and sweat gently. Add the wine and reduce completely, stirring constantly. Start adding the stock, a ladle at a time, stirring all the time. While watching over the risotto, sweat the parsnip in a tablespoon of butter. In a separate pan, sweat the celery root in another tablespoon of butter. In a third pan, sweat the diced squash in another tablespoon of butter until soft. In a small frying pan, saut\u00e9 the mushrooms in two tablespoons of the butter. Season each with salt and pepper. When the rice is almost cooked, after about 13 minutes, stir in the parsnip, celery root, squash and squash pur\u00e9e. Add the Parmesan, and season. Add the remaining chicken stock to the mushroom pan, reduce a little, then stir in the remaining butter and the parsley. Spoon the risotto into large bowls, and top with mushrooms. GOAT'S CHEESE AND HONEY FILO TART WITH SAUTEED SEASONAL FRUIT For the goat's cheese filling: 450g mild goat's cheese 1 egg 8 tbsp honey 2 tbsp all-purpose flour 1 tbsp Grand Marnier 1 pinch nutmeg Combine all the ingredients except the flour in a bowl, and mix with a wooden spoon. (Do not try to do this in a food processor as it will liquefy.) Gradually sift in the flour and mix thoroughly. Refrigerate until ready to use. For the filo dough: 225g butter, clarified 1 box shop-bought filo pastry Sugar Clarified butter is very easy to make, and is by far the best thing to use here as it creates a crispier filo. Simply melt the butter, then set it in a warm place to settle for about 15-20 minutes. Once it has fully settled, it will look like oil with a film floating on top. Skim off this film, and spoon the clear butter below into a clean, dry container. Stop when you get to the watery substance, which should be discarded.

Place two tablespoons of the cheese mixture in the middle of each round, and top with another pastry circle. Using a paring knife, seal the edges by folding them over each other. Repeat for each tart. Bake for seven to 10 minutes, until golden brown. For the fruit garnish: Use your imagination and nature's seasons to give you the inspiration for this garnish. You'll need the following: 225-250g fresh fruit, peeled, seeded and cut into attractive shapes Dried fruit (optional) Nuts (optional) 60g butter 5 tbsp sugar 125ml white wine 1 vanilla pod, split Combine the sugar, wine and vanilla in a saucepan, bring to the boil, lower the heat and reduce by two-thirds.

      "body": "<p>There's nothing very exotic about classic Chilean street food. Imagine a hot dog hidden beneath an explosion of mayonnaise and ketchup. Cost? Twenty-five to 30 pence. This is the completo, an all-purpose solution to breakfast, lunch or once , the curiously English teatime snack enjoyed by Chileans of all ages. </p> <p>Many foreigners imagine that Latin American cuisine is spicy, but Chilean food, on the whole, is extremely bland: salt, vinegar, mayonnaise and more salt are the four basic condiments. Black pepper is conspicuously absent, and not only from the food - it is also rarely available even on request. Chilean aji and pebre are the exceptions: these sauces, made from spicy chilli peppers, are available as a companion for bread (always white; sales of fresh bread here are among the highest in the world - annual per capita consumption of the stuff is a staggering 120kg per person, much of it eaten mid-afternoon, when it is sold by the kilo and consumed while still warm). </p> <p>During the economic slowdown that has shackled Chile's economy for the past two years, street food has become an increasingly popular alternative to traditional sit-down restaurants. The lunchtime exodus from the office is so rigidly synchronised that, at 2pm, the street stands are packed and, despite the high odds of squirting either the mayo or ketchup on one's own shirt, the completo is the hands-on top choice. </p> <p>The hotdog 'n' mayo combination isn't the only popular dish, however. Other food-to-go favourites include the results of filling a cauldron of boiling oil with a melange of fried dough, lard and horsemeat. The horse-and-dough mixture is quickly cooked and served scalding hot at street corners and bus stations. Small hammers are used by the vendors to pound the meat into a pliable - or, at least, more chewable - condition that resembles something between shoe leather and the grease-sodden cardboard that accompanies pizzas worldwide. \"It is always better when they marinate it for a few days,\" says Olivier Jeannot, the 28-year-old owner of the restaurant Etniko. When asked what, exactly, such a marinade would consist of, he laughs: \"Water. Just water.\" </p> <p>Then there's the street barbecue, complete with its kilos of top beef, which remains a staple of Chilean street life. Vegetarians are doomed in the Chilean street-food scene, though if they are willing to ingest small quantities of lard they can enjoy the ever-popular squash, salt and lard biscuits known as sopaipillas. Here, a basic dough mixture is fried in hot oil to a brown crisp and the resulting pancake-shaped snacks are sold by the pair for just 20p. For flavour, sopaipillas are topped with mustard, chilli sauce or icing sugar. </p> <p>Even so, there is a slow move towards consuming less red meat and more of the fresh fruit and vegetables for which Chile is known worldwide. These provide the ingredients for a series of roadside snacks that form the nucleus of the Creole and rural Chilean diet. These dishes are specialities in Santiago's many traditional street restaurants, and include humitas (boiled corn paste wrapped in corn husk), pastel de choclo (corn and meat casserole), charquican (vegetables and dried beef), budin de acelga (leafy greens in a cheese casserole), porotos granados (thick soup made from fresh shelled beans and pumpkin squash), porotos con riendas (beans cooked with spaghetti), pollo arvejado (chicken cooked in juices and peas), and cazuela (chicken or beef soup with vegetables). </p> <p>Chilean food continues to evolve from the traditional peasant fare of beans and meat to an ongoing experimentation with the wonders of the country's 2,600-mile coastline that provides an extraordinary variety of seafood, shellfish and seaweeds. Empanadas are Chilean meat pies inside a breaded crust, and typically hold a combination of either cheese and meat or seafood and onions - recent streetside additions include scallops. </p> <p>For pudding, Chileans - the men, in particular - opt for a combination of acidic coffee, a glass of mineral water and a full serving of cleavage. It's known locally as cafe con piernas (rough translation: coffee with leggy waitress included). Many streetcorner stands specialise in this national dessert, and do very well out of it, too, not least because the heady mixture of voyeurism, caffeine and spandex costs only around 80p. While the half-naked waitresses wearing nothing but g-strings and nipple pasties pour coffee and dispense free advice, the predominantly male clientele gawk and ponder flirtatious one-liners. The waitresses leave little to the imagination - but, in a way, they are a representation of Chilean street food, which is hardly subtle, is quickly ingested and is a rather simplistic response to the most basic human tastes. </p> <p> All recipes serve six. </p> <p><strong> Sopaipillas </strong></p> <p>1kg plain flour <br>200g cooked squash, mashed <br>125g lard <br>Salt, as desired <br>Oil, for frying</p> <p>For the sauce </p> <p>300ml water <br>100g molasses <br>1 stick cinnamon <br>The peel of 1 orange </p> <p>Make a soft dough with the flour, lard, salt and squash.

      "bodyText": "There's nothing very exotic about classic Chilean street food. Imagine a hot dog hidden beneath an explosion of mayonnaise and ketchup. Cost? Twenty-five to 30 pence. This is the completo, an all-purpose solution to breakfast, lunch or once , the curiously English teatime snack enjoyed by Chileans of all ages. Many foreigners imagine that Latin American cuisine is spicy, but Chilean food, on the whole, is extremely bland: salt, vinegar, mayonnaise and more salt are the four basic condiments. Black pepper is conspicuously absent, and not only from the food - it is also rarely available even on request. Chilean aji and pebre are the exceptions: these sauces, made from spicy chilli peppers, are available as a companion for bread (always white; sales of fresh bread here are among the highest in the world - annual per capita consumption of the stuff is a staggering 120kg per person, much of it eaten mid-afternoon, when it is sold by the kilo and consumed while still warm). During the economic slowdown that has shackled Chile's economy for the past two years, street food has become an increasingly popular alternative to traditional sit-down restaurants. The lunchtime exodus from the office is so rigidly synchronised that, at 2pm, the street stands are packed and, despite the high odds of squirting either the mayo or ketchup on one's own shirt, the completo is the hands-on top choice. The hotdog 'n' mayo combination isn't the only popular dish, however. Other food-to-go favourites include the results of filling a cauldron of boiling oil with a melange of fried dough, lard and horsemeat. The horse-and-dough mixture is quickly cooked and served scalding hot at street corners and bus stations. Small hammers are used by the vendors to pound the meat into a pliable - or, at least, more chewable - condition that resembles something between shoe leather and the grease-sodden cardboard that accompanies pizzas worldwide. \"It is always better when they marinate it for a few days,\" says Olivier Jeannot, the 28-year-old owner of the restaurant Etniko. When asked what, exactly, such a marinade would consist of, he laughs: \"Water. Just water.\" Then there's the street barbecue, complete with its kilos of top beef, which remains a staple of Chilean street life. Vegetarians are doomed in the Chilean street-food scene, though if they are willing to ingest small quantities of lard they can enjoy the ever-popular squash, salt and lard biscuits known as sopaipillas. Here, a basic dough mixture is fried in hot oil to a brown crisp and the resulting pancake-shaped snacks are sold by the pair for just 20p. For flavour, sopaipillas are topped with mustard, chilli sauce or icing sugar. Even so, there is a slow move towards consuming less red meat and more of the fresh fruit and vegetables for which Chile is known worldwide. These provide the ingredients for a series of roadside snacks that form the nucleus of the Creole and rural Chilean diet. These dishes are specialities in Santiago's many traditional street restaurants, and include humitas (boiled corn paste wrapped in corn husk), pastel de choclo (corn and meat casserole), charquican (vegetables and dried beef), budin de acelga (leafy greens in a cheese casserole), porotos granados (thick soup made from fresh shelled beans and pumpkin squash), porotos con riendas (beans cooked with spaghetti), pollo arvejado (chicken cooked in juices and peas), and cazuela (chicken or beef soup with vegetables). Chilean food continues to evolve from the traditional peasant fare of beans and meat to an ongoing experimentation with the wonders of the country's 2,600-mile coastline that provides an extraordinary variety of seafood, shellfish and seaweeds. Empanadas are Chilean meat pies inside a breaded crust, and typically hold a combination of either cheese and meat or seafood and onions - recent streetside additions include scallops. For pudding, Chileans - the men, in particular - opt for a combination of acidic coffee, a glass of mineral water and a full serving of cleavage. It's known locally as cafe con piernas (rough translation: coffee with leggy waitress included). Many streetcorner stands specialise in this national dessert, and do very well out of it, too, not least because the heady mixture of voyeurism, caffeine and spandex costs only around 80p. While the half-naked waitresses wearing nothing but g-strings and nipple pasties pour coffee and dispense free advice, the predominantly male clientele gawk and ponder flirtatious one-liners. The waitresses leave little to the imagination - but, in a way, they are a representation of Chilean street food, which is hardly subtle, is quickly ingested and is a rather simplistic response to the most basic human tastes. All recipes serve six. Sopaipillas 1kg plain flour 200g cooked squash, mashed 125g lard Salt, as desired Oil, for frying For the sauce 300ml water 100g molasses 1 stick cinnamon The peel of 1 orange Make a soft dough with the flour, lard, salt and squash. Pull off a tennis-ball sized piece of dough, keeping the rest covered so it does not go dry, then knead and stretch it until it is about 1cm thick. Cut into small rounds, skewer on to a long fork and fry in hot oil. Remove from the oil and place on kitchen towel. Heat the water, then add the molasses, cinnamon and orange peel. Boil until the molasses dissolves. Dip the hot sopaipillas in the sauce. Meat Empanadas 1kg plain flour 3 tsp baking powder 125g lard, melted 1 tbsp salt 200ml warm milk For the filling 500g beef 3 large onions 3 tbsp lard 2 tsp paprika tsp oregano tsp cumin 85g raisins 125g black olives 3 hard-boiled eggs Salt Chop the meat into small pieces. Do the same with the onion. Wash the raisins and leave them soaking in hot water for an hour. In a large frying pan, melt the lard, fry the meat until browned, then add the onion, paprika, oregano, salt and cumin. Stir with a wooden spoon to spread the flavours around. Cook until the onion has become transparent. Remove from the heat and leave to sit, preferably for one day. On the counter, mix the flour with the baking powder and salt.

Wet the edge of the dough, fold and seal. Scatter some flour over a baking tray and place the empanadas on top. Brush with a little milk and prick with a fork several times, so they don't burst while cooking. Place in preheated medium oven, and cook for around 40 minutes. Serve hot. Eggs with corn sauce 6 eggs 6 triangles white bread 85g cooked corn 50g breadcrumbs, toasted 30g butter 60ml cream Fresh basil Salt Poach the eggs in water and vinegar, then place them on the bread triangles and season with salt. In a blender, whizz the corn to a rough paste. In a saucepan, cook the breadcrumbs, blended corn, butter, cream, a little hot water and chopped basil over a low heat until it thickens. Add salt as needed. Serve the eggs covered with the corn-cream sauce. Olive Tortilla 50 green olives, stoned and roughly chopped 2 tsp capers, chopped 6 eggs 55g butter Salt Mix together the olives with the capers. Beat the eggs and season with salt.

      "body": "<p>The tok-tok-tok of a stick banging against a hollowed-out wooden block outside my house was clashing with the more sonorous timbre of a small gong being struck repeatedly. Further down the street, a high-pitched whine was competing with the blander sounds of a man banging a spoon against a plate, another banging a spoon against a glass, a third banging an indiscernible object against some wood and a fourth who seemed to be shouting, \"Me! Me! Me!\" </p> <p>This grating cacophony, which varies slightly every day, depending on who is around, means only one thing - lunch, quite literally, is on its way down the road. Each sound is the signature tune of one of the dozens of food vendors trundling his (they are almost never her) wares around the streets. That tok-tok-tok means that the meatballs, usually with noodles, are approaching. The gong signifies ice cream. The whine comes from a copper steamer used to cook rice flour and coconut cakes. The spoon rapped on a plate means either a mixture of congealed sticky rice, tofu and other delights, or chicken soup and rice. The spoon against glass means desserts, particularly fruit jelly drinks, while the banging on wood is usually fried rice. Me! Me! Me! indicates not an annoyingly self-centred exhibitionist but a fried noodle seller (\"mie\" means noodles). </p> <p>These ubiquitous kitchens are little more than a two-wheeled trolley, known as a kaki lima (five legs). The legs in question are the trolley's two wheels, the wooden stand that supports it at one end when stationary and the chef's own two feet. Despite being the slowest thing on the road, they seem to have carte blanche to go where they like, when they like - it's not uncommon to come across an unlit kaki lima going the wrong way down the fast lane of a triple-lane thoroughfare at night. Any collision would be blamed on the car driver. </p> <p>Kaki limas, their sounds and drivers' habits are but one facet of a street food culture that is, unsurprisingly, as varied as the country's 13,600 islands. In Minahasa, say, a region of northern Sulawesi, the wags say that the only things with legs that are not eaten on the street are the chairs and tables. In West Sumatra, the home of Padang cuisine, the food comes in two main varieties: very spicy and mouth-burning hot. And across the heartland of Java, most stalls cater to the popular refrain, \"Belum makan nasi, belum makan\" - \"If I haven't eaten rice, I haven't eaten\". </p> <p>Despite such regional variations, common themes run throughout the country. The first is that street food is a feast for all the senses, not just the tastebuds. As the kaki limas highlight, sound is as important as anything else in differentiating the choices on offer. Visual elegance, too (both of the food on the plate and the stall), is crucial to success, although it tends to go by the wayside once a stall is established. The heady aroma of freshly cooked food is a common feature at any bus station or market, and does wonders to dull the stench of reeking drains, smoke-belching buses and sweaty people. Cutlery is an undesired luxury - the preferred means of eating is using the right hand (the left is reserved for other tasks, toilet paper being scarce in rural Indonesia) to compress food into a ball and pop it into the mouth. </p> <p>Food from most provinces can be found all over the country. Padang food is one example, as are the Warung Tegal stalls, named after the central Java town where they originated, that serve basic rice and noodle dishes. As a result, any Indonesian who is far from home can usually find something they recognise and are comfortable eating. This hints at another strong feature of Indonesian street food: it has changed little over the years, because Indonesians tend to be conservative eaters. Most actually hate cooking, but they do know what they like and are not inclined to experiment. </p> <p>Mr Sastro typifies this attitude. He opened his warung in Jakarta in 1958, and has not altered the recipes (chicken fried rice and two types of fried noodles) since: \"I've never even thought about changing things. People like what I cook and I don't want to risk losing them.\" </p> <p>Like is a major understatement. People come from miles around to eat his rice and noodles or to grab a takeaway portion wrapped in a banana leaf. \"I don't mind waiting half an hour for my food,\" says Eduard Harlen, who had come six miles on the back of a motorbike taxi to get his supper. \"He gives generous helpings that are delicious.\" Word of Mr Sastro's offerings reached society's upper echelons decades ago, and it is not uncommon to see ministers' cars parked outside. \"Usually, they only send their drivers, but sometimes the bigwigs come themselves,\" says Mr Sastro. </p> <p>Price is another reason for the lack of innovation. With more than 50 million Indonesians earning less than \u00a31.50 a week, much of the population cannot afford anything but the basics. It is uncanny how this lowest-common-denominator factor has prevailed, and it certainly shows no sign of being superseded by any nouvelle trends. </p> <p>The most amazing aspect of Indonesian street food, however, is what it does not include: namely, the spices (nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves) that first put the archipelago on the global map some 600 years ago and that prompted Christopher Columbus to sail across the Atlantic in search of the eastern Indonesian Banda islands. Few can explain why they are not used, except, perhaps, that they do not go particularly well with either rice or noodles. </p> <p>Fear of catching some dread lurgy is what prompts most foreigners to avoid warungs and kaki limas like the plague, and head instead to the smarter hotels and restaurants. But, more often than not, the latter, if anything, pose a greater threat to your health, because the food is prepared hours in advance and just left out, whereas on the street the food is cooked in front of you. </p> <p>So, if it's a genuine taste of Indonesian cuisine you're after, don't head for a hotel. Just walk down the street and take your pick from the dozens of meals on offer. Or, if you're feeling lazy, just wait for the trolley orchestra to come your way.</p> <p><strong> Tips</strong></p> <p> It is practically impossible to create truly authentic Indonesian street food in any indoor kitchen because there is no artificial replacement for the magic je ne sais quoi that is picked up in the pan over years of outdoor use on a grubby kerosene stove and never properly washed off. </p> <p>Indonesians love spicy food, and usually add chilli sauce to everything. This can kill the flavour, so it might be advisable to go easy on the chillies, especially the spicier green ones. </p> <p>Indonesian meat is often very tough. To make it tender, people boil it for an hour or so before frying or grilling. </p> <p>Another common ingredient is MSG - when following recipes that include MSG in Indonesian cookbooks, it might be better to omit it. </p> <p>In recipes that stipulate goat, lamb is a perfectly acceptable alternative. </p> <p><strong> Mr Sastro's fried rice or noodles </strong></p> <p> Per portion. Melt some margarine in a wok. Add chopped garlic and red onion, and any herbs and spices you like (Mr Sastro uses a little bit of cardamom, coriander and lemongrass), then cook until the aroma starts to tickle your nostrils. Throw in as much cooked rice (or noodles) as you want, some boiled chicken cut into pieces, finely chopped white cabbage, a tablespoon or two of chicken stock, some beaten egg and a teaspoon or two of crushed fresh chilli. Season with a little vinegar, sweet soy sauce and salt and pepper. Mr Sastro boils the chicken gizzards, chops them into slices and mixes a few into each portion. Serve with lettuce leaves and sliced tomato and cucumber. To make it a special, add a turned-over fried egg. Most younger chefs use vegetable oil instead of margarine. </p> <p><strong> Satay </strong></p> <p> Use any meat, or prawns. The meat should be cut into bite-sized portions and marinaded for at least three hours. Some street chefs use more than two dozen ingredients in their marinades. The basics are two tablespoons of chilli oil, two tablespoons of sweet soy sauce, half a teaspoon of lemon juice, one crushed clove of garlic and a teaspoon of salt. Then add whatever takes your fancy, such as ginger, grated candlenuts, tamarind juice, coriander, shrimp paste softened in warm water, chopped chilli, red onions, pepper, a bayleaf. It's best to cook the meat over charcoal, but you can cheat and use a gas cooker. </p> <p>Satay is usually served with two sauces: a soy sauce mixed with chopped chillies, red onions and a dash of lemon juice; and a peanut sauce. There is a wide variety of peanut sauce recipes, but an easy way out is to use the same one as used for gado-gado (below), only without the coconut milk. </p> <p><strong> Gado-Gado</strong></p> <p> An Indonesian salad that is a meal in itself. Tofu, cabbage, beansprouts, egg, spinach, green beans, watercress, cucumber, carrots. Some Indonesians like to cook their gado-gado, others like it part-cooked, and others still prefer it raw, apart from the tofu, which should be fried in oil until brown, and the egg, which should be hardboiled. There is no correct answer. Once the salad is assembled, pour over the peanut sauce. </p> <p><strong> Peanut sauce </strong></p> <p> Ingredients: 1 tbsp vegetable oil, 1 clove crushed garlic, green chilli (amount depends on your tastebuds), 1 tsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp tamarind juice, tsp salt, 1 chopped onion, 4 tbsp chunky peanut butter, 1 small piece lemongrass, 1 dab shrimp paste, 1 tsp sweet soy sauce, 3 tbsp coconut milk. Fry the onion and garlic in oil. Mix the peanut butter with 150ml water and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat, add the chilli, lemongrass, brown sugar, shrimp paste, tamarind juice, soy sauce and salt. Add the onion and garlic. Stir in the coconut milk. Simmer over low heat. If it is not smooth enough, liquidise it, but the chunks add a little extra something. </p> <p><strong> Beef rendang </strong></p> <p> A Padang dish. Ingredients: 1 tbsp vegetable oil, 1 tsp turmeric, 1 stick lemongrass, outer leaves discarded, bruised and chopped, 3 lime leaves, 2 red chillies, crushed, 425ml coconut milk, 3 cloves garlic crushed, tsp ginger, 450g beef loin, thinly sliced, 1 tsp salt, 1 bayleaf. Saut\u00e9 the garlic, turmeric, ginger and lemongrass in oil. Add meat, chilli and salt. Add the coconut milk and bayleaf, cover and simmer until the sauce is thick. Best served hot, but is also eaten cold</p>",

There is a wide variety of peanut sauce recipes, but an easy way out is to use the same one as used for gado-gado (below), only without the coconut milk. Gado-Gado An Indonesian salad that is a meal in itself. Tofu, cabbage, beansprouts, egg, spinach, green beans, watercress, cucumber, carrots. Some Indonesians like to cook their gado-gado, others like it part-cooked, and others still prefer it raw, apart from the tofu, which should be fried in oil until brown, and the egg, which should be hardboiled. There is no correct answer. Once the salad is assembled, pour over the peanut sauce. Peanut sauce Ingredients: 1 tbsp vegetable oil, 1 clove crushed garlic, green chilli (amount depends on your tastebuds), 1 tsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp tamarind juice, tsp salt, 1 chopped onion, 4 tbsp chunky peanut butter, 1 small piece lemongrass, 1 dab shrimp paste, 1 tsp sweet soy sauce, 3 tbsp coconut milk. Fry the onion and garlic in oil. Mix the peanut butter with 150ml water and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat, add the chilli, lemongrass, brown sugar, shrimp paste, tamarind juice, soy sauce and salt. Add the onion and garlic. Stir in the coconut milk. Simmer over low heat. If it is not smooth enough, liquidise it, but the chunks add a little extra something. Beef rendang A Padang dish. Ingredients: 1 tbsp vegetable oil, 1 tsp turmeric, 1 stick lemongrass, outer leaves discarded, bruised and chopped, 3 lime leaves, 2 red chillies, crushed, 425ml coconut milk, 3 cloves garlic crushed, tsp ginger, 450g beef loin, thinly sliced, 1 tsp salt, 1 bayleaf. Saut\u00e9 the garlic, turmeric, ginger and lemongrass in oil. Add meat, chilli and salt. Add the coconut milk and bayleaf, cover and simmer until the sauce is thick. Best served hot, but is also eaten cold",

      "body": "<p>Countries with a Pacific coastline produce some of the most provocative wines in the world. Even Thailand knocks out a couple of reasonable tipples: <strong> Chatemp Blanc 2541 Summer Harvest</strong> and <strong> Chatemp Rouge 2541 Summer Harvest</strong>. They are made by a Frenchman, Laurent Metge-Toppin, from vineyards so fecund that they produce two crops a year. They rate 13 points out of 20, and you can find them in Thai restaurants and some London stockists - namely, Gerry's in Old Compton Street, W1, Queen's Club Wines in W14, and Whistlestop Food &amp; Wine at various large railway termini - for between \u00a36.99 and \u00a39.95. </p> <p>Mexico doesn't sound up to much at first, either, but LA Cetto in Baja California, has consistently produced blisteringly fruity reds and the current one in form is the <strong> 1997 Petite Sirah </strong> (17 points, \u00a34.99): it has hugely individual fruit, is slightly spicy and richly succulent, and has fantastically alert tannins. This exceptional wine is available at Somerfield and Waitrose. </p> <p>Don't scoff: remember, Australia was once as little regarded as Mexico, yet we now have an abundance of its wines to dazzle our palates. <strong> Wynns Coonawarra Shiraz 1997</strong> (16.5 points, Budgens, \u00a36.99) is an invigorating mouthful of high-class fruit. The mineral tanginess is delicious, but what impresses most is the way the fruit spreads itself over the tongue, revealing dry, rich nuances from superb tannins. <strong> Peter Lehmann The Barossa Shiraz 1998</strong> (17 points, Oddbins, Safeway, Waitrose, \u00a36.99) is possibly the most vibrant Shiraz for the money on the market: dry, elegant, deep, beautifully textured. <strong> Woolshed Cabernet/Shiraz/Merlot Coonawarra 1998</strong> (17 points, Safeway, \u00a35.99) has stunning richness and textured fruit of huge depth and charm - a magnificently mouth-watering wine. <strong> Rosemount 'Hill Of Gold' Shiraz Mudgee 1998</strong> (17.5 points, Safeway, Waitrose, \u00a39.99) is a rarity: a Rosemount red with world-class tannins. It has beautifully well-knit fruit, offering a gripping experience. <strong> Voyager Estate Chardonnay 1997</strong> (17.5 points, Waitrose, \u00a310.99) is remarkably chewy, ripe, creamy and subtly vegetal. (Check the vintage, as the 1998 will be phased in soon and the rating applies to the 1997.) Even dear old Spar has a terrific Aussie white: the own-label <strong> Australian Semillon Chardonnay 1999</strong> (16 points, \u00a34.49), which has lovely, oily fruit: bold, thick, rich and purposeful. </p> <p>Two beautifully mature Aussie whites at Wine Rack and Bottoms Up are <strong> Michelton Viognier Rousanne 1997</strong> (17 points, \u00a312.99), which flaunts lovely oily fruit, and <strong> The Willows Vineyard Semillon 1996</strong> (17.5 points, \u00a38.49), which has a captivating, mellow, smoky richness and fine texture. </p> <p>Chile is now also a force on the UK market. <strong> Cono Sur Merlot 1999</strong> (16 points, Asda, Wine Cellar, \u00a34.49-\u00a34.99) has pliant, berried fruit with the texture of velvet. <strong> Santa Rita Triple C 1997</strong> (17 points, Majestic, \u00a310.99) is full of densely-packed, gently savoury plums, pears and apricots, plus leathery tannins.It performs like a crazed claret. </p> <p> <strong> Casa Lapostolle Cuv\u00e9e Alexandre Merlot 1998</strong> (17.5 points, Oddbins, \u00a313.99) is an immense construct, which, as the thoughtful taster gargles it around the molars, seems like some game sauce of quite unusual complexity: savoury, ripe, sweet, then dry to finish. <strong> Valdivieso Single Vineyard Merlot Reserve 1998</strong> (16.5 points, Safeway, \u00a38.99) inspired the tasting note, \"Heaven has arrived!\" and from such metaphysical nonsense you may deduce my overwhelming approval. <strong> Valdivieso Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve 1998</strong> (17 points, Tesco, \u00a36.99) offers coffee, cocoa, herbs, roast meat and lush tannins. It's a generous assembly of great richness. <strong> Caliterra Reserve Syrah 1999</strong> (16.5 points, Tesco, \u00a38.99) has gorgeous spice to its hedgerow fruits (plus plums), combined with savoury tannins to give it serious backbone. This is a wine of consummately well-textured class. <strong> Errazuriz Don Maximiano 1998</strong> (16 points, Tesco, \u00a317.99) requires deep digging in the pocket, but offers deep digging for the tastebuds, too, for it has cassis-edged fruit with superb tannins that give the wine power, concentration and a characterful yet polished personality. </p> <p>And last, from the Chilean neck of the woods, one great white wine: <strong> Casa Lapostolle Chardonnay 1998</strong> (17 points, Oddbins, Unwins, \u00a36.99). It is breathtakingly elegant, subtle, complex and immensely quaffable. It has undertones of ambrosia, and fills the ears with choirs of angels. </p> <p>New Zealand is most blessed by the maritime climate bequeathed by the Pacific, and this shows particularly clearly in the whites (bitingly fresh acids, limpid fruit). <strong> Villa Maria Reserve Clifford Bay Sauvignon Blanc 1999</strong> (16.5 points, Oddbins, \u00a39.99) has the typical grassy aroma leading to ripeness and concentration. <strong> Grove Mill Sauvignon Blanc 1999 </strong> (16.5 points, Safeway, Sainsbury, \u00a37.49) offers superbly clean fruit of compressed gooseberries and minerals. <strong> Villa Maria Private Bin Riesling 1999</strong> (16 points, Thresher, Victoria Wine, \u00a35.99) is young as yet, but deliciously drinkable - not like riesling as we know it from Europe, it has an ineffably exotic and subtle edge to its smooth acids, which will develop more excitingly if cellared for the next eight years (it is also available at Waitrose, but is selling out fast). <strong> Villa Maria Lightly Oaked Chardonnay 1999</strong> (16 points, Thresher, Victoria Wine, \u00a36.99) is plump but not fat, lithe yet not thin, fruity yet not full - it has, then, the classic virtues of the old world along with the purity of expression of the new. And <strong> Villa Maria Private Bin Sauvignon Blanc 1999</strong> (16 points, Thresher, Victoria Wine, \u00a36.99) has great texture and warmth of welcome with a delicious, lively finish. </p> <p>On the Kiwi's red team, there is <strong> Te Mata Estate Cabernet Merlot 1998 </strong> (16.5 points, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up, \u00a38.49), which performs like a great novel, offering plot, character, wit and a great climax. </p> <p>California tells a different but no less involving story. <strong> Kautz-Ironstone Shiraz 1997</strong> (16 points, Majestic, \u00a35.99) is a very vibrant personality of meaty depth and resounding richness: not typically Californian or even Shiraz, but that's its charm. <strong> Fetzer Vineyards Select Zinfandel 1997 </strong> (16.5 points, Oddbins, \u00a37.99) is jammy, spicy, very ripe and awesomely delicious. <strong> Fetzer Sundial Chardonnay 1997</strong> (16 points, Unwins, \u00a35.49) is soft and slightly under-ripe, but gracious as it finishes. <strong> Stonybrook Chardonnay 1998 </strong> (16 points, Booths, \u00a34.99) has lovely plump, ripe fruit - a \"gorgeously demure melonosity\", my tasting notes proclaim. <strong> Bonterra Vineyards Merlot 1997</strong> (16.5 points, Waitrose, \u00a39.99) shows great organic class and polish, with outstanding tannins and acids to balance brilliantly dryly the lashings of sweet fruit. </p> <p>Indeed, if there is a theme to the fine wines from littorally Pacific lands, then this is it: balance. You can taste the cool oceanic nights in the wines from the best vintages. Such nights induce the grapes to produce acids to counter the daylight sugars, which the abundant sunshine guarantees</p>",

      "body": "<p>It's 3.30 on a Thursday afternoon, and I'm sitting in the dimly lit basement of Yo! Below in Soho. I'm here working my way through a line-up of flavoured sakes, which is not as cushy a number as you might think, not least because I'm trying to do so to the deafening background noise of Kim and Vee, the bartenders, practising their karaoke act. What's more, even the surprisingly proficient quality of Vee's singing doesn't quite compensate for the really weird flavours on offer - there's a rather cough-mixturish raspberry sake, a hazelnut one that tastes like pulverised Cadbury's Whole Nut and a gloopy, yeasty \"Pearl\" sake, which looks, er, like spunk, if truth be told. Vee tells me, when she finally pauses for breath, that she prefers the hot-house sake - \"It's good for my voice.\" Well, I wouldn't mind being able to sing as well as her, so that's a pretty strong recommendation.</p> <p>At the moment, flavoured sakes are mainly restricted to Japanese-inspired bars such as Yo! Below, Itsu and Nobu, but wait a few months and you'll see them everywhere - if you don't believe me, remember what happened to flavoured vodkas a few years back. Of course, the Japanese wouldn't touch them with a bargepole, but that doesn't really matter as much as you might think, because they're unlikely to be offered any in a neighbourhood Tokyo bar - these sakes are made in Oregon, where fusion flavours reign supreme.</p> <p>Curiously, it's actually cheaper for a sake producer to set up shop in the US, because the cost of rice there is about a quarter of that in Japan. Unsurprisingly, then, seven of the top Japanese brewers now have production facilities in the country - there is even a sake garden in the Napa Valley. Sake's principle appeal for the health-obsessed American public is that it is low in sulphur and doesn't give you a hangover. So great is its potential, in fact, that Griffith Frost of Sak\u00e9One in Oregon predicts that before long one in five glasses of wine consumed in the US will be a sake - roughly the same figure it currently accounts for globally.</p> <p>Given sake's rather unappealing flavour - at least, to western palates - that might seem a rather implausible, not to say over-optimistic claim, but Ian Haffety of Sheffield-based Distinctive Drinks Company, which distributes the Momokawa range, similarly reckons that the public will rapidly come round to Japan's national tipple. \"People might think that sake is disgusting,\" he admits, \"but then, how many of them would drink vodka or tequila straight? Very few. In cocktails, however, they're the biggest-selling drinks on the market.</p> <p>\"Most people have come across sake only in Japanese restaurants, where it's often very poor quality and served hot,\" continues Haffety. \"But there are lots and lots of different sakes - sweet, dry, unfiltered, flavoured - and you can be as creative with sake as you can with other spirits.\"</p> <p>Cocktails currently being intrepidly promoted by Haffety's company include the vivid blue Tounami (silver sake, blue Cura\u00e7ao, Bombay Sapphire gin, orgeat syrup and milk), Japanese Bulldog (pearl sake, Kahlua, cream and Coca-Cola) and Black Sea (silver sake, Bombay Sapphire, lemon juice, gomme syrup and - God help us - squid ink).</p> <p>Sake is far from the only drink to have undergone a fusion makeover. The rather austere taste of green tea, for example, is being combined with other ingredients such as ginger and honey to make it more palatable to western consumers eager to take advantage of its much publicised health benefits (it's a powerful antioxidant). Tea drinks are particularly popular in south-east Asia. Kombucha, a recently launched fermented tea drink infused with yeast cultures and lactobacilli, apparently dates back to 221BC, when it was first brewed up for the Japanese emperor. \"Its overall effect - an extended feeling of health - cannot be fully explained,\" intones the label mysteriously.</p> <p>Health is also the core appeal of isotonic drinks such as Lipovitan and the bizarrely named Pochari Sweat, which apparently sells a billion cans a year in Japan. Available from many Japanese stores such as the Japan Centre in Piccadilly, it has rather an odd taste - a bit like a dose of liver salts. More palatable is Calpico, an odd, chalky-looking lactic acid drink, which tastes like a watery, lemon-flavoured yoghurt.</p> <p>However unfamiliar we may find these flavours (though remember just how quickly we've taken to sushi), the reality is that an oriental name is just about enough to sell anything these days, particularly in the countries of the Pacific Rim. Midori, for example, an ultra-sweet melon liqueur that was originally Japanese but that is now produced in Mexico, is apparently the fourth biggest-selling liqueur in Australia, while Illusion (Midori, Triple Sec, vodka, pineapple and lemon juice) is the top-selling cocktail.</p> <p>Bearing that in mind, the next bartender's must-have could well be Jinro Soju, a sort of Korean vodka, which is apparently one of the top five spirits brands in the world.</p> <p>The irony is, of course, that while the west pursues its love affair with the east, the east regards the west as the ultimate arbiter of taste. For the wealthy Japanese, it's all about malt whisky, Cognac and bottles of Petrus. And bugger the lactobacilli</p> <p><b> SIX SLICK PACIFIC DRINKS</b></p> <p><b>Hakutsuru Japanese Excellent Sake (\u00a38.39, Oddbins)</b><br> Just what it says - a pukka Japanese sake that tastes like a low-alcohol cross between a fino sherry, a grappa and an unoaked malt whisky. Perfect for sushi. Drink chilled (as you should any decent sake).</p> <p><b> Momokawa Ruby Sake (\u00a35.99 Waitrose)</b><br> This modern Oregon-brewed sake, rated Best US Sake in 1999, has a flavour halfway between dank and delicate, according to the rather bizarre graph on the back label. Nice, though, and I love the blue bottle.</p> <p><b> Ume Shu Japanese Plum Sake (\u00a315.90, Arigato, Brewer Street, London W1; The Japan Centre, Piccadilly, London W1; and other specialist oriental grocers) </b><br>Popular with mixologists, this genuinely plum-flavoured sake is actually very good on its own. It would also make a fantastic dessert wine.</p> <p><b>Kombucha (\u00a31.55 for 250ml, Selfridges) </b><br>This plum-flavoured fermented tea drink is said to be a favourite of Barbra Streisand's, but don't let that put you off.</p> <p><b>Arizona Asia Plum Green Tea with Ginseng (\u00a31.59, Waitrose) </b><br>Yet more plum, I'm afraid, but it's comparably the best fusion flavour, at least for drinks. A green tea drink in a stunning bottle that would be great to puton the table for teetotlers at a Chinese or Japanese meal.</p>",

Vee tells me, when she finally pauses for breath, that she prefers the hot-house sake - \"It's good for my voice.\" Well, I wouldn't mind being able to sing as well as her, so that's a pretty strong recommendation. At the moment, flavoured sakes are mainly restricted to Japanese-inspired bars such as Yo! Below, Itsu and Nobu, but wait a few months and you'll see them everywhere - if you don't believe me, remember what happened to flavoured vodkas a few years back. Of course, the Japanese wouldn't touch them with a bargepole, but that doesn't really matter as much as you might think, because they're unlikely to be offered any in a neighbourhood Tokyo bar - these sakes are made in Oregon, where fusion flavours reign supreme. Curiously, it's actually cheaper for a sake producer to set up shop in the US, because the cost of rice there is about a quarter of that in Japan. Unsurprisingly, then, seven of the top Japanese brewers now have production facilities in the country - there is even a sake garden in the Napa Valley. Sake's principle appeal for the health-obsessed American public is that it is low in sulphur and doesn't give you a hangover. So great is its potential, in fact, that Griffith Frost of Sak\u00e9One in Oregon predicts that before long one in five glasses of wine consumed in the US will be a sake - roughly the same figure it currently accounts for globally. Given sake's rather unappealing flavour - at least, to western palates - that might seem a rather implausible, not to say over-optimistic claim, but Ian Haffety of Sheffield-based Distinctive Drinks Company, which distributes the Momokawa range, similarly reckons that the public will rapidly come round to Japan's national tipple. \"People might think that sake is disgusting,\" he admits, \"but then, how many of them would drink vodka or tequila straight? Very few. In cocktails, however, they're the biggest-selling drinks on the market. \"Most people have come across sake only in Japanese restaurants, where it's often very poor quality and served hot,\" continues Haffety. \"But there are lots and lots of different sakes - sweet, dry, unfiltered, flavoured - and you can be as creative with sake as you can with other spirits.\" Cocktails currently being intrepidly promoted by Haffety's company include the vivid blue Tounami (silver sake, blue Cura\u00e7ao, Bombay Sapphire gin, orgeat syrup and milk), Japanese Bulldog (pearl sake, Kahlua, cream and Coca-Cola) and Black Sea (silver sake, Bombay Sapphire, lemon juice, gomme syrup and - God help us - squid ink). Sake is far from the only drink to have undergone a fusion makeover. The rather austere taste of green tea, for example, is being combined with other ingredients such as ginger and honey to make it more palatable to western consumers eager to take advantage of its much publicised health benefits (it's a powerful antioxidant). Tea drinks are particularly popular in south-east Asia. Kombucha, a recently launched fermented tea drink infused with yeast cultures and lactobacilli, apparently dates back to 221BC, when it was first brewed up for the Japanese emperor. \"Its overall effect - an extended feeling of health - cannot be fully explained,\" intones the label mysteriously. Health is also the core appeal of isotonic drinks such as Lipovitan and the bizarrely named Pochari Sweat, which apparently sells a billion cans a year in Japan. Available from many Japanese stores such as the Japan Centre in Piccadilly, it has rather an odd taste - a bit like a dose of liver salts. More palatable is Calpico, an odd, chalky-looking lactic acid drink, which tastes like a watery, lemon-flavoured yoghurt. However unfamiliar we may find these flavours (though remember just how quickly we've taken to sushi), the reality is that an oriental name is just about enough to sell anything these days, particularly in the countries of the Pacific Rim. Midori, for example, an ultra-sweet melon liqueur that was originally Japanese but that is now produced in Mexico, is apparently the fourth biggest-selling liqueur in Australia, while Illusion (Midori, Triple Sec, vodka, pineapple and lemon juice) is the top-selling cocktail. Bearing that in mind, the next bartender's must-have could well be Jinro Soju, a sort of Korean vodka, which is apparently one of the top five spirits brands in the world. The irony is, of course, that while the west pursues its love affair with the east, the east regards the west as the ultimate arbiter of taste. For the wealthy Japanese, it's all about malt whisky, Cognac and bottles of Petrus. And bugger the lactobacilli SIX SLICK PACIFIC DRINKS Hakutsuru Japanese Excellent Sake (\u00a38.39, Oddbins) Just what it says - a pukka Japanese sake that tastes like a low-alcohol cross between a fino sherry, a grappa and an unoaked malt whisky. Perfect for sushi. Drink chilled (as you should any decent sake). Momokawa Ruby Sake (\u00a35.99 Waitrose) This modern Oregon-brewed sake, rated Best US Sake in 1999, has a flavour halfway between dank and delicate, according to the rather bizarre graph on the back label. Nice, though, and I love the blue bottle. Ume Shu Japanese Plum Sake (\u00a315.90, Arigato, Brewer Street, London W1; The Japan Centre, Piccadilly, London W1; and other specialist oriental grocers) Popular with mixologists, this genuinely plum-flavoured sake is actually very good on its own. It would also make a fantastic dessert wine. Kombucha (\u00a31.55 for 250ml, Selfridges) This plum-flavoured fermented tea drink is said to be a favourite of Barbra Streisand's, but don't let that put you off. Arizona Asia Plum Green Tea with Ginseng (\u00a31.59, Waitrose) Yet more plum, I'm afraid, but it's comparably the best fusion flavour, at least for drinks. A green tea drink in a stunning bottle that would be great to puton the table for teetotlers at a Chinese or Japanese meal.",

      "body": "<p>My father. Where does he end and where do I begin? I seem to have spent my whole life chasing his shadow, trying to answer the questions that so many fathers pose to their sons. Is my life predetermined by his? My future defined by my past? Is his story repeating itself through me, or am I the author of my own fate? Is he my father, or am I his son?</p> <p>He was hanged in Nigeria on November 10, 1995. On the morning of his execution, he was taken from his prison cell in a military camp in Port Harcourt, on the southern coast of Nigeria, and driven under armed escort to a nearby prison. It took five attempts to hang him. His corpse was dumped in an unmarked grave; acid was poured on his remains and soldiers posted outside the cemetery.</p> <p>Ken Saro-Wiwa's execution triggered a tidal wave of outrage that swept around the world. John Major, then British prime minister, described my father's execution as \"judicial murder\" and the military tribunal that sentenced him to death as a \"fraudulent trial, a bad verdict, an unjust sentence\". Nelson Mandela declared that \"this heinous act by the Nigerian authorities flies in the face of appeals by the world community for a stay of execution\". World figures, including Bill Clinton and the Queen, joined the worldwide condemnation of Nigeria's military dictator, General Sani Abacha. Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth; countries recalled their diplomats, and there were widespread calls for economic sanctions. There were candlelit vigils and demonstrations outside Nigerian embassies and at Shell Oil stations and offices.</p> <p>My father's death was front-page news around the world. Letters and tributes poured in from every continent, and Ken Saro-Wiwa was canonised in hastily prepared obituaries that were often littered with errors. A man whom few people had heard of 24 hours earlier was suddenly invested with a mythic quality, and his campaign against Shell Oil, and their mines on Ogoni lands, and a ruthless military regime was being touted as a morality tale for the late 20th century.</p> <p>I had a difficult and troubled relationship with my father, and although he was rarely around, I grew up in awe of him, intimidated by his achievements and haunted by the passions he stirred in both men and women.</p> <p>I never forgot the day he decided to let me in on the meaning of his and my life. We were driving around Port Harcourt and he was showing me around his business empire. Everything, he revealed, was for one purpose: to secure justice for our people. His books, the properties, the businesses - everything was subservient to his hopes and ambitions for our people. As we drove along the main road in the city, he outlined his vision of the future, and I sank lower and lower in the passenger seat. He was in the driving seat, his eyes firmly fixed on the road ahead, his horizons expanding as he outlined his vision. When he had mapped out my future, he glanced over and saw me looking grim-faced, my chin buried in my chest.</p> <p>\"You know you won't inherit my enemies,\" he said, trying to reassure me with a thin, unconvincing smile.</p> <p>I was 14 years old and I had no idea what he was talking about or which enemies he was referring to, but those words planted the notion in my mind that being Ken Saro-Wiwa's first son and namesake was a complicated and heavy burden.</p> <p>I would love to know what my father was thinking when he named me. My full name is Kenule Bornale Saro-Wiwa. It means \"In troubled times, I am fearless - the first son of Wiwa\". Perhaps my father took it as a good omen that, like him, his first son was born during a war. I sometimes imagine, in more cynical moments, that he looked into my eyes on November 28, 1968, and saw a reflection of himself.</p> <p>One of my earliest photographs shows me standing on a balcony, looking slightly surprised, a little unsteady on my feet. On the back of the photograph, my father has written, \"Kenule Bornale Tsaroti, first steps, aged seven months\". Since my father also walked at seven months, I imagine him staring at that photograph, beaming with pride, his pen poised to mark the milestone, excited at the thought that his first son and namesake is already following in his footsteps.</p> <p>At home I have always been known as Junior, but I was surprised when my father took me aside and told me, as we were preparing to leave for England, that my name was actually Kenule. I had never wondered why I was called Junior, but I loved the name because it made me stand out from all my friends, who had dull Nigerian names like Ibinabo, Nwachuwkwu or Dike. I was distinctly unimpressed by Kenule, and I told my father so. But he was adamant. Kenule was my name, and I was now to answer to it.</p> <p>England offered me refuge from the implications that being Ken Saro-Wiwa's son had in Nigeria, but it couldn't protect me from the complexities of being my father's son, especially after I became conscious of the fact that he was trying to mould me in his image. When he insisted that I follow his example and cut my hair, polish my shoes, iron my shirts, take pride and care in my appearance, I did the opposite. I resisted him, cutting off my nose to spite any traces of him in my face. But as long as he was paying my school fees, giving me the best opportunities in life, I couldn't rebel against him like my English friends did their fathers. I misspent my youth cautiously instead, nursing my resentment of my father's ambitions for me.</p> <p>My father could never understand why I was such an introspective, uncommunicative slouch around the house, especially when my school reports suggested I was \"outgoing\" and \"gregarious\". He started nosing around my life, invading my privacy, trying to understand what, if anything, was going on in my head.</p> <p>I once caught him reading my diary. He was standing by my bed, casually flicking through it. He didn't apologise, just carried on reading as if I wasn't there. I was livid, but I didn't protest: in our culture, as he was always quick to remind us, you never argue with your elders. I stopped writing the diary, but that didn't stop him from prying. He started opening every letter that was addressed to Ken Saro-Wiwa, even though it was not that difficult to work out which were his and which were mine. I retreated further into myself, slyly resisting the straitjacket of identity my father was trying to impose on me and dreaming of the day when I would take control of my life and change my name.</p> <p>I was 23 years old when I finally did it. I instructed a solicitor to draw up the documents, and in a lavish flourish of my new, shortened signature, I declared my independence from him and became Ken Wiwa. It wasn't the liberating experience I had hoped, though. Ken Wiwa seemed flat, rather unimpressive, especially next to the more colourful and flamboyant Ken Saro-Wiwa.</p> <p>It took me two years to break the news to my father. He was in detention by then, and when I wrote to him, I deliberately signed myself Ken Wiwa instead of Junior, as I had always done in the past.</p> <p>He was furious.</p> <p>He wrote back, complaining that \"nobody will ever know that you're my son\". At least that's how I used to tell the story. When I re-read the letter after he died, I saw that what he had actually written was a more anguished, \"there is no way in our culture that Ken Wiwa can be the son of Ken Saro-Wiwa\".</p> <p>Which, linguistically at least, is not true.</p> <p>One of the few times I ever stood up to my father was in Los Angeles in 1982. We were on holiday, travelling around the US. He had decided to take me and Gian, my younger brother, on a whirlwind, two-week sightseeing tour of six cities. \"I'm training you,\" he explained one day in Miami, after we protested that we couldn't survive on one meal a day. By the time we got to Los Angeles, we couldn't stand any more of his training regime, and we decided to mutiny. When he gave us some money and packed us off to Disneyland, we spent the whole day sunbathing and comparing fantasies of how we would kill him. We decided that when we returned to the hotel that evening, we would pointedly watch television instead of reading a book as he insisted we do every night.</p> <p>When the revolutionary moment came, I switched the television on, but Gian got cold feet and carried on reading. I was mortified but kept watching the television. I was wary of the silent, brooding figure lying on the bed behind me, however. \"My friend, turn that telly off and read your book,\" he bellowed. I picked up my book, flung it down in front of him and stormed off. I barricaded myself in the bathroom. And waited. And waited. After a few minutes I heard my father gently encouraging, then praising, Gian for reciting the poem he had made us memorise when we began the holiday:</p> <p>The heights by great men reached and kept</p> <p>Were not attained by sudden flight,</p> <p>But they, while their companions slept,</p> <p>Were toiling upward in the night</p> <p>When I couldn't stand the shame any longer, I crept out of the bathroom. \"Come here,\" my father barked at me. \"Kneel down,\" he growled. I knelt at the foot of the bed and he tossed me a copy of the Bible. \"Where in the Holy Bible,\" he said, pointing to the Gideon with his chin, \"does it say you should disobey your father?\" I thumbed the Bible half-heartedly. He repeated the question. Twice. I burst into tears. \"Aw, take it like a man,\" he griped. That night, I went to sleep convinced I was going to kill him before the holiday ended.</p> <p>The next day, he was all smiles. I was suspicious at first, but when he treated us to hamburgers for lunch, everything was forgiven. As we walked around the city centre after lunch, Gian and I were following a few steps behind my father, taking it in turns to re-enact and exorcise the previous night's drama. \"Where in the Holy Bible does it say you should disobey your father?\" we bellowed, mimicking his heavy African accent and repeating the question louder and more boldly as he walked ahead in silence. As we passed a window, I saw his face reflected in the glass. He was grinning.</p> <p>Although I was relieved, I was also baffled. It was only much later, when I was in Johannesburg two years after his death, that I finally understood why he was smiling that day in Los Angeles.</p> <p>I was hosting a round table of Nigerian pro-democracy activists in exile. Someone suggested that Ken Saro-Wiwa had been wrong to insist on non-violence as the best way to confront a vicious military regime. Most of the participants were adamant that pacifism was futile in the Nigerian context, that Abacha had given my father an emphatic answer to the efficacy of non-violence.</p> <p>One of the exiles disagreed. \"Ken Saro-Wiwa came to lecture at our university once,\" he recalled, \"and we put this very same question to him. And Ken replied that it was just like challenging your father. Your father is too strong, so you have to outwit him with your brains.\"</p> <p>The problem with fathers is that by the time you finally understand them, it is too late. As Mark Twain noted, when you're 14 your father is the most ignorant man you know. By the time you're 21 you're surprised at how much the old man has learned in seven years.</p> <p>I would love to know what was on my father's mind when he named my youngest brother Tedum Tambari. Loosely translated it means \"the tree of life, the one sent to do God's work\". I don't know what sort of expectations my father had of Tedum, but he turned out to be the kind of son he had always wanted.</p> <p>I didn't take much notice of Tedum at first. He ate. He slept. He cried. But mostly he ate. He had an uncanny knack of knowing when it was time to eat. You would just be settling down for supper, taking advantage of a moment's peace around the house while the baby slept, and he would start crying. The little man, as I later came to call him, loved his food. He especially loved African food, which was unusual for someone who was born and brought up in England. Tedum was proof that Africa is in the blood, because he loved going back to Nigeria. While the rest of his brothers and sisters were barricading themselves in air-conditioned rooms, Tedum was outside, soaking up the sun, feeling right at home.</p> <p>Everyone, especially my mother, loved my little brother. Nene [affectionate name for mother] needed something to hold on to because when we moved to England, she had to raise five kids on her own while adjusting to life in a foreign country and squeezing in a degree in her spare time.</p> <p>The first time I realised she was unhappy was when I walked into the bathroom one day and almost choked on the pungent mix of tobacco and air freshener in the room. She hardly touched a drink, let alone cigarettes. Although she tried to conceal it from us, we all knew. It wasn't the first time my father had strayed. Years later, Nene would tell me that friends had often warned her. But she was prepared to put up with his infidelities as long as he remained faithful to the family.</p> <p>I'd always been aware that my parents fought over his \"other women\". I must have been about four years old when Nene came back from boarding school and I heard my parents arguing. I was listening from my bedroom when my mother suddenly burst in. \"Junior,\" she rasped, her chest heaving with rage, \"has someone been in this house while I was away?\" He often had women over in the evenings, especially when Nene was away at school, but as she stood in the doorway, I had a feeling my answer might have serious repercussions.</p> <p>I told her I hadn't seen anyone in the house. She asked me if I was sure, repeating the question slowly and deliberately. I was gripped by a kind of terror I had never felt before. I didn't want to lie to her, but I also wanted to protect my father. More than anything, I wanted to keep the peace. I imagined that a no would somehow diffuse the tension. My mother stormed out and I lay on my bed, tormented by guilt as my parents carried on fighting.</p> <p>Although I felt it was my job to protect my mother from my father, I never truly offered her much protection from him. I never dared challenge my father, because each time I announced that I was ready to disown him, Nene would beg me to reconsider. \"He loves you, you know,\" she would say, warning me never to turn my back on him.</p> <p>Tedum was the only one who stood up to him.</p> <p>My little brother was 10 years younger than me, and I only began to take an interest in him when he started pestering me to play football and cricket. We became very close, although he was close to all his brothers and sisters. He was my parents' favourite, especially after he fulfilled my father's ambition to send a son to Eton College.</p> <p>I remember seeing him at Christmas, when I went down to our home outside London. Tedum was in festive spirits, especially after he thrashed me at table football for the first time. I took it on the chin, smiling ruefully. I was proud of him. I sensed that the dynamics of our relationship were changing. On New Year's Eve, I went back to my flat. Tedum saw me out of the house. As he closed the door, I vividly remember the smug grin and knowing look on his face. It was the last time I ever saw the little man.</p> <p>March 15, the ides of March, was a sunny day, the first day of spring, and the daffodils were out. I remember every detail of that day. I rang my girlfriend Olivia in the morning and we arranged to meet at my flat later that evening. I was coming to the end of my media course at journalism school. I remember sitting on a lawn at college, laughing and joking with my friends that afternoon. At about 4pm there was a chill in the air. I went inside, pottered around for a couple of hours, then left for my flat. After about 20 minutes, the doorbell rang. It was Olivia. A few minutes after she arrived, the phone rang. Mike, my flatmate, took the call.</p> <p>\"Someone wants to speak to Mr Saro-Wiwa,\" he said, announcing my name with exaggerated formality as he handed the phone to me.</p> <p>\"Hello? Mr Saro-Wiwa?\"</p> <p>\"Yes?\" I answered.</p> <p>\"It's Mr Wright here.\"</p> <p>My mind went blank.</p> <p>\"I'm Tedum's housemaster at Eton,\" the voice explained. \"I've, err, got some very bad news, I'm afraid.\"</p> <p>What had Tedum done? Has he been expelled? Smoking? Drugs?</p> <p>\"I'm afraid Tedum is dead,\" he said, interrupting my train of thought.</p> <p>\"What?\" I gasped.</p> <p>\"Tedum was playing the field game,\" Mr Wright began to explain. \"He played really well, as usual.\" I just kept shaking my head, saying no, no, no. I wanted to drop the phone. \"At the end of the game, Tedum said he felt a swelling in his left ankle,\" Mr Wright continued, determined to provide me with all the facts. \"He went to sit down by a tree. He said he felt dizzy and thirsty. A friend ran to get him some water. By the time his friend came back, Tedum was lying on the ground unconscious. An ambulance arrived on the scene within minutes. The paramedics spent 45 minutes trying to revive him. I'm sorry.\"</p> <p>I hung up and collapsed on the floor. I was absolutely devastated. He was 14 years old, with so much potential, so much to live for, and he was dead. I broke down, overcome as much by grief as by an overwhelming sense of guilt. \"Tedum is dead,\" I kept repeating, as if trying to convince myself. One minute he had been full of life and now he was dead, at 14, of a heart attack. It just didn't add up. It was impossible. I was desperately trying to gather my thoughts when the phone rang again. It was Mr Wright. \"I just wanted to give you some more details, Ken. I've spoken to your parents in Nigeria and they are on their way. Tedum's body is in the mortuary but we will wait for your father to arrive before we do anything else. I'm sorry, Ken. Good night.\"</p> <p>I grabbed a pack of cigarettes and went for a walk, taking the same route Tedum and I had walked to watch his first football match just three months earlier. I couldn't believe that the strapping, gawky kid who was so looking forward to his first match was now lying in a mortuary. I sat on the pavement on the corner of Fulham Road. All kinds of thoughts were swimming around my mind. Nene ... I felt so desperately sorry for her; I felt impotent, unable to help her once again. She was so far away from the little boy she had pinned so much hope on. My sisters ... Christ, I thought. I hadn't even spoken to them. I rushed back to my flat and dialled a Brighton number.</p> <p>Noo was the first to come to the phone. Then Zina. Neither of them had been told. My father had instructed their teachers not to tell them until he arrived in England. He had wanted to break the news to them himself. The next day, Tedum's death was reported in the papers: \"The son of a wealthy Nigerian businessman died tragically at Eton College yesterday.\" I can't imagine how my sisters would have felt it they had found out from the newspaper. My father was just too far away to understand or appreciate some things.</p> <p>I went home the next day. He had arrived from Nigeria but was alone in the house. \"Where's Nene?\" I barked at him. He told me she was arriving later. I was incensed that they hadn't flown together. He glared at me as if to suggest that it was none of my business. An uneasy silence fell over the house and it didn't break until three days later, when we were heading home from the mortuary after seeing Tedum's body. My father was driving and I was in the passenger seat; my mother and my sisters were in the back. The atmosphere was unbearable: there was grief, resentment and anger in the air. When my father wondered aloud whether the campaign against Shell might not have had something to do with Tedum's death, my sisters and I exploded in unison. We told him to keep his politics out of Tedum's death.</p> <p>Although his concern was at the forefront of our minds as well, we didn't want him to bring it up. \"I'm just trying to protect the rest of you,\" he protested, but we ganged up on him again. He was surprised by the strength of feeling in the ranks. He fell silent, stuffed his pipe in his mouth and started puffing away, popping his lips furiously.</p> <p>Looking back on it, I feel sorry for him. It was as if his children were telling him that he had forfeited his right to be their father. We had willingly given up our father to his political commitment, but we were desperately trying to resist the notion that his politics might invade, jeopardise and compromise our privacy, and even our lives.</p> <p>After the funeral, we went back to Eton to plant a tree near the spot where Tedum had died. We walked back to the car, my father leading the way, his family trailing behind him. He had completely withdrawn from the process by then, and he was conscious that I disapproved. He was probably desperate to go back to Nigeria; in England, he was a stranger in his own house, and he was being made to feel guilty about his shortcomings as the head of his family. In Nigeria, on the other hand, he was being hailed as the father of his people. He could do no wrong there.</p> <p>He looked a mess as he trudged back to the car through the muddy field. He was wearing a long, shabby brown fur coat, the hem of which almost touched the wet grass. As he walked along he suddenly kicked the air in frustration. I don't know why but I just had this feeling that he only did it for my benefit, to show me that he did care.</p> <p>It took me a long time to reconcile myself to the guilt I felt that Tedum had died instead of me. Tests later showed that I had a milder form of the congenital disease that killed him. I had an operation that summer, but I couldn't sleep for months after Tedum died. Nene spooked me when she told me that she had had a vivid dream before she travelled to Nigeria. She dreamt that one of our ancestors came to take me away, but she had pleaded so hard for me that they took Tedum instead.</p> <p>On the night before Tedum's funeral, Zina, Noo and I had sat in his bedroom talking about our little brother. Noo recalled how Tedum had once made my father cry.</p> <p>\"How did he do that?!\" I exclaimed.</p> <p>\"Oh, he just confronted him about Nene, and Jeje broke down.\"</p> <p>I was astonished. My little brother had done what I should have been doing all along, protecting Nene from my father. I was proud of the little man, and embarrassed for myself. The next day, as I scattered earth over Tedum's coffin, I paused and made a silent promise to him.</p> <p>In many, many ways, Tedum's death was the turning point in my life. Trying to make sense of it, I began to look into the ways Africans deal with death, and I came to understand that my little brother was a spirit child. A spirit child is born and reborn many times, moving between the spirit world and the real world. When a spirit child is recalled, he has to go, and thus spirit children often die in childbirth or at a young age. Ben Okri's wonderful evocation of childhood, The Famished Road, tells the story of Azaro Lazarus - a spirit child who refuses to return to the spirit world when his time is up.</p> <p>While I had seen myself as Tedum's substitute father and mentor, I came to appreciate that he had actually been my guiding angel, a spirit child, the son that shone over my father's house. He kept the house warm, comforting my mother until his time was up. Tedum Tambari, the tree of life, the one sent to do God's work, left us just as storm clouds gathered over Ken Saro-Wiwa's house.</p> <p>He came over to London again at Christmas. It was our first Christmas since Tedum's death, and I hoped it would help to get out of the usual routine at my parents' home. My father turned down my invitation, explaining that he would rather fast for our people, that we had no right to enjoy a meal while our people were suffering. I took the snub as it was intended - as a protest against my apolitical stance, but I felt the family needed to come first.The next time I saw him was in the New Year. By then my brother Gian, who had suffered a breakdown in Nigeria two years earlier, had returned to England to get treatment after having a relapse and contracting malaria. Gian was in a terrible state. He was wasted from the malaria, and he was severely agitated by his experiences in Nigeria. Arrangements were made for my father to visit Gian's doctor so they could establish the cause of my brother's relapse. I saw Gian on the day of the scheduled appointment. When I asked his doctor how the meeting with my father had gone, the doctor shook his head.</p> <p>\"He never turned up.\"</p> <p>\"What? What do you mean?\" I snapped.</p> <p>\"He didn't make the appointment. We waited for him, but your father never showed up.\"</p> <p>When I left the hospital, I was determined to give him a piece of my mind. But when I arrived at home, he wasn't there. My mother was in the kitchen, and when I told her what had happened at the hospital she sighed. A few minutes later, he shuffled wearily into the house. His tie was hanging loosely around his neck, the old brown coat looked shabbier than ever, and he was struggling with a pile of documents. He paused in the doorway when he saw me, smiled nervously, and walked into the sitting room.</p> <p>\"Have you been to see Gian?\" I barked at his back, following him into the lounge. He hauled his briefcase onto the dining table, took off his coat and glared at me. I stared him down and he backed off. He sat down and started rifling through the papers on the table. He looked broken, almost pitiful, as he absent-mindedly patted the documents strewn on the table. After a few moments, he glanced up at me plaintively. That look is frozen in my mind. It still haunts me, because I suddenly saw through my father. His hair was matted, there were flecks of grey stubble on his chin, and his eyes looked tired and bloodshot. In that moment, I saw my father for what he was: an old man struggling to meet the incredible personal and political demands on him.</p> <p>My anger began to dissolve. A little voice was urging me to confront him, but another voice insisted I leave him alone. I hovered between anger and guilt for a few seconds. Then, cursing under my breath, I walked away. He was staring at the wreckage of his life scattered across the dining table as I left. It was the last time I ever saw my father.</p> <p>That we parted on such a bad note is one of my greatest regrets. But when I stormed out of the house that afternoon in January 1994, we were poles apart. I didn't understand him; I just couldn't see how he could be leading a struggle that he said was for the future, for us, his children, while he neglected those children's immediate needs and wellbeing. That afternoon, I only understood that his youngest son was dead and another was fighting for his life in hospital, and that all he seemed to care about was his political campaign. I saw a pattern developing, and I didn't want to sacrifice my life for his political conscience. So I turned my back on him.</p> <p>A week later, he went back to Nigeria, leaving the battle on his homefront for another war.</p> <p>It was past midnight when I heard the news. The phone rang at my flat in west London. My mother was on the other end. I knew it was bad news.</p> <p>\"Junior!\" she whispered. \"Tanga le be-e!\"</p> <p>There is trouble at home. My heart sank.</p> <p>I had a numb, sickening feeling that life wouldn't be the same again. Four Ogoni Chiefs - Albert Badey, Tom Orage, Sam Orage and Edward Kobani - were dead, and my father had been arrested in connection with their murders. One of the murdered men, Sam Orage, was my uncle. He was the husband of my aunt Elizabeth, my mother's oldest sister. Images of my cousins Barine, Tom, Desmond and Tuma flashed up in my mind's eye. What kind of sick twist of fate could have brought this on my family, I wondered. I couldn't imagine why or how my father could be implicated in the murder of his friend Edward Kobani, the father of my childhood friends Tombari and Edward.</p> <p>I paced around in a daze, trying to understand the news. But it just didn't make sense. I hadn't been following events in Ogoni, and I had no idea of what had been going on down there. To my apolitical and distanced mind the violence seemed so out of place, out of character, for the Ogoni I knew. It seemed like the kind of senseless butchering that you read about in places like Rwanda. The Ogoni I knew was a docile, peaceful place.</p> <p>The most distressing part of it was that the murders split my family right down the middle. On one side was my father's family and on the other was my mother's. Family ties and loyalties were suddenly stretched. Childhood friends, favourite cousins, would now be separated by a blood feud. As I paced, I tried to figure out what to do. Make the wrong move, say the wrong thing, and it would have far-reaching, emotionally wrenching consequences.</p> <p>In such circumstances all you can do is trust your instincts. I picked up the phone and dialled a number in Los Angeles. My cousin Desmond Orage answered. He could barely speak.</p> <p>\"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry,\" was all I managed to say. There we were, two cousins who had been making plans to meet up in Los Angeles in a few months' time, but now his father had been hacked to death by a mob and my father was alleged to have ordered the killing.</p> <p>\u0095 Read the second part of this article <a href=\"http://gnome.theguardian.com/Books/extracts/story/0,6761,388922,00.html\"> here </a></p> <p>\u0095 Extracted from The Shadow of a Saint by Ken Wiwa, published by Doubleday on 2nd November priced \u00a316.99.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My father. Where does he end and where do I begin? I seem to have spent my whole life chasing his shadow, trying to answer the questions that so many fathers pose to their sons. Is my life predetermined by his? My future defined by my past? Is his story repeating itself through me, or am I the author of my own fate? Is he my father, or am I his son? He was hanged in Nigeria on November 10, 1995. On the morning of his execution, he was taken from his prison cell in a military camp in Port Harcourt, on the southern coast of Nigeria, and driven under armed escort to a nearby prison. It took five attempts to hang him. His corpse was dumped in an unmarked grave; acid was poured on his remains and soldiers posted outside the cemetery. Ken Saro-Wiwa's execution triggered a tidal wave of outrage that swept around the world. John Major, then British prime minister, described my father's execution as \"judicial murder\" and the military tribunal that sentenced him to death as a \"fraudulent trial, a bad verdict, an unjust sentence\". Nelson Mandela declared that \"this heinous act by the Nigerian authorities flies in the face of appeals by the world community for a stay of execution\". World figures, including Bill Clinton and the Queen, joined the worldwide condemnation of Nigeria's military dictator, General Sani Abacha. Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth; countries recalled their diplomats, and there were widespread calls for economic sanctions. There were candlelit vigils and demonstrations outside Nigerian embassies and at Shell Oil stations and offices. My father's death was front-page news around the world. Letters and tributes poured in from every continent, and Ken Saro-Wiwa was canonised in hastily prepared obituaries that were often littered with errors. A man whom few people had heard of 24 hours earlier was suddenly invested with a mythic quality, and his campaign against Shell Oil, and their mines on Ogoni lands, and a ruthless military regime was being touted as a morality tale for the late 20th century. I had a difficult and troubled relationship with my father, and although he was rarely around, I grew up in awe of him, intimidated by his achievements and haunted by the passions he stirred in both men and women. I never forgot the day he decided to let me in on the meaning of his and my life. We were driving around Port Harcourt and he was showing me around his business empire. Everything, he revealed, was for one purpose: to secure justice for our people. His books, the properties, the businesses - everything was subservient to his hopes and ambitions for our people. As we drove along the main road in the city, he outlined his vision of the future, and I sank lower and lower in the passenger seat. He was in the driving seat, his eyes firmly fixed on the road ahead, his horizons expanding as he outlined his vision. When he had mapped out my future, he glanced over and saw me looking grim-faced, my chin buried in my chest. \"You know you won't inherit my enemies,\" he said, trying to reassure me with a thin, unconvincing smile. I was 14 years old and I had no idea what he was talking about or which enemies he was referring to, but those words planted the notion in my mind that being Ken Saro-Wiwa's first son and namesake was a complicated and heavy burden. I would love to know what my father was thinking when he named me. My full name is Kenule Bornale Saro-Wiwa. It means \"In troubled times, I am fearless - the first son of Wiwa\". Perhaps my father took it as a good omen that, like him, his first son was born during a war. I sometimes imagine, in more cynical moments, that he looked into my eyes on November 28, 1968, and saw a reflection of himself. One of my earliest photographs shows me standing on a balcony, looking slightly surprised, a little unsteady on my feet. On the back of the photograph, my father has written, \"Kenule Bornale Tsaroti, first steps, aged seven months\". Since my father also walked at seven months, I imagine him staring at that photograph, beaming with pride, his pen poised to mark the milestone, excited at the thought that his first son and namesake is already following in his footsteps. At home I have always been known as Junior, but I was surprised when my father took me aside and told me, as we were preparing to leave for England, that my name was actually Kenule. I had never wondered why I was called Junior, but I loved the name because it made me stand out from all my friends, who had dull Nigerian names like Ibinabo, Nwachuwkwu or Dike. I was distinctly unimpressed by Kenule, and I told my father so. But he was adamant. Kenule was my name, and I was now to answer to it. England offered me refuge from the implications that being Ken Saro-Wiwa's son had in Nigeria, but it couldn't protect me from the complexities of being my father's son, especially after I became conscious of the fact that he was trying to mould me in his image. When he insisted that I follow his example and cut my hair, polish my shoes, iron my shirts, take pride and care in my appearance, I did the opposite. I resisted him, cutting off my nose to spite any traces of him in my face. But as long as he was paying my school fees, giving me the best opportunities in life, I couldn't rebel against him like my English friends did their fathers. I misspent my youth cautiously instead, nursing my resentment of my father's ambitions for me. My father could never understand why I was such an introspective, uncommunicative slouch around the house, especially when my school reports suggested I was \"outgoing\" and \"gregarious\". He started nosing around my life, invading my privacy, trying to understand what, if anything, was going on in my head. I once caught him reading my diary. He was standing by my bed, casually flicking through it. He didn't apologise, just carried on reading as if I wasn't there. I was livid, but I didn't protest: in our culture, as he was always quick to remind us, you never argue with your elders. I stopped writing the diary, but that didn't stop him from prying. He started opening every letter that was addressed to Ken Saro-Wiwa, even though it was not that difficult to work out which were his and which were mine. I retreated further into myself, slyly resisting the straitjacket of identity my father was trying to impose on me and dreaming of the day when I would take control of my life and change my name. I was 23 years old when I finally did it. I instructed a solicitor to draw up the documents, and in a lavish flourish of my new, shortened signature, I declared my independence from him and became Ken Wiwa. It wasn't the liberating experience I had hoped, though. Ken Wiwa seemed flat, rather unimpressive, especially next to the more colourful and flamboyant Ken Saro-Wiwa. It took me two years to break the news to my father. He was in detention by then, and when I wrote to him, I deliberately signed myself Ken Wiwa instead of Junior, as I had always done in the past. He was furious. He wrote back, complaining that \"nobody will ever know that you're my son\". At least that's how I used to tell the story. When I re-read the letter after he died, I saw that what he had actually written was a more anguished, \"there is no way in our culture that Ken Wiwa can be the son of Ken Saro-Wiwa\". Which, linguistically at least, is not true. One of the few times I ever stood up to my father was in Los Angeles in 1982. We were on holiday, travelling around the US. He had decided to take me and Gian, my younger brother, on a whirlwind, two-week sightseeing tour of six cities. \"I'm training you,\" he explained one day in Miami, after we protested that we couldn't survive on one meal a day. By the time we got to Los Angeles, we couldn't stand any more of his training regime, and we decided to mutiny. When he gave us some money and packed us off to Disneyland, we spent the whole day sunbathing and comparing fantasies of how we would kill him. We decided that when we returned to the hotel that evening, we would pointedly watch television instead of reading a book as he insisted we do every night. When the revolutionary moment came, I switched the television on, but Gian got cold feet and carried on reading. I was mortified but kept watching the television. I was wary of the silent, brooding figure lying on the bed behind me, however. \"My friend, turn that telly off and read your book,\" he bellowed. I picked up my book, flung it down in front of him and stormed off. I barricaded myself in the bathroom. And waited. And waited. After a few minutes I heard my father gently encouraging, then praising, Gian for reciting the poem he had made us memorise when we began the holiday: The heights by great men reached and kept Were not attained by sudden flight, But they, while their companions slept, Were toiling upward in the night When I couldn't stand the shame any longer, I crept out of the bathroom. \"Come here,\" my father barked at me. \"Kneel down,\" he growled. I knelt at the foot of the bed and he tossed me a copy of the Bible. \"Where in the Holy Bible,\" he said, pointing to the Gideon with his chin, \"does it say you should disobey your father?\" I thumbed the Bible half-heartedly. He repeated the question. Twice. I burst into tears. \"Aw, take it like a man,\" he griped. That night, I went to sleep convinced I was going to kill him before the holiday ended. The next day, he was all smiles. I was suspicious at first, but when he treated us to hamburgers for lunch, everything was forgiven. As we walked around the city centre after lunch, Gian and I were following a few steps behind my father, taking it in turns to re-enact and exorcise the previous night's drama. \"Where in the Holy Bible does it say you should disobey your father?\" we bellowed, mimicking his heavy African accent and repeating the question louder and more boldly as he walked ahead in silence. As we passed a window, I saw his face reflected in the glass. He was grinning. Although I was relieved, I was also baffled. It was only much later, when I was in Johannesburg two years after his death, that I finally understood why he was smiling that day in Los Angeles. I was hosting a round table of Nigerian pro-democracy activists in exile. Someone suggested that Ken Saro-Wiwa had been wrong to insist on non-violence as the best way to confront a vicious military regime. Most of the participants were adamant that pacifism was futile in the Nigerian context, that Abacha had given my father an emphatic answer to the efficacy of non-violence. One of the exiles disagreed. \"Ken Saro-Wiwa came to lecture at our university once,\" he recalled, \"and we put this very same question to him. And Ken replied that it was just like challenging your father. Your father is too strong, so you have to outwit him with your brains.\" The problem with fathers is that by the time you finally understand them, it is too late. As Mark Twain noted, when you're 14 your father is the most ignorant man you know. By the time you're 21 you're surprised at how much the old man has learned in seven years. I would love to know what was on my father's mind when he named my youngest brother Tedum Tambari. Loosely translated it means \"the tree of life, the one sent to do God's work\". I don't know what sort of expectations my father had of Tedum, but he turned out to be the kind of son he had always wanted. I didn't take much notice of Tedum at first. He ate. He slept. He cried. But mostly he ate. He had an uncanny knack of knowing when it was time to eat. You would just be settling down for supper, taking advantage of a moment's peace around the house while the baby slept, and he would start crying. The little man, as I later came to call him, loved his food. He especially loved African food, which was unusual for someone who was born and brought up in England. Tedum was proof that Africa is in the blood, because he loved going back to Nigeria. While the rest of his brothers and sisters were barricading themselves in air-conditioned rooms, Tedum was outside, soaking up the sun, feeling right at home. Everyone, especially my mother, loved my little brother. Nene [affectionate name for mother] needed something to hold on to because when we moved to England, she had to raise five kids on her own while adjusting to life in a foreign country and squeezing in a degree in her spare time. The first time I realised she was unhappy was when I walked into the bathroom one day and almost choked on the pungent mix of tobacco and air freshener in the room. She hardly touched a drink, let alone cigarettes. Although she tried to conceal it from us, we all knew. It wasn't the first time my father had strayed. Years later, Nene would tell me that friends had often warned her. But she was prepared to put up with his infidelities as long as he remained faithful to the family. I'd always been aware that my parents fought over his \"other women\". I must have been about four years old when Nene came back from boarding school and I heard my parents arguing. I was listening from my bedroom when my mother suddenly burst in. \"Junior,\" she rasped, her chest heaving with rage, \"has someone been in this house while I was away?\" He often had women over in the evenings, especially when Nene was away at school, but as she stood in the doorway, I had a feeling my answer might have serious repercussions. I told her I hadn't seen anyone in the house. She asked me if I was sure, repeating the question slowly and deliberately. I was gripped by a kind of terror I had never felt before. I didn't want to lie to her, but I also wanted to protect my father. More than anything, I wanted to keep the peace. I imagined that a no would somehow diffuse the tension. My mother stormed out and I lay on my bed, tormented by guilt as my parents carried on fighting. Although I felt it was my job to protect my mother from my father, I never truly offered her much protection from him. I never dared challenge my father, because each time I announced that I was ready to disown him, Nene would beg me to reconsider. \"He loves you, you know,\" she would say, warning me never to turn my back on him. Tedum was the only one who stood up to him. My little brother was 10 years younger than me, and I only began to take an interest in him when he started pestering me to play football and cricket. We became very close, although he was close to all his brothers and sisters. He was my parents' favourite, especially after he fulfilled my father's ambition to send a son to Eton College. I remember seeing him at Christmas, when I went down to our home outside London. Tedum was in festive spirits, especially after he thrashed me at table football for the first time. I took it on the chin, smiling ruefully. I was proud of him. I sensed that the dynamics of our relationship were changing. On New Year's Eve, I went back to my flat. Tedum saw me out of the house. As he closed the door, I vividly remember the smug grin and knowing look on his face. It was the last time I ever saw the little man. March 15, the ides of March, was a sunny day, the first day of spring, and the daffodils were out. I remember every detail of that day. I rang my girlfriend Olivia in the morning and we arranged to meet at my flat later that evening. I was coming to the end of my media course at journalism school. I remember sitting on a lawn at college, laughing and joking with my friends that afternoon. At about 4pm there was a chill in the air. I went inside, pottered around for a couple of hours, then left for my flat. After about 20 minutes, the doorbell rang. It was Olivia. A few minutes after she arrived, the phone rang. Mike, my flatmate, took the call. \"Someone wants to speak to Mr Saro-Wiwa,\" he said, announcing my name with exaggerated formality as he handed the phone to me. \"Hello? Mr Saro-Wiwa?\" \"Yes?\" I answered. \"It's Mr Wright here.\" My mind went blank. \"I'm Tedum's housemaster at Eton,\" the voice explained. \"I've, err, got some very bad news, I'm afraid.\" What had Tedum done? Has he been expelled? Smoking? Drugs? \"I'm afraid Tedum is dead,\" he said, interrupting my train of thought. \"What?\" I gasped. \"Tedum was playing the field game,\" Mr Wright began to explain. \"He played really well, as usual.\" I just kept shaking my head, saying no, no, no. I wanted to drop the phone. \"At the end of the game, Tedum said he felt a swelling in his left ankle,\" Mr Wright continued, determined to provide me with all the facts. \"He went to sit down by a tree. He said he felt dizzy and thirsty. A friend ran to get him some water. By the time his friend came back, Tedum was lying on the ground unconscious. An ambulance arrived on the scene within minutes. The paramedics spent 45 minutes trying to revive him. I'm sorry.\" I hung up and collapsed on the floor. I was absolutely devastated. He was 14 years old, with so much potential, so much to live for, and he was dead. I broke down, overcome as much by grief as by an overwhelming sense of guilt. \"Tedum is dead,\" I kept repeating, as if trying to convince myself. One minute he had been full of life and now he was dead, at 14, of a heart attack. It just didn't add up. It was impossible. I was desperately trying to gather my thoughts when the phone rang again. It was Mr Wright. \"I just wanted to give you some more details, Ken. I've spoken to your parents in Nigeria and they are on their way. Tedum's body is in the mortuary but we will wait for your father to arrive before we do anything else. I'm sorry, Ken. Good night.\" I grabbed a pack of cigarettes and went for a walk, taking the same route Tedum and I had walked to watch his first football match just three months earlier. I couldn't believe that the strapping, gawky kid who was so looking forward to his first match was now lying in a mortuary. I sat on the pavement on the corner of Fulham Road. All kinds of thoughts were swimming around my mind. Nene ... I felt so desperately sorry for her; I felt impotent, unable to help her once again. She was so far away from the little boy she had pinned so much hope on. My sisters ... Christ, I thought. I hadn't even spoken to them. I rushed back to my flat and dialled a Brighton number. Noo was the first to come to the phone. Then Zina. Neither of them had been told. My father had instructed their teachers not to tell them until he arrived in England. He had wanted to break the news to them himself. The next day, Tedum's death was reported in the papers: \"The son of a wealthy Nigerian businessman died tragically at Eton College yesterday.\" I can't imagine how my sisters would have felt it they had found out from the newspaper. My father was just too far away to understand or appreciate some things. I went home the next day. He had arrived from Nigeria but was alone in the house. \"Where's Nene?\" I barked at him. He told me she was arriving later. I was incensed that they hadn't flown together. He glared at me as if to suggest that it was none of my business. An uneasy silence fell over the house and it didn't break until three days later, when we were heading home from the mortuary after seeing Tedum's body. My father was driving and I was in the passenger seat; my mother and my sisters were in the back. The atmosphere was unbearable: there was grief, resentment and anger in the air. When my father wondered aloud whether the campaign against Shell might not have had something to do with Tedum's death, my sisters and I exploded in unison. We told him to keep his politics out of Tedum's death. Although his concern was at the forefront of our minds as well, we didn't want him to bring it up. \"I'm just trying to protect the rest of you,\" he protested, but we ganged up on him again. He was surprised by the strength of feeling in the ranks. He fell silent, stuffed his pipe in his mouth and started puffing away, popping his lips furiously. Looking back on it, I feel sorry for him. It was as if his children were telling him that he had forfeited his right to be their father. We had willingly given up our father to his political commitment, but we were desperately trying to resist the notion that his politics might invade, jeopardise and compromise our privacy, and even our lives. After the funeral, we went back to Eton to plant a tree near the spot where Tedum had died. We walked back to the car, my father leading the way, his family trailing behind him. He had completely withdrawn from the process by then, and he was conscious that I disapproved. He was probably desperate to go back to Nigeria; in England, he was a stranger in his own house, and he was being made to feel guilty about his shortcomings as the head of his family. In Nigeria, on the other hand, he was being hailed as the father of his people. He could do no wrong there. He looked a mess as he trudged back to the car through the muddy field. He was wearing a long, shabby brown fur coat, the hem of which almost touched the wet grass. As he walked along he suddenly kicked the air in frustration. I don't know why but I just had this feeling that he only did it for my benefit, to show me that he did care. It took me a long time to reconcile myself to the guilt I felt that Tedum had died instead of me. Tests later showed that I had a milder form of the congenital disease that killed him. I had an operation that summer, but I couldn't sleep for months after Tedum died. Nene spooked me when she told me that she had had a vivid dream before she travelled to Nigeria. She dreamt that one of our ancestors came to take me away, but she had pleaded so hard for me that they took Tedum instead. On the night before Tedum's funeral, Zina, Noo and I had sat in his bedroom talking about our little brother. Noo recalled how Tedum had once made my father cry. \"How did he do that?!\" I exclaimed. \"Oh, he just confronted him about Nene, and Jeje broke down.\" I was astonished. My little brother had done what I should have been doing all along, protecting Nene from my father. I was proud of the little man, and embarrassed for myself. The next day, as I scattered earth over Tedum's coffin, I paused and made a silent promise to him. In many, many ways, Tedum's death was the turning point in my life. Trying to make sense of it, I began to look into the ways Africans deal with death, and I came to understand that my little brother was a spirit child. A spirit child is born and reborn many times, moving between the spirit world and the real world. When a spirit child is recalled, he has to go, and thus spirit children often die in childbirth or at a young age. Ben Okri's wonderful evocation of childhood, The Famished Road, tells the story of Azaro Lazarus - a spirit child who refuses to return to the spirit world when his time is up. While I had seen myself as Tedum's substitute father and mentor, I came to appreciate that he had actually been my guiding angel, a spirit child, the son that shone over my father's house. He kept the house warm, comforting my mother until his time was up. Tedum Tambari, the tree of life, the one sent to do God's work, left us just as storm clouds gathered over Ken Saro-Wiwa's house. He came over to London again at Christmas. It was our first Christmas since Tedum's death, and I hoped it would help to get out of the usual routine at my parents' home. My father turned down my invitation, explaining that he would rather fast for our people, that we had no right to enjoy a meal while our people were suffering. I took the snub as it was intended - as a protest against my apolitical stance, but I felt the family needed to come first.The next time I saw him was in the New Year. By then my brother Gian, who had suffered a breakdown in Nigeria two years earlier, had returned to England to get treatment after having a relapse and contracting malaria. Gian was in a terrible state. He was wasted from the malaria, and he was severely agitated by his experiences in Nigeria. Arrangements were made for my father to visit Gian's doctor so they could establish the cause of my brother's relapse. I saw Gian on the day of the scheduled appointment. When I asked his doctor how the meeting with my father had gone, the doctor shook his head. \"He never turned up.\" \"What? What do you mean?\" I snapped. \"He didn't make the appointment. We waited for him, but your father never showed up.\" When I left the hospital, I was determined to give him a piece of my mind. But when I arrived at home, he wasn't there. My mother was in the kitchen, and when I told her what had happened at the hospital she sighed. A few minutes later, he shuffled wearily into the house. His tie was hanging loosely around his neck, the old brown coat looked shabbier than ever, and he was struggling with a pile of documents. He paused in the doorway when he saw me, smiled nervously, and walked into the sitting room. \"Have you been to see Gian?\" I barked at his back, following him into the lounge. He hauled his briefcase onto the dining table, took off his coat and glared at me. I stared him down and he backed off. He sat down and started rifling through the papers on the table. He looked broken, almost pitiful, as he absent-mindedly patted the documents strewn on the table. After a few moments, he glanced up at me plaintively. That look is frozen in my mind. It still haunts me, because I suddenly saw through my father. His hair was matted, there were flecks of grey stubble on his chin, and his eyes looked tired and bloodshot. In that moment, I saw my father for what he was: an old man struggling to meet the incredible personal and political demands on him. My anger began to dissolve. A little voice was urging me to confront him, but another voice insisted I leave him alone. I hovered between anger and guilt for a few seconds. Then, cursing under my breath, I walked away. He was staring at the wreckage of his life scattered across the dining table as I left. It was the last time I ever saw my father. That we parted on such a bad note is one of my greatest regrets. But when I stormed out of the house that afternoon in January 1994, we were poles apart. I didn't understand him; I just couldn't see how he could be leading a struggle that he said was for the future, for us, his children, while he neglected those children's immediate needs and wellbeing. That afternoon, I only understood that his youngest son was dead and another was fighting for his life in hospital, and that all he seemed to care about was his political campaign. I saw a pattern developing, and I didn't want to sacrifice my life for his political conscience. So I turned my back on him. A week later, he went back to Nigeria, leaving the battle on his homefront for another war. It was past midnight when I heard the news. The phone rang at my flat in west London. My mother was on the other end. I knew it was bad news. \"Junior!\" she whispered. \"Tanga le be-e!\" There is trouble at home. My heart sank. I had a numb, sickening feeling that life wouldn't be the same again. Four Ogoni Chiefs - Albert Badey, Tom Orage, Sam Orage and Edward Kobani - were dead, and my father had been arrested in connection with their murders. One of the murdered men, Sam Orage, was my uncle. He was the husband of my aunt Elizabeth, my mother's oldest sister. Images of my cousins Barine, Tom, Desmond and Tuma flashed up in my mind's eye. What kind of sick twist of fate could have brought this on my family, I wondered. I couldn't imagine why or how my father could be implicated in the murder of his friend Edward Kobani, the father of my childhood friends Tombari and Edward. I paced around in a daze, trying to understand the news. But it just didn't make sense. I hadn't been following events in Ogoni, and I had no idea of what had been going on down there. To my apolitical and distanced mind the violence seemed so out of place, out of character, for the Ogoni I knew. It seemed like the kind of senseless butchering that you read about in places like Rwanda. The Ogoni I knew was a docile, peaceful place. The most distressing part of it was that the murders split my family right down the middle. On one side was my father's family and on the other was my mother's. Family ties and loyalties were suddenly stretched. Childhood friends, favourite cousins, would now be separated by a blood feud. As I paced, I tried to figure out what to do. Make the wrong move, say the wrong thing, and it would have far-reaching, emotionally wrenching consequences. In such circumstances all you can do is trust your instincts. I picked up the phone and dialled a number in Los Angeles. My cousin Desmond Orage answered. He could barely speak. \"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry,\" was all I managed to say. There we were, two cousins who had been making plans to meet up in Los Angeles in a few months' time, but now his father had been hacked to death by a mob and my father was alleged to have ordered the killing. \u0095 Read the second part of this article here \u0095 Extracted from The Shadow of a Saint by Ken Wiwa, published by Doubleday on 2nd November priced \u00a316.99.",

If they ever do, Yosuke Imada would be a leading candidate for compiling the rulebook. </p> <p>As the owner of Kyubey, Japan's most prestigious chain of sushi restaurants, Imada has helped set the standard for the country's best-known cuisine with an artist's eye for detail and an engineer's approach to quality control. Everything about him seems to embody sleekness. It is there in his trim appearance - slim with carefully manicured, scrubbed hands and not a hair out of place. It is also there in the minimalist architecture of the company's main restaurant in Tokyo's Ginza district, a dark five-storey building with no windows and the narrowest of entrance ways. And, of course, it is there in the sliced raw fish and mouth-sized beds of rice that he squeezes into shape for his well-heeled customers. </p> <p>It's a buttoned-down style that has worked a treat. Despite charging some of the highest prices in Tokyo amid Japan's worst recession in 10 years, Kyubey is always packed to its pine rafters. Everyone from government leaders to famous actors knows its trademark dishes, such as dancing shrimp (so-called because they are eaten alive) and raw bonito with garlic. </p> <p>Imada stands at the pinnacle of a vast and expanding sushi industry that has permeated every level of Japanese life. Busy salarymen snack on triangles of onigiri and rolls of nutto-maki. Hungry students and train travellers buy sushi boxed lunches from convenience stores and station kiosks. Families entertain with do-it-yourself temaki sushi parties at home. For a little more expertise and atmosphere, people can choose to eat out from about 45,000 sushi restaurants - that converts into at least one for every neighbourhood in the country. Sushi is most definitely not something you make at home - even in its country of origin. </p> <p>In recent years, there has also been an explosion of factory-like \"kaiten\" shops, which cut costs by spinning out sushi to customers who sit around a conveyor belt - a few such enterprises have already made their way to London, and all the signs are that others will follow in increasing numbers, at least in the metropolitan areas. </p> <p>Many purists have criticised this de-personalisation of the sushi experience, but Imada himself views it as a positive development: \"We are at opposite ends of the spectrum,\" he says, \"but I think the kaiten shops are good for business because they are helping to make sushi more popular.\" </p> <p>He has every historical and personal reason to be openminded. Contrary to its reputation as the traditional food of Japan, sushi's roots lie in fairly shallow ground. The origins of the modern dish are usually traced back to 1824, when a Tokyo fish trader named Yohei Hanaya began selling raw cuts of fish from Edo Bay on fingers of sour rice. Edo-mae sushi, as it became known, was an instant hit, but it was considered fast food rather than gourmet dining for the next 100 years. </p> <p>Kyubey had an equally humble beginning as a takeaway, when it was established by Imada's father in 1936. \"Our family lived on the second floor, while dad worked below. He made the sushi kneeling down, and either delivered it or sold it from a street stall. It was tough, but he made a success of it and I was filled with admiration. At the age of eight, I knew I wanted to be a sushi chef like him.\" </p> <p>That meant a 30-month apprenticeship, starting with a lesson in hygiene - repeatedly cleaning the floors and surfaces. \"It was two years before I was allowed to use a knife,\" recalls Imada. He was lucky. Today, the top itamai-san (sushi chefs) train for about 10 years. </p> <p>That is because the job description has changed along with the business. Kyubey is now a multi-million dollar operation with 140 staff, and outlets in five of Tokyo's top hotels. Its chefs still make takeaway sushi, but at the same time they must now also feed, entertain and tot up the charges for every customer at the counter. \"We are all-round personal managers. If you cannot play the part of waiter, sommelier, accountant and conversation partner, then you can't be an itamai-san,\" insists Imada. </p> <p>On top of that, the chefs have to put an astonishing amount of tender loving care into each mouthful of sushi. This means purchasing the freshest and best-quality ingredients from the nearby Tsukiji market every day. With fish now being flown in from all over the world, nothing is ever out of season, but it is crucial to know where and when to buy. Tuna is best in the autumn, when these giants of the seas start to fatten up, while the tastiest Matsudake mushrooms - which cost as much as \u00a330 apiece - are picked from a single hill in Kyoto during a two-week window. </p> <p>Imada goes to considerable lengths to ensure that all his ingredients are kept as fresh as possible, which in many cases means alive. Shrimps and shellfish scuttle around in basement storage ponds right up to the moment that they are ordered and then eaten live. Cuts of tuna, on the other hand, taste better after being left to hang for a few days. The shari (soured rice) must have just the right consistency: too hard and it becomes chewy, too soft and it falls apart as the itamai-san tries to shape it. The wasabi should be freshly ground, fragrant and used sparingly. And then there is the art of choosing the best combination of 25 different kinds of fish - some grilled, some raw - with more subtle seasonings, such as soy sauce, sake, lime, salt, garlic and ginger. Ultimately, explains Imada, you should judge your meal not on the taste of an individual piece of sushi but on the overall mix of flavour, texture, colour and nutrition. </p> <p>Imada is happy to add teacher to the list of roles that an itamai-san must play, especially to foreign diners, whose changing attitude towards sushi is one of the biggest shifts he has noticed in his lifetime. \"For years, sushi was always considered weird and unsafe, because so much of it was raw. Now, though, it seems foreigners are realising that the opposite is true - the standards for sushi are higher because it is impossible to hide bad ingredients.\" </p> <p>The reason for the change, he guesses, is that companies such as Sony and Honda have altered international perceptions about Japanese quality control. \"Thanks to them, I think people started to look at sushi in a new way.\" </p> <p>The reference to manufacturing seems appropriate for a man who selects his words as carefully as his ingredients: \"I am not an artist. If I'm any good at my job, the food will disappear down people's throats almost as soon as it's made. But I must admit that, sometimes, I'll look at a piece of sushi and think that it's so beautifully made that it is a waste to eat it. Maybe there's a bit of the craftsman in me, after all.\" </p> <p><strong> IMADA-SAN'S SUSHI DOS AND DON'TS </strong> </p> <p> <strong> Know your sushi</strong> </p> <p>First, don't make the common mistake of confusing sashimi (cuts of raw fish) with sushi (cooked or raw slices of fish and vegetables that can sit on or snuggle inside a bed of rice). Try to learn the names of the different dishes if you want to impress an itamai-san. And please, says Imada, don't ask for 'maguro' (tuna), which is like going to a steak house and ordering 'cow'. Instead, ask for a particular cut of tuna, such as chu-toro (middle belly). </p> <p><strong> Wasabi</strong> </p> <p>'If you don't like wasabi,' says Imada, 'then you shouldn't be allowed to eat sushi.' But go easy: foreigners, he says, tend to use too much of the spice, wiping out the other more delicate flavours of the sushi. If you do want more of the green stuff, then it is good manners to ask the chef for it while he is making your next dish, rather than splodging it on yourself. If you insist on playing with the horseradish, use your chopsticks to spread a little on to the fish. Never stir wasabi into more than the edge of your soy sauce. </p> <p><strong> Soy sauce</strong> </p> <p>Consider yourself bottom of the class if you end up with even a single grain of rice floating around in your soy sauce. To avoid this, use your fingers or chopsticks (either is perfectly acceptable) to grip the top and bottom of the sushi - rather than the two sides - so that you can turn it upside down. This will allow you stylishly to dip just a corner of the flesh into the sauce. </p> <p><strong> Down in one</strong> </p> <p>'Please don't destroy our masterpieces,' pleads Imada. In other words, as well as avoiding a potentially soggy break-up in the soy sauce, don't try to bite the sushi in half - after all, it has been made for popping into your mouth whole. If it is a little too big, then tell the chef to change the size next time around - a good itamai-san will not need to be asked. </p> <p><strong> Wetting your whistle</strong> </p> <p>In parts of Japan, there's a belief that you should never drink sake while eating sushi because they are both derived from rice. Imada, however, is very liberal when it comes to drink: 'We serve sake, green tea, beer, red wine and even champagne with our sushi. As long as the customer is happy, then who are we to complain?' </p> <p><strong> Order of play</strong> </p> <p>While the first priority in ordering will obviously be to pick your favourites, Imada says a sushi meal must be judged in its entirety, which means choosing a good balance of dishes. In Kyubey, most customers start with the fatty red flesh of toro (from tuna), followed by one or two pieces of white meat, such as sea bream, flounder or turbot. Next, usually comes squid, then a live shrimp or shellfish. Between dishes, you should munch on a slice of ginger - the tangier the better - which serves as a reset button for your tastebuds. To ensure a good nutritional mix, order side dishes of miso soup, daikon and seaweed. </p> <p><strong> THE THREE BASIC CATEGORIES OF SUSHI </strong></p> <p> <strong> Nigiri-zushi (pressed sushi)</strong> </p> <p>Hand pressing shari (rice soured with vinegar) into a slim slab. You can put just about anything on this, though raw, cooked or marinated seafood is most common. Popular toppings are ika (squid), which should be almost translucent and tender; anago (saltwater eel), usually boiled, grilled and brushed with sauce, and toro (the best cut from a tuna), which should be flecked with white fat. </p> <p><strong> Maki-zushi (wrapped sushi)</strong> </p> <p>Thinly spread shari and the filling of your choice on to a sheet of nori (dried seaweed).

      "body": "<p>According to Cassandra Latham, the rules of spell-casting are: don't dabble but do persist; do not start anything that you can't finish; be aware that anything you wish for in another person may come back to you; and be precise. 'Don't just ask for money, because your nearest and dearest might drop down dead, leaving you an inheritance.'</p> <p><b> Candle magic</b></p> <p>'A good general-purpose spell that anyone who believes in it can do,' says Latham. Pick a candle of an appropriate colour for the job (green or pink for love, yellow for wealth, red for strength, blue for good fortune, mauve for wisdom, brown for stability). If you wish to draw something towards yourself, write its name from the top of the candle to the bottom. If it's something you want to dispel, write it from the bottom to the top. Candle magic, like most magic, is best done after dark. To draw something to you, begin the spell on a new moon; to dispel it, begin on a waning moon. Light the candle and strongly visualise what you want to achieve for as long as you can maintain concentration. Blow out the candle. Repeat the procedure the next night, and again each night until the moon has completed its waxing or waning. Bury or burn the candle debris. Don't throw it away. Don't talk about the spell; and, once it's done, forget about it.</p> <p><b> Witches' ladder</b></p> <p>Dedicate a piece of rope to magic. Following the same lunar pattern as for candle magic, each night tie one knot in the rope while strongly visualising what you wish to achieve. Tie the knots towards you to draw your object inward and away from you to dispel it. Witches' ladders have a long tradition in Cornwall, where they were commonly sold to fishermen before a trip out to sea. Untying the first knot would unleash a light breeze, the second a stronger wind and so on. A witches' ladder also refers to a string of 40 beads used like a rosary as an aid to concentrated repetition.</p> <p><b> Witches' poppets</b></p> <p>Poppets are wax, clay or even Plasticene figures resembling the person on whom the magic is to be focused. In a coven, the poppet may be consecrated on a witches' altar, attached by cord to both a woman and a man (according to the Wiccan belief, that male and female energy combined create the most effective magic), and given the appropriate symbolic treatment. The poppet's leg might be bandaged as part of a healing ritual, or its mouth might be sewn up to prevent the living person it represents from spreading gossip. Once the spell has worked, the poppet will be burned or buried, thereby releasing the spell.</p> <p>When I was a little girl, I thought I was a witch. Borrowing my mum's old milkpan, I would pass balmy summer evenings stirring livid stews of wild berries and gladioli over a bonfire at the back of our garden, then pour the resulting brew into jam jars and label them \"potion\". I communicated with other (invisible) witches in witch language scrawled over my cupboard door. I made up witch songs and caterwauled them out of the window at night. I began demanding to be persecuted. My particular hankering was to be tossed into a chasm, though these are not at all common around Basildon. To my mother and father's credit, they resisted what must by then have been the almost irresistible, and I lived on. Not content with my good luck, I acquired a black cat. Finally, and to my eternal regret, I fed my hamster to a toad.</p> <p>Some time soon after, I discovered Fuzzy Felt, or perhaps it was Pippa dolls, and forgot all about witchcraft. Until a couple of years ago, that is, when The Old Religion, as witches often call it, suddenly emerged from the broom closet and into the light. The Craft and The Blair Witch Project appeared on film, The Witches Of Eastwick went into production as a musical. The first of the Harry Potter books was published and sold in its millions. Sabrina The Teenage Witch and Buffy The Vampire Slayer began airing on British TV. All over Britain (and America and beyond), Hecate was getting hip. Something curious was happening.</p> <p>It got curiouser and curiouser. During my research for this article, I found a tarantula on my doorstep. Sometime later, a live crow in a knotted dustbin bag appeared (and flew to its freedom the moment I opened the bag). Now, crows and tarantulas don't wash up on my doorstep every day, but life is plump with coincidence, weirdness happens, and though intrigued and slightly ruffled I carried on all the same.</p> <p>According to the Pagan Federation, there are currently 10,000 initiated witches in this country and more than 100,000 pagans. Compare this with 6,000 practising British Druids and 4,000 Buddhists, and you'll get the point. What was once taboo is now almost de rigueur. The witch religion, Wicca (wicce is the Anglo-Saxon word for witch), though only founded within the past 50 years, is growing fast. And we're exporting it. In the past couple of years, Wicca has really taken off on the continent and in the English-speaking world, most particularly in the US and Australia. No one knows how many Wiccans or witches there are worldwide, but a million would probably cover it. And it all began here in Britain.</p> <p>Some definitions are called for. Wicca is a subset of paganism, as well as being the witch religion, and while all Wiccans are witches (even the men), not all witches are Wiccans. Some witches are agnostics, or Christians, or Hindus, or just plain old witches. The latter are often known as hedge witches. They tend to work alone and often describe themselves as being in The Craft. Most Wiccans, by contrast, work in covens. It goes without saying that not all pagans are witches, nor, necessarily, are all witches pagans. Wizards and warlocks, by the way, are neither witches nor Wiccans, but people (usually men) who practise high magic (more of which later) with no overtly religious context. So far as we know, there aren't many of them.</p> <p>To make it all crystal clear, let's just say that The Witches Of Eastwick are Wiccans, Sabrina is a hedge witch and, if Harry Potter is anything, then he is probably a wizard. Paganism and witchcraft have been a thriving part of British culture for as long as there are records. In the 11th century, King Canute was sufficiently threatened by them to issue anti-pagan and anti-witchcraft laws, and witchcraft was still illegal in this country until 1951. But The Craft was relatively tolerated in England. Elizabeth I had her own court witch in the form of John Dee, the royal alchemist, and even during the great witch-hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, witches were rarely burned alive in England, as they were in continental Europe and Scotland. They were hanged or strangled, then burned.</p> <p>Having lain low for a century or so after those particular horrors, British witches began to re-emerge in the 18th century, in the guise of cunning men and wise women, local oddballs who lived on the outskirts of villages and ministered to broken hearts and neighbourhood grievances.</p> <p>Cassandra Latham still does. Britain's only professional witch (her tax return states her occupation as \"village witch\"), Latham whips up charms and spells for the locals of St Buryan, near Land's End, and, via her website, for anyone else prepared to stump up a modest fee or offer a skill to trade. Latham even looks the part - a tiny, impish thing with sky-blue eyes and witchy, black hair, chopped, rather charmingly, mullet-style. A qualified nurse and counsellor, Latham turned to witching 16 years ago, after a back injury put paid to her nursing career, but she always knew she was different: \"I didn't have a wonderful childhood and I retreated into otherworldliness. Part of the work I do now involves walking between this world and the spirit world, and I did that, too, when I was a child. It used to be an escape route, now it's a choice.\"</p> <p>Glaswegian pensioner Mary Rands inherited her interest in witchcraft from her grandmother, who was considered \"fey\". Rands' sister is also a witch. \"I chose witchcraft, but witchcraft also chose me,\" she says. Most witches have no family connections to The Craft, but feel drawn nonetheless. Maureen Brown is a qualified Jungian psychotherapist, who has been a member of a coven in Croydon for the past 26 years. \"As a child, I was considered strange because I saw things with lights around them, which I now know to be auras. I was always different. I was always a seeker.\" In her early 20s, Brown was introduced to two witches at a party and never looked back. \"By that time, I had experimented with many of the major religions, but I just knew that witchcraft was for me.\"</p> <p>Caroline Robertson, proprietor of Westbury Music, the UK's leading independent dance-music label, was initiated into Wicca four years ago, but her interest in witchcraft began in childhood. \"I was always a daydreamer. I believed in the force and power of nature and in the mystery of life.\" She bought her first pack of tarot cards at university. \"It was 1970, Lennon and McCartney were doing their thing and everyone was getting a bit mystical.\" According to Robertson, you don't have to be born a witch, but it takes a certain kind of person to become one. \"A businessman's mind would be wasted in a coven. Witchcraft is about threshold worlds and shifting realities. It appeals to odd people, loners, folk who don't follow the normal rules.\"</p> <p>Cassandra Latham doesn't follow \"the normal rules\", but her clients - she sees about 200 a year - tend to be regular Joes and Joannas with all the usual problems. \"The reasons people used to go to cunning folk in the past are the same as the reasons people come to me now. Relationships, jobs, money, health. People often ask me to cleanse their homes of psychic debris. One of the most common things I get asked to do is to remove curses, but no one ever asks me for anything ridiculous. It's pastoral work, just like the vicar, really.\"</p> <p>Well, not quite like the vicar (though Latham says she gets on well with him). \"What makes me different from a psychotherapist or any other counsellor is that I use magic. I believe that old habit patterns lie in the unconscious. If you want to change them, you need to communicate to the unconscious in a way it'll respond to - with symbols and archetypes and ritual. If you perform a spell with particular motifs, it will clear the unconscious ground. I find it very effective and very quick. You could spend years in psychotherapy getting to that point, whereas magic will take the shortest route, and in it goes.\"</p> <p>Ah yes, magic. It's nonsense, obviously. Well, perhaps not complete nonsense. But definitely something for the funny folk. Except, except ... we all do it. Every time we step over cracks in the pavement, don our lucky ties for the job interview, spit on the dice before we throw, we have fallen under magic's spell. Vivianne Crowley, senior lecturer in the psychology of religion at London University, puts it like this: \"Magical thinking gives us a sense of control in a world of random events. It gives you a sense that the universe is listening to you and speaking to you. Psychologically, that can be a very useful strategy.\" Children employ magical thinking every day and the world religions all have some magical element. What else are biblical miracles or the mysticism of the Jewish cabbala? However much we may pooh-pooh magic, we seem to be saturated in it all the same. \"Magic connects with people on some ancient level,\" says Latham. \"It's like a race memory almost. It hits the primitive part of our minds.\"</p> <p>Crowley agrees: \"Most witches believe that magic is innate in the human psyche. It's something lots of people can develop.\" She's not talking about sawing ladies in half or card tricks. She's talking about actual, transformative magic.</p> <p>But what is magic? Well, no one really knows, but received wisdom defines it as the use of the will to effect change, and recognises two types: natural and high, or ritualistic. In natural magic, witches emphasise folk wisdom. They may cast spells and use candles, herbs, wax images, crystals and scrying or divination objects such as crystal balls and dowsing rods, as well as more familiar psychological techniques such as meditation, visualisation and repetition to focus their minds on the effects they want to manifest. Natural magic is craftwork, and its practitioners regard themselves as craftsmen and women. They are in The Craft.</p> <p>High or ritualistic magic tends to focus more on ceremony, ritual and invocation. Alchemists were generally high magicians, but high magic's most famous son is probably the turn-of-the-century mystic and occultist Aleister Crowley. Most ritualistic magic is conducted in groups or covens. Witchcraft's own religion, Wicca, makes much use of it. \"The difference,\" says Latham, \"is that high magic is formal and theatrical.\"</p> <p>Does magic work? Graham King thinks so. Four years ago, King sold his successful business making specialist cameras for archive libraries, got rid of the Jag and the country cottage, burned his collection of silk ties and bought the Museum Of Witchcraft, Boscastle, on the north coast of Cornwall, which he now runs as a going concern. Fifty thousand visitors come to the museum every year to peer at the cases of charms, amulets, poppets (wax dolls), wands, athames (ceremonial knives), scourges (ceremonial whips) and talismans. Having spent 20years as a scientist, technician and businessman, King now devotes his life to witchery. \"I'm a scientist, but I believe in magic because I've seen it work,\" he says. \"I don't know why it works, but I accept it does. Look, I have been employed in the electronics industry, and I don't know how electricity really works, either, but it does, right?\" He has a point. Hands up who really understands how the telly makes pictures, or the microwave makes dinners. As for the VCR . . .</p> <p>Debate as to whether magic is a psychological or supernatural power, or a bit of both, boils like a brothy cauldron in the witching community. Vivianne Crowley (no relation to Aleister, incidentally) is in no doubt. \"The power of magic is 90% psychological and 10% anomalous events not beyond scientific understanding but beyond current scientific understanding. Even the British Psychological Society has become interested in the ability of spiritual practices to manifest healing powers, and in clairvoyance, psychometry [the ability to divine by touching something] and telepathy, those techniques psychologists call parapsychology.\" She points out that there is now a chair of parapsychology at Edinburgh University, it's that respectable.</p> <p>According to Crowley, Wiccans simply harness and develop these parapsychological techniques. Which is both disappointing (no fabulous supernatural phenomena) and intriguing (anyone can do it). \"Could I turn a lightbulb into a frog?\" asks Maureen Brown. \"Yes, but it would take a very long time, and all my energy, and it's easier to work for the money and then go and buy a frog.\" Caroline Robertson agrees: \"I could probably change plastic to gold, but it would take years.\" Crowley is sceptical. When I told her that some witches claimed to be able to turn lightbulbs into frogs, she just laughed and said, \"Rubbish!\"</p> <p>The obvious question remains. If magic is as powerful as some witches claim it to be, why can't witches put a stop to famine/war/ disease? And why isn't every witch a millionaire? Or immortal? Ah, well. For one thing, witches are human, as fallible as doctors or politicians (and we all know how fallible they are). Most witches just aren't all that competent, and the ones who are tend not to mouth off about it. Not so long ago, a very public attempt by the self-proclaimed king of the witches, Kevin Carlyon, to prevent the building of the Channel Tunnel by burning an effigy of a train raised a good few nudge-nudge, wink-winks in the pubs around Lewes, East Sussex, Carlyon's home town, and knocked something of a dent in the reputation of The Craft. These days, most witches have learned to be more modest about their powers. \"I'm not Superwitch. I would say that I have a 70% success rate,\" says Latham, \"but I can't think of any business which is 100% all the time.\"</p> <p>Then there's the responsibility. \"If people think I'm going to wave a magic wand and whisk their problems away, they have to think again,\" says Latham. \"I can help you to help yourself is all. If I waved a wand, I'd just be disempowering you.\" If that sounds a bit like self-help waffle, witches insist they get results. King recently cast spells for a couple who were finding it hard to conceive, and \"baby Sean arrived nine months later\". On the other hand, \"I only get involved with things where there's real need. Someone who just wants a new boyfriend can sort themselves out.\"</p> <p>What about black magic? Officially, Wicca operates a no-harm principle, the so-called Wiccan Rede, but King claims that \"the principle is recent and not many witches stick to it\". King himself admits to having cast spells with \"broken mirrors and effigies and coffins to warn people to behave well. The circumstances haven't yet arisen where I might actually curse someone, but that's not to say there are no such circumstances.\"</p> <p>Rands isn't so circumspect. In the 30-odd years she's been a witch (and a civil servant, qualified nurse, nanny), she's found herself in the hexing business twice. \"Oh, I've stamped my foot and pointed my finger all right. I'm old-fashioned in that way. An eye for an eye. I cursed one man who was forcing his sexual attentions on women and he's now got a very nasty incurable skin disease. That might not have been my doing, of course, it might have happened anyway. But...\"</p> <p>That said, most witches hesitate to use black magic because they believe in the threefold boomerang - that their actions will return to them three times over. Since sending her victim a skin disease, Rands' own health has taken a downturn. \"If that's because I've ill-wished someone, then I have to take responsibility.\" Then she chuckles. \"But it was worth it.\"</p> <p>Cursing and hexing are partly what gives witchcraft a bad name, of course. But even if black magic were effective, in the context of the damage done in the name of the world religions, a little skin disease among rou\u00e9s doesn't seem so bad. All the same, there's a reluctance among many witches to talk freely. You can hardly blame them for having a persecution complex. Somewhere in the region of 40,000, mostly women, were murdered in Britain during the great witch-hunts, for an assortment of evils ranging from spinsterhood and warts to ergot poisoning. (Ergot is a fungus that infects rye, causing convulsions and hallucinations in anyone who eats it. There is now plenty of evidence to suggest that the symptoms of the \"possessions\" at Salem and elsewhere - in the UK in East Anglia especially - during the witch-hunt period were the result of ergot poisoning.)</p> <p>Even now, in our secular age, we can't quite make up our minds about The Craft. Though the Witchcraft Act was repealed in 1951, we're still edgy about witching. Lest we forget, it was only 15 years ago that we had our own Salem, with the tabloids screaming blue murder over supposed acts of satanic abuse by witches and Devil worshippers. Even though a 1994 government enquiry into the whole affair found that ritual abuse \"has never been substantiated by empirical evidence\", the public remains willing to lump witchcraft in with Satanism, as though the two were some devilish double act. (For the record, witches do not believe in the existence of Satan, so it would be a little eccentric of them to worship him/her/it.)</p> <p>Earlier this year, evidence of ritual activity was discovered on the hills overlooking the Meon Valley, near Southampton. Wax had been dripped on to the ground from candles and, buried in a circle, investigators uncovered 12 dead rats. Meon Valley police immediately contacted Graham King at the Museum Of Witchcraft for advice. Inspector Shaun Moore of Meon Valley police says: \"We are concerned it might lead to something.\" The headline in the Southern Daily Echo (and it was a big one) read, \"Occult Probe\". Shock and horror! Wax drips and dead rats.</p> <p>Unfortunately, discrimination against Wiccans and pagans is alive and well, tinged with ignorance and paranoia. Drama teacher Ralph Morse was recently suspended from his job at Shenfield high school in Essex after admitting to being youth officer for the Pagan Federation and a practising witch (he was later reinstated). The school's headteacher, John Fairhurst, issued a statement saying, \"We completely and unequivocally reject their world of witchcraft and magic.\" Rands was asked to leave her post as a nanny after her journalist employer accused her of using witchcraft to \"steal the children\".</p> <p>In the US, things are even worse. Despite a constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and religion, Harry Potter (our own dear HP!) is banned in schools in Kansas and Colorado for promoting witchcraft. (The rows of chain stores and discount outlets piled high with pointy Hallowe'en hats and broomsticks are okay, though. That's just business.)</p> <p>Thankfully, witches appear not to have returned the religious bigotry. Having made the journey from Catholic to witch, Rands insists, \"there's not much distance between them. They share the same sense of ritual.\" Graham King goes further: \"I would have no trouble invoking Christ. I would visualise him and ask for his assistance. I don't think he's the son of God, but he's a pretty good witch.\"</p> <p>The next decade could see Wicca completely throw off its associations with the occult (\"occult\" means hidden) and go mainstream. Which would no doubt please its founder, Gerald Gardner (1883-1964). Claiming to have been initiated in the \"Old Ways\" by a crone named Dorothy Clutterbuck in the New Forest in 1939, Gardner published Witchcraft Today soon after the repeal of the Witchcraft Act in 1951 and effectively founded what has become Wicca, the witches' religion. In Witchcraft Today, Gardner laid out the eight sabbats, or Wiccan festivals, an amalgam of the old pagan solstices and equinoxes and the Celtic nature festivals of Imbolc (Candlemas), Beltane (May Day), Lammas (beginning of August) and Samhain (All Hallow's Eve).</p> <p>A mildly eccentric ex-colonial civil servant whose influences ranged from Hinduism to folk magic to freemasonry, Gardner conceived of a celebratory religion whose focus was on the power of the natural world. Wiccan rituals generally begin with the drawing of a magic circle, offerings to the elements and the four directions, and continue with a series of rituals, incantations and chants whose power rests in the symbolic marriage of male and female. But does that amount to a religion? Vivianne Crowley says it does: \"A religion is a set of ritual acts and practices invoking or calling up the divine. By that definition, Wicca is undoubtedly a religion.\"</p> <p>One problem with Gardner's work, however, was that, in order to give Wicca the authority he felt it deserved, he couched its rituals and incantations in purple prose, stuffing in grandiose archaisms wherever he could fit them, so that, to the unconvinced, Wicca can seem rather absurd, all thees and thous and thereforeuntos. Even the Wiccan salutation - Blessed Be - is tinged with hey-nonny-no.</p> <p>Another problem is that Gardner appears to have been a bit of a perv. It was he who introduced into Wiccan ritual scourging, the practice of using flails or whips lightly to scourge the skin as an aid to concentration. This idea was not new - some Hindu and Christian sects still practise it - but there was no evidence that it had ever been part of witchcraft traditions. And his ideas about working \"skyclad\" or naked also raised some eyebrows. \"Yes, Gardner probably was a dirty old man and virtually illiterate and, no, there is no evidence for scourges elsewhere in any witchcraft literature,\" admits Graham King.</p> <p>Neither of these things appears to have put Wiccans off. \"Wicca is a surprisingly modern religion that draws on some ancient ideas,\" insists Crowley. \"Wicca venerates nature, and is associated with vegetarianism and animal rights. Its feminism and emphasis on individual responsibility matches people's perception of the world.\"</p> <p>But, I say, nudity, magic, the mysteries of nature, it's all a bit un-British, isn't it? On the contrary, says Ronald Hutton, professor of history at Bristol University. \"Wicca is very British - English, actually. We are the first nation to have industrialised and to have been acutely cut off from the natural world. Wicca is a response to that, a countercultural religion allowing people to link back with the land.\"</p> <p>A product of our history it may be, but does Wicca have a future? Since its inception 50 years ago, it has branched off and taken on local flavours. There are now radical feminist, gay and all-male Wiccan groups. \"Wicca is going through radical changes at the moment because of its growth,\" says Crowley. \"There's a much wider range of people now, and a lot of those getting involved are not seeking the occult but a modern spiritual practice. They're attracted to participatory ritual, and there's a hunger for a spiritual system that enhances lives by bringing about an inner change. And Wicca is celebratory.\"</p> <p>Wiccans themselves are optimistic. As Crowley says, \"Wicca has no paid leadership, no buildings, no capital: it's like a huge voluntary group, but it's survived 50 years.\" Professor Hutton, himself a druid, agrees: \"The fact that Wicca is a mystery religion and includes nudity and initiation rites means it will always shock the mainstream, but I think it will persist. Wicca is having a strong influence on rave and rock culture, eco-pagans and road protesters. The correspondence between magic and virtual reality means it also appeals to infotech workers. It's a religion for self-employed and self-reliant people, artisans and individualists, and it is currently finding its role as the clergy or inner ring to these groups. The 90s saw a remarkable pulling together of all the pagan strands.\"</p> <p>No one I spoke to had any ideas about the tarantula and the crow, by the way. The woman in my local pet shop wasn't missing a tarantula, though she pointed out that they are great escape artists. So I've decided the tarantula was a runaway pet. But as for the crow, well, I really don't know what to think about the crow</p>",

'Don't just ask for money, because your nearest and dearest might drop down dead, leaving you an inheritance.' Candle magic 'A good general-purpose spell that anyone who believes in it can do,' says Latham. Pick a candle of an appropriate colour for the job (green or pink for love, yellow for wealth, red for strength, blue for good fortune, mauve for wisdom, brown for stability). If you wish to draw something towards yourself, write its name from the top of the candle to the bottom. If it's something you want to dispel, write it from the bottom to the top. Candle magic, like most magic, is best done after dark. To draw something to you, begin the spell on a new moon; to dispel it, begin on a waning moon. Light the candle and strongly visualise what you want to achieve for as long as you can maintain concentration. Blow out the candle. Repeat the procedure the next night, and again each night until the moon has completed its waxing or waning. Bury or burn the candle debris. Don't throw it away. Don't talk about the spell; and, once it's done, forget about it. Witches' ladder Dedicate a piece of rope to magic. Following the same lunar pattern as for candle magic, each night tie one knot in the rope while strongly visualising what you wish to achieve. Tie the knots towards you to draw your object inward and away from you to dispel it. Witches' ladders have a long tradition in Cornwall, where they were commonly sold to fishermen before a trip out to sea. Untying the first knot would unleash a light breeze, the second a stronger wind and so on. A witches' ladder also refers to a string of 40 beads used like a rosary as an aid to concentrated repetition. Witches' poppets Poppets are wax, clay or even Plasticene figures resembling the person on whom the magic is to be focused. In a coven, the poppet may be consecrated on a witches' altar, attached by cord to both a woman and a man (according to the Wiccan belief, that male and female energy combined create the most effective magic), and given the appropriate symbolic treatment. The poppet's leg might be bandaged as part of a healing ritual, or its mouth might be sewn up to prevent the living person it represents from spreading gossip. Once the spell has worked, the poppet will be burned or buried, thereby releasing the spell. When I was a little girl, I thought I was a witch. Borrowing my mum's old milkpan, I would pass balmy summer evenings stirring livid stews of wild berries and gladioli over a bonfire at the back of our garden, then pour the resulting brew into jam jars and label them \"potion\". I communicated with other (invisible) witches in witch language scrawled over my cupboard door. I made up witch songs and caterwauled them out of the window at night. I began demanding to be persecuted. My particular hankering was to be tossed into a chasm, though these are not at all common around Basildon. To my mother and father's credit, they resisted what must by then have been the almost irresistible, and I lived on. Not content with my good luck, I acquired a black cat.

According to the Pagan Federation, there are currently 10,000 initiated witches in this country and more than 100,000 pagans. Compare this with 6,000 practising British Druids and 4,000 Buddhists, and you'll get the point. What was once taboo is now almost de rigueur. The witch religion, Wicca (wicce is the Anglo-Saxon word for witch), though only founded within the past 50 years, is growing fast. And we're exporting it.

So far as we know, there aren't many of them. To make it all crystal clear, let's just say that The Witches Of Eastwick are Wiccans, Sabrina is a hedge witch and, if Harry Potter is anything, then he is probably a wizard.

Cassandra Latham still does.

I was always a seeker.\" In her early 20s, Brown was introduced to two witches at a party and never looked back. \"By that time, I had experimented with many of the major religions, but I just knew that witchcraft was for me.\" Caroline Robertson, proprietor of Westbury Music, the UK's leading independent dance-music label, was initiated into Wicca four years ago, but her interest in witchcraft began in childhood. \"I was always a daydreamer. I believed in the force and power of nature and in the mystery of life.\" She bought her first pack of tarot cards at university. \"It was 1970, Lennon and McCartney were doing their thing and everyone was getting a bit mystical.\" According to Robertson, you don't have to be born a witch, but it takes a certain kind of person to become one. \"A businessman's mind would be wasted in a coven. Witchcraft is about threshold worlds and shifting realities. It appeals to odd people, loners, folk who don't follow the normal rules.\" Cassandra Latham doesn't follow \"the normal rules\", but her clients - she sees about 200 a year - tend to be regular Joes and Joannas with all the usual problems. \"The reasons people used to go to cunning folk in the past are the same as the reasons people come to me now. Relationships, jobs, money, health. People often ask me to cleanse their homes of psychic debris. One of the most common things I get asked to do is to remove curses, but no one ever asks me for anything ridiculous. It's pastoral work, just like the vicar, really.\" Well, not quite like the vicar (though Latham says she gets on well with him). \"What makes me different from a psychotherapist or any other counsellor is that I use magic. I believe that old habit patterns lie in the unconscious. If you want to change them, you need to communicate to the unconscious in a way it'll respond to - with symbols and archetypes and ritual. If you perform a spell with particular motifs, it will clear the unconscious ground. I find it very effective and very quick. You could spend years in psychotherapy getting to that point, whereas magic will take the shortest route, and in it goes.\" Ah yes, magic. It's nonsense, obviously. Well, perhaps not complete nonsense. But definitely something for the funny folk. Except, except ... we all do it. Every time we step over cracks in the pavement, don our lucky ties for the job interview, spit on the dice before we throw, we have fallen under magic's spell. Vivianne Crowley, senior lecturer in the psychology of religion at London University, puts it like this: \"Magical thinking gives us a sense of control in a world of random events. It gives you a sense that the universe is listening to you and speaking to you. Psychologically, that can be a very useful strategy.\" Children employ magical thinking every day and the world religions all have some magical element. What else are biblical miracles or the mysticism of the Jewish cabbala? However much we may pooh-pooh magic, we seem to be saturated in it all the same. \"Magic connects with people on some ancient level,\" says Latham. \"It's like a race memory almost. It hits the primitive part of our minds.\" Crowley agrees: \"Most witches believe that magic is innate in the human psyche. It's something lots of people can develop.\" She's not talking about sawing ladies in half or card tricks. She's talking about actual, transformative magic. But what is magic? Well, no one really knows, but received wisdom defines it as the use of the will to effect change, and recognises two types: natural and high, or ritualistic. In natural magic, witches emphasise folk wisdom. They may cast spells and use candles, herbs, wax images, crystals and scrying or divination objects such as crystal balls and dowsing rods, as well as more familiar psychological techniques such as meditation, visualisation and repetition to focus their minds on the effects they want to manifest. Natural magic is craftwork, and its practitioners regard themselves as craftsmen and women. They are in The Craft. High or ritualistic magic tends to focus more on ceremony, ritual and invocation. Alchemists were generally high magicians, but high magic's most famous son is probably the turn-of-the-century mystic and occultist Aleister Crowley. Most ritualistic magic is conducted in groups or covens. Witchcraft's own religion, Wicca, makes much use of it. \"The difference,\" says Latham, \"is that high magic is formal and theatrical.\" Does magic work? Graham King thinks so. Four years ago, King sold his successful business making specialist cameras for archive libraries, got rid of the Jag and the country cottage, burned his collection of silk ties and bought the Museum Of Witchcraft, Boscastle, on the north coast of Cornwall, which he now runs as a going concern. Fifty thousand visitors come to the museum every year to peer at the cases of charms, amulets, poppets (wax dolls), wands, athames (ceremonial knives), scourges (ceremonial whips) and talismans. Having spent 20years as a scientist, technician and businessman, King now devotes his life to witchery. \"I'm a scientist, but I believe in magic because I've seen it work,\" he says. \"I don't know why it works, but I accept it does. Look, I have been employed in the electronics industry, and I don't know how electricity really works, either, but it does, right?\" He has a point. Hands up who really understands how the telly makes pictures, or the microwave makes dinners. As for the VCR . . . Debate as to whether magic is a psychological or supernatural power, or a bit of both, boils like a brothy cauldron in the witching community. Vivianne Crowley (no relation to Aleister, incidentally) is in no doubt. \"The power of magic is 90% psychological and 10% anomalous events not beyond scientific understanding but beyond current scientific understanding. Even the British Psychological Society has become interested in the ability of spiritual practices to manifest healing powers, and in clairvoyance, psychometry [the ability to divine by touching something] and telepathy, those techniques psychologists call parapsychology.\" She points out that there is now a chair of parapsychology at Edinburgh University, it's that respectable. According to Crowley, Wiccans simply harness and develop these parapsychological techniques. Which is both disappointing (no fabulous supernatural phenomena) and intriguing (anyone can do it). \"Could I turn a lightbulb into a frog?\" asks Maureen Brown. \"Yes, but it would take a very long time, and all my energy, and it's easier to work for the money and then go and buy a frog.\" Caroline Robertson agrees: \"I could probably change plastic to gold, but it would take years.\" Crowley is sceptical. When I told her that some witches claimed to be able to turn lightbulbs into frogs, she just laughed and said, \"Rubbish!\" The obvious question remains. If magic is as powerful as some witches claim it to be, why can't witches put a stop to famine/war/ disease? And why isn't every witch a millionaire? Or immortal? Ah, well. For one thing, witches are human, as fallible as doctors or politicians (and we all know how fallible they are). Most witches just aren't all that competent, and the ones who are tend not to mouth off about it. Not so long ago, a very public attempt by the self-proclaimed king of the witches, Kevin Carlyon, to prevent the building of the Channel Tunnel by burning an effigy of a train raised a good few nudge-nudge, wink-winks in the pubs around Lewes, East Sussex, Carlyon's home town, and knocked something of a dent in the reputation of The Craft. These days, most witches have learned to be more modest about their powers. \"I'm not Superwitch. I would say that I have a 70% success rate,\" says Latham, \"but I can't think of any business which is 100% all the time.\" Then there's the responsibility. \"If people think I'm going to wave a magic wand and whisk their problems away, they have to think again,\" says Latham. \"I can help you to help yourself is all. If I waved a wand, I'd just be disempowering you.\" If that sounds a bit like self-help waffle, witches insist they get results. King recently cast spells for a couple who were finding it hard to conceive, and \"baby Sean arrived nine months later\". On the other hand, \"I only get involved with things where there's real need. Someone who just wants a new boyfriend can sort themselves out.\" What about black magic? Officially, Wicca operates a no-harm principle, the so-called Wiccan Rede, but King claims that \"the principle is recent and not many witches stick to it\". King himself admits to having cast spells with \"broken mirrors and effigies and coffins to warn people to behave well. The circumstances haven't yet arisen where I might actually curse someone, but that's not to say there are no such circumstances.\" Rands isn't so circumspect. In the 30-odd years she's been a witch (and a civil servant, qualified nurse, nanny), she's found herself in the hexing business twice. \"Oh, I've stamped my foot and pointed my finger all right. I'm old-fashioned in that way. An eye for an eye. I cursed one man who was forcing his sexual attentions on women and he's now got a very nasty incurable skin disease. That might not have been my doing, of course, it might have happened anyway. But...\" That said, most witches hesitate to use black magic because they believe in the threefold boomerang - that their actions will return to them three times over. Since sending her victim a skin disease, Rands' own health has taken a downturn. \"If that's because I've ill-wished someone, then I have to take responsibility.\" Then she chuckles. \"But it was worth it.\" Cursing and hexing are partly what gives witchcraft a bad name, of course. But even if black magic were effective, in the context of the damage done in the name of the world religions, a little skin disease among rou\u00e9s doesn't seem so bad. All the same, there's a reluctance among many witches to talk freely. You can hardly blame them for having a persecution complex. Somewhere in the region of 40,000, mostly women, were murdered in Britain during the great witch-hunts, for an assortment of evils ranging from spinsterhood and warts to ergot poisoning. (Ergot is a fungus that infects rye, causing convulsions and hallucinations in anyone who eats it. There is now plenty of evidence to suggest that the symptoms of the \"possessions\" at Salem and elsewhere - in the UK in East Anglia especially - during the witch-hunt period were the result of ergot poisoning.) Even now, in our secular age, we can't quite make up our minds about The Craft. Though the Witchcraft Act was repealed in 1951, we're still edgy about witching. Lest we forget, it was only 15 years ago that we had our own Salem, with the tabloids screaming blue murder over supposed acts of satanic abuse by witches and Devil worshippers. Even though a 1994 government enquiry into the whole affair found that ritual abuse \"has never been substantiated by empirical evidence\", the public remains willing to lump witchcraft in with Satanism, as though the two were some devilish double act. (For the record, witches do not believe in the existence of Satan, so it would be a little eccentric of them to worship him/her/it.) Earlier this year, evidence of ritual activity was discovered on the hills overlooking the Meon Valley, near Southampton. Wax had been dripped on to the ground from candles and, buried in a circle, investigators uncovered 12 dead rats. Meon Valley police immediately contacted Graham King at the Museum Of Witchcraft for advice. Inspector Shaun Moore of Meon Valley police says: \"We are concerned it might lead to something.\" The headline in the Southern Daily Echo (and it was a big one) read, \"Occult Probe\". Shock and horror! Wax drips and dead rats. Unfortunately, discrimination against Wiccans and pagans is alive and well, tinged with ignorance and paranoia. Drama teacher Ralph Morse was recently suspended from his job at Shenfield high school in Essex after admitting to being youth officer for the Pagan Federation and a practising witch (he was later reinstated). The school's headteacher, John Fairhurst, issued a statement saying, \"We completely and unequivocally reject their world of witchcraft and magic.\" Rands was asked to leave her post as a nanny after her journalist employer accused her of using witchcraft to \"steal the children\". In the US, things are even worse. Despite a constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech and religion, Harry Potter (our own dear HP!) is banned in schools in Kansas and Colorado for promoting witchcraft. (The rows of chain stores and discount outlets piled high with pointy Hallowe'en hats and broomsticks are okay, though. That's just business.) Thankfully, witches appear not to have returned the religious bigotry. Having made the journey from Catholic to witch, Rands insists, \"there's not much distance between them. They share the same sense of ritual.\" Graham King goes further: \"I would have no trouble invoking Christ. I would visualise him and ask for his assistance. I don't think he's the son of God, but he's a pretty good witch.\" The next decade could see Wicca completely throw off its associations with the occult (\"occult\" means hidden) and go mainstream. Which would no doubt please its founder, Gerald Gardner (1883-1964). Claiming to have been initiated in the \"Old Ways\" by a crone named Dorothy Clutterbuck in the New Forest in 1939, Gardner published Witchcraft Today soon after the repeal of the Witchcraft Act in 1951 and effectively founded what has become Wicca, the witches' religion. In Witchcraft Today, Gardner laid out the eight sabbats, or Wiccan festivals, an amalgam of the old pagan solstices and equinoxes and the Celtic nature festivals of Imbolc (Candlemas), Beltane (May Day), Lammas (beginning of August) and Samhain (All Hallow's Eve). A mildly eccentric ex-colonial civil servant whose influences ranged from Hinduism to folk magic to freemasonry, Gardner conceived of a celebratory religion whose focus was on the power of the natural world. Wiccan rituals generally begin with the drawing of a magic circle, offerings to the elements and the four directions, and continue with a series of rituals, incantations and chants whose power rests in the symbolic marriage of male and female. But does that amount to a religion? Vivianne Crowley says it does: \"A religion is a set of ritual acts and practices invoking or calling up the divine. By that definition, Wicca is undoubtedly a religion.\" One problem with Gardner's work, however, was that, in order to give Wicca the authority he felt it deserved, he couched its rituals and incantations in purple prose, stuffing in grandiose archaisms wherever he could fit them, so that, to the unconvinced, Wicca can seem rather absurd, all thees and thous and thereforeuntos. Even the Wiccan salutation - Blessed Be - is tinged with hey-nonny-no. Another problem is that Gardner appears to have been a bit of a perv. It was he who introduced into Wiccan ritual scourging, the practice of using flails or whips lightly to scourge the skin as an aid to concentration. This idea was not new - some Hindu and Christian sects still practise it - but there was no evidence that it had ever been part of witchcraft traditions. And his ideas about working \"skyclad\" or naked also raised some eyebrows. \"Yes, Gardner probably was a dirty old man and virtually illiterate and, no, there is no evidence for scourges elsewhere in any witchcraft literature,\" admits Graham King. Neither of these things appears to have put Wiccans off. \"Wicca is a surprisingly modern religion that draws on some ancient ideas,\" insists Crowley. \"Wicca venerates nature, and is associated with vegetarianism and animal rights. Its feminism and emphasis on individual responsibility matches people's perception of the world.\" But, I say, nudity, magic, the mysteries of nature, it's all a bit un-British, isn't it? On the contrary, says Ronald Hutton, professor of history at Bristol University. \"Wicca is very British - English, actually. We are the first nation to have industrialised and to have been acutely cut off from the natural world. Wicca is a response to that, a countercultural religion allowing people to link back with the land.\" A product of our history it may be, but does Wicca have a future? Since its inception 50 years ago, it has branched off and taken on local flavours. There are now radical feminist, gay and all-male Wiccan groups. \"Wicca is going through radical changes at the moment because of its growth,\" says Crowley. \"There's a much wider range of people now, and a lot of those getting involved are not seeking the occult but a modern spiritual practice. They're attracted to participatory ritual, and there's a hunger for a spiritual system that enhances lives by bringing about an inner change. And Wicca is celebratory.\" Wiccans themselves are optimistic. As Crowley says, \"Wicca has no paid leadership, no buildings, no capital: it's like a huge voluntary group, but it's survived 50 years.\" Professor Hutton, himself a druid, agrees: \"The fact that Wicca is a mystery religion and includes nudity and initiation rites means it will always shock the mainstream, but I think it will persist. Wicca is having a strong influence on rave and rock culture, eco-pagans and road protesters. The correspondence between magic and virtual reality means it also appeals to infotech workers. It's a religion for self-employed and self-reliant people, artisans and individualists, and it is currently finding its role as the clergy or inner ring to these groups. The 90s saw a remarkable pulling together of all the pagan strands.\" No one I spoke to had any ideas about the tarantula and the crow, by the way. The woman in my local pet shop wasn't missing a tarantula, though she pointed out that they are great escape artists. So I've decided the tarantula was a runaway pet. But as for the crow, well, I really don't know what to think about the crow",

But John Maynard Keynes wanted the country to know that those who cared about such things were taking steps to ensure that the brave new postwar world would not only have new social and economic policies, but something hitherto unheard of in British history: a cultural policy.</p> <p>\"I do not believe it is yet realised what an important thing has happened. State patronage of the arts has crept in. It has happened in a very English, informal, unostentatious way - half-baked. A semi-independent body is provided with modest funds.\" It was with these words that listeners to the BBC were informed in July 1945 of the creation of the Arts Council. The tensions which were to dog the Arts Council throughout its history were evident in the very terms of Keynes's celebratory remarks. 'Access' was to be in competition with 'excellence'; culture was at once lodged in the past as 'heritage', but also located in creative and participatory activities in the present.</p> <p>And aims were mixed in other ways, too: Keynes spoke of the need \"to make London a great artistic metropolis\", but also pledged the new body to \"let every part of Merry England be merry in its own way\" (the grand-opera-plus-morris-dancers view of 'culture'). The only really unequivocal statement was Keynes's cry from the heart interjected in the middle of his broadcast (and which no official spokesperson for the arts would dare to utter these days): \"Death to Hollywood.\"</p> <p>The history of the Arts Council is important not just because it became the main funding body for the arts, but because it functioned as a kind of microcosm of the relation between politics and culture in Britain in the second half of the 20th century. At first, the 'culture' it fostered largely corresponded to the traditional tastes of the cultivated elite; then in the 1960s and 70s, it attempted to do right by various forms of 'popular' culture; finally, in the 1980s and 90s it fell in with the prevailing economism of public discourse, treating culture as one of the 'leisure industries' which contributed to the GNP - or as the Thatcher-appointed Arts Council chairman, William Rees-Mogg, put it in 1985: \"The arts are to British tourism what the sun is to Spain.\"</p> <p>These developments were conditioned by social attitudes towards culture which had deep historical roots. Summarising ruthlessly, one might say that the dominant tradition in Britain had been an uneasy mixture of indifference, suspicion, and the largely unreflective perpetuation of the tastes of the traditional upper class. It has often been argued, most influentially by Matthew Arnold in the mid-19th century, that the pervasive impact of Protestantism, especially in its Puritan form, and the power of the commercial middle class in the world's first industrial nation combined to produce a suspicion of, or resistance to, culture that deserved to be called 'philistine'. But Britain's traditional elites, too, contributed to this uneasy relationship. The court and the metropolis were less the focus of upper class cultural life than in some other European countries; the landed classes tended rather to be provincial in their attachments and rural in their pursuits.</p> <p>It is true, of course, that historically most of the 'high art' forms were dependent upon the patronage of the wealthy classes, but in Britain even these were (and perhaps still are) primarily pursued as conventional elements in an established social season: where a visit to the opera at Covent Garden might be seen in much the same light as a cricket match at Lords or the regatta at Henley. This in turn helped to fortify popular hostility to these art forms and, although the labour movement's high regard for education has left its monuments in the statute-book in the form of public provision of schools and libraries, the arts have only attracted limited attention from the chief reforming governments of this century.</p> <p>Seen against this historical backdrop, the long absence in Britain of any kind of 'Ministry of Culture' is hardly surprising. In place of a 'cultural policy', Britain has had a miscellaneous collection of cultural institutions, with varying degrees of status and public support, whose operation has depended upon the shared values, social contacts and tacit agreements among leading members of the social and professional elites. Anything more explicit or systematic threatened to grate on those British sensibilities which detected a totalitarian resonance even to the phrase 'Ministry of Culture'. As Lord Goodman, the then Chairman of the Arts Council, drily remarked in the 1960s: \"One of the most precious freedoms of the British is freedom from culture.\"</p> <p>Prior to the second world war, the only public provision of culture took the form of the central government's responsibility for certain major museums and art galleries. The first steps towards the public provision for 'the arts' were prompted by a concern for the morale of the civilian population during the conflict itself. The Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts was set up in 1940; it was initially intended both to assist people to perform music and drama for themselves and to make the work of professional performers more widely accessible, though the latter aim soon predominated. In 1945 the warm glow of victory led many wartime expedients to be looked upon with favour, and all political parties concurred in transforming CEMA into the Arts Council. The establishment of the Arts Council may have represented a significant extension of the 'range' of activities receiving public support, but the 'means' adopted conformed to an established British pattern.</p> <p>The guiding principle remained that of 'arm's length' administration: that is, a system where public funds were not disbursed directly by a government department, as in most other European states, but were allocated to intermediate bodies which were charged with fulfilling certain public obligations - usually phrased in very general terms - and then left free to disburse the funds as they saw fit.</p> <p>As far as Westminster and Whitehall were concerned, both the level of political attention given to the arts and the size of the sums involved remained negligible for at least the first two decades after 1945. But then in 1965 the Labour government signalled its intention of pushing the topic up the political agenda by appointing a junior minister with special responsibility for the arts. In practice, subsequent governments, especially Conservative ones, tended to resist any expansion of the power and prestige of this office: the Arts portfolio was shuffled around various ministries, never commanding a ministry of its own, and so the minister concerned was in a correspondingly weak position when negotiating with the Treasury for an increase in its spending powers.</p> <p>Until 1992, the Arts Minister headed the Office of Arts and Libraries; it was a junior post which did not bring membership of the Cabinet. Inevitably in recent decades, with the heightened political profile of conservation and 'heritage' issues, with the greatly increased political clout of the 'tourist industry', and with the alleged economic benefits of a thriving 'arts sector', numerous issues which might in other countries be classified as the responsibility of the Ministry of Culture have come under the supervision and sometimes the control of government. But administratively these responsibilities remained dispersed until very recently. Thus, the Foreign Office oversaw the work of the British Council, the body whose task is to disseminate British culture abroad. The Department of the Environment was responsible for various historic buildings and other sites of national interest. The Home Office had overall responsibility for radio and television, though the cinema fell under the Department of Trade and Industry, while the Office of Arts and Libraries was administratively in the charge of the Lord President of the Council, having previously been under the Department of Education and Science.</p> <p>Some may see in this a wise Burkean system of internal checks and balances in which no one department has a monopoly of 'cultural policy'; others may see it as a characteristic muddle, only tolerated because the British have traditionally not taken 'culture' seriously enough to merit the formulation of effective procedures and policies for its support. From its beginnings, the Arts Council was subject to criticism from various quarters, especially on the grounds of its being too 'elitist' and taking too narrow a view of its functions. But there were also mounting misgivings about the way in which the council operated, and critics on both the left and the right of the political spectrum urged that its freedom be curtailed (generally urged by the right) or its constitution be altered (generally urged by the left). Neither the process of appointment to the main council and its panels nor the funding decisions they took were open to any kind of democratic control: much appeared to depend upon the close social links between members of the metropolitan elite.</p> <p>In this vein, it has been suggested that the reason why the independence of such bodies as the Arts Council involved no great tension with successive governments until the 1980s was that the members of these bodies so deeply shared the attitudes and values of the traditional political class. In the 1960s and 70s, as part of wider social changes, the council came under pressure to take a more democratic or popular view of the cultural activities that should be funded. To a limited extent the council did extend the range of its clients, though one of the main consequences is that it came under further criticism from Tory backbenchers who complained that public money was being used to support 'indecent', 'subversive', or simply 'mediocre' artistic activities. In fact, it is clear that for some time now the Arts Council has uncomfortably juggled various, not always consistent, criteria in making its decisions.</p> <p>In the mid-1980s, under Rees-Mogg, it thumpingly declared its commitment to 'excellence', but taken narrowly this was always bound to conflict with the council\u00cds duty, as laid down in its charter, \"to increase the accessibility of the arts to the public throughout Great Britain\". The relative autonomy accorded to the Regional Arts Councils further complicated the picture, since they tended to look more favourably on a variety of 'community' or participatory activities than had the parent council. Although the big cultural satrapies such as Covent Garden, ENO, the National Theatre and the RSC were always its major clients, the overwhelming bulk of the support provided by the council was in smaller grants to a huge variety of organisations - dance companies, local theatres, individual writers, poetry magazines, crafts associations, and so on.</p> <p>The Thatcher governments of the 1980s exercised one obvious kind of influence by their reductions in the real value of the arts budget, but they also exercised a more insidious influence by manipulating the system of appointments to the relevant public bodies along simple partisan lines. Thus, for example, in 1980, shortly after the Tories had taken power, the self-made businessman Alastair McAlpine was nominated for membership of the Arts Council. There was immediate protest, since not only did McAlpine have no obvious qualifications or experience in the arts world, but he had already noisily expressed his opposition to any public subsidy to the arts. The protest was overridden by the arts minister's revelation that \"this nomination comes from a very high source\"; McAlpine has been one of Mrs Thatcher's closest supporters and a fervent advocate of 'free-market' policies.</p> <p>Then in 1982 Richard Hoggart, a literary and cultural critic with a distinguished career in education (and a man of moderate Guardian-reading leftwing views) who had for some years served very effectively as vice-chairman of the Arts Council, was abruptly dismissed. This was contrary to established practice and against the stated wishes of the chairman and the rest of the council. When pressed, the (Tory) arts minister confessed it was because \"Number 10 doesn't like him\". Rees-Mogg was appointed as chairman the following year. When Roy Shaw, the long-serving secretary-general of the Arts Council, retired later the same year, he wrote an article for the council's Bulletin regretting this increasing politicisation of appointments. Rees-Mogg attempted to prevent the publication of the article, which only led to its receiving vastly greater publicity by its appearance in the Observer.</p> <p>The official view in the closing decades of the century was that any shortfalls in public provision would soon be made up by private sponsorship, but the problems with this assumption have become increasingly clear. Sponsorship is another form of advertising, and thus introduces its own demands, whether in the form of opera programmes printed in the colours of a well-known cigarette company or, more worryingly, of pressures towards 'safe' and uncontroversial events. The one new ministry set up by John Major after his election victory in 1992 was the Department of National Heritage, embracing tourism, sport and the arts. The title aptly reflected the prime minister's sepia-tinted views: village greens and country houses are part of the nation's 'heritage', experimental theatre and minimalist art are not.</p> <p>In practice, what really transformed the relation of government to the arts were the huge yields from the new national lottery. The capital infrastructure of culture became heavily dependent on what Adam Smith famously described as \"a tax on ignorance\"; regular funding channelled through the Arts Council was now only part of the story. After Labour's victory in 1997, the title 'the Ministry of Culture' was finally established. It retains broadly the same heterogeneous remit, which reflects the current deep confusion about the distinctive nature and value of art. In so far as there is an organising principle, it is economic: these activities are grouped together as a category of 'optional' consumer choices, they are 'leisure industries'. By the end of the 20th century, costume dramas had become the emblematic 'product', milking heritage to help the export drive. 'Death to Hollywood' has mutated into 'long live Merchant Ivory'.</p> <p>Broadly speaking, therefore, what has happened is that one, largely extraneous and inherited, form of confidence has been eroded without being replaced by another which would allow discriminations of quality to be persuasively made on intrinsic rather than merely instrumental grounds. We are now encouraged to think of works of art not as expressing some of the deepest probings of the human condition, but as leisure products whose 're-branding' will contribute to 'national competitiveness'. While this is the prevailing official ethos, we had perhaps better hope that the familiar lack of a 'cultural policy' in Britain continues, thereby at least allowing a little genuine creative expression to be fostered in the cracks.</p> <p><b> What the men in suits said about the state of British culture:</b><br></p> <p><b>1946</b><br> \"By provision of concert halls, modern libraries, theatres and suitable centres we desire to assure our people full access to the great heritage of culture in this nation...

      "body": "<p>Tweedy. Decent. Upright. Progressive. The best new British architecture of 50 years ago seems terribly staid at the beginning of the 21st century. And it was. Modern Movement ideas that had swept a clean broom through much of Europe and the United States between 1918 and 1945, settled late in Britain and made relatively little impact until some 10 years after VJ Day. Why? Because they were foreign, couldn't be trusted and were associated with Communists, Jews, intellectuals and other such groups who were only just tolerated in imperial, blimpish Britain.</p> <p>The war against Hitler allowed Britain to change, a little. On one level it was a chance to rebuild the physical fabric of blitzed towns and cities with new forms of architecture and construction that drew their inspiration in part from the mass production techniques and materials that had done so much to help the Allies towards victory from D-Day. Many of the most progressive post-war architects had experienced front-line action whether as a paratroopers like Big Jim Stirling (1924-92; one of Britain's most inventive post-war talents) or as engineer-officers like Denys Lasdun (1914-), who oversaw the construction of instant airfields for British and American fighters in Normandy during the Allied landings.</p> <p>When they came to build, such architects brought together the lessons of victorious wartime technology, the abstract thinking of Modernism and a genuine desire to raise the standard of life for everyman, not just for the fashionable and wealthy who had commissioned the few Modern Movement houses to be built in these sceptred isles before Hitler's invasion of Poland. They were fortunate, these architects, because the public sector was dominant in Attlee's Britain and in many ways was to remain so right through until the 'oil crisis' of 1973-4 - when the economy all but collapsed and the country went into a kind of political and economic abeyance until the emergence of Thatcherism and the wholesale and wilful trashing of the public realm.</p> <p>It's in those limbo years of the mid-70s when very little new architecture of any worth was built in punky 'Third World' Britain, that our home-based experience of modern architecture changed dramatically.

      "bodyText": "Tweedy. Decent. Upright. Progressive. The best new British architecture of 50 years ago seems terribly staid at the beginning of the 21st century. And it was. Modern Movement ideas that had swept a clean broom through much of Europe and the United States between 1918 and 1945, settled late in Britain and made relatively little impact until some 10 years after VJ Day. Why? Because they were foreign, couldn't be trusted and were associated with Communists, Jews, intellectuals and other such groups who were only just tolerated in imperial, blimpish Britain. The war against Hitler allowed Britain to change, a little. On one level it was a chance to rebuild the physical fabric of blitzed towns and cities with new forms of architecture and construction that drew their inspiration in part from the mass production techniques and materials that had done so much to help the Allies towards victory from D-Day. Many of the most progressive post-war architects had experienced front-line action whether as a paratroopers like Big Jim Stirling (1924-92; one of Britain's most inventive post-war talents) or as engineer-officers like Denys Lasdun (1914-), who oversaw the construction of instant airfields for British and American fighters in Normandy during the Allied landings. When they came to build, such architects brought together the lessons of victorious wartime technology, the abstract thinking of Modernism and a genuine desire to raise the standard of life for everyman, not just for the fashionable and wealthy who had commissioned the few Modern Movement houses to be built in these sceptred isles before Hitler's invasion of Poland. They were fortunate, these architects, because the public sector was dominant in Attlee's Britain and in many ways was to remain so right through until the 'oil crisis' of 1973-4 - when the economy all but collapsed and the country went into a kind of political and economic abeyance until the emergence of Thatcherism and the wholesale and wilful trashing of the public realm. It's in those limbo years of the mid-70s when very little new architecture of any worth was built in punky 'Third World' Britain, that our home-based experience of modern architecture changed dramatically. The large public offices that had employed thousands of salaried architects, who designed prefabricated housing estates, local authority schools, general hospitals, civic centres and new universities, closed. And with them the often earnest, wholemeal style of public architecture that had developed in Britain since 1945, and all those proper, quasi-scientific concerns for proper levels of daylight and ventilation in ordinary people's homes. Who cared now that the greasy hand of the market would shape the new economically liberal Britain? Whatever the social consequences of wiping out the notion of public duty, of a civic and civil society (perhaps these had never been more than myths), British architecture was liberated from the sense of worthiness that had made it appear so very tweedy and, if nourishing, nourishing in the way that wartime rationing had been. The culture and needs of the free market saw hi-tech fly and postmodernism dance to the tune of unbridled capitalism. The buildings that mattered now were deep-plan office blocks for the deregulated finance industry, shopping malls, out-of-town superstores, call centres, distribution depots and flash, trash Abigail's Party-style housing for Sierra people with padded shoulders and mobile phones so big they might well have needed planning permission.

Behind them stands a 20-year tradition of national debate with all the associated fluttering futility of white papers and annual education acts. Every summer they and their schools were league-tabled and categorised to within an inch of their project-led lives as they clutched their folders and did their field work. Ministers - Tory and Labour - acclaimed the dizzying rise in their exam results. Never have so many been assessed by so many, and to such congratulatory effect. All the boxes were ticked for understanding, creativity and empathy.</p> <p>The only problem is that Britain's 18- to 24-year-olds - our GCSE generation - seem rather ignorant. They may have their neuroses. Only 47% can identify Sigmund Freud as a psychiatrist. Lucian painted in vain; while the poet laureate's evocation of the Queen Mother's hats has passed them by. Whether profound or trivial, for young Britannia, the cultural happens to other people. Perhaps youth is another country where they do things differently. Perhaps behind this litany of ignorance there lurks a parallel universe of excitingly contemporary artistic relevance that escapes this particular scrutiny. Perhaps the GCSE-ites are more interested in the glories of mute Miltons who lurk outside the net of the Great Tradition. Yet, two-thirds of them can't even identify JK Rowling as the author of Harry Potter.</p> <p>The most bleak conclusions of ICM's cultural poll relate to the canonic: to events, authors, discoveries and achievements which seem so fundamental that you don't need to check that they're still remembered. That is why the poll shocks. The causes behind this modern Dunciad's arrival are many. The stale old English cocktail of class and education always did reserve culture for the few. But there are some modern kicks in it these days. There's the ease of the left-right consensus which lies behind the modern British philistinism in education and all that noisy Benthamite busybodyism. On the left there's the fear that canonised excellence always reflects a petrified authoritarianism. On the right there's been a parallel paranoia: the pursuit of 'relevance' and the invention of a regulatory state in the name of educational 'market forces'. Both have created rootlessness and ignorance.</p> <p>In Russia, 10-year-olds learn Lermontov's Borodino by heart; 90% of Britain's young adults can't identify Waterloo as the main conflict of 1815. Perhaps national suffering is a better nurse of culture than GDP contentment. But why should this cultural deracination matter? A fact is a stubborn thing, wonderful in its power to puncture pretension and deflate a theory. Our mass entertainment culture has been good at spreading materialistic egalitarianism.

      "bodyText": "Half of them either are - or will be - graduates. Behind them stands a 20-year tradition of national debate with all the associated fluttering futility of white papers and annual education acts. Every summer they and their schools were league-tabled and categorised to within an inch of their project-led lives as they clutched their folders and did their field work. Ministers - Tory and Labour - acclaimed the dizzying rise in their exam results. Never have so many been assessed by so many, and to such congratulatory effect. All the boxes were ticked for understanding, creativity and empathy. The only problem is that Britain's 18- to 24-year-olds - our GCSE generation - seem rather ignorant. They may have their neuroses. Only 47% can identify Sigmund Freud as a psychiatrist. Lucian painted in vain; while the poet laureate's evocation of the Queen Mother's hats has passed them by. Whether profound or trivial, for young Britannia, the cultural happens to other people. Perhaps youth is another country where they do things differently. Perhaps behind this litany of ignorance there lurks a parallel universe of excitingly contemporary artistic relevance that escapes this particular scrutiny. Perhaps the GCSE-ites are more interested in the glories of mute Miltons who lurk outside the net of the Great Tradition. Yet, two-thirds of them can't even identify JK Rowling as the author of Harry Potter. The most bleak conclusions of ICM's cultural poll relate to the canonic: to events, authors, discoveries and achievements which seem so fundamental that you don't need to check that they're still remembered. That is why the poll shocks. The causes behind this modern Dunciad's arrival are many. The stale old English cocktail of class and education always did reserve culture for the few. But there are some modern kicks in it these days. There's the ease of the left-right consensus which lies behind the modern British philistinism in education and all that noisy Benthamite busybodyism. On the left there's the fear that canonised excellence always reflects a petrified authoritarianism. On the right there's been a parallel paranoia: the pursuit of 'relevance' and the invention of a regulatory state in the name of educational 'market forces'. Both have created rootlessness and ignorance. In Russia, 10-year-olds learn Lermontov's Borodino by heart; 90% of Britain's young adults can't identify Waterloo as the main conflict of 1815. Perhaps national suffering is a better nurse of culture than GDP contentment. But why should this cultural deracination matter? A fact is a stubborn thing, wonderful in its power to puncture pretension and deflate a theory. Our mass entertainment culture has been good at spreading materialistic egalitarianism. The stuffiness of the old hierarchies have gone. But in its place has arrived a glibness, an ability to talk a good game, and the talent to ape the chat-show presenter and the confessionalist interviewee. Getting away with it and larging it are now important national characteristics. Killer facts are lethal blows against the glib bullshitter. But knowing elementary things about who, where and when becomes a rare virtue. This knowledge is important because it both humbles and inspires. To know what others have achieved is to recognise genius and glimpse self-sacrifice. It provides a scale, rather than a dispiriting shadow cast by the past on the present.

      "body": "<p>Craig Masson and Andrew McMinn recently threw a \"very tropical and exotic party, to celebrate 10 years of married bliss\". The invitations, which flew out of canary-yellow envelopes, were a zazz of hearts, flowers and glittery palm trees. There was a strict dress code (Carmen Miranda, Hula Boy, Showgirl, Tarzan, Knickerbocker Glory, etc), and though I didn't make it myself, the \"boyz and girlz\" who did spilled out of the Miami kitchen and the rococo-colonial lounge into the garden, where they mingled with pink plastic flamingos and drank oceans of fizz under strings of dangly party lights shaped like pineapples, bananas and slices of watermelon. </p> <p>Masson and McMinn, who drop words such as \"poptastic\" into normal conversation and wear Hawaiian shirts as part of their day-wear, were dressed as the Beatles in Sgt Pepper mode. They had given the hall floor a coat of lurid green paint for the occasion. Even the garden statuary was wearing orange taffeta. That's the kind of fun guys they are - but you don't have to go to one of their parties to enjoy a little of the light they shed on life. </p> <p>The couple are the founders of Kitschen Sync, the two-store London retailer that trades in \"a glorious kitsch-a-rama of flashy, trashy trinkets\". Their shops (one in Clapham, another in Covent Garden) offer a world of gnomes, snowstorms and Sputnik lights, cocktail swizzle sticks, lips, lanterns and glitter mirrorballs - all presented in the display cabinet equivalent of retro 50s kitchen units. Their mail-order catalogue is 18 colour pages of jokey product placement: \"Having a party in a dinghy? Don't forget the inflatable ice bucket!\" (Yours for \u00a32.50.) </p> <p>In essence, they specialise in cheap crap (rubber goldfish, glow-in-the-dark goddesses, fuzzy dice, funky phones and all manner of frivolous fakery from fruit and foliage to fur), but Kitschen Sync's founders don't believe in palming off any old cheap crap - their business was born out of a genuine affection for the gaudy colour and good humour of classic bad taste. Not only have they travelled the world - China, Mexico, India, Thailand, Holland and, um, Enfield - to find the stuff, but there's barely anything in their shops that they wouldn't have in their own home. </p> <p>\"Our kitchen is very Kitschen Sync,\" agrees Craig, when I join them for breakfast in Victorian- terraced Balham, where we sit around a retro table in chrome and lemon-yellow laminate (\u00a3275) on matching vinyl chairs (\u00a3120 each), surrounded by Formica (bespoke units by their Covent Garden shopfitter; colour scheme by Marge and Homer Simpson). The table is set with leopard-print mats and co-ordinating paper napkins. \"More tea, vicar?\" asks Andrew before refilling my jolly mug (a discontinued line) from an even jollier teapot decorated with poodles and Lassie lookalikes (a gift from a friend). </p> <p>Kitschen Sync, they tell me between mouthfuls of sticky chocolate croissant, was originally inspired by a shop in Amsterdam that they came across during a weekend break in 1997. \"Most of the stuff was from Mexico,\" says Craig. \"There was lots of colourful plastic, all very fun and quirky. We didn't think it was as cheap as it should have been, but we were sure there was a place for a similar shop in London.\" At the time, neither of them was looking for a business opportunity - Craig was a freelance display designer, Andrew a lingerie merchandiser for House of Fraser - but the idea took root and grew. </p> <p>The concept and, indeed, the name, Kitschen Sync, was dreamed up on the Eurostar on the way home from Amsterdam. Within a few months, they had found a maker to produce their own-designed leopard-print candles; Craig had set up a market stall to fund the time spent on drawing up a business plan; and every spare moment was spent sourcing suitable material. \"We look for quirky design and fantastic colour,\" says Andrew. \"But we also cater for nostalgia - things that people remember as kids, like plastic polka-dot beakers or Duralex glasses from Woollies.\" </p> <p>There is also an element of imported souvenirs. One of their bestsellers (and one of their personal favourites) is an \"exuberant, flamboyant\" Mexican Corona beer tray, featuring a sunny senorita in a scarlet sombrero. \"When you think about the icons of kitsch, it's often the stuff that people bring back from holiday,\" says Andrew. \"People are seduced by these things - the donkeys, the flamenco dolls, the windmills from Amsterdam - but when they get them home they look alien, they stand out. And I suppose that's what we sell ... things that stand out.\" </p> <p>At Masson and McMinn's effervescent home, almost everything stands out in one way or another. The only kind of magnolia they would tolerate is in fake flower form. They don't go in for \"white goods\", either (the fridge is yellow). Their fearless use of colour has no inhibitions - those Miami-style units in the kitchen, for example, mix lemon with mint and rose pink with sky blue; the floor is a harlequin of blue and green tiles; the walls are turquoise and yellow; and the paintwork is a hot, hot pink. </p> <p>The living room, according to Craig, \"is kitschy colonial ... a bit rococo-y, a bit Pierre and Gilles\". To get the look (Andrew calls it \"tongue in chic\"), line all walls with animal-print wallpaper. Cover one in a collection of gilded sunburst clocks and mirrors, dating from the 30s to the 50s. Add two large \"lovely jubbly\" sofas in tiger-print, place a tall \"kitschy religious\" Virgin Mary in one corner and drape garlands of fake flowers, \u00e0 la South Pacific, down the windows. They have also raided their storeroom for multi-coloured chandeliers (a Kitschen Sync speciality, \"fashioned from real plastic\", from \u00a319 each) and flocked plastic deer heads (\"that grand hall look without the taxidermy\", \u00a312.50). Most people couldn't live with one of the latter; Masson and McMinn have an entire herd of them mounted on a bright red wall. </p> <p>But the living room is a model of sobriety compared with the \"70s disco\" bathroom. Here, a fuchsia-painted roll-top tub sits on a raised platform surrounded by wall-to-floor mosaics in psychedelic colours - yellow, blue, turquoise, more hot pink, a bit of scorching pink, a touch of green. The ceiling is all mirrored mosaics. The wall above the tub is lined with original 70s vinyl wallpaper in more shades of puce and pink. And the bathroom is not even finished yet. \"What's missing is some Top Of The Pops album covers for the walls and a big swivelling bucket chair - all plastic and shiny,\" says Craig. \"And we'd like one of those 70s display cupboards, y'know with flaps, and doors, mirrors and lights.\" Mmmm, lovely. </p> <p>Few people have the courage or the inclination to go to these extremes, but Masson and McMinn believe that Kitschen Sync has successfully filled a niche in modern retro interiors. \"We are not trying to sell a whole package or a whole concept,\" says Andrew. \"What we offer is accents of colour and touches of humour. Even people with lovely, tasteful kitchens will throw in a shocking pink kettle for fun, or something wacky in the bathroom like a fluffy pedestal mat.\" </p> <p>Kitschen Sync, they say, is a \"fashion shop\", responding to whimsical trends (snakeskin is the new leopard print, apparently), but it caters for all tastes. Oh, really? \"Yeah, I think there's something here for everyone,\" says Craig. </p> <p>When I test out the theory with a visit to their Clapham shop, I go into kitsch-a-rama overdrive and am seduced into buying a Barrier Reef shower curtain (\"a taste of warm tropical waters without the risk of becoming a shark's hors d'oeuvre,\" \u00a319), one of those Corona beer trays (\u00a310), two strings of fruity party lights (\u00a315 each), a squeezy tomato ketchup bottle (\u00a33) and a square foot of realistic fake grass sprigged with spring flowers (I haven't got a clue what I'm going to do with it but, at \u00a33.75, who cares?). </p> <p>According to Andrew and Craig, I am a fairly typical customer, combining gift-buying and impulse purchases with a little light home accessorising. But there are all sorts of Kitschen Sync shoppers. Some wouldn't dream of crossing the threshold, but others are addicts. \"You'd be surprised by the number of customers who tell us they've got everything we sell,\" says Craig. \"And we are still catering for those who actually have, well, dubious taste,\" says Andrew. \"There is an element of people who don't see the irony. There's no tongue in their cheeks. They buy stuff because they genuinely think it's nice.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Kitschen Sync, 9 The Pavement, Clapham, London SW4, and 7 Earlham Street, Covent Garden, London WC2.

To get the look (Andrew calls it \"tongue in chic\"), line all walls with animal-print wallpaper. Cover one in a collection of gilded sunburst clocks and mirrors, dating from the 30s to the 50s. Add two large \"lovely jubbly\" sofas in tiger-print, place a tall \"kitschy religious\" Virgin Mary in one corner and drape garlands of fake flowers, \u00e0 la South Pacific, down the windows. They have also raided their storeroom for multi-coloured chandeliers (a Kitschen Sync speciality, \"fashioned from real plastic\", from \u00a319 each) and flocked plastic deer heads (\"that grand hall look without the taxidermy\", \u00a312.50). Most people couldn't live with one of the latter; Masson and McMinn have an entire herd of them mounted on a bright red wall. But the living room is a model of sobriety compared with the \"70s disco\" bathroom. Here, a fuchsia-painted roll-top tub sits on a raised platform surrounded by wall-to-floor mosaics in psychedelic colours - yellow, blue, turquoise, more hot pink, a bit of scorching pink, a touch of green. The ceiling is all mirrored mosaics. The wall above the tub is lined with original 70s vinyl wallpaper in more shades of puce and pink. And the bathroom is not even finished yet. \"What's missing is some Top Of The Pops album covers for the walls and a big swivelling bucket chair - all plastic and shiny,\" says Craig. \"And we'd like one of those 70s display cupboards, y'know with flaps, and doors, mirrors and lights.\" Mmmm, lovely. Few people have the courage or the inclination to go to these extremes, but Masson and McMinn believe that Kitschen Sync has successfully filled a niche in modern retro interiors. \"We are not trying to sell a whole package or a whole concept,\" says Andrew. \"What we offer is accents of colour and touches of humour. Even people with lovely, tasteful kitchens will throw in a shocking pink kettle for fun, or something wacky in the bathroom like a fluffy pedestal mat.\" Kitschen Sync, they say, is a \"fashion shop\", responding to whimsical trends (snakeskin is the new leopard print, apparently), but it caters for all tastes. Oh, really? \"Yeah, I think there's something here for everyone,\" says Craig. When I test out the theory with a visit to their Clapham shop, I go into kitsch-a-rama overdrive and am seduced into buying a Barrier Reef shower curtain (\"a taste of warm tropical waters without the risk of becoming a shark's hors d'oeuvre,\" \u00a319), one of those Corona beer trays (\u00a310), two strings of fruity party lights (\u00a315 each), a squeezy tomato ketchup bottle (\u00a33) and a square foot of realistic fake grass sprigged with spring flowers (I haven't got a clue what I'm going to do with it but, at \u00a33.75, who cares?). According to Andrew and Craig, I am a fairly typical customer, combining gift-buying and impulse purchases with a little light home accessorising. But there are all sorts of Kitschen Sync shoppers. Some wouldn't dream of crossing the threshold, but others are addicts. \"You'd be surprised by the number of customers who tell us they've got everything we sell,\" says Craig. \"And we are still catering for those who actually have, well, dubious taste,\" says Andrew. \"There is an element of people who don't see the irony. There's no tongue in their cheeks. They buy stuff because they genuinely think it's nice.\" \u0095 Kitschen Sync, 9 The Pavement, Clapham, London SW4, and 7 Earlham Street, Covent Garden, London WC2.
